methods that have variable scales, rotation and translation. Registering
hyperspectral images of two dimensional materials is particularly difficult due
to the lack of keypoints on unprepared substrates. Identifying variations in
the strain of these samples can assist in the registration of these samples by
creating keypoints to correlate images. Registration of these images allow for
multimodal analysis from these various instruments by aligning multiple images
into a single coordinate space. This is done by Hough transformations and
arbitrary resolution definitions to generate a new coordinate frame where
spatial information may be preserved and correlated on a pixel by pixel basis.
Such multimodal image alignment may be used to correlate data from various
instruments. Strain information is extracted from the Raman spectra and the
resulting hyperspectral image is used to register the Raman information with
the other modes of microscopy.

mechanisms are proposed for solving the regression problem. The models can be
regarded as extensions of the attention-based random forest whose idea stems
from applying a combination of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression and the
Huber's contamination model to random forests. The self-attention aims to
capture dependencies of the tree predictions and to remove noise or anomalous
predictions in the random forest. The self-attention module is trained jointly
with the attention module for computing weights. It is shown that the training
process of attention weights is reduced to solving a single quadratic or linear
optimization problem. Three modifications of the general approach are proposed
and compared. A specific multi-head self-attention for the random forest is
also considered. Heads of the self-attention are obtained by changing its
tuning parameters including the kernel parameters and the contamination
parameter of models. Numerical experiments with various datasets illustrate the
proposed models and show that the supplement of the self-attention improves the
model performance for many datasets.

effect is an important task, and the segmentation of the weld section is the
basis of the assessment. This paper proposes an industrial weld segmentation
network based on a deep learning semantic segmentation algorithm fused with
heatmap detail guidance and Image Matting to solve the automatic segmentation
problem of weld regions. In the existing semantic segmentation networks, the
boundary information can be preserved by fusing the features of both high-level
and low-level layers. However, this method can lead to insufficient expression
of the spatial information in the low-level layer, resulting in inaccurate
segmentation boundary positioning. We propose a detailed guidance module based
on heatmaps to fully express the segmented region boundary information in the
low-level network to address this problem. Specifically, the expression of
boundary information can be enhanced by adding a detailed branch to predict
segmented boundary and then matching it with the boundary heat map generated by
mask labels to calculate the mean square error loss. In addition, although deep
learning has achieved great success in the field of semantic segmentation, the
precision of the segmentation boundary region is not high due to the loss of
detailed information caused by the classical segmentation network in the
process of encoding and decoding process. This paper introduces a matting
algorithm to calibrate the boundary of the segmentation region of the semantic
segmentation network to solve this problem. Through many experiments on
industrial weld data sets, the effectiveness of our method is demonstrated, and
the MIOU reaches 97.93%. It is worth noting that this performance is comparable
to human manual segmentation ( MIOU 97.96%).

it is not well addressed in standard textbooks on generalized linear models.
The lack of exposition is attributed to the fact that when outcome data are
discrete, classical methods (e.g., Pearson/deviance residual analysis and
goodness-of-fit tests) have limited utility in model diagnostics and treatment.
This paper establishes a novel framework for model diagnostics of discrete data
regression. Unlike the literature defining a single-valued quantity as the
residual, we propose to use a function as a vehicle to retain the residual
information. In the presence of discreteness, we show that such a functional
residual is appropriate for summarizing the residual randomness that cannot be
captured by the structural part of the model. We establish its theoretical
properties, which leads to the innovation of new diagnostic tools including the
functional-residual-vs covariate plot and Function-to-Function (Fn-Fn) plot.
Our numerical studies demonstrate that the use of these tools can reveal a
variety of model misspecifications, such as not properly including a
higher-order term, an explanatory variable, an interaction effect, a dispersion
parameter, or a zero-inflation component. The functional residual yields, as a
byproduct, Liu-Zhang's surrogate residual mainly developed for cumulative link
models for ordinal data (Liu and Zhang, 2018, JASA). As a general notion, it
considerably broadens the diagnostic scope as it applies to virtually all
parametric models for binary, ordinal and count data, all in a unified
diagnostic scheme.

has thus far focused mainly on nonparametric regression, especially on point
estimation. In this paper, the construction of confidence sets for the level
set of linear regression is considered. In particular, $1-\alpha$ level upper,
lower and two-sided confidence sets are constructed for the normal-error linear
regression. It is shown that these confidence sets can be easily constructed
from the corresponding $1-\alpha$ level simultaneous confidence bands. It is
also pointed out that the construction method is readily applicable to other
parametric regression models where the mean response depends on a linear
predictor through a monotonic link function, which include generalized linear
models, linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models. Therefore the
method proposed in this paper is widely applicable. Examples are given to
illustrate the method.

collisions as building blocks of the Alfvenic cascade and their interplay with
magnetic reconnection at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales. Depending on the
large-scale nonlinearity parameter $\chi_0$ (the ratio between AW linear
propagation time and nonlinear turnover time), different regimes are observed.
For strong nonlinearities ($\chi_0\sim1$), turbulence is consistent with a
dynamically aligned, critically balanced cascade--fluctuations exhibit a
scale-dependent alignment $\sin\theta_k\propto k_\perp^{-1/4}$, a
$k_\perp^{-3/2}$ spectrum and $k_\|\propto k_\perp^{1/2}$ spectral anisotropy.
At weaker nonlinearities (small $\chi_0$), a spectral break marking the
transition between a large-scale weak regime and a small-scale
$k_\perp^{-11/5}$ tearing-mediated range emerges, implying that dynamic
alignment occurs also for weak nonlinearities. At $\chi_0<1$ the alignment
angle $\theta_{k_\perp}$ shows a stronger scale dependence than in the
$\chi_0\sim1$ regime, i.e. $\sin\theta_k\propto k_\perp^{-1/2}$ at
$\chi_0\sim0.5$, and $\sin\theta_k\propto k_\perp^{-1}$ at $\chi_0\sim0.1$.
Dynamic alignment in the weak regime also modifies the large-scale spectrum,
scaling roughly as $k_\perp^{-3/2}$ for $\chi_0\sim0.5$ and as $k_\perp^{-1}$
for $\chi_0\sim0.1$. A phenomenological theory of dynamically aligned
turbulence at weak nonlinearities that can explain these spectra and the
transition to the tearing-mediated regime is provided; at small $\chi_0$, the
strong scale dependence of the alignment angle combines with the increased
lifetime of turbulent eddies to allow tearing to onset and mediate the cascade
at scales that can be larger than those predicted for a critically balanced
cascade by several orders of magnitude. Such a transition to tearing-mediated
turbulence may even supplant the usual weak-to-strong transition.

formulate a min-max optimization problem over the model parameters by
explicitly reasoning about the robustness criteria in terms of additive
perturbations to time-series inputs measured by the global alignment kernel
(GAK) based distance. We also show the generality and advantages of our
formulation using the summation structure over time-series alignments by
relating both GAK and dynamic time warping (DTW). This problem is an instance
of a family of compositional min-max optimization problems, which are
challenging and open with unclear theoretical guarantee. We propose a
principled stochastic compositional alternating gradient descent ascent
(SCAGDA) algorithm for this family of optimization problems. Unlike traditional
methods for time-series that require approximate computation of distance
measures, SCAGDA approximates the GAK based distance on-the-fly using a moving
average approach. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of SCAGDA and
provide strong theoretical support for the estimation of GAK based distance.

maintaining fluid-like positional disorder within layers, smectics are
excellent systems for exploring topology, defects and geometric memory in
complex confining geometries. However, the coexistence of crystalline-like
characteristics in one direction and fluid-like disorder within layers makes
lamellar liquid crystals notoriously difficult to model - especially in the
presence of defects and large distortions. Nematic properties of smectics can
be comprehensively described by the Q-tensor but to capture the features of the
smectic layering alone, we develop a phenomenological Landau theory for a
complex-tensor order parameter E, which is capable of describing the local
degree of lamellar ordering, layer displacement, and orientation of the layers.
This theory can account for both parallel and perpendicular elastic
contributions. In addition to resolving the potential ambiguities inherent to

data to predict the preferences of users. Deep neural network (DNN) models such
as neural collaborative filtering (NCF) are increasingly popular. However, the
tangibility and trustworthiness of the recommendations are questionable due to
the complexity and lack of explainability of the models. To enable
explainability, recent techniques such as ACCENT and FIA are looking for
counterfactual explanations that are specific historical actions of a user, the
removal of which leads to a change to the recommendation result. In this work,
we present a general framework for both DNN and non-DNN models so that the
counterfactual explainers all belong to it with specific choices of components.
This framework first estimates the influence of a certain historical action
after its removal and then uses search algorithms to find the minimal set of
such actions for the counterfactual explanation. With this framework, we are
able to investigate the relationship between the explainers and recommenders.
We empirically study two recommender models (NCF and Factorization Machine) and
two datasets (MovieLens and Yelp). We analyze the relationship between the
performance of the recommender and the quality of the explainer. We observe
that with standard evaluation metrics, the explainers deliver worse performance
when the recommendations are more accurate. This indicates that having good
explanations to correct predictions is harder than having them to wrong
predictions. The community needs more fine-grained evaluation metrics to
measure the quality of counterfactual explanations to recommender systems.

Survey (SDSS), we calculate virial masses of a sample of approximately 126,000
LTGs from the sixteenth data release of the SDSS. The virial mass estimations
were made considering Newtonian mechanics, virial equilibrium and velocity
dispersion from stars and gas. The procedure gave as a result seven mass
estimations for each galaxy. The calculated masses were calibrated using a
sample of spiral galaxies with velocity rotation curves. Considering the
results from the calibration, we find that the correlation between virial and
dynamical (rotation curve) masses is stronger for high inclination values.
Therefore the calibration relies more on the available data for higher
inclination angle galaxies. We also show that if we have a heterogeneous sample
of galaxies one must take into consideration the size and colour of these
galaxies by using the following variables: Sersic index n, concentration index
and colour of the stars. For relatively smaller and bluer LTGs the gas velocity
dispersion provides a more consistent mass calculation, while for LTGs that are
relatively larger and redder the stellar velocity dispersion provides a better
correlated mass calculation.

domain, existing methods for unpaired image transfer are commonly based on
cycle-consistency, causing additional computational resources and instability
due to the learning of an inverse mapping. This paper presents a novel method
for uni-directional domain mapping that does not rely on any paired training
data. A proper transfer is achieved by using a GAN architecture and a novel
generator loss based on patch invariance. To be more specific, the generator
outputs are evaluated and compared at different scales, also leading to an
increased focus on high-frequency details as well as an implicit data
augmentation. This novel patch loss also offers the possibility to accurately
predict aleatoric uncertainty by modeling an input-dependent scale map for the
patch residuals. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on three
well-established medical databases. As compared to four state-of-the-art

an efficient method for constructing a tensor train decomposition of a tensor

remarkable performance in practical applications, its theoretical analysis, in
particular regarding the error of the approximation, is so far lacking. To our
knowledge, existing results only provide element-wise approximation accuracy
guarantees, which lead to a very loose bound when extended to the entire
tensor. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing accuracy guarantees in
terms of the entire tensor for both exact and noisy measurements. Our results
illustrate how the choice of selected subtensors affects the quality of the
cross approximation and that the approximation error caused by model error
and/or measurement error may not grow exponentially with the order of the
tensor. These results are verified by numerical experiments, and may have
important implications for the usefulness of cross approximations for
high-order tensors, such as those encountered in the description of quantum

fluid, which means a substance that flows under an applied shear stress. In
this sense fluids form a wide subset of the phases of matter that includes
liquids, dense gases, plasmas, and to some extent even plastic solids. Fluidity
is one of the main dynamical characteristics that depends strongly on the
details of the local structure. And vice versa, dominant details of local
structural ordering in the arrangement of particles on some time scales are
important for understanding the dynamics of fluids. The orderliness over
distances comparable to the inter-particle distances is usually treated as the
short-range order, whereas the orderliness repeated over infinitely large
distances is called the long-range order. Both are absent in the ideal gas, but
liquids and amorphous solids exhibit the short-range order. The physics of
crystalline solids with the long-range order is well understood. In fluids,
however, the atomic structure is changing with time. How are specific features
of structural ordering reflected in the fluid dynamics? In this chapter we try
to find answers to some old and new questions that still make the fluid
dynamics still very attractive for the theoretical studies.

the pulsatile period $T$ was kept fixed at 0.96s. Velocity fields were acquired
using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) for a region of interest (ROI)
located downstream of the constriction. The flow is composed of a central jet
and a recirculation region near the wall where vortex forms and sheds. To study
the mixing processes, finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) fields and
concentration maps were computed. Two lagrangian coherent structures (LCS)
responsible for mixing and transporting fluid were found from FTLE ridges. A
first LCS delimits the trailing edge of the vortex, separating the flow that
enters the ROI between successive periods. A second LCS delimits the leading
edge of the vortex. This LCS concentrates the highest particle agglomeration,
as verified by the concentration maps. Moreover, from the particle residence
time maps (RT) the probability for a fluid particle of leaving the ROI before
one cycle was measured. As $Re$ increases, the probability of leaving the ROI
increases from 0.6 to 0.95. Final position maps $r{_f}$ were introduced to
evaluate the flow mixing between different subregions of the ROI. These maps
allowed us to compute an exchange index between subregions,
$\bar{\mathrm{EI}}$, which shows the main region responsible for the mixing
increase with $Re$. Finally by integrating the results of the different
lagrangian methods (FTLE, Concentration maps, RT and $r_f$ maps), a

disposal of food and agricultural waste (biowaste) such as landfills because
its larvae are able to quickly transform biowaste into ready-to-use biomass.
However, several challenges remain to ensure that BSF farming is economically
viable at different scales and can be widely implemented. Manual labor is
required to ensure optimal conditions to rear the larvae, from aerating the
feeding substrate to monitoring abiotic conditions during the growth cycle.
This paper introduces a proof-of-concept automated method of rearing BSF larvae
to ensure optimal growing conditions while at the same time reducing manual
labor. We retrofit existing BSF rearing bins with a ""smart lid,"" named as such
due to the hot-swappable nature of the lid with multiple bins. The system
automatically aerates the larvae-diet substrate and provides bio-information of
the larvae to users in real time. The proposed solution uses a custom aeration

larvae is monitored using thermal imaging and classical computer vision
techniques. Experimental testing reveals that our automated approach produces

intrinsic charm, was predicted in the early 1980s. Recent results have provided
new evidence for its existence but further confirmation is needed. Purpose:
$J/\psi$ and $\bar D$ meson production are calculated with a combination of
perturbative QCD and intrinsic charm to determine the best energy range to
study intrinsic charm production. Methods: $J/\psi$ and $\bar D$ meson
production are calculated in perturbative QCD to next-to-leading order in the
cross section. Cold nuclear matter effects, including nuclear modification of
the parton densities and $p_T$ broadening by multiple scattering are taken into
account in the production of both; absorption by nucleons is also included for
the $J/\psi$. Contributions from intrinsic charm are calculated assuming
production from a $|uud c \bar c \rangle$ Fock state. Results: The $J/\psi$ and
$\bar D$ meson rapidity and $p_T$ distributions are calculated as a function of
rapidity and transverse momentum $p_T$ over a wide range of center-of-mass
energies with and without intrinsic charm in $p+p$ collisions. The nuclear
modification factor, $R_{pA}$, is also calculated for $p+{\rm Pb}$ interactions
at appropriate energies. Previous fixed-target data as a function of Feynman
$x$, $x_F$, are also compared to calculations within the approach. Good
agreement with the data is found when intrinsic charm is included. Conclusions:
The intrinsic charm signal may be largest at midrapidity for future low energy
fixed target experiments such as the proposed NA60+.

high-performance approaches. In this work, we present a novel
distributed-memory algorithm that, from a string graph representation of the
genome and using sparse matrices, generates the contig set, i.e., overlapping
sequences that form a map representing a region of a chromosome. Using matrix
abstraction, we mask branches in the string graph and compute the connected
component to group genomic sequences that belong to the same linear chain
(i.e., contig). Then, we perform multiway number partitioning to minimize the
load imbalance in local assembly, i.e., concatenation of sequences from a given
contig. Based on the assignment obtained by partitioning, we compute the induce
subgraph function to redistribute sequences between processes, resulting in a
set of local sparse matrices. Finally, we traverse each matrix using
depth-first search to concatenate sequences. Our algorithm shows good scaling
with parallel efficiency up to 80% on 128 nodes, resulting in uniform genome
coverage and showing promising results in terms of assembly quality. Our contig
generation algorithm localizes the assembly process to significantly reduce the
amount of computation spent on this step. Our work is a step forward for
efficient de novo long read assembly of large genomes in a distributed memory.

is able to enumerate all possible alignments satisfying the bounds that can be
grown from each seed, within a specified CPU time or number of generated

potential applications outside bioinformatics, here we focus on the alignment
of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks. We show that BLANT is capable of
finding large, high-quality local alignments when the networks are known to
have high topological similarity -- for example recovering hundreds of
orthologs between networks of the recent Integrated Interaction Database (IID).
Predictably, however, it performs less well when true topological similarity is

thanks to ambipolar diffusion. We investigate whether the drag instability in
1D isothermal C-shocks, inferred from the local linear theory of Gu & Chen, can
appear in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Two C-shock models (with
narrow and broad steady-state shock widths) are considered to represent the
typical environment of star-forming clouds. The ionization-recombination
equilibrium is adopted for the one-fluid approach. In the 1D simulation, the
inflow gas is continuously perturbed by a sinusoidal density fluctuation with a
constant frequency. The perturbations clearly grow after entering the C-shock
region until they start being damped at the transition to the postshock region.
We show that the profiles of a predominant Fourier mode extracted locally from
the simulated growing perturbation match those of the growing mode derived from
the linear analysis. Moreover, the local growth rate and wave frequency derived
from the predominant mode generally agree with those from the linear theory.
Therefore, we confirm the presence of the drag instability in simulated 1D
isothermal C-shocks. We also explore the nonlinear behavior of the instability
by imposing larger-amplitude perturbations to the simulation. We find that the
drag instability is subject to wave steepening, leading to saturated
perturbation growth. Issues concerning local analysis, nonlinear effects,
one-fluid approach, and astrophysical applications are discussed.

In conventional methods, a strongly supervised scheme is applied to sound event
detection in MTL models, which requires strong labels of sound events in model
training; however, annotating strong event labels is quite time-consuming. In
this paper, we thus propose a method for the joint analysis of acoustic scenes

In particular, in the proposed method, we introduce the multiple-instance

evaluate four pooling functions, namely, max pooling, average pooling,
exponential softmax pooling, and attention pooling. Experimental results
obtained using parts of the TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 and TUT Sound Events

learning (more specifically, a distance metric learning) algorithm. In
addition, this framework proposes a novel metric to evaluate similarities, and
analyses other metrics which further demonstrate that RF outperforms all other

  Design",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online marketplaces use rating systems to promote discovery of high quality
products. However, these systems also lead to high variance in producers'
economic outcomes: a new producer who sells high-quality items, may, by luck,
receive one low rating early on, negatively impacting their popularity with
future customers. We investigate the design of rating systems that balance the
goals of identifying high quality products (""efficiency"") and minimizing the
variance in economic outcomes of producers of similar quality (individual
""producer fairness"").
  We observe that there is a trade-off between these two goals: rating systems
that promote efficiency are necessarily less individually fair to producers. We
introduce Bayesian rating systems as an approach to managing this trade-off.
Informally, the systems we propose set a system-wide prior for the quality of
an incoming product, and subsequently the system updates that prior to a
Bayesian posterior on quality based on user-generated ratings over time.
Through calibrated simulations, we show that the strength of the prior directly
determines the operating point on the identified trade-off: the stronger the
prior, the more the marketplace discounts early ratings data (so individual
producer fairness increases), but the slower the platform is in learning about
true item quality (so efficiency suffers). Importantly, the prevailing method
of ratings aggregation -- displaying the sample mean of ratings -- is an
extreme point in this design space, that maximally prioritizes efficiency at
the expense of producer fairness. Instead, by choosing a Bayesian rating system
design with an appropriately set prior, a platform can be intentional about the
consequential choice of a balance between efficiency and producer fairness.

central themes for recent two decades, suggesting that the Anderson insulating
phase turns into a novel insulating state referred to as many body localization
(MBL). However, the role of spin degrees of freedom in this dynamical phase
transition still remains unclarified as a function of the interaction strength.
In this study, we perform real-space spin-resolved Hartree-Fock-Anderson
simulations to investigate metal-insulator transitions above a critical
disorder strength in three spatial dimensions, where all single-particle states
are Anderson-localized without interactions. Here, relatively weak correlations
below the Mott regime are taken into account in the mean-field fashion but
disorder effects are introduced essentially exactly. We find two types of
single-particle mobility edges, where the multifractal spectrum of the
interaction-driven low-energy mobility edge deviates from that of the
high-energy one smoothly connected with the multifractal spectrum of the
metal-insulator transition without interactions. We show that the weakly
interacting insulating phase remains to be a paramagnetic Anderson insulating
state up to the temperature of the order of the band width. On the other hand,
we uncover that the relatively strongly interacting insulating phase still
below the Mott regime is ferromagnetic, which turns into a ferromagnetic
metallic state at a critical temperature much lower than the order of the
bandwidth. Based on all these results, we propose a quantum phase transition
from a paramagnetic Anderson insulating state to a ferromagnetic MBL insulating
phase via an intermediate ferromagnetic metallic state, which intervenes
between these two insulators at the Fermi energy.

groups, the type I errors for the asymptotic score method were shown to be
higher than the nominal level in a systematic pattern over a range of the true
proportions, but the ELS method did not suffer from such a problem. On average,
the true type I error of the ELS method was closer to the nominal level than
all considered methods in the empirical comparisons. Also, in rare cases, the
type I errors of the ELS test exceeded the nominal level, but only by a small
amount. In addition, the p-value and confidence interval using the ELS method
can be obtained in less than 30 seconds of computer time for most confirmatory

thrust vectoring control for trajectory tracking of the payload. The
theoretical analysis on tracking control laws shows that control law is
exponentially stable, thus guaranteeing safe transportation along the desired
trajectory. To validate the performance of the proposed control law, the
results for a numerical simulation as well as a high-fidelity Gazebo real-time

important category of bosonic codes called the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP)
code has aroused much interest recently. Theoretically, the error correction
ability of GKP code is limited since it can only correct small shift errors in
position and momentum quadratures. A natural approach to promote the GKP error
correction for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation is concatenating
encoded GKP states with a stabilizer code. The performance of the XZZX
surface-GKP code, i.e., the single-mode GKP code concatenated with the XZZX
surface code is investigated in this paper under two different noise models.
Firstly, in the code-capacity noise model, the asymmetric rectangular GKP code
with parameter $\lambda$ is introduced. Using the minimum weight perfect
matching decoder combined with the continuous-variable GKP information, the
optimal threshold of the XZZX-surface GKP code reaches $\sigma\approx0.67$ when
$\lambda=2.1$, compared with the threshold $\sigma\approx0.60$ of the standard
surface-GKP code. Secondly, we analyze the shift errors of two-qubit gates in
the actual implementation and build the full circuit-level noise model. By
setting the appropriate bias parameters, the logical error rate is reduced by
several times in some cases. These results indicate the XZZX surface-GKP codes
are more suitable for asymmetric concatenation under the general noise models.
We also estimate the overhead of the XZZX-surface GKP code which uses about 291
GKP states with the noise parameter 18.5 dB ($\kappa/g \approx 0.71\%$) to
encode a logical qubit with the error rate $2.53\times10^{-7}$, compared with
the qubit-based surface code using 3041 qubits to achieve almost the same
logical error rate.

a control from a high-level controller is designed while considering two
important performance metrics ""sparsity"" and ""safety"", which are to reduce the
information exchange between controllers and ensure that the frequency keeps in
safety regions during the whole operation process. Our proposed control design
framework allows the sparse linear feedback controller (SLFC) to be unified
with a family of conditions for safe control using control barrier functions. A
quadratic programming (QP) problem is then constructed, and the real-time
control policy is obtained by solving the QP problem. Importantly, we also

controllers from SLFC and the one determined by the power flow network.
Furthermore, our approach has been validated through extensive numerical

are so large that three or more mesons may be produced when the charmonia
collide with light mesons in hadronic matter. We study the meson-charmonium
collision in a mechanism where the collision produces two quarks and two
antiquarks, the charm quark then fragmenting into charmed mesons, and the other
three constituents as well as quarks and antiquarks created from vacuum give
rise to two or more mesons. The absolute square of the transition amplitude for
the production of two quarks and two antiquarks is derived from the $S$-matrix
element, and cross-section formulas are derived from the absolute square of the
transition amplitude and charm-quark fragmentation functions. With a
temperature-dependent quark potential, we calculate unpolarized cross sections
for inclusive $D^+$, $D^0$, $D^+_s$, or $D^{*+}$ production in scattering of
charmonia by $\pi$, $\rho$, $K$, or $K^\ast$ mesons. At low center-of-mass
energies of the charmonium and the light meson, the cross sections are very
small. At high energies the cross sections have obvious temperature dependence,
and are comparable to peak cross sections of two-to-two meson-charmonium

truly thermodynamic in nature. More generally, surfaces which are not horizons
have also been conjectured to behave thermodynamically. Initially, for surfaces
microscopically expanded from a horizon to so-called stretched horizons, and
more recently, for more general ordinary surfaces in the emergent gravity
program. To test these conjectures we ask whether such surfaces satisfy an
analogue to the first law of thermodynamics (as do horizons). For static
asymptotically-flat spacetimes we find that such a first law holds on horizons.
We rigorously prove that this law remains an excellent approximation for
stretched horizons, but perhaps counter-intuitively this result illustrates the
insufficiency of the laws of black hole mechanics alone from implying truly
thermodynamic behavior. For surfaces away from horizons in the emergent gravity
program the first law fails (with the exception of fully spherically symmetric
scenarios) thus undermining the key thermodynamic assumption of this program.

  Pathology Localization in Chest X-Rays",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Before the recent success of deep learning methods for automated medical
image analysis, practitioners used handcrafted radiomic features to
quantitatively describe local patches of medical images. However, extracting
discriminative radiomic features relies on accurate pathology localization,
which is difficult to acquire in real-world settings. Despite advances in
disease classification and localization from chest X-rays, many approaches fail
to incorporate clinically-informed domain knowledge. For these reasons, we
propose a Radiomics-Guided Transformer (RGT) that fuses \textit{global} image
information with \textit{local} knowledge-guided radiomics information to
provide accurate cardiopulmonary pathology localization and classification
\textit{without any bounding box annotations}. RGT consists of an image
Transformer branch, a radiomics Transformer branch, and fusion layers that
aggregate image and radiomic information. Using the learned self-attention of
its image branch, RGT extracts a bounding box for which to compute radiomic
features, which are further processed by the radiomics branch; learned image
and radiomic features are then fused and mutually interact via cross-attention
layers. Thus, RGT utilizes a novel end-to-end feedback loop that can bootstrap
accurate pathology localization only using image-level disease labels.
Experiments on the NIH ChestXRay dataset demonstrate that RGT outperforms prior
works in weakly supervised disease localization (by an average margin of 3.6\%
over various intersection-over-union thresholds) and classification (by 1.1\%
in average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). We publicly

segmentation algorithms through multi-modality data fusion. However,
fusion-based approaches require paired data, i.e., LiDAR point clouds and
camera images with strict point-to-pixel mappings, as the inputs in both

scenarios. Thus, in this work, we propose the 2D Priors Assisted Semantic
Segmentation (2DPASS), a general training scheme, to boost the representation
learning on point clouds, by fully taking advantage of 2D images with rich
appearance. In practice, by leveraging an auxiliary modal fusion and
multi-scale fusion-to-single knowledge distillation (MSFSKD), 2DPASS acquires
richer semantic and structural information from the multi-modal data, which are
then online distilled to the pure 3D network. As a result, equipped with
2DPASS, our baseline shows significant improvement with only point cloud
inputs. Specifically, it achieves the state-of-the-arts on two large-scale
benchmarks (i.e. SemanticKITTI and NuScenes), including top-1 results in both

al., 1967) by multiplying the velocity input with the coefficient CFL < 1.0 to
overcome the stability problem and divide the output velocity data by the same
CFL. The initial velocity field is chosen as u(x; 0) = 0 and the force is
injected at low wave-numbers with a fixed forcing amplitude to 10^-4 for all
cases. The single relaxation time is set to 0.503 in all SRT simulations.
Results show that the obtained turbulent velocity fields yield universal
characteristics as proven in previous theoretical, experimental and numerical
studies. The Taylor Reynolds number for the simulations are found as SRT: R =
62 and MRT : R = 65 for 1283 and SRT: R= 107 and MRT: R = 82 for the case of

inhomogeneity. We observe spin fluctuations to slow down at temperatures T near
the onset of static charge order and, overall, the effect of the field B may be
seen as equivalent to strengthening stripe order by approaching p=0.12 doping.
In details however, our analysis reveals significant departure from usual
field-induced magnetic transitions. The continuous growth of the amplitude of
the fluctuating moment with increasing B suggests a nearly-critical state in
the B->0 limit, with very weak quasi-static moments possibly confined in small
areas like vortex cores. Further, the nucleation of spin order in the vortex
cores is shown to account quantitatively for both the value and the p
dependence of a field scale characterizing bulk spin freezing. The correlation
time of the fluctuating moment appears to depend exponentially on B/T (over the
investigated range). This explains the timescale dependence of various
experimental manifestations, including why, for transport measurements, the AFM
moments may be considered static over a considerable range of B and T. These
results make the high-field magnetic ground state up to p* an integral part of

4$, the group $\rm SL_n (\mathbb{R})$ and all its lattices have the Banach
fixed point property with respect to all super-reflexive Banach spaces. Second,
we settle a long standing open problem and show that the Margulis expanders
(Cayley graphs of $\rm SL_{n} (\mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z} )$ for a fixed $n \geq
3$ and $m$ tending to infinity) are super-expanders.
  All of our results stem from proving Banach property (T) for $\rm SL_3
(\mathbb{Z})$. Our method of proof for $\rm SL_3 (\mathbb{Z})$ relies on a
novel proof for relative Banach property (T) for the uni-triangular subgroup of
$\rm SL_3 (\mathbb{Z})$. This proof of relative property (T) is new even in the
classical Hilbert setting and is interesting in its own right.

both Eulerian perturbation theory (EPT) and Lagrangian perturbation theory,
generalizing the canonical EdS expressions to a one-parameter family where the
parameter can be taken to be the exponent $\alpha$ of the growing mode linear
amplification $D(a) \propto a^{\alpha}$. For the power spectrum (PS) at one
loop in EPT, the contribution additional to standard EdS is given, for each of
the `13' and `22' terms, as a function of two infra-red safe integrals. In the
second part of the paper we show that the calculation of cosmology-dependent
corrections in perturbation theory in standard (e.g. LCDM-like) models can be
simplified, and their magnitude and parameter dependence better understood, by
relating them to our analytic results for gEdS models. At second order the time
dependent kernels are equivalent to the analytic kernels of the gEdS model with
$\alpha$ replaced by a single redshift dependent effective growth rate
$\alpha_2(z)$. At third order the time evolution can be conveniently
parametrized in terms of two additional such effective growth rates. For the PS
calculated at one loop order, the correction to the PS relative to the EdS
limit can be expressed in terms of just $\alpha_2(z)$, one additional effective
growth rate function and the four infra-red safe integrals of the gEdS limit.
This is much simplified compared to expressions in the literature that use six
or eight red-shift dependent functions and are not explicitly infra-red safe.
Using the analytic gEdS expression for the PS with $\alpha=\alpha_2(z)$ gives a
good approximation (to $\sim 25 \%$) for the exact result.

learning via a single-directional knowledge transfer from label-rich source
domain to unlabeled target domain, while its reverse adaption from target to
source has not jointly been considered yet so far. In fact, in some real
teaching practice, a teacher helps students learn while also gets promotion
from students to some extent, which inspires us to explore a dual-directional
knowledge transfer between domains, and thus propose a Dual-Correction
Adaptation Network (DualCAN) in this paper. However, due to the asymmetrical
label knowledge across domains, transfer from unlabeled target to labeled
source poses a more difficult challenge than the common source-to-target
counterpart. First, the target pseudo-labels predicted by source commonly
involve noises due to model bias, hence in the reverse adaptation, they may
hurt the source performance and bring a negative target-to-source transfer.
Secondly, source domain usually contains innate noises, which will inevitably
aggravate the target noises, leading to noise amplification across domains. To
this end, we further introduce a Noise Identification and Correction (NIC)
module to correct and recycle noises in both domains. To our best knowledge,
this is the first naive attempt of dual-directional adaptation for noisy UDA,
and naturally applicable to noise-free UDA. A theory justification is given to
state the rationality of our intuition. Empirical results confirm the
effectiveness of DualCAN with remarkable performance gains over
state-of-the-arts, particularly for extreme noisy tasks (e.g., ~+ 15% on Pw->Pr

out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient $d_{31}$ is -1.58 pm/V, which is
higher than ones of most 2D materials (compare absolute values of $d_{31}$).
The large out-of-plane piezoelectricity is robust against electronic

Calculated results show that tensile strain is conducive to high Curie
temperature, large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and large $d_{31}$.
Finally, by comparing $d_{31}$ of CrYX (Y=S; X=Cl, Br I) and CrYX (Y=O; X=F,

  Integral","31 pages",,,,"math.CA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Various kinds of Stieltjes integrals using gauge integration have become
highly popular in the field of differential equations and other applications.
In the theories of integration and of ordinary differential equations,
convergence theorems provide one of the most widely used tools. The Harnack
extension principle, which discusses a sufficient condition for
Kurzweil-Henstock integrable functions on particular subsets of $(a,b)$ to be
integrable on $[a,b]$, is a key step to supply convergence theorems. The
Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral reduces to the Kurzweil-Henstock integral whenever
the integrator is an identity function. In general, if the integrator $F$ is
discontinuous on $[c,d]\subset[a,b]$, then the values of the Kurzweil-Stieltjes
integrals $$\int_c^d[dF]g,\ \int_{[c,d]}[dF]g,\ \int_{[c,d)}[dF]g,\
\int_{(c,d]}[dF]g,\ {\rm and}\ \int_{(c,d)}[dF]g$$ need not coincide. Hence,
the Harnack extension principle in the Kurzweil-Henstock integral cannot be
valid any longer for the Kurzweil-type Stieltjes integrals with discontinuous
integrators. The new concepts of equi-integrability and equiregulatedness are
pivotal to the notion of the Harnack extension principle for the
Kurzweil-Stieltjes integration.
  Moreover, the existence of the integral $\int_a^b[dF]g$ does not (even in the
case of the identity integrator) always imply the existence of the integral
$\int_{T}[dF]g$ for every subset $T$ of $[a,b]$. This follows from the
well-known fact that, if e.g., $T\subset[a,b]$ is not measurable, then the
existence of the Lebesgue integral $\int_a^b g [dt]$ does not imply that the
integral $\int_T g [dt]$ exists. Therefore, besides constructing the Harnack
extension principle for the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral, the aim of
this paper is also to demonstrate its role in guaranteeing the existence of the

  two Egyptian pyramid volume formulas (1850 BCE). Thoughts on the border
  between history and didactics of mathematics",,,,,"math.HO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Egyptologists and historians of mathematics around 1930 did an admirable job
in showing that problem 14 of the newly discovered Moscow Papyrus from around
1850 BCE amounts to a general and exact calculation of the volume of a
truncated pyramid (frustum). They were less successful in giving tentative
explanations of what convinced the Egyptians of its correctness. In particular,
they never looked into the possibility of dissecting three identical copies of
the frustum and recomposing them into three boxes of differing sizes whose
volumes can be easily calculated. This is surprising because the formula at
which the historians arrived seems to suggest this procedure. About 2000 years
after the Egyptians, the Chinese scholar Liu Hui did exactly this for the
almost identical problem from the Nine Chapters. If those historians of
mathematics around 1930 had known Liu Hui's algorithm they could have easily
drawn tentative conclusions also for the Egyptian case. The present paper
suggests that it was their knowledge of rigorous Euclidean geometry and of
relatively modern algebra which distorted the judgment of those historians,
something which could not have been the case for Liu Hui. Their failure seems
to have discouraged later Egyptologists to look for explanations or to even
point to Liu Hui when his work had become known. Thus a chance was missed to
use the great intuitive and pedagogic potential of a remarkable piece of
Egyptian mathematics. This paper is not a contribution to the historiography of
Egyptian mathematics for which the author is no specialist but argues primarily
on a methodological level using secondary historical sources. The paper is
partly inspired by a more recent publication of Paul Shutler (2009) who
suggests an intuitive and historically possible proof also for the special, and
mathematically crucial case of the second formula, which is related to the full
pyramid.

attention. Unlike traditional biometric features, physiological signals can not
be easily compromised (usually unobservable to human eyes).
Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal is easy to measure, making it more attractive
than many other physiological signals for biometric authentication. However,
with the advent of remote PPG (rPPG), unobservability has been challenged when
the attacker can remotely steal the rPPG signals by monitoring the victim's
face, subsequently posing a threat to PPG-based biometrics. In PPG-based
biometric authentication, current attack approaches mandate the victim's PPG
signal, making rPPG-based attacks neglected. In this paper, we firstly analyze
the security of PPG-based biometrics, including user authentication and
communication protocols. We evaluate the signal waveforms, heart rate and
inter-pulse-interval information extracted by five rPPG methods, including four
traditional optical computing methods (CHROM, POS, LGI, PCA) and one deep
learning method (CL_rPPG). We conducted experiments on five datasets (PURE,
UBFC_rPPG, UBFC_Phys, LGI_PPGI, and COHFACE) to collect a comprehensive set of
results. Our empirical studies show that rPPG poses a serious threat to the
authentication system. The success rate of the rPPG signal spoofing attack in
the user authentication system reached 0.35. The bit hit rate is 0.6 in
inter-pulse-interval-based security protocols. Further, we propose an active
defence strategy to hide the physiological signals of the face to resist the
attack. It reduces the success rate of rPPG spoofing attacks in user
authentication to 0.05. The bit hit rate was reduced to 0.5, which is at the
level of a random guess. Our strategy effectively prevents the exposure of PPG
signals to protect users' sensitive physiological data.

sheds light on the quantum (or non-classical) nature of gravity. By comparing

gravity theories of classical or quantum origins can be distinguished by
comparing their different impacts on decoherence rate of $\zeta$. Our

non-commutativity with respect to successive partial-derivative operations, the
non-Abelian Bianchi identity is violated. The violation as an operator is shown
to be equivalent to violation of Abelian-like Bianchi identities. Then there
appear eight Abelian-like conserved magnetic monopole currents of the Dirac
type in $SU(3)$ QCD. Exact Abelian (but kinematical) symmetries appear in
non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. Here we try to show the Abelian dual Meissner effect
due to the above Abelian-like monopoles are responsible for color confinement
in $SU(3)$ QCD. If this picture is correct, the string tension of non-Abelian
Wilson loops is reproduced fully by that of the Abelian Wilson loops. This is
called as perfect Abelian dominance. In this report, the perfect Abelian
dominance is shown to exist with the help of the multilevel method but without
introducing additional smoothing techniques like partial gauge fixings,
although lattice sizes studied are not large enough to study the infinite
volume limit. Perfect monopole dominance is also shown without any additional
gauge fixing. Abelian electric fields are squeezed due to solenoidal monopole
currents and the penetration length for an Abelian electric field of a single
color is the same as that of non-Abelian electric field. The coherence length
is also measured directly through the correlation of the monopole density and
the Polyakov loop pair. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter indicates that the vacuum
type is the weak type I (dual) superconductor. The results obtained above
without any additional assumptions as well as more clear previous $SU(2)$
results seem to suggest strongly the above Abelian dual Meissner picture of
color confinement mechanism.

vastly superior performance to the currently available approaches. The

deep-learning-based digital in-line holography techniques. We found that the
droplet exhibits vibrational, retracting bag and normal breakup phenomena for
the no swirl, low and high swirl strengths for the same aerodynamic field. In
the high swirl scenario, the disintegrations of the nodes, rim, and bag-film
contribute to the number mean diameter, resulting in smaller satellite
droplets. In contrast, in the low swirl case, the breakup of the rim and nodes
only contributes to the size distribution, resulting in larger droplets. The
temporal variation of the Sauter mean diameter reveals that for a given
aerodynamic force, a high swirl strength produces more surface area and surface
energy than a low swirl strength. The theoretical prediction of the number-mean
probability density of tiny satellite droplets under swirl conditions agrees
with experimental data. However, for the low swirl, the predictions differ from
the experimental results, particularly due to the presence of large satellite
droplets. Our results reveal that the volume-weighted droplet size distribution
exhibits two (bi-modal) and three (multi-model) peaks for low and high swirl
strengths, respectively. The analytical model that takes into account various

  Framework for Monocular 3D Object Detection","11 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monocular 3D object detection is an essential perception task for autonomous
driving. However, the high reliance on large-scale labeled data make it costly
and time-consuming during model optimization. To reduce such over-reliance on
human annotations, we propose Mix-Teaching, an effective semi-supervised
learning framework applicable to employ both labeled and unlabeled images in
training stage. Mix-Teaching first generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled images
by self-training. The student model is then trained on the mixed images
possessing much more intensive and precise labeling by merging instance-level
image patches into empty backgrounds or labeled images. This is the first to
break the image-level limitation and put high-quality pseudo labels from multi
frames into one image for semi-supervised training. Besides, as a result of the
misalignment between confidence score and localization quality, it's hard to
discriminate high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions using only
confidence-based criterion. To that end, we further introduce an
uncertainty-based filter to help select reliable pseudo boxes for the above
mixing operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified SSL
framework for monocular 3D object detection. Mix-Teaching consistently improves
MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios on
KITTI dataset. For example, our method achieves around +6.34% AP@0.7
improvement against the GUPNet baseline on validation set when using only 10%
labeled data. Besides, by leveraging full training set and the additional 48K
raw images of KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% improvement
on AP@0.7 for car detection, reaching 18.54% AP@0.7, which ranks the 1st place
among all monocular based methods on KITTI test leaderboard. The code and
pretrained models will be released at

the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanostructures. The
reproduction fidelity of the designed micro- and nanostructures is influenced
by experimental writing conditions, including laser power, exposure time, etc.
To determine the appropriate writing parameters, characterization of
morphological features and surface roughness during the experiment is needed.
Traditional characterization methods for TPP, e.g., scanning electron
microscopy and atomic force microscopy, have limited speed and cannot study
internal structures without invasive approaches. Optical diffraction tomography
(ODT) is an emerging label-free 3D imaging technique based on reconstructing
the object's 3D refractive index (RI) distribution with diffraction-limited
resolution. Here, we propose a non-invasive solution to fully characterize the
TPP-fabricated structures using a high-speed ODT technique, which can eliminate
the need for complex sample preparation, such as fluorescence labelling or
metal-coating, and achieve a full 3D measurement time of 6 ms. By visualizing
and studying different TPP-fabricated structures, including embedded spirals
and cubes, via the ODT system, the fabrication quality, including 3D
morphological features, exposure levels, and surface roughness, can be examined
quantitatively. The results suggest our method can effectively improve the
fabrication quality and reproducibility of TPP, generating impacts on the
nanofabrication community.

this paper introduces NGAME, a light-weight mini-batch creation technique that
offers provably accurate in-batch negative samples. This allows training with
larger mini-batches offering significantly faster convergence and higher

addressing the specific challenges such as range limitations and the
possibility of battery recharge at predefined charging locations. We pose the
dynamic equilibrium problem within the deterministic queueing model of Vickrey
and as our main result, we establish the existence of an energy-feasible
dynamic equilibrium. There are three key modeling-ingredients for obtaining
this existence result:
  * We introduce a walk-based definition of dynamic traffic flows which allows
for cyclic routing behavior as a result of recharging events en route.
  * We use abstract convex feasibility sets in an appropriate function space to
model the energy-feasibility of used walks.
  * We introduce the concept of capacitated dynamic equilibrium walk-flows
which generalize the former unrestricted dynamic equilibrium path-flows.
  Viewed in this framework, we show the existence of an energy-feasible dynamic
equilibrium by applying an infinite dimensional variational inequality, which
in turn requires a careful analysis of continuity properties of the network
loading as a result of injecting flow into walks. We complement our theoretical
results by a computational study in which we design a fixed-point algorithm
computing energy-feasible dynamic equilibria. We apply the algorithm to
standard real-world instances from the traffic assignment community
illustrating the complex interplay of resulting travel times, energy
consumption and prices paid at equilibrium.

challenging in cancer treatment due to the heterogeneity of tumors. Traditional
computational efforts have been made to model the effect of drug response on

because of the high dimension for omics data, hindering models from clinical
application. Recent research shows that deep learning is a promising approach
to build drug response models by learning alignment patterns between drugs and
samples. However, existing studies employed the simple feature fusion strategy
and only considered the drug features as a whole representation while ignoring
the substructure information that may play a vital role when aligning drugs and
genes. Hereby in this paper, we propose TCR (Transformer based network for
Cancer drug Response) to predict anti-cancer drug response. By utilizing an
attention mechanism, TCR is able to learn the interactions between drug
atom/sub-structure and molecular signatures efficiently in our study.
Furthermore, a dual loss function and cross sampling strategy were designed to
improve the prediction power of TCR. We show that TCR outperformed all other
methods under various data splitting strategies on all evaluation matrices
(some with significant improvement). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCR
shows significantly improved generalization ability on independent in-vitro
experiments and in-vivo real patient data. Our study highlights the prediction
power of TCR and its potential value for cancer drug repurpose and precision

linearly stable stars with a nontrivial scalar profile without instabilities
puts an upper bound on the strength of the dimensionless coupling constant
$|\alpha|$. To realize maximum masses of NSs for a linear (or dilatonic) GB
coupling $\alpha_{\rm GB}\phi R_{\rm GB}^2$ with typical nuclear equations of

multiple classes of jobs on different items. A useful and tractable way to find
an optimal control for such a network is to approximate it by a fluid model,

arrival and service rates in such systems suffer from inherent uncertainty. A
recent study addressed this issue by formulating a Robust Counterpart for SCLP
models with budgeted uncertainty which provides a solution in terms of

However, in cases where servers can process several jobs simultaneously, a
sequencing policy cannot be implemented. In this paper, we propose to use in
these cases a a resource allocation policy, namely, the proportion of server
effort per class. We formulate Robust Counterparts of both processing rates and
server-effort uncertain models for four types of uncertainty sets: box,
budgeted, one-sided budgeted, and polyhedral. We prove that server-effort model
provides a better robust solution than any algebraic transformation of the

we introduce a sliding structure based on the banded approximation of the

different-length signals without changing the network structure. Furthermore,
we apply the measured at-sea doubly-selective UWA channel and offshore
background noise to evaluate the proposed equalizer. Experimental results show
that the proposed UDNet performs better with low computational complexity.
Concretely, the SER of UDNet is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of

interceptions by the Libyan Coast Guard starting in 2017 and the corresponding
decrease in the probability of rescue at sea. We find support for a deterrence
effect in which attempted crossings along the Central Mediterranean route
declined, and a diversion effect in which some migrants substituted to the
Western Mediterranean route. At the same time, smugglers adapted their tactics.

smugglers trade off between the short-run payoffs to launching overcrowded
boats and the long-run costs of making less successful crossing attempts under
different levels of enforcement. Taken together, these analyses shed light on
how the integration of incident- and flow-level datasets can inform ongoing

equivalently, 1-homogeneous functions on a certain GL(1,R)-principal bundle
P\to M which is equipped with a homogeneous symplectic form \omega. In other
words, our understanding of contact geometry is that it is not an
`odd-dimensional cousin' of symplectic geometry but rather a part of the
latter, namely `homogeneous symplectic geometry'. This understanding of contact
structures is much simpler than the traditional one and very effective in
applications, reducing the contact Hamiltonian formalism to the standard
symplectic picture. We develop in this language contact Hamiltonian mechanics
in autonomous, as well as time-dependent case, and the corresponding
Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Fundamental examples are based on canonical contact
structures on the first jet bundles J^1(L) of sections of line bundles L, which

At the heart of that revolution is automatic differentiation, which calculates
the derivative of a performance measure relative to a large number of
parameters. Differentiation enhances the discovery of improved performance in
large models, an achievement that was previously difficult or impossible.
Recently, a second computational advance optimizes the temporal trajectories
traced by differential equations. Optimization requires differentiating a
measure of performance over a trajectory, such as the closeness of tracking the
environment, with respect to the parameters of the differential equations.
Because model trajectories are usually calculated numerically by multistep
algorithms, such as Runge-Kutta, the automatic differentiation must be passed
through the numerical algorithm. This article explains how such automatic
differentiation of trajectories is achieved. It also discusses why such
computational breakthroughs are likely to advance theoretical and statistical
studies of biological problems, in which one can consider variables as dynamic
paths over time and space. Many common problems arise between improving success
in computational learning models over performance landscapes, improving
evolutionary fitness over adaptive landscapes, and improving statistical fits

ground-state quantum phase transition (QPT) and an excited-state quantum phase

gives rise to a second ESQPT that alters the static properties of the model
[Phys. Rev. E 106, 044125 (2022)]. In the present work, the dynamical
implications associated to this new ESQPT are analyzed. For that purpose, a
quantum quench protocol is defined on the system Hamiltonian that takes an
initial state, usually the ground state, into a complex excited state that
evolves on time. The impact of the new ESQPT on the time evolution of the
survival probability and the local density of states after the quantum quench,
as well as on the Loschmidt echoes and the microcanonical out-of-time-order
correlator (OTOC) are discussed. The anharmonity-induced ESQPT, despite having
a different physical origin, has dynamical consequences similar to those
observed in the ESQPT already present in the standard LMG model.

  Cardiogram","13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Impedance Cardiogram (ICG) has impressive number of applications
in healthcare. However, its wider adoption is excessively limited due to the
well recognized challenges in ICG delineation. We present a simple, adaptive,
and efficient method for the most demanding ICG delineation task - detection of
less distinct B-point that marks the onset of the left ventricular ejection.
Method: The core of the new method is transformation of ICG time series by
weighted time window of an ICG segment preceding the maximal ICG peak (the
C-point) aiming at the B-point enhancement. The resulting Modified B-point
(MB-point) is then easily delineated. To evaluate the proposed workflow, the
dataset comprising 20 healthy participants and 21065 B-points are manually
annotated and openly shared with the software code. To the best of our
knowledge, our ICG dataset has the largest number of annotated B-points.
Detector performance is evaluated on two recorded segments with distinct
noises, as well as on an open dataset comprising ICG recorded in another set of
24 healthy subjects. Results: The results showed that the method was superior
to the competing methods when the tolerance for B-point detection was set to
+/-150 ms in all cases and for both datasets (>99.4%). Conclusions: Proposed
approach based on the weighted time windows presents a promising technique for
reliable ICG delineation that is instrumental for appropriate feature
extraction and ICG characterization. Further customization could incorporate
labeling of other pathological ICG segments, other biomedical signals, as well
as additional enhancements for improving robustness to noise.

However, these methods built upon detection transformer framework might achieve
sub-optimal training efficiency and performance due to coarse positional query
modeling.In addition, the point label form exploited in previous works implies
the reading order of humans, which impedes the detection robustness from our
observation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a concise Dynamic
Point Text DEtection TRansformer network, termed DPText-DETR. In detail,
DPText-DETR directly leverages explicit point coordinates to generate position
queries and dynamically updates them in a progressive way. Moreover, to improve
the spatial inductive bias of non-local self-attention in Transformer, we
present an Enhanced Factorized Self-Attention module which provides point
queries within each instance with circular shape guidance. Furthermore, we
design a simple yet effective positional label form to tackle the side effect
of the previous form. To further evaluate the impact of different label forms
on the detection robustness in real-world scenario, we establish an
Inverse-Text test set containing 500 manually labeled images. Extensive

  by Classifier Paradox",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) is a general unsupervised domain
adaptation setting, which addresses both domain and label shifts in adaptation.
Its main challenge lies in how to identify target samples in unshared or
unknown classes. Previous methods commonly strive to depict sample ""confidence""
along with a threshold for rejecting unknowns, and align feature distributions
of shared classes across domains. However, it is still hard to pre-specify a
""confidence"" criterion and threshold which are adaptive to various real tasks,
and a mis-prediction of unknowns further incurs misalignment of features in
shared classes. In this paper, we propose a new UniDA method with adaptive
Unknown Authentication by Classifier Paradox (UACP), considering that samples
with paradoxical predictions are probably unknowns belonging to none of the
source classes. In UACP, a composite classifier is jointly designed with two
types of predictors. That is, a multi-class (MC) predictor classifies samples
to one of the multiple source classes, while a binary one-vs-all (OVA)
predictor further verifies the prediction by MC predictor. Samples with
verification failure or paradox are identified as unknowns. Further, instead of
feature alignment for shared classes, implicit domain alignment is conducted in
output space such that samples across domains share the same decision boundary,
though with feature discrepancy. Empirical results validate UACP under both
open-set and universal UDA settings.

existence of a minimal length. To circumvent the seeming contradiction between
the existence of a minimum length and the principle of special relativity,
Double Special Relativity introduces modified dispersion relationships that
reconcile the conflict. In this work, we combine these dispersion relationships
with an effective field theory approach to compute the first post Newtonian
correction to the bending of light by a massive object. The calculation offers
the prospect of a directly measurable effect that rests upon both the existence
of a quantized gravitational field and a minimal length. Experimental

fields, such as transportation system and computer networks. Traffic
forecasting can be highly challenging due to complex spatial-temporal

spatial-temporal dependencies by considering spatial correlations and temporal
correlations separately and fail to model the direct spatial-temporal
correlations. Inspired by the recent success of transformers in the graph
domain, in this paper, we propose to directly model the cross-spatial-temporal
correlations on the spatial-temporal graph using local multi-head
self-attentions. To reduce the time complexity, we set the attention receptive
field to the spatially neighboring nodes, and we also introduce an adaptive
graph to capture the hidden spatial-temporal dependencies. Based on these
attention mechanisms, we propose a novel Adaptive Graph Spatial-Temporal
Transformer Network (ASTTN), which stacks multiple spatial-temporal attention
layers to apply self-attention on the input graph, followed by linear layers
for predictions. Experimental results on public traffic network datasets,
