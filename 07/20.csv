on Szemer\'edi's celebrated Regularity Lemma. This allows us to obtain
non-trivial albeit slight improvements over longstanding bounds for matchings
in streaming and dynamic graphs. In particular, we establish the following
results for $n$-vertex graphs:
  * A deterministic single-pass streaming algorithm that finds
  a $(1-o(1))$-approximate matching in $o(n^2)$ bits of space. This constitutes
the first single-pass algorithm for this problem in sublinear space that
improves over the $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation of the greedy algorithm.
  * A randomized fully dynamic algorithm that with high probability maintains a
$(1-o(1))$-approximate matching in $o(n)$ worst-case update time per each edge
insertion or deletion. The algorithm works even against an adaptive adversary.
This is the first $o(n)$ update-time dynamic algorithm with approximation
guarantee arbitrarily close to one.
  Given the use of regularity lemma, the improvement obtained by our algorithms
over trivial bounds is only by some $(\log^*{n})^{\Theta(1)}$ factor.
Nevertheless, in each case, they show that the ``right'' answer to the problem
is not what is dictated by the previous bounds.
  Finally, in the streaming model, we also present a randomized
$(1-o(1))$-approximation algorithm whose space can be upper bounded by the
density of certain Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi (RS) graphs. While RS graphs by now have
been used extensively to prove streaming lower bounds, ours is the first to use
them as an upper bound tool for designing improved streaming algorithms.

Sudakov-like, logarithms in external-leg corrections of heavy scalars. To the
difference of usual Sudakov logarithms, these can furthermore potentially be
enhanced by large trilinear couplings. Such large logarithms are associated
with infrared singularities and we review several techniques to address these

the two-loop corrections containing this type of large logarithms, pointing out
in this context the importance of adopting an on-shell renormalisation scheme.

of fracture toughness, while often a crack may even be stopped when it impinges
a void, which releases the stress concentration. Therefore, the determination
of crack trajectories is important in the design against failure of materials
and mechanical pieces. The recently developed phase-field approach (AT1 and AT2
models), based on a variational approach to damage localization, is believed to
be particularly suited to describe complex crack trajectories. This belief is
examined through a comparison between simulations and photoelastic experiments
on PMMA plates, which have been designed in a new way, to highlight the effects
of notches and circular holes on fracture propagation. The latter is shown to
initiate from a notch and to be strongly attracted by voids. When a void is
hit, fracture is arrested, unless the void contains a notch on its internal
surface, from which a new crack nucleates and propagates. Different mechanical
models are tested where fracture initiates and grows (i.) under Mode I compact
tension, (ii.) four-point bending and (iii.) a tensile stress indirectly
generated during compression of samples containing a circular hole. The
experiments show that the fracture propagation may be designed to develop in
different tortuous paths, involving multiple arrests and secondary nucleation.
Simulations performed with an ad hoc implemented version of the AT1 and AT2
phase-field methods (equipped with spectral decomposition, in which a crack is
simulated as a highly localized zone of damage accumulation) are shown to be in
close agreement with experiments and therefore confirm the validity of the
approach and its potentialities for mechanical design.

challenges to mitigate the tradeoff between distortion and editability, i.e.
reconstructing the input image accurately and editing the inverted image with a
small visual quality drop. The recently proposed pivotal tuning model makes
significant progress towards reconstruction and editability, by using a
two-step approach that first inverts the input image into a latent code, called
pivot code, and then alters the generator so that the input image can be
accurately mapped into the pivot code. Here, we show that both reconstruction
and editability can be improved by a proper design of the pivot code. We
present a simple yet effective method, named cycle encoding, for a high-quality
pivot code. The key idea of our method is to progressively train an encoder in
varying spaces according to a cycle scheme: W->W+->W. This training methodology
preserves the properties of both W and W+ spaces, i.e. high editability of W
and low distortion of W+. To further decrease the distortion, we also propose
to refine the pivot code with an optimization-based method, where a
regularization term is introduced to reduce the degradation in editability.
Qualitative and quantitative comparisons to several state-of-the-art methods

GFlow fails to be necessary for determinism when a measurement-based quantum

designed more than 15 years ago as a generalisation of GFlow to handle MBQC

polynomial threshold function (PTF) of degree $d$ and weight $W$ if there is a
polynomial $p$ with integer coefficients of degree $d$ and with sum of absolute

study a representation of decision lists as PTFs over Boolean cubes $\{0,1\}^n$
and over Hamming balls $\{0,1\}^{n}_{\leq k}$.
  As our first result, we show that for all $d = O\left( \left( \frac{n}{\log
n}\right)^{1/3}\right)$ any decision list over $\{0,1\}^n$ can be represented
by a PTF of degree $d$ and weight $2^{O(n/d^2)}$. This improves the result by
Klivans and Servedio [Klivans, Servedio, 2006] by a $\log^2 d$ factor in the
exponent of the weight. Our bound is tight for all $d = O\left( \left(
\frac{n}{\log n}\right)^{1/3}\right)$ due to the matching lower bound by Beigel
[Beigel, 1994].
  For decision lists over a Hamming ball $\{0,1\}^n_{\leq k}$ we show that the
upper bound on weight above can be drastically improved to $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$
for $d = \Theta(\sqrt{k})$. We also show that similar improvement is not
possible for smaller degrees by proving the lower bound $W = 2^{\Omega(n/d^2)}$
for all $d = O(\sqrt{k})$. \end{abstract}

information across several computing devices and sharing the same amongst them,
thereby tackling issues of privacy and the need of huge bandwidth. FL
techniques generally use a central server or cloud for aggregating the models
received from the devices. Such centralized FL techniques suffer from inherent
problems such as failure of the central node and bottlenecks in channel
bandwidth. When FL is used in conjunction with connected robots serving as
devices, a failure of the central controlling entity can lead to a chaotic
situation. This paper describes a mobile agent based paradigm to decentralize
FL in multi-robot scenarios. Using Webots, a popular free open-source robot
simulator, and Tartarus, a mobile agent platform, we present a methodology to
decentralize federated learning in a set of connected robots. With Webots
running on different connected computing systems, we show how mobile agents can
perform the task of Decentralized Federated Reinforcement Learning (dFRL).
Results obtained from experiments carried out using Q-learning and SARSA by
aggregating their corresponding Q-tables, show the viability of using
decentralized FL in the domain of robotics. Since the proposed work can be used
in conjunction with other learning algorithms and also real robots, it can act
as a vital tool for the study of decentralized FL using heterogeneous learning
algorithms concurrently in multi-robot scenarios.

widely-used paradigm for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), as they
follow a natural way of reasoning that humans are familiar with. However, all

features or characteristics that are especially important for an AI's decision.
We argue that in order to fully understand a decision, not only knowledge about
relevant features is needed, but that the awareness of irrelevant information
also highly contributes to the creation of a user's mental model of an AI
system. Therefore, we introduce a new way of explaining AI systems. Our
approach, which we call Alterfactual Explanations, is based on showing an
alternative reality where irrelevant features of an AI's input are altered. By
doing so, the user directly sees which characteristics of the input data can
change arbitrarily without influencing the AI's decision. We evaluate our
approach in an extensive user study, revealing that it is able to significantly
contribute to the participants' understanding of an AI. We show that
alterfactual explanations are suited to convey an understanding of different
aspects of the AI's reasoning than established counterfactual explanation

do not deliver accurate information on nuclear axiality the ad-hoc assumption
of symmetry about one axis found widespread use in nuclear model calculations.
In the theoretical interpretation of nuclear properties as well as in the
analysis of experimental data triaxiality was considered - if at all - only for
some, often exotic, nuclides. A breaking of axial symmetry combined to a
spin-independent moment of inertia results in a surprisingly simple heuristic
triaxial parametrization of the yrast sequence in all heavy nuclei, including
well deformed ones. No additional fit parameters are needed in detailed studies
of the mass and charge dependence of the electric dipole strength in the range
of and outside of giant dipole resonances. Allowing triaxiality also avoids the
introduction of an arbitrary level density parameter \=a to fit the accurate
values observed in n-capture experiments and \=a can be taken from nuclear
matter studies. A combination of this value to the yrast energies no longer
based on axiality and the related I(I+1) rule results in agreement to data
independent of spin. And predictions for radiative neutron capture as derived
on the basis of non-axiality are improved as well. The experimentally favoured
broken axial symmetry is in accord to HFB and MC-shell model calculations
already for nuclei in the valley of stability.

suggested the possibility of dual Shapiro steps -- that a Josephson junction
device could produce current steps with heights determined only on the applied
frequency. In this report, we embed an ultrasmall Josephson junction in a high
impedance array of larger junctions to reveal dual Shapiro steps. For multiple
frequencies, we detect that the AC response of the circuit is synchronised with
the microwave tone at frequency $f$, and the corresponding emergence of flat
steps in the DC response with current $2ef$, equal to the tunnelling of a
Cooper pair per tone period. This work sheds new light on phase-charge duality,
omnipresent in condensed matter physics, and extends it to Josephson circuits.

admixture of a small Rydberg fraction to the atomic mirror, and consequently
strong dipolar Rydberg interactions with the ancilla. Driving Rabi oscillations

weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method for special relativistic
hydrodynamics on unstructured triangular meshes. We rigorously prove that the
proposed method is physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), namely, always
preserves the positivity of the pressure and the rest-mass density as well as
the subluminal constraint on the fluid velocity. The method is built on a
highly efficient compact WENO reconstruction on unstructured meshes, a simple
PCP limiter, the provably PCP property of the Harten--Lax--van Leer flux, and
third-order strong-stability-preserving time discretization. Due to the
relativistic effects, the primitive variables (namely, the rest-mass density,
velocity, and pressure) are highly nonlinear implicit functions in terms of the
conservative variables, making the design and analysis of our method
nontrivial. To address the difficulties arising from the strong nonlinearity,
we adopt a novel quasilinear technique for the theoretical proof of the PCP
property. Three provable convergence-guaranteed iterative algorithms are also
introduced for the robust recovery of primitive quantities from admissible
conservative variables. We also propose a slight modification to an existing
WENO reconstruction to ensure the scaling invariance of the nonlinear weights
and thus to accommodate the homogeneity of the evolution operator, leading to
the advantages of the modified WENO reconstruction in resolving multi-scale
wave structures. Extensive numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the

stationary wave-energy spectrum that arises from a single-frequency wave
forcing is localised within a thin boundary layer around the constant-frequency

finite precision level in both local training and uplink transmission, is
proposed. Here, the finite precision level is captured through the use of
quantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and activations in
fixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device trains its QNN
and transmits a quantized training result to the base station. Energy models
for the local training and the transmission with quantization are rigorously
derived. To minimize the energy consumption and the number of communication
rounds simultaneously, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated
with respect to the number of local iterations, the number of selected devices,
and the precision levels for both local training and transmission while
ensuring convergence under a target accuracy constraint. To solve this problem,
the convergence rate of the proposed FL system is analytically derived with
respect to the system control variables. Then, the Pareto boundary of the
problem is characterized to provide efficient solutions using the normal
boundary inspection method. Design insights on balancing the tradeoff between
the two objectives while achieving a target accuracy are drawn from using the
Nash bargaining solution and analyzing the derived convergence rate. Simulation
results show that the proposed FL framework can reduce energy consumption until
convergence by up to 70\% compared to a baseline FL algorithm that represents
data with full precision without damaging the convergence rate.

  Augmentation and Detection",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lung nodule detection in chest X-ray (CXR) images is common to early
screening of lung cancers. Deep-learning-based Computer-Assisted Diagnosis
(CAD) systems can support radiologists for nodule screening in CXR. However, it
requires large-scale and diverse medical data with high-quality annotations to
train such robust and accurate CADs. To alleviate the limited availability of
such datasets, lung nodule synthesis methods are proposed for the sake of data
augmentation. Nevertheless, previous methods lack the ability to generate
nodules that are realistic with the size attribute desired by the detector. To
address this issue, we introduce a novel lung nodule synthesis framework in
this paper, which decomposes nodule attributes into three main aspects
including shape, size, and texture, respectively. A GAN-based Shape Generator
firstly models nodule shapes by generating diverse shape masks. The following
Size Modulation then enables quantitative control on the diameters of the
generated nodule shapes in pixel-level granularity. A coarse-to-fine gated
convolutional Texture Generator finally synthesizes visually plausible nodule
textures conditioned on the modulated shape masks. Moreover, we propose to
synthesize nodule CXR images by controlling the disentangled nodule attributes
for data augmentation, in order to better compensate for the nodules that are
easily missed in the detection task. Our experiments demonstrate the enhanced
image quality, diversity, and controllability of the proposed lung nodule
synthesis framework. We also validate the effectiveness of our data
augmentation on greatly improving nodule detection performance.

gravitational force, and vertical distance. This is based on the method
proposed by Camm for a single-component disk, which we extend here for a
multi-component disk by deriving the expression of the energy explicitly at any
galactocentric radius R. For a self-consistent distribution, the density and
force are obtained by jointly solving the equation of vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium and the Poisson equation. Substituting the numerical values for the
density distribution and force obtained for the coupled system, in the derived
expression of the energy, we find that the energy of each component remains
unchanged compared to the energy for the corresponding single-component case.
We explain this surprising result by simplifying the above expression for the
energy of a component analytically, which turns out to be equal to the surface
density times the squared vertical velocity dispersion of the component.
However, the energy required to raise a unit test mass to a certain height z
from the mid-plane is higher in the coupled case. The system is therefore more
tightly bound closer to the mid-plane, and hence it is harder to disturb it due
to an external tidal encounter.

an adversary interacts with k interactive mechanisms in parallel and can
interleave its queries to the mechanisms arbitrarily. Previously, Vadhan and

central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) schemes for the Euler equations with
gravity. A distinctive feature of these schemes is that they not only are WB
for a general known stationary hydrostatic solution, but also can preserve the
positivity of the fluid density and pressure. The standard CDG method does not
possess this feature, while directly applying some existing WB techniques to
the CDG framework may not accommodate the positivity and keep other important
properties at the same time. In order to obtain the WB and
positivity-preserving properties simultaneously while also maintaining the
conservativeness and stability of the schemes, a novel spatial discretization
is devised in the CDG framework based on suitable modifications to the
numerical dissipation term and the source term approximation. The modifications
are based on a crucial projection operator for the stationary hydrostatic
solution, which is proposed for the first time in this work. This novel
projection has the same order of accuracy as the standard $L^2$-projection, can
be explicitly calculated, and is easy to implement without solving any
optimization problems. More importantly, it ensures that the projected
stationary solution has the same cell averages on both the primal and dual
meshes, which is a key to achieve the desired properties of our schemes. Based
on some convex decomposition techniques, rigorous positivity-preserving
analyses for the resulting WB CDG schemes are carried out. Several one- and
two-dimensional numerical examples are performed to illustrate the desired
properties of these schemes, including the high-order accuracy, the WB
property, the robustness for simulations involving the low pressure or density,
high resolution for the discontinuous solutions and the small perturbations
around the equilibrium state.

detection task, few of them consider the unique topologies (Y-shape,
Fork-shape, nearly horizontal lane) of the lane markers, which leads to
sub-optimal solution. In this paper, we present a new method for lane detection
based on relay chain prediction. Specifically, our model predicts a
segmentation map to classify the foreground and background region. For each
pixel point in the foreground region, we go through the forward branch and
backward branch to recover the whole lane. Each branch decodes a transfer map
and a distance map to produce the direction moving to the next point, and how
many steps to progressively predict a relay station (next point). As such, our
model is able to capture the keypoints along the lanes. Despite its simplicity,
our strategy allows us to establish new state-of-the-art on four major
benchmarks including TuSimple, CULane, CurveLanes and LLAMAS.

paradigm aimed at finding a solution that is driven by sample data but is
protected against sampling errors. An increasingly popular approach, known as
Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO), achieves this by
applying the Wasserstein metric to construct a ball centred at the empirical
distribution and finding a solution that performs well against the most
adversarial distribution from the ball. In this paper, we present a general
framework for studying different choices of a Wasserstein metric and point out
the limitation of the existing choices. In particular, while choosing a
Wasserstein metric of a higher order is desirable from a data-driven
perspective, given its less conservative nature, such a choice comes with a
high price from a robustness perspective - it is no longer applicable to many
heavy-tailed distributions of practical concern. We show that this seemingly
inevitable trade-off can be resolved by our framework, where a new class of
Wasserstein metrics, called coherent Wasserstein metrics, is introduced. Like
Wasserstein DRO, distributionally robust optimization using the coherent
Wasserstein metrics, termed generalized Wasserstein distributionally robust
optimization (GW-DRO), has all the desirable performance guarantees:
finite-sample guarantee, asymptotic consistency, and computational
tractability. The worst-case expectation problem in GW-DRO is in general a
nonconvex optimization problem, yet we provide new analysis to prove its
tractability without relying on the common duality scheme. Our framework, as
shown in this paper, offers a fruitful opportunity to design novel Wasserstein
DRO models that can be applied in various contexts such as operations

accurate estimation of the clock state (i.e., the circadian phase) outside of
the laboratory has enormous potential for precision medicine. Several methods
that predict the phase from measurements collected with wearables (e.g., Apple
Watch) have been recently developed. However, computation of the uncertainty in
the estimation remains an open problem. The uncertainty analysis is necessary
because the estimation accuracy can largely change even by a small perturbation
of daily routine. Here, we present a method to account for the uncertainty and
estimate the circadian phase using a new extension of Kalman filtering named
the level set Kalman filter. Using the newly proposed method, we study the
relationship between phase uncertainty and process noise from various sources.
This allows the identification of the magnitude of the noise in the circadian
system, which is impossible with previous methods. Moreover, our study reveals
how much the uncertainty of the phase estimate of the central clock that is
inaccessibly located in the brain can be reduced when measurements of the
peripheral clock phase are given from wearables. We also show that our method
has a performance improvement over the previous methods. Finally, we apply our
method to real-world data to further identify its usefulness. These results set
the stage for systematically understanding the circadian dynamics in the real

Current methods suffer from performance degradation in this case due to

propose Det6D, the first full-degree-of-freedom 3D object detector without
spatial and postural limitations, to improve terrain robustness. We choose the
point-based framework by founding their capability of detecting objects in the
entire spatial range. To predict full-degree poses, including pitch and roll,
we design a ground-aware orientation branch that leverages the local ground
constraints. Given the difficulty of long-tail non-flat scene data collection
and 6D pose annotation, we present Slope-Aug, a data augmentation method for
synthesizing non-flat terrain from existing datasets recorded in flat scenes.
Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in different terrains. We further conducted an extended experiment

Specifically, all clients learn their local representations by minimizing the

Causally disconnected fields have the even steeper Batchelor spectrum. Here we
show that all three spectra are present in the small-scale dynamo. During the
kinematic stage, the Batchelor spectrum occurs on scales larger than the
energy-carrying scale of the turbulence, and the Kazantsev spectrum on smaller

Prandtl number of unity. In the saturated state, the dynamo develops a Saffman

in synthetic synchrotron emission maps showing the parity-even E polarization.
We also observe a significant excess in the E polarization over the parity-odd
B polarization at subresistive scales, and a deficiency at larger scales. This
finding is at odds with the observed excess in the Galactic microwave

computationally expensive. This paper investigates RFTs in comparison with
state-of-the art SBT methods. During the process, a neural network-based
hydrodynamic model that -- similar to RFTs -- relies on local drag coefficients
for computational efficiency was developed. However, the network is trained
using data from an SBT (regularized stokeslet segments method).The $R^2$ value

cold conditions molecules can proliferate. Interstellar Complex Organic
Molecules (iCOMs) are C-bearing species that contain at least six atoms. As
they are detected in young stellar objects, iCOMs are expected to inhabit the
early stages of the star formation evolution. In this study, we try to
determine which iCOMs are present in the outflow component of massive
protostars. To do this, we analyzed the morphological extension of blue- and
red-shifted iCOMs emission in a sample of eleven massive protostars employing
mapping observations at one mm within a ~1 GHz bandwidth for both IRAM-30m and
APEX telescopes. We modeled the iCOMs emission of the central pointing spectra
of our objects using the XCLASS LTE radiative transfer code. We detected the
presence of several iCOMs such as: CH3OH, 13CH3OH, CH3OCHO, C2H5C15N, and
c-C3H2)CH2. In G034.41+0.24, G327.29-0.58, G328.81+0.63, G333.13-0.43,
G340.97-1.02, G351.45+0.66 and G351.77-0.54, the iCOMs lines show a faint broad
line profile. Due to the offset peak positions of the blue- and red-shifted
emission, covering from ~0.1 to 0.5 pc, these wings are possibly related to
movements external to the compact core, such as large-scale low-velocity
outflows. We have also established a correlation between the parent iCOM
molecule CH3OH and the shock tracer SiO, reinforcing the hypothesis that shock
environments provide the conditions to boost the formation of iCOMs via
gas-phase reactions.

determine the form of galaxy structure in the relatively early universe. We use
visual morphologies and \textsc{Morfometryka} measures to perform quantitative

heterogeneous bidders. In particular, we consider the setting of selling to $n$
bidders whose values are drawn from $n$ independent but not necessarily
identical distributions. We work in the robust auction design regime, where we
assume the seller has no knowledge of the bidders' value distributions and must
design a mechanism that is prior-independent. While there have been many strong
results on prior-independent auction design in the i.i.d. setting, not much is
known for the heterogeneous setting, even though the latter is of significant
practical importance. Unfortunately, no prior-independent mechanism can hope to
always guarantee any approximation to Myerson's revenue in the heterogeneous
setting; similarly, no prior-independent mechanism can consistently do better
than the second-price auction. In light of this, we design a family of
(parametrized) randomized auctions which approximates at least one of these
benchmarks: For heterogeneous bidders with regular value distributions, our
mechanisms either achieve a good approximation of the expected revenue of an
optimal mechanism (which knows the bidders' distributions) or exceeds that of
the second-price auction by a certain multiplicative factor. The factor in the
latter case naturally trades off with the approximation ratio of the former
case. We show that our mechanism is optimal for such a trade-off between the
two cases by establishing a matching lower bound. Our result extends to selling
$k$ identical items to heterogeneous bidders with an additional $O\big(\ln^2
k\big)$-factor in our trade-off between the two cases.

consisting of Newtonian and non-Newtonian components, especially terminal
velocity of a rising bubble in a power-law fluid. A recent lattice Boltzmann
(LB) model is extended using power-law scheme to be able to simulate both
Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flows at high density and viscosity ratios.
Also, a variable mobility is introduced in this study to minimize the
unphysical error around small bubbles in the domain. A three-component fluid
flow system is examined using a constant and variable mobility. It is shown
that each component has more stability using variable mobility while constant
mobility causes interface dissipation, leading to mass loss gradually. In
addition, two test cases including power-law fluid flows driven between two
parallel plates are conducted to show the accuracy and capability of the model.
To find a grid-independent computational domain, a grid independency test is
carried out to show that a 200*400 domain size is suitable for our
computations. Then, terminal velocity of a rising bubble is compared to an
existing correlation in the literature, indicating that the results are in good
agreement with existing study so that average relative error in six different
cases is 5.66 %. Also, the simulated examples show good conformity to
experimental results over a range of the Reynolds and Eotvos numbers.

range of electronic properties. This work examines these effects for
heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN), an ubiquitous combination given the role of hBN as an
encapsulating material. By comparing results of density functional calculations
with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results, we
explore the hybridisation between the valence states of the TMD and hBN layers,
and show that it introduces avoided crossings between the TMD and hBN bands,
with umklapp processes opening `ghost' avoided crossings in individual bands.
Comparison between DFT and ARPES spectra for the MoSe$_2$/hBN heterostructure
shows that the valence bands of MoSe$_2$ and hBN are significantly further
separated in energy in experiment as compared to DFT. We then show that a novel
scissor operator can be applied to the hBN valence states in the DFT
calculations, to correct the band alignment and enable quantitative comparison
to ARPES, explaining avoided crossings and other features of band visibility in
the ARPES spectra.

the history of the Universe, where only a single galaxy (GNz11 at $z\approx11$)
is currently spectroscopically confirmed. Here we present a search for luminous
$z>10$ galaxies with $JWST$/NIRCam photometry spanning $\approx1-5\mu$m and
covering 49 arcmin$^{2}$ from the public Early Release Science programs (CEERS
and GLASS). Our most secure candidates are two $M_{\rm{UV}}\approx-21$ systems:
GLASS-z12 and GLASS-z10. These galaxies display abrupt $\gtrsim1.8$ mag breaks
in their spectral energy distributions, consistent with complete absorption of
flux bluewards of Lyman-$\alpha$ that is redshifted to $z=12.4^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$
and $z=10.4^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. Lower redshift interlopers such as quiescent
galaxies with strong Balmer breaks would be comfortably detected at $>5\sigma$
in multiple bands where instead we find no flux. From SED modeling we infer
that these galaxies have already built up $\sim 10^9$ solar masses in stars
over the $\lesssim300-400$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The brightness of these
sources enable morphological constraints. Tantalizingly, GLASS-z10 shows a
clearly extended exponential light profile, potentially consistent with a disk
galaxy of $r_{\rm{50}}\approx0.7$ kpc. These sources, if confirmed, join GNz11
in defying number density forecasts for luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV
luminosity functions, which require a survey area $>10\times$ larger than we
have studied here to find such luminous sources at such high redshifts. They
extend evidence from lower redshifts for little or no evolution in the bright
end of the UV luminosity function into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications
for just how early these galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that
future deep $JWST$ observations may identify relatively bright galaxies to much
earlier epochs than might have been anticipated.

options with the lowest cost or the highest value. In practice, these
cost/value quantities often come through processes such as measurement or
machine learning, which are noisy, with quantifiable noise distributions. To
take these noise distributions into account, one approach is to assume a prior
for the values, use it to build a posterior, and then apply standard stochastic
optimization to pick a solution. However, in many practical applications, such
prior distributions may not be available. In this paper, we study such
scenarios using a regret minimization model.
  In our model, the task is to pick the highest one out of $n$ values. The
values are unknown and chosen by an adversary, but can be observed through
noisy channels, where additive noises are stochastically drawn from known
distributions. The goal is to minimize the regret of our selection, defined as
the expected difference between the highest and the selected value on the
worst-case choices of values. We show that the na\""ive algorithm of picking the
highest observed value has regret arbitrarily worse than the optimum, even when
$n = 2$ and the noises are unbiased in expectation. On the other hand, we
propose an algorithm which gives a constant-approximation to the optimal regret
for any $n$. Our algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient,
and requires only minimal knowledge of the noise distributions.

we identify two bright candidates at $M_{UV}\simeq -21$ that are unambiguously
placed at $z\simeq 10.6$ and $z\simeq 12.2$, respectively. The total number of
galaxies discovered at $z>9$ is in line with the predictions of a non-evolving

discover galaxies at the high redshift frontier. The candidates are ideal

Therefore evanescent wave Johnson noise (EWJN) caused by thermal and vacuum

capture this recursive process, we introduce a method to generate a 3D shape

often used to refine shape descriptions, we build on top of vector-quantized
deep implicit functions that generate a distribution of high-quality shapes.
Results show that our method can generate shapes consistent with text

supports shape editing, extrapolation, and can enable new applications in

on the fraction of ULX transients. Here, we report the identification of a new
transient ULX in the galaxy NGC 55 (which we label as ULX-2), thanks to recent
XMM-Newton and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory observations. This object was
previously classified as a transient X-ray source with a luminosity around a
few 10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in a 2010 XMM-Newton observation. Thanks to new and
deeper observations ($\sim$ 130 ks each), we show that the source reaches a
luminosity peak $>1.6 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray spectrum of ULX-2
is much softer than in previous observations and fits in the class of soft
ULXs. It can be well described using a model with two thermal components, as
often found in ULXs. The time scales of the X-ray variability are of the order
of a month and are likely driven by small changes in the accretion rate or due
to super-orbital modulations, attributed to precession of the accretion disc,

interaction causes nucleation of a correlated insulator that takes place
through a quantum critical point. The universality class of the associated
quantum phase transition is determined by the correlation length exponent
$\nu^{-1}=d-\alpha$ and dynamic scaling exponent $z=\alpha$, set by the band
curvature. On the other hand, the fractional dispersion is protected against
long-range interaction due to its nonanalytic structure. Rather a linear Dirac
dispersion gets generated under coarse graining and the associated Fermi
velocity increases logarithmically in the infrared regime, thereby yielding a
two-fluid system. Altogether, correlated FDMs unfolds a new landscape,

Although the production of higher-spin particles is enhanced while primordial

metallicity galaxies to z ~ 1. Using a Keck/DEIMOS spectral database of about
18,000 galaxies between z = 0.2 and z = 1, we search for such extreme
emission-line galaxies with the goal of determining their metallicities. Using
the robust direct Te method, we identify 8 new extremely metal-poor galaxies
(XMPGs) with 12 + log O/H < 7.65, including one at 6.949 +/- 0.091, making it
the lowest metallicity galaxy reported to date at these redshifts. We also
improve upon the metallicities for two other XMPGs from previous work. We
investigate the evolution of H-beta using both instantaneous and continuous
starburst models, finding that XMPGs are best characterized by continuous
starburst models. Finally, we study the dependence on age of the build-up of
metals and the emission-line strength.

explained by the emergence of a new obscuring wind from the accretion disk.
Here we report on the striking long-term variability of the obscuring disk wind
in NGC 5548 including new observations taken in 2021-2022 with the Swift
Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
(COS). The X-ray spectral hardening as a result of obscuration has declined
over the years, reaching its lowest in 2022 at which point we find the broad C
IV UV absorption line to be nearly vanished. The associated narrow
low-ionization UV absorption lines, produced previously when shielded from the
X-rays, are also remarkably diminished in 2022. We find a highly significant
correlation between the variabilities of the X-ray hardening and the equivalent
width of the broad C IV absorption line, demonstrating that X-ray obscuration
is inherently linked to disk winds. We derive for the first time a relation
between the X-ray and UV covering fractions of the obscuring wind using its
long-term evolution. The diminished X-ray obscuration and UV absorption are
likely caused by an increasingly intermittent supply of outflowing streams from
the accretion disk. This results in growing gaps and interstices in the clumpy
disk wind, thereby reducing its covering fractions.

nuclei (AGN) is thought to be intrinsically related to radio jet production.
This difference may be explained by the presence of a strong magnetic field
(B-field) that enhances, or is the cause of, the accretion activity and the jet
power. Here, we report the first evidence of an intrinsic difference in the
dust polarized emission cores of four RL and five RQ obscured AGN using 89
$\mu$m polarization with HAWC+/SOFIA. We find that the thermal polarized
emission increases with the nuclear radio-loudness, $R_{20} = L_{\rm 5GHz}/
L_{\rm 20\mu m}$. The dust emission cores of RL AGN are measured to be
polarized, $\sim5-11$%, while RQ AGN are unpolarized, $<1$%. For RQ AGN, our
results are consistent with the observed region being filled with an
unmagnetized or highly turbulent, disk and/or expanding outflow at scales of
$5-130$ pc from the AGN. For RL AGN, the measured $89$ $\mu$m polarization
arises primarily from magnetically aligned dust grains associated with a
$5-130$ pc-scale dusty obscuring structure with a toroidal B-field orientation
highly offset, $65\pm22^{\circ}$, with respect to the jet axis. Our results
indicate that the size and strength of the B-fields surrounding the AGN are
intrinsically related to the strength of the jet power -- the stronger the jet
power is, the larger and stronger the toroidal B-field is. The detection of a
$\le130$ pc-scale ordered toroidal B-field suggests that a) the infalling gas
that fuels RL AGN is magnetized, b) there is a magnetohydrodynamic wind that
collimates the jet, and/or c) the jet is able to magnetize its surroundings.

differential line-of-sight velocities indicate the presence of a peak in their
three-dimensional intervelocity distribution at 130-150 km/s. It had been
argued that galaxy pairs in the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM,
should not exhibit such an intervelocity peak, while Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) predicts such a preferred intervelocity for paired galaxies.
However, no direct comparison with $\Lambda$CDM applying the same selection
criteria and methodology as the observational studies has been performed yet,
placing the comparison on unsure footing. To rectify this, we investigate this
potential challenge for $\Lambda$CDM by determining whether an analog of the
observed intervelocity peak is present in galaxy pairs within the
IllustrisTNG-300 cosmological simulation. We identify galaxy pairs following
the observational study's selection criteria, measure their projected velocity
difference, and analyse both the de-projected as well as the full velocity
difference for this galaxy pair sample in the simulation. We recover a
deprojected intervelocity peak at ~130 km/s for galaxy pairs selected from the
simulation. The full three-dimensional velocity information available for the
pairs in the simulation also reveals a clear preference for this intervelocity.
The intervelocity peak among galaxy pairs does not appear to be a feature
unique to MOND, but is also present in $\Lambda$CDM. It can thus not be claimed
as a unique success of either theory over the other. Developing the galaxy pair
intervelocity into a test of gravity in the low acceleration regime will
require more detailed studies to identify measurable differences in the models.

theories at finite couplings $g$ with the free theory at $g=0$. It is obtained
via an ordered exponential of the coupling flow operator integrated from $0$ to
$g$. Allowing multiple couplings, we find that the map in general depends on
the chosen integration contour in coupling space. This induces a large
functional freedom in the construction of the Nicolai map, which cancels in all
correlator computations. Under a certain condition on the coupling flow
operator the ambiguity disappears, and the power-series expansion for the map
collapses to a linear function in the coupling. A special role is played by
topological (theta) couplings, which do not affect perturbative correlation
functions but also alter the Nicolai map. We demonstate that for certain
'magical' theta values the uniqueness condition holds, providing an exact map
polynomial in the fields and independent of the integration contour. This
feature is related to critical points of the Nicolai map and the existence of
'instantons'. As a toy model, we work with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric
quantum mechanics. For a cubic superpotential and a theta term, we explicitly
compute the one-, two- and three-point correlation function to one-loop order

strongly overdamped by their interaction with electrons, can in turn lead to
the absence of electronic quasiparticles. Since transverse photons couple to
the electronic current, the appearance of non-Fermi-Liquid behavior strongly
depends on the lattice. In particular, we find that in a square lattice the
phase space for electron-photon scattering is reduced in such a way to preserve
the quasiparticles, while in a honeycomb lattice the latter are removed due to
a non-analytical frequency dependence of the damping $\propto |\omega|^{2/3}$.
Standard cavity probes could allow to measure the characteristic frequency

models in the realm of condensed matter physics, e.g., to identify a variety of
(bosonic) phonon and magnon lattice models which admit topologically nontrivial
free fermion models as superpartners. At the single-particle level, the bosonic
and the fermionic models that are generated by the SUSY are isospectral except
for zero modes, such as flat bands, whose existence is undergirded by the
Witten index of the SUSY theory. We develop a unifying framework to formulate
these SUSY connections in terms of general lattice graph correspondences and
discuss further ramifications such as the definition of supersymmetric
topological invariants for generic bosonic systems. Notably, a Hermitian form
of the supercharge operator, the generator of the SUSY, can itself be
interpreted as a hopping Hamiltonian on a bipartite lattice. This allows us to
identify a wide class of interconnected lattices whose tight-binding
Hamiltonians are superpartners of one another or can be derived via squaring or
square-rooting their energy spectra all the while preserving band topology
features. We introduce a five-fold way symmetry classification scheme of these

ground states affect long-distance correlations. These states are highly
entangled and feature algebraic correlations between local observables. As a
consequence, local measurements can have highly nonlocal effects. Our focus is
on Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) ground states, a continuous family of
critical states in one dimension whose structure is parameterized by a
Luttinger parameter $K$. We show that arbitrarily weak local measurements,
performed over extended regions of space, can conspire to drive transitions in
long-distance correlations. Conditioning first on a particular measurement
outcome we show that there is a transition in the character of the
post-measurement quantum state for $K<1$, and highlight a formal analogy with
the effect of a static impurity on transport through a TLL. To investigate the
full ensemble of measurement outcomes we consider averages of physical
quantities which are necessarily nonlinear in the system density matrix. We
show how their behavior can be understood within a replica field theory, and
for the measurements that we consider we find that the symmetry of the theory
under exchange of replicas is broken for $K<1/2$. A well-known barrier to
experimentally observing the collective effects of multiple measurements has
been the need to post-select on random outcomes. Here we resolve this problem
by introducing cross-correlations between experimental measurement results and
classical simulations, which act as resource-efficient probes of the
transition. The phenomena we discuss are moreover robust to local decoherence.

Nonetheless, the star field counterpart does not show the same characteristics,

formation history appear to differ significantly. We re-analyzed the

photometry provided by the ""Yes, Magellanic Clouds Again"" survey, to robustly
assess its age. First, we partially removed foreground and/or field stars by
means of parallaxes and proper motions obtained from the {\it Gaia} Early Data

the cleaned photometric catalogue to identify the isochrone that best matches
the CMD of KMHK 1762. The estimated age of KMHK 1762 is $\log (t) = 9.74 \pm

1762 the third confirmed age gap SC of the LMC. The physical existence of a
quiescent period of the LMC SC formation is questioned. We suggest it can be
the result of an observational bias, originated by the combination of shallow

dark matter spikes. We consider here the scenario in which dark matter is
comprised primarily of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with a
small sub-dominant contribution coming from PBHs, and revisit the constraints
on the annihilation of WIMPs in these spikes using observations of the
isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB) and the Cosmic Microwave Background

PBH mass functions. We find that the constraints derived using the IGRB have
been significantly overestimated (in some cases by many orders of magnitude),

27-44%) or overdiagnosis in some patients. Therefore, several research works
have tackled the challenge of automatically segmenting and extracting features
of the ROI from magnetic resonance images, as this process can greatly
facilitate many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, the lack of
clear prostate boundaries, the heterogeneity inherent to the prostate tissue,

of neutrino spin flavour precession (SFP) requires very high magnetic field.
This makes only a handful of systems suitable to study this phenomena. By the
observation of SFP, the Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos is expected to
be distinguished. In this work, we point out the potential of white dwarf (WD)
system in studying the spin-flavour oscillation of neutrinos. From recent
analysis, it has been found that young isolated WDs may harbor very strong
internal magnetic field, even without exhibiting any surface magnetic field.
The presence of magnetic field enhances the cooling process and along with
that, renders the spin-flavour oscillation of neutrinos emitted in the neutrino
cooling process. Employing the standard WD specifications, we analyse whether a
magnetized WD is a suitable environment to distinguish between the Dirac and
Majorana nature of neutrino. Lower value of spin flavour transition probability
implies reduced active neutrino flux which is possible to be estimated in
terrestrial neutrino detectors. We find that the spin flavour transition
probability of Dirac neutrinos is much higher in comparison to the Majorana
neutrino which converts the active neutrino flavours to sterile in a
significant amount. We also examine the sensitivity of the spin flavour
transition probability to the neutrino magnetic moment.

dominated by Alfv\'enic fluctuations and often deemed as nearly incompressible
far away from the Sun, as shown by in-situ measurements near 1AU. However, for
solar wind closer to the Sun, the plasma $\beta$ decreases (often lower than
unity) while the turbulent Mach number $M_t$ increases (can approach unity,
e.g., transonic fluctuations). These conditions could produce significantly
more compressible effects, characterized by enhanced density fluctuations, as
seen by several space missions. In this paper, a series of 3D MHD simulations
of turbulence are carried out to understand the properties of compressible
turbulence, particularly the generation of density fluctuations. We find that,
over a broad range of parameter space in plasma $\beta$, cross helicity and
polytropic index, the turbulent density fluctuations scale linearly as a
function of $M_t$, with the scaling coefficients showing weak dependence on
parameters. Furthermore, through detailed spatio-temporal analysis, we show
that the density fluctuations are dominated by low-frequency nonlinear
structures, rather than compressible MHD eigen-waves. These results could be
important for understanding how compressible turbulence contributes to solar
wind heating near the Sun.

incommensurate CDW whose intensity get weaker with increasing field, eventually
disappearing at the superconducting critical field, Hc2. To explain the origin

for a uniform triplet superconductor coexisting with three triplet pair density

sensitive to magnetic field due to their origin in a triplet PDW state, and
naturally explains our data. Our discovery of a CDW sensitive to magnetic

the ASynchronous OPtical Sampling (ASOPS) system to perform Electronically
Controlled OPtical Sampling (ECOPS) measurements. The former change improved
the deflection range of the beam, while also drastically reducing the coupling
of the two scanning axes, the combination of which resulted in a larger than
four-fold increase in the FOV area. The latter change significantly improves
the acquisition speed and frequency domain performance simultaneously by
improving measurement efficiency. To accomplish this, we characterized the
non-linear time-axis sampling behavior of the electro-mechanical system in the

neutrino flavor conversions. Fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs), one of
the collective neutrino conversion modes, potentially change the dynamics and
observables in core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. In
cases without neutrino-matter interactions (or collisions), FFCs are
essentially energy-independent, and therefore the single energy treatment has
been used in previous studies. However, neutrino-matter collisions in general
depend on neutrino energy, suggesting that energy-dependent features may emerge
in FFCs with collisions. In this paper, we perform dynamical simulations of
FFCs with iso-energetic scatterings (emulating nucleon scatterings) under
multi-energy treatment. We find that cancellation between in- and
out-scatterings happens in high energy region, which effectively reduces the
number of collisions and then affects the FFC dynamics. In fact, the lifetime
of FFCs is extended compared to the single-energy case, leading to large flavor
conversions. Our result suggests that the multi-energy treatment is mandatory
to gauge the sensitivity of FFCs to collisions. We also provide a useful
quantity to measure the importance of multi-energy effects of collisions on

work of Gordon and Loeb in which the Defender optimally trades-off investments
for lower likelihood of its system breach. Our two-sided model additionally has
an Attacker, assumed to be rational and also guided by economic considerations
in its decision-making, to which the Defender responds. Our model is a
simplified adaptation of a model proposed during the Cold War for weapons
deployment in the US. Our model may also be viewed as a Stackelberg game and,
from an analytic perspective, as a Max-Min problem, the analysis of which is
known to have to contend with discontinuous behavior. The complexity of our
simple model is rooted in its inherent nonlinearity and, more consequentially,
non-convexity of the objective function in the optimization. The possibilities
of the Attacker's actions add substantially to the risk to the Defender, and
the Defender's rational, risk-neutral optimal investments in general
substantially exceed the optimal investments predicted by the one-sided
Gordon-Loeb model. We obtain a succinct set of three decision types that
categorize all of the Defender's optimal investment decisions. Also, the
Defender's optimal decisions exhibit discontinuous behavior as the initial
vulnerability of its system is varied. The analysis is supplemented by
extensive numerical illustrations. The results from our model open several
major avenues for future work.

class-wise imbalance that head classes have more samples than tail classes, but
overlook the attribute-wise imbalance. In fact, even if the class is balanced,
samples within each class may still be long-tailed due to the varying
attributes. Note that the latter is fundamentally more ubiquitous and
challenging than the former because attributes are not just implicit for most
datasets, but also combinatorially complex, thus prohibitively expensive to be
balanced. Therefore, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized
Long-Tailed classification (GLT), to jointly consider both kinds of imbalances.
By ""generalized"", we mean that a GLT method should naturally solve the
traditional LT, but not vice versa. Not surprisingly, we find that most
class-wise LT methods degenerate in our proposed two benchmarks: ImageNet-GLT

of class distribution while neglecting to learn attribute-invariant features.
To this end, we propose an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) method as the first
strong baseline for GLT. IFL first discovers environments with divergent
intra-class distributions from the imperfect predictions and then learns
invariant features across them. Promisingly, as an improved feature backbone,
IFL boosts all the LT line-up: one/two-stage re-balance, augmentation, and
ensemble. Codes and benchmarks are available on Github:

changed how we interact with each other and as a society, bringing with it new

abused and they are routinely used to attempt to cause harm at scale. One of
the most significant offence types that is enabled by these platforms is child
sexual abuse - both scaling existing abuse and enabling entirely new types of
online-only abuse where the impacts on the victim are equally catastrophic.
Many platforms invest significantly in combating this crime, referring
confirmed evidence of illegality to law enforcement. The introduction of
end-to-end encryption and similar technologies breaks many of the mitigations
in place today and this has led to a debate around the apparent dichotomy of
good child safety and good general user privacy and security. This debate has
concentrated on the problem of detecting offenders sharing known abuse imagery
using a technique known as client side scanning. We will show that the real
problem of online child sexual abuse is much more complex than offender image
sharing, providing a new set of 'harm archetypes' to better group harms into

baths, and investigate the role of quantum coherences in heat transport in both
the transient regime and in the nonequilibrium steady-state. In our model,
energy is exchanged between the baths through two parallel pathways, which can
be made distinct through the nondegeneracy of excited levels (energy splitting
$\Delta$) and a control parameter $\alpha$, which adjusts the strength of one
of the arms. Using a nonsecular quantum master equation of Redfield form, we
succeed in deriving closed-form expressions for the quantum coherences and the
heat current in the steady state limit for closely degenerate excited levels.
By including three ingredients in our analysis: nonequilibrium baths,
nondegeneracy of levels, and asymmetry of pathways, we show that quantum
coherences are generated and sustained in the V model in the steady-state limit
if three conditions, conjoining thermal and coherent effects are simultaneously
met: (i) The two baths are held at different temperatures. (ii) Bath-induced
pathways do not interfere destructively. (iii) Thermal rates do not mingle with
the control parameter $\alpha$ to destroy interferences through an effective
local equilibrium condition. We find that coherences are maximized when the
heat current is suppressed. On the other hand, the secular Redfield quantum
master equation is shown to fail in a broad range of parameters. Although we
mainly focus on analytical results in the steady state limit, numerical
simulations reveal that the transient behavior of coherences contrasts the
steady-state limit, suggesting that different mechanisms are at play in these
two regimes. Enhancing either the lifetime of transient coherences or their
magnitude at steady state thus requires the control and optimization of
different physical parameters.

constructs the adapter via a key-value cache model from the few-shot training
set, and updates the prior knowledge encoded in CLIP by feature retrieval. On
top of that, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted to be
state-of-the-art on ImageNet by fine-tuning the cache model for 10$\times$
fewer epochs than existing methods, which is both effective and efficient. We
conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on 11 datasets to

highlight the peculiar action of the Dice loss in the presence of missing or
empty labels. First, we formulate a theoretical basis that gives a general
description of the Dice loss and its derivative. It turns out that the choice
of the reduction dimensions $\Phi$ and the smoothing term $\epsilon$ is
non-trivial and greatly influences its behavior. We find and propose heuristic
combinations of $\Phi$ and $\epsilon$ that work in a segmentation setting with
either missing or empty labels. Second, we empirically validate these findings
in a binary and multiclass segmentation setting using two publicly available
datasets. We confirm that the choice of $\Phi$ and $\epsilon$ is indeed
pivotal. With $\Phi$ chosen such that the reductions happen over a single batch
(and class) element and with a negligible $\epsilon$, the Dice loss deals with
missing labels naturally and performs similarly compared to recent adaptations
specific for missing labels. With $\Phi$ chosen such that the reductions happen
over multiple batch elements or with a heuristic value for $\epsilon$, the Dice
loss handles empty labels correctly. We believe that this work highlights some
essential perspectives and hope that it encourages researchers to better
describe their exact implementation of the Dice loss in future work.

class of open quantum systems in Lindblad approximation with the use of the
stochastic Schroedinger equation approach. We show that depending on the
initial quantum state preparation, an ensemble of qubits can evolve into a rich

energy sources for reionization and the thermal evolution of the early
intergalactic medium. However, X-ray sources at high redshift have remained
largely inaccessible to observations. One alternative approach to study the
overall effect of X-ray feedback in the early Universe is a full cosmological
simulation. Toward this goal, in this paper we create an analytic model of
X-ray feedback from accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), to be used
as a sub-grid model in future cosmological simulations. Our analytic model
provides a relation between the mass of a dark matter halo and the SMBH it
hosts, where the efficiency is governed by an energy balance argument between
thermal feedback and the confining gravitational potential of the halo. To
calibrate the model, we couple the halo-level recipe with the Press-Schechter
halo mass function and derive global mass and energy densities. We then compare
our model to various observational constraints, such as the resulting soft
X-ray and IR cosmic radiation backgrounds, to test our choice of model
parameters. We in particular derive model parameters that do not violate any
constraints, while providing maximal X-ray feedback prior to reionization. In
addition, we consider the contribution of SMBH X-ray sources to reionization
and the global 21 cm absorption signal.

impact of longer and more in-depth feedback remains unclear. In this paper, we
explore the design and evaluation of feedback for graphical perception tasks,

lines in the EIS wavebands. Both formulae should be valid in regions of fairly
uniform emission such as coronal holes and quiet Sun, but not faint areas close
(around 100"") to bright active regions. The formula for EIS is used to estimate
the scattered light component of Fe XII 195.12 for seven on-disk coronal holes
observed between 2010 and 2018. Scattered light contributions of 56% to 100%
are found, suggesting that these features are dominated by scattered light,
consistent with earlier work of Wendeln \& Landi. Emission lines from the S X
and Si X ions - formed at the same temperature as Fe XII and often used to
derive the first ionization potential (FIP) bias from EIS data - are also
expected to be dominated by scattered light in coronal holes.

concerns. In this paper, we show a new observation that pre-trained models and
fine-tuned models have significantly high similarities in weight values. Also,
we demonstrate that there exist vendor-specific computing patterns even for the

black-box victim model with vendor-specific computing patterns and then
estimates the entire model weights based on the weight value similarities

interact with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disc. Over time, prograde
orbiters (inclination $i<90^{\circ}$) decrease inclination, as well as
semi-major axis $(a)$ and eccentricity $(e)$ until orbital alignment with the
gas disc ('disc capture'). Captured stellar-origin black holes (sBH) add to the
embedded AGN population which drives sBH-sBH mergers detectable in
gravitational waves using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) or sBH-SMBH mergers detectable
with LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). Captured stars can be tidally
disrupted by sBH or the SMBH or rapidly grow into massive 'immortal' stars.
Here, we investigate the behaviour of polar and retrograde orbiters $(i \geq
90^{\circ})$ interacting with the disc. We show that retrograde stars are
captured faster than prograde stars, flip to prograde orientation
$(i<90^{\circ})$ during capture, and decrease $a$ dramatically towards the
SMBH. For sBH, we find a critical angle $i_{\rm ret} \sim 113^{\circ}$, below
which retrograde sBH decay towards embedded prograde orbits $(i \to
0^{\circ})$, while for $i_{\rm o}>i_{\rm ret}$ sBH decay towards embedded
retrograde orbits $(i \to 180^{\circ})$. sBH near polar orbits $(i \sim
90^{\circ})$ and stars on nearly embedded retrograde orbits $(i \sim
180^{\circ})$ show the greatest decreases in $a$. Whether a star is captured by
the disc within an AGN lifetime depends primarily on disc density, and
secondarily on stellar type and initial $a$. For sBH, disc capture-time is
longest for polar orbits, low mass sBH and lower density discs. Larger mass sBH
should typically spend more time in AGN discs, with implications for the
embedded sBH spin distribution.

introduced by one of the authors involving a one-dimensional quantum transverse
field Ising model with added 3-spin interaction. While many of the ideas are
quite general, there are other aspects that are not. In particular, a line of
criticality with continuously varying exponents is not captured. However, the
exact solvability of the model gives us considerable confidence in our results.
Although the pure system is analytically exactly solved, the disorder case
requires numerical analyses based on exact computation of the correlation
function in the Pfaffian representation. The disorder case leads to dynamic

classical zero modes that are robust to many but not all distortions of the
Hamiltonian. It arises naturally from locality in systems whose interactions
form a set of constraints such as in geometrically frustrated magnets and balls
and springs metamaterials. For a magnet whose classical limit exhibits
topological frustration, an important question is what happens to this topology
when the degrees of freedom are quantized and whether such frustration could
lead to exotic quantum phases of matter like a spin liquid. We answer these
questions for a geometrically frustrated spin ladder model. It has the feature
of having infinitely many conserved quantities that aid the solution. We find
classical zero modes all get lifted by quantum fluctuations and the system is
left with a unique rung singlet ground state -- a trivial quantum spin liquid.
Moreover, we find low-energy eigenstates corresponding to known symmetry
protected topological (SPT) ground states, and a special role of $SU(2)$
symmetry, that it demands the existence of extra dimensions of classical zero
modes -- the phenomena we call symmetry-enriched topological frustration
(SETF). These results suggest small violations of the conservation laws in the
nearly SETF regime could lead to quantum scars. We further study a
two-dimensional bilayer triangular lattice model and find a similar SETF
phenomena which also leads to suppressed low-energy topological eigenstates in
the quantum regime. These results suggest that in the absence of magnetic
order, classical topological frustration manifests at finite spin as
asymptotically low energy modes with support for exotic quantum phenomena.

investments in renewable energy resources. The requirements for operating and
planning power systems are becoming stringent because of the need to take into
account the uncertainty associated with renewable generation. Several modeling
frameworks that consider the inherent uncertainty in the operation and planning
of the power system have been extensively studied. Stochastic optimization has
been the most popular approach among these frameworks due to its intuitive
representation, especially when formulated using discrete probabilistic
scenarios to represent the random variables. Although many scenarios
representing all possible uncertain operating conditions would be needed to
accurate evaluate stochastic operation and planning models, the size of the
scenario set impacts computational complexity, posing a significant tradeoff
between uncertainty detail representation and computational tractability.
  During the last decade, a large body of research has focused on developing
new scenario aggregation methods to derive reduced scenario sets that show
properties similar to the original scenario set while decreasing computational
burden. This review provides an up-to-date, comprehensive classification and

decision-making with good out-of-sample performance is a key challenge. The
observation that good in-sample performance does not guarantee good
out-of-sample performance is generally known as overfitting. Practical
overfitting can typically not be attributed to a single cause but instead is
caused by several factors all at once. We consider here three overfitting
sources: (i) statistical error as a result of working with finite sample data,
(ii) data noise which occurs when the data points are measured only with finite
precision, and finally (iii) data misspecification in which a small fraction of
all data may be wholly corrupted. We argue that although existing data-driven
formulations may be robust against one of these three sources in isolation they
do not provide holistic protection against all overfitting sources
simultaneously. We design a novel data-driven formulation which does guarantee
such holistic protection and is furthermore computationally viable. Our
distributionally robust optimization formulation can be interpreted as a novel
combination of a Kullback-Leibler and Levy-Prokhorov robust optimization
formulation. Finally, we show how in the context of classification and
regression problems several popular regularized and robust formulations reduce

linearity. These deviations can be rationalized with fracture mechanics and
imply that less work is necessary to generate debris than what was assumed.
Here, we postulate that the work needed to detach a wear particle is made of
the surface energy expended to create new fracture surfaces, and also of
plastic work within a fracture process zone of a given width around the cracks.
Our theoretical model, validated by molecular dynamics simulations, reveals a
super-linear scaling relation between debris volume ($V_d$) and tangential work
($W_t$): $V_d \sim W_t^{3/2}$ in 3D and $V_d \sim W_t^{2}$ in 2D. This study
provides a theoretical foundation to estimate the statistical distribution of

reorientation, also known as orthogonal switching, of metallic Mn$_2$Au and
CuMnAs has opened the door for ultrafast writing of an antiferromagnet (AFM).
Phenomenological theory predicts that the minimum field necessary for SOT
switching -- critical field -- for ultrashort pulses increases inversely
proportional to the pulse duration, thereby limiting the use of ultrafast
stimulus as driving force for switching. We explore the possibility that by
varying the working temperature the critical field reduces enabling orthogonal
switching in response to ultrashort pulses. To do so, we extend previous theory
to finite temperature and show that the critical field for an orthogonal
switching strongly depends on temperature. We determine how the temperature
dependence of the critical field varies as a function of the pulse duration.
While for long pulses, the temperature dependence of the critical field is
determined by the anisotropy field, for ultrashort pulses, it is determined by
the characteristic frequency of the AFM. We show that the short and long pulse
duration limits for the critical field can be connected by an analytical
expression.

which the private data of a large number of distributed clients is used to
develop a global model under the coordination of a central server without
explicitly exposing the data. The standard FL strategy has a number of
significant bottlenecks including large communication requirements and high
impact on the clients' resources. Several strategies have been described in the
literature trying to address these issues. In this paper, a novel scheme based
on the notion of ""model growing"" is proposed. Initially, the server deploys a
small model of low complexity, which is trained to capture the data complexity
during the initial set of rounds. When the performance of such a model
saturates, the server switches to a larger model with the help of
function-preserving transformations. The model complexity increases as more
data is processed by the clients, and the overall process continues until the
desired performance is achieved. Therefore, the most complex model is broadcast
only at the final stage in our approach resulting in substantial reduction in
communication cost and client computational requirements. The proposed approach
is tested extensively on three standard benchmarks and is shown to achieve
substantial reduction in communication and client computation while achieving
comparable accuracy when compared to the current most effective strategies.

stratification and turbulence has been widely studied and can be explained by
the 'instability' of a sufficiently strongly stably stratified turbulent flow
due to the decrease of the turbulent density flux with increasing
stratification via the 'Phillips mechanism'. However, such density staircases
are not often observed in ocean interiors, except in regions where double
diffusion processes are important, leading to thermohaline staircases. Using
reduced order models for the evolution of velocity and density gradients, we
analyse staircase formation in stratified and sheared turbulent flows. Under
the assumption of inertial scaling $\epsilon \sim U^3/L$ for the kinetic energy
dissipation rate $\epsilon$, where $U$ and $L$ are characteristic velocity and
length scales, we determine ranges of bulk Richardson numbers $\text{Ri}_{b}$
and turbulent Prandtl numbers $\text{Pr}_{T}$ for which staircases can
potentially form and show that the Phillips mechanism only survives in the
limit of sufficiently small turbulent Prandtl numbers. For relevant oceanic
parameters, a range of turbulent Prandtl numbers above which the system is not
prone to staircases is found to be $\text{Pr}_T \simeq 0.5 - 0.7$. Since
several studies indicate that the turbulent Prandtl number in stably stratified
turbulence and in ocean interiors is usually above this threshold, this result
supports the empirical observation that staircases are not favoured in ocean
interiors in the presence of ambient turbulence. We also show that our analysis
is robust to other scalings for $\epsilon$ (such as the more strongly
stratified scaling $\epsilon \sim U^{2}N$, where $N$ is a characteristic value
of the buoyancy frequency), supporting our results in both shear-dominated and
buoyancy-dominated turbulent regimes as well as in weakly and strongly
stratified regimes.

initiates at 300C, the hyperbolic dispersion persists up to 500C. Direct finite

20 Li$_2^{100}$MoO$_4$ (LMO) calorimeters each equipped with a Ge light

of a search for two-neutrino and neutrinoless double beta decays of $^{100}$Mo
to the first 0$^+$ and $2^+$ excited states of $^{100}$Ru using the full
CUPID-Mo exposure (2.71 kg$\times$yr of LMO). We measure the half-life of
$2\nu\beta\beta$ decay to the $0^{+}_1$ state as $T_{1/2}^{2\nu \rightarrow

$T_{1/2}^{0\nu\rightarrow 0_1^+}>1.2\times10^{23} \ \mathrm{yr}\ \text{(90 %

us to make the first comparison of the single state (SSD) and higher state

various source types, source offsets, numbers of receivers, and receiver

applying it to a classic near-surface geophysics problem, namely, imaging a
two-layer, undulating, soil-over-bedrock interface. This problem was recently
investigated in our group by developing a time-distance CNN, which showed great
promise but lacked flexibility in utilizing different field-testing

comparable accuracy to the time-distance CNN while providing greater
flexibility to handle varied field applications. The frequency-velocity CNN was
trained, validated, and tested using 100,000 synthetic near-surface models. The
ability of the proposed frequency-velocity CNN to generalize across various
acquisition configurations is first tested using synthetic near-surface models
with different acquisition configurations from that of the training set, and
then applied to experimental field data collected at the Hornsby Bend site in
Austin, Texas, USA. When fully developed for a wider range of geological

architecture of IEQNET, including the Internet-inspired layered hierarchy that
leverages software-defined networking (SDN) technology to perform traditional

decouples the control and data planes, with the control plane being entirely

address issues associated with synchronization, calibration, network

extent to which the control plane classical signals can co-propagate with the
data plane quantum signals in the same fiber lines (quantum-classical signal
""coexistence""). This goal is furthered by the use of tunable narrow-band
optical filtering at the receivers and, at least in some cases, a wide
wavelength separation between the quantum and classical channels. We envision
IEQNET to aid in developing robust and practical quantum networks by
demonstrating metro-scale quantum communication tasks such as entanglement

potential vorticity and boundary buoyancy. We begin by developing the
geostrophic turbulence theory of boundary buoyancy anomalies in a fluid with
vanishing potential vorticity. We find that the vertical stratification
controls both the interaction range of boundary buoyancy anomalies and the
dispersion of boundary-trapped Rossby waves. Buoyancy anomalies generate longer
range velocity fields and more dispersive Rossby waves over decreasing
stratification [$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}{z} \leq 0$, where $N(z)$ is the
buoyancy frequency] than over increasing stratification
[$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}{z} \geq 0$]. Consequently, the surface kinetic
energy spectrum is steeper over decreasing (mixed-layer like) stratification
than in the classical uniformly stratified model. We also find that the
nonlinear interplay of Rossby waves with the turbulence spontaneously
reorganizes the flow into homogenized zones of surface buoyancy separated by
buoyancy discontinuities, with sharp eastward jets centered at the
discontinuities. Jet dynamics then depend on the vertical stratification. Over
decreasing stratification, we obtain straight jets perturbed by dispersive
eastward propagating waves. Over increasing stratification, we obtain
meandering jets whose shape evolves in time due to westward propagating weakly
dispersive waves. Finally, we investigate normal modes in the presence of
boundary-confined restoring forces, with the ultimate aim of obtaining an
energy-conserving modal truncation of the quasigeostrophic equations. Such a
modal truncation would generalize classical $N$-layer models to account for
non-isentropic boundaries. However, we find that the loss of a crucial symmetry
in the vertical coupling between the modes prevents modal truncations from
conserving energy, and so no such modal truncation is possible.

that perform well in the worst case among a set of possible environment
parameter values. In real-world environments, choosing the set of possible
values for robust RL can be a difficult task. When that set is specified too
narrowly, the agent will be left vulnerable to reasonable parameter values
unaccounted for. When specified too broadly, the agent will be too cautious. In
this paper, we propose Feasible Adversarial Robust RL (FARR), a novel problem
formulation and objective for automatically determining the set of environment
parameter values over which to be robust. FARR implicitly defines the set of
feasible parameter values as those on which an agent could achieve a benchmark
reward given enough training resources. By formulating this problem as a
two-player zero-sum game, optimizing the FARR objective jointly produces an
adversarial distribution over parameter values with feasible support and a
policy robust over this feasible parameter set. We demonstrate that approximate
Nash equilibria for this objective can be found using a variation of the PSRO
algorithm. Furthermore, we show that an optimal agent trained with FARR is more
robust to feasible adversarial parameter selection than with existing minimax,
domain-randomization, and regret objectives in a parameterized gridworld and
three MuJoCo control environments.

spectro-polarimetric studies of GRBs. Here, we present the first catalog of GRB
polarization measurements made by CZTI during its first five years of
operation. This presents the time integrated polarization measurements of the
prompt emission of 20 GRBs in the energy range 100-600 keV. The sample includes
the bright GRBs which were detected within an angle range of 0-60 degree and
120-180 degree where the instrument has useful polarization sensitivity and is
less prone to systematics. We implement a few new modifications in the analysis
to enhance polarimetric sensitivity of the instrument. Majority of the GRBs in
the sample are found to possess less / null polarization across the total
bursts' duration in contrast to a small fraction of five GRBs exhibiting high
polarization. The low polarization across the bursts can be speculated to be
either due to the burst being intrinsically weakly polarized or due to varying
polarization angle within the burst even when it is highly polarized. In
comparison to POLAR measurements, CZTI has detected a larger number of cases
with high polarization. This may be a consequence of the higher energy window
of CZTI observations which results in the sampling of smaller duration of burst
emissions in contrast to POLAR, thereby, probing emissions of less temporal
variations of polarization properties.

  concept learnability, and human capability","Published at CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Concept-based interpretability methods aim to explain deep neural network
model predictions using a predefined set of semantic concepts. These methods
evaluate a trained model on a new, ""probe"" dataset and correlate model
predictions with the visual concepts labeled in that dataset. Despite their
popularity, they suffer from limitations that are not well-understood and
articulated by the literature. In this work, we analyze three commonly
overlooked factors in concept-based explanations. First, the choice of the
probe dataset has a profound impact on the generated explanations. Our analysis
reveals that different probe datasets may lead to very different explanations,
and suggests that the explanations are not generalizable outside the probe
dataset. Second, we find that concepts in the probe dataset are often less
salient and harder to learn than the classes they claim to explain, calling
into question the correctness of the explanations. We argue that only visually
salient concepts should be used in concept-based explanations. Finally, while
existing methods use hundreds or even thousands of concepts, our human studies
reveal a much stricter upper bound of 32 concepts or less, beyond which the
explanations are much less practically useful. We make suggestions for future
development and analysis of concept-based interpretability methods. Code for

Internet of Things (IoT) devices has attracted much attention from industry and
academia since it greatly facilitates our lives by providing various
rapid-response services. Due to the limited resources of IoT devices,
cloud-assisted training of CNN models has become the mainstream. However, most
existing related works suffer from a large amount of model parameter
transmission and weak model robustness. To this end, this paper proposes a
cloud-assisted CNN training framework with low model parameter transmission and
strong model robustness. In the proposed framework, we first introduce MonoCNN,
which contains only a few learnable filters, and other filters are
nonlearnable. These nonlearnable filter parameters are generated according to
certain rules, i.e., the filter generation function (FGF), and can be saved and
reproduced by a few random seeds. Thus, the cloud server only needs to send
these learnable filters and a few seeds to the IoT device. Compared to
transmitting all model parameters, sending several learnable filter parameters
and seeds can significantly reduce parameter transmission. Then, we investigate
multiple FGFs and enable the IoT device to use the FGF to generate multiple
filters and combine them into MonoCNN. Thus, MonoCNN is affected not only by
the training data but also by the FGF. The rules of the FGF play a role in
regularizing the MonoCNN, thereby improving its robustness. Experimental
results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, our proposed framework
can reduce a large amount of model parameter transfer between the cloud server
and the IoT device while improving the performance by approximately 2.2% when
dealing with corrupted data. The code is available at

development. This stimulates the development of the so-called natural

fundus images using CNNs relies on access to massive data for training and
validation - hundreds of thousands of images. However, data residency and data
privacy restrictions stymie the applicability of this approach in medical
settings where patient confidentiality is a mandate. Here, we showcase results
for the performance of DL on small datasets to classify patient sex from fundus
images - a trait thought not to be present or quantifiable in fundus images
until recently. We fine-tune a Resnet-152 model whose last layer has been
modified for binary classification. In several experiments, we assess
performance in the small dataset context using one private (DOVS) and one
public (ODIR) data source. Our models, developed using approximately 2500
fundus images, achieved test AUC scores of up to 0.72 (95% CI: [0.67, 0.77]).
This corresponds to a mere 25% decrease in performance despite a nearly
1000-fold decrease in the dataset size compared to prior work in the
literature. Even with a hard task like sex categorization from retinal images,
we find that classification is possible with very small datasets. Additionally,
we perform domain adaptation experiments between DOVS and ODIR; explore the
effect of data curation on training and generalizability; and investigate model
ensembling to maximize CNN classifier performance in the context of small

explicitly generate a sequence of edit operations, and this edit operation
sequence can translate the reference caption into a refined one. Compared to
the implicit editing, ECE has multiple advantages: 1) Explainable: it can trace

network (HyperNet) to accomplish pixel-wise feature representation for
effective hyperspectral change detection. Concretely, not patches but the whole
images are fed into the network and the multi-temporal spatial-spectral
features are compared pixel by pixel. Instead of processing the two-dimensional
imaging space and spectral response dimension in hybrid style, a powerful
spatial-spectral attention module is put forward to explore the spatial
correlation and discriminative spectral features of multi-temporal
hyperspectral images (HSIs), separately. Only the positive samples at the same
location of bi-temporal HSIs are created and forced to be aligned, aiming at
learning the spectral difference-invariant features. Moreover, a new similarity
loss function named focal cosine is proposed to solve the problem of imbalanced
easy and hard positive samples comparison, where the weights of those hard
samples are enlarged and highlighted to promote the network training. Six
hyperspectral datasets have been adopted to test the validity and
generalization of proposed HyperNet. The extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of HyperNet over the state-of-the-art algorithms on downstream
hyperspectral change detection tasks.

the framework of large deviation theory, we show that the fluctuation of

naturally in the infinitely large data limit. We demonstrate the conditional
probability distribution of the intensity variable also follows the Boltzmann
statistics and the conjugate variable of the intensive variable is the
extensive variable, indicating a thermodynamic duality symmetry between
conjugate variables in the superstatistical systems. A new thermodynamic
relation between the entropy functions of conjugate variables is obtained.
Moreover, due to the heterogeneity of the superstatistical dataset, uncertainty

shifts, with access to only the unlabeled test samples from the new domain at
test-time. Prior TTA methods optimize over unsupervised objectives such as the
entropy of model predictions in TENT [Wang et al., 2021], but it is unclear
what exactly makes a good TTA loss. In this paper, we start by presenting a
surprising phenomenon: if we attempt to meta-learn the best possible TTA loss
over a wide class of functions, then we recover a function that is remarkably
similar to (a temperature-scaled version of) the softmax-entropy employed by
TENT. This only holds, however, if the classifier we are adapting is trained
via cross-entropy; if trained via squared loss, a different best TTA loss
emerges. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze TTA through the lens of the
training losses's convex conjugate. We show that under natural conditions, this
(unsupervised) conjugate function can be viewed as a good local approximation
to the original supervised loss and indeed, it recovers the best losses found
by meta-learning. This leads to a generic recipe that can be used to find a
good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general
class. Empirically, our approach consistently dominates other baselines over a
wide range of benchmarks. Our approach is particularly of interest when applied
to classifiers trained with novel loss functions, e.g., the recently-proposed
PolyLoss, where it differs substantially from (and outperforms) an
entropy-based loss. Further, we show that our approach can also be interpreted
as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which we refer to

in many natural language tasks. However, performance on leaderboards is
generally achieved by leveraging massive amounts of training data, and rarely
by encoding explicit linguistic knowledge into neural models. This has led many
to question the relevance of linguistics for modern natural language
processing. In this dissertation, I present several case studies to illustrate
how theoretical linguistics and neural language models are still relevant to
each other. First, language models are useful to linguists by providing an
objective tool to measure semantic distance, which is difficult to do using
traditional methods. On the other hand, linguistic theory contributes to
language modelling research by providing frameworks and sources of data to
probe our language models for specific aspects of language understanding.
  This thesis contributes three studies that explore different aspects of the
syntax-semantics interface in language models. In the first part of my thesis,
I apply language models to the problem of word class flexibility. Using mBERT
as a source of semantic distance measurements, I present evidence in favour of
analyzing word class flexibility as a directional process. In the second part
of my thesis, I propose a method to measure surprisal at intermediate layers of
language models. My experiments show that sentences containing morphosyntactic
anomalies trigger surprisals earlier in language models than semantic and
commonsense anomalies. Finally, in the third part of my thesis, I adapt several
psycholinguistic studies to show that language models contain knowledge of
argument structure constructions. In summary, my thesis develops new
connections between natural language processing, linguistic theory, and
psycholinguistics to provide fresh perspectives for the interpretation of
language models.

Local behavior data helps the systems emphasize the prediction locality and
better understand the impact of static map objects on moving agents. We propose

forecasting accuracy by fusing information from observed trajectories, HD maps,

increasing attention due to its wide applications. The artistic text can be
divided into three components, content, font, and texture, respectively.
Existing artistic text generation models usually focus on manipulating one
aspect of the above components, which is a sub-optimal solution for
controllable general artistic text generation. To remedy this issue, we propose
a novel approach, namely GenText, to achieve general artistic text style
transfer by separably migrating the font and texture styles from the different
source images to the target images in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, our
current work incorporates three different stages, stylization, destylization,
and font transfer, respectively, into a unified platform with a single powerful
encoder network and two separate style generator networks, one for font
transfer, the other for stylization and destylization. The destylization stage
first extracts the font style of the font reference image, then the font
transfer stage generates the target content with the desired font style.
Finally, the stylization stage renders the resulted font image with respect to
the texture style in the reference image. Moreover, considering the difficult
data acquisition of paired artistic text images, our model is designed under
the unsupervised setting, where all stages can be effectively optimized from
unpaired data. Qualitative and quantitative results are performed on artistic
text benchmarks, which demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
model. The code with models will become publicly available in the future.

we construct synthetic sets of data on each client to locally match the loss

medical image segmentation. However, they are limited in their ability to
encode topological interactions among different classes (e.g., containment and
exclusion). These constraints naturally arise in biomedical images and can be
crucial in improving segmentation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel
topological interaction module to encode the topological interactions into a
deep neural network. The implementation is completely convolution-based and
thus can be very efficient. This empowers us to incorporate the constraints
into end-to-end training and enrich the feature representation of neural
networks. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on different types
of interactions. We also demonstrate the generalizability of the method on both
proprietary and public challenge datasets, in both 2D and 3D settings, as well

bodies, and it is usually measured via their scientific productivity,
citations, or a combined metric such as h-index. Assessing young researchers is
more critical because it takes a while to get citations and increment of
h-index. Hence, predicting the h-index can help to discover the researchers'
scientific impact. In addition, identifying the influential factors to predict
the scientific impact is helpful for researchers seeking solutions to improve
it. This study investigates the effect of author, paper and venue-specific
features on the future h-index. For this purpose, we used machine learning
methods to predict the h-index and feature analysis techniques to advance the
understanding of feature impact. Utilizing the bibliometric data in Scopus, we
defined and extracted two main groups of features. The first relates to prior
scientific impact, and we name it 'prior impact-based features' and includes
the number of publications, received citations, and h-index. The second group
is 'non-impact-based features' and contains the features related to author,
co-authorship, paper, and venue characteristics. We explored their importance
in predicting h-index for researchers in three different career phases. Also,
we examine the temporal dimension of predicting performance for different
feature categories to find out which features are more reliable for long- and
short-term prediction. We referred to the gender of the authors to examine the
role of this author's characteristics in the prediction task. Our findings
showed that gender has a very slight effect in predicting the h-index. We found
that non-impact-based features are more robust predictors for younger scholars
than seniors in the short term. Also, prior impact-based features lose their
power to predict more than other features in the long-term.

features of the anchor-free one-stage detector, in this paper, we find that
negative transfer may occur because the feature distribution varies depending
on the regression value for the offset to the bounding box as well as the
category. To obtain domain invariance by addressing this issue, we align the
feature conditioned on the offset value, considering the modality of the
feature distribution. With a very simple and effective conditioning method, we
propose OADA (Offset-Aware Domain Adaptive object detector) that achieves
state-of-the-art performances in various experimental settings. In addition, by
analyzing through singular value decomposition, we find that our model enhances
both discriminability and transferability.

novel techniques and perspectives. A major contributor to the difficulty of
containing the current pandemic is due to the highly asymptomatic nature of the
disease. In this investigation, we develop a modeling framework to study the
spatio-temporal evolution of diseases with high rates of asymptomatic
transmission, and we apply this framework to a hypothetical country with
mathematically tractable geography; namely, square counties uniformly organized
into a rectangle. We first derive a model for the temporal dynamics of
susceptible, infected, and recovered populations, which is applied at the
county level. Next we use likelihood-based parameter estimation to derive
temporally varying disease transmission parameters on the state-wide level.
While these two methods give us some spatial structure and show the effects of
behavioral and policy changes, they miss the evolution of hot zones that have
caused significant difficulties in resource allocation during the current
pandemic. It is evident that the distribution of cases will not be stagnantly
based on the population density, as with many other diseases, but will
continuously evolve. We model this as a diffusive process where the diffusivity
is spatially varying based on the population distribution, and temporally
varying based on the current number of simulated asymptomatic cases. With this
final addition coupled to the SIR model with temporally varying transmission
parameters, we capture the evolution of ""hot zones"" in our hypothetical setup.

Due to the dimer approximation of Hessian in saddle dynamics, the local

remains challenges for delicate analysis, such as the the boundedness of the
solutions and the dimer error. We address these issues to bound the solutions
under proper relaxation parameters, based on which we prove the error estimates

optimization to the design of such structures. We start by constructing a
variational model of an elastic-plastic material enriched with gradient
phase-field damage, and present a novel method to efficiently compute its

an augmented Lagrangian formulation, splitting the operator coupling between

computed through the adjoint method, resulting in an adjoint problem which we
solve in a similar manner to the forward dynamics. We demonstrate this
formulation by studying the optimal design of 2D solid-void structures
undergoing blast loading. Then, we explore the trade-offs between strength and
toughness in the design of a spall-resistant structure composed of two

Deepfake detection models indicate real/fake images based on visual concepts

Trees (GBDT) for a wide range of machine learning applications. Generally, a
consensus about GBDT's training algorithms is gradients and statistics are
computed based on high-precision floating points. In this paper, we investigate
an essentially important question which has been largely ignored by the
previous literature: how many bits are needed for representing gradients in
training GBDT? To solve this mystery, we propose to quantize all the
high-precision gradients in a very simple yet effective way in the GBDT's
training algorithm. Surprisingly, both our theoretical analysis and empirical
studies show that the necessary precisions of gradients without hurting any
performance can be quite low, e.g., 2 or 3 bits. With low-precision gradients,
most arithmetic operations in GBDT training can be replaced by integer
operations of 8, 16, or 32 bits. Promisingly, these findings may pave the way
for much more efficient training of GBDT from several aspects: (1) speeding up
the computation of gradient statistics in histograms; (2) compressing the
communication cost of high-precision statistical information during distributed
training; (3) the inspiration of utilization and development of hardware
architectures which well support low-precision computation for GBDT training.
Benchmarked on CPUs, GPUs, and distributed clusters, we observe up to 2$\times$
speedup of our simple quantization strategy compared with SOTA GBDT systems on
extensive datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of the
low-precision training of GBDT. The code will be released to the official

into a number of packets to pursue a low transmission rate based on the
delicate design of contents cached into users and broadcast messages. However,
the implementation complexity of this scheme increases with the number of
packets. It is desirable to design a scheme with a small subpacketization level
and a relatively low transmission rate. Recently, placement delivery array
(PDA) was proposed to address the subpacketization bottleneck of coded caching.
This paper investigates the design PDA from a new perspective, i.e., the
injective arc coloring of regular digraphs. It is shown that the injective arc
coloring of a regular digraph can yield a PDA with the same number of rows and
columns. Based on this, a new class of regular digraphs are defined and the
upper bounds on the injective chromatic index of such digraphs are derived.
Consequently, some new coded caching schemes with a linear subpacketization

model reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the range of clinical CESM
diagnostic results. Conclusion: This CAD is the first development of a lesion
detection and classification model for CESM images. Trained on a large dataset,
it has the potential to be used for helping the management of biopsy decision
and for helping the radiologist detecting complex lesions that could modify the

  Determination for Robust Sparse Brain Activity Decoding",,,,,"cs.LG q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent studies have utilized sparse classifications to predict categorical
variables from high-dimensional brain activity signals to expose human's
intentions and mental states, selecting the relevant features automatically in
the model training process. However, existing sparse classification models will
likely be prone to the performance degradation which is caused by noise
inherent in the brain recordings. To address this issue, we aim to propose a
new robust and sparse classification algorithm in this study. To this end, we
introduce the correntropy learning framework into the automatic relevance
determination based sparse classification model, proposing a new
correntropy-based robust sparse logistic regression algorithm. To demonstrate
the superior brain activity decoding performance of the proposed algorithm, we
evaluate it on a synthetic dataset, an electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset, and
a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. The extensive
experimental results confirm that not only the proposed method can achieve
higher classification accuracy in a noisy and high-dimensional classification
task, but also it would select those more informative features for the decoding
scenarios. Integrating the correntropy learning approach with the automatic
relevance determination technique will significantly improve the robustness
with respect to the noise, leading to more adequate robust sparse brain
decoding algorithm. It provides a more powerful approach in the real-world
brain activity decoding and the brain-computer interfaces.

we propose leveraging classification as a guidance signal for refining

alters the eigenstates from extended to localized ones. While these changes of
the charge distribution are characterized by neither multifractality nor
translational-symmetry breaking, they are characterized by hyperuniformity

as a first-order phase transition except for an electron-hole symmetric point,

Photometry data have been gathered from the literature to construct SEDs and to
determine pulsational variability. Radiative transfer models have been used to
interpret the data. All stars in the sample were detected in at least one CO
line, and 8 objects were detected in 324 GHz continuum. Based on luminosity
criteria, the sample is divided into 17 objects that most likely lie within the
inner Galactic Bulge, and 5 objects that are most likely foreground objects.
The median luminosity of the inner-Galactic-Bulge objects, 5600 Lsun,

OH/IR stars descend from solar-type stars. The objects in this sub-sample are
further divided into two classes based on their SED characteristics: 11 objects
have SEDs that are well matched by models invoking dust envelopes extending
from a few stellar radii and outwards, while 6 objects are better modelled as
having detached dust envelopes with inner radii in the range 200-600 au and
warmer central stars. The former objects have periodic variability, while the
latter objects are predominantly non-periodic. The median gas-mass-loss rate,

Density Functional Theory (DFT). Specifically, inclusion of spin-orbit coupling

topological semimetallic phase. However, in presence of SOC, there is a phase
transition from the topological semimetal to the trivial semimetal when the
material is subjected to compressive strain ($\lt -7\%$). Subsequently, under
further increase of compressive strain ($\ge -7\%$), we find an opening of a
direct band gap at the $\Gamma$ point, driving the system from the trivial
semimetallic to the semiconducting state with changes in the sequence of bands.
In the absence of SOC, only transition from the metallic to the semiconducting
phase is noticed. Under tensile strain, the TbPtBi compound maintains its phase
as in the unstrained condition but with an increase in the hole pocket at the
Fermi level, both in the absence and presence of SOC. These tunable phase
transitions (especially as a fraction of strain) make this compound very
promising for application in various quantum devices such as highly sensitive

with image observations, where a single image only includes one view of the
scene, and it suffers from a lack of motion information and object occlusions.
In theory, providing multiple observations to the imitation learning agent will
lead to better performance. However, surprisingly people find that sometimes
imitation from observation histories performs worse than imitation from the
most recent observation. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon from the
information flow within the neural network perspective. We also propose a novel
imitation learning neural network architecture that does not suffer from this

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1908.09535",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The key challenge of sequence representation learning is to capture the
long-range temporal dependencies. Typical methods for supervised sequence
representation learning are built upon recurrent neural networks to capture
temporal dependencies. One potential limitation of these methods is that they
only model one-order information interactions explicitly between adjacent time
steps in a sequence, hence the high-order interactions between nonadjacent time
steps are not fully exploited. It greatly limits the capability of modeling the
long-range temporal dependencies since the temporal features learned by
one-order interactions cannot be maintained for a long term due to temporal
information dilution and gradient vanishing. To tackle this limitation, we
propose the Non-local Recurrent Neural Memory (NRNM) for supervised sequence
representation learning, which performs non-local operations \MR{by means of
self-attention mechanism} to learn full-order interactions within a sliding
temporal memory block and models global interactions between memory blocks in a
gated recurrent manner. Consequently, our model is able to capture long-range
dependencies. Besides, the latent high-level features contained in high-order
interactions can be distilled by our model. We validate the effectiveness and
generalization of our NRNM on three types of sequence applications across
different modalities, including sequence classification, step-wise sequential

Engineering the factory automation process in such a way that return of

of paramount importance. Simulation can be a game changer in this scenario but
requires advanced programming skills that domain experts and industrial
designers might not have. In this paper we present the preliminary design and
implementation of a general-purpose framework for creating and exploiting
Virtual Environments via Natural language Agents (VEsNA). VEsNA takes advantage
of agent-based technologies and natural language processing to enhance the
design of virtual environments. The natural language input provided to VEsNA is
understood by a chatbot and passed to a cognitive intelligent agent that
implements the logic behind displacing objects in the virtual environment. In
the VEsNA vision, the intelligent agent will be able to reason on this
displacement and on its compliance to legal and normative constraints. It will
also be able to implement what-if analysis and case-based reasoning. Objects
populating the virtual environment will include active objects and will
populate a dynamic simulation whose outcomes will be interpreted by the
cognitive agent; explanations and suggestions will be passed back to the user
by the chatbot.

First, the AI must understand each skill's impact on the world. Second, we must

The
exact properties and origin of these magnetic fields are still uncertain even
though these fields play a key role in many astrophysical processes. Various
attempts have been made to derive the magnetic field strength and structure of
nearby galaxy clusters using Faraday rotation of extended cluster radio
sources. This approach needs to make various assumptions that could be
circumvented when using background radio sources. However, because the number
of polarised radio sources behind clusters is low, at the moment such a study
can only be done statistically. In this paper, we investigate the
depolarisation of radio sources inside and behind clusters in a sample of 124
massive clusters at $z<0.35$ observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array.
We detect a clear depolarisation trend with the cluster impact parameter, with
sources at smaller projected distances to the cluster centre showing more
depolarisation. By combining the radio observations with ancillary X-ray data
from Chandra, we compare the observed depolarisation with expectations from
cluster magnetic field models using individual cluster density profiles. The
best-fitting models have a central magnetic field strength of $5-10\,\mu$G with
power-law indices between $n=1$ and $n=4$. We find no strong difference in the
depolarisation trend between sources embedded in clusters and background
sources located at similar projected radii, although the central region of
clusters is still poorly probed by background sources. We also examine the
depolarisation trend as a function of cluster properties such as the dynamical
state, mass, and redshift. Our findings show that the statistical
depolarisation of radio sources is a good probe of cluster magnetic field
parameters. [abridged]

distribution as function of temperature, supports the existence of a BKT phase
in a range of temperature mediating the ordered ferroelectric (stable at low
$T$), and the disordered paraelectric phase that appears beyond a critical
temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$. This BKT phase is characterized by quasi-long-range
order (whose signature is a power-law decay of the correlations with the

other samples. However, these approaches require sufficiently well-spread
samples for accurate representation which might not be necessarily accessible

generalization power of deep neural networks. We propose two subspace

whose end-points can lie anywhere within, or on, the boundaries of the square.
We prove that such walks behave, asymptotically, as walks crossing a square
(WCAS), being those walks whose end-points lie at the south-east and north-west
corners of the square.
  We provide numerical data, enumerating all such walks, and analyse the
sequence of coefficients in order to estimate the asymptotic behaviour. We also
studied a subset of these walks, those that must contain at least one edge on
all four boundaries of the square. We provide compelling evidence that these
two classes of walks grow identically.
  From our analysis we conjecture that the number of such walks $C_L$, for both
problems, behaves as $$ C_L \sim \lambda^{L^2+bL+c}\cdot L^g,$$ where $\lambda=
1.7445498 \pm 0.0000012,$ $b=-0.04354 \pm 0.0005,$ $c=-1.35 \pm 0.45,$ and
$g=3.9 \pm 0.1.$
  Finally, we also studied the equivalent problem for self-avoiding polygons,
also known as cycles in a square grid. The asymptotic behaviour of cycles has
the same form as walks, but with different values of the parameters $c$, and
$g$. Our numerical analysis shows that $\lambda$ and $b$ have the same values
as for WCAS and that $c=1.776 \pm 0.002$ while $g=-0.500\pm 0.005$ and hence
probably equals $-\frac12$.

a content-based audio retrieval method that can retrieve a target audio that is
similar to but slightly different from the query audio by introducing auxiliary
textual information which describes the difference between the query and target

to audio that is similar to the query audio, the proposed method can adjust the
retrieval range by adding an embedding of the auxiliary text query-modifier to
the embedding of the query sample audio in a shared latent space. To evaluate
our method, we built a dataset comprising two different audio clips and the
text that describes the difference. The experimental results show that the
proposed method retrieves the paired audio more accurately than the baseline.
We also confirmed based on visualization that the proposed method obtains the
shared latent space in which the audio difference and the corresponding text

room response can have a distinct influence on the auditory perception of a

thus are used for direction-dependent room acoustic analysis and virtual
acoustic rendering. This work proposes a subspace method that decomposes SRIRs
into a direct part, which comprises the direct sound and the salient
reflections, and a residual, to facilitate enhanced analysis and rendering
methods by providing individual access to these components. The proposed method
is based on the generalized singular value decomposition and interprets the
residual as noise that is to be separated from the other components of the
reverberation. Large generalized singular values are attributed to the direct
part, which is then obtained as a low-rank approximation of the SRIR. By
advancing from the end of the SRIR toward the beginning while iteratively
updating the residual estimate, the method adapts to spatio-temporal variations
of the residual. The method is evaluated using a spatio-spectral error measure
and simulated SRIRs of different rooms, microphone arrays, and ratios of direct
sound to residual energy. The proposed method creates lower errors than
existing approaches in all tested scenarios, including a scenario with two
simultaneous reflections. A case study with measured SRIRs shows the

curves observed at large radii in the equatorial plane of disk galaxies can be
explained as a manifestation of General Relativity instead of the effect of
Dark Matter halos. In this paper, by using the well known weak field, low
velocity gravitomagnetic formulation of GR, the expected rotation curves in GR
are rigorously obtained for purely baryonic disk models with realistic density
profiles, and compared with the predictions of newtonian gravity for the same
disks in absence of Dark Matter. As expected, the resulting rotation curves are
indistinguishable, with GR corrections at all radii of the order of
$v^2/c^2\approx 10^{-6}$. Next, the gravitomagnetic Jeans equations for
two-integral stellar systems are derived, and then solved for the
Miyamoto-Nagai disk model, showing that finite-thickness effects do not change
the previous conclusions. Therefore, the observed phenomenology of galactic
rotation curves at large radii requires Dark Matter in GR exactly as in
newtonian gravity, unless the cases here explored are reconsidered in the full
GR framework with substantially different results (with the surprising
consequence that the weak field approximation of GR cannot be applied to the
study of rotating systems in the weak field regime). In the paper, the
mathematical framework is described in detail, so that the present study can be
extended to other disk models, or to elliptical galaxies (where Dark Matter is
also required in newtonian gravity, but their rotational support can be much
less than in disk galaxies).

meaningful directions corresponding to human-interpretable image
transformations. However, until now, their exploration for medical images has
been limited due to the requirement of supervised data. Several methods for
unsupervised discovery of interpretable directions in GAN latent spaces have
shown interesting results on natural images. This work explores the potential
of applying these techniques on medical images by training a GAN and a VAE on
thoracic CT scans and using an unsupervised method to discover interpretable
directions in the resulting latent space. We find several directions
corresponding to non-trivial image transformations, such as rotation or breast
size. Furthermore, the directions show that the generative models capture 3D

unsupervised methods to discover interpretable directions in GANs generalize to
VAEs and can be applied to medical images. This opens a wide array of future
work using these methods in medical image analysis.

non-concatenated ring polymers in melt conditions describe each ring as a
tree-like double-folded object. While evidence from simulations supports this
picture on a single ring level, other works show pairs of rings also thread
each other - a feature overlooked in the tree theories. Here we reconcile this
dichotomy using Monte-Carlo simulations of the ring melts with different
bending rigidity. We find that rings are double-folded (more strongly for
stiffer rings) on and above the entanglement length scale, while the threadings
are localized on smaller scales. The different theories disagree on the details
of the tree structure, i.e the fractal dimension of the backbone of the tree.
In the stiffer melts we find an indication of a self-avoiding scaling of the
backbone, while more flexible chains do not exhibit such a regime. Moreover,
the theories commonly neglect threadings, and assign different importance to
the impact of the progressive constraint release (tube dilation) on single ring
relaxation due to the motion of other rings. Despite each threading creates
only a small opening in the double-folded structure, the threading loops can be
numerous and their length can exceed substantially the entanglement scale. We
link the threading constraints to the divergence of the relaxation time of a
ring, if the tube dilation is hindered by pinning a fraction of other rings in
space. Current theories do not predict such divergence and predict faster than
measured diffusion of rings, pointing at the relevance of the threading
constraints in unpinned systems as well. Revision of the theories with explicit
threading constraints might elucidate the validity of the conjectured existence
of topological glass.

atmospheres was proven to provide precise experimental control of the size of
the supported Pt nanoparticles, and, correspondingly, control of catalyst
activity and stability. Based on dedicated surface science experiments,
ab-initio calculations and kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations we demonstrate that
the morphology of Pt nanoparticle population on ceria surface is a result of a
competition for Pt atoms between Pt single-atom sites and Pt nanoparticles. In
oxidizing atmosphere, Pt single-atom sites provide strong bonding to single Pt
atoms and Pt nanoparticles shrink. In reducing atmosphere, Pt single atom sites
are depopulated and Pt nanoparticles grow. We formulate a generic model of Pt
redispersion and coarsening on ceria substrates. Our model provides a unified
atomic-level explanation for a variety of metal nanoparticle dynamic processes
observed in single-atom catalysts under stationary or alternating
oxidizing/reducing atmospheres, and allows to classify the conditions when
nanoparticle ensembles on single-atom catalysts substrates can be stabilized
against Ostwald ripening.

discs around young stars, based on the published literature on this topic in
the last 30 years. Since most stars $\leq~2$ Myr old harbour protoplanetary
discs, tidal perturbations affect planet formation. First, we examine the
probability of experiencing flybys or encounters: More than 50\% of stars with
planet-forming discs in a typical star forming environment should experience a
close stellar encounter or flyby within 1000 au. Second, we detail the
dynamical effects of flybys on planet-forming discs. Prograde, parabolic,
disc-penetrating flybys are the most destructive. Grazing and penetrating
flybys in particular lead to the capture of disc material by the secondary to
form a highly misaligned circumsecondary disc with respect to the disc around
the primary. One or both discs may undergo extreme accretion and outburst
events, similar to the ones observed in FU Orionis-type stars. Warps and broken
discs are distinct signatures of retrograde flybys. Third, we review some
recently observed stellar systems with discs where a stellar flyby or an
encounter is suspected -- including UX Tau, RW Aur, AS 205, Z CMa, and FU Ori.
Finally, we discuss the implications of stellar flybys for planet formation and
exoplanet demographics, including possible imprints of a flyby in the Solar
System in the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects and the Sun's obliquity.

the macroscopic mechanical response of elastomers filled with liquid inclusions
in the setting of small quasistatic deformations. The derivation is carried out
for materials with periodic microstructure by means of a two-scale asymptotic
analysis. The focus is on the non-dissipative case when the elastomer is an
elastic solid, the liquid making up the inclusions is an elastic fluid, the
interfaces separating the solid elastomer from the liquid inclusions are
elastic interfaces featuring an initial surface tension, and the inclusions are
initially $n$-spherical ($n=2,3$) in shape. Remarkably, in spite of the
presence of local residual stresses within the inclusions due to an initial
surface tension at the interfaces, the macroscopic response of such filled
elastomers turns out to be that of a linear elastic solid that is free of
residual stresses and hence one that is simply characterized by an effective
modulus of elasticity $\bar{\textbf{L}}$. What is more, in spite of the fact
that the local moduli of elasticity in the bulk and the interfaces do not
possess minor symmetries (due to the presence of residual stresses and the
initial surface tension at the interfaces), the resulting effective modulus of
elasticity $\bar{\textbf{L}}$ does possess the standard minor symmetries of a
conventional linear elastic solid, that is,
$\bar{L}_{ijkl}=\bar{L}_{jikl}=\bar{L}_{ijlk}$. As a first application,
numerical results are worked out and analyzed for the effective modulus of

architecture for classification tasks. The penalty of spikes-based encoding has
been the lack of a universal training mechanism performed entirely using
spikes. There have been several attempts to adopt the powerful backpropagation
(BP) technique used in non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANN): (1) SNNs
can be trained by externally computed numerical gradients. (2) A major
advancement toward native spike-based learning has been the use of approximate
Backpropagation using spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) with phased
forward/backward passes. However, the transfer of information between such
phases necessitates external memory and computational access. This is a
challenge for neuromorphic hardware implementations. In this paper, we propose
a stochastic SNN-based Back-Prop (SSNN-BP) algorithm that utilizes a composite
neuron to simultaneously compute the forward pass activations and backward pass
gradients explicitly with spikes. Although signed gradient values are a
challenge for spike-based representation, we tackle this by splitting the
gradient signal into positive and negative streams. The composite neuron
encodes information in the form of stochastic spike-trains and converts
Backpropagation weight updates into temporally and spatially local discrete
STDP-like spike coincidence updates compatible with hardware-friendly Resistive
Processing Units (RPUs). Furthermore, our method approaches BP ANN baseline
with sufficiently long spike-trains. Finally, we show that softmax
cross-entropy loss function can be implemented through inhibitory lateral
connections enforcing a Winner Take All (WTA) rule. Our SNN shows excellent
generalization through comparable performance to ANNs on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST and Extended MNIST datasets. Thus, SSNN-BP enables BP compatible

linear constant-coefficient reaction-diffusion equation on n-balls (in
particular, disks and spheres) has been solved by means of the backstepping
method. However, the extension of this result to spatially-varying coefficients
is far from trivial. Some early success has been achieved under simplifying
conditions, such as radially-varying reaction coefficients under revolution
symmetry, on a disk or a sphere. These particular cases notwithstanding, the
problem remains open. The main issue is that the equations become singular in
the radius; when applying the backstepping method, the same type of singularity
appears in the kernel equations. Traditionally, well-posedness of these
equations has been proved by transforming them into integral equations and then
applying the method of successive approximations. In this case, with the
resulting integral equation becoming singular, successive approximations do not
easily apply. This paper takes a different route and directly addresses the
kernel equations via a power series approach, finding in the process the
required conditions for the radially-varying reaction (namely, analyticity and
evenness) and showing the existence and convergence of the series solution.
This approach provides a direct numerical method that can be readily applied,
despite singularities, to both control and observer boundary design problems.

focus on devising algorithms at the feature level while little attention is
paid to processing input video data. Moreover, existing frame sampling
strategies may omit critical action information in temporal and spatial
dimensions, which further impacts video utilization efficiency. In this paper,
we propose a novel video frame sampler for few-shot action recognition to
address this issue, where task-specific spatial-temporal frame sampling is
achieved via a temporal selector (TS) and a spatial amplifier (SA).
Specifically, our sampler first scans the whole video at a small computational
cost to obtain a global perception of video frames. The TS plays its role in
selecting top-T frames that contribute most significantly and subsequently. The
SA emphasizes the discriminative information of each frame by amplifying
critical regions with the guidance of saliency maps. We further adopt
task-adaptive learning to dynamically adjust the sampling strategy according to
the episode task at hand. Both the implementations of TS and SA are
differentiable for end-to-end optimization, facilitating seamless integration
of our proposed sampler with most few-shot action recognition methods.

benchmarks including long-term videos.The code is available at

  Cross-domain 3D Action Recognition","Accepted by ECCV2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we consider the problem of cross-domain 3D action recognition
in the open-set setting, which has been rarely explored before. Specifically,
there is a source domain and a target domain that contain the skeleton
sequences with different styles and categories, and our purpose is to cluster
the target data by utilizing the labeled source data and unlabeled target data.
For such a challenging task, this paper presents a novel approach dubbed CoDT
to collaboratively cluster the domain-shared features and target-specific
features. CoDT consists of two parallel branches. One branch aims to learn
domain-shared features with supervised learning in the source domain, while the
other is to learn target-specific features using contrastive learning in the
target domain. To cluster the features, we propose an online clustering
algorithm that enables simultaneous promotion of robust pseudo label generation
and feature clustering. Furthermore, to leverage the complementarity of
domain-shared features and target-specific features, we propose a novel
collaborative clustering strategy to enforce pair-wise relationship consistency
between the two branches. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple
cross-domain 3D action recognition datasets, and the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

for the examination of gastrointestinal tracts. An intelligent computer-aided
diagnostic system for detecting gastrointestinal abnormalities like polyp,
bleeding, inflammation, etc. is highly exigent in wireless capsule endoscopy
image analysis. Abnormalities greatly differ in their shape, size, color, and
texture, and some appear to be visually similar to normal regions. This poses a
challenge in designing a binary classifier due to intra-class variations. In
this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network is proposed for abnormality
detection that extracts a rich pool of meaningful features from wireless
capsule endoscopy images using a variety of convolution operations. It consists
of three parallel convolutional neural networks, each with a distinctive
feature learning capability. The first network utilizes depthwise separable
convolution, while the second employs cosine normalized convolution operation.
A novel meta-feature extraction mechanism is introduced in the third network,
to extract patterns from the statistical information drawn over the features
generated from the first and second networks and its own previous layer. The
network trio effectively handles intra-class variance and efficiently detects
gastrointestinal abnormalities. The proposed hybrid convolutional neural
network model is trained and tested on two widely used publicly available
datasets. The test results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms six
state-of-the-art methods with 97\% and 98\% classification accuracy on KID and
Kvasir-Capsule datasets respectively. Cross dataset evaluation results also
demonstrate the generalization performance of the proposed model.

increases its variability when the size of the cells is increased.
Nevertheless, the shape of the distributions is kept constant, which allows us
to introduce a scaling law, analogous to finite-size scaling, with a scaling
function reasonably well fitted by a gamma distribution. This means that the
distribution of the number of inhabitants per cell is stable or invariant under
addition with neighboring cells (plus rescaling), defying the central-limit
theorem, due to the obvious dependence of the random variables. The finite-size
scaling implies a power-law relations between the moments of the distribution
and its scale parameter, which are found to be related with the fractal
properties of the spatial pattern formed by the population. The match between
theoretical predictions and empirical results is reasonably good.

faithful driving to enable dynamically synthesized appearance that is

framework that addresses two core challenges in modeling and driving full-body
avatars of real people. One challenge is driving an avatar while staying
faithful to details and dynamics that cannot be captured by a global
low-dimensional parameterization such as body pose. Our approach supports
driving of clothed avatars with wrinkles and motion that a real driving
performer exhibits beyond the training corpus. Unlike existing global state
representations or non-parametric screen-space approaches, we introduce
texel-aligned features -- a localised representation which can leverage both
the structural prior of a skeleton-based parametric model and observed sparse
image signals at the same time. Another challenge is modeling a temporally
coherent clothed avatar, which typically requires precise surface tracking. To
circumvent this, we propose a novel volumetric avatar representation by
extending mixtures of volumetric primitives to articulated objects. By
explicitly incorporating articulation, our approach naturally generalizes to
unseen poses. We also introduce a localized viewpoint conditioning, which leads
to a large improvement in generalization of view-dependent appearance. The
proposed volumetric representation does not require high-quality mesh tracking
as a prerequisite and brings significant quality improvements compared to
mesh-based counterparts. In our experiments, we carefully examine our design
choices and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming the
state-of-the-art methods on challenging driving scenarios.

model for images. Since Gaussian convolution is equivalent to homogeneous
diffusion filtering, one way to deblur such images is to diffuse them backwards
in time. However, backward diffusion is highly ill-posed. Thus, it requires
stabilisation in the model as well as highly sophisticated numerical
algorithms. Moreover, sharpening is often only desired across image edges but
not along them, since it may cause very irregular contours. This creates the
need to model a stabilised anisotropic backward evolution and to devise an
appropriate numerical algorithm for this ill-posed process.
  We address both challenges. First we introduce stabilised inverse flowline
evolution (SIFE) as an anisotropic image sharpening flow. Outside extrema, its
partial differential equation (PDE) is backward parabolic in gradient
direction. Interestingly, it is sufficient to stabilise it in extrema by
imposing a zero flow there. We show that morphological derivatives - which are
not common in the numerics of PDEs - are ideal for the numerical approximation
of SIFE: They effortlessly approximate directional derivatives in gradient
direction. Our scheme adapts one-sided morphological derivatives to the
underlying image structure. It allows to progress in subpixel accuracy and
enables us to prove stability properties. Our experiments show that SIFE allows
nonflat steady states and outperforms other sharpening flows.

Notably, vertices in the state $h$ cannot transition directly to $h'\neq h$ and
neighbouring $h'$-vacancies do not contribute in satisfying $c_x^{h}$. Thus,
there is a novel blocking mechanism between vacancies of differing type. We
find sufficient conditions on the model geometry to have a positive spectral

subdomains and need to put boundary conditions on the subdomain boundaries. In
domain truncation one restricts the unbounded domain to a bounded computational
domain and also needs to put boundary conditions on the computational domain
boundaries. It turns out to be fruitful to think of the domain decomposition in
Schwarz methods as truncation of the domain onto subdomains. The first truly
optimal Schwarz method that converges in a finite number of steps was proposed
in 1994 and used precisely transparent boundary conditions as transmission
conditions between subdomains. Approximating these transparent boundary
conditions for fast convergence of Schwarz methods led to the development of
optimized Schwarz methods -- a name that has become common for Schwarz methods
based on domain truncation. Compared to classical Schwarz methods which use
simple Dirichlet transmission conditions and have been successfully used in a
wide range of applications, optimized Schwarz methods are much less well
understood, mainly due to their more sophisticated transmission conditions.
This present situation is the motivation for our survey: to give a
comprehensive review and precise exploration of convergence behaviors of
optimized Schwarz methods based on Fourier analysis taking into account the
original boundary conditions, many subdomain decompositions and layered media.
The transmission conditions we study include the lowest order absorbing
conditions (Robin), and also more advanced perfectly matched layers (PML), both
developed first for domain truncation.

accreted ice determines the distribution of iron between the mantle (oxidized
FeO and FeO$_{1.5}$) and the core (metallic Fe and FeS). We find that an
initial primitive composition of ice-rich material leads, upon heating by the
decay of $^{26}$Al, to extensive water flow and the formation of clay minerals
inside planetesimals. Metallic iron dissolves in liquid water and precipitates
as oxidized magnetite Fe$_3$O$_4$. Further heating by $^{26}$Al destabilizes
the clay at a temperature of around 900 K. The released supercritical water
ejects the entire water content from the planetesimal. Upon reaching the
silicate melting temperature of 1,700 K, planetesimals further differentiate
into a core (made mainly of iron sulfide FeS) and a mantle with a high fraction
of oxidized iron. We propose that the asteroid Vesta's significant FeO fraction
in the mantle is a testimony of its original ice content. We consider Vesta to
be a surviving member of the population of protoplanets from which Mars, Earth,
and Venus grew by pebble accretion. We show that the increase in the core mass
fraction and decrease in FeO contents with increasing planetary mass (in the
sequence Vesta -- Mars -- Earth) is naturally explained by the growth of
terrestrial planets outside of the water ice line through accretion of pebbles
containing iron that was dominantly in metallic form with an intrinsically low
oxidation degree.

algorithm solving the problem was described by Mulmuley et al. Despite a lot of
effort, it is still not known today whether a deterministic polynomial-time

to test the popular conjecture that the complexity classes P and RP are equal.
In a recent article, progress was made towards this goal by showing that for
(bipartite) graphs of bounded (bipartite) independence number, a polynomial
time algorithm exists. In terms of parameterized complexity, this algorithm was
an XP-algorithm parameterized by the independence number. In this article, we
improve the techniques to obtain an FPT-algorithm for bipartite graphs. If the

where, through localized Joule heating within the pore volume, single-bubble
nucleation and transition are examined at nanosecond resolution using resistive
pulse sensing and acoustic sensing. Akin to macroscale boiling, where
heterogeneous bubbles can nucleate and coalesce into a film, in the case of
nanopores also, patches of heterogeneous bubbles nucleating on the cylindrical
pore surface can form a torus-shaped vapor film blanketing the entire pore
surface. In contrast to conventional pool boiling, nanopore boiling involves a
reverse transition mechanism, where, with increased heat generation, film
boiling reverts to nucleate boiling. With increasing bias voltage across the
nanopore, the Joule heat production increases within the pore, leading to
destabilization and collapse of the torus-shaped vapor film.

moderately segregated and non-segregated communities. We direct our attention
to the non-segregated and highly segregated communities, quantifying and

researchers within communities showing different segregation categories.
Researchers in highly segregated communities get more citations from their

and initially accrete 28\% water ice by mass. The accretion of water stops
after the protoplanet reaches a mass of $0.01\,M_{\rm E}$ where the gas
envelope becomes hot enough to sublimate the ice and transport the vapour back
to the protoplanetary disc by recycling flows. The energy released by the decay
of $^{26}$Al melts the accreted ice to form clay (phyllosilicates), oxidized
iron (FeO), and a water surface layer with ten times the mass of Earth's modern
oceans. The ocean--atmosphere system undergoes a run-away greenhouse effect
after the effective accretion temperature crosses a threshold of around 300 K.
The run-away greenhouse process vaporizes the water layer, thereby trapping the
accretion heat and heating the surface to more than 6,000 K. This causes the
upper part of the mantle to melt and form a global magma ocean. Metal melt
separates from silicate melt and sediments towards the bottom of the magma
ocean; the gravitational energy released by the sedimentation leads to positive
feedback where the beginning differentiation of the planet causes the whole
mantle to melt and differentiate. All rocky planets thus naturally experience a
magma ocean stage. We demonstrate that Earth's small excess of $^{182}$W (the
decay product of $^{182}$Hf) relative to the chondrites is consistent with such
rapid core formation within 5 Myr followed by equilibration of the W reservoir
in Earth's mantle with $^{182}$W-poor material from the core of a
planetary-mass impactor, provided that the equilibration degree is at least
25%-50%, depending on the initial Hf/W ratio. The planetary collision must have

$||i,j||_n$ to be the distance between $i$ and $j$ when the elements of
$\mathbb{Z}_n$ are written in a cycle. So $||i,j||_n=\min\{(i-j)\bmod

pair of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ to a pair at large distance. More
geometrically, the existence of an $(s,k)$-clash-free permutation is equivalent
to the existence of a set of $n$ non-overlapping $s\times k$ rectangles on an
$n\times n$ torus, whose centres have distinct integer $x$-coordinates and
distinct integer $y$-coordinates.
  For positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $k<n$, let $\sigma(n,k)$ be the
largest value of $s$ such that an $(s,k)$-clash-free permutation on

that \[ \lfloor (n-1)/k\rfloor-1\leq \sigma(n,k)\leq \lfloor (n-1)/k\rfloor \]
for all integers $n$ and $k$ with $k<n$. The paper establishes this conjecture,
by explicitly constructing an $(s,k)$-clash-free permutation on $\mathbb{Z}_n$
with $s=\lfloor (n-1)/k\rfloor-1$. Indeed, this construction is used to
establish a more general conjecture of Mammoliti and Simpson, where for some
fixed integer $r$ we require every point on the torus to be contained in the
interior of at most $r$ rectangles.

components of planetary atmospheres. In the pebble accretion model for rocky
planet formation, these volatile species are accreted during the main planetary
formation phase. For this study, we modelled the partitioning of volatiles
within a growing planet and the outgassing to the surface. The core stores more
than 90\% of the hydrogen and carbon budgets of Earth for realistic values of
the partition coefficients of H and C between metal and silicate melts. The
magma oceans of Earth and Venus are sufficiently deep to undergo oxidation of
ferrous Fe$^{2+}$ to ferric Fe$^{3+}$. This increased oxidation state leads to
the outgassing of primarily CO$_2$ and H$_2$O from the magma ocean of Earth. In
contrast, the oxidation state of Mars' mantle remains low and the main
outgassed hydrogen carrier is H$_2$. This hydrogen easily escapes the
atmosphere due to the irradiation from the young Sun in XUV wavelengths,
dragging with it the majority of the CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and N$_2$ contents of
the atmosphere. A small amount of surface water is maintained on Mars, in
agreement with proposed ancient ocean shorelines, for moderately low values of
the mantle oxidation. Nitrogen partitions relatively evenly between the core
and the atmosphere due to its extremely low solubility in magma; the burial of
large reservoirs of nitrogen in the core is thus not possible. The overall low
N contents of Earth disagree with the high abundance of N in all chondrite
classes and favours a volatile delivery by pebble snow. Our model of rapid
rocky planet formation by pebble accretion displays broad consistency with the
volatile contents of the Sun's terrestrial planets. The diversity of the
terrestrial planets can therefore be used as benchmark cases to calibrate
models of extrasolar rocky planets and their atmospheres.

flow invariants and applying a multi-step strategy. The proposed solutions
provide first-order corrections to the compact model in the form of integrals
of mean flow variables. An eigenvalue system is then built to predict the
thermoacoustic modes of a duct containing a distributed heat source or sink.
Predictions from the AE solutions agree well with the numerical results of the
linearised Euler equations for both frequencies and growth rates, as long as
the low-frequency condition is satisfied. The AE solutions are able to
accurately reconstruct the acoustic and entropy waves and correct the
significant errors in the predicted entropy wave associated with the compact

for the entropy wave generated by the interaction of acoustic wave and the
distributed steady heat source, especially when density- or entropy-dependent
boundary conditions are prescribed at the duct ends. Furthermore, a combination
of the AE method and the modified WKB approximation method is discussed for a
cooling case. The AE solutions remedy the disadvantage of the WKB solution in
the low and very low-frequency domain and facilitate full-frequency theoretical

heteropolymer system where the number of monomer species is as large as the
total number of monomers, is studied by means of computer simulations. In this
study, we systematically explore the consequences of having different
functional form and variance of the energy distribution on the coil-globule
transition in general. In particular, considering Gaussian (G) and uniform (U)
distributions, the effect of varying polydispersity index, $\delta$, on the
transition temperature $\theta^\ast$, chain size, internal structure and
spatial organization of monomers in the globule, and kinetics of the folding
are addressed. It is found that the transition temperature of the model
heteropolymer is lower than that of the homopolymer counterpart, and
$\theta^\ast$ increases with $\delta$ (both G and U) and $\theta^\ast({\rm U})
< \theta^\ast({\rm G})$ consistently. The results of our study suggest that
$\theta^\ast$ is governed by the most probable value (rather than the width) of
the pair-wise energy distribution. Interestingly, the nature of the collapse
transition turns out to be universal, i.e., when scaled properly (irrespective
of the functional form and variance) all the swelling curves fall on a master
curve and it is well described by the same scaling form of the homopolymer
counterpart. However, following quenching, the transition from coil to globule
is relatively fast for heteropolymer (with no significant difference between G
and U systems, and no significant $\delta$ dependence within the considered
range). On the other hand, internal organization in the collapsed state,
quantified through mean contact probability, show distinct scaling regimes.
Also we observe segregation of monomers based on their identities which is more
pronounced in the case of uniform distribution.

executing complex tasks that require highly dexterous movements and critical
high-level intelligence. Classical teleoperation schemes are based on either
joystick control, or on more intuitive interfaces which map directly the user
arm motions into one robot arm's motions. These approaches have limits when the
execution of a given task requires reconfigurable multiple robotic arm systems.
Indeed, the simultaneous teleoperation of two or more robot arms could extend
the workspace of the manipulation cell, or increase its total payload, or
afford other advantages. In different phases of a reconfigurable multi-arm
system, each robot could act as an independent arm, or as one of a pair of
cooperating arms, or as one of the fingers of a virtual, large robot hand. This
manuscript proposes a novel telemanipulation framework that enables both the
individual and combined control of any number of robotic arms. Thanks to the
designed control architecture, the human operator can intuitively choose the
proposed control modalities and the manipulators that make the task convenient
to execute through the user interface. Moreover, through the tele-impedance
paradigm, the system can address complex tasks that require physical
interaction by letting the robot mimic the arm impedance and position
references of the human operator. The proposed framework is validated with 8
subjects controlling 4 Franka Emika Panda robots with 7-DoFs to execute a
telemanipulation task. Qualitative results of the experiments show us the
promising applicability of our framework.

14}, 1903 (2018)]. This model describes ballistic aggregation of patchy
colloids and depends on a parameter $r_\mathrm{AB}$ which controls the affinity
of the two patches, A and B. Suitable boundary conditions allow us to elucidate
a discontinuous pinning-depinning transition at $r_\mathrm{AB}=0$, with the
front displaying intrinsic anomalous scaling, but with unusual exponent values
$\alpha \simeq 1.2$, $\alpha_{\rm loc} \simeq 0.5$, $\beta\simeq 1$, and
$z\simeq 1.2$. For $0<r_\mathrm{AB}\le 1$, comparison with simulations of
standard off-lattice ballistic deposition indicates the occurrence of a
morphological instability induced by the patch structure. As a result, we find
that the asymptotic morphological behavior is dominated by macroscopic shapes.
The intermediate time regime exhibits one-dimensional KPZ exponents for
$r_\mathrm{AB}> 0.01$ and the system suffers a strong crossover dominated by
the $r_\mathrm{AB}=0$ behavior for $r_\mathrm{AB}\le 0.01$. A detailed analysis
of correlation functions shows that the aggregate fronts are always in the
moving phase for $0<r_\mathrm{AB}\le 1$ and that their kinetic roughening
behavior is intrinsically anomalous for $r_\mathrm{AB}\le 0.01$.

threshold effects and the respective decoupling of ultraviolet degrees of
freedom. Standard Model and gravity couplings and masses are fixed by their
experimental low energy values. Importantly, we accommodate for the difference
between the top pole mass and its Euclidean analogue. Both, the correct mass
determination and the threshold effects have a significant impact on the
qualitative properties, and in particular on the stability properties of the
specific ultraviolet-infrared trajectory with experimental Standard Model
physics in the infrared. We show that in the present rather advanced
approximation the matter part of the asymptotically safe Standard Model has the

AN structure is very challenging in downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wiretap channels with multiple eavesdroppers. The
major challenge in maximizing the secrecy rate arises from the non-convexity
and non-smoothness of the rate function. Traditionally, an alternating
optimization framework that identifies beamforming vectors and AN covariance
matrix has been adopted; yet this alternating approach has limitations in
maximizing the secrecy rate. In this paper, we put forth a novel secure
precoding algorithm that jointly and simultaneously optimizes the beams and AN
covariance matrix for maximizing the secrecy rate when a transmitter has either
perfect or partial channel knowledge of eavesdroppers. To this end, we first
establish an approximate secrecy rate in a smooth function. Then, we derive the
first-order optimality condition in the form of the nonlinear eigenvalue
problem (NEP). We present a computationally efficient algorithm to identify the
principal eigenvector of the NEP as a suboptimal solution for secure precoding.
Simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods improve secrecy rate
significantly compared to the existing secure precoding methods.

Nevertheless,
their origin, evolution and implications are still largely unknown. It is
generally assumed that bulk motions are a relatively recent addition to the
universal kinematics, triggered by the increasing inhomogeneity and anisotropy
of the post-recombination epoch. In this work, we focus on the linear evolution
of peculiar velocities prior to recombination, namely in the late radiation era
and also during a phase of de Sitter inflation. We begin by showing/confirming
that bulk motions are triggered and sustained by the non-gravitational forces
developed during structure formation. Since density and therefore
peculiar-velocity perturbations cannot grow in the baryonic sector before
recombination, we consider drift motions in non-baryonic species, which can
start growing in the late radiation era. Using relativistic linear cosmological
perturbation theory, we find that peculiar motions in the low-energy dark
component exhibit power-law growth, which increases further after
equipartition. Turning to the very early universe, we consider the evolution of
linear peculiar velocities during a phase of de Sitter inflation. We find that
typical slow-roll scenarios do not source peculiar motions. Moreover, even if
the latter were to be present at the onset of the de Sitter phase, the
subsequent exponential expansion should quickly wash away any traces of
peculiar-velocity perturbations.

means to understand the dynamics in crowded and complex environments. In this
study, the dynamics of tracer particles in the matrix of dense soft-colloidal
suspensions in fluid phase is studied by means of dissipative particle dynamics
simulations. By considering relatively large tracer (three times that of
colloid) we systematically explore the interplay between the environment in
which the tracer undergoes motion and interaction with the environment on the
dynamics for temperatures close to the thermodynamic freezing transition where
the effect of pair-wise interaction is significant compared to thermal energy.
To this end we consider three fluid systems differing in the degree of softness
(i.e., ultra-soft, intermediate, and hard) of the constituent colloidal
particles, also change tracer types in the sense that we vary the degree of
softness of the tracer w.r.t. colloids from ultra-soft to very hard. It is
found that for tracer in ultra-soft colloidal fluid, at long times, the motion
is diffusive for all tracer types, however the relaxation time (or diffusion
constant) increases (or decreases) with increasing hardness of tracer at a
given temperature. Interestingly, for tracer in hard colloidal fluid, the
motion changes from a free diffusion (continuous trajectory) to that of hopping
where there is intermittent jumps following a long period of localized
vibrations and consequently displacement distribution function show higher
order peaks indicating different dynamics at different time (or length) scales.

One such phenomenon is the emergence of the elusive $pi/2$ modes, i.e., a type
of topological boundary state pinned at a quarter of the driving frequency. The
latter may lead to the formation of Floquet parafermions in the presence of
interaction, which is known to support more computational power than Majorana

is more prominent on the nightside compared to the dayside ionosphere. During

Previous part-based methods for human reconstruction rely on ground-truth part
labels from SMPL and thus are limited to minimal-clothed humans. In contrast,
our method learns to separate parts from body motions instead of part
supervision, thus can be extended to clothed humans and other articulated
objects. Our Partition-from-Motion is achieved by a bone-centered
initialization, a bone limit loss, and a section normal loss that ensure stable
part division even when the training poses are limited. We also present a
minimal perimeter loss for SDF to suppress extra surfaces and part overlapping.
Another core of our method is an adjacent part seaming algorithm that produces
non-rigid deformations to maintain the connection between parts which
significantly relieves the part-based artifacts. Under this algorithm, we
further propose ""Competing Parts"", a method that defines blending weights by
the relative position of a point to bones instead of the absolute position,
avoiding the generalization problem of neural implicit functions with inverse
LBS (linear blend skinning). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by
clothed human body reconstruction and animation on the CAPE and the ClothSeq

addition, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \geq$ 11.5 GeV, the measured proton $\kappa_{n}$,
within uncertainties, does not support the two-component shape of proton
distributions that would be expected from a first-order phase transition. Taken
in combination, the hyper-order proton number fluctuations suggest that the

processing is performed to extract the flow structures and the instability
modes. Additional numerical simulations are performed to help classify the
observed flow structures. Unsteady flow structures such as over-tip shock
oscillation, shear-layer flapping, and vortex shedding are revealed by Fourier
analysis and dynamic mode decomposition. The results show that, under subsonic
conditions, the trigger position of the shear layer instability is
monotonically delayed as the blade loading increases; however, this pattern is
reversed under transonic conditions. This implies that flow compressibility,
flow acceleration, and the oscillation of over-tip shock waves are critical
factors related to tip flow instabilities. The over-tip shock waves are
observed to be locked-in by frequency and position with the shear-layer
flapping mode. An intermittent flow mode, termed the escaping vortex-shedding

a seller of $m$ items, facing a single buyer with valuation $v$. We observe
that previous attempts to define complexity measures often fail to classify
mechanisms that are intuitively considered simple (e.g., the ""selling
separately"" mechanism) as such. We suggest to view a menu as simple if a bundle
that maximizes the buyer's profit can be found by conducting a few primitive
operations that are considered simple. The \emph{primitive complexity of a
menu} is the number of primitive operations needed to (adaptively) find a
profit-maximizing entry in the menu. In this paper, the primitive operation
that we study is essentially computing the outcome of the ""selling separately""
mechanism.
  Does the primitive complexity capture the simplicity of other auctions that
are intuitively simple? We consider \emph{bundle-size pricing}, a common
pricing method in which the price of a bundle depends only on its size. Our
main technical contribution is determining the primitive complexity of
bundle-size pricing menus in various settings. We show that for any
distribution $\cal D$ over weighted matroid rank valuations, even distributions
with arbitrary correlation among their values, there is always a bundle-size
pricing menu with low primitive complexity that achieves almost the same
revenue as the optimal bundle-size pricing menu. As part of this proof we
provide a randomized algorithm that for any weighted matroid rank valuation $v$
and integer $k$, finds the most valuable set of size $k$ with only a
poly-logarithmic number of demand and value queries. We show that this result
is essentially tight in several aspects. For example, if the valuation $v$ is
submodular, then finding the most valuable set of size $k$ requires
exponentially many queries (this solves an open question of Badanidiyuru et al.

GAN models to perform image editing by leveraging the semantic hierarchy
present in the layers of the generator. We present Few-shot Latent-based
Attribute Manipulation and Editing (FLAME), a simple yet effective framework to
perform highly controlled image editing by latent space manipulation.
Specifically, we estimate linear directions in the latent space (of a
pre-trained StyleGAN) that controls semantic attributes in the generated image.
In contrast to previous methods that either rely on large-scale attribute
labeled datasets or attribute classifiers, FLAME uses minimal supervision of a
few curated image pairs to estimate disentangled edit directions. FLAME can
perform both individual and sequential edits with high precision on a diverse
set of images while preserving identity. Further, we propose a novel task of
Attribute Style Manipulation to generate diverse styles for attributes such as
eyeglass and hair. We first encode a set of synthetic images of the same
identity but having different attribute styles in the latent space to estimate
an attribute style manifold. Sampling a new latent from this manifold will
result in a new attribute style in the generated image. We propose a novel
sampling method to sample latent from the manifold, enabling us to generate a
diverse set of attribute styles beyond the styles present in the training set.
FLAME can generate diverse attribute styles in a disentangled manner. We
illustrate the superior performance of FLAME against previous image editing
methods by extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons. FLAME also
generalizes well on multiple datasets such as cars and churches.

various constraints, therefore bring additional computational challenges to
exact solution methods or heuristic search approaches. The recent idea to learn
heuristic move patterns from sample data has become increasingly promising to
reduce solution developing costs. However, using learning-based approaches to
address more types of constrained VRP remains a challenge. The difficulty lies
in controlling for constraint violations while searching for optimal solutions.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based method to
solve soft-constrained VRPs by incorporating the Lagrangian relaxation
technique and using constrained policy optimization. We apply the method on
three common types of VRPs, the Travelling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
(TSPTW), the Capacitated VRP (CVRP) and the Capacitated VRP with Time Windows
(CVRPTW), to show the generalizability of the proposed method. After comparing
to existing RL-based methods and open-source heuristic solvers, we demonstrate
its competitive performance in finding solutions with a good balance in travel
distance, constraint violations and inference speed.

low cost. So far however, their efficiencies cannot compete with traditional
inorganic multi-junction solar cells and they generally underperform in
comparison to what is expected from the isolated single junction devices.
Understanding performance losses in all-perovskite tandem solar cells is a
crucial aspect that will accelerate advancement. Here, we perform extensive
selective characterization of the individual sub-cells to disentangle the
different losses and limiting factors in these tandem devices. We find that
non-radiative losses in the high-gap subcell dominate the overall recombination
losses in our baseline system as well as in the majority of literature reports.
We consecutively improve the high-gap perovskite subcell through a
multi-faceted approach, allowing us to enhance the open-circuit voltage
($V_{OC}$) of the subcell by up to 120 mV. Due to the (quasi) lossless indium
oxide interconnect which we employ for the first time in all-perovskite
tandems, the $V_{OC}$ improvements achieved in the high-gap perovskites
translate directly to improved all-perovskite tandem solar cells with a
champion $V_{OC}$ of 2.00 V and a stabilized efficiency of 23.7%. The
efficiency potential of our optimized all-perovskite tandems reaches 25.2% and
27.0% when determined from electro- and photo-luminescence respectively,
indicating significant transport losses as well as imperfect energy-alignment
between the perovskite and the transport layers in the experimental devices.
Further improvements to 28.4% are possible considering the bulk quality of both
absorbers measured using photo-luminescence on isolated perovskite layers. Our
insights therefore not only show an optimization example but a generalizable
evidence-based strategy for optimization utilizing optical sub-cell

distribution of peak tides to change over months and years. Skew surge-peak
tide dependence is accounted for via a tidal covariate in the GPD model and we
adjust for skew surge temporal dependence through the subasymptotic extremal
index. We incorporate spatial prior information in our GPD model to reduce the
uncertainty associated with the highest return level estimates. Our results are
an improvement on current return level estimates, with previous methods
typically underestimating. We illustrate our method at four UK tide gauges.

spike caused by the discontinuity of the chemical gradient left behind during
the first dredge-up. The buoyancy spike emerges at the base of the convective
zone in low-luminosity red giants and later becomes a glitch when the g-mode
cavity expands to encompass the spike. Here, we study the impact of the
buoyancy spike on the dipolar mixed modes using stellar models with different
properties. We find that the applicability of the asymptotic formalisms for the
coupling factor, q, varies depending on the location of the evanescent zone,
relative to the position of the spike. Significant deviations between the value
of q inferred from fitting the oscillation frequencies and either of the
formalisms proposed in the literature are found in models with a large
frequency separation in the interval 5 to 15 microHz, with evanescent zones
located in a transition region which may be thin or thick. However, it is still
possible to reconcile q with the predictions from the asymptotic formalisms, by
choosing which formalism to use according to the value of q. For stars
approaching the luminosity bump, the buoyancy spike becomes a glitch and
strongly affects the mode frequencies. Fitting the frequencies without
accounting for the glitch leads to unphysical variations in the inferred q, but
we show that this is corrected when properly accounting for the glitch in the

the high path loss at mmWave frequencies, user equipments (UEs) must form beams

build a large set of encoded samples. As we find it less effective to use past
positive samples which may be highly inconsistent to the encoded feature
property formed with the current positive samples, MoReID is designed to use

leverage the enlarged set of negative samples acquired by the MoReID framework.
To maximize the advantage of using the scaled-up negative sample set, we newly
introduce Hard-distance Elastic loss (HE loss), which is capable of using more
than one hard sample to represent a large number of samples. Our experiments
demonstrate that a large number of negative samples provided by MoReID

reorientation transition at around $T_{SR}$ $\sim$ 115 K where the easy axis of
magnetization changes its direction from in-plane to out-of-plane. The
temperature evolution of magnetization in the FM state is highly anomalous and
extremely sensitive to the direction and strength of applied magnetic field.
Magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_M$) has been estimated in the vicinity of
$T_C$ and $T_{SR}$. $\Delta S_M$($T$) is found to be almost isotropic around
$T_C$ while it shows very unusual behavior and is sensitive to the direction of
applied field at low temperature close to $T_{SR}$. For $B\|c$, $\Delta S_M$ is
negative and decreases continuously with field and -$\Delta S_M$($T$) shows a
broad maximum around $T_{SR}$ similar to that observe at $T_C$. On the other

-$\Delta S_M$($T$) exhibits a peak at $T_{SR}$ which becomes very sharp at high

Its advantage is that the joint maximization gives ML estimators (MLEs) of both

Henderson's joint likelihood does not in linear mixed models. In this paper, we

allows MLEs in the presence of unobserved latent variables. To obtain MLEs for

we show one-shot ML imputation for missing data by treating them as realized

smaller axis ratio (more elongated) than the local RLAGNs with similar stellar
masses and radio luminosities. This evolution can be interpreted as a byproduct
of radio luminosity evolution, namely that galaxies at fixed stellar mass are
more radio luminous at high redshifts: artificially increasing the radio
luminosities of local galaxies ($z\leq$0.3) by a factor of 2 to 4 can remove
the observed evolution of the axis ratio distribution. If this interpretation

two effects lead to a degeneracy which must be properly accounted for if one is
to place reliable constraints on new forces on large scales or, equivalently,
modifications to General Relativity. In this paper we show that current
constraints are such that assumptions about the background expansion have
little impact on constraints on modifications to gravity. We do so by
considering the background of a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM)

and finally, a general, model-independent, expansion rate. We use Gaussian
Processes to model modifications to Poisson's equation and, in the case of a
general expansion rate, to model the redshift dependent Hubble rate. We
identify a degeneracy between modifications to Poisson's equation and the
background matter density, $\Omega_M$, which can only be broken by assuming a
model-dependent expansion rate. We show that, with current data, the

In the following, we will address the question of systematic errors for Photos
Monte Carlo for simulation of bremsstrahlung corrections in final states, which
can not, in principle, be identified as a decay of resonances. It is possible,
because the program features explicit and exact parametrization of phase space
for multi-body plus multi-photon final states. The Photos emission kernel for
some processes consist of complete matrix element, in the remaining cases
appropriate approximation is used. Comparisons with results of simulations,
from generators based on exact phase space and exact fixed order matrix
elements, can be used. For the purpose of such validations Photos provides an
option to restrict emissions to single photon only. In the current work we
concentrate on final state bremsstrahlung in $q \bar{q}(e^+e^-) \to l^+l^-
l^+l^- \gamma$ and $\gamma\gamma \to l^+l^- \gamma$ processes. The reference
distributions used as a cross-check are obtained from the fixed-order MadGraph
Monte Carlo simulations. For the purpose of validation we concentrate on those
phase space regions where Photos is not expected to work on the basis of its
design alone. These phase space regions of hard, non-collinear photons, do not
contribute to large logarithmic terms. We find that in these phase space
regions the differences between Photos and MadGraph results do not surpass a
few percent and these regions, in turn, contribute about 10% to the observed
process rates. This is encouraging in view of the possible ambiguities for
precise calculation of realistic observables.

recognition (SLAMER) method. Mobile robots usually have an environment map and
environment information can be assigned to the map. Important information for
mobile robots such as no entry zone can be predicted if localization has
succeeded since relative pose of them can be known. However, this prediction is
failed when localization does not work. Uncertainty of pose estimate must be
considered for robustly using the map information. In addition, robots have
external sensors and environment information can be recognized using the
sensors. This on-line recognition of course contains uncertainty; however, it
has to be fused with the map information for robust environment recognition
since the map also contains uncertainty owing to over time. SLAMER can
simultaneously cope with these uncertainties and achieves accurate localization
and environment recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate LiDAR-based
implementation of SLAMER in two cases. In the first case, we use the
SemanticKITTI dataset and show that SLAMER achieves accurate estimate more than
traditional methods. In the second case, we use an indoor mobile robot and show
that unmeasurable environmental objects such as open doors and no entry lines

density of the magnetic field is found than in the stellar spiral arms. The
global temperature of the hot gas is roughly constant throughout the disk. The
comparison of the findings with those obtained for the starburst galaxy M83

  Aim. Our aim is to understand the spatial distribution of coronal jets within
active regions to understand if there is a preferential location for them to
occur.
  Methods. We analysed five active regions using Solar Dynamics Observatory
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly data over a period of 2-3.5 days when the active
regions were close to disk centre. Each active region had a different age,
magnetic field strength, and topology. We developed a methodology for
determining the position and length of the jets.
  Results. Jets are observed more frequently at the edges of the active regions
and are more densely located around a strong leading sunspot. The number of
coronal jets for our active regions is dependent on the age of the active
region. The older active regions produce more jets than younger ones. Jets were
observed dominantly at the edges of the active regions, and not as frequently
in the centre. The number of jets is independent of the average unsigned
magnetic field and total flux density in the whole active region. The jets are
located around the edges of the strong leading sunspot.

fitted into the general framework of marked point processes. In this work, we
focus on adjusting for mark-point dependence when estimating the mean and
covariance functions of the mark process, given independent replicates of the
marked point process. We assume that the mark process is a Gaussian process and
the point process is a log-Gaussian Cox process, where the mark-point
dependence is generated through the dependence between two latent Gaussian
processes. Under this framework, naive local linear estimators ignoring the
mark-point dependence can be severely biased. We show that this bias can be
corrected using a local linear estimator of the cross-covariance function and
establish uniform convergence rates of the bias-corrected estimators.
Furthermore, we propose a test statistic based on local linear estimators for
mark-point independence, which is shown to converge to an asymptotic normal
distribution in a parametric $\sqrt{n}$-convergence rate. Model diagnostics
tools are developed for key model assumptions and a robust functional
permutation test is proposed for a more general class of mark-point processes.

the resulting images are often noisy. To check the correct placement of these
devices, typically multiple motion-compensated frames are averaged to enhance
the view. Therefore, device tracking is a necessary procedure for this purpose.
Even though angioplasty devices are designed to have radiopaque markers for the
ease of tracking, current methods struggle to deliver satisfactory results due
to the small marker size and complex scenes in angioplasty. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for single stent tracking, which
consists of three hierarchical modules: U-Net based landmark detection, ResNet

RGBD image to perform semantic segmentation and bird's eye view (BEV) semantic
mapping along with providing their encoded features. Meanwhile, the controller
module processes these features with the measurement of GNSS locations and
angular speed to estimate waypoints that come with latent features. Then, two
different agents are used to translate waypoints and latent features into a set
of navigational controls to drive the vehicle. The model is evaluated by
predicting driving records and performing automated driving under various

first ultra-high-definition demoireing dataset (UHDM), which contains 5,000
real-world 4K resolution image pairs, and conduct a benchmark study on current
state-of-the-art methods. Further, we present an efficient baseline model
ESDNet for tackling 4K moire images, wherein we build a semantic-aligned
scale-aware module to address the scale variation of moire patterns. Extensive

we propose a new probabilistic framework for DG where the goal is to learn

distribution shifts seen during training should inform us of probable shifts at
test time, which we realize by explicitly relating training and test domains as
draws from the same underlying meta-distribution. To achieve probable DG, we
propose a new optimization problem called Quantile Risk Minimization (QRM). By
minimizing the $\alpha$-quantile of predictor's risk distribution over domains,
QRM seeks predictors that perform well with probability $\alpha$. To solve QRM

generalization bound for EQRM; and (ii) the conditions under which EQRM

non-negative data, it cannot be said that if the mapping is non-negative, it

GP-Graph first learns to assign each pedestrian into the most likely behavior
group. Using this assignment information, GP-Graph then forms both intra- and
inter-group interactions as graphs, accounting for human-human relations within
a group and group-group relations, respectively. To be specific, for the
intra-group interaction, we mask pedestrian graph edges out of an associated
group. We also propose group pooling&unpooling operations to represent a group

probability map for socially-acceptable future trajectories from the integrated
features of both group interactions. Moreover, we introduce a group-level
latent vector sampling to ensure collective inferences over a set of possible

controllable actuators for use in micro-scale devices, since they expand and
contract significantly (absorbing or expelling fluid) in response to relatively
small temperature changes. Understanding such systems can be difficult because
of the spatially- and temporally-varying properties of the gel, and the complex
relationships between the fluid dynamics, elastic deformation of the gel and
chemical interaction between the polymer and fluid. We address this using a
poro-elastic model, considering the dynamics of a thermo-responsive spherical
hydrogel after a sudden change in the temperature that should result in
substantial swelling or shrinking. We focus on two model examples, with
equilibrium parameters extracted from data in the literature. We find a range
of qualitatively different behaviours when swelling and shrinking, including
cases where swelling and shrinking happen smoothly from the edge, and other
situations which result in the formation of an inwards-travelling spherical
front that separates a core and shell with markedly different degrees of
swelling. We then characterise when each of these scenarios is expected to
occur. An approximate analytical form for the front dynamics is developed, with
two levels of constant porosity, that well-approximates the numerical
solutions. This system can be evolved forward in time, and is simpler to solve
than the full numerics, allowing for more efficient predictions to be made,
such as when deciding dosing strategies for drug-laden hydrogels.

hard hardware bottlenecks are often encountered. Emerging specialty hardware
platforms provide an exciting solution to this problem. In this paper, we
systematically profile and select low-level operations pertinent to GNNs for
scientific computing implemented in the Pytorch Geometric software framework.
These are then rigorously benchmarked on NVIDIA A100 GPUs for several various
combinations of input values, including tensor sparsity. We then analyze these
results for each operation. At a high level, we conclude that on NVIDIA
systems: (1) confounding bottlenecks such as memory inefficiency often dominate
runtime costs moreso than data sparsity alone, (2) native Pytorch operations
are often as or more competitive than their Pytorch Geometric equivalents,
especially at low to moderate levels of input data sparsity, and (3) many
operations central to state-of-the-art GNN architectures have little to no
optimization for sparsity. We hope that these results serve as a baseline for
those developing these operations on specialized hardware and that our
subsequent analysis helps to facilitate future software and hardware based
optimizations of these operations and thus scalable GNN performance as a whole.

example a certain clinic, we could judge whether the model could safely be
deployed or if its performance degrades unacceptably on the specific data.
Existing approaches estimate this based on the confidence of predictions made
on unlabeled test data from the deployment's domain. We find existing methods
struggle with data that present class imbalance, because the methods used to
calibrate confidence do not account for bias induced by class imbalance,
consequently failing to estimate class-wise accuracy. Here, we introduce
class-wise calibration within the framework of performance estimation for
imbalanced datasets. Specifically, we derive class-specific modifications of
state-of-the-art confidence-based model evaluation methods including
temperature scaling (TS), difference of confidences (DoC), and average
thresholded confidence (ATC). We also extend the methods to estimate Dice

lives, analyzing their fairness properties becomes a subject of central
importance. Yet, our best tools for measuring the fairness of learning systems
are rigid fairness metrics encapsulated as mathematical one-liners, offer
limited power to the stakeholders involved in the prediction task, and are easy
to manipulate when we exhort excessive pressure to optimize them. To advance
these issues, we propose to shift focus from shaping fairness metrics to
curating the distributions of examples under which these are computed. In
particular, we posit that every claim about fairness should be immediately
followed by the tagline ""Fair under what examples, and collected by whom?"". By
highlighting connections to the literature in domain generalization, we propose
to measure fairness as the ability of the system to generalize under multiple
stress tests -- distributions of examples with social relevance. We encourage
each stakeholder to curate one or multiple stress tests containing examples
reflecting their (possibly conflicting) interests. The machine passes or fails
each stress test by falling short of or exceeding a pre-defined metric value.
The test results involve all stakeholders in a discussion about how to improve
the learning system, and provide flexible assessments of fairness dependent on
context and based on interpretable data. We provide full implementation
guidelines for stress testing, illustrate both the benefits and shortcomings of
this framework, and introduce a cryptographic scheme to enable a degree of

the proof of PPAD hardness (in which we apply a population game reduction from
unrestricted polymatrix games) and the proof of containment in PPAD (by
derandomizing the selection of a pure equilibrium from a mixed one). In fact,
our approach implies containment in PPAD for any class of Lipschitz games where

important philosophical questions. Interestingly, a particular theoretical
development of quantum mechanics, called the process matrix formalism (PMF),
features another kind of nonseparability, called causal nonseparability. The
PMF appeals to the notion of quantum process, which is a generalisation of the
concept of quantum state allowing to represent quantum-like correlations
between quantum events over multiple parties without specifying a priori their
spatiotemporal locations. Crucially, since the PMF makes no assumption about
the global causal structure between quantum events, it allows for the existence
of causally nonseparable quantum processes having an indefinite causal
structure. This work aims at investigating the philosophical implications of
causal nonseparability, especially for the notion of spatiotemporal relations.
A preliminary discussion will study the formal connection between quantum and
causal nonseparability. It will be emphasised that, although quantum processes
can be seen as a generalisation of density matrices, the conceptual distinction
between the two notions yields significant differences between quantum and
causal nonseparability. From there, it will be shown that, depending on the
interpretative framework, causal nonseparability suggests some kind of
indeterminacy of spatiotemporal relations. Namely, within a realist context,
spatiotemporal relations can be epistemically or metaphysically indeterminate.
Finally, it will be argued that, in spite of the disanalogies between standard
and causal nonseparability, similar implications for spatial relations can
already be defended in the context of standard quantum mechanics. This work
highlights the potentially very fruitful explorations of the implications of
quantum features on the conception of spacetime.

core-collapse explosion of a massive star with an initial mass of ~15 Msun and
a pre-explosion radius of 631 Rsun. To explain the early-time behaviour of the

pre-existing CSM, which is most likely a common property of highly convective
red supergiant envelopes. We argue that the difficulty in fitting the entire

non-perturbative renormalization of gauge invariant nonlocal operators. In this
prescription, the non-perturbative vertex function is improved by subtracting
unwanted finite lattice spacing ($a$) effects, calculated in lattice
perturbation theory. The method is versatile and can be applied to a wide range
of fermion and gluon actions, as well as types of nonlocal operators. The
presence of operator mixing can also be accommodated.
  Compared to the standard RI' prescription, this variant can be recast as a
supplementary finite renormalization, whose coefficients bring about
corrections of higher order in $a$; consequently, it coincides with standard
RI' as $a\to 0$, however it can afford us a smoother and more controlled
extrapolation to the continuum limit.
  In this proof-of-concept calculation we focus on nonlocal fermion bilinear
operators containing a straight Wilson line. In the numerical implementation we
use Wilson/clover fermions and Iwasaki improved gluons. The finite-$a$ terms
were calculated to one-loop level in lattice perturbation theory, and to all
orders in $a$, using the same action as the non-perturbative vertex functions.
We find that the method leads to significant improvement in the perturbative
region indicated by small and intermediate values of the length of the Wilson
line. This results in a robust extraction of the renormalization functions in
that region.
  We have also applied the above method to operators with stout-smeared links.
We show how to perform the perturbative correction for any number of smearing
iterations, and evaluate its effect on the power divergent renormalization
coefficients.

there are few studies in this area for sound generation. In this study, we
investigate generating sound conditioned on a text prompt and propose a novel
text-to-sound generation framework that consists of a text encoder, a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), a decoder, and a vocoder. The
framework first uses the decoder to transfer the text features extracted from
the text encoder to a mel-spectrogram with the help of VQ-VAE, and then the
vocoder is used to transform the generated mel-spectrogram into a waveform. We
found that the decoder significantly influences the generation performance.
Thus, we focus on designing a good decoder in this study. We begin with the
traditional autoregressive decoder, which has been proved as a state-of-the-art
method in previous sound generation works. However, the AR decoder always
predicts the mel-spectrogram tokens one by one in order, which introduces the
unidirectional bias and accumulation of errors problems. Moreover, with the AR
decoder, the sound generation time increases linearly with the sound duration.
To overcome the shortcomings introduced by AR decoders, we propose a
non-autoregressive decoder based on the discrete diffusion model, named
Diffsound. Specifically, the Diffsound predicts all of the mel-spectrogram
tokens in one step and then refines the predicted tokens in the next step, so
the best-predicted results can be obtained after several steps. Our experiments
show that our proposed Diffsound not only produces better text-to-sound
generation results when compared with the AR decoder but also has a faster
generation speed, e.g., MOS: 3.56 \textit{v.s} 2.786, and the generation speed
is five times faster than the AR decoder.

by detecting their thermal emission and proper motion between two far-infrared
all-sky surveys separated by 23.4 years, taken with the InfraRed Astronomical
Satellite (IRAS) and the AKARI Space Telescope. An upper distance limit of
about 8,000 AU is given by both the sensitivities of these surveys and the
distance at which proper motion becomes too small to be detected. This paper
covers the region from 8,000 AU to 700 AU. We have used a series of filtering
and SED-fitting algorithms to find candidate pairs, whose IRAS and AKARI flux
measurements could together plausibly be fitted by a Planck thermal
distribution for a likely planetary temperature. Theoretical studies have
placed various constraints on the likely existence of unknown planets in the
outer solar system. The main observational constraint to date comes from a WISE
study: an upper limit on an unknown planet's mass out into the Oort cloud. Our
work confirms this result for our distance range, and provides additional
observational constraints for lower distances and planetary masses, subject to
the proviso that the planet is not confused with Galactic cirrus. We found 535
potential candidates with reasonable spectral energy distribution (SED) fits.
Most would have masses close to or below that of Neptune (~0.05 Jupiter mass),
and be located below 1,000 AU. However, examination of the infrared images of
these candidates suggests that none is sufficiently compelling to warrant
follow-up, since all are located inside or close to cirrus clouds, which are
most likely the source of the far-infrared flux.

independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The
tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a
tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight
independent set, can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$ if the input graph is given
with a tree decomposition of independence number at most $k$. However, it was
an open problem if tree-independence number could be computed or approximated
in $n^{f(k)}$ time, for some function $f$, and in particular it was not known
if maximum weight independent set could be solved in polynomial time on graphs
of bounded tree-independence number.
  In this paper, we resolve the main open problems about the computation of
tree-independence number. First, we give an algorithm that given an $n$-vertex
graph $G$ and an integer $k$, in time $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ either outputs a
tree decomposition of $G$ with independence number at most $8k$, or determines
that the tree-independence number of $G$ is larger than $k$. This implies
$2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight
independent set, parameterized by tree-independence number $k$ without needing
the decomposition as an input. Then, we show that the exact computing of
tree-independence number is para-NP-hard, in particular, that for every
constant $k \ge 4$ it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has
tree-independence number at most $k$.

quantum systems for which classical approaches are bound to fail. Even though
several existing quantum devices now feature total qubit numbers of more than
one hundred, their applicability remains plagued by the presence of noise and
errors. Thus, the degree to which large quantum systems can successfully be
simulated on these devices remains unclear. Here, we report on cloud
simulations performed on several of IBM's superconducting quantum computers to
simulate ground states of spin chains having a wide range of system sizes up to
one hundred and two qubits. We find that the ground-state energies extracted
from realizations across different quantum computers and system sizes reach the
expected values to within errors that are small (i.e. on the percent level),
including the inference of the energy density in the thermodynamic limit from
these values. We achieve this accuracy through a combination of
physics-motivated variational Ansatzes, and efficient, scalable
energy-measurement and error-mitigation protocols, including the use of a
reference state in the zero-noise extrapolation. By using a 102-qubit system,
we have been able to successfully apply up to 3186 CNOT gates in a single
circuit when performing gate-error mitigation. Our accurate, error-mitigated
results for random parameters in the Ansatz states suggest that a standalone
hybrid quantum-classical variational approach for large-scale XXZ models is
feasible.

the Universe, is one of the cornerstones of modern cosmology and its violation
would invalidate the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric,
causing a major change in our understanding of the Universe. Thus, it is of
fundamental importance to perform observational tests of this principle. We
determine the precision with which future surveys will be able to test the
Copernican principle and their ability to detect any possible violations. We
forecast constraints on the inhomogeneous Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi model with
a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ ($\Lambda$LTB), basically a cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, but endowed with
a spherical inhomogeneity. We consider combinations of currently available data
and simulated Euclid data, together with external data products, based on both
$\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda$LTB fiducial models. These constraints are compared
to the expectations from the Copernican principle. When considering the
$\Lambda$CDM fiducial model, we find that Euclid data, in combination with
other current and forthcoming surveys, will improve the constraints on the
Copernican principle by about $30\%$, with $\pm10\%$ variations depending on
the observables and scales considered. On the other hand, when considering a
$\Lambda$LTB fiducial model, we find that future Euclid data, combined with
other current and forthcoming data sets, will be able to detect Gpc-scale
inhomogeneities of contrast $-0.1$. Next-generation surveys, such as Euclid,
will thoroughly test homogeneity at large scales, tightening the constraints on
possible violations of the Copernican principle.

party cloud: scheduling containers to machines. There are tens of services and
each service runs a set of homogeneous containers with dynamic resource usage;
containers of a service are scheduled daily in a batch fashion. This problem
can be naturally formulated as Stochastic Bin Packing Problem (SBPP). However,
traditional SBPP research often focuses on cases of empty machines, whose
objective, i.e., to minimize the number of used machines, is not well-defined
for the more common reality with nonempty machines. This paper aims to close
this gap. First, we define a new objective metric, Used Capacity at Confidence

proved to be consistent for both empty and nonempty machines, and reformulate
the SBPP under chance constraints. Second, by modeling the container resource

to the proposed improved exponential power rate reaching law, which also
improves the finite convergence time. To implement the proposed algorithm,
nonlinear mathematical model has to be decrypted without linearizing, and used

using boundary method and also second order sliding mode method. PI-type

using deep learning methods can aid in diagnosing and treating cancer. However,
organs often overlap and are complexly connected, characterized by extensive
anatomical variation and low contrast. In addition, the diversity of tumor

voxels, makes accurate 3D medical image segmentation difficult. In this paper,
a novel large-kernel (LK) attention module is proposed to address these

The advantages of convolution and self-attention are combined in the proposed
LK attention module, including local contextual information, long-range
dependence, and channel adaptation. The module also decomposes the LK
convolution to optimize the computational cost and can be easily incorporated
into FCNs such as U-Net. Comprehensive ablation experiments demonstrated the
feasibility of convolutional decomposition and explored the most efficient and
effective network design. Among them, the best Mid-type LK attention-based
U-Net network was evaluated on CT-ORG and BraTS 2020 datasets, achieving

address this challenge is to leverage all available resources across multiple
edge devices to deploy and execute a large CNN by properly partitioning the CNN

AutoDiCE, for automated splitting of a CNN model into a set of sub-models and
automated code generation for distributed and collaborative execution of these

the exploitation of parallelism among and within the edge devices. Our

Here, we provide a convergent power series solution for interface shapes that
rise above the horizontal pool as a function of Bond number. The power series
solution is expressed in terms of a pre-factor that matches the large distance

the study of information-theoretic security for a multiple access wiretap
(MAC-WT) channel, and then prove it for the case with three users by directly
using the Fourier-Motzkin procedure. It is shown that large amounts of
inequalities are generated in the elimination procedure while most of them are
redundant. Actually, the number of generated inequalities grows doubly
exponentially with the number of users or eliminating variables. It thus
becomes unmanageable to directly prove the theorem in this brute-force way.
Besides the great complexity, another disadvantage of the direct strategy is
that it works only if the number of users is given. Obviously, this makes the
strategy inappropriate for the proof of the theorem since it is a general
result for any number of users. It is thus urgent and challenging to generally
prove the theorem.
