Space Telescope (JWST), as determined from the six month commissioning period.
We summarize the performance of the spacecraft, telescope, science instruments,
and ground system, with an emphasis on differences from pre-launch
expectations. Commissioning has made clear that JWST is fully capable of
achieving the discoveries for which it was built. Moreover, almost across the
board, the science performance of JWST is better than expected; in most cases,
JWST will go deeper faster than expected. The telescope and instrument suite
have demonstrated the sensitivity, stability, image quality, and spectral range
that are necessary to transform our understanding of the cosmos through
observations spanning from near-earth asteroids to the most distant galaxies.

adjacent pieces. Instead, we infer a mental image from all pieces, which a
given piece can then be matched against avoiding the combinatorial explosion.
Exploiting advancements in Generative Adversarial methods, we learn how to
reconstruct the image given a set of unordered pieces, allowing the model to
learn a joint embedding space to match an encoding of each piece to the cropped
layer of the generator. Therefore we frame the problem as a R@1 retrieval task,
and then solve the linear assignment using differentiable Hungarian attention,
making the process end-to-end. In doing so our model is puzzle size agnostic,
in contrast to prior deep learning methods which are single size. We evaluate
on two new large-scale datasets, where our model is on par with deep learning
methods, while generalizing to multiple puzzle sizes.

coarse-grained model for biomolecular simulations. Due to the improved
interaction balance it allows for more accurate description of condensed phase
systems. In the present work we develop a consistent strategy to parametrize
carbohydrate molecules accurately within the framework of Martini 3. In
particular, we develop a canonical mapping scheme that decomposes arbitrarily
large carbohydrates into a limited number of fragments. Bead types for these
fragments have been assigned by matching physicochemical properties of mono-
and disaccharides. In addition, guidelines for assigning bonds, angles, and
dihedrals are developed. These guidelines enable a more accurate description of
carbohydrate conformations than in the Martini 2 force field. We show that
models obtained with this approach are able to accurately reproduce osmotic
pressures of carbohydrate water solutions. Furthermore, we provide evidence
that the model differentiates correctly the solubility of the poly-glucoses
dextran (water soluble) and cellulose (water insoluble, but soluble in
ionic-liquids). Finally, we demonstrate that the new building blocks can be
applied to glycolipids, being able to reproduce membrane properties and to
induce binding of peripheral membrane proteins. These test cases demonstrate
the validity and transferability of our approach.

space-time caused by the gravitational perturbation can play an important role

cyclics depend on the degree of deformation of space-time. The role of this
anomaly in neutrino oscillation may be important. There may be a relation
between cyclic anomaly and other anomalies of neutrinos such as mass limits,

cyclic anomalies might be detected experimentally. If these anomalies are

well-known concrete $3$-graphs $F$ (e.g.\ $K_4^-$ and the Fano plane).

scene image, which plays a vital role in a range of safety-critical
applications, such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring and flow control.
In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of deep learning based crowd
counting models to backdoor attacks, a major security threat to deep learning.
A backdoor attack implants a backdoor trigger into a target model via data
poisoning so as to control the model's predictions at test time. Different from
image classification models on which most of existing backdoor attacks have
been developed and tested, crowd counting models are regression models that
output multi-dimensional density maps, thus requiring different techniques to
manipulate.
  In this paper, we propose two novel Density Manipulation Backdoor Attacks
(DMBA$^{-}$ and DMBA$^{+}$) to attack the model to produce arbitrarily large or
small density estimations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our DMBA attacks on five classic crowd counting models and four types of
datasets. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the unique challenges of
backdooring crowd counting models and reveal two key elements of effective
attacks: 1) full and dense triggers and 2) manipulation of the ground truth
counts or density maps. Our work could help evaluate the vulnerability of crowd
counting models to potential backdoor attacks.

combination of a point charge and a small gas, i.e.\ measures of the form

$(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{V}):\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^6$ and a small gas
distribution $\mu:\mathbb{R}\to L^2_{{\bf x},{\bf v}}$, and study asymptotic
dynamics in the associated initial value problem. If initially suitable moments
on $\mu_0=\mu(t=0)$ are small, we obtain a global solution of the above form,
and the electric field generated by the gas distribution $\mu$ decays at an
almost optimal rate. Assuming in addition boundedness of suitable derivatives
of $\mu_0$, the electric field decays at an optimal rate and we derive a
modified scattering dynamics for the motion of the point charge and the gas
distribution.
  Our proof makes crucial use of the Hamiltonian structure. The linearized
system is transport by the Kepler ODE, which we integrate exactly through an
asymptotic action-angle transformation. Thanks to a precise understanding of
the associated kinematics, moment and derivative control is achieved via a
bootstrap analysis that relies on the decay of the electric field associated to
$\mu$. The asymptotic behavior can then be deduced from the properties of
Poisson brackets in asymptotic action coordinates.

derive speed limits on correlations such as entanglement, Bell-CHSH
correlation, and quantum mutual information of quantum systems evolving under
dynamical processes. Our main result is speed limit on an entanglement monotone
called negativity which holds for arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum
systems and processes. Another entanglement monotone which we consider is the
concurrence. To illustrate efficacy of our speed limits, we analytically and
numerically compute the speed limits on the negativity, concurrence, and
Bell-CHSH correlation for various quantum processes of practical interest. We
are able to show that for practical examples we have considered, some of the
speed limits we derived are actually attainable and hence these bounds can be
considered to be tight.

that polymer additives can homogenize this flow by inducing a purely-elastic
flow instability that generates random spatiotemporal fluctuations and excess
flow resistance in individual strata. In particular, we find that this
instability arises at smaller imposed flow rates in higher-permeability strata,
diverting flow towards lower-permeability strata and helping to homogenize the

machine learning problems, such as multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification
and constrained Markov decision processes. However, such kinds of problems are
challenging because both the objective and constraints are possibly nonconvex,
so it is difficult to balance the reduction of the loss value and reduction of
constraint violation. Although there are a few methods that solve this class of
problems, all of them are double-loop or triple-loop algorithms, and they
require oracles to solve some subproblems up to certain accuracy by tuning
multiple hyperparameters at each iteration. In this paper, we propose a novel
gradient descent and perturbed ascent (GDPA) algorithm to solve a class of
smooth nonconvex inequality constrained problems. The GDPA is a primal-dual
algorithm, which only exploits the first-order information of both the
objective and constraint functions to update the primal and dual variables in
an alternating way. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is a
single-loop algorithm, where only two step-sizes need to be tuned. We show that
under a mild regularity condition GDPA is able to find Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
points of nonconvex functional constrained problems with convergence rate
guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first single-loop algorithm
that can solve the general nonconvex smooth problems with nonconvex inequality
constraints. Numerical results also showcase the superiority of GDPA compared
with the best-known algorithms (in terms of both stationarity measure and
feasibility of the obtained solutions).

different response each time they are run, even when the input parameters are
held at fixed values. They arise when additional sources of uncertainty are
affecting the computer model, which are not explicitly modeled as input
parameters. The uncertainty analysis of stochastic simulators requires their
repeated evaluation for different values of the input variables, as well as for
different realizations of the underlying latent stochasticity. The
computational cost of such analyses can be considerable, which motivates the
construction of surrogate models that can approximate the original model and
its stochastic response, but can be evaluated at much lower cost.
  We propose a surrogate model for stochastic simulators based on spectral
expansions. Considering a certain class of stochastic simulators that can be
repeatedly evaluated for the same underlying random event, we view the
simulator as a random field indexed by the input parameter space. For a fixed
realization of the latent stochasticity, the response of the simulator is a
deterministic function, called trajectory. Based on samples from several such
trajectories, we approximate the latter by sparse polynomial chaos expansion
and compute analytically an extended Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) to reduce
its dimensionality. The uncorrelated but dependent random variables of the KLE
are modeled by advanced statistical techniques such as parametric inference,
vine copula modeling, and kernel density estimation. The resulting surrogate
model approximates the marginals and the covariance function, and allows to
obtain new realizations at low computational cost. We observe that in our
numerical examples, the first mode of the KLE is by far the most important, and
investigate this phenomenon and its implications.

we disprove this common belief. The first point to clarify is that the
fundamental constraint is not from spin-orbital coupling but the symmetry
algebra of time reversal and mirror operations. Then, our theory is based on
the conceptual transformation that the symmetry algebras will be projectively
modified under gauge fields. Particularly, we show that the symmetry algebra of
mirror reflection and time-reversal required for MCI can be achieved
projectively in spinless systems with lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields,
i.e., by allowing real hopping amplitudes to take $\pm$ signs. Moreover, we
propose the basic structure, the twisted $\pi$-flux blocks, to fulfill the
projective symmetry algebra, and develop a general approach to construct
spinless MCIs based on these building blocks. Two concrete spinless MCI models

the same complexity of the interstellar medium (ISM) as expected from resolved

high-z spectra are often unresolved, and inferring reliable diagnostics
represents a major obstacle. Bright, nearby, unresolved galaxies provide many
constraints to design methods to infer ISM properties, but they have so far
been limited to deterministic methods and/or with simple topological
assumptions.
  Multicomponent ISM models associate a complex enough distribution of matter
and phases with a simple enough topological description to be constrained with
probabilistic frameworks. Our goal is to provide a flexible statistical
framework that is agnostic to the model grid and that considers either a few
discrete components defined by their parameter values and/or statistical
distributions of parameters.
  In this study we present a the MULTIGRIS framework and use it to model a
suite of spectral lines in the star-forming regions of the metal-poor dwarf
galaxy IZw18. We are able to calculate accurate values for the metallicity,
number of ionizing photons, masses of ionized and neutral hydrogen, as well as
the dust mass and the dust-to-gas mass ratio. We find a relatively modest
amount of H$_2$ which is predominantly CO-dark and traced by C$^+$ rather than
C$^0$. Nevertheless, more than $90$% of the [CII] emission is associated with
the neutral atomic gas. Our models confirm the necessity to consider an X-ray
source. Finally, we investigate the escape fraction of ionizing photons for
different energy ranges. While the escape fraction for the main HII region lies
around $50-65$%, we show that most of the soft X-ray photons are able to escape

the existing works adopt distillation-based methods, which focus on pushing new
features to imitate the distribution of the old ones. However, the
distillation-based methods are intrinsically sub-optimal since it forces the
new feature space to imitate the inferior old feature space. To address this
issue, we propose the Ranking-based Backward Compatible Learning (RBCL), which
directly optimizes the ranking metric between new features and old features.
Different from previous methods, RBCL only pushes the new features to find
best-ranking positions in the old feature space instead of strictly alignment,
and is in line with the ultimate goal of backward retrieval. However, the sharp
sigmoid function used to make the ranking metric differentiable also incurs the
gradient vanish issue, therefore stems the ranking refinement during the later
period of training. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Gradient
Reactivation (DGR), which can reactivate the suppressed gradients by adding
dynamic computed constant during forward step. To further help targeting the
best-ranking positions, we include the Neighbor Context Agents (NCAs) to
approximate the entire old feature space during training. Unlike previous works
which only test on the in-domain settings, we make the first attempt to
introduce the cross-domain settings (including both supervised and
unsupervised), which are more meaningful and difficult. The experimental
results on all five settings show that the proposed RBCL outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods by large margins under all settings.

dependency on $n$ is nearly linear, the space-query product of their oracles
depend quadratically on $1/\epsilon$. Many follow-up results either improved
the space \emph{or} the query time of the oracles while having the same,
sometimes worst, dependency on $1/\epsilon$. Kawarabayashi, Sommer, and Thorup
[SODA'13] were the first to improve the dependency on $1/\epsilon$ from
quadratic to nearly linear (at the cost of $\log^*(n)$ factors). It is
plausible to conjecture that the linear dependency on $1/\epsilon$ is optimal:
for many known distance-related problems in planar graphs, it was proved that
the dependency on $1/\epsilon$ is at least linear.
  In this work, we disprove this conjecture by reducing the dependency of the
space-query product on $1/\epsilon$ from linear all the way down to
\emph{subpolynomial} $(1/\epsilon)^{o(1)}$. More precisely, we construct an

  minimization problems with an application to radiotherapy treatment planning","Revised version, October 10, 2022; accepted for publication in:
  Applied Mathematics and Computation",,,,"math.OC physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the split minimization problem that consists of two
constrained minimization problems in two separate spaces that are connected via
a linear operator that maps one space into the other. To handle the data of
such a problem we develop a superiorization approach that can reach a feasible
point with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function values. The
superiorization methodology is based on interlacing the iterative steps of two
separate and independent iterative processes by perturbing the iterates of one
process according to the steps dictated by the other process. We include in our
developed method two novel elements. The first one is the permission to restart
the perturbations in the superiorized algorithm which results in a significant
acceleration and increases the computational efficiency. The second element is
the ability to independently superiorize subvectors. This caters to the needs
of real-world applications, as demonstrated here for a problem in
intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.

methodology that aims at computing a logical justification for dividing a group
of data in two groups of observations, usually called the positive and negative
groups. Consider this partition into positive and negative groups as the
description of a partially defined Boolean function; the data is then processed
to identify a subset of attributes, whose values may be used to characterize
the observations of the positive groups against those of the negative group.
  LAD constitutes an interesting rule-based learning alternative to classic
statistical learning techniques and has many practical applications.
Nevertheless, the computation of group characterization may be costly,
depending on the properties of the data instances. A major aim of our work is
to provide effective tools for speeding up the computations, by computing some
\emph{a priori} probability that a given set of attributes does characterize
the positive and negative groups. To this effect, we propose several models for
representing the data set of observations, according to the information we have
on it. These models, and the probabilities they allow us to compute, are also
helpful for quickly assessing some properties of the real data at hand;
furthermore they may help us to better analyze and understand the computational
difficulties encountered by solving methods.
  Once our models have been established, the mathematical tools for computing
probabilities come from Analytic Combinatorics. They allow us to express the
desired probabilities as ratios of generating functions coefficients, which
then provide a quick computation of their numerical values. A further,
long-range goal of this paper is to show that the methods of Analytic
Combinatorics can help in analyzing the performance of various algorithms in
LAD and related fields.

13, 2014, using data from SDO/AIA, RHESSI, Hinode/XRT, and IRIS. Unlike most
coronal jets where hard X-ray (HXR) emissions are usually observed near the jet
base, in these events HXR emissions are found at several locations, including
in the corona. We carry out the first differential emission measure (DEM)
analysis that combines both AIA (and XRT when available) bandpass filter data
and RHESSI HXR measurements for coronal jets, and obtain self-consistent
results across a wide temperature range and into non-thermal energies. In both
events, hot plasma first appeared at the jet base, but as the base plasma
gradually cooled, hot plasma also appeared near the jet top. Moreover,
non-thermal electrons, while only mildly energetic, are found in multiple HXR
locations and contain a large amount of total energy. Particularly, the
energetic electrons that produced the HXR sources at the jet top were
accelerated near the top location, rather than traveling from a reconnection
site at the jet base. This means that there was more than one particle
acceleration site in each event. Jet velocities are consistent with previous
studies, including upward and downward velocities around ~200 km/s and ~100
km/s respectively, and fast outflows of 400-700 km/s. We also examine the
energy partition in the later event, and find that the non-thermal energy in
accelerated electrons is most significant compared to other energy forms
considered. We discuss the interpretations and provide constraints on

impact of minibatch sampling on the model performance. As a consequence, during
parameter update, gradients are computed on the whole dataset, undermining
scalability to large graphs. To account for this, we research alternative
methods which allow to safely learn good parameters while sampling only a
subset of data per iteration. We reproduce the results reported in the work of
Kipf et al. and propose an implementation inspired to SIGN, which is a
sampling-free minibatch method. Eventually we compare the two implementations
on a benchmark dataset, proving that they are comparable in terms of prediction
accuracy for the task of semi-supervised node classification.

treatment method, especially for severe and chronic diseases. However, using
multiple drugs together may cause interactions between drugs. Drug-drug
interaction (DDI) is the activity that occurs when the impact of one drug
changes when combined with another. DDIs may obstruct, increase, or decrease
the intended effect of either drug or, in the worst-case scenario, create
adverse side effects. While it is critical to detect DDIs on time, it is
timeconsuming and expensive to identify them in clinical trials due to their
short duration and many possible drug pairs to be considered for testing. As a
result, computational methods are needed for predicting DDIs. In this paper, we
present a novel heterogeneous graph attention model, HAN-DDI to predict
drug-drug interactions. We create a heterogeneous network of drugs with
different biological entities. Then, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention
network to learn DDIs using relations of drugs with other entities. It consists
of an attention-based heterogeneous graph node encoder for obtaining drug node
representations and a decoder for predicting drug-drug interactions. Further,
we utilize comprehensive experiments to evaluate of our model and to compare it

  We also allow declaring assumptions on the execution which permits to obtain
more precise verdicts also under imprecise inputs.
  To this end, we show how to understand a given correctness property as a

iteratively, whenever more and more observations of the run are given.
  We base our framework on stream runtime verification, which allows to express
temporal correctness properties not only in the Boolean but also in richer
logical theories.

formulas, we identify domains (including Booleans and Linear Algebra) for which
pruning strategies exist, which allows to monitor with constant memory (i.e.
independent of the length of the observation) while preserving the same

During the course of the survey 180 nights of observation were completed at
Kitt Peak, Arizona. A total of 262 novae were either discovered or confirmed,
40 of which have not been previously reported. Of these, 203 novae form a
spatially-complete sample detected by the KPNO/WIYN 0.9-m telescope within a
$20'\times20'$ field centered on the nucleus of M31. An additional 50 novae are
part of a spatially-complete sample detected by the KPNO 4-m telescope within a
larger $36'\times36'$ field. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that
the spatial distribution of novae in both surveys follows the bulge light of
M31 somewhat more closely than the overall background light of the galaxy.
After correcting for the limiting magnitude and the spatial and temporal
coverage of the surveys, a final nova rate in M31 is found to be
$R=40^{+5}_{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is considerably lower than recent estimates.
When normalized to the $K$-band luminosity of M31, this value yields a
luminosity-specific nova rate, $\nu_K = 3.3\pm0.4$ yr$^{-1} [10^{10}
L_{\odot,K}]^{-1}$. By scaling the M31 nova rate using the relative infrared

pseudo two-color diagram or 'chromosome map'. The clear separation of its
stellar populations in the color-magnitude diagram and the distribution of the
giant stars in the chromosome map strongly suggests that NGC 362 could host
stars with both cluster-nominal as well as enhanced heavy-element abundances,
and one of them could be iron. However, despite previous spectroscopic
observations of NGC 362, no such iron variation has been detected. Our main
goal is to confirm or disprove this result by searching for any internal
variation of [Fe/H] which would give us insight into the formation and
evolution of this interesting globular cluster. In this paper, we present the
abundance analysis for a sample of 11 red giant branch members based on
high-resolution and high S/N spectra obtained with the MIKE echelle
spectrograph mounted at the Magellan-Clay telescope. HST and GAIA photometry
and astrometry has been used to determine atmospheric parameters and
membership. We obtained T$_{\text{eff}}$, log(g) and v$_{\text{t}}$ for our
target stars and measured the mean iron content of the sample and its
dispersion with three different methods, which lead to
[Fe/H]$_1$=-1.10$\pm0.02$, [Fe/H]$_2$=-1.09$\pm0.01$ and
[Fe/H]$_3$=-1.10$\pm0.01$, while the internal dispersion turned out to be
$\sigma_{[\text{Fe/H}]_1}$=0.06$\pm0.01$,
$\sigma_{[\text{Fe/H}]_2}$=0.03$\pm0.01$ and
$\sigma_{[\text{Fe/H}]_3}$=0.05$\pm0.01$ respectively. The error analysis gives
an internal dispersion due to observational error of 0.05 dex. Comparing the
observed dispersion with the internal errors, we conclude that NGC 362 does not
show any trace of an internal iron spread.

To this end, we proceed in two steps: Firstly, building upon the recent RAFT-3D

advanced stereo method. Secondly, and even more importantly, exploiting the
specific modeling concepts of RAFT-3D, we propose a U-Net architecture that
performs a fusion of forward and backward flow estimates and hence allows to
integrate temporal information on demand. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark do
not only show that the advantages of the improved baseline and the temporal
fusion approach complement each other, they also demonstrate that the computed
scene flow is highly accurate. More precisely, our approach ranks second
overall and first for the even more challenging foreground objects, in total
outperforming the original RAFT-3D method by more than 16%. Code is available

bottleneck of an EBS, which is the integration of a system of differential
equations for linear cosmological perturbations, by neural networks. This
strategy offers advantages compared to the direct emulation of the final
observables, including small networks that are easy to train in
high-dimensional parameter spaces, and which do not depend by on primordial
spectrum parameters nor observation-related quantities such as selection
functions. In this second CosmicNet paper, we present a more efficient set of
networks that are already trained for extended cosmologies beyond LCDM, with
massive neutrinos, extra relativistic degrees of freedom, spatial curvature,

CLASSNET, which automatically uses networks within a region of trusted
accuracy. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of CLASSNET by presenting
parameter inference runs from Planck, BAO and supernovae data, performed with
CLASSNET and the COBAYA inference package. We have eliminated the perturbation
module as a bottleneck of the EBS, with a speedup that is even more remarkable
in extended cosmologies, where the usual approach would have been more
expensive while the network's performance remains the same. We obtain a speedup
factor of order 150 for the emulated perturbation module of CLASS. For the
whole code, this translates into an overall speedup factor of order 3 when
computing CMB harmonic spectra (now dominated by the highly parallelizable and
further optimizable line-of-sight integration), and of order 50 when computing

effects of two learning approaches, useAllPredictAll and usePrePredictPost, on

When requiring in addition a strict system-bath energy conservation, the GQDB
reduces to the usual notion of detailed balance which ensures QMEs with
Gibbsian steady states. However, if energy conservation is only required on
average, QMEs with non Gibbsian steady states can still maintain a certain
level of thermodynamic consistency. Applying our theory to commonly used QMEs,
we show that the Redfield equation breaks the GQDB, and that some recently
derived approximation schemes based on the Redfield equation (which hold beyond
the secular approximation and allow to derive a QME of Lindblad form) satisfy
the GQDB and the average first law. We find that performing the secular

AGBoost (the attention-based gradient boosting) is proposed for solving

assign attention weights with trainable parameters to iterations of GBM under
condition that decision trees are base learners in GBM. Attention weights are
determined by applying properties of decision trees and by using the Huber's
contamination model which provides an interesting linear dependence between
trainable parameters of the attention and the attention weights. This
peculiarity allows us to train the attention weights by solving the standard
quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. The attention weights
also depend on the discount factor as a tuning parameter, which determines how
much the impact of the weight is decreased with the number of iterations.
Numerical experiments performed for two types of base learners, original
decision trees and extremely randomized trees with various regression datasets
illustrate the proposed model.

test star by Chandrasekhar to the case of relativistic velocities and velocity
distributions also accounting for post-Newtonian corrections to the
gravitational force. The original kinetic framework is revised and used to
construct a special-relativistic dynamical friction formula where the relative
velocities changes in subsequent encounters are added up with Lorentz
transformation and the velocity distribution of the field stars accounts for
relativistic velocities. Furthermore, a simple expression is obtained for
systems where the post-Newtonian correction on the gravitational forces become
relevant even at non-relativistic particle velocities. Finally, using a
linearized Lagrangian we derive another expression for the dynamical friction
expression in a more compact form than that of Lee (1969). Comparing our
formulation with the classical one, we observe that a given test particle
suffers a slightly stronger drag when moving through a distribution of field
stars with relativistic velocity distribution. Vice versa, a purely classical
treatment of a system where post-Newtonian (PN) corrections should be included,
over estimates the effect of dynamical friction at low test particle velocity,
regardless of the form of velocity distribution. Finally, a first order PN
dynamical friction covariant formulation is less strong than its classical
counterpart at small velocities but much higher for large velocities over a
broad range of mass ratios

and sizing requirements that prevent scaled production of such robots. To
address this challenge, we use an actuation mechanism based on electromagnets
embedded into the edges of each cube to interchangeably create identically or
oppositely polarized electromagnet pairs, resulting in repulsive or attractive
forces, respectively. By leveraging attraction for hinge formation, and
repulsion to drive pivoting maneuvers, we can reconfigure the robot by
voxelizing it and actuating its constituent modules - termed Electrovoxels -
via electromagnetically actuated pivoting. To demonstrate this, we develop
fully untethered, three-dimensional self-reconfigurable robots and demonstrate
2D and 3D self-reconfiguration using pivot and traversal maneuvers on an
air-table and in microgravity on a parabolic flight. This paper describes the
hardware design of our robots, its pivoting framework, our reconfiguration

different languages have different amounts of supervision, cross-lingual
transfer benefits languages with little to no training data by transferring
from other languages. From an engineering perspective, multilingual NLP
benefits development and maintenance by serving multiple languages with a
single system. Both cross-lingual transfer and multilingual NLP rely on
cross-lingual representations serving as the foundation. As BERT revolutionized
representation learning and NLP, it also revolutionized cross-lingual
representations and cross-lingual transfer. Multilingual BERT was released as a

  Surprisingly, without any explicit cross-lingual signal, multilingual BERT
learns cross-lingual representations in addition to representations for
individual languages. This thesis first shows such surprising cross-lingual
effectiveness compared against prior art on various tasks. Naturally, it raises
a set of questions, most notably how do these multilingual encoders learn
cross-lingual representations. In exploring these questions, this thesis will
analyze the behavior of multilingual models in a variety of settings on high
and low resource languages. We also look at how to inject different
cross-lingual signals into multilingual encoders, and the optimization behavior
of cross-lingual transfer with these models. Together, they provide a better
understanding of multilingual encoders on cross-lingual transfer. Our findings
will lead us to suggested improvements to multilingual encoders and

the model class, without any explicit polynomial dependence on the size of the

suppresses the gas collapse and photoionization becomes efficient once a
sufficient number of stars form. The cluster mass is larger by a factor of

with mildly relativistic velocities extending to $\beta=v/c>0.6$. We consider
the radio to X-ray synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven
by such fast ejecta into the interstellar medium. Analytic expressions are
given for spherical ejecta with broken power-law mass (or energy)
distributions, $M(>\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_{\rm KN}$
at $\gamma\beta<\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_{\rm ft}$ at
$\gamma\beta>\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). For
parameter values characteristic of merger calculation results -- a ""shallow""
mass distribution, $1<s_{\rm KN}<3$, for the bulk of the ejecta (at
$\gamma\beta\approx 0.2$), and a steep, $s_{\rm ft}>5$, ""fast tail"" mass
distribution -- our model provides an accurate (to 10's of percent) description
of the evolution of the flux, including at the phase of deceleration to
sub-relativistic expansion. This is a significant improvement over earlier
results, based on extrapolations of results valid for $\gamma\beta\gg1$ or
$\ll1$ to $\gamma\beta\approx1$, which overestimate the flux by an order of
magnitude for typical parameter values. It will enable a more reliable
inference of ejecta parameters from future measurements of the non-thermal
emission. For the merger event GW170817, the existence of a ""fast tail"" is
expected to produce detectable radio and X-ray fluxes over a time scale of
$\sim10^4$days.

of pressure traps. One of the major challenges in the early stages of planet
formation is the meter-size barrier, which sets severe constraints on the
growth timescale of planets. Many solutions were suggested to the meter-size
barrier, among them is pressure traps, i.e. regions in the disk in which the
pressure differs from the general gradient in the disk, such that the drifting
of planetesimals is halted. However, the origin of pressure traps is not clear
yet and hence so does their profile. Distorted disks are ubiquitous among
accretion disks in general and protoplanetary disks in particular, and we claim
that they give rise to the formation of pressure traps, which assist in
overcoming on the meter-size barrier . We derive the profile of the formed
pressure trap induced by a general external torque and discuss the implications
on the initial stages of planet formation in several environments including
circumbinary disks and gap edges.

a task of increasing difficulty. The high-resolution and depth of imaging data
now available render simple analytical forms ineffective at capturing lens
structures spanning a large range in spatial scale, mass scale, and morphology.
In this work, we address the problem with a novel multiscale method based on
wavelets. We tested our method on simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
imaging data of strong lenses containing the following different types of mass
substructures making them deviate from smooth models: (1) a localized small
dark matter subhalo, (2) a Gaussian random field (GRF) that mimics a
nonlocalized population of subhalos along the line of sight, and (3)
galaxy-scale multipoles that break elliptical symmetry. We show that wavelets
are able to recover all of these structures accurately. This is made
technically possible by using gradient-informed optimization based on automatic
differentiation over thousands of parameters, which also allow us to sample the
posterior distributions of all model parameters simultaneously. By
construction, our method merges the two main modeling paradigms - analytical
and pixelated - with machine-learning optimization techniques into a single
modular framework. It is also well-suited for the fast modeling of large
samples of lenses. All methods presented here are publicly available in our new
Herculens package.

isotropic and homogeneous on large scales -- underlies a century of progress in
cosmology. It is conventionally formulated through the
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies as the spacetime
metric, and culminates in the successful and highly predictive
$\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Yet, tensions have emerged
within the $\Lambda$CDM model, most notably a statistically significant
discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Since the notion of
cosmic expansion determined by a single parameter is intimately tied to the CP,
implications of the $H_0$ tension may extend beyond $\Lambda$CDM to the CP
itself. This review surveys current observational hints for deviations from the
expectations of the CP, highlighting synergies and disagreements that warrant
further study. Setting aside the debate about individual large structures,
potential deviations from the CP include variations of cosmological parameters
on the sky, discrepancies in the cosmic dipoles, and mysterious alignments in
quasar polarizations and galaxy spins. While it is possible that a host of
observational systematics are impacting results, it is equally plausible that
precision cosmology may have outgrown the FLRW paradigm, an extremely pragmatic
but non-fundamental symmetry assumption.

galaxy clustering, and their cross-correlation. We use simulated data and blind
analyses of real data to validate the robustness of our results. In many cases,
constraining power is limited by the absence of nonlinear predictions that are
reliable at our required precision. The models are: dark energy with a
time-dependent equation of state, non-zero spatial curvature, sterile
neutrinos, modifications of gravitational physics, and a binned $\sigma_8(z)$
model which serves as a probe of structure growth. For the time-varying dark
energy equation of state evaluated at the pivot redshift we find $(w_{\rm p},

three compared to previous analyses, giving 95% limits of $(\Delta N_{\rm

the lensing and Poisson equations controlled by functions $\Sigma(k,z) =

population properties of the galaxy members in 80 groups at $z \leq 0.8$
previously detected by the AMICO code, as well as for a galaxy field sample
retrieved from the whole miniJPAS sample. We identify blue, red, quiescent, and
transition galaxy populations through their rest-frame (extinction corrected)
colour, stellar mass ($M_\star$) and specific star formation rate. We measure
their abundance as a function of $M_\star$ and environment. We find: (i) The
fraction of red and quiescent galaxies in groups increases with $M_\star$ and
it is always higher in groups than in the field. (ii) The quenched fraction
excess (QFE) in groups strongly increases with $M_\star$, (from a few percent
to higher than 60% in the mass range $10^{10} - 3 \times 10 ^{11}$ $M_\odot$.
(iii) The abundance excess of transition galaxies in groups shows a modest
dependence with $M_\star$ (iv) The fading time scale is very short ($<1.5$
Gyr), indicating that the star formation declines very rapidly in groups. (v)
The evolution of the galaxy quenching rate in groups shows a modest but
significant evolution since $z\sim0.8$, compatible with an evolution with
constant $QFE=0.4$, previously measured for satellites in the nearby Universe,
and consistent with a scenario where the low-mass star-forming galaxies in
clusters at $z= 1-1.4$ are environmentally quenched.

high-redshifts. While observations have established that reionization occurred,
observational constraints on the emissivity of ionizing photons at
high-redshift remains elusive. Here, we present a new analysis of the
Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS) and archival observations, a
combined sample of 89 star-forming galaxies at z~0.3 with Hubble Space
Telescope observations of their ionizing continua (or Lyman Continuum, LyC). We
find a strong (6$\sigma$ significant) inverse correlation between the continuum
slope at 1550\r{A} (defined as F$_\lambda\propto\lambda^{\beta}$) and both the
LyC escape fraction (f$_{esc}$) and f$_{esc}$ times the ionizing photon
production efficiency ($\xi_{ ion}$). On average, galaxies with redder
continuum slopes have smaller f$_{esc}$ than galaxies with bluer slopes due to
higher dust attenuation. More than 5% (20%) of the LyC emission escapes
galaxies with $\beta$<-2.1 (-2.6). We find strong correlations between $\beta$
and the gas-phase ionization ([OIII]/[OII] flux ratio; at 7.5$\sigma$
significance), galaxy stellar mass (at 5.9$\sigma$), the gas-phase metallicity
(at 4.6$\sigma$), and the observed FUV absolute magnitude (M$_{UV}$ at
3.4$\sigma$). Using previous observations of $\beta$ at high-redshift, we
estimate the evolution of f$_{esc}$ with both $z$ and M$_{UV}$. The LzLCS
suggest that fainter and lower mass galaxies dominate the ionizing photon
budget at higher redshift, possibly due to their rapidly evolving metal and
dust content. Finally, we use our correlation between $\beta$ and f$_{
esc}\times\xi_{ion}$ to predict the ionizing emissivity of galaxies during the
epoch of reionization. Our estimated emissivities match IGM observations, and
suggest that star-forming galaxies emit sufficient LyC photons into the IGM to
exceed recombinations near redshifts of 7-8.

studies focus only on a temperature dependence or even only a constant
effective shear viscosity. This work addresses this issue by studying
qualitatively the effect of a generalized $\eta/s$($T,\mu_B$) in the hybrid
approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the
(3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. In order to reduce the bias of the
result on the equation of state used in the hydrodynamic part of the model,
$\eta/s$ is parameterized directly in the energy density and net baryon number
density. The parameterization takes into account the constraints of matching to
the transport coefficients in the hadronic phase, as well as pQCD results. This
work compares the impact of the density dependence for different system sizes
and energies and compares the observables with experimental results in the RHIC

generalization is especially relevant for intermediate collision energies, for
which the system is in equilibrium for a relevant amount of time, but the net
baryochemical potential does not vanish. It is shown that the effect of an
explicit net baryon number dependence on the elliptic flow is negligible and
only relevant in the early stages of the collision. Additionally, we find that
the proposed parameterization could be a good proxy for the shear viscosity in

efficiency of the framework is illustrated by controlling emergent unstable (i)

requires to measure the gradients of time-averaged spin-polarization on the

spin-polarization on the SIS, thus makes it possible to directly characterize
the topological phases by introducing an extra quenching process. Moreover,
high-order SIS or band inversion surface (BIS) relying on the dimension
reduction approach, is also generalized to the above two different
characterization schemes. One can extract the topological invariant from pairs
of points with opposite signs both on the 0D highest order BIS and on the 0D
highest order SIS, which greatly simplifies the measurement strategy and
characterization process. In a word, superior to the sudden quench protocol, we
demonstrate that the topological invariant can be captured not only by the
topological information on BIS, but also on the SIS. In particular, direct

microelectronic devices often affect the electronic performance, resistance to
thermomechanical damage, and, likely, radiation tolerance. A primary challenge
for characterization of these concentrations is that they exist over sub-$\mu$m
length-scales, precluding their characterization by more traditional residual
stress measurement techniques. Here we demonstrate the use of synchrotron X-ray
-based differential aperture X-ray microscopy (DAXM) as a viable,
non-destructive means to characterize these stress and strain concentrations in
a depth-resolved manner. DAXM is used to map two-dimensional strain fields
between source and drain in a gallium nitride (GaN) layer within high electron
mobility transistors (HEMTs) with sub-$\mu$m spatial resolution. Strain fields
at various positions in both pristine and irradiated HEMT specimens are
presented in addition to a preliminary stress analysis to estimate the
distribution of various stress components within the GaN layer.
$\gamma$-irradiation is found to significantly reduce the lattice plane spacing
in the GaN along the sample normal direction which is attributed to radiation
damage in transistor components bonded to the GaN during irradiation.

our well-being as well as the development of interactive social agents. Prior
research directly studying the quality of social conversations has
operationalized it in narrow terms, associating greater quality to less small
talk. Other works taking a broader perspective of interaction experience have
indirectly studied quality through one of the several overlapping constructs
such as rapport or engagement, in isolation. In this work we bridge this gap by
proposing a holistic conceptualization of conversation quality, building upon
the collaborative attributes of cooperative conversation floors. Taking a
multilevel perspective of conversation, we develop and validate two instruments
for perceived conversation quality (PCQ) at the individual and group levels.
Specifically, we motivate capturing external raters' gestalt impressions of
participant experiences from thin slices of behavior, and collect annotations
of PCQ on the publicly available MatchNMingle dataset of in-the-wild mingling
conversations. Finally, we present an analysis of behavioral features that are
predictive of PCQ. We find that for the conversations in MatchNMingle, raters
tend to associate smaller group sizes, equitable speaking turns with fewer
interruptions, and time taken for synchronous bodily coordination with higher
PCQ.

Generalised Kolmogorov Equations (AGKE), exact budget equations for the
second-order structure function tensor in the space of scales and in the
physical space. Scale-space energy fluxes show that forward and reverse energy
transfers simultaneously occur in the flow, with interesting modelling
implications.
  Over the longitudinal cylinder side, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the
leading-edge shear layer generates large spanwise rolls, which get stretched
into hairpin-like vortices and eventually break down into smaller streamwise
vortices. Independent sources of velocity fluctuations act at different scales.
The flow dynamics is dominated by pressure-strain: the flow impingement on the
cylinder surface in the reattachment zone produces spanwise velocity
fluctuations very close to the wall and, at larger wall distances, reorients
them to feed streamwise-aligned vortices.
  In the near wake, large von K\`arm\`an-like vortices are shed from the
trailing edge and coexist with smaller turbulent structures, each with its own
independent production mechanism. At the trailing edge, the sudden
disappearance of the wall changes the structure of turbulence: streamwise
vortices progressively vanish, while spanwise structures close to the wall are
suddenly turned into vertical fluctuations by the pressure strain.

To address this data gap, a promising approach is to perform automated dam
reservoir extraction based on globally available remote sensing imagery. It can
be considered as a fine-grained task of water body extraction, which involves
extracting water areas in images and then separating dam reservoirs from
natural water bodies. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based
pipeline that decomposes dam reservoir extraction into water body segmentation
and dam reservoir recognition. Water bodies are firstly separated from
background lands in a segmentation model and each individual water body is then
predicted as either dam reservoir or natural water body in a classification
model. For the former step, point-level metric learning with triplets across
images is injected into the segmentation model to address contour ambiguities
between water areas and land regions. For the latter step, prior-guided metric
learning with triplets from clusters is injected into the classification model
to optimize the image embedding space in a fine-grained level based on
reservoir clusters. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark

those making their first steps in synthetic data generation, to more
experienced ones with domain expertise who can configure different aspects of
the modelling and contribute new methods/mechanisms. Specific instances of

getting deployed in high-stake applications, such as justice system,
drug/vaccination design, and medical diagnosis. Although there are effective
methods to train fair models from scratch, how to automatically reveal and
explain the unfairness of a trained model remains a challenging task. Revealing
unfairness of machine learning models in interpretable fashion is a critical
step towards fair and trustworthy AI. In this paper, we systematically tackle
the novel task of revealing unfair models by mining interpretable evidence
(RUMIE). The key idea is to find solid evidence in the form of a group of data
instances discriminated most by the model. To make the evidence interpretable,
we also find a set of human-understandable key attributes and decision rules
that characterize the discriminated data instances and distinguish them from
the other non-discriminated data. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on
many real-world data sets, our method finds highly interpretable and solid
evidence to effectively reveal the unfairness of trained models. Moreover, it
is much more scalable than all of the baseline methods.

highly dependent on its mass-loss history and geometry, with the yellow
hypergiants being key objects to study those phases of evolution. We present
near-IR interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant IRC +10420
and blue spectra taken between 1994-2019. Our 2.2 $\mu$m GRAVITY/VLTI
observations attain a spatial resolution of $\sim$5 stellar radii and probe the
hot emission in the K-band tracing the gas via Na i double emission and the
Br$\gamma$ emission. The observed configurations spatially resolve the 2.2
$\mu$m continuum as well as the Br$\gamma$ and the Na i emission lines. Our
geometric modelling demonstrates the presence of a compact neutral zone (Na i)
which is slightly larger than the continuum but within an extended Br$\gamma$
emitting region. Our geometric models of the Br$\gamma$ emission confirm an
hour-glass geometry of the wind. To explain this peculiar geometry we
investigate the presence of a companion at 7-800 au separations and find no
signature at the contrast limit of our observations (3.7 mag at 3$\sigma$). We
report an evolution of the ejecta over a time span of 7 years, which allows us
to constrain the opening angle of the hour-glass geometry at $<$10$^\circ$.
Lastly, we present the first blue optical spectra of IRC +10420 since 1994. The
multi-epoch data indicate that the spectral type, and thus temperature, of the
object has essentially remained constant during the intervening years. This
confirms earlier conclusions that following an increase in temperature of 2000
K in less than two decades prior to 1994, the temperature increase has halted.
This suggests that this yellow hypergiant has ""hit"" the White Wall in the
HR-diagram preventing it from evolving blue-wards, and will likely undergo a
major mass-loss event in the near future.

recent decades, despite its significance for integrating renewable electricity
into the energy system. A hydrogen network which reuses the existing fossil gas
network could not only help to supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could
also to balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and
thus avoid power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed
expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO2 scenarios for a
sector-coupled and self-sufficient European energy system with high shares of
renewables. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture, and
industry sectors across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With
this high spatio-temporal resolution, the model can capture bottlenecks in
transmission networks, the variability of demand and renewable supply, as well
as regional opportunities for the retrofitting of legacy gas infrastructure and
the development of geological hydrogen storage. Our results show consistent
system cost reductions with a pan-continental hydrogen network that connects
regions with low-cost and abundant renewable potentials to demand centres,
synthetic fuel production and cavern storage sites. Developing a hydrogen
network reduces system costs by up to 26 billion Euros per year (3.4%), with
the highest benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised.
Between 64% and 69% of this network could be built from repurposed natural gas
pipelines. However, we find that hydrogen networks can only partially
substitute for power grid expansion. While the expansion of both networks
together can achieve the largest cost savings of 10%, the expansion of neither
is truly essential as long as higher costs can be accepted and regulatory
changes are made to manage grid bottlenecks.

their photometry; a data-model characterizing the observation and calibration

framework for drawing robust inferences about the statistical properties of the

comfortably accurate enough for Stage III cosmological surveys -- without any

applications (e.g., cellular network configuration, dynamic pricing, and policy
selection) where an action taken by a central entity influences a large
population that contributes to the global reward. However, collecting such
reward feedback from the entire population not only incurs a prohibitively high
cost but often leads to privacy concerns. To tackle this problem, we consider
differentially private distributed linear bandits, where only a subset of users
from the population are selected (called clients) to participate in the
learning process and the central server learns the global model from such
partial feedback by iteratively aggregating these clients' local feedback in a
differentially private fashion. We then propose a unified algorithmic learning
framework, called differentially private distributed phased elimination
(DP-DPE), which can be naturally integrated with popular differential privacy
(DP) models (including central DP, local DP, and shuffle DP). Furthermore, we
prove that DP-DPE achieves both sublinear regret and sublinear communication
cost. Interestingly, DP-DPE also achieves privacy protection ""for free"" in the
sense that the additional cost due to privacy guarantees is a lower-order
additive term. In addition, as a by-product of our techniques, the same results

cuboid-level self-attention in parallel. These cuboids are further connected
with a collection of global vectors. We conduct experiments on the MovingMNIST

With future observations promising ever improving SZ measurements, the
relativistic corrections to the SZ signals from galaxy groups and clusters are
increasingly relevant. As such, it is important to understand the differences
between three temperature measures: (a) the average relativistic SZ (rSZ)
temperature, (b) the mass-weighted temperature relevant for the thermal SZ
(tSZ) effect, and (c) the X-ray spectroscopic temperature. In this work, we
compare these cluster temperatures, as predicted by the {\sc Bahamas} \& {\sc
Macsis}, {\sc Illustris-TNG}, {\sc Magneticum}, and {\sc The Three Hundred

the SZ temperatures are consistent across the simulations. We estimate a
$\simeq 10\%$ level correction from rSZ to clusters with
$Y\simeq10^{-4}$~Mpc$^{-2}$. Our analysis confirms a systematic offset between
the three temperature measures; with the rSZ temperature $\simeq 20\%$ larger
than the other measures, and diverging further at higher redshifts. We
demonstrate that these measures depart from simple self-similar evolution and
explore how they vary with the defined radius of haloes. We investigate how
different feedback prescriptions and resolution affect the observed
temperatures, and discover the SZ temperatures are rather insensitive to these
details. The agreement between simulations indicates an exciting avenue for
observational and theoretical exploration, determining the extent of
relativistic SZ corrections. We provide multiple simulation-based fits to the

drivers of road conditions may have a perverse effect of increasing congestion.
In the context of a simple (yet novel) model of V2V hazard information sharing,
we ask whether partial adoption of this technology can similarly lead to
undesirable outcomes. In our model, drivers individually choose how recklessly
to behave as a function of information received from other V2V-enabled cars,
and the resulting aggregate behavior influences the likelihood of accidents
(and thus the information propagated by the vehicular network). We fully
characterize the game-theoretic equilibria of this model. Our model indicates
that for a wide range of our parameter space, V2V information sharing
surprisingly increases the equilibrium frequency of accidents relative to no
V2V information sharing, and that it may increase equilibrium social cost as
well.

  Approach: A CMOS camera, gated to the UHDR LINAC, imaged the Cherenkov
emission profiles pulse by pulse passively during the irradiation of mice on
their limbs and intestinal region. The utility of an intensifier was
investigated for its effect on image quality including signal to noise and
spatial resolution. Pulse by pulse variability in Cherenkov emission profile
were quantified spatially and temporally.
  Main results: An intensifier improved the emission profile signal to noise
ratio from 15 to 280, with reduced spatial resolution. The profile extended
beyond of the treatment field due to the lateral scattering of the electrons in
tissue and its optical properties. The CMOS camera with an intensifier detected
the changes in Cherenkov emission profile during expiration and inspiration of
the respiration cycle for the mice to be about 3 mm.
  Significance: This fast imaging technique can be utilized for in vivo
intrafraction monitoring of FLASH patient treatments at single pulse
resolution. It can display delivery differences during respiration, and
variability in the delivered treatment's surface profile, which may perturb
from the intended UHDR treatment more for pencil beam scanning systems. The
technique may leverage Cherenkov emission surface profile to gate the treatment
delivery via respiratory gating systems under FLASH conditions.

in episodic tabular MDPs, both from a minimax and an instance-dependent view.
However, for the PAC RL problem, where the goal is to identify a near-optimal
policy with high probability, little is known about their instance-dependent
sample complexity. A negative result of Wagenmaker et al. (2021) suggests that
optimistic sampling rules cannot be used to attain the (still elusive) optimal
instance-dependent sample complexity. On the positive side, we provide the
first instance-dependent bound for an optimistic algorithm for PAC RL,
BPI-UCRL, for which only minimax guarantees were available (Kaufmann et al.,
2021). While our bound features some minimal visitation probabilities, it also
features a refined notion of sub-optimality gap compared to the value gaps that
appear in prior work. Moreover, in MDPs with deterministic transitions, we show
that BPI-UCRL is actually near-optimal. On the technical side, our analysis is
very simple thanks to a new ""target trick"" of independent interest. We
complement these findings with a novel hardness result explaining why the
instance-dependent complexity of PAC RL cannot be easily related to that of
regret minimization, unlike in the minimax regime.

crucial, as in the case of automated driving. Using formal mathematical methods
is one way to guarantee correctness. Though these methods have shown their
usefulness, care must be taken as modeling errors might result in proving a
faulty controller safe, which is potentially catastrophic in practice. This
paper deals with two such modeling errors in differential dynamic logic.
Differential dynamic logic is a formal specification and verification language
for hybrid systems, which are mathematical models of cyber-physical systems.
The main contribution is to prove conditions that when fulfilled, these two
modeling errors cannot cause a faulty controller to be proven safe. The
problems are illustrated with a real world example of a safety controller for
automated driving, and it is shown that the formulated conditions have the
intended effect both for a faulty and a correct controller. It is also shown
how the formulated conditions aid in finding a loop invariant candidate to
prove properties of hybrid systems with feedback loops. The results are proven

agencies have been exploring ways to support these decisions with empirical,
data-informed methods that include machine learning (ML). This paper describes
a conceptual framework for ML to support child welfare decisions. The ML
framework guides how child welfare agencies might conceptualize a target
problem that ML can solve; vet available administrative data for building ML;
formulate and develop ML specifications that mirror relevant populations and
interventions the agencies are undertaking; deploy, evaluate, and monitor ML as
child welfare context, policy, and practice change over time. Ethical
considerations, stakeholder engagement, and avoidance of common pitfalls
underpin the framework's impact and success. From abstract to concrete, we
describe one application of this framework to support a child welfare decision.
This ML framework, though child welfare-focused, is generalizable to solving

Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity coincides with a vector-tensor theory known as
khronometric gravity. The deviation of khronometric gravity from general
relativity can be parametrized by three coupling constants: $\alpha$, $\beta$,
and $\lambda$. Solar system experiments and gravitational wave observations
impose stringent bounds on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, while $\lambda$ is still
relatively unconstrained ($\lambda\lesssim 0.01$). In this paper, we study
whether one can constrain this remaining parameter with neutron star
observations through the universal I-Love-Q relations between the moment of
inertia (I), the tidal Love number (Love), and the quadrupole moment (Q), which
are insensitive to details in the nuclear matter equation of state. To do so,
we perturbatively construct slowly-rotating and weakly tidally-deformed neutron
stars in khronometric gravity. We find that the I-Love-Q relations are
independent of $\lambda$ in the limit $(\alpha,\beta) \to 0$. Although some
components of the field equations depend on $\lambda$, we show through
induction and a post-Minkowskian analysis that slowly-rotating neutron stars do
not depend on $\lambda$ at all. Tidally deformed neutron stars, on the other
hand, are modified in khronometric gravity (though the usual Love number is not
modified, as mentioned earlier), and there are potentially new, non-GR Love
numbers, though their observability is unclear. These findings indicate that it
may be difficult to constrain $\lambda$ with rotating/tidally-deformed neutron
stars.

the Windkessel model need to be tuned case by case to reflect patient-specific

search the parameter spaces by solving the flow circuit system with the
consideration of geometric resistances; (3) performing the multi-scale modeling

traditional grid search methods grows exponentially with the number of HPs

recent years. Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available online,
e.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a challenging
task for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior research on the
explaining quality of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics has
uncovered that the surface features provided by YouTube (e.g. number of views
or likes) do not seem to be suitable indicators of the videos' explaining
quality. Instead, the number of content-related comments was found to be
statistically significantly correlated with the explaining quality. To date,
these findings have only been observed in the context of explanatory videos on
classical mechanics topics. The question arises whether similar correlations
between the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found for
videos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally, for
example from quantum physics. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study
analyzing the explaining quality of N = 60 YouTube videos on quantum
entanglement and tunnelling. To this end, we made use of a category-based
measure of explanatory videos' explaining quality from the literature. We
report correlations between the videos' explaining quality, and the surface
features provided by YouTube. On the one hand, our results substantiate earlier
findings for mechanics topics. On other hand, partial correlations shed new
light on the relationship between YouTube's surface features and explaining

de-alias undersampled acquisitions to recover images consistent with
fully-sampled data. Since conditional models are trained with knowledge of the
imaging operator, they can show poor generalization across variable operators.
Unconditional models instead learn generative image priors decoupled from the
imaging operator to improve reliability against domain shifts. Recent diffusion
models are particularly promising given their high sample fidelity.
Nevertheless, inference with a static image prior can perform suboptimally.
Here we propose the first adaptive diffusion prior for MRI reconstruction,
AdaDiff, to improve performance and reliability against domain shifts. AdaDiff
leverages an efficient diffusion prior trained via adversarial mapping over
large reverse diffusion steps. A two-phase reconstruction is executed following
training: a rapid-diffusion phase that produces an initial reconstruction with
the trained prior, and an adaptation phase that further refines the result by
updating the prior to minimize reconstruction loss on acquired data.
Demonstrations on multi-contrast brain MRI clearly indicate that AdaDiff
outperforms competing conditional and unconditional methods under domain
shifts, and achieves superior or on par within-domain performance.

fluctuations in stochastic processes in networks, we investigated diffusive
persistence in various graphs. Global diffusive persistence is defined as the
fraction of nodes for which the diffusive field at a site (or node) has not
changed sign up to time $t$ (or in general, that the node remained
active/inactive in discrete models). Here we investigate disordered and random
networks and show that the behavior of the persistence depends on the topology
of the network. In two-dimensional (2D) disordered networks, we find that above
the percolation threshold diffusive persistence scales similarly as in the
original 2D regular lattice, according to a power law $P(t,L)\sim t^{-\theta}$
with an exponent $\theta \simeq 0.186$, in the limit of large linear system
size $L$. At the percolation threshold, however, the scaling exponent changes
to $\theta \simeq 0.141$, as the result of the interplay of diffusive
persistence and the underlying structural transition in the disordered lattice
at the percolation threshold. Moreover, studying finite-size effects for 2D
lattices at and above the percolation threshold, we find that at the
percolation threshold, the long-time asymptotic value obeys a power-law
$P(t,L)\sim L^{-z\theta}$ with $z\simeq 2.86$ instead of the value of $z=2$
normally associated with finite-size effects on 2D regular lattices. In

blind and conventional deconvolution improved mass measurements nearly equally

on the environmental conditions, thermal convection can occur and may be

penetrate into the porous medium, forming deep cells. Here, we combine three
complementary approaches -- linear stability analysis, fully nonlinear
numerical simulations, and a coarse-grained model -- to determine the
circumstances that lead to each configuration. The coarse-grained model yields
an explicit formula for the transition between deep and shallow convection in
the physically relevant limit of small Darcy number. Near the onset of
convection, all three of the approaches agree, validating the predictive
capability of the explicit formula. The numerical simulations extend these
results into the strongly nonlinear regime, revealing novel hybrid
configurations in which the flow exhibits a dynamic shift from shallow to deep

preferred steady-state of deep convection. We construct a phase diagram that

(EHRs) has driven various advancements in the modern healthcare-industry. In
many cases, patients need to share their EHR with healthcare professionals.
Given the sensitive and security-critical nature of EHRs, it is essential to
consider the security and privacy issues of storing and sharing EHR. However,
existing security solutions excessively encrypt the whole database, thus
requiring the entire database to be decrypted for each access request, which is
a time-consuming process. On the other hand, the use of EHR for medical
research (e.g., development of precision-medicine, diagnostics-techniques), as
well as optimisation of practices in healthcare organisations, requires the EHR
to be analysed, and for that, they should be easily accessible without
compromising the privacy of the patient. In this paper, we propose an efficient
technique called E-Tenon that not only securely keeps all EHR publicly
accessible but also provides the desirable security features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work in which an Open Database is used for
protecting EHR. The proposed E-Tenon empowers patients to securely share their
EHR under multi-level, fine-grained access policies defined by themselves.
Analyses show that our system outperforms existing solutions in terms of
computational-complexity.

video codecs directly use the ready-made entropy model from image codec to
encode the residual or motion, and do not fully leverage the spatial-temporal

model which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. In
particular, we introduce the latent prior which exploits the correlation among
the latent representation to squeeze the temporal redundancy. Meanwhile, the
dual spatial prior is proposed to reduce the spatial redundancy in a
parallel-friendly manner. In addition, our entropy model is also versatile.
Besides estimating the probability distribution, our entropy model also
generates the quantization step at spatial-channel-wise. This content-adaptive
quantization mechanism not only helps our codec achieve the smooth rate
adjustment in single model but also improves the final rate-distortion
performance by dynamic bit allocation. Experimental results show that, powered
by the proposed entropy model, our neural codec can achieve 18.2% bitrate
saving on UVG dataset when compared with H.266 (VTM) using the highest

generalized Bayesian virtual sensing technique which combines a physics-driven
model of the structure with a data-driven model of latent variables of the
system to extrapolate unmeasured strain states. In the GPLFM, modeling of
unknown sources of excitation as a Gaussian process (GP) serves to facilitate
strain estimation by providing a complete stochastic characterization of the
covariance relationship between input forces and states, using properties of
the GP covariance kernel as well as correlation information supplied by the
mechanical model. It is shown that posterior inference of the latent inputs and
states is performed by Gaussian process regression of measured accelerations,
computed efficiently using Kalman filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing

input fluid of lower density and lower viscosity in a horizontal porous layer.
If the two fluids have been vertically segregated by buoyancy, the flow becomes
self-similar with the input fluid preferentially flowing near the upper
boundary. We show that this axisymmetric self-similar flow is stable to
angular-dependent perturbations for any viscosity ratio. The Saffman-Taylor
instability is suppressed due to the buoyancy segregation of the fluids. The
radial extent of the segregated current is inversely proportional to the
viscosity ratio. This horizontal extension of the intrusion eliminates the
discontinuity in the pressure gradient between the fluids associated with the
viscosity contrast. Hence, at late times viscous fingering is shut down even
for arbitrarily small density differences. The stability is confirmed through
numerical integration of a coupled problem for the interface shape and the
pressure gradient, and through complementary asymptotic analysis, which
predicts the decay rate for each mode. The results are extended to anisotropic
and vertically heterogeneous layers. The interface may have steep shock-like
regions but the flow is always stable when the fluids have been segregated by
buoyancy, as in a uniform layer.

information of the historical frames into a latent space, and the second one is
employed to predict the human posture for the next frame. Moreover, our
framework contains two Transformer-based controllers, which are used to model
the constraints of the root trajectory and the velocity factor respectively, so
as to better utilize the temporal context of the frames and achieve
fine-grained motion control. We verify the proposed approach on a dance dataset

  incompressible flows",,,"10.1016/j.physd.2023.133730",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new physical concept referred to as the
wall-normal Lamb dilatation flux (WNLDF), which is defined as the wall-normal
derivative of the Lamb dilatation (namely, the divergence of the Lamb vector)
multiplied by the dynamic viscosity for incompressible viscous flows. It is
proved that the boundary Lamb dilatation flux (BLDF, namely the wall-normal
Lamb dilatation flux at the wall) is determined by the boundary enstrophy flux
(BEF) and the surface curvature-induced contribution. As the first step to
explore this new concept, the present study only considers flow past a
stationary no-slip flat wall without curvature-fluid dynamic coupling effects.
It is found that the temporal-spatial evolution rate of the WNLDF is
contributed by four source terms, which can be explicitly expressed using the
fundamental surface quantities including skin friction (or surface vorticity)
and surface pressure. Therefore, the instantaneous near-wall flow structures
are directly related to the WNLDF in both laminar and turbulent flows. As an
example, for the turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\tau}=180$, the intensification
of the temporal-spatial evolution rate of the WNLDF is caused by the strong
wall-normal velocity event (SWNVE) associated with quasi-streamwise vortices
and high intermittency of the viscous sublayer. In addition, near the SWNVE,
this evolution rate is mainly contributed by the coupling between skin friction
and the boundary enstrophy gradient, as well as the coupling between the skin
friction divergence and the boundary enstrophy. The exact results presented in
this paper could provide new physical insights into complex near-wall flows.

comparable to the integrated intensity ratio. This result indicates that both
CO(1--0) and CO(2--1) lines trace similar components of molecular gas, with
their integrated intensity (or peak temperature) ratios reflecting the gas
density and/or temperature. Similar to recent kpc scale studies, these ratios
show a positive correlation with a star formation rate indicator (here we use
an extinction-corrected H-alpha map), suggesting that molecular gas associated
with recent star formation is denser and/or warmer. We also find that some CO
spectra show two peaks owing to complicated kinematics, and such two components
likely trace molecular gas at different conditions. This result demonstrates
the importance of spectral fitting to measure integrated intensities and their

systems. Herein, second moment polytopic (SMP) systems are proposed that
generalize systems with both uncertainty and randomness. The SMP systems are
characterized by second moments of the stochastic system matrices and the
uncertain parameters. Further, a fundamental theory for guaranteeing stability
of the SMP systems is established. It is challenging to analyze the SMP systems
owing to both the uncertainty and randomness. An idea to overcome this
difficulty is to expand the SMP systems and exclude the randomness. Because the
expanded systems contain only the uncertainty, their stability can be analyzed
via robust stability theory. The stability of the expanded systems is
equivalent to statistical stability of the SMP systems. These facts provide
sufficient conditions for the stability of the SMP systems as linear matrix
inequalities (MIs). In controller design for the SMP systems, the linear MIs
reduce to cubic MIs whose solutions correspond to feedback gains. The cubic MIs
are transformed into simpler quadratic MIs that can be solved using
optimization techniques. Moreover, solving such non-convex MIs is relaxed into
the iteration of a convex optimization. Solutions to the iterative optimization
provide feedback gains that stabilize the SMP systems. As demonstrated here,
the SMP systems represent linear dynamics with uncertain mean and covariance
and other existing systems such as independently identically distributed
dynamics and random polytopes. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

the CPD gas temperature and mass. We find that the CPD temperature is
$\gtrsim35$ K, higher than the circumstellar disk temperature at the radial
location of the CPD, 22 K, suggesting that heating sources localized to the CPD

of millimeter continuum emission at the location of the CPD ($3\sigma$ flux

  Pre-trained Models",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the Chinese pre-trained models adopt characters as basic units for
downstream tasks. However, these models ignore the information carried by words
and thus lead to the loss of some important semantics. In this paper, we
propose a new method to exploit word structure and integrate lexical semantics
into character representations of pre-trained models. Specifically, we project
a word's embedding into its internal characters' embeddings according to the
similarity weight. To strengthen the word boundary information, we mix the
representations of the internal characters within a word. After that, we apply
a word-to-character alignment attention mechanism to emphasize important
characters by masking unimportant ones. Moreover, in order to reduce the error
propagation caused by word segmentation, we present an ensemble approach to
combine segmentation results given by different tokenizers. The experimental
results show that our approach achieves superior performance over the basic
pre-trained models BERT, BERT-wwm and ERNIE on different Chinese NLP tasks:
sentiment classification, sentence pair matching, natural language inference
and machine reading comprehension. We make further analysis to prove the
effectiveness of each component of our model.

years. However, there is little research on cross-age speaker verification
(CASV) due to insufficient relevant data. In this paper, we mine cross-age test
sets based on the VoxCeleb dataset and propose our age-invariant speaker
representation(AISR) learning method. Since the VoxCeleb is collected from the
YouTube platform, the dataset consists of cross-age data inherently. However,
the meta-data does not contain the speaker age label. Therefore, we adopt the
face age estimation method to predict the speaker age value from the associated
visual data, then label the audio recording with the estimated age. We
construct multiple Cross-Age test sets on VoxCeleb (Vox-CA), which deliberately
select the positive trials with large age-gap. Also, the effect of nationality
and gender is considered in selecting negative pairs to align with Vox-H cases.
The baseline system performance drops from 1.939\% EER on the Vox-H test set to
10.419\% on the Vox-CA20 test set, which indicates how difficult the cross-age
scenario is. Consequently, we propose an age-decoupling adversarial learning
(ADAL) method to alleviate the negative effect of the age gap and reduce
intra-class variance. Our method outperforms the baseline system by over 10\%
related EER reduction on the Vox-CA20 test set. The source code and trial

modern deep learning architectures. While it is well-understood that using
momentum can lead to faster convergence rate in various settings, it has also
been observed that momentum yields higher generalization. Prior work argue that
momentum stabilizes the SGD noise during training and this leads to higher
generalization. In this paper, we adopt another perspective and first
empirically show that gradient descent with momentum (GD+M) significantly
improves generalization compared to gradient descent (GD) in some deep learning
problems. From this observation, we formally study how momentum improves
generalization. We devise a binary classification setting where a one-hidden
layer (over-parameterized) convolutional neural network trained with GD+M
provably generalizes better than the same network trained with GD, when both
algorithms are similarly initialized. The key insight in our analysis is that
momentum is beneficial in datasets where the examples share some feature but
differ in their margin. Contrary to GD that memorizes the small margin data,
GD+M still learns the feature in these data thanks to its historical gradients.
Lastly, we empirically validate our theoretical findings.

the controlled spontaneous emission of trapped ions is implemented via pumping
the metastable states upwards to the short-lived ionic states by an auxiliary

Existing ReID methods adopting real-value feature descriptors have achieved
high accuracy, but they are low in efficiency due to the slow Euclidean
distance computation as well as complex quick-sort algorithms. Recently, some
works propose to yield binary encoded person descriptors which instead only
require fast Hamming distance computation and simple counting-sort algorithms.
However, the performances of such binary encoded descriptors, especially with
short code (e.g., 32 and 64 bits), are hardly satisfactory given the sparse
binary space. To strike a balance between the model accuracy and efficiency, we
propose a novel Sub-space Consistency Regularization (SCR) algorithm that can
speed up the ReID procedure by $0.25$ times than real-value features under the
same dimensions whilst maintaining a competitive accuracy, especially under
short codes. SCR transforms real-value features vector (e.g., 2048 float32)
with short binary codes (e.g., 64 bits) by first dividing real-value features
vector into $M$ sub-spaces, each with $C$ clustered centroids. Thus the
distance between two samples can be expressed as the summation of the
respective distance to the centroids, which can be sped up by offline
calculation and maintained via a look-up table. On the other side, these
real-value centroids help to achieve significantly higher accuracy than using
binary code. Lastly, we convert the distance look-up table to be integer and
apply the counting-sort algorithm to speed up the ranking stage.
  We also propose a novel consistency regularization with an iterative
framework. Experimental results on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID show promising
and exciting results. Under short code, our proposed SCR enjoys
Real-value-level accuracy and Hashing-level speed.

and adaptive adversary: (i) What is the minimal amount of instances required to
be Trojaned by a strong attacker? and (ii) Is it possible for such an attacker
to bypass strong detection mechanisms?
  We provide an analytical characterization of adversarial capability and
strategic interactions between the adversary and detection mechanism that take
place in such models. We characterize adversary capability in terms of the
fraction of the input dataset that can be embedded with a Trojan trigger. We
show that the loss function has a submodular structure, which leads to the
design of computationally efficient algorithms to determine this fraction with
provable bounds on optimality. We propose a Submodular Trojan algorithm to
determine the minimal fraction of samples to inject a Trojan trigger. To evade
detection of the Trojaned model, we model strategic interactions between the
adversary and Trojan detection mechanism as a two-player game. We show that the
adversary wins the game with probability one, thus bypassing detection. We
establish this by proving that output probability distributions of a Trojan
model and a clean model are identical when following the Min-Max (MM) Trojan
algorithm.
  We perform extensive evaluations of our algorithms on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
EuroSAT datasets. The results show that (i) with Submodular Trojan algorithm,
the adversary needs to embed a Trojan trigger into a very small fraction of

differentiable programs and define its semantics using concepts from
distribution theory, a well-established area of functional analysis. We also
show how $\lambda_\delta$ presents better equational properties than other
existing semantics and use our semantics to reason about a simplified ray

Additionally, we numerically study two implications of the implicit

generalization. Firstly, we find that input weights of hidden neurons tend to
condense on isolated orientations trained with dropout. Condensation is a
feature in the non-linear learning process, which makes the network less

to the neural network with a flatter minimum compared with standard gradient

densities of dark matter and dark energy, this parametric approach for
interacting dark sectors are inspired by our previous work concerning the
coupled generalized three-form dark energy model in which dark matter and dark
energy behave like two uncoupled dark sectors with effective equation of state
when the three-form $|\kappa X|\gg1$, for this reason, we reconstruct coupled
generalized three-form dark energy from such parametric model under the
condition $|\kappa X_0|\gg1$. In the end, we place constraints on the
parametric model with the coupled generalized three-form dark energy model

the BOSS Data Release (DR) 12, Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SN

R20, the parametric model relieves the Hubble tension to 0.05$\sigma$ with
$\chi_{\rm min}^2=6.70$ and the coupled generalized three-form dark energy
model relieves the Hubble tension to 0.70$\sigma$ with $\chi_{\rm min}^2=9.02$.
However, it is worth noting that the tiny Hubble tension between R20 and the
parametric model is mostly due to the fact that the introduction of the

symmetry characterizes the ""fracton"" quasiparticles and identifies a theory
which depends on a dimensionless parameter, which cannot be reabsorbed by a
redefinition of the tensor field, despite the fact that the theory is free of
interactions. This kind of ""electromagnetic gauge symmetry"" is weaker that the

contains, but is not limited to, linearized gravity, and we show how it is
possible to switch continuously from linearized gravity to a mixed phase where
both gravitons and fractons are present, without changing the degrees of
freedom of the theory. The gauge fixing procedure is particularly rich and
rather peculiar, and leads to the computation of propagators which in the
massive case we ask to be tachyonic-free, thus constraining the domain of the
parameter of the theory. Finally, a closer contact to fractons is made by the
introduction of a parameter related to the ""rate of propagation"". For a
particular value of this parameter the theory does not propagate at all, and we
guess that, for this reason, the resulting theory should be tightly related to
the fracton excitations.

visual tasks, we propose an Iterative Transductive OSR framework, called
IT-OSR, which implements three explored modules iteratively, including a
reliability sampling module, a feature generation module, and a baseline update
module. Specifically, at each iteration, a dual-space consistent sampling
approach is presented in the explored reliability sampling module for selecting
some relatively more reliable ones from the test samples according to their
pseudo labels assigned by a baseline method, which could be an arbitrary
inductive OSR method. Then, a conditional dual-adversarial generative network
under an orthogonal coding condition is designed in the feature generation
module to generate discriminative sample features of both known and unknown
classes according to the selected test samples with their pseudo labels.
Finally, the baseline method is updated for sample re-prediction in the
baseline update module by jointly utilizing the generated features, the
selected test samples with pseudo labels, and the training samples. Extensive
experimental results on both the standard-dataset and the cross-dataset
settings demonstrate that the derived transductive methods, by introducing two
typical inductive OSR methods into the proposed IT-OSR framework, achieve
better performances than 15 state-of-the-art methods in most cases.

lack of direct measurements of high-order correlation functions. Such
measurements would exceed conventional single-particle spectroscopies and
perturbative responses to fully characterize quantum states
far-from-equilibrium. Particularly, sensing of the exotic collective modes that
would uniquely characterize lightwave-driven SC coherence, in a way analogous
to the Meissner effect, is very challenging but much needed. Here we report the
discovery of lightwave-controlled superconductivity via parametric
time-periodic driving of the strongly-coupled bands in iron-based
superconductors by a unique phase-amplitude collective mode assisted by
broken-symmetry THz supercurrents. We are able to measure non-perturbative,
high-order correlations in this strongly-driven superconductivity by separating
the THz multi-dimensional coherent spectra into conventional pump-probe, Higgs
collective mode, and pronounced bi--Higgs frequency sideband peaks with highly
nonlinear field dependence. We attribute the drastic transition in the coherent
spectra to parametric excitation of time-dependent pseudo--spin canting states
modulated by a phase-amplitude collective mode that manifests as a strongly
nonlinear shift from $\omega_\mathrm{Higgs}$ to 2$\omega_\mathrm{Higgs}$.
Remarkably, the latter higher--order sidebands dominate over the lower-order

for the $f(\mathcal{G},~T)$ gravity. In this gravitational theory, $f$ is an
arbitrary function of Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and the trace of the
energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ i.e., $T$. We start by introducing this
gravity theory in its usual geometrical representation and posteriorly obtain a
dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor demonstration on which the arbitrary
dependence on the generic function $f$ in both $\mathcal G$ and $T$ is
exchanged by two scalar fields and scalar potential. We then derive the JCs for
matching between two different space-times across a separation hyper-surface
$\Sigma$, assuming the matter sector to be described by an isotropic perfect
fluid configuration. We take the general approach assuming the possibility of a
thin-shell arising at $\Sigma$ between the two space-times. However, our
results establish that, for the distribution formalism to be well-defined,
thin-shells are not allowed to emerge in the general version of this theory. We
thus obtain instead a complete set of JCs for a smooth matching at $\Sigma$
under the same conditions. The same results are then obtained in the
scalar-tensor representation of the theory, thus emphasizing the equivalence
between these two representations. Our results significantly constrain the
possibility of developing models for alternative compact structures supported
by thin-shells in $f(\mathcal{G},~T)$ gravity, e.g. gravastars and thin-shell
wormholes, but provide a suitable framework for the search of models presenting
a smooth matching at their surface, from which perfect fluid stars are possible
examples.

equation, where the semi-classical gravity contributes a gravitational
potential term depending on the matter quantum state. This state-dependent
potential introduces the complexity of the quantum state evolution and
measurement in SN theory, which is different for different quantum measurement
prescriptions. Previous theoretical investigations on the SN-theory
phenomenology in the optomechanical experimental platform were carried out
under the so-called post/pre-selection prescription. This work will focus on
the phenomenology of SN theory under the causal-conditional prescription, which
fits the standard intuition on the continuous quantum measurement process.
Under the causal-conditional prescription, the quantum state of the test mass
mirrors is conditionally and continuously prepared by the projection of the
outgoing light field in the optomechanical system. Therefore a gravitational
potential depends on the quantum trajectory is created and further affects the
system evolution. In this work, we will systematically study various
experimentally measurable signatures of SN theory under the causal-conditional
prescription in an optomechanical system, for both the self-gravity and the
mutual gravity scenarios. Comparisons between the SN phenomenology under three
different prescriptions will also be carefully made. Moreover, we find that
quantum measurement can induce a classical correlation between two different
optical fields via classical gravity, which is difficult to be distinguished
from the quantum correlation of light fields mediated by quantum gravity.

multi-modality information (e.g., images and textual descriptions) is exploited
to improve the recommendation accuracy. Besides the user-item interaction
graph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (e.g.,
user-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations
of users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and
aggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be
prohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs.
Moreover, existing multi-modal recommendation methods usually leverage randomly
sampled negative examples in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to guide
the learning of user/item representations, which increases the computational
cost on large graphs and may also bring noisy supervision signals into the
training process. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
self-supervised multi-modal recommendation model, dubbed BM3, which requires
neither augmentations from auxiliary graphs nor negative samples. Specifically,
BM3 first bootstraps latent contrastive views from the representations of users
and items with a simple dropout augmentation. It then jointly optimizes three
multi-modal objectives to learn the representations of users and items by
reconstructing the user-item interaction graph and aligning modality features
under both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. BM3 alleviates both the need
for contrasting with negative examples and the complex graph augmentation from
an additional target network for contrastive view generation. We show BM3
outperforms prior recommendation models on three datasets with number of nodes
ranging from 20K to 200K, while achieving a 2-9X reduction in training time.

nucleons which include the chiral variant and invariant masses. Our model
expresses the $U(1)_A$ anomaly by the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t\,Hooft (KMT)
interaction in the mesonic sector. After examining the roles of the KMT term in
vacuum, we discuss its impacts on nuclear equations of state (EOS). The
$U(1)_A$ anomaly increases the masses of the $\eta'$ and $\sigma$ mesons and
enhances the chiral symmetry breaking. The $U(1)_A$ anomaly enlarges the energy
difference between chiral symmetric and symmetry broken vacuum; in turn, the
chiral restoration at high density adds a larger energy density (often referred
as a bag constant) to EOSs than in the case without the anomaly, leading to
softer EOSs. Including these $U(1)_A$ effects, we update the previously
constructed unified equations of state that interpolate the nucleonic EOS at
$n_B \le 2n_0$ ($n_{0} = 0.16\, \rm{fm^{-3}}$: nuclear saturation density) and
quark EOS at $n_B \ge 5n_0$. The unified EOS is confronted with the
observational constraints on the masses and radii of neutron stars. The
softening of EOSs associated with the $U(1)$ anomaly reduces the overall radii,
relaxing the previous constraint on the chiral invariant mass $m_0$. Including
the attractive nonlinear $\rho$-$\omega$ coupling to improved estimates for the
slope parameter in the symmetry energy, our new estimate is $400\,{\rm MeV}

light-emitting materials for their suitable band gaps in the visible spectrum.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing (semi)local
exchange-correlation functionals usually underestimate the band gaps for these
systems. Accurate descriptions of the electronic structures of HPs often demand
higher-order levels of theory such as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid
density functional and GW approximations that are much more computationally
expensive than standard DFT. Here, we investigate three representative types of
HPs, ABX3 halide perovskites, vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs), and
bond disproportionated halide perovskites (BDHPs), using DFT+U+V with onsite U
and intersite V Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently without a priori
assumption. The inclusion of Hubbard corrections improves the band gap
prediction accuracy for all three types of HPs to a similar level of advanced
methods. Moreover, the self-consistent Hubbard U is a meaningful indicator of
the true local charge state of multivalence metal atoms in HPs. The inclusion
of the intersite Hubbard V is crucial to properly capture the hybridization
between valence electrons on neighboring atoms in BDHPs that have
breathing-mode distortions of halide octahedra. In particular, the simultaneous
convergence of both Hubbard parameters and crystal geometry enables a band gap
prediction accuracy superior to HSE for BDHPs but at a fraction of the cost.
Our work highlights the importance of using self-consistent Huabbard parameters
when dealing with HPs that often possess intricate competitions between onsite
localization and intersite hybridization.

well-studied topic in algorithm design. Much of traditional caching research
studies cache management for a single-user or single-processor environment. In
this paper, we propose two related generalizations of the classical caching
problem that capture issues that arise in a multi-user or multi-processor
environment. In the caching with reserves problem, a caching algorithm is
required to maintain at least $k_i$ pages belonging to user $i$ in the cache at
any time, for some given reserve capacities $k_i$. In the public-private
caching problem, the cache of total size $k$ is partitioned into subcaches, a
private cache of size $k_i$ for each user $i$ and a shared public cache usable
by any user. In both of these models, as in the classical caching framework,
the objective of the algorithm is to dynamically maintain the cache so as to
minimize the total number of cache misses.
  We show that caching with reserves and public-private caching models are
equivalent up to constant factors, and thus focus on the former. Unlike
classical caching, both of these models turn out to be NP-hard even in the
offline setting, where the page sequence is known in advance. For the offline
setting, we design a 2-approximation algorithm, whose analysis carefully keeps
track of a potential function to bound the cost. In the online setting, we
first design an $O(\ln k)$-competitive fractional algorithm using the
primal-dual framework, and then show how to convert it online to a randomized
integral algorithm with the same guarantee.

certain probability and costs polynomial time in the length of the input

Specifically, given an $L$-bit integer $N$, we first randomly pick an integer
$a$ with $gcd(a,N)=1$, the order of $a$ modulo $N$ is the smallest positive
integer $r$ such that $a^r\equiv 1 (\bmod N)$. The order-finding algorithm in
Shor's algorithm first uses quantum operations to obtain an estimation of
$\dfrac{s}{r}$ for some $s\in\{0, 1, \cdots, r-1\}$, then $r$ is obtained by
means of classical algorithms. In this paper, we propose a distributed Shor's
algorithm. The difference between our distributed algorithm and the traditional
order-finding algorithm is that we use two quantum computers separately to
estimate partial bits of $\dfrac{s}{r}$ for some $s\in\{0, 1, \cdots, r-1\}$.
To ensure their measuring results correspond to the same $\dfrac{s}{r}$, we
need employ quantum teleportation. We integrate the measuring results via
classical post-processing. After that, we get an estimation of $\dfrac{s}{r}$

distribution networks (WDN) rely on mostly model- or toolbox-driven approaches,
where the network topology and parameters are assumed to be known. In contrast,
system identification (SysID) algorithms for generic dynamic system models seek
to approximate such models using only input-output data without relying on
network parameters. The objective of this paper is to investigate SysID
algorithms for water quality model approximation. This research problem is
challenging due to (i) complex water quality and reaction dynamics and (ii) the
mismatch between the requirements of SysID algorithms and the properties of
water quality dynamics. In this paper, we present the first attempt to identify
water quality models in WDNs using only input-output experimental data and
classical SysID methods without knowing any WDN parameters. Properties of water
quality models are introduced, the ensuing challenges caused by these
properties when identifying water quality models are discussed, and remedial
solutions are given. Through case studies, we demonstrate the applicability of
SysID algorithms, show the corresponding performance in terms of accuracy and
computational time, and explore the possible factors impacting water quality
model identification.

unsupervised learning framework for CO problems. Our framework follows a
standard relaxation-plus-rounding approach and adopts neural networks to
parameterize the relaxed solutions so that simple back-propagation can train
the model end-to-end. Our key contribution is the observation that if the
relaxed objective satisfies entry-wise concavity, a low optimization loss
guarantees the quality of the final integral solutions. This observation
significantly broadens the applicability of the previous framework inspired by
Erdos' probabilistic method. In particular, this observation can guide the
design of objective models in applications where the objectives are not given
explicitly while requiring being modeled in prior. We evaluate our framework by
solving a synthetic graph optimization problem, and two real-world applications
including resource allocation in circuit design and approximate computing. Our
framework largely outperforms the baselines based on na\""{i}ve relaxation,

hypercube can be used to solve many algebraic and geometric problems, most
importantly including the P-Matrix Linear Complementarity Problem and Linear
Programming. The realizable USOs are those that arise from the reductions of
these problems to the USO sink-finding problem. Finding the sink of realizable
USOs is thus highly practically relevant, yet it is unknown whether
realizability can be exploited algorithmically to find the sink more quickly.
However, all (non-trivial) known unconditional lower bounds for sink-finding
make use of USOs that are provably not realizable. This indicates that the
sink-finding problem might indeed be strictly easier on realizable USOs.
  In this paper we show that this is true for a subclass of all USOs. We
consider the class of Matou\v{s}ek-type USOs, which are a translation of
Matou\v{s}ek's LP-type problems into the language of USOs. We show a query
complexity gap between sink-finding in all, and sink-finding in only the
realizable $n$-dimensional Matou\v{s}ek-type USOs. We provide concrete
deterministic algorithms and lower bounds for both cases, and show that in the
realizable case $O(log^2 n)$ vertex evaluation queries suffice, while in
general exactly $n$ queries are needed. The Matou\v{s}ek-type USOs are the
first USO class found to admit such a gap.

generalize to novel test environments, we introduce the Brick Tic-Tac-Toe

shown to achieve superhuman performance in environments such as Go, Chess and
Shogi, which may lead one to think that it performs well in novel test

explore the generalizability of AlphaZero. We find that merely increasing MCTS
lookahead iterations was insufficient for AlphaZero to generalize to some novel
test environments. Rather, increasing the variety of training environments
helps to progressively improve generalizability across all possible starting

enhancing the sensitivity of solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
while bypassing the limitations faced by conventional (Overhauser) DNP at
magnetic fields of interest in analytical applications. Like Overhauser DNP,
JDNP also requires saturating the electronic polarization using high-frequency
microwaves, known to have poor penetration and associated heating effects in
most liquids. The present microwave-free JDNP (MF-JDNP) proposal seeks to
enhance the sensitivity of the solution state NMR by shuttling the sample
between higher and lower magnetic fields, with one of these fields providing an
electron Larmor frequency that matches the inter-electron exchange coupling
Jex. If spins cross this so-called JDNP condition sufficiently fast, we predict
that a sizable nuclear polarization will be created without microwave
irradiation. This MF-JDNP proposal requires radicals whose singlet/triplet
self-relaxation rates are dominated by dipolar hyperfine relaxation, and
shuttling times that can compete with these electron relaxation processes. This
communication discusses the theory behind the MF-JDNP, as well as proposals for
radicals and conditions that could enable this new approach to NMR sensitivity

progresses, first with a chronic phase, where the cells have enhanced
proliferation only, and then to a blast phase, where the cells have the ability
of self-renewal. It is well-recognized that the Philadelphia chromosome (which
contains the BCR-ABL fusion gene) is the ""hallmark of CML"". However, empirical
studies have shown that the mere presence of BCR-ABL may not be a sufficient
condition for the development of CML, and further modifications related to
tumor suppressors may be necessary. Accordingly, we develop a three-mutation
stochastic model of CML progression, with the three stages corresponding to the
non-malignant cells with BCR-ABL presence, the malignant cells in the chronic
phase and the malignant cells in the blast phase. We demonstrate that the model
predictions agree with age incidence data from the United States. Finally, we
develop a framework for the retrospective estimation of the time of onset of
malignancy, from the time of detection of the cancer.

Poisson structures relative to a not necessarily non-degenerate Ad-invariant
symmetric 2-tensor in the tensor square of g and one of general not necessarily
non-degenerate quasi Hamiltonian structures relative to a not necessarily
non-degenerate Ad-invariant symmetric bilinear form on g, a quasi Poisson
structure being given by a skew bracket of two variables such that suitable
data defined in terms of G as symmetry group involving the 2-tensor measure how
that bracket fails to satisfy the Jacobi identity. The present approach
involves a novel concept of momentum mapping and yields, in the non-degenerate
case, a bijective correspondence between non-degenerate quasi Poisson
structures and non-degenerate quasi Hamiltonian structures. The new theory
applies to various not necessarily non-singular moduli spaces and yields
thereupon, via reduction with respect to an appropriately defined momentum
mapping, not necessarily non-degenerate ordinary Poisson structures. Among
these moduli spaces are representation spaces, possibly twisted, of the
fundamental group of a Riemann surface, possibly punctured, and moduli spaces
of semistable holomorphic vector bundles as well as Higgs bundle moduli spaces.
In the non-degenerate case, such a Poisson structure comes down to a stratified
symplectic one of the kind explored in the literature and recovers, e.g., the
symplectic part of a K\""ahler structure introduced by Narasimhan and Seshadri
for moduli spaces of stable holomorphic vector bundles on a curve. In the
algebraic setting, these moduli spaces arise as not necessarily non-singular
affine not necessarily non-degenerate Poisson varieties. A side result is an
explicit equivalence between extended moduli spaces and quasi Hamiltonian
spaces independently of gauge theory.

the fundamental role of neural dynamics in shaping neural information

Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations under the pole-dipole approximation,
where the gravitational field and the higher multipoles of the particle are
neglected. Depending on the types of saddle points,the effective potential are
classified and the possibility of chaotic orbits is discussed. The inner most
stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of the spinning particle around SQBH are
addressed, as are the effects of the parameters $S$ (particles' spin) and
$\epsilon$ (equation of state parameter). Later, Periastron precession is
investigated up to the first-order spin correction for a spinning particle
moving in nearly circular orbits around SQBH. It is noted that the addition of
particle's spin revamps the results obtained for the non-spinning particles and
also articulates the some interesting observational properties of the SQBH.
Additionally, we discuss the ramifications of employing first-order spin
corrections for analysing ISCOs, as well as compare our results to the
Schwarzschild black hole to ensure that they are consistent in the limit when
equation of state parameter $\epsilon=-1/3$ and normalization factor $\alpha

However, we find the benefit brought by self-supervised pretraining on small

studies on the key components of GNN pretraining, including pretraining
objectives, data splitting methods, input features, pretraining dataset scales,

always have statistically significant advantages over non-pretraining methods
in many settings. Secondly, although noticeable improvement can be observed
with additional supervised pretraining, the improvement may diminish with
richer features or more balanced data splits. Thirdly, hyper-parameters could
have larger impacts on accuracy of downstream tasks than the choice of
pretraining tasks, especially when the scales of downstream tasks are small.
Finally, we provide our conjectures where the complexity of some pretraining

explore the possibility of using these powerful speaker attractors for
zero-shot speaker adaptation in multi-speaker TTS synthesis and propose speaker

peridynamics on arbitrarily--shaped two-dimensional (2D) closed manifolds is
proposed. When dealing with non parameterized 2D manifolds at the discrete
scale, the problem of computing geodesic distances between two non-adjacent
points arise. Here, a routing procedure is implemented for computing geodesic
distances by re-interpreting the triangular computational mesh as a
non-oriented graph; thus returning a suitable and general method. Moreover, the
time integration of the peridynamics equation is demanded to a P-(EC)$^k$
formulation of the implicit $\beta$-Newmark scheme. The convergence of the
overall proposed procedure is questioned and rigorously proved. Its abilities
and limitations are analyzed by simulating the evolution of a two-dimensional
sphere. The performed numerical investigations are mainly motivated by the
issues related to the insurgence of singularities in the evolution problem. The
obtained results return an interesting picture of the role played by the
nonlocal character of the integrodifferential equation in the intricate
processes leading to the spontaneous formation of singularities in real

loading conditions, without any new material parameter. Also developed herein
is an algorithm for implicit numerical solution of the extended Barton-Bandis
model, which can also be used for the original Barton-Bandis model for which an
implicit algorithm has been unavailable. To this end, we first cast the
Barton-Bandis model into an incremental elasto-plastic framework, deriving an
expression for the elastic shear stiffness being consistent with the original
model formulation. We then extend the model formulation to cyclic loading
conditions, incorporating the dependence of shear stress and dilation on the
joint position and the shearing direction. The extension is achieved by
introducing a few state-dependent variables which can be calculated with the
existing material parameters. For robust and accurate utilization of the model,
we also develop an implicit algorithm based on return mapping, which is
unconditionally stable and guarantees satisfaction of the strength criterion.
We verify that the proposed model formulation and algorithm produces the same
results as the original Barton-Bandis model under monotonic shearing
conditions. We then validate the extended Barton-Bandis model against
experimental data on natural rock joints under cycling loading conditions. The
present work thus enables the Barton-Bandis model, which has been exceptionally
popular in research and practice, to be applicable to a wider range of problems

Rigid transport is validated by computing the settling of a sphere under

considered. The steady deformation of a membrane under shear for three

attacks. To curb these attacks, most defense methods aim to improve the
robustness of recognition models against adversarial perturbations. However,
the generalization capacities of these methods are quite limited. In practice,
they are still vulnerable to unseen adversarial attacks. Deep learning models
are fairly robust to general perturbations, such as Gaussian noises. A
straightforward approach is to inactivate the adversarial perturbations so that
they can be easily handled as general perturbations. In this paper, a
plug-and-play adversarial defense method, named perturbation inactivation
(PIN), is proposed to inactivate adversarial perturbations for adversarial
defense. We discover that the perturbations in different subspaces have
different influences on the recognition model. There should be a subspace,
called the immune space, in which the perturbations have fewer adverse impacts
on the recognition model than in other subspaces. Hence, our method estimates
the immune space and inactivates the adversarial perturbations by restricting
them to this subspace. The proposed method can be generalized to unseen
adversarial perturbations since it does not rely on a specific kind of
adversarial attack method. This approach not only outperforms several
state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods but also demonstrates a superior
generalization capacity through exhaustive experiments. Moreover, the proposed
method can be successfully applied to four commercial APIs without additional

where the background field modification becomes more complicated, including
both trigonometric functions and the Bernoulli polynomials. These contributions
are non-vanishing and reproduce the correct limit as ${\cal Q} \rightarrow 0$.
In addition, the leading order contributions to the retarded/advanced gluon
self-energy and the next-to-leading order contributions to the symmetric gluon
self-energy are completely new as they only survive at ${\cal Q}\neq0$. Given
the above results, we explicitly verify that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger

multi-modal and multi-view scenarios. Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) aims to
group data by integrating complementary information from base kernels. As a
representative, late fusion MKC first decomposes the kernels into orthogonal
partition matrices, then learns a consensus one from them, achieving promising
performance recently. However, these methods fail to consider the noise inside
the partition matrix, preventing further improvement of clustering performance.
We discover that the noise can be disassembled into separable dual parts, i.e.
N-noise and C-noise (Null space noise and Column space noise). In this paper,
we rigorously define dual noise and propose a novel parameter-free MKC
algorithm by minimizing them. To solve the resultant optimization problem, we
design an efficient two-step iterative strategy. To our best knowledge, it is
the first time to investigate dual noise within the partition in the kernel
space. We observe that dual noise will pollute the block diagonal structures
and incur the degeneration of clustering performance, and C-noise exhibits
stronger destruction than N-noise. Owing to our efficient mechanism to minimize
dual noise, the proposed algorithm surpasses the recent methods by large
margins.

parameter-sensitive features in the existence of high noises were detected
using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Finally,
LASSO-MLPNet used a Multilayer Perceptron network (MLPNet) to estimate

effectiveness of the LASSO-MLPNet was evaluated on some LAMOST stellar spectra

demonstrate a regime transition from Rayleigh--B\'enard convection (RB) to
horizontal convection (HC) at $\Lambda\approx 10^{-2}$, which is independent of
$Ra_F$ and $\Gamma$. At small $\Lambda$, the flow is organized in multiple
overturning cells with approximately unit aspect ratio, while at large
$\Lambda$ a single cell is obtained. The RB-relevant Nusselt number scaling
with $Ra_F$ and the HC-relevant Nusselt number scaling with the horizontal
Rayleigh number $Ra_L=Ra_F\Lambda\Gamma^4$ are in good agreement with previous
results from classical RB convection and HC studies in the limit $\Lambda \ll

relations among them are established. In addition, we show that the standard

velocities for a statistically powerful sample of nearby galaxies. The
asymmetric features of these kinematics maps reflect the non-rotational
component of a galaxy's internal motion of ionized gas. In this study, we
present a catalog of kinematic asymmetry measurement of $H\alpha$ velocity map
of a sample of 5353 MaNGA galaxies. Based on this catalog, we find that
`special' galaxies (e.g. merging galaxies, barred galaxies, and AGN host
galaxies) contain more galaxies with highly asymmetric velocity maps. However,
we notice that more than half of galaxies with high kinematic asymmetry in our
sample are quite `regular'. For those `regular' galaxies, kinematic asymmetry
shows a significant anti-correlation with stellar mass at $\log M_\star < 9.7$,
while such a trend becomes very weak at $\log M_\star>9.7$. Moreover, at a
given stellar mass, the kinematic asymmetry shows weak correlations with
photometric morphology, star formation rate, and environment, while it is
independent of HI gas content. We also have quantified the observational
effects in the kinematic asymmetry measurement. We find that both the
signal-to-noise ratio of $H\alpha$ flux and disk inclination angle contribute
to the measures of kinematic asymmetry, while the physical spatial resolution
is an irrelevant factor inside the MaNGA redshift coverage.

sophistication of voice conversion, the style similarity of the converted
speech is still unsatisfactory. Inspired by the inherent structure of

Subband-based Generative Adversarial Network for Voice Conversion (SGAN-VC).
SGAN-VC converts each subband content of the source speech separately by
explicitly utilizing the spatial characteristics between different subbands.
SGAN-VC contains one style encoder, one content encoder, and one decoder. In
particular, the style encoder network is designed to learn style codes for
different subbands of the target speaker. The content encoder network can
capture the content information on the source speech. Finally, the decoder
generates particular subband content. In addition, we propose a pitch-shift

proposing several run-time optimizations on the reconstructed lines and planes.
Our system is able to run with depth and stereo sensors in addition to the
monocular setting. Our proposed SLAM tightly incorporates the semantic and
geometric features to boost both frontend pose tracking and backend map
optimization. We evaluate our system exhaustively on various datasets, and show
that we outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of trajectory precision.

because different species evaporate at different temperatures leaving distinct
signatures in the accreted atmosphere. The planetary C/O ratio is thought to
constrain the planet formation pathway, because of the condensation sequence of
H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO, resulting in an increase of the gas phase C/O
ratio with increasing distance. Here we use a disc evolution model including
pebble growth, drift and evaporation coupled with a planet formation model that
includes pebble and gas accretion as well as planet migration to compute the
atmospheric compositions of giant planets. We compare our results to the recent
observations of the hot Jupiters WASP-77A b and $\tau$ Bo\""otis b, which
feature sub-solar and super-solar C/H and O/H values, respectively. Our
simulations reproduce these measurements and show that giants like WASP-77A b
should start to form beyond the CO$_2$ evaporation front, while giants like
$\tau$ Bo\""otis b should originate from beyond the H$_2$O line. Our model
allows the formation of sub- and super-solar atmospheric compositions. However
simulations without pebble evaporation can not reproduce the super-solar C/H
and O/H ratios of $\tau$ Bo\""otis b's atmosphere without additional accretion
of solids. We identify the $\alpha$ viscosity parameter of the disc as a key
ingredient, because the viscosity drives the inward motion of volatile enriched
vapor, responsible for the accretion of gaseous C and O. Depending on the
planet's migration history order-of-magnitude differences in atmospheric C/H
and O/H are expected. Our simulations also predict super-solar N/H for $\tau$
Bo\""otis b and solar N/H for WASP-77A b. We conclude that pebble evaporation is
a key ingredient to explain the variety of exoplanet atmospheres, because it
can explain both, sub- and super-solar atmospheric abundances.

ability to generalize to under-represented classes. We empirically study a
convolutional neural network's internal representation of imbalanced image data
and measure the generalization gap between a model's feature embeddings in the
training and test sets, showing that the gap is wider for minority classes.
This insight enables us to design an efficient three-phase CNN training
framework for imbalanced data. The framework involves training the network
end-to-end on imbalanced data to learn accurate feature embeddings, performing
data augmentation in the learned embedded space to balance the train
distribution, and fine-tuning the classifier head on the embedded balanced
training data. We propose Expansive Over-Sampling (EOS) as a data augmentation
technique to utilize in the training framework. EOS forms synthetic training
instances as convex combinations between the minority class samples and their
nearest enemies in the embedded space to reduce the generalization gap. The
proposed framework improves the accuracy over leading cost-sensitive and
resampling methods commonly used in imbalanced learning. Moreover, it is more
computationally efficient than standard data pre-processing methods, such as
SMOTE and GAN-based oversampling, as it requires fewer parameters and less
training time.

decay rate computed in the CIPT and FOPT expansion approaches can be understood
from the fact that CIPT has an infrared (IR) sensitivity that it not compatible
with the standard form of the operator production expansion (OPE). For concrete
IR renormalon models for the QCD Adler function the resulting CIPT-FOPT
discrepancy, the asymptotic separation, can be calculated analytically from the
Borel representation of the CIPT series expansion. If the known perturbative
corrections for the QCD Adler function at the 5-loop level already have a
sizeable contribution from the asymptotic behavior related to the gluon
condensate (GC) renormalon, the asymptotic separation is dominated by that
renormalon. This implies that the CIPT expansion can be reconciled with FOPT,
when a renormalon-free scheme for the GC is adopted. In this talk we discuss
such a renormalon-free scheme for the GC, which involves perturbative
subtractions in analogy to using short-distance quark mass schemes instead of
the pole mass. Using a concrete realistic high-order Borel model for the Adler
function consistent with the known corrections up to 5 loops and containing a
sizeable GC renormalon contribution, we show that the CIPT-FOPT discrepancy can
be avoided when switching to the renormalon-free GC scheme. At the same time,
the perturbative convergence of $\tau$ hadronic spectral funtion moments
strongly sensitive to the GC OPE corrections is considerably improved. We show
that these improvements may lead to higher precision for strong coupling

multicomputer (CGM) model using the four-splitting technique to solve the
optimal binary search tree problem. The well-known sequential algorithm of
Knuth solves this problem in $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2\right)$ time and space,
where $n$ is the number of keys used to build the optimal binary search tree.
To parallelize this algorithm on the CGM model, the irregular partitioning
technique, consisting in subdividing the dependency graph into subgraphs (or
blocks) of variable size, has been proposed to tackle the trade-off of
minimizing the number of communication rounds and balancing the load of
processors. This technique however induces a high latency time of processors
(which accounts for most of the global communication time) because varying the
blocks' sizes does not enable them to start evaluating some blocks as soon as
the data they need are available. The four-splitting technique proposed in this
paper solves this shortcoming by evaluating a block as a sequence of
computation and communication steps of four subblocks. This CGM-based parallel
solution requires $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2/\sqrt{p} \right)$ execution time with
$\mathcal{O}\left( k \sqrt{p}\right)$ communication rounds, where $p$ is the
number of processors and $k$ is the number of times the size of blocks is
subdivided. An experimental study conducted to evaluate the performance of this
CGM-based parallel solution showed that compared to the solution based on the
irregular partitioning technique where the speedup factor is up to
$\times$10.39 on one hundred and twenty-eight processors with 40960 keys when

decisions that affect a broad range of groups in society. ML models inform
decisions in criminal justice, the extension of credit in banking, and the
hiring practices of corporations. This posits the requirement of model
fairness, which holds that automated decisions should be equitable with respect
to protected features (e.g., gender, race, or age) that are often
under-represented in the data. We postulate that this problem of
under-representation has a corollary to the problem of imbalanced data
learning. This class imbalance is often reflected in both classes and protected
features. For example, one class (those receiving credit) may be
over-represented with respect to another class (those not receiving credit) and
a particular group (females) may be under-represented with respect to another
group (males). A key element in achieving algorithmic fairness with respect to
protected groups is the simultaneous reduction of class and protected group
imbalance in the underlying training data, which facilitates increases in both
model accuracy and fairness. We discuss the importance of bridging imbalanced
learning and group fairness by showing how key concepts in these fields overlap
and complement each other; and propose a novel oversampling algorithm, Fair
Oversampling, that addresses both skewed class distributions and protected
features. Our method: (i) can be used as an efficient pre-processing algorithm
for standard ML algorithms to jointly address imbalance and group equity; and
(ii) can be combined with fairness-aware learning algorithms to improve their
robustness to varying levels of class imbalance. Additionally, we take a step
toward bridging the gap between fairness and imbalanced learning with a new
metric, Fair Utility, that combines balanced accuracy with fairness.

area of research for the past decade. Most of the early schemes are based on
classic Nyquist pulse shaping that was originally intended for linear channels.
The best known classic scheme, the split digital back-propagation (DBP), uses
joint pre-distortion and post equalization and hence, a nonlinear transmitter
(TX); it, however, suffers from spectral broadening on the fiber due to the
Kerr-effect. With the advent of deep learning in communications, it has been
realized that an Autoencoder can learn to communicate efficiently over the
optical fiber channel, jointly optimizing geometric constellations and pulse
shaping - while also taking into account linear and nonlinear impairments such
as chromatic dispersion and Kerr-nonlinearity. E.g., arXiv:2006.15027 shows how
an Autoencoder can learn to mitigate spectral broadening due to the Kerr-effect
using a trainable linear TX. In this paper, we extend this linear architectural
template to a scalable nonlinear pulse shaping consisting of a Convolutional
Neural Network at both transmitter and receiver. By introducing a novel
$\gamma$-lifting training procedure tailored to the nonlinear optical fiber
channel, we achieve stable Autoencoder convergence to pulse shapes reaching
information rates outperforming the classic split DBP reference at high input
powers.

has various intriguing fundamental properties which require experimental
verification, such as the asymptotic robustness to environmental noise. Here,
we experimentally investigate quantum discord in propagating two-mode squeezed
microwave states generated via superconducting Josephson parametric amplifiers.
By exploiting an asymmetric noise injection into these entangled states, we
demonstrate the robustness of quantum discord against thermal noise while
verifying the sudden death of entanglement. Furthermore, we investigate the
difference between quantum discord and entanglement of formation, which can be
directly related to the flow of locally inaccessible information between the
environment and the bipartite subsystem. We observe a crossover behavior
between quantum discord and entanglement for low noise photon numbers, which is
a result of the tripartite nature of noise injection. We demonstrate that the

of TsT transformations. On the field theory side, we identify the dual field
theory which also depends on two parameters. We find a point-like string
solution and derive its dispersion relation. A non-trivial test of the
correspondence is provided by using the Landau-Lifshitz coherent state approach
to reproduce the leading, in the deformation parameters, terms of that
relation. Then, we calculate the Wilson loop, describing the quark/anti-quark
potential at strong coupling. It exhibits confining behaviour when the
separation length is much less than the Schr\""{o}dinger parameter. When the
separation length is much greater than the Schr\""{o}dinger parameter the

information on their magnetospheres. In this study we attempt a theoretical
modelling of the coupling of black holes with their jets and discs, via three
innovations. First, we propose a semi-analytical MHD description of a steady
relativistic inflow-outflow structure characteristic to the extraction of the
hole rotational energy. The mass-loading is ensured in a thin layer, the
stagnation surface, by a two-photon pair production originating to a gamma-ray
emission from the surrounding disc. The double flow is described near the polar
axis by an axisymmetric meridionally self-similar MHD model. Second, the inflow
and outflow solutions are crossing the MHD critical points and are matched at
the stagnation surface. Knowledge of the MHD field on the horizon give us the
angular momentum and energy extracted from the black hole. Finally, we
illustrate the model with three specific examples of double-flow solutions by
varying the energetic interaction between the MHD field and the rotating black
hole. When the isorotation frequency is half of the black hole one, the
extracted Poynting flux is comparable to the one obtained using the force-free
assumption. In two of the presented solutions, the Penrose process dominates at
large colatitudes, while the third is Poynting flux dominated at mid
colatitudes. Mass injection rate estimations, from disk luminosity and inner
radius, give an upper limit just above the values obtained for two solutions.
This model is pertinent to describe the flows near the polar axis where pair
production is more efficient.

electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. For physiological time series, deep learning
(DL) superiority to feature engineering (FE) approaches based on domain
knowledge is still an open question. Moreover, it remains unclear whether
combining DL with FE may improve performance. Methods: We considered three
tasks intending to address these research gaps: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis
(multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction
(binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall
dataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each
task: i) a random forest taking the FE as input was trained as a classical
machine learning approach; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged model
of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating
significantly less data for the two classification tasks and it was
outperformed by DL for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL
did not improve performance over DL alone. Conclusion: We found that for
traditional 12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks DL did not yield a meaningful
improvement over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional
regression task. We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over
DL alone which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by
DL. Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on what
machine learning strategy and data regime to chose with respect to the task at

observed the planet Neptune. At that time, according to these authors, Galileo
was able to measure angular separations with an accuracy of about 10 seconds of
arc. However, as noticed by Kowal and Drake, the position of Neptune reported
by Galileo is wrong with respect to the position computed with the modern
ephemeris of about 1 minute of arc. This led Kowal and Drake to speculate on
the possible errors of modern ephemeris of Neptune and sparked some debate
about Neptune's ephemeris and/or possible errors in Galileo's measures. Until
today this anomaly has remained without a conclusive answer. Here we show that,
in addition to the random errors, there are other significant measurement
errors present in Galileo's observations. These errors may help clarify the
origin of the alleged anomalies in the position of Neptune.

problems based on autoregressive with exogenous terms (ARX) input-output
models. The solution algorithm relies on a coordinate-descent augmented
Lagrangian (CDAL) method previously proposed by the authors, which we adapt
here to exploit the special structure of ARX-based MPC. The CDAL-ARX algorithm
enjoys the construction-free feature, in that it avoids explicitly constructing
the quadratic programming (QP) problem associated with MPC, which would
eliminate construction cost when the ARX model changes/adapts online. For
example, the ARX model parameters are dependent on linear parameter-varying
(LPV) scheduling signals, or recursively adapted from streaming input-output
data with cheap computation cost, which make the ARX model widely used in
adaptive control. Moreover, the implementation of the resulting CDAL-ARX
algorithm is matrix-free and library-free, and hence amenable for deployment in
industrial embedded platforms. We show the efficiency of CDAL-ARX in two
numerical examples, also in comparison with MPC implementations based on other
general-purpose quadratic programming solvers.

Thus, the model has difficulties in learning the attention globally over

whole-body motion, long-range temporal dynamics, and person-to-person

body motions and local joint motions pay attention to each other. In addition,
we propose a novel pretraining strategy, multi-interval pose displacement
prediction, to learn both global and local attention in diverse time ranges.
The proposed model successfully learns local dynamics of the joints and
captures global context from the motion sequences. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art models by notable margins in the representative benchmarks.

performance degradation of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on such

makes detection of label errors via uncertainty quantification a complex task.
Uncertainty is particularly pronounced at the transitions between connected

the level of predicted components, we enable the usage of DNNs together with
component-level uncertainty quantification for the detection of label errors.
We present a principled approach to benchmarking the task of label error

the labels under control. Our experiments show that our approach is able to
detect the vast majority of label errors while controlling the number of false

is often used to infer the correlation/dependence structure among random
variables, when the population mean and covariance are unknown. A natural block
extension of it, {\it sample block correlation matrix}, is proposed to take on
the same role, when random variables are generalized to random sub-vectors. In
this paper, we establish a spectral theory of the sample block correlation
matrices and apply it to group independent test and related problem, under the
high-dimensional setting. More specifically, we consider a random vector of
dimension $p$, consisting of $k$ sub-vectors of dimension $p_t$'s, where
$p_t$'s can vary from $1$ to order $p$. Our primary goal is to investigate the
dependence of the $k$ sub-vectors. We construct a random matrix model called
sample block correlation matrix based on $n$ samples for this purpose. The
spectral statistics of the sample block correlation matrix include the
classical Wilks' statistic and Schott's statistic as special cases. It turns
out that the spectral statistics do not depend on the unknown population mean
and covariance. Further, under the null hypothesis that the sub-vectors are
independent, the limiting behavior of the spectral statistics can be described
with the aid of the Free Probability Theory. Specifically, under three
different settings of possibly $n$-dependent $k$ and $p_t$'s, we show that the
empirical spectral distribution of the sample block correlation matrix
converges to the free Poisson binomial distribution, free Poisson distribution
(Marchenko-Pastur law) and free Gaussian distribution (semicircle law),
respectively. We then further derive the CLTs for the linear spectral
statistics of the block correlation matrix under general setting.

is one such metric that measures the equilibrium response to CO2 doubling.
However, both in their estimation and their usage, such metrics make
assumptions on the linearity of climate response, although it is known that,
especially for larger forcing levels, response can be nonlinear. Such nonlinear
responses may become visible immediately in response to a larger perturbation,
or may only become apparent after a long transient. In this paper, we
illustrate some potential problems and caveats when estimating ECS from
transient simulations. We highlight ways that very slow timescales may lead to
poor estimation of ECS even if there is seemingly good fit to linear response
over moderate timescales. Moreover, such slow timescale might lead to late
abrupt responses (""late tipping points"") associated with a system's
nonlinearities. We illustrate these ideas using simulations on a global energy
balance model with dynamic albedo. We also discuss the implications for
estimating ECS for global climate models, highlighting that it is likely to
remain difficult to make definitive statements about the simulation times

such sources outside the laboratory, for example, satellite-based applications,
demands a stringent mass and power budget, thus enhancing the mission
complexity and cost. We report a bright, stable entangled photon source with a
relaxed requirement of crystal temperature and laser wavelength stabilization.
Using a periodically poled KTP crystal inside a polarization Sagnac
interferometer producing degenerate, type-0 phase-matched entangled photon
pairs at 810 nm in an annular ring, we have transformed the SPDC ring into a

Despite the variation of the SPDC ring size from Gaussian to annular of
different diameters due to the change of crystal temperature over $7^{o}$C, and
laser wavelength over 300 GHz, we observe the size of the ""perfect"" ring to be

collective decision making, given the probability of sources to provide
accurate information (trustworthiness). However, in reality, the
trustworthiness is not a known quantity to the decision maker - they have to
rely on an estimate called trust. A (machine learning) algorithm that computes
trust is called unbiased when it has the property that it does not
systematically overestimate or underestimate the trustworthiness. To formally
analyse the uncertainty to the decision process, we introduce and analyse two
important properties of such unbiased trust values: stability of correctness
and stability of optimality. Stability of correctness means that the decision
accuracy that the decision maker believes they achieved is equal to the actual
accuracy. We prove stability of correctness holds. Stability of optimality
means that the decisions made based on trust, are equally good as they would
have been if they were based on trustworthiness. Stability of optimality does
not hold. We analyse the difference between the two, and bounds thereon. We
also present an overview of how sensitive decision correctness is to changes in
trust and trustworthiness.

single-dish observations of the ground state rotational transitions of the
$^{13}$C and $^{15}$N isotopologues of HCN, HNC and CN with the IRAM 30m

different offsets across L1544. The $^{15}$N-fractionation map of HCN shows a
clear decrease of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio towards the southern edge of
L1544, where carbon chain molecules present a peak, strongly suggesting that
isotope-selective photodissociation has a strong effect on the fractionation of
nitrogen across pre-stellar cores. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in CN measured
towards four positions across the core also shows a decrease towards the
South-East of the core, while HNC shows opposite behaviour. The uneven
illumination of the pre-stellar core L1544 provides clear evidence that
$^{15}$N-fractionation of HCN and CN is enhanced toward the region more exposed
to the interstellar radiation field. Isotope-selective photodissociation of
N$_2$ is then a crucial process to understand $^{15}$N fractionation, as
already found in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, the $^{15}$N-fractionation in
pre-stellar material is expected to change depending on the environment within
which pre-stellar cores are embedded. The $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN ratio also varies
across the core, but its variation does not affect our conclusions on the

the quadratic memory cost, or fixing the number of correspondences to achieve
linear complexity, which lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
sparse attention based Transformer model, termed Dynamic Sparse Transformer

Specifically, DynaST leverages the multi-layer nature of Transformer structure,
and performs the dynamic attention scheme in a cascaded manner to refine
matching results and synthesize visually-pleasing outputs. In addition, we
introduce a unified training objective for DynaST, making it a versatile
reference-based image translation framework for both supervised and

This value depends on the solution concept being considered.
  We analyze an extensive class of Fisher-type reaction-diffusion equations

the standard elliptical conditions, but without other types of singularities.
  We show that the range of speeds at which classic traveling waves move is an
interval unbounded to the right. Contrary to classic examples, the infimum may
not be reached. When the flow is elliptic or over-elliptic, the minimum speed
of propagation is achieved.
  The classic traveling wave speed threshold is complemented by another value
by analyzing an extension of the first order boundary value problem to which
the classic case is reduced. This singular minimum speed can be justified as a
viscous limit of classic minimal speeds in elliptic or over-elliptic flows.
  We construct a singular profile for each speed between the minimum singular
speed and the speeds at which classic traveling waves move. Under additional
assumptions, the constructed profile can be justified as that of a traveling
wave of the starting equation in the framework of bounded variation functions.
  We also show that saturated fronts verifying the Rankine-Hugoniot condition
can appear for strictly lower speeds even in the framework of bounded variation

recovering the true latents, the method's performance was so far only

Kitaev insulators, QSL is achieved from the zero-field antiferromagnetic state
by the application of magnetic field, suppressing other exchange interactions
responsible for magnetic order. Here, we show that the features attributable to
long-range magnetic ordering of the intermetallic compound, Tb5Si3 (T_N= 69 K),
containing honey-comb network of Tb ions, are completely suppressed by a
critical applied field, H_cr, in heat-capacity and magnetization data,
mimicking the behavior of Kitaev physics candidates. The neutron diffraction
patterns as a function of H reveal that it is an incommensurate magnetic
structure that gets suppressed, showing peaks arising from multiple wave
vectors beyond Hcr. Increasing magnetic entropy as a function of H with a peak
in the magnetically ordered state is in support of some kind of magnetic
disorder in a narrow field range after H_cr. Such a high-field behavior for a
metallic heavy rare-earth system to our knowledge has not been reported in the
past and therefore is intriguing.

autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, the traditional method of
using a single sensor is inevitably limited by the performance of the sensor.
Therefore, a precision and robust method for fusing the LiDAR and stereo
cameras is proposed. This method fully combines the advantages of the LiDAR and
stereo camera, which can retain the advantages of the high precision of the
LiDAR and the high resolution of images respectively. Compared with the
traditional stereo matching method, the texture of the object and lighting
conditions have less influence on the algorithm. Firstly, the depth of the
LiDAR data is converted to the disparity of the stereo camera. Because the
density of the LiDAR data is relatively sparse on the y-axis, the converted
disparity map is up-sampled using the interpolation method. Secondly, in order
to make full use of the precise disparity map, the disparity map and stereo
matching are fused to propagate the accurate disparity. Finally, the disparity
map is converted to the depth map. Moreover, the converted disparity map can
also increase the speed of the algorithm. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on
the KITTI benchmark. The experiment demonstrates that our algorithm has higher
accuracy than several classic methods.

take place homogeneously on the whole system. Indeed, there exist spins having
the same effective local field in all local ground states, exactly as in the
replica symmetric (RS) phase, while the spontaneous RSB manifests only on the
remaining spins, whose fraction vanishes at criticality. The characterization
in terms of spins having fixed or fluctuating local fields can be extended also

fields acting on the spins in the RSB phase with the correlation functions
measured in the paramagnetic phase. Identifying the two types of spins on given
instances of SG and RFIM, we show that they participate very differently to
avalanches produced by flipping a single spin. From the scaling of the number

galaxies may improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to Lyman
Continuum photons leakage from galaxies. Primitive galaxies with low metal and
dust content have been shown to host a more patchy and porous ISM than their
high-metallicity counterparts. To what extent this peculiar structure
contributes to the leakage of ionizing photons remains to be quantitatively
studied. To address these questions we build a refined grid of models including
density-bounded regions and a possible contribution of an X-ray source. Using
MULTIGRIS, a new Bayesian code based on Monte Carlo sampling, we combine the
models as sectors under various assumptions to extract the probability density
distributions of the parameters and infer the corresponding escape fractions
from H II regions (fesc,HII). We apply this new code to a sample of 39
well-know local starbursting dwarf galaxies from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We
confirm previous results hinting at an increased porosity to ionizing photons
of the ISM in low-metallicity galaxies and provide, for the first time,
quantitative predictions for fesc,HII. The predicted fesc,HII for
low-metallicity objects span a large range of values, up to 60%, while the
values derived for more metal-rich galaxies are globally lower. We also examine
the influence of other parameters on the escape fractions, and find that the
specific star-formation rate correlates best with fesc,HII . Finally, we
provide observational line ratios which could be used as tracers of the photons
escaping from density-bounded regions. Although this multi-sector modelling
remains too simple to fully capture the ISM complexity, it can be used to
preselect galaxy samples with potential leakage of ionizing photons based on
current and up-coming spectral data in unresolved surveys of local and
high-redshift galaxies.

differences and frames by treating them as a pair of views and similarly obtain
the shared representations between frame differences and optical flow. The

adoption of deep learning in safety-critical applications. Despite significant
efforts, both practical and theoretical, training deep learning models robust
to adversarial attacks is still an open problem. In this paper, we analyse the
geometry of adversarial attacks in the large-data, overparameterized limit for
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We show that, in the limit, vulnerability to
gradient-based attacks arises as a result of degeneracy in the data
distribution, i.e., when the data lies on a lower-dimensional submanifold of
the ambient space. As a direct consequence, we demonstrate that in this limit
BNN posteriors are robust to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Crucially, we
prove that the expected gradient of the loss with respect to the BNN posterior
distribution is vanishing, even when each neural network sampled from the
posterior is vulnerable to gradient-based attacks. Experimental results on the
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and half moons datasets, representing the finite data
regime, with BNNs trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Variational
Inference, support this line of arguments, showing that BNNs can display both
high accuracy on clean data and robustness to both gradient-based and

space-time lattice. We propose a qualitative theory describing the vanishing
regularization (inviscid) limit as an attractor of the renormalization group
operator acting in the space of flow maps or respective probability kernels. If
the attractor is a nontrivial probability kernel, we say that the inviscid
limit is spontaneously stochastic: it defines a stochastic (Markov) process
solving deterministic equations with deterministic initial and boundary
conditions. The results are illustrated with solvable models: symbolic systems
leading to digital turbulence and systems of expanding interacting phases.

broadband structure in acoustic signals. In this paper, the continuous
(gridless) DOA estimation problem with multiple frequencies is considered. This
problem is formulated as an atomic norm minimization (ANM) problem. The ANM
problem is equivalent to a semi-definite program (SDP) which can be solved by
an off-the-shelf SDP solver. The dual certificate condition is provided to
certify the optimality of the SDP solution so that the sources can be localized
by finding the roots of a polynomial. We also construct the dual polynomial to
satisfy the dual certificate condition and show that such a construction exists
when the source amplitude has a uniform magnitude. In multi-frequency ANM,
spatial aliasing of DOAs at higher frequencies can cause challenges. We discuss
this issue extensively and propose a robust solution to combat aliasing.
Numerical results support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

in randomly layered media with fast variations and long-range correlations. The
analysis takes place in the 3D physical space and weak-coupling regime. The
role played by the slow decay of the correlations on a propagating pulse is two
fold. First we observe a random travel time characterized by a fractional
Brownian motion that appears to have a standard deviation larger than the pulse
width, which is in contrast with the standard O'Doherty-Anstey theory for
random propagation media with mixing properties. Second, a deterministic pulse
deformation is described as the solution of a paraxial wave equation involving
a pseudo-differential operator. This operator is characterized by the
autocorrelation function of the medium fluctuations. In case of fluctuations
with long-range correlations this operator is close to a fractional Weyl
derivative whose order, between 1 and 2, depends on the power decay of the
autocorrelation function. In the frequency domain, the pseudo-differential
operator exhibits a frequency-dependent power law attenuation with exponent
corresponding to the order of the fractional derivative, and a
frequency-dependent phase modulation, both ensuring the causality of the
limiting paraxial wave equation as well as the Kramers-Kronig relations. The
mathematical analysis is based on an approximation-diffusion theorem for random
ordinary differential equation with long-range correlations.

restrictions affecting the performance. To integrate their advantages, we
design the SMoG method. SMoG follows the framework of contrastive learning but
replaces the contrastive unit from instance to group, mimicking
clustering-based methods. To achieve this, we propose the momentum grouping
scheme which synchronously conducts feature grouping with representation
learning. In this way, SMoG solves the problem of supervisory signal hysteresis
which the clustering-based method usually faces, and reduces the false
negatives of instance contrastive methods. We conduct exhaustive experiments to
show that SMoG works well on both CNN and Transformer backbones. Results prove
that SMoG has surpassed the current SOTA unsupervised representation learning

obtained by vanilla supervised learning and the representation can be well

calibration error tolerance of the arrays, under some assumptions about the
nature of the systematic components, is optimally found to be $\sim 0.01\%$ for
the detection of the signal. For position errors, an offset of $\gtrapprox
5\arcsec$ makes the residual foregrounds obscure the target signal. These

galaxies, high-z main sequence starforming, and high-z starburst galaxies are
treated as turbulent clumpy accretion disks. The magnetic field strength is
determined by the equipartition between the turbulent kinetic and the magnetic
energy densities. Our fiducial model, which neither includes galactic winds nor
CR electron secondaries, reproduces the observed radio continuum SEDs of most
(~70%) of the galaxies. Except for the local spiral galaxies, fast galactic
winds can potentially make the conflicting models agree with observations. The
observed IR - radio correlations are reproduced by the model within 2 sigma of
the joint uncertainty of model and data for all datasets. The model agrees with
the observed SFR - radio correlations within ~4 sigma. Energy equipartition
between the CR particles and the magnetic field only approximately holds in our
models of main sequence starforming galaxies. If a CR electron calorimeter is
assumed, the slope of the IR - radio correlation flattens significantly.
Inverse Compton (IC) losses are not dominant in the starburst galaxies because
in these galaxies not only the gas density but also the turbulent velocity
dispersion is higher than in normally starforming galaxies. Equipartition
between the turbulent kinetic and magnetic field energy densities then leads to
very high magnetic field strengths and very short synchrotron timescales. The
exponents of our model SFR - radio correlations at 150 MHz and 1.4 GHz are very
close to one.

aggregate the multiple instances along the coronary centerline into the final
quality. However, not all instances are informative for final quality. There
are some quality-irrelevant/negative instances intervening the exact quality

from the hydrodynamic profiles using (time and space dependent) effective
""gray"" (frequency independent) opacity, based on opacity tables that we have
constructed for this purpose (and will be made publicly available) including
the contributions of bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In an accompanying
paper (Paper II) we show, using a large set of multi-group photon diffusion
calculations, that the spectral energy distribution is well described by a
Planck spectrum with $T=T_{\rm col}$, except at UV frequencies (beyond the
spectral peak at $3T_{\rm col}$), where the flux is significantly suppressed
due to the presence of strong line absorption. We defer the full discussion of
the multi-group results to paper II, but provide here for completeness an
analytic description also of the UV suppression. Our analytic results are a
useful tool for inferring progenitor properties, explosion velocity, and also
relative extinction based on early multi-band shock cooling observations of
supernovae.

To validate this idea, we conduct extensive experiments on the public DAIC-WOZ

taking gender-specific biases into account. The proposed model yields effective
results with 0.89 precision and 0.70 F1-score in detecting major depression and

  In this work, we designed a tool called SLAM to address the issue. SLAM uses
distributed tracing to detect the relationship among the FaaS functions within

Saito-Kurokawa type, we prove an improved bound in the $k$-aspect for the

that there are infinitely many sign changes among the Hecke eigenvalues of $F$

characterized as a class of Lie-admissible algebras whose negative left
multiplication operators make representations of the commutator Lie algebras.
We observe that there is a clear analogy between anti-pre-Lie algebras and

is unexpected that a subclass of anti-pre-Lie algebras, namely admissible
Novikov algebras, correspond to Novikov algebras in terms of $q$-algebras.
Consequently, there is a construction of admissible Novikov algebras from
commutative associative algebras with derivations or more generally, admissible
pairs. The correspondence extends to the level of Poisson type structures,
leading to the introduction of the notions of anti-pre-Lie Poisson algebras and
admissible Novikov-Poisson algebras, whereas the latter correspond to

exploration of ultrametricity and temperature chaos (maybe the most exotic
features in glassy free-energy landscapes). Unfortunately, despite more than
twenty years of theoretical efforts following the experimental discovery of
memory and rejuvenation, these effects have thus far been impossible to
simulate reliably. Yet, three recent developments convinced us to accept this
challenge: first, the custom-built Janus II supercomputer makes it possible to
carry out ""numerical experiments"" in which the very same quantities that can be
measured in single crystals of CuMn are computed from the simulation, allowing
for parallel analysis of the simulation/experiment data. Second, Janus II
simulations have taught us how numerical and experimental length scales should
be compared. Third, we have recently understood how temperature chaos
materializes in aging dynamics. All three aspects have proved crucial for
reliably reproducing rejuvenation and memory effects on the computer. Our
analysis shows that (at least) three different length scales play a key role in
aging dynamics, while essentially all theoretical analyses of the aging
dynamics emphasize the presence and the crucial role of a single glassy
correlation length.

enable complete coverage of the environment to a specified resolution, yet in
many cases sampling at the resolution of the distribution would yield long

result in feasible plans at the expense of distribution estimation accuracy.
This work explores this tradeoff between distribution accuracy and path length

performance by computing metrics for accuracy and path length in a Monte-Carlo

in their predictions, leading to poor calibration. The most common post-hoc
approach to compensate for this is to perform temperature scaling, which
adjusts the confidences of the predictions on any input by scaling the logits
by a fixed value. Whilst this approach typically improves the average
calibration across the whole test dataset, this improvement typically reduces
the individual confidences of the predictions irrespective of whether the
classification of a given input is correct or incorrect. With this insight, we
base our method on the observation that different samples contribute to the
calibration error by varying amounts, with some needing to increase their
confidence and others needing to decrease it. Therefore, for each input, we
propose to predict a different temperature value, allowing us to adjust the
mismatch between confidence and accuracy at a finer granularity. Furthermore,
we observe improved results on OOD detection and can also extract a notion of
hardness for the data-points. Our method is applied post-hoc, consequently
using very little computation time and with a negligible memory footprint and
is applied to off-the-shelf pre-trained classifiers. We test our method on the
ResNet50 and WideResNet28-10 architectures using the CIFAR10/100 and

beneficial also for the expected calibration error across the whole test set.

centrality score of the target of the arc; rank monotonicity means that adding
an arc improves the importance of the target of the arc relatively to the
remaining nodes. It is known that most centralities are both score and rank
monotone on directed, strongly connected graphs. In this paper, we study the
problem of score and rank monotonicity for classical centrality measures in the
case of undirected networks: in this case, we require that score, or relative
importance, improve at both endpoints of the new edge. We show that,
surprisingly, the situation in the undirected case is very different, and in
particular that closeness, harmonic centrality, betweenness, eigenvector
centrality, Seeley's index, Katz's index, and PageRank are not rank monotone;
betweenness and PageRank are not even score monotone. In other words, while it

cybersecurity challenges has gained traction in industry and academia,
partially as a result of widespread malware attacks on critical systems such as
cloud infrastructures and government institutions. Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS), using some forms of AI, have received widespread adoption due to their
ability to handle vast amounts of data with a high prediction accuracy. These
systems are hosted in the organizational Cyber Security Operation Center (CSoC)
as a defense tool to monitor and detect malicious network flow that would
otherwise impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). CSoC
analysts rely on these systems to make decisions about the detected threats.
However, IDSs designed using Deep Learning (DL) techniques are often treated as
black box models and do not provide a justification for their predictions. This
creates a barrier for CSoC analysts, as they are unable to improve their
decisions based on the model's predictions. One solution to this problem is to
design explainable IDS (X-IDS).
  This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (XAI) for IDS, its
current challenges, and discusses how these challenges span to the design of an
X-IDS. In particular, we discuss black box and white box approaches
comprehensively. We also present the tradeoff between these approaches in terms
of their performance and ability to produce explanations. Furthermore, we
propose a generic architecture that considers human-in-the-loop which can be
used as a guideline when designing an X-IDS. Research recommendations are given
from three critical viewpoints: the need to define explainability for IDS, the
need to create explanations tailored to various stakeholders, and the need to
design metrics to evaluate explanations.

unfortunately omits important kinetic physics which have been shown to play a

and clocks must eventually indicate the same value. Previous algorithms worked
in static networks with drastic connectivity properties and assumed that global
information is available at each agent. In this paper, we propose different
solutions for time-varying topologies that require neither strong connectivity
nor any global knowledge on the network.
  First, we study the case of unbounded clocks, and propose a self-stabilizing
$MinMax$ algorithm that works if, in each sufficiently long but bounded period
of time, there is an agent, called a root, that can send messages, possibly
indirectly, to all other agents. Such networks are highly dynamic in the sense
that roots may change arbitrarily over time. Moreover, the bound on the time
required for achieving this rootedness property is unknown to the agents. Then
we present a finite-state algorithm that synchronizes periodic clocks in
dynamic networks that are strongly connected over bounded period of time. Here
also, the bound on the time for achieving strong connectivity exists, but is
not supposed to be known. Interestingly, our algorithm unifies several
seemingly different algorithms proposed previously for static networks. Next,
we show that strong connectivity is actually not required: our algorithm still
works when the network is just rooted over bounded period of time with a set of
roots that becomes stable. Finally, we study the time and space complexities of
our algorithms, and discuss how initial timing information allows for more

relevant algorithmic procedure with many applications in science and industry.
Roughly speaking, ANNs can be regarded as iterated compositions between affine
linear functions and certain fixed nonlinear functions, which are usually
multidimensional versions of a one-dimensional so-called activation function.
The most popular choice of such a one-dimensional activation function is the
rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function which maps a real number to
its positive part $ \mathbb{R} \ni x \mapsto \max\{ x, 0 \} \in \mathbb{R} $.
In this article we propose and analyze a modified variant of the standard
training procedure of such ReLU ANNs in the sense that we propose to restrict
the negative gradient flow dynamics to a large submanifold of the ANN parameter
space, which is a strict $ C^{ \infty } $-submanifold of the entire ANN
parameter space that seems to enjoy better regularity properties than the
entire ANN parameter space but which is also sufficiently large and
sufficiently high dimensional so that it can represent all ANN realization
functions that can be represented through the entire ANN parameter space. In
the special situation of shallow ANNs with just one-dimensional ANN layers we
also prove for every Lipschitz continuous target function that every gradient
flow trajectory on this large submanifold of the ANN parameter space is
globally bounded. For the standard gradient flow on the entire ANN parameter
space with Lipschitz continuous target functions it remains an open problem of
research to prove or disprove the global boundedness of gradient flow
trajectories even in the situation of shallow ANNs with just one-dimensional

question-driven ensemble (QDE) modeling approach to address both goals. We
first describe flexible ETAS models in which we relax the assumptions of
parametrically defined aftershock productivity and background earthquake rates
during model calibration. Instead, both productivity and background rates are
calibrated with data such that their variability is optimally represented by
the model. Then we consider 64 QDE models in pseudo-prospective forecasting
experiments for Southern California and Italy. QDE models are constructed by
combining model parameters of different ingredient models, where the rules for
how to combine parameters are defined by questions about the future seismicity.
The QDE models can be interpreted as models which address different questions
with different ingredient models. We find that certain models best address the
same issues in both regions, and that QDE models can substantially outperform
the standard ETAS and all ingredient models. The best performing QDE model is
obtained through the combination of models allowing flexible background
seismicity and flexible aftershock productivity, respectively, where the former
parameterizes the spatial distribution of background earthquakes and the
partitioning of seismicity into background events and aftershocks, and the
latter is used to parameterize the spatio-temporal occurrence of aftershocks.

desired content in the edited region. A recent work borrows SPADE block to
achieve semantic image editing. However, it cannot produce pleasing results due
to style discrepancy between the edited region and surrounding pixels. We
attribute this to the fact that SPADE only uses an image-independent local
semantic layout but ignores the image-specific styles included in the known
pixels. To address this issue, we propose a style-preserved modulation (SPM)
comprising two modulations processes: The first modulation incorporates the
contextual style and semantic layout, and then generates two fused modulation
parameters. The second modulation employs the fused parameters to modulate
feature maps. By using such two modulations, SPM can inject the given semantic
layout while preserving the image-specific context style. Moreover, we design a
progressive architecture for generating the edited content in a coarse-to-fine
manner. The proposed method can obtain context-consistent results and
significantly alleviate the unpleasant boundary between the generated regions

deformed images are used to assess radiances, to measure optical fluxes from

quite surprisingly, existing methods generally disregard them. The paper's main
contribution is to put forward a simple, methodical, and practical method that
can effectively exploit such organic priors to solve NRSfM. The proposed method
does not make assumptions other than the popular one on the low-rank shape and
offers a reliable solution to NRSfM under orthographic projection. Our work
reveals that the accessibility of organic priors is independent of the camera
motion and shape deformation type. Besides that, the paper provides insights
into the NRSfM factorization -- both in terms of shape and motion -- and is the
first approach to show the benefit of single rotation averaging for NRSfM.
Furthermore, we outline how to effectively recover motion and non-rigid 3D

that outperform prior-free NRSfM performance by a significant margin. Finally,
we present the benefits of our method via extensive experiments and evaluations

long-standing challenges in deep neural networks (DNNs) as they are prone to
catastrophic forgetting. CL models can benefit from self-supervised
pre-training as it enables learning more generalizable task-agnostic features.
However, the effect of self-supervised pre-training diminishes as the length of
task sequences increases. Furthermore, the domain shift between pre-training
data distribution and the task distribution reduces the generalizability of the
learned representations. To address these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic
Representation Consolidation (TARC), a two-stage training paradigm for CL that
intertwines task-agnostic and task-specific learning whereby self-supervised
training is followed by supervised learning for each task. To further restrict
the deviation from the learned representations in the self-supervised stage, we
employ a task-agnostic auxiliary loss during the supervised stage. We show that
our training paradigm can be easily added to memory- or regularization-based
approaches and provides consistent performance gain across more challenging CL
settings. We further show that it leads to more robust and well-calibrated
models.

Bjorken $x$, we study the production of a pair of relatively hard jets via
coherent diffraction. By ""relatively hard"" we mean that the transverse momenta
of the two jets -- the quark ($q$) and the antiquark ($\bar{q}$) generated by
the decay of the virtual photon -- are much larger than the target saturation
momentum $Q_s(Y_{\mathbb{P}})$ evaluated at the rapidity gap $Y_{\mathbb{P}}$.
We argue that the typical final-state configurations are such that the hard
$q\bar q$ dijets are accompanied by a semi-hard gluon jet, with a transverse
momentum of the order of $Q_s(Y_{\mathbb{P}})$. The presence of this third jet
ensures that the scattering is strong and thus avoids the strong suppression of
exclusive (hard) dijet production due to colour transparency. For such ""2+1""
jet configurations, we demonstrate that both the emission of the semi-hard
gluon and its scattering with the hadronic target can be factorised in terms of
an effective gluon-gluon dipole. This effective description, originally
proposed in [1-4], builds a bridge between the colour dipole picture and
collinear factorisation: the cross-section for diffractive 2+1 jets can be
written as the product between a hard factor describing the $q\bar{q}$ dijets
and a semi-hard factor expressing the unintegrated gluon distribution of the
Pomeron. The latter is controlled by gluon dipole scattering in the black disk
limit and hence is strongly sensitive to gluon saturation. By integrating out
the kinematics of the 3 jets, we obtain the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to the
diffractive structure function in collinearly-factorised form.

hindsight to infer counterfactual consequences that can accelerate policy
improvements. We compare HL against classic baselines in the multi-secretary

business-critical cloud resource management problem -- allocating Virtual
Machines (VMs) to physical machines, and simulate their performance with real
datasets from a large public cloud provider. We find that HL algorithms
outperform domain-specific heuristics, as well as state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods.

  Interactions","KDD'22 Workshop on Machine Learning in Finance",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become ubiquitous in a
multitude of high-stakes decision-making applications. The unparalleled ability
of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from data also enables them to
incorporate biases embedded within. A biased model can then make decisions that
disproportionately harm certain groups in society -- limiting their access to
financial services, for example. The awareness of this problem has given rise
to the field of Fair ML, which focuses on studying, measuring, and mitigating
unfairness in algorithmic prediction, with respect to a set of protected groups
(e.g., race or gender). However, the underlying causes for algorithmic
unfairness still remain elusive, with researchers divided between blaming
either the ML algorithms or the data they are trained on. In this work, we
maintain that algorithmic unfairness stems from interactions between models and
biases in the data, rather than from isolated contributions of either of them.
To this end, we propose a taxonomy to characterize data bias and we study a set
of hypotheses regarding the fairness-accuracy trade-offs that fairness-blind ML
algorithms exhibit under different data bias settings. On our real-world
account-opening fraud use case, we find that each setting entails specific
trade-offs, affecting fairness in expected value and variance -- the latter
often going unnoticed. Moreover, we show how algorithms compare differently in
terms of accuracy and fairness, depending on the biases affecting the data.
Finally, we note that under specific data bias conditions, simple
pre-processing interventions can successfully balance group-wise error rates,
while the same techniques fail in more complex settings.

recommend treatments to individuals based on their characteristics. Though
ubiquitous in medicine, ITRs are hardly ever evaluated in randomized controlled
trials. To evaluate ITRs from observational data, we introduce a new
probabilistic model and distinguish two situations: i) the situation of a newly
developed ITR, where data are from a population where no patient implements the
ITR, and ii) the situation of a partially implemented ITR, where data are from
a population where the ITR is implemented in some unidentified patients. In the
former situation, we propose a procedure to explore the impact of an ITR under
various implementation schemes. In the latter situation, on top of the
fundamental problem of causal inference, we need to handle an additional latent
variable denoting implementation. To evaluate ITRs in this situation, we
propose an estimation procedure that relies on an expectation-maximization
algorithm. In Monte Carlo simulations our estimators appear unbiased and
consistent while confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage. We illustrate
our approach on the MIMIC-III database, focusing on ITRs for initiation of
renal replacement therapy in patients with acute kidney injury.

scale-invariant model that extends the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model
electroweak sector to SU(3)$_L\otimes$U(1)$_X\otimes$U(1)$_N$, with a built-in
$B-L$ symmetry. The model is based on the symmetry structure of the known 3-3-1
models and, thus, it relates the number of the three observed fermion
generations with the cancellation of gauge anomalies. Symmetry breaking is
triggered via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism taking into account a minimal set
of scalar field multiplets. We establish the stability conditions for the
tree-level scalar potential imposing the copositivity criteria and use the
method of Gildener-Weinberg for computing the one-loop effective potential when
one has multiple scalar fields. With the addition of vectorial fermions,
getting their mass mainly through the vacuum expectation value of scalar
singlets at $10^3$ TeV, the $B-L$ symmetry leads to textures for the fermion
mass matrices, allowing seesaw mechanisms for neutrinos and quarks to take
place. In particular, these mechanisms could partly explain the mass
hierarchies of the quarks. Once the breakdown of the SU(3)$_L$ symmetry is
supposed to occur around 10 TeV, the model also predicts new particles with
TeV-scale masses, such as a neutral scalar, $H_{1}$, a charged scalar, $H^\pm$,
and the gauge bosons $Z^{\prime}$, $W^{\prime\pm}$ and $Y^0$, that could be
searched with the high-luminosity LHC.

Within this work, we focus on the wavefront and detector geometry dependent TTL

fundamental Gaussian beams. We characterise the coupling originating from the
properties of the interfering beams, i.e. their absolute and relative angle at

Furthermore, we discuss the dependency of the TTL coupling on the geometry of
the detecting photodiode. Wherever possible, we provide analytical expressions

jitter of a mirror or a receiving system. These effects are directly compared

applications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence
(AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain
specific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for
quantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical
challenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data
for better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the
input space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized
counterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of
paramount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based

log-law indicator function, which is nearly indistinguishable between the pipe
and channel flows up to $y^+=250$, has not yet developed a plateau further away
from the wall in the pipes even for the $Re_\tau=5200$ cases. The wall shear
stress fluctuations and the inner peak of the axial velocity intensity -- which
grow monotonically with $Re_\tau$ -- are lower in the pipe than in the channel,
but the difference decreases with increasing $Re_\tau$. While the wall values
are slightly lower in channel than pipe flows at the same $Re_\tau$, the inner
peaks of the pressure fluctuations show negligible differences between them.
The Reynolds number scaling of all these quantities agrees with both the
logarithmic and defect power laws if the coefficients are properly chosen. The
one-dimensional spectrum of the axial velocity fluctuation exhibits a $k^{-1}$
dependence at an intermediate distance from the wall -- as also seen in the
channel flow. In summary, this high-fidelity data enable us to provide better

(associated with expected delays of moderate duration) and travel time
unreliability (associated with unexpected delays of longer duration), the
contribution of this paper is to derive and quantify the value of travel time
unreliability. Extensive empirical studies show that the long tail of the
travel time distribution and corresponding unexpected delay can have much more
serious consequences than expected delay. However, unexpected delay due to
unreliability has received limited attention in previous studies of the value
of travel time variability. Methodologically, we define the summation of all
unexpected delays as the unreliability area of the travel time distribution and
show that this is captured by two existing well defined reliability for
quantifying travel time variability. We then formally derive the value of
unreliability (VOU), show that it is distinct from the more established value
of reliability (VOR), and combine the VOU and VOR in an overall VOV. We prove
theoretically that the VOV exhibits diminishing marginal benefit in terms of
the traveler punctuality requirements under a validity condition, implying that
it may be economically inefficient for travelers to blindly pursue a higher
probability of not being late. We then proceed to develop the concept of the
travel time variability ratio, which gives the implicit cost of the punctuality
requirement imposed on any given trip. Numerical examples reveal that the
travel time unreliability cost can account for more than 10% of the trip cost,
such that its omission could introduce non-trivial bias into route choice
models and transportation appraisal more generally.

Algorithm (QAOA) in recent years have gained popularity as they provide the
hope of using NISQ devices to tackle hard combinatorial optimization problems.
It is, however, known that at low depth, certain locality constraints of QAOA
limit its performance. To go beyond these limitations, a non-local variant of
QAOA, namely recursive QAOA (RQAOA), was proposed to improve the quality of
approximate solutions. The RQAOA has been studied comparatively less than QAOA,
and it is less understood, for instance, for what family of instances it may
fail to provide high quality solutions. However, as we are tackling
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems (specifically, the Ising spin model), it is
expected that RQAOA does fail, raising the question of designing even better
quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization. In this spirit, we identify
and analyze cases where RQAOA fails and, based on this, propose a reinforcement
learning enhanced RQAOA variant (RL-RQAOA) that improves upon RQAOA. We show
that the performance of RL-RQAOA improves over RQAOA: RL-RQAOA is strictly
better on these identified instances where RQAOA underperforms, and is
similarly performing on instances where RQAOA is near-optimal. Our work
exemplifies the potentially beneficial synergy between reinforcement learning
and quantum (inspired) optimization in the design of new, even better
heuristics for hard problems.

based on a SU(2)-symmetrical Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation that couples
auxiliary field to the local electronic density. This decoupling is known to
have a regular saddle-point structure: each saddle point is a set of elementary
field configurations localized in space and imaginary time which we coin
instantons. We formulate a classical partition function for the instanton gas
that has predictive power. Namely, we can predict the distribution of
instantons and show that the instanton number is sharply defined in the
thermodynamic limit, thus defining a unique dominant saddle point. Despite the
fact that the instanton approach does not capture the magnetic transition
inherent to the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, we were able to
describe the local moment formation accompanied by short-ranged
anti-ferromagnetic correlations. This aspect is also seen in the single
particle spectral function that shows clear signs of the upper and lower
Hubbard bands. Our instanton approach bears remarkable similarities to local
dynamical approaches, such as dynamical mean field theory, in the sense that it
has the unique property of allowing for local moment formation without breaking
the SU(2) spin symmetry. In contrast to local approaches, it captures
short-ranged magnetic fluctuations. Furthermore, it also offers possibilities
for systematic improvements by taking into account fluctuations around the
dominant saddle point. Finally, we show that the saddle point structure depends
upon the choice of lattice geometry. For the square lattice at half-filling,
the saddle point structure reflects the itinerant to localized nature of the
magnetism as a function of the coupling strength. The implications of our
results for Lefschetz thimbles approaches to alleviate the sign problem are
also discussed.

In the context of a simple (yet novel) model of V2V hazard information sharing,
we ask whether partial adoption of this technology can similarly lead to
undesirable outcomes. In our model, drivers individually choose how recklessly
to behave as a function of information received from other V2V-enabled cars,
and the resulting aggregate behavior influences the likelihood of accidents
(and thus the information propagated by the vehicular network). We fully
characterize the game-theoretic equilibria of this model using our new
equilibrium concept. Our model indicates that for a wide range of the parameter
space, V2V information sharing surprisingly increases the equilibrium frequency
of accidents relative to no V2V information sharing, and that it may increase
equilibrium social cost as well.

circuits inevitably suffer from performance degradation. Although there has
been plenty of work on automating analog circuit design under the typical
condition, limited research has been done on exploring robust designs under
real and unpredictable silicon variations. Automatic analog design against
variations requires prohibitive computation and time costs. To address the
challenge, we present RobustAnalog, a robust circuit design framework that
involves the variation information in the optimization process. Specifically,
circuit optimizations under different variations are considered as a set of
tasks. Similarities among tasks are leveraged and competitions are alleviated
to realize a sample-efficient multi-task training. Moreover, RobustAnalog
prunes the task space according to the current performance in each iteration,
leading to a further simulation cost reduction. In this way, RobustAnalog can
rapidly produce a set of circuit parameters that satisfies diverse constraints

studies focus on modeling long-term dependencies between visits, without
explicitly taking short-term correlations between consecutive visits into
account, where irregular time intervals, incorporated as auxiliary information,
are fed into health prediction models to capture latent progressive patterns of
patient journeys. We present a novel deep neural network with four modules to
take into account the contributions of various variables for health prediction:
i) the Stacked Attention module strengthens the deep semantics in clinical
events within each patient journey and generates visit embeddings, ii) the
Short-Term Temporal Attention module models short-term correlations between
consecutive visit embeddings while capturing the impact of time intervals
within those visit embeddings, iii) the Long-Term Temporal Attention module
models long-term dependencies between visit embeddings while capturing the
impact of time intervals within those visit embeddings, iv) and finally, the
Coupled Attention module adaptively aggregates the outputs of Short-Term
Temporal Attention and Long-Term Temporal Attention modules to make health
predictions. Experimental results on MIMIC-III demonstrate superior predictive
accuracy of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, as well as
the interpretability and robustness of this approach. Furthermore, we found
that modeling short-term correlations contributes to local priors generation,
leading to improved predictive modeling of patient journeys.

the potential function of the former can serve as a Lyapunov function

Apart for a recognition of the facets by Suck (2002), the geometric structure

  Differentiation by Overloading",,,,,"cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adjoint algorithmic differentiation by operator and function overloading is
based on the interpretation of directed acyclic graphs resulting from
evaluations of numerical simulation programs. The size of the computer system
memory required to store the graph grows proportional to the number of
floating-point operations executed by the underlying program. It quickly
exceeds the available memory resources. Naive adjoint algorithmic
differentiation often becomes infeasible except for relatively simple numerical
simulations.
  Access to the data associated with the graph can be classified as sequential
and random. The latter refers to memory access patterns defined by the
adjacency relationship between vertices within the graph. Sequentially accessed
data can be decomposed into blocks. The blocks can be streamed across the
system memory hierarchy thus extending the amount of available memory, for
example, to hard discs. Asynchronous i/o can help to mitigate the increased
cost due to accesses to slower memory. Much larger problem instances can thus
be solved without resorting to technically challenging user intervention such
as checkpointing. Randomly accessed data should not have to be decomposed. Its
block-wise streaming is likely to yield a substantial overhead in computational
cost due to data accesses across blocks. Consequently, the size of the randomly
accessed memory required by an adjoint should be kept minimal in order to
eliminate the need for decomposition. We propose a combination of dedicated
memory for adjoint $L$-values with the exploitation of remainder bandwidth as a
possible solution. Test results indicate significant savings in random access
memory size while preserving overall computational efficiency.

use of features, also called side information, in their design similar to
algorithms in Machine Learning (ML). In contrast, some of the most popular and
traditional algorithms for RecSys solely focus on a given user-item-rating
relation without including side information. The goal of this case study is to
provide a performance comparison and assessment of RecSys and ML algorithms
when side information is included. We chose the Movielens-100K data set since
it is a standard for comparing RecSys algorithms. We compared six different
feature sets with varying quantities of features which were generated from the
baseline data and evaluated on a total of 19 RecSys algorithms, baseline ML
algorithms, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipelines, and state-of-the-art
RecSys algorithms that incorporate side information. The results show that
additional features benefit all algorithms we evaluated. However, the
correlation between feature quantity and performance is not monotonous for
AutoML and RecSys. In these categories, an analysis of feature importance
revealed that the quality of features matters more than quantity. Throughout
our experiments, the average performance on the feature set with the lowest
number of features is about 6% worse compared to that with the highest in terms
of the Root Mean Squared Error. An interesting observation is that AutoML
outperforms matrix factorization-based RecSys algorithms when additional
features are used. Almost all algorithms that can include side information have
higher performance when using the highest quantity of features. In the other
cases, the performance difference is negligible (<1%). The results show a clear
positive trend for the effect of feature quantity as well as the important
effects of feature quality on the evaluated algorithms.

defining proper priors for the MFA parameters and quantifying the noise in the
collected data. We start to address these issues by first deriving and
implementing an expert elicitation procedure suitable for generating MFA
parameter priors. Second, we propose to learn the data noise concurrent with
the parametric uncertainty. These methods are demonstrated using a case study
on the 2012 U.S. steel flow. Eight experts are interviewed to elicit
distributions on steel flow uncertainty from raw materials to intermediate
goods. The experts' distributions are combined and weighted according to the
expertise demonstrated in response to seeding questions. These aggregated
distributions form our model parameters' prior. A sensible, weakly-informative
prior is also adopted for learning the data noise. Bayesian inference is then
performed to update the parametric and data noise uncertainty given MFA data
collected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the World Steel
Association (WSA). The results show a reduction in MFA parametric uncertainty
when incorporating the collected data. Only a modest reduction in data noise
uncertainty was observed; however, greater reductions were achieved when using
data from multiple years in the inference. These methods generate transparent
MFA and data noise uncertainties learned from data rather than pre-assumed data
noise levels, providing a more robust basis for decision-making that affects
the system.

solar mass primary black hole accompanied by a ~ 150 million solar mass
secondary black hole in an eccentric orbit, which triggers electromagnetic
flares twice in every ~ 12 year orbital period when it traverses the accretion
disk of the primary. The times of these emissions are consistent with the
predictions of general relativity calculated to the 4.5th post-Newtonian order.
The orbit of the secondary black hole samples the gravitational field at
distances between O(10) and O(50) Schwarzschild radii around the primary, and
hence is sensitive to the possible presence of a dark matter spike around it.
We find that the agreement of general-relativistic calculations with the
measured timings of flares from OJ 287 constrains the mass of such a spike to <
3% of the primary mass.

large-scale AI applications to land in the market and practice. However, while
AI technology has brought many conveniences to people in the productization

paper proposes a semantics censorship chatbot system based on reinforcement

censorship model and the semantics purification model. Offensive semantics
review can combine the context of user input sentences to detect the rapid
evolution of Offensive semantics and respond to Offensive semantics responses.
The semantics purification model For the case of chatting robot models, it has
been contaminated by large numbers of offensive semantics, by strengthening the
offensive reply learned by the learning algorithm, rather than rolling back to
the early versions. In addition, by integrating a once-through learning
approach, the speed of semantics purification is accelerated while reducing the
impact on the quality of replies. The experimental results show that our
proposed approach reduces the probability of the chat model generating
offensive replies and that the integration of the few-shot learning algorithm
improves the training speed rapidly while effectively slowing down the decline

(ML), such as classification, natural language processing, and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this research effort, we study the unfairness
of GANs. We formally define a new fairness notion for generative models in
terms of the distribution of generated samples sharing the same protected
attributes (gender, race, etc.). The defined fairness notion (representational
fairness) requires the distribution of the sensitive attributes at the test
time to be uniform, and, in particular for GAN model, we show that this
fairness notion is violated even when the dataset contains equally represented
groups, i.e., the generator favors generating one group of samples over the
others at the test time. In this work, we shed light on the source of this
representation bias in GANs along with a straightforward method to overcome
this problem. We first show on two widely used datasets (MNIST, SVHN) that when
the norm of the gradient of one group is more important than the other during
the discriminator's training, the generator favours sampling data from one
group more than the other at test time. We then show that controlling the
groups' gradient norm by performing group-wise gradient norm clipping in the
discriminator during the training leads to a more fair data generation in terms
of representational fairness compared to existing models while preserving the
quality of generated samples.

issue for several decades and is still being debated. We use the Paliya et al.
sample of 619 $\gamma$-ray-loud flat-spectrum radio quasars with the available
spectral energy distributions, and employ a seed photon factor approach, to
locate the $\gamma$-rays production region. This method efficiently set up a
relation between the peak frequencies and luminosities for the synchrotron
emission and inverse Compton scattering, together with a combination of the
energy density and characteristic energy for the external seed photon field,
namely, $\sqrt{U_0}/\epsilon_0$, an indicative factor of seed photons (SF) in
units of Gauss. By means of comparing it with canonical values of broad-line
region and molecular dusty torus, we principally ascertain that the GeV
emission is originated far beyond the BLR and close to the DT -- farther out at
pc scales from the central black hole, which supports a {\it far-site} scenario
for $\gamma$-ray blazars. We probe the idea that inverse Compton scattering of
infrared seed photons is happening in the Thomson regime. This approach and our
findings are based on the validity of the External Compton model, which is
applicable to understand the GeV emission mechanism in FSRQs. However, the
completeness of this framework has been challenged by reports of neutrino
emission from blazars. Thus we also shed new light on the neutrino production
region by using our derived results since blazars are promising neutrino

attention from the fields of human-machine interactions and cognitive science
in recent years. However, how to recognize emotions with limited labels has
become a new research and application bottleneck. To address the issue, this
paper proposes a Self-supervised Group Meiosis Contrastive learning framework
(SGMC) based on the stimuli consistent EEG signals in human being. In the SGMC,
a novel genetics-inspired data augmentation method, named Meiosis, is
developed. It takes advantage of the alignment of stimuli among the EEG samples
in a group for generating augmented groups by pairing, cross exchanging, and
separating. And the model adopts a group projector to extract group-level
feature representations from group EEG samples triggered by the same emotion
video stimuli. Then contrastive learning is employed to maximize the similarity
of group-level representations of augmented groups with the same stimuli. The
SGMC achieves the state-of-the-art emotion recognition results on the publicly
available DEAP dataset with an accuracy of 94.72% and 95.68% in valence and
arousal dimensions, and also reaches competitive performance on the public SEED
dataset with an accuracy of 94.04%. It is worthy of noting that the SGMC shows
significant performance even when using limited labels. Moreover, the results
of feature visualization suggest that the model might have learned video-level
emotion-related feature representations to improve emotion recognition. And the
effects of group size are further evaluated in the hyper parametric analysis.
Finally, a control experiment and ablation study are carried out to examine the
rationality of architecture. The code is provided publicly online.
