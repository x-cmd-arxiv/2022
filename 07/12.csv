of self-attention mechanism. Many of these works consider decomposing the
self-attention procedure into regional and local feature extraction procedures
that each incurs a much smaller computational complexity. However, regional
information is typically only achieved at the expense of undesirable
information lost owing to down-sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel
Transformer architecture that aims to mitigate the cost issue, named Dual
Vision Transformer (Dual-ViT). The new architecture incorporates a critical
semantic pathway that can more efficiently compress token vectors into global
semantics with reduced order of complexity. Such compressed global semantics
then serve as useful prior information in learning finer pixel level details,
through another constructed pixel pathway. The semantic pathway and pixel
pathway are then integrated together and are jointly trained, spreading the
enhanced self-attention information in parallel through both of the pathways.
Dual-ViT is henceforth able to reduce the computational complexity without
compromising much accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that Dual-ViT provides
superior accuracy than SOTA Transformer architectures with reduced training
complexity. Source code is available at

computer vision tasks, while the self-attention computation in Transformer
scales quadratically w.r.t. the input patch number. Thus, existing solutions
commonly employ down-sampling operations (e.g., average pooling) over
keys/values to dramatically reduce the computational cost. In this work, we
argue that such over-aggressive down-sampling design is not invertible and
inevitably causes information dropping especially for high-frequency components
in objects (e.g., texture details). Motivated by the wavelet theory, we
construct a new Wavelet Vision Transformer (\textbf{Wave-ViT}) that formulates
the invertible down-sampling with wavelet transforms and self-attention
learning in a unified way. This proposal enables self-attention learning with
lossless down-sampling over keys/values, facilitating the pursuing of a better
efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, inverse wavelet transforms are
leveraged to strengthen self-attention outputs by aggregating local contexts
with enlarged receptive field. We validate the superiority of Wave-ViT through
extensive experiments over multiple vision tasks (e.g., image recognition,
object detection and instance segmentation). Its performances surpass
state-of-the-art ViT backbones with comparable FLOPs. Source code is available

different theories of gravity: standard gravity in the $\Lambda$CDM model and
$f(R)$. We extract 49169 dark matter halos in 11 redshift bins in the range
$0\leq z\leq 1$ and in three different mass bins in the range
$0.9<M_{200}/10^{14}h^{-1}$M$_\odot<11$. We investigate the correlation of
$\varsigma$ with the redshift and the mass accretion rate (MAR) of the halos.
We show that $\varsigma$ decreases from $\sim 3R_{200}$ to $\sim 2R_{200}$ when
$z$ increases from 0 to $1$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model; at $z\sim 0.1$,
$\varsigma$ decreases from $2.75R_{200}$ to $\sim 2.5R_{200}$ when the MAR
increases from $\sim 10^4h^{-1}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim 2\times

larger than in $\Lambda$CDM. We detect $\varsigma$ and its correlation with
redshift and MAR in three samples of real clusters. We consider 129 clusters of
galaxies from the Cluster Infall Regions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (CIRS)

$\varsigma$ of real clusters appear consistent with both the $\Lambda$CDM and

  Vision","Accepted on ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised pre-training for 3D vision has drawn increasing research
interest in recent years. In order to learn informative representations, a lot
of previous works exploit invariances of 3D features, e.g.,
perspective-invariance between views of the same scene, modality-invariance
between depth and RGB images, format-invariance between point clouds and
voxels. Although they have achieved promising results, previous researches lack
a systematic and fair comparison of these invariances. To address this issue,
our work, for the first time, introduces a unified framework, under which
various pre-training methods can be investigated. We conduct extensive
experiments and provide a closer look at the contributions of different
invariances in 3D pre-training. Also, we propose a simple but effective method
that jointly pre-trains a 3D encoder and a depth map encoder using contrastive
learning. Models pre-trained with our method gain significant performance boost
in downstream tasks. For instance, a pre-trained VoteNet outperforms previous
methods on SUN RGB-D and ScanNet object detection benchmarks with a clear
margin.

due to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. Rehearsal-based
methods which explicitly store previous task samples in the buffer and
interleave them with the current task samples have proven to be the most
effective in mitigating forgetting. However, Experience Replay (ER) does not
perform well under low-buffer regimes and longer task sequences as its
performance is commensurate with the buffer size. Consistency in predictions of
soft-targets can assist ER in preserving information pertaining to previous
tasks better as soft-targets capture the rich similarity structure of the data.
Therefore, we examine the role of consistency regularization in ER framework
under various continual learning scenarios. We also propose to cast consistency
regularization as a self-supervised pretext task thereby enabling the use of a
wide variety of self-supervised learning methods as regularizers. While
simultaneously enhancing model calibration and robustness to natural
corruptions, regularizing consistency in predictions results in lesser
forgetting across all continual learning scenarios. Among the different
families of regularizers, we find that stricter consistency constraints
preserve previous task information in ER better.

temperature dependence $\tau_{e-ph}^{-1}$ changes from $T^3$ to $T^2$, which

to enter a facility only if it is beneficial enough. Also, after initial
contact, their severities may evolve, which may change their decision. The
hospital system's objective is to allocate service capacity across facilities
so as to minimize costs from patient deaths or defections. We model the system
using a fluid approximation over multiple periods, possibly with different
demand profiles. While the feasible space for this problem can be extremely
complex, it is amenable to decomposition into different sub-regions that can be
analyzed individually, the global optimal solution can be reached via provably
parsimonious computational methods over a single period and over multiple
periods with different demand rates. Our analytical and computational results
indicate that endogeneity results in non-trivial and non-intuitive capacity
allocations that do not always prioritize high severity patients, for both
single and multi-period settings.

formulate an objective and corresponding algorithm which leads to unsupervised
learning of a diverse set of skills through intrinsic motivation given a known

After training, we can leverage the skills as symbolic actions using the
forward model for long-horizon planning and subsequently execute the plan using
the learned continuous-action control skills. The proposed algorithm learns
skills and forward models that can be used to solve complex tasks which require
both continuous control and long-horizon planning capabilities with high
success rate. It compares favorably with other flat and hierarchical
reinforcement learning baseline agents and is successfully demonstrated with a

proceeding as though treatment assignments within matched sets are assigned
uniformly at random and using this distribution as the basis for inference.
This approach ignores observed discrepancies in matched sets that may be
consequential for the distribution of treatment, which are succinctly captured
by within-set differences in the propensity score. We address this problem via
covariate-adaptive randomization inference, which modifies the permutation
probabilities to vary with estimated propensity score discrepancies and avoids
requirements to exclude matched pairs or model an outcome variable. We show
that the test achieves type I error control arbitrarily close to the nominal
level when large samples are available for propensity score estimation. We
characterize the large-sample behavior of the new randomization test for a
difference-in-means estimator of a constant additive effect. We also show that
existing methods of sensitivity analysis generalize effectively to
covariate-adaptive randomization inference. Finally, we evaluate the empirical
value of covariate-adaptive randomization procedures via comparisons to
traditional uniform inference in matched designs with and without propensity
score calipers and regression adjustment using simulations and analyses of

mobile applications, where on-device inference is desirable for crucially
preserving user data privacy and avoiding network roundtrips. Yet, the
unprecedented size of an NLP model stresses both latency and memory, creating a
tension between the two key resources of a mobile device. To meet a target
latency, holding the whole model in memory launches execution as soon as
possible but increases one app's memory footprints by several times, limiting
its benefits to only a few inferences before being recycled by mobile memory
management. On the other hand, loading the model from storage on demand incurs
IO as long as a few seconds, far exceeding the delay range satisfying to a
user; pipelining layerwise model loading and execution does not hide IO either,
due to the high skewness between IO and computation delays.
  To this end, we propose Speedy Transformer Inference (STI). Built on the key
idea of maximizing IO/compute resource utilization on the most important parts
of a model, STI reconciles the latency v.s. memory tension via two novel
techniques. First, model sharding. STI manages model parameters as
independently tunable shards, and profiles their importance to accuracy.
Second, elastic pipeline planning with a preload buffer. STI instantiates an
IO/compute pipeline and uses a small buffer for preload shards to bootstrap
execution without stalling at early stages; it judiciously selects, tunes, and
assembles shards per their importance for resource-elastic execution,
maximizing inference accuracy.
  Atop two commodity SoCs, we build STI and evaluate it against a wide range of
NLP tasks, under a practical range of target latencies, and on both CPU and
GPU. We demonstrate that STI delivers high accuracies with 1-2 orders of
magnitude lower memory, outperforming competitive baselines.

first code, Nyx, solves the Poisson equation using the Particle-Mesh (PM)

\CRKHACC, uses a Tree-PM method to solve for gravity, and an improved
Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique, where fluid

the convergence behavior of the codes in flux statistics as well as the degree
to which the codes agree in the converged limit. We find good agreement overall
with differences being less than observational uncertainties, and a
particularly notable $\lesssim$1\% agreement in the 1D flux power spectrum.
This agreement was achieved by applying a tessellation methodology for
reconstructing the density in \CRKHACC instead of using an SPH kernel as is
standard practice. We show that use of the SPH kernel can lead to significant
and unnecessary biases in flux statistics; this is especially prominent at high
redshifts, $z \sim 5$, as the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest mostly comes from
lower-density regions which are intrinsically poorly sampled by SPH particles.

computed in a systematic post-Newtonian setting without backreaction. This
enables us to reliably estimate the consistency and completeness of less
systematic and more intuitive approaches that attempt to solve this problem by
adding `relativistic effects' by hand. In the second technical part we consider
the question of how quantum matter may act as source for classical
gravitational fields via the semiclassical Einstein equations. Statements to
the effect that this approach is fundamentally inconsistent are critically

generation of Abelian gauge fields due to their nonminimal coupling to gravity

the gauge-field invariants $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ and
$F_{\mu\nu}\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ to an integer power of the scalar curvature
$R^n$ in Jordan frame and, treating these interactions perturbatively, switch
to the Einstein frame where they lead to effective kinetic and axial couplings
between gauge fields and inflaton. We determine the power spectra, energy
densities, correlation length, and helicality of the generated gauge fields for
different values of the nonminimal coupling constants and parameter $n$. We
analytically estimate the spectral index $n_{B}$ of the magnetic power spectrum
and show that for $n>1$ it is possible to get the scale-invariant or even
red-tilted spectrum for a wide range of modes that implies larger correlation
length of the generated fields. On the other hand, the magnitude of these
fields typically decreases in time becoming very small in the end of inflation.
Thus, it is difficult to obtain both large magnitude and correlation length of
the gauge field in the frame of this model.

distance (60.9 kpc) from the Sun, at $\sim$ 17.1 kpc to the East from the Large

generically thermalize to an infinite-temperature state. Recently, however, it
was shown that in random kicked rotors with local interactions, this long-time
equilibrium could be strongly delayed by operating in a regime of weakly
fluctuating random phases, leading to the emergence of a metastable thermal
ensemble. Here we show that when the random kinetic energy is smaller than the
interaction energy, this system in fact exhibits a much richer dynamical phase
diagram, which includes a low-energy pre-thermal phase characterized by a
light-cone spreading of correlations in momentum space. We develop a
hydrodynamic theory of this phase and find a very good agreement with exact
numerical simulations. We finally explore the full dynamical phase diagram of
the system and find that the transition toward full thermalization is
characterized by relatively sharp crossovers.

described in terms of pseudo-spin = 1/2 states. Magnetic interactions among
pseudo-spins, estimated using the second-order perturbation method are highly

antiferromagnetic Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The gaped
spin-wave spectra of Sr$_4$RhO$_6$ obtained with linear spin-wave theory is
consistent with the underlying magnetic frustration. Additional analysis of the

that the spin-wave spectra of Sr$_4$RhO$_6$ is a combined effect of the highly

plausible in the current case. The crucial insights about coupling between the

  Cooperate Amicably",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we introduce the Gulliver multi-party computation model (GMPC).
The GMPC model considers a single highly powerful party, called the server or
Gulliver, that is connected to $n$ users over a star topology network
(alternatively formulated as a full network, where the server can block any
message). The users are significantly less powerful than the server, and, in
particular, should have both computation and communication complexities that
are polylogarithmic in $n$. Protocols in the GMPC model should be secure
against malicious adversaries that may corrupt a subset of the users and/or the
server.
  Designing protocols in the GMPC model is a delicate task, since users can
only hold information about polylog(n) other users (and, in particular, can
only communicate with polylog(n) other users). In addition, the server can
block any message between any pair of honest parties. Thus, reaching an
agreement becomes a challenging task. Nevertheless, we design generic protocols
in the GMPC model, assuming that at most $\alpha<1/6$ fraction of the users may
be corrupted (in addition to the server). Our main contribution is a variant of
Feige's committee election protocol [FOCS 1999] that is secure in the GMPC
model. Given this tool we show:
  1. Assuming fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), any computationally efficient
function with $O\left(n\cdot polylog(n)\right)$-size output can be securely
computed in the GMPC model.
  2. Any function that can be computed by a circuit of $O(polylog(n))$ depth,
$O\left(n\cdot polylog(n)\right)$ size, and bounded fan-in and fan-out can be
securely computed in the GMPC model without assuming FHE.
  3. In particular, sorting can be securely computed in the GMPC model without
assuming FHE. This has important applications for the shuffle model of
differential privacy, and resolves an open question of Bell et al. [CCS 2020].

to the lack of temporal coherence, image-based compression is not sufficient
for the compression of the video task. In this paper, we present a
spatial-temporal compression framework, \textbf{Fast-Vid2Vid}, which focuses on
data aspects of generative models. It makes the first attempt at time dimension
to reduce computational resources and accelerate inference. Specifically, we
compress the input data stream spatially and reduce the temporal redundancy.

synthesize key-frames using the low-resolution data stream. Finally,
Fast-Vid2Vid interpolates intermediate frames by motion compensation with

there are peculiar geometrical changes of the mechanical manifolds that are

theorems, have suggested that a topological theory of phase transitions can be

evolution of twelve first-generation haloes formed from gaussian initial
conditions with scale-free power spectra truncated on small scales by a

or filament-like caustic morphologies, but in almost all cases it gives rise to
a numerically converged density cusp with $\rho = Ar^{-3/2}$ and total mass
comparable to that of the corresponding peak in the initial linear density
field. The constant $A$ can be estimated to within about 10 per cent from the
properties of this peak. This outcome agrees with earlier work on the first
haloes in cold and warm dark matter universes. Within central cusps, the
velocity dispersion is close to isotropic, and the equidensity surfaces tend to
align with those of the main body of the halo at larger radii. As haloes grow,
their cusps are often (but not always) overlaid with additional material at
intermediate radii to produce profiles more similar to the Einasto or NFW forms
typical of more massive haloes. Nevertheless, to the extent that we can resolve
them, cusps survive at the smallest radii. Major mergers can disturb them, but
the effect is quite weak in the cases that we study. The cusps extend down to
the resolution limits of our simulations, which are typically a factor of
several larger than the cores that would be produced by phase-space
conservation if the initial power spectrum cutoff arises from free streaming.

for the production and capture of stars and the compact objects that they leave
behind. These stars produce long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) at their deaths,
while frequent interactions among compact objects form binary neutron stars and
neutron star-black hole binaries, leading to short GRBs (SGRBs) upon their
merger. Predicting the properties of these transients as they emerge from the
dense environments of AGN disks is key to their proper identification and to
better constrain the star and compact object population in AGN disks. Some of
these transients would appear unusual because they take place in much higher
densities than the interstellar medium. Others, which are the subject of this
paper, would additionally be modified by radiation diffusion since they are
generated within optically thick regions of the accretion disks. Here we
compute the GRB afterglow light curves for diffused GRB sources for a
representative variety of central black-hole masses and disk locations. We find
that the radiation from radio to UV and soft X-rays can be strongly suppressed
by synchrotron self-absorption in the dense medium of the AGN disk. In
addition, photon diffusion can significantly delay the emergence of the
emission peak, turning a beamed, fast transient into a slow, isotropic, and
dimmer one. These would appear as broadband-correlated AGN variability with
dominance at the higher frequencies. Their properties can constrain both the
stellar populations within AGN disks as well as the disk structure.

in literature based on the traditional method using only X-ray observations, we
find that the hybrid method provides consistent results to the traditional
method. In addition, we find that the correlation between the traditional
method and the hybrid method improves as the X-ray cavities are more clearly
defined. This suggests that using radio lobes as proxies for cavities may help
to circumvent systematic uncertainties in the cavity volume measurements.
Encouraged by the high volume of unique ILT observations successfully
processed, this hybrid method enables radio-mode feedback to be studied at high

Semianalytical studies of the progenitor halo of a primordial quasar found that

accretion flows creates massive BH seeds without the need for UV backgrounds,
supersonic streaming motions, or even atomic cooling. Cold flows drive violent,
supersonic turbulence in the halo that prevents star formation until it reaches
a mass that triggers sudden, catastrophic baryon collapse that forms 31,000 and

much smaller decay constants, ranging from sub-eV to Planck scales.
Specifically, we show that if there exists a fermion species with strong
self-interactions, the short-wavelength fermion modes form a bound state. This
bound state can then undergo dynamical symmetry breaking and the resulting
pseudoscalar develops Yukawa interactions with the remaining long-wavelength
fermion modes. Due to this new interaction, loop corrections with gravitons
then realize a linear coupling between the pseudoscalar and the gravitational
Chern-Simons term. The strength of this coupling is set by the Yukawa coupling
constant divided by the fermion mass. Therefore, since self-interacting
fermions with small masses are ideal, we identify neutrinos as promising
candidates. For example, if a neutrino has a mass $m_\nu \lesssim {\rm meV}$
and the Yukawa coupling is order unity, the dCS decay constant can be as small

indicate inhomogeneous progress of reionization. To explain the observed large
scatter of the effective Ly$\alpha$ optical depth ($\tau_{\rm eff}$) of the
intergalactic medium (IGM), fluctuation of UV background ($\Gamma$ model) or
the IGM gas temperature ($T$ model) have been proposed, which predict opposite
correlations between $\tau_{\rm eff}$ and galaxy density. In order to address
which model can explain the large scatter of $\tau_{\rm eff}$, we search for
Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) around two (J1137+3549 and J1602+4228) quasar
sightlines with $\tau_{\rm eff}\sim3$ and J1630+4012 sightline with $\tau_{\rm
eff}\sim5.5$. Using a narrowband imaging with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam, we draw
LAE density maps to explore their spatial distributions. Overdensities are
found within 20 $h^{-1}$Mpc of the quasar sightlines in the low $\tau_{\rm
eff}$ regions, while a deficit of LAEs is found in the high $\tau_{\rm eff}$
region. Although the $\tau_{\rm eff}$ of the three quasar sightlines are
neither high nor low enough to clearly distinguish the two models, these
observed $\tau_{\rm eff}$-galaxy density relations all consistently support the
$\Gamma$ model rather than the $T$ model in the three fields, along with the
previous studies. The observed overdensities near the low $\tau_{\rm eff}$
sightlines may suggest that the relic temperature fluctuation does not affect
reionization that much. Otherwise, these overdensities could be attributed to
other factors besides the reionization process, such as the nature of LAEs as
poor tracers of underlying large-scale structures.

pericentre distance of dark matter halos on their first infall into group and
cluster halos. We find that the pericentre distance (R$_{\rm{peri}}$) is an
important parameter as it significantly affects the strength of tidal mass loss
in dense environments, and likely other environmental mechanisms as well. We
examine what determines the R$_{\rm{peri}}$ value and find that, for most
infallers, the dominant parameter is V$_{\rm{\perp}}$, the tangential component
of the orbital velocity as the halo enters the group/cluster halo for the first
time. This means that the strength of tidal stripping acting near the cores of
groups/clusters are strongly influenced by the external peculiar velocity field
of the large scale structure surrounding them, which differs between clusters,
and is sensitive to the mass ratio of infaller to host. We find that filament
feeding also partially contributes to feeding in low V$_{\rm{\perp}}$ halos.
Dynamical friction can also play a role in reducing R$_{\rm{peri}}$ but this is
only significant for those few relatively massive infallers ($>$10\% of the
mass of their host). These results highlight how the response of galaxies to
dense environments will sensitively depend on dynamics inherited from far
outside those dense environments.

of spinning operators in Slightly Broken Higher Spin (SBHS) theories. As an
illustration of the methodology, we work out the three point functions which
reproduce the previously known results. We then work out the four point
functions of spinning operators. We show that the correlation functions of
spinning operators in the interacting SBHS theory take on a remarkably simple
form and that they can be written just in terms of the free fermionic and
critical bosonic theory correlators. They also interpolate nicely between the
results in these two theories. When expressed in spinor-helicity variables we
obtain an anyonic phase which nicely interpolates between the free fermionic
and critical bosonic results which makes 3D bosonization manifest.
  Assuming a form of the five point scalar correlator, we also work out several
five point functions to illustrate how our method can be used in five or higher
point functions. We also put forth a conjecture for any n-point function of
spinning operators in SBHS theories. In this paper we have bootstrapped
correlators using SBHS symmetry in momentum space and spinor helicity
variables. In general, solving the SBHS constraints are complicated to analyse
in position space, but in momentum space and spinor-helicity variables they can
be solved efficiently and this is greatly helped by the recent development of
momentum space CFT correlation functions.

often show a spontaneous amplification of scale height perturbations, produced
by the enhanced absorption of starlight in enlarged regions. In turn, such
regions cast shadows on adjacent zones that consequently cool down and shrink,
eventually leading to an alternating pattern of overheated and shadowed
regions. Previous investigations have proposed this to be a real self-sustained
process, the so-called self-shadowing or thermal wave instability, which could
naturally form frequently observed disk structures such as rings and gaps, and
even potentially enhance the formation of planetesimals. All of these, however,
have assumed in one way or another vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and
instantaneous radiative diffusion throughout the disk. In this work we present
the first study of the stability of accretion disks to self-shadowing that
relaxes these assumptions, relying instead on radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations. We first construct hydrostatic disk configurations by means of an
iterative procedure and show that the formation of a pattern of enlarged and
shadowed regions is a direct consequence of assuming instantaneous radiative
diffusion. We then let these solutions evolve in time, which leads to a fast
damping of the initial shadowing features in layers close to the disk surface.
These thermally relaxed layers grow towards the midplane until all temperature
extrema in the radial direction are erased in the entire disk. Our results
suggest that radiative cooling and gas advection at the disk surface prevent a
self-shadowing instability from forming, by damping temperature perturbations
before these reach lower, optically thick regions.

values and uncertainties for a galaxy's bulge-to-total light ratio ($L_B/L_T$),
effective radius ($R_e$), and flux ($F$). To estimate posteriors, GaMPEN uses
the Monte Carlo Dropout technique and incorporates the full covariance matrix
between the output parameters in its loss function. GaMPEN also uses a Spatial
Transformer Network (STN) to automatically crop input galaxy frames to an
optimal size before determining their morphology. This will allow it to be
applied to new data without prior knowledge of galaxy size. Training and
testing GaMPEN on galaxies simulated to match $z < 0.25$ galaxies in Hyper
Suprime-Cam Wide $g$-band images, we demonstrate that GaMPEN achieves typical
errors of $0.1$ in $L_B/L_T$, $0.17$ arcsec ($\sim 7\%$) in $R_e$, and
$6.3\times10^4$ nJy ($\sim 1\%$) in $F$. GaMPEN's predicted uncertainties are
well-calibrated and accurate ($<5\%$ deviation) -- for regions of the parameter
space with high residuals, GaMPEN correctly predicts correspondingly large
uncertainties. We also demonstrate that we can apply categorical labels (i.e.,
classifications such as ""highly bulge-dominated"") to predictions in regions
with high residuals and verify that those labels are $\gtrsim 97\%$ accurate.
To the best of our knowledge, GaMPEN is the first machine learning framework
for determining joint posterior distributions of multiple morphological
parameters and is also the first application of an STN to optical imaging in
astronomy.

holes reside in massive halos at z > 6 and lead the first stages of galaxy
formation by rapidly growing in mass with a duty cycle of order unity. However,
this duty cycle needs to drastically drop towards lower redshifts, while the

observations by the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.
Following a flare in February 2015, $\epsilon$ Eri's Fe XXI emission declined
by $81\pm5$%. Although enticing, a scant 3.8 min of preflare observations
allows for the possibility that the Fe XXI decline was the decay of an earlier,
unseen flare. Dimming nondetections following each of three prominent flares
constrain the possible mass of ejected Fe XII-emitting (1 MK) plasma to less
than a few $\times10^{15}$ g. This implies that CMEs ejecting this much or more
1 MK plasma occur less than a few times per day on $\epsilon$ Eri. On the Sun,
$10^{15}$ g CMEs occur once every few days. For $\epsilon$ Eri, the mass loss
rate due to CME-ejected 1 MK plasma could be $<0.6$ $\dot{M}_\odot$, well below
the star's estimated 30 $\dot{M}_\odot$ mass loss rate (wind + CMEs). The
order-of-magnitude formalism we developed for these mass estimates can be
broadly applied to coronal dimming observations of any star.

studied the spectral dimension associated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator
generalised to $k$-form fields on spatial slices of the non-perturbative model

the two-form, tensor and dual scalar spectral dimensions exhibit a flow between
two scales at which an effective dimension appears. However, the one-form and
vector spectral dimensions show only a single effective dimension. The fact
that the one-form and vector spectral dimension do not show a flow of the
effective dimension can potentially be related to the absence of a dispersion
relation for the electromagnetic field, but dynamically generated instead of as
an assumption.

undermining democratic processes by promoting ""magical"" thinking, ostracism of

1.9^\circ$ and a pulsar mass $M_{NS} = 2.35\pm 0.17 M_\odot$, the largest

heating is not extreme; the companion lies well within its Roche lobe and a
simple direct-heating model provides the best fit. If the NS started at a
typical pulsar birth mass, nearly $1 M_\odot$ has been accreted; this may be

option in the official JWST pipeline, as a method to extract SOSS spectra by
decontaminating the detector -- that is, separating the first and second
orders. Here, we present APPLESOSS (A Producer of ProfiLEs for SOSS), which
generates the spatial profiles for each diffraction order upon which ATOCA
relies. We validate APPLESOSS using simulated SOSS time series observations of
WASP-52\,b, and compare it to ATOCA extractions using two other spatial
profiles (a best and worst case scenario on-sky), as well as a simple box
extraction performed without taking into account the order contamination. We
demonstrate that APPLESOSS profiles retain a high degree of fidelity to the
true underlying spatial profiles, and therefore yield accurate extracted
spectra. We further confirm that the effects of the order contamination for
relative measurements (e.g., exoplanet transmission or emission observations)
is small -- the transmission spectrum obtained from each of our four tests,
including the contaminated box extraction, is consistent at the $\sim$1$\sigma$
level with the atmosphere model input into our noiseless simulations. We
further confirm via a retrieval analysis that the atmosphere parameters
(metallicity and C/O) obtained from each transmission spectrum are consistent
with the true underlying values.

  Consistency",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many real-world applications of image recognition require multi-label
learning, whose goal is to find all labels in an image. Thus, robustness of
such systems to adversarial image perturbations is extremely important.
However, despite a large body of recent research on adversarial attacks, the
scope of the existing works is mainly limited to the multi-class setting, where
each image contains a single label. We show that the naive extensions of
multi-class attacks to the multi-label setting lead to violating label
relationships, modeled by a knowledge graph, and can be detected using a
consistency verification scheme. Therefore, we propose a graph-consistent
multi-label attack framework, which searches for small image perturbations that
lead to misclassifying a desired target set while respecting label hierarchies.
By extensive experiments on two datasets and using several multi-label
recognition models, we show that our method generates extremely successful
attacks that, unlike naive multi-label perturbations, can produce model
predictions consistent with the knowledge graph.

While there is growing evidence that the atrial fibrillation (AF) has strong
associations with various CVDs, this heart arrhythmia is usually diagnosed
using electrocardiography (ECG) which is a risk-free, non-intrusive, and
cost-efficient tool. Continuously and remotely monitoring the subjects' ECG
information unlocks the potentials of prompt pre-diagnosis and timely
pre-treatment of AF before the development of any life-threatening
conditions/diseases. Ultimately, the CVDs associated mortality could be
reduced. In this manuscript, the design and implementation of a personalized
healthcare system embodying a wearable ECG device, a mobile application, and a
back-end server are presented. This system continuously monitors the users' ECG
information to provide personalized health warnings/feedbacks. The users are
able to communicate with their paired health advisors through this system for
remote diagnoses, interventions, etc. The implemented wearable ECG devices have
been evaluated and showed excellent intra-consistency (CVRMS=5.5%), acceptable
inter-consistency (CVRMS=12.1%), and negligible RR-interval errors (ARE<1.4%).
To boost the battery life of the wearable devices, a lossy compression schema
utilizing the quasi-periodic feature of ECG signals to achieve compression was
proposed. Compared to the recognized schemata, it outperformed the others in
terms of compression efficiency and distortion, and achieved at least 2x of CR
at a certain PRD or RMSE for ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database. To enable
automated AF diagnosis/screening in the proposed system, a ResNet-based AF
detector was developed. For the ECG records from the 2017 PhysioNet CinC
challenge, this AF detector obtained an average testing F1=85.10% and a best
testing F1=87.31%, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

$u$ become locally planar as $t\to+\infty$ ? Namely, does $u(t_n,x_n+\cdot)$
converge locally uniformly, up to subsequences, towards a one-dimensional
function, for any sequence $((t_n,x_n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in
$(0,+\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N$ such that $t_n\to+\infty$ as $n\to+\infty$ ?
This question is in the spirit of a conjecture of De Giorgi for stationary
solutions of Allen-Cahn equations. The answer depends on the initial datum
$u_0$ of $u$. It is known to be affirmative when the support of $u_0$ is
bounded or when it lies between two parallel half-spaces. Instead, the answer
is negative when the support of $u_0$ is ""V-shaped"". We prove here that $u$ is
asymptotically locally planar when the support of $u_0$ is a convex set
(satisfying in addition a uniform interior ball condition), or, more generally,
when it is at finite Hausdorff distance from a convex set. We actually derive
the result under an even more general geometric hypothesis on the support of
$u_0$. We recover in particular the aforementioned results known in the
literature. We further characterize the set of directions in which $u$ is
asymptotically locally planar, and we show that the asymptotic profiles are
monotone. Our results apply in particular when the support of $u_0$ is the
subgraph of a function with vanishing global mean.

dynamical phenomena, including depinning transitions and complex structural
changes. Here, we investigate the behaviour of such systems under pure
oscillatory shearing with shear rate $\dot{\gamma}(t) = \dot{\gamma}_0
\cos(\omega t)$, as it is a common scenario in rheological experiments. The
colloids' depinning behaviour is assessed from a particle level based on
trajectories, obtained from overdamped Brownian Dynamics simulations. The
numerical approach is complemented by an analytic one based on an effective
single-particle model in the limits of weak and strong driving. Investigating a
broad spectrum of shear rate amplitudes $\dot{\gamma}_0$ and frequencies
$\omega$, we observe complete pinning as well as temporary depinning behaviour.
We discover that temporary depinning occurs for shear rate amplitudes above a
frequency-dependent critical amplitude $\dot{\gamma}_0^\mathrm{crit}(\omega)$,
for which we attain an approximate functional expression. For a range of
frequencies, approaching $\dot{\gamma}_0^\mathrm{crit}(\omega)$ is accompanied
by a strongly increasing settling time. Above
$\dot{\gamma}_0^\mathrm{crit}(\omega)$, we further observe a variety of
dynamical structures, whose stability exhibits an intriguing ($\dot{\gamma}_0,
\omega$) dependence. This might enable new perspectives for potential control
schemes.

0--40%. We observe a strong centrality dependence of the polarization with an
increasing signal towards peripheral collisions. For mid-central (20--40%)

observation thus provides a continuation of the increasing trend previously
observed by STAR and contrasts expectations from recent theoretical

GeV. The observed polarization is of a similar magnitude as predicted by 3D
fluid dynamics and the UrQMD plus thermal vorticity model and significantly

radio lobes left from the previous activity have become diffuse and developed
an ultra-steep radio spectrum while rising buoyantly through the confining hot

fluctuation and polarization measurements, Supernovae Ia luminosity distances,
BAO observations and determinations of the growth rate parameter from the Data
Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV. The degenerate neutrino mass
spectrum (which implies $\sum m_\nu>0$) is weakly (moderately) preferred over
the normal and inverted hierarchy possibilities, which imply the priors $\sum
m_\nu>0.06$ and $\sum m_\nu>0.1$ eV respectively. Concerning the underlying
cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM minimal scenario is almost always strongly
preferred over the possible extensions explored here. The most constraining
$95\%$ CL bound on the total neutrino mass in the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$
picture is $\sum m_\nu< 0.087$ eV. The parameter $N_{\rm eff}$ is restricted to
$3.08\pm 0.17$ ($68\%$ CL) in the $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$ model. These

cosmological measurements employed here, the model-marginalized posteriors
obtained considering a large spectra of non-minimal cosmologies are very close
to the previous bounds, obtained within the $\Lambda$CDM framework in the
degenerate neutrino mass spectrum. Future cosmological measurements may improve
the current Bayesian evidence favouring the degenerate neutrino mass spectra,
challenging therefore the consistency between cosmological neutrino mass bounds

CO-estimated masses, mass surface densities, virial masses, virial parameters,
size-linewidth coefficients, and internal turbulent pressures are significantly
higher than in the PHANGS-ALMA galaxies. Cloud radii are slightly larger in NGC
3256 and free-fall times are shorter. The distribution of cloud eccentricities
in NGC 3256 is indistinguishable from many PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, possibly
because the dynamical state of clouds in NGC 3256 is similar to that of nearby
spiral galaxies. However, the narrower distribution of virial parameters in NGC
3256 may reflect a narrower range of dynamical states than in PHANGS-ALMA
galaxies. No clear picture of cloud alignment is detected, despite the large
eccentricities. Correlations between cloud properties point to high external

velocity dispersions and star-formation rates. A fit to the cloud mass function
gives a high-mass power-law slope of $-2.75^{+0.07}_{-0.01}$, near the average

revisits the concept of modular concatenation instead of long and deeper
cascaded connections, to recover a cleaner approximation of the given image. We
find that different modules can capture versatile representations, and
concatenated representation creates a richer subspace for low-level image
restoration. The proposed architecture's number of parameters remains smaller
than the number for most of the previous networks and still achieves
significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art networks.

and Lack, following classic work of Lawvere, and has been generalized to apply
to subcategories of arities in recent work of Bourke-Garner and the authors. We
argue that, while theoretically elegant and structurally fundamental, such
presentations of enriched monads can be inconvenient to construct directly in
practice, as they do not directly match the definitional procedures used in
constructing many categories of enriched algebraic structures via operations
and equations.
  Retaining the above approach to presentations as a key technical
underpinning, we establish a flexible formalism for directly describing
enriched algebraic structure borne by an object of a $V$-category $C$ in terms
of parametrized $J$-ary operations and diagrammatic equations for a suitable
subcategory of arities $J \hookrightarrow C$. On this basis we introduce the
notions of diagrammatic $J$-presentation and $J$-ary variety, and we show that
the category of $J$-ary varieties is dually equivalent to the category of
$J$-ary $V$-monads. We establish several examples of diagrammatic
$J$-presentations and $J$-ary varieties relevant in both mathematics and
theoretical computer science, and we define the sum and tensor product of
diagrammatic $J$-presentations. We show that both $J$-relative monads and
$J$-pretheories give rise to diagrammatic $J$-presentations that directly
describe their algebras. Using diagrammatic $J$-presentations as a method of
proof, we generalize the pretheories-monads adjunction of Bourke and Garner
beyond the locally presentable setting. Lastly, we generalize Birkhoff's Galois

such turbulence is the interplay between local wave--wave interactions between

associated with kinetic micro-instabilities driven by anisotropy in the thermal
pressure (namely, firehose, mirror, and ion-cyclotron). We present theoretical
estimates for, and calculate directly from the simulations, the effective

parallel-viscous scale is comparable to the driving scale of the cascade. Below
this scale, the kinetic-energy spectrum indicates an Alfv\'enic cascade with a
slope steeper than $-5/3$ due to the anisotropic viscous stress. The
magnetic-energy spectrum is shallower than $-5/3$ near the ion-Larmor scale due
to fluctuations produced by the firehose instability. Most of the cascade
energy (80-90%) is dissipated as ion heating through a combination of Landau

\mathbb{R}^n$ in the sampling model $X\sim N_n(\theta, I)$ from the observed
$X$, known as the many-normal-means problem, has proven to be fundamental and
yet challenging inasmuch as a satisfactory understanding remains elusive. To
tackle exact and efficient inference about $\theta$, in this paper we propose
innovative formulations of Inferential Models for two kinds of this problem:
the {\it classic} kind given as is and the {\it empirical-Bayes} kind where
$\theta$'s are further assumed to be an unobservable sample from an unknown
non-parametric distribution $G(.)$. The formulation for the empirical-Bayes
kind via numerical deconvolution allows for prior-free probabilistic inference
with over-parameterization for the non-parametric model $G(.)$, whereas the
formation for the first kind utilizes a latent random permutation and as a
result provides a sound reasoning with uncertainty toward a deeper
understanding. For uncertainty quantification with the more familiar
frequentist inference framework, the method of maximum plausibility estimation
is used for point estimation. Exact but conservative interval estimation is
obtained based on plausibility, with a Monte Carlo based adaptive-adjustment
approach to constructing shorter confidence intervals with targeted coverage.
These methods are illustrated via simulation studies and a real-data example.
The numerical results show that for interval estimation, adaptive intervals are
satisfactory in both coverage and efficiency and that for point estimation, the
proposed methods outperform the traditional James-Stein and Efron's g-modeling
in terms of mean square error. The paper concludes with a few remarks,
including future developments and extensions of the proposed methods.

multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal
predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first
proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the
uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general
CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant
uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty

multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables
the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal
trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the
optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive
experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent
trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic
dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately
approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent
trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily

of this kind, its application to infer the level of consciousness from
empirical data remains elusive. We faced this challenge by calculating entropy
production in a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process fitted to fMRI brain

wakefulness to deep sleep, revealing a monotonous relationship between entropy
production and the level of consciousness. Our results constitute robust
signatures of consciousness while also advancing our understanding of the link
between consciousness and complexity from the fundamental perspective of
statistical physics.

undertake one of its principal missions, the characterization of the
atmospheres of exoplanets. The Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode
of the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) is the only
observing mode that has been specifically designed for this objective. It
features a wide simultaneous spectral range (0.6--2.8\,\micron) through two
spectral diffraction orders. However, due to mechanical constraints, these two
orders overlap slightly over a short range, potentially introducing a
``contamination'' signal in the extracted spectrum. We show that for a typical
box extraction, this contaminating signal amounts to 1\% or less over the
1.6--2.8\,\micron\ range (order 1), and up to 1\% over the 0.85--0.95\,\micron\
range (order 2). For observations of exoplanet atmospheres (transits, eclipses
or phase curves) where only temporal variations in flux matter, the
contamination signal typically biases the results by order of 1\% of the
planetary atmosphere spectral features strength. To address this problem, we
developed the Algorithm to Treat Order ContAmination (ATOCA). By constructing a
linear model of each pixel on the detector, treating the underlying incident
spectrum as a free variable, ATOCA is able to perform a simultaneous extraction
of both orders. We show that, given appropriate estimates of the spatial trace
profiles, the throughputs, the wavelength solutions, as well as the spectral
resolution kernels for each order, it is possible to obtain an extracted
spectrum accurate to within 10\,ppm over the full spectral range.

parameters, ensuring the effectiveness and the adaptiveness of the designed

In stochastic model checking, counterexample generation is a challenging
problem as it is not enough to find a single trace that violates the given

generation for chemical reaction network (CRN) models with potentially infinite

developed for counterexample generation for CRNs. It intends to find a small

due to the highly connected state space of CRNs where a counterexample is only
a tiny subset of all property violating paths. To address such challenges, this
paper presents a number of optimizations including a divide-and-conquer
technique to scale up the counterexample generation method for large CRN

universe. Among its intrinsic properties are its electric charge, mass, and
spin. These emerge from the complex dynamics of its fundamental constituents,
quarks and gluons, described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
Using electron scattering, its electric charge and spin, shared among the quark
constituents, have been the topic of active investigation. An example is the
novel precision measurement of the proton's electric charge radius. In
contrast, little is known about the proton's inner mass density, dominated by
the energy carried by the gluons, which are hard to access through electron
scattering since gluons carry no electromagnetic charge. Here, we chose to
probe this gluonic gravitational density using a small color dipole, the
$J/\psi$ particle, through its threshold photoproduction. From our data, we
determined, for the first time, the proton's gluonic gravitational form
factors. We used a variety of models and determined, in all cases, a mass
radius that is notably smaller than the electric charge radius. In some cases,
the determined radius, although model dependent, is in excellent agreement with
first-principle predictions from lattice QCD. This work paves the way for a
deeper understanding of the salient role of gluons in providing gravitational
mass to visible matter.

policies of transition-independent Markov decision processes (TI-MDPs). We
focus on control of multi-agent systems, whereby a central planner (CP)
influences agents to select desirable group behavior. The agents are
partitioned into disjoint clusters whereby agents in the same cluster receive
the same controls but agents in different clusters may receive different
controls. Under mild assumptions, this process can be modeled as a TI-MDP where
each factor describes the behavior of one cluster. The action space of the
TI-MDP becomes exponential with respect to the number of clusters. To
efficiently find a policy in this rapidly scaling space, we propose a clustered
Bellman operator that optimizes over the action space for one cluster at any
evaluation. We present Clustered Value Iteration (CVI), which uses this
operator to iteratively perform ""round robin"" optimization across the clusters.
CVI converges exponentially faster than standard value iteration (VI), and can
find policies that closely approximate the MDP's true optimal value. A special
class of TI-MDPs with separable reward functions are investigated, and it is
shown that CVI will find optimal policies on this class of problems. Finally,
the optimal clustering assignment problem is explored. The value functions
TI-MDPs with submodular reward functions are shown to be submodular functions,
so submodular set optimization may be used to find a near optimal clustering
assignment. We propose an iterative greedy cluster splitting algorithm, which
yields monotonic submodular improvement in value at each iteration. Finally,
simulations offer empirical assessment of the proposed methods.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of the susceptibility of the

Zhang and Torquato conjectured that any realizable $g_2({\bf r})$ or $S({\bf

attained by a classical equilibrium ensemble involving only (up to) effective
pair interactions. Testing this conjecture for nonequilibrium systems as well
as for nontrivial equilibrium states requires improved inverse methodologies.
We have devised a novel optimization algorithm to find effective pair
potentials that correspond to pair statistics of general translationally
invariant disordered many-body equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems at
positive temperatures. This methodology utilizes a parameterized family of
pointwise basis functions for the potential function whose initial form is
informed by small- and large-distance behaviors dictated by
statistical-mechanical theory. Subsequently, a nonlinear optimization technique
is utilized to minimize an objective function that incorporates both the target
pair correlation function $g_2({\bf r})$ and structure factor $S({\bf k})$ so
that the small- and large-distance correlations are very accurately captured.
To illustrate the versatility and power of our methodology, we accurately
determine the effective pair interactions of the following four diverse target
systems. We found that the optimized pair potentials generate corresponding

distributions on the two diagrams with photoionization models that employ three
nebular parameters: the ionization parameter $U$, hydrogen density
$n_\text{H}$, and gaseous metallicity $Z_\text{gas}$. Our models successfully
reproduce the nebular parameters of local galaxies, and then predict the
distributions of the $z\sim0$, $2$, and $> 6$ galaxies on the diagrams. The
predicted distributions illustrate the redshift evolution on all the diagrams;
e.g., [O III]$/\mathrm{H\beta}$ and [O III]88/[C II]158 ratios continuously
decrease from $z > 6$ to $0$. Specifically, the $z > 6$ galaxies exhibit
$\sim\!0.5$ dex higher $U$ than low-redshift galaxies at a given $Z_\text{gas}$
and show predicted flat distributions on the BPT diagram at $\log{\mathrm{[O
III]/H\beta}} = 0.5$-$0.8$. We find that some of the $z > 6$ galaxies exhibit
high L([O III]88)/SFR ratios. To explain these high ratios, our photoionization
models require a low stellar-to-gaseous metallicity ratio or bursty/increasing
star-formation history at $z > 6$. The James Webb Space Telescope will test the
predictions and scenarios for the $z > 6$ galaxies proposed by our

into two distinctively different effects: the Fermi liquid renormalization
factor and the change in the effective low-energy coupling. The latter quantity
is shown to behave non-monotonically with an extremum at $ r_s\approx 0.75$.
Within the random-phase approximation, Coulomb interaction starts to enhance
the effective pairing coupling at $r_s >2$, and the suppression of the critical

consider a two-band model in a square lattice, where the bands have distinct
effective masses. The incommensurate CDW (inCDW) and CDW phases arise from an
interband Coulomb repulsive interaction, while the SC emerges due to a local
intraband attractive interaction. For simplicity, all the interactions, the
order parameters and hybridization between bands are considered
$\textbf{k}$-independent. The multiband systems that we are interested are
intermetallic systems with a $d$-band coexisting with a large $c$-band, for
which a mean-field approach has proved suitable. We obtain the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian numerically and minimize the free energy
density with respect to the diverse parameters of the model by means of the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem. We investigate the system in real as well as momentum
space and we find an inCDW phase with wave vector $\textbf{Q} = (\pi, Q_y) =

depends on parameters, such as the magnitude of the inCDW and CDW interactions,
band filling, hybridization and the relative depth of the bands. In general,
inCDW tends to emerge at low temperatures, away from half-filling. We also show
that, whether the CDW ordering is commensurate or incommensurate, large values

healthcare since it has a wide-ranging impact on patients and palliative care.
Many survival analysis methods have assumed that the survival data is centrally
available either from one medical center or by data sharing from multi-centers.
However, the sensitivity of the patient attributes and the strict privacy laws
have increasingly forbidden sharing of healthcare data. To address this
challenge, the research community has looked at the solution of decentralized
training and sharing of model parameters using the Federated Learning (FL)
paradigm. In this paper, we study the utilization of FL for performing survival
analysis on distributed healthcare datasets. Recently, the popular Cox
proportional hazard (CPH) models have been adapted for FL settings; however,
due to its linearity and proportional hazards assumptions, CPH models result in
suboptimal performance, especially for non-linear, non-iid, and heavily
censored survival datasets. To overcome the challenges of existing federated
survival analysis methods, we leverage the predictive accuracy of the deep
learning models and the power of pseudo values to propose a first-of-its-kind,
pseudo value-based deep learning model for federated survival analysis (FSA)
called FedPseudo. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach of deriving pseudo
values for survival probability in the FL settings that speeds up the
computation of pseudo values. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our pseudo valued-based FL framework achieves similar
performance as the best centrally trained deep survival analysis model.
Moreover, our proposed FL approach obtains the best results for various
censoring settings.

  Conversely, in the gapped rung singlet phase, the former surface is gapped,
and the latter is gapless. We demonstrate that, although mechanisms of the two
gapless modes are different, nonordinary surface critical behaviors are
realized at both critical points on the gapless surfaces exposed by simply

dynamical viewpoints, we find incomplete CE for the mass asymmetry reaction
systems even in the very deep collisions, and the behavior of ""inverse CE"" that
the tendency of the fragments is away from the $N/Z$ value of the compound

presented in the ImQMD model, the behavior of fast equilibration with the

which is consistent with the experimental data. By performing the systematic

intriguing phenomena of the CE but also provides essential information for

As an expanded task of group activity recognition, social group activity
recognition requires recognizing multiple sub-group activities and identifying
group members. Most existing methods tackle both tasks by refining region
features and then summarizing them into activity features. Such heuristic
feature design renders the effectiveness of features susceptible to incomplete
person localization and disregards the importance of scene contexts.
Furthermore, region features are sub-optimal to identify group members because
the features may be dominated by those of people in the regions and have
different semantics. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose to leverage
attention modules in transformers to generate effective social group features.
Our method is designed in such a way that the attention modules identify and
then aggregate features relevant to social group activities, generating an
effective feature for each social group. Group member information is embedded
into the features and thus accessed by feed-forward networks. The outputs of
feed-forward networks represent groups so concisely that group members can be
identified with simple Hungarian matching between groups and individuals.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on the Volleyball and Collective Activity datasets.

electromagnetic effects couple to the parameters that signal Lorentz-symmetry
violation (LSV). Here, we realize LSV by means of a specific model, namely
Carroll-Field-Jackiw's. We set the formulation by considering a general
non-linear photonic Lagrangian (written in terms of the Lorentz-invariant
bilinears in the field-strength) that may be coupled to different operators
that carry the message of LSV. In possess of the polynomial equation expressing
the dispersion relation and the refractive index, one can find the results that
express how the (meta)material constitutive properties of the vacuum are
affected by the mixing of the parameters that measure LSV with the parameters
of the specific non-linear electrodynamic model under consideration. We expect
that our efforts might be of interest in connection with the experiments
carried out with the existing super-intense LASERs based on chirped pulse
amplification.

the performance of a compact model by transferring the knowledge from a
cumbersome one. The kind of knowledge used to guide the training of the student
is important. Previous distillation methods in semantic segmentation strive to
extract various forms of knowledge from the features, which involve elaborate
manual design relying on prior information and have limited performance gains.
In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective feature distillation method
called normalized feature distillation (NFD), aiming to enable effective
distillation with the original features without the need to manually design new
forms of knowledge. The key idea is to prevent the student from focusing on
imitating the magnitude of the teacher's feature response by normalization. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art distillation results for semantic segmentation
on Cityscapes, VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets. Code will be available.

constructing robust machine perception systems, enabling the recovery of
certifiably globally optimal solutions of challenging estimation problems in
many practical settings. However, solving the large-scale semidefinite
relaxations underpinning this approach remains a formidable computational
challenge. A dominant cost in many state-of-the-art (Burer-Monteiro
factorization-based) certifiable estimation methods is solution verification
(testing the global optimality of a given candidate solution), which entails
computing a minimum eigenpair of a certain symmetric certificate matrix. In
this letter, we show how to significantly accelerate this verification step,
and thereby the overall speed of certifiable estimation methods. First, we show
that the certificate matrices arising in the Burer-Monteiro approach
generically possess spectra that make the verification problem expensive to
solve using standard iterative eigenvalue methods. We then show how to address
this challenge using preconditioned eigensolvers; specifically, we design a
specialized solution verification algorithm based upon the locally optimal
block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method together with a simple
yet highly effective algebraic preconditioner. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of simulated and real-world examples shows that our proposed
verification scheme is very effective in practice, accelerating solution
verification by up to 280x, and the overall Burer-Monteiro method by up to 16x,
versus the standard Lanczos method when applied to relaxations derived from
large-scale SLAM benchmarks.

scheme combined with limiter is proposed for one- and two- dimensional
hyperbolic conservation laws. The fluxes in the governing equation are
approximated by the nonlinear HWENO reconstruction which is the combination of
a quintic polynomial with two quadratic polynomials, where the linear weights
can be artificial positive numbers only if the sum equals one. And other fluxes
in the derivative equations are approximated by high-degree polynomials
directly. For the purpose of controlling spurious oscillations, an HWENO
limiter is applied to modify the derivatives. Instead of using the modified
derivatives both in fluxes reconstruction and time discretization as in the
modified HWENO scheme (J. Sci. Comput., 85:29, 2020), we only apply the
modified derivatives in time discretization while remaining the original
derivatives in fluxes reconstruction. Comparing with the modified HWENO scheme,
the proposed HWENO scheme is simpler, more accurate, efficient and higher
resolution. In addition, the HWENO scheme has a more compact spatial
reconstructed stencil and greater efficiency than the classical fifth-order
finite difference WENO scheme of Jiang and Shu. Various benchmark numerical
examples are presented to show the fifth-order accuracy, great efficiency, high
resolution and robustness of the proposed HWENO scheme.

be further complicated by the transition from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)
vehicles to Electric Vehicles (EVs). EVs offer a range of advantages that
include lower maintenance requirements and independence from costly, dangerous
and polluting petroleum imports that have long been burdensome for remote
communities. Yet the adoption of electric vehicles in Australia has been slow
by international standards, and what policy strategies do exist tend to focus
on incentivizing uptake among urban residents with the means to afford new
technologies, potentially leaving remote communities in the 'too hard basket'.
In this study we assess the feasibility of EVs for a sample of communities in
remote Australia using Geographic Information System analysis of travel
distances between communities and service hub towns utilizing present-day EV
specifications and charging technologies. We show that while EV travel is often
not currently feasible for trips to large service hub towns using low-range
vehicles, over 99% of communities and residents considered would be able to
travel to their nearest small service hub town with existing long-range EVs.
This finding suggests that while the barriers to the electrification of
transport in remote communities are significant, they are not insurmountable
and are deserving of consideration in national and state policy developments in
the deployment of charging infrastructure.

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac82ba",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is a process that removes the interstellar
medium (ISM) quickly, playing a vital role in galaxy evolution. Previous RPS
studies have treated the ISM as single-phase or lack the resolution and
physical processes to properly capture the full multiphase ISM. To improve this
simplification, we introduce an inflowing, hot intracluster medium (ICM) into a
self-consistently modeled ISM in a local patch of star-forming galactic disks
using the TIGRESS framework. Our simulations reveal that the workings of RPS
are not only direct acceleration of the ISM by ICM ram pressure but also
mixing-driven momentum transfer involving significant phase transition and
radiative cooling. The hot ICM passes through the low-density channels of the
porous, multiphase ISM, shreds the cool ISM, and creates mixing layers. The ICM
momentum is transferred through the mixing layers while populating the
intermediate temperature gas and radiating thermal energy away. The mixed gas
extends beyond galactic disks and forms stripped tails that cool back unless
the ICM fluxes are large enough to prevent cooling until they escape the
simulation domain. The mixing-driven momentum transfer predicts that the more
ICM mixes in, the faster the ISM moves, resulting in the anti-correlation of
outflow velocity and gas metallicity of the stripped ISM. The compression of
the ISM disks due to the ICM ram pressure enhances star formation rates up to
50% compared to the model without ICM. With the ICM ram pressure higher than
the disk anchoring pressure, star formation is quenched within ~100 Myr.

the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metasurface-assisted vortex

combined with an intracavity tunable filter, the laser enables OAM beam with
center wavelength continuously tunable from 1015 nm to 1075 nm, nearly twice of
other vortex fiber lasers ever reported. The metasurface can be designed at
will to satisfy requirements for either low pump threshold or high slope

be extended to generate higher-order OAM beams or more complex structured beams
in different wavelength regions, which greatly broadens the possibilities for
developing low-cost and high-quality structured-beam laser sources.

  materials","15 pages with 11 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a general method to analyze the topological nature of the domain
boundary connectivity that appeared in relaxed moir\'e superlattice patterns at
the interface of 2-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials. At large
enough moir\'e lengths, all moir\'e systems relax into commensurated 2D domains
separated by networks of dislocation lines. The nodes of the 2D dislocation
line network can be considered as vortex-like topological defects. We find that
a simple analogy to common topological systems with an $S^1$ order parameter,
such as a superconductor or planar ferromagnet, cannot correctly capture the
topological nature of these defects. For example, in twisted bilayer graphene,
the order parameter space for the relaxed moir\'e system is homotopy equivalent
to a punctured torus. Here, the nodes of the 2D dislocation network can be
characterized as elements of the fundamental group of the punctured torus, the
free group on two generators, endowing these network nodes with non-Abelian
properties. Extending this analysis to consider moir\'e patterns generated from
any relative strain, we find that antivortices occur in the presence of
anisotropic heterostrain, such as shear or anisotropic expansion, while arrays
of vortices appear under twist or isotropic expansion between vdW materials.
Experimentally, utilizing the dark field imaging capability of transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), we demonstrate the existence of vortex and
antivortex pair formation in a moir\'e system, caused by competition between
different types of heterostrains in the vdW interfaces. We also present a
methodology for mapping the underlying heterostrain of a moir\'e structure from
experimental TEM data, which provides a quantitative relation between the
various components of heterostrain and vortex-antivortex density in moir\'e
systems.

generated by collisions between planetesimals. In the ""collisional cascade""

replenished by grinding collisions between planetesimals. The model assumes
that collisions are destructive and involve large velocities; this assumption
has not been tested beyond our Solar System. We present 0""25 ($\approx$2.4 au)
resolution observations of the $\lambda$ = 450 $\mu$m dust continuum emission
from the debris disk around the nearby M dwarf AU Microscopii with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We use parametric models to describe the
disk structure, and an MCMC algorithm to explore the posterior distributions of
the model parameters; we fit the structure of the disk to both our data and
archival $\lambda = 1.3$ mm data (Daley et al. 2019), from which we obtain two
aspect ratio measurements at 1.3 mm ($h_{1300}$ = 0.025$^{+0.008}_{-0.002}$)
and at 450 $\mu$m ($h_{450}$ = 0.019$^{+0.006}_{-0.001}$), as well as the grain
size distribution index $q =$ 3.03 $\pm$ 0.02. Contextualizing our aspect ratio
measurements within the modeling framework laid out in Pan & Schlichting
(2012), we derive a power law index of velocity dispersion as a function of
grain size $p = 0.28 \pm 0.06$ for the AU Mic debris disk. This result implies
that smaller bodies are more easily disrupted than larger bodies by collisions,
which is inconsistent with the strength regime usually assumed for such small
bodies. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.

Performing inferences of CNNs with mixed-sized tensors on such inflexible

accelerators from these two classes, to consequently improve their parallelism,
the flexibility of efficiently mapping tensors of different sizes, speed, and
overall energy efficiency. We evaluate our reconfigurable accelerators against
three prior works for the area proportionate outlook (equal hardware area for
all accelerators). Our evaluation for the inference of four modern CNNs
indicates that our designed reconfigurable CNN accelerators provide
improvements of up to 1.8x in Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and up to 1.5x in FPS/W,

sexual harassment in a public space. Recent tragic incidents involving female
pedestrians have highlighted some of the personal safety issues that women
still face in cities today. There exist many popular location-based safety
applications as a result of this; however, these applications tend to take a
reactive approach where action is taken only after an incident has occurred.
This paper proposes a preventative approach to the problem by creating safer
public environments through societal incentivisation. The proposed system,
called ""Herd Routes"", improves the safety of female pedestrians by generating
busier pedestrian routes as a result of route incentivisation. A novel
application of distributed ledgers is proposed to provide security and trust, a
record of system users' locations and IDs, and a platform for token exchange. A
proof-of-concept was developed using the simulation package SUMO (Simulation of
Urban Mobility), and a smartphone app. was built in Android Studio so that
pedestrian Hardware-in-the-Loop testing could be carried out to validate the
technical feasibility and desirability of the system. With positive results
from the initial testing of the proof-of-concept, further development could
significantly contribute towards creating safer pedestrian routes through
cities, and tackle the societal change that is required to improve female

most of these studies follow the assumption that large-scale labeled data is
available. However, when the labeled data is insufficient for specific domains
due to labor-intensive annotation work, the performance of existing algorithms
will suffer an intolerable decline. In this paper, we endeavor to solve the
problem of few-shot entity linking, which only requires a minimal amount of
in-domain labeled data and is more practical in real situations. Specifically,
we firstly propose a novel weak supervision strategy to generate non-trivial
synthetic entity-mention pairs based on mention rewriting. Since the quality of
the synthetic data has a critical impact on effective model training, we
further design a meta-learning mechanism to assign different weights to each
synthetic entity-mention pair automatically. Through this way, we can
profoundly exploit rich and precious semantic information to derive a
well-trained entity linking model under the few-shot setting. The experiments
on real-world datasets show that the proposed method can extensively improve
the state-of-the-art few-shot entity linking model and achieve impressive

also demonstrate the outstanding ability of the model's transferability.

To this end, we introduce a problem of offline equilibrium finding (OEF) and

each training image. Specifically, we shift the GT bounding boxes of each
labeled human-object pair so that the shifted boxes cover only a certain
portion of the GT ones. We encode the coordinates of the shifted boxes for each
labeled human-object pair into an HOI query. Second, we implicitly construct
another set of hard-positive queries by masking the top scores in
cross-attention maps of the decoder layers. The masked attention maps then only
cover partial important cues for HOI predictions. Finally, an alternate
strategy is proposed that efficiently combines both types of hard queries. In
each iteration, both DETR's learnable queries and one selected type of
hard-positive queries are adopted for loss computation. Experimental results
show that our proposed approach can be widely applied to existing DETR-based
HOI detectors. Moreover, we consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance
on three benchmarks: HICO-DET, V-COCO, and HOI-A. Code is available at

expensive to collect, or simply cannot be used due to privacy concerns.
However, producing good quality synthetic data is challenging. Several
probabilistic, statistical, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) based
approaches have been presented for synthetic tabular data generation. Once
generated, evaluating the quality of the synthetic data is quite challenging.
Some of the traditional metrics have been used in the literature but there is
lack of a common, robust, and single metric. This makes it difficult to
properly compare the effectiveness of different synthetic tabular data
generation methods. In this paper we propose a new universal metric, TabSynDex,
for robust evaluation of synthetic data. TabSynDex assesses the similarity of
synthetic data with real data through different component scores which evaluate
the characteristics that are desirable for ""high quality"" synthetic data. Being
a single score metric, TabSynDex can also be used to observe and evaluate the
training of neural network based approaches. This would help in obtaining
insights that was not possible earlier. Further, we present several baseline
models for comparative analysis of the proposed evaluation metric with existing
generative models.

reduce the threats to user data privacy. Training is done using the raw data on

gradients, are sent to the server to be aggregated and generate an updated
model. However, we cannot assume that the server can be trusted with private

hiding the client information from the server helps reduce privacy-related

privacy of the client's data, is necessary to make such attacks more difficult.
This paper proposes an efficient and privacy-preserving protocol for FL based
on group signature. A new group signature for federated learning, called GSFL,
is designed to not only protect the privacy of the client's data and identity

state-of-the-art systems lack generalisation across different conditions. A key
underlying reason for poor generalisation is the scarcity of emotion datasets,
which is a significant roadblock to designing robust machine learning (ML)
models. Recent works in SER focus on utilising multitask learning (MTL) methods
to improve generalisation by learning shared representations. However, most of
these studies propose MTL solutions with the requirement of meta labels for
auxiliary tasks, which limits the training of SER systems. This paper proposes
an MTL framework (MTL-AUG) that learns generalised representations from

augmented data without requiring any meta labels for auxiliary tasks. The
semi-supervised nature of MTL-AUG allows for the exploitation of the abundant

the features of multi-camera view images and a small part of channel state

discrete attributes may cause inaccurate results. In this work, we propose an
innovative framework to tackle challenging facial discrete attribute synthesis

decompose the discrete attribute representation into two components, i.e. the
semantic prior basis and offset latent representation. The semantic prior basis
shows an initializing direction for manipulating face representation in the
latent space. The offset latent presentation obtained by 3D-aware semantic
fusion network is proposed to adjust prior basis. In addition, the fusion
network integrates 3D embedding for better identity preservation and discrete
attribute synthesis. The combination of prior basis and offset latent
representation enable our method to synthesize photo-realistic face images with
discrete attributes. Notably, we construct a large and valuable dataset MEGN

the lack of discrete attributes in the existing dataset. Extensive qualitative

and categorize popular causal definitions of algorithmic fairness into two
broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on
counterfactual disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally
protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show,
analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions \emph{almost
always} -- in a measure theoretic sense -- result in strongly Pareto dominated
decision policies, meaning there is an alternative, unconstrained policy
favored by every stakeholder with preferences drawn from a large, natural
class. For example, in the case of college admissions decisions, policies
constrained to satisfy causal fairness definitions would be disfavored by every
stakeholder with neutral or positive preferences for both academic preparedness
and diversity. Indeed, under a prominent definition of causal fairness, we
prove the resulting policies require admitting all students with the same
probability, regardless of academic qualifications or group membership. Our
results highlight formal limitations and potential adverse consequences of
common mathematical notions of causal fairness.

linear quadratic games: Given a profile of control strategies, find cost
parameters for which this profile of control strategies is Nash. We formulate
the problem as a leader-followers problem, where a leader aims to implant a
desired profile of control strategies among selfish players. In this paper, we
leverage frequency-domain techniques to develop a necessary and sufficient
condition on the existence of cost parameters for a given profile of
stabilizing control strategies to be Nash under a given linear system. The
necessary and sufficient condition includes the circle criterion for each
player and a rank condition related to the transfer function of each player.
The condition provides an analytical method to check the existence of such cost
parameters, while previous studies need to solve a convex feasibility problem
numerically to answer the same question. We develop an identity in
frequency-domain representation to characterize the cost parameters, which we
refer to as the Kalman equation. The Kalman equation reduces redundancy in the
time-domain analysis that involves solving a convex feasibility problem. Using
the Kalman equation, we also show the leader can enforce the same Nash profile
by applying penalties on the shared state instead of penalizing the player for
other players' actions to avoid the impression of unfairness.

we are going to unveil new wormhole solutions for $f(Q)$ gravity where $Q$ is
the non-metricity scalar, which is responsible for the gravitational
interaction. The energy conditions to constraint these wormhole solutions were
derived using the embedding procedure. This procedure consists of rewriting the

Relativity. Then, the nontrivial contributions coming from new theories of
gravity are embedded into the effective equations for density and pressures.

interactions with superconductivity4. However, spin orbit coupling and crystal
field splitting normally cause a significant magnetic anisotropy for d/f-shell
spins on surfaces6,9, breaking SU(2) symmetry and fabricating the spins with
Ising properties10. Recently, magnetic nanographenes have been proven to host
intrinsic quantum magnetism due to their negligible spin orbital coupling and
crystal field splitting. Here, we fabricate three atomically precise
nanographenes with the same magnetic ground state of spin S=1/2 on Pb(111)
through engineering sublattice imbalance in graphene honeycomb lattice.
Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the coexistence of magnetic bound
states and Kondo screening in such hybridized system. Through engineering the
magnetic exchange strength between the unpaired spin in nanographenes and
cooper pairs, quantum phase transition from the singlet to the doublet state
has been observed, in consistent with quantum models of spins on
superconductors. Our work demonstrates delocalized graphene magnetism host
highly tunable magnetic bound states with cooper pairs, which can be further
developed to study the Majorana bound states and other rich quantum physics of

master and slave. The master problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear
problem where the linear constraints are incrementally augmented using outer
approximations of the slave problem solution. The slave problem addresses the
continuous variables of the optimization problem. The proposed methodology is
tested on three different structural optimization test cases with increasing
complexity. The comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms emphasizes the
efficiency of the proposed methodology in terms of the optimum quality,
computation cost, as well as its scalability with respect to the problem
dimension. A challenging 120-bar dome truss optimization problem with 90
categorical choices per bar is also tested. The obtained results showed that
our method is able to solve efficiently large scale mixed categorical

includes variational autoencoder as a special case and is able to achieve
better expressiveness. CANF-VC also extends the idea of conditional coding to

performed a challenging face-identity matching task that included identical
twins. Participants (N=87) viewed pairs of face images of three types:
same-identity, general imposter pairs (different identities from similar
demographic groups), and twin imposter pairs (identical twin siblings). The
task was to determine whether the pairs showed the same person or different
people. Identity comparisons were tested in three viewpoint-disparity
conditions: frontal to frontal, frontal to 45-degree profile, and frontal to
90-degree profile. Accuracy for discriminating matched-identity pairs from
twin-imposters and general imposters was assessed in each viewpoint-disparity
condition. Humans were more accurate for general-imposter pairs than
twin-imposter pairs, and accuracy declined with increased viewpoint disparity
between the images in a pair. A DCNN trained for face identification (Ranjan et
al., 2018) was tested on the same image pairs presented to humans. Machine
performance mirrored the pattern of human accuracy, but with performance at or

human and machine similarity ratings correlated significantly in six of nine

off-the-shelf object detector to utilize additional image tag information.
However, the object detector is time-consuming and can only identify the
pre-defined object categories, limiting the model capacity. Inspired by the
observation that the texts incorporate incomplete fine-grained image
information, we introduce IDEA, which stands for increasing text diversity via
online multi-label recognition for VLP. IDEA shows that multi-label learning
with image tags extracted from the texts can be jointly optimized during VLP.
Moreover, IDEA can identify valuable image tags online to provide more explicit
textual supervision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IDEA can
significantly boost the performance on multiple downstream datasets with a
small extra computational cost.

teacher-student framework and have achieved state-of-the-art results. However,
the teacher network is tightly coupled with the student network since the
teacher is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student, which causes a
performance bottleneck. To address the coupling problem, we propose a Cycle
Self-Training (CST) framework for SSOD, which consists of two teachers T1 and
T2, two students S1 and S2. Based on these networks, a cycle self-training
mechanism is built, i.e.,
S1${\rightarrow}$T1${\rightarrow}$S2${\rightarrow}$T2${\rightarrow}$S1. For
S${\rightarrow}$T, we also utilize the EMA weights of the students to update
the teachers. For T${\rightarrow}$S, instead of providing supervision for its
own student S1(S2) directly, the teacher T1(T2) generates pseudo-labels for the
student S2(S1), which looses the coupling effect. Moreover, owing to the
property of EMA, the teacher is most likely to accumulate the biases from the
student and make the mistakes irreversible. To mitigate the problem, we also
propose a distribution consistency reweighting strategy, where pseudo-labels
are reweighted based on distribution consistency across the teachers T1 and T2.
With the strategy, the two students S2 and S1 can be trained robustly with
noisy pseudo labels to avoid confirmation biases. Extensive experiments prove
the superiority of CST by consistently improving the AP over the baseline and
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% absolute AP improvements with
scarce labeled data.

reactions from constantly present environmental food sources is considered a
fundamental property in origin-of-life research. Based on Kaufmann's
autocatalytic sets, Hordijk and Steel have constructed the versatile formalism
of catalytic reaction systems (CRS) to model and to analyze such
self-generating networks, which they named reflexively autocatalytic and food
generated (RAF). Previously, it was established that the subsequent and
simultaenous catalytic functions of the chemicals of a CRS give rise to an
algebraic structure, termed a semigroup model. The semigroup model allows to
naturally consider the function of any subset of chemicals on the whole CRS.
This gives rise to a generative dynamics by iteratively applying the function
of a subset to the externally supplied food set. The fixed point of this
dynamics yields the maximal self-generating set of chemicals. Moreover, the
lattice of all functionally closed self-generating sets of chemicals is
discussed and a structure theorem for this lattice is proven. It is also shown
that a CRS which contains self-generating sets of chemicals cannot be nilpotent
and thus a useful link to the combinatorial theory of finite semigroups is
established. The main technical tool introduced and utilized in this work is
the representation of the semigroup elements as decorated rooted trees,
allowing to translate the generation of chemicals from a given set of resources
into the semigroup language.

the eccentricities could be a remnant from their formation. Here we run
numerical simulations using fictitious forces of trapping the fully-grown
planets in resonances as they migrated in the gas disc, followed by numerical
simulations detailing their tidal evolution. For a reduced disc scale height
$h\sim 0.03$--0.05, the eccentricities of the planets upon capture in resonance
are higher than their current values by factors of a few. We show that the
current eccentricities and spacing of planets d to h are natural outcomes of
coupled tidal evolution wherein the planets simultaneously damp their
eccentricities and separate due to their resonant interaction. We further show
that the planets evolve along a set of equilibrium curves in semimajor

format. We consider two distinct modes of operation. In Discovery mode, a
single common data stream is broadcast over a wide angular sector. The radar
receiver must detect the presence of not yet acquired targets and perform
coarse estimation of their parameters (angle of arrival, range, and velocity).
In Tracking mode, the BS transmits multiple individual data streams to already
acquired users via beamforming, while the radar receiver performs accurate
estimation of the aforementioned parameters. Due to hardware complexity and
power consumption constraints, we consider a hybrid digital-analog architecture
where the number of RF chains and A/D converters is significantly smaller than
the number of antenna array elements. In this case, a direct application of the
conventional MIMO radar approach is not possible. Consequently, we advocate a
beam-space approach where the vector observation at the radar receiver is
obtained through a RF-domain beamforming matrix operating the dimensionality
reduction from antennas to RF chains. Under this setup, we propose a likelihood

established to address the distributed tracking control problem for networked
uncertain nonlinear strict-feedback systems with unknown time-varying gains

steps: In the first one, a fully distributed robust filter is constructed to
estimate the desired trajectory for each agent with guaranteed observation
performance that allows the directions among the agents to be non-identical. In
the second one, by establishing a novel lemma regarding Nussbaum function, a
new adaptive control protocol is developed for each agent based on backstepping
technique, which not only steers the output to asymptotically track the
corresponding estimated signal with arbitrarily prescribed transient
performance, but also largely extends the scope of application since the
unknown control gains are allowed to be time-varying and even state-dependent.
In such an indirect way, the underlying problem is tackled with the output
tracking error converging into an arbitrarily pre-assigned residual set
exhibiting an arbitrarily pre-defined convergence rate. Besides, all the
internal signals are ensured to be semi-globally ultimately uniformly bounded
(SGUUB). Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the

underlying reasons are twofold. First, the scene difference is usually more
noticeable and easier to discriminate than the motion difference. Second, the
clips sampled from the same video often share similar backgrounds but have
distinct motions. Simply regarding them as positive pairs will draw the model
to the static background rather than the motion pattern. To tackle this
challenge, this paper presents a novel dual contrastive formulation.
Concretely, we decouple the input RGB video sequence into two complementary
modes, static scene and dynamic motion. Then, the original RGB features are
pulled closer to the static features and the aligned dynamic features,
respectively. In this way, the static scene and the dynamic motion are
simultaneously encoded into the compact RGB representation. We further conduct
the feature space decoupling via activation maps to distill static- and

difficulty for heterogeneous KD (hetero-KD) is the significant semantic gap
between the backbone features of heterogeneous detectors due to the different
optimization manners. Conventional homogeneous KD (homo-KD) methods suffer from
such a gap and are hard to directly obtain satisfactory performance for
hetero-KD. In this paper, we propose the HEtero-Assists Distillation (HEAD)
framework, leveraging heterogeneous detection heads as assistants to guide the
optimization of the student detector to reduce this gap. In HEAD, the assistant
is an additional detection head with the architecture homogeneous to the
teacher head attached to the student backbone. Thus, a hetero-KD is transformed
into a homo-KD, allowing efficient knowledge transfer from the teacher to the
student. Moreover, we extend HEAD into a Teacher-Free HEAD (TF-HEAD) framework
when a well-trained teacher detector is unavailable. Our method has achieved
significant improvement compared to current detection KD methods. For example,
on the MS-COCO dataset, TF-HEAD helps R18 RetinaNet achieve 33.9 mAP (+2.2),

exhibits a hierarchical structure in which larger cities are spaced apart to
serve as centers for surrounding smaller cities, generating a recursive pattern
across different spatial scales. In our theoretical replication of the observed
regularities, diversity in scale economy among industries induces diversity in
their location pattern, which translates into diversity in city size via
spatial coordination of industries and population. The city-size power law is a
generic feature of Monte-Carlo samples of stationary states resulting from the
spontaneous spatial fractal structure in the hypothetical economy. The
identified regularities reveal constraints on feasible urban planning at each

of vision tasks. These models, however, are usually opaque with weak feature
interpretability. Moreover, there is no method currently built for an
intrinsically interpretable transformer, which is able to explain its reasoning
process and provide a faithful explanation. To close these crucial gaps, we
propose a novel vision transformer dubbed the eXplainable Vision Transformer
(eX-ViT), an intrinsically interpretable transformer model that is able to
jointly discover robust interpretable features and perform the prediction.
Specifically, eX-ViT is composed of the Explainable Multi-Head Attention

self-supervised attribute-guided loss. The E-MHA tailors explainable attention
weights that are able to learn semantically interpretable representations from
local patches in terms of model decisions with noise robustness. Meanwhile,
AttE is proposed to encode discriminative attribute features for the target
object through diverse attribute discovery, which constitutes faithful evidence
for the model's predictions. In addition, a self-supervised attribute-guided
loss is developed for our eX-ViT, which aims at learning enhanced
representations through the attribute discriminability mechanism and attribute
diversity mechanism, to localize diverse and discriminative attributes and
generate more robust explanations. As a result, we can uncover faithful and
robust interpretations with diverse attributes through the proposed eX-ViT.

distribution of libration and circulation regions as well as the distribution
of flipping region are analytically explored in the parameter space spanned by
the conserved quantities. The fundamental frequencies of system are produced
and then the nominal location of octupole-order resonance is identified. From
the viewpoint of perturbative theory, the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian
determines the unperturbed dynamical model and the octupole-order Hamiltonian
plays an role of perturbation to the quadrupole-order dynamics. The resonant
Hamiltonian for octupole-order resonances is formulated by means of averaging
theory, giving rise to a new constant of motion. Phase portraits are produced
to analyse dynamical structures of octupole-order resonance, including resonant

analysing phase portraits, it is found that there are four branches of

  Optimization","accepted for publication on IEEE Transactions on Wireless
  Communications",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning (DL) techniques have been intensively studied for the
optimization of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink
systems owing to the capability of handling nonconvex formulations. However,
the fixed computation structure of existing deep neural networks (DNNs) lacks
flexibility with respect to the system size, i.e., the number of antennas or
users. This paper develops a bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) framework, a
scalable DL solution designed for multi-antenna beamforming optimization. The
MU-MISO system is first characterized by a bipartite graph where two disjoint
vertex sets, each of which consists of transmit antennas and users, are
connected via pairwise edges. These vertex interconnection states are modeled
by channel fading coefficients. Thus, a generic beamforming optimization
process is interpreted as a computation task over a weight bipartite graph.
This approach partitions the beamforming optimization procedure into multiple
suboperations dedicated to individual antenna vertices and user vertices.
Separated vertex operations lead to scalable beamforming calculations that are
invariant to the system size. The vertex operations are realized by a group of
DNN modules that collectively form the BGNN architecture. Identical DNNs are
reused at all antennas and users so that the resultant learning structure
becomes flexible to the network size. Component DNNs of the BGNN are trained
jointly over numerous MU-MISO configurations with randomly varying network
sizes. As a result, the trained BGNN can be universally applied to arbitrary
MU-MISO systems. Numerical results validate the advantages of the BGNN
framework over conventional methods.

packets broadcasted by drones/aircrafts for joint range and PO estimation. It
jointly estimates range and PO prior to ADS-B packet decoding; thus, it can
improve air safety when packet decoding is infeasible due to packet collision.
Moreover, it enables coherent detection of ADS-B packets, which can result in
more reliable multiple target tracking in aviation systems using cooperative
sensors for detect and avoid (DAA). By minimizing the Kullback Leibler
Divergence (KLD) statistical distance measure, we show that the received
complex baseband signal coming from K uncoordinated drones corrupted by
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at a single antenna receiver can be
approximated by an independent and identically distributed Gaussian Mixture
(GM) with 2 power K mixture components in the two dimensional (2D) plane. While
direct joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of range and PO from the
derived GM Probability Density Function (PDF) leads to an intractable
maximization, our proposed method employs the Expectation Maximization (EM)
algorithm to estimate the modes of the 2D Gaussian mixture followed by a
reordering estimation technique through combinatorial optimization to estimate
range and PO. An extension to a multiple antenna receiver is also investigated
in this paper. While the proposed estimator can estimate the range of multiple

supported with higher accuracy by the use of multiple antennas at the receiver.
The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is supported by simulation results.

motion capture in recent years, it is still hard for state-of-the-art methods
to obtain satisfactory results in occlusion scenarios. There are two main
reasons: the one is that the occluded motion capture is inherently ambiguous as
various 3D poses can map to the same 2D observations, which always results in
an unreliable estimation. The other is that no sufficient occluded human data
can be used for training a robust model. To address the obstacles, our key-idea
is to employ non-occluded human data to learn a joint-level spatial-temporal
motion prior for occluded human with a self-supervised strategy. To further
reduce the gap between synthetic and real occlusion data, we build the first 3D
occluded motion dataset~(OcMotion), which can be used for both training and
testing. We encode the motions in 2D maps and synthesize occlusions on
non-occluded data for the self-supervised training. A spatial-temporal layer is
then designed to learn joint-level correlations. The learned prior reduces the
ambiguities of occlusions and is robust to diverse occlusion types, which is
then adopted to assist the occluded human motion capture. Experimental results
show that our method can generate accurate and coherent human motions from
occluded videos with good generalization ability and runtime efficiency. The

the problem can be solved with $O(\frac{nk\log n}{\delta^2} +

$\Omega(\frac{nk}{\delta^2})$ queries is known to be necessary. So, for any

the empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm where data from both
distributions are available in the training phase. We further apply the
analysis to approximated ERM methods such as the Gibbs algorithm and the
stochastic gradient descent method. We then generalize the mutual information

for the inversion that guarantees the recovery of high-dimensional sparse

by the observation that the transferability of adversarial examples can be
improved by attacking diverse models simultaneously, model augmentation methods
which simulate different models by using transformed images are proposed.
However, existing transformations for spatial domain do not translate to
significantly diverse augmented models. To tackle this issue, we propose a
novel spectrum simulation attack to craft more transferable adversarial
examples against both normally trained and defense models. Specifically, we
apply a spectrum transformation to the input and thus perform the model
augmentation in the frequency domain. We theoretically prove that the
transformation derived from frequency domain leads to a diverse spectrum

derive analytical expressions for the secrecy transmission capacity to depict

The results indicated a positive association between trust and QE and a

of Fourier transform imaging telescopes. The Hard X-ray Imager (HXI), as one of
the three payloads onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory(ASO-S)
mission, adopts modulating Fourier-Transformation imaging technique and will be
used to explore mechanism of energy release and transmission in solar flare
activities. As an important step to reconstruct the images of solar flares,
accurate modulation functions of HXI are needed. In this paper, a mathematical
model is developed to analyze the modulation function under a simplified
condition first. Then its behavior under six degrees of freedom is calculated
after adding the rotation matrix and translation change to the model. In
addition, unparalleled light and extended sources also are considered so that
our model can be used to analyze the X-ray beam experiment. Next, applied to
the practical HXI conditions, the model has been confirmed not only by Geant4
simulations but also by some verification experiments. Furthermore, how this
model helps to improve the image reconstruction process after the launch of
ASO-S is also presented.

projective 3-space $\mathbb{R}P^3$. These ideas are borrowed from classical
knot theory. Since knots in $\mathbb{R}P^3$ are classified into three disjoint
classes, - affine, class-$0$ non-affine and class-$1$ knots, it is natural to
wonder in which class a given knot belongs to. In this paper we attempt to
answer this question. We provide
  a structure theorem for these knots which helps in describing their behaviour
near the projective plane at infinity.
  We propose a procedure called {\it space bending surgery}, on affine knots to
produce several examples of knots. We later show that this operation can be
extended on an arbitrary knot in $\mathbb{R}P^3$. We also define a notion of
\say{ genus} for knots in $\mathbb{R}P^3$ and study some of its properties. We
prove that this genus detects knottedness in $\mathbb{R}P^3$ and gives some
criteria for a knot to be affine and of class-$1$. We also prove a
\say{non-cancellation} theorem for space bending surgery using the properties
of genus. We produce examples of class-$0 $ non-affine knots with genus $1$.
And finally we study the notion of companionship of knots in $\mathbb{R}P^3$
and using that we provide a geometric criteria for a knot to be affine.
  Thus we highlight that, $\mathbb{R}P^3$ admits a knot theory with a truly
different flavour than that of $S^3$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$.

forecasting.
  Existing prediction research mostly focused on mapping past short sub-series

dataset time series will be discarded, once training is completed. Models can
merely rely on lookback window information for inference, which impedes models
from analyzing time series from a global perspective. And these windows used by
Transformers are quite narrow because they must model each time-step therein.
Under this point-wise processing style, broadening windows will rapidly exhaust
their model capacity. This, for fine-grained time series, leads to a bottleneck
in information input and prediction output, which is mortal to long-term series
forecasting. To overcome the barrier, we propose a brand-new methodology to
utilize Transformer for time series forecasting. Specifically, we split time
series into patches by day and reform point-wise to patch-wise processing,
which considerably enhances the information input and output of Transformers.

vector and mapping, respectively, and to iteratively solve the linearized large
system equation using the Tikhonov regularization method, which is called the
Levenberg-Marquardt scheme. However, this is computationally expensive because
we must construct the larger system equations when the number of available
measurements increases. In this paper, we propose two reconstruction algorithms
based on the Kalman filter. One is the algorithm equivalent to the
Levenberg-Marquardt scheme, and the other is inspired by the Extended Kalman
Filter. For the algorithm derivation, we iteratively apply the Kalman filter to
the linearized equation for our nonlinear equation. Our proposed algorithms
sequentially update the state and the weight of the norm for the state space,
which avoids the construction of a large system equation and retains the

and studied. Non-stationarity is implemented in the timescale representation
through a prior distribution which models the action of time warping on a
stationary signal. A main originality of the approach is that models directly a
timescale representation from which signals can be synthesized, instead of
post-processing a pre-computed timescale transform. A maximum a posteriori
estimator is proposed for the time warping parameters and the power spectrum of
an underlying stationary signal, together with an iterative algorithm, called
JEFAS-S, for the estimation, based upon the Expectation Maximization approach.
Numerical results show the ability of JEFAS-S to estimate accurately time
warping and power spectrum. This is in particular true when time warping
involves fast variations, where a similar approach called JEFAS, proposed
earlier, fails. In addition, as a by-product, the approach is able to yield
extremely sharp timescale representations, also in the case of fast varying
non-stationarity, where standard approaches such as synchrosqueezing fail.

supply chain, such as piracy, reverse engineering, overproduction, and
malicious logic insertion. Many obfuscation approaches have been proposed to
mitigate these threats by preventing an adversary from fully understanding the
IC (or parts of it). The use of reconfigurable elements inside an IC is a known
obfuscation technique, either as a coarse grain reconfigurable block (i.e.,
eFPGA) or as a fine grain element (i.e., FPGA-like look-up tables). This paper
presents a security-aware CAD flow that is LUT-based yet still compatible with
the standard cell based physical synthesis flow. More precisely, our CAD flow
explores the FPGA-ASIC design space and produces heavily obfuscated designs
where only small portions of the logic resemble an ASIC. Therefore, we term
this specialized solution an ""embedded ASIC"" (eASIC). Nevertheless, even for
heavily LUT-dominated designs, our proposed decomposition and pin swapping
algorithms allow for performance gains that enable performance levels that only
ASICs would otherwise achieve. On the security side, we have developed novel
template-based attacks and also applied existing attacks, both oracle-free and
oracle-based. Our security analysis revealed that the obfuscation rate for an
SHA-256 study case should be at least 45% for withstanding traditional attacks
and at least 80% for withstanding template-based attacks. When the 80\%
obfuscated SHA-256 design is physically implemented, it achieves a remarkable
frequency of 368MHz in a 65nm commercial technology, whereas its FPGA
implementation (in a superior technology) achieves only 77MHz.

  codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A locally repairable code is called Singleton-optimal if it achieves the
Singleton-type bound. Such codes are of great theoretic interest in the study
of locally repairable codes. In the recent years there has been a great amount
of work on this topic. One of the main problems in this topic is to determine
the largest length of a q-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable code for
given locality and minimum distance. Unlike classical MDS codes, the maximum
length of Singleton? Optimal locally repairable codes are very sensitive to
minimum distance and locality. Thus, it is more challenging and complicated to
investigate the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes.
In literature, there has been already some research on this problem. However,
most of work is concerned with some specific parameter regime such as small
minimum distance and locality, and rely on the constraint that (r + 1)|n and
recovery sets are disjoint, where r is locality and n is the code length. In
this paper we study the problem for large range of parameters including the
case where minimum distance is proportional to length. In addition, we also
derive some upper bounds on the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally
repairable codes with small minimum distance by removing this constraint. It
turns out that even without the constraint we still get better upper bounds for
codes with small locality and distance compared with known results.
Furthermore, based on our upper bounds for codes with small distance and
locality and some propagation rule that we propose in this paper, we are able
to derive some upper bounds for codes with relatively large distance and
locality assuming that (r + 1)|n and recovery sets are disjoint.

achieved impressive results on various vision tasks. However, how to
effectively combine those operators to form high-performance hybrid visual
architectures still remains a challenge. In this work, we study the learnable
combination of convolution, transformer, and MLP by proposing a novel unified
architecture search approach. Our approach contains two key designs to achieve
the search for high-performance networks. First, we model the very different
searchable operators in a unified form, and thus enable the operators to be
characterized with the same set of configuration parameters. In this way, the
overall search space size is significantly reduced, and the total search cost
becomes affordable. Second, we propose context-aware downsampling modules
(DSMs) to mitigate the gap between the different types of operators. Our
proposed DSMs are able to better adapt features from different types of
operators, which is important for identifying high-performance hybrid
architectures. Finally, we integrate configurable operators and DSMs into a
unified search space and search with a Reinforcement Learning-based search
algorithm to fully explore the optimal combination of the operators. To this
end, we search a baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models,
named UniNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous
ConvNets and Transformers. In particular, our UniNet-B5 achieves 84.9% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming EfficientNet-B7 and BoTNet-T7 with 44% and

methods with a shape function centered at the equilibrium point, the proposed
method utilizes a shifted shape function (SSF) with its center shifted
iteratively towards the boundary of the newly obtained invariant subset to
improve ROA estimation. A set of shifting centers with corresponding SSFs is
generated to produce proven subsets of the exact ROA and then a composition
method, namely R-composition, is employed to express these independent sets in
a compact form by just a single but richer-shaped level set. The proposed
method denoted as RcomSSF brings a significant improvement for general ROA
estimation problems, especially for non-symmetric or unbounded ROA, while
keeping the computational burden at a reasonable level. Its effectiveness and
advantages are demonstrated by several benchmark examples from literature.

additional gauge nonsinglet contributions in the weak interaction, which make
the factorization more elaborate. Especially the nonsinglet contributions arise
due to the Block-Nordsieck violation in electroweak processes, which yields the
Sudakov logarithms and the rapidity divergence. They change the evolution of
the factorized parts considerably in the $N$-jettiness. There are two possible
channels, initiated from the gauge bosons $W W \rightarrow \ell_{\mu}
\overline{\ell}_{\mu}$, and from the electrons $\ell_e \overline{\ell}_e
\rightarrow \ell_{\mu} \overline{\ell}_{\mu}$, where $\ell$ denotes the weak
doublet. The latter was discussed previously, and we complete the analysis by
studying the first. The factorization for $W W \rightarrow \ell_{\mu}
\overline{\ell}_{\mu}$ can be proceeded in a similar way as in the
factorization for $\ell_e\overline{\ell}_e \rightarrow \ell_{\mu}
\overline{\ell}_{\mu}$, and the result exhibits a rich structure. The new
ingredients in this study consist of the $W$ beam functions, and the complex
color structure of the soft functions and the hard functions. The resummation
of the large logarithms is performed by solving the renormalization group
equations with respect to the renormalization scale and the rapidity scale. In
the numerical analysis, we confine to the SU(2) weak gauge interaction, and the
numerical results are presented for both channels at

given images, is a subjective task where the users are with different aesthetic
sensations. Most existing methods deploy a deterministic model to learn the
retouching style from a specific expert, making it less flexible to meet
diverse subjective preferences. Besides, the intrinsic diversity of an expert
due to the targeted processing on different images is also deficiently
described. To circumvent such issues, we propose to learn diverse image
retouching with normalizing flow-based architectures. Unlike current flow-based
methods which directly generate the output image, we argue that learning in a
style domain could (i) disentangle the retouching styles from the image
content, (ii) lead to a stable style presentation form, and (iii) avoid the
spatial disharmony effects. For obtaining meaningful image tone style
representations, a joint-training pipeline is delicately designed, which is
composed of a style encoder, a conditional RetouchNet, and the image tone style
normalizing flow (TSFlow) module. In particular, the style encoder predicts the
target style representation of an input image, which serves as the conditional
information in the RetouchNet for retouching, while the TSFlow maps the style
representation vector into a Gaussian distribution in the forward pass. After
training, the TSFlow can generate diverse image tone style vectors by sampling
from the Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on MIT-Adobe FiveK and
PPR10K datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods and is effective in generating diverse results to
satisfy different human aesthetic preferences. Source code and pre-trained

mainstream paradigm to fine-tune from self-supervised pretrained models to
boost the performance on downstream tasks. However, we find that current SSL
models suffer severe accuracy drops when performing low-bit quantization,
prohibiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. In this
paper, we propose a method called synergistic self-supervised and quantization
learning (SSQL) to pretrain quantization-friendly self-supervised models
facilitating downstream deployment. SSQL contrasts the features of the
quantized and full precision models in a self-supervised fashion, where the
bit-width for the quantized model is randomly selected in each step. SSQL not
only significantly improves the accuracy when quantized to lower bit-widths,
but also boosts the accuracy of full precision models in most cases. By only
training once, SSQL can then benefit various downstream tasks at different
bit-widths simultaneously. Moreover, the bit-width flexibility is achieved
without additional storage overhead, requiring only one copy of weights during
training and inference. We theoretically analyze the optimization process of
SSQL, and conduct exhaustive experiments on various benchmarks to further
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at

recognition of an arbitrary object from its acoustic scattering properties. The
strategy exploits deep neural networks to learn the mapping between the latent
space of a two-dimensional acoustic object and the far-field scattering
amplitudes. A neural network is designed as an Adversarial autoencoder and
trained via unsupervised learning to determine the latent space of the acoustic
object. Important structural features of the object are embedded in
lower-dimensional latent space which supports the modeling of a shape generator
and accelerates the learning in the inverse design process.The proposed inverse
design uses the variational inference approach with encoder and decoder-like
architecture where the decoder is composed of two pretrained neural networks,
the generator and the forward model. The data-driven framework finds an
accurate solution to the ill-posed inverse scattering problem, where non-unique
solution space is overcome by the multifrequency phaseless far-field patterns.
This inverse method is a powerful design tool that does not require complex
analytical calculation and opens up new avenues for practical realization,
automatic recognition of arbitrary shaped submarines or large fish, and other
underwater applications.

interval of the real line, and that are indexed by distinct time instants. The

We establish the auto-regressive model in the tangent space at the Lebesgue

turn to be the Lebesgue measure. Using the theory of iterated random function
systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution
of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the
model coefficient. In addition to the analysis of simulated data, the proposed
model is illustrated with two real data sets made of observations from age
distribution in different countries and bike sharing network in Paris. Finally,
due to the positive and boundedness constraints that we impose on the model
coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints,
naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows furthermore the
application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency
from the multivariate distributional time series.

setting of Sim2Real, unsupervised domain adaptation for category-level 6D
object pose and size estimation. We propose a method that is built upon a novel
Deep Prior Deformation Network, shortened as DPDN. DPDN learns to deform
features of categorical shape priors to match those of object observations, and
is thus able to establish deep correspondence in the feature space for direct
regression of object poses and sizes. To reduce the Sim2Real domain gap, we
formulate a novel self-supervised objective upon DPDN via consistency learning;
more specifically, we apply two rigid transformations to each object
observation in parallel, and feed them into DPDN respectively to yield dual
sets of predictions; on top of the parallel learning, an inter-consistency term
is employed to keep cross consistency between dual predictions for improving
the sensitivity of DPDN to pose changes, while individual intra-consistency
ones are used to enforce self-adaptation within each learning itself. We train
DPDN on both training sets of the synthetic CAMERA25 and real-world REAL275
datasets; our results outperform the existing methods on REAL275 test set under
both the unsupervised and supervised settings. Ablation studies also verify the

the application of techniques from Evolutionary Computation. The main goal of
these approaches is to build models that maximize predictive performance,
sometimes with an additional objective of minimizing computational complexity.
Although the evolved models achieve competitive results performance-wise, their
robustness to adversarial examples, which becomes a concern in
security-critical scenarios, has received limited attention. In this paper, we
evaluate the adversarial robustness of models found by two prominent
NeuroEvolution approaches on the CIFAR-10 image classification task: DENSER and
NSGA-Net. Since the models are publicly available, we consider white-box
untargeted attacks, where the perturbations are bounded by either the L2 or the
Linfinity-norm. Similarly to manually-designed networks, our results show that
when the evolved models are attacked with iterative methods, their accuracy
usually drops to, or close to, zero under both distance metrics. The DENSER
model is an exception to this trend, showing some resistance under the L2
threat model, where its accuracy only drops from 93.70% to 18.10% even with
iterative attacks. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of pre-processing
applied to the data before the first layer of the network. Our observations
suggest that some of these techniques can exacerbate the perturbations added to
the original inputs, potentially harming robustness. Thus, this choice should
not be neglected when automatically designing networks for applications where
adversarial attacks are prone to occur.

relatively small modifications of typical existing PIV systems comprising
pulsed lasers, using dye concentration as a proxy for fluid density. Several
issues have limited such measurements. These include: (1) variations in the
laser intensity and beam structure between laser pulses; (2) PIV particles
concentrating preferentially at their neutral buoyancy depth, thereby yielding
nonuniform dye illumination; and (3) the need to maintain a constant index of
refraction across large stratified fluid volumes. Here we focus on an
experimental setup comprising a stratified layer overlaying a deep homogeneous
region. We produce long internal waves using a lock-release setup, in order to
investigate the structure of waves comprising recirculating fluid regions
(known as ``trapped cores''), which are of current interest in oceanographic
applications. We maintain a short optical path and use velocity information
from PIV data to minimize index-of-refraction issues. We exploit the fact that
the system is initially at rest to devise a mapping that links apparent and
actual dye concentration, thus sidestepping nonuniform illumination issues due
to particle clustering. Finally, we devise a procedure to correct for laser
power variations along each ray in the sheet.

First, the particle distribution functions at cell interfaces are reconstructed

lower-order Allen-Cahn equation is chosen, instead of the higher-order
Cahn-Hilliard equation, to evolve the free-energy based phase field governing
the dynamics of two-phase interfaces. Five benchmark problems are simulated to
demonstrate the capability of the approach in treating two phase flows at large

Earth's rotation with a short solar day of around 5 hours duration. Since then,
Earth gradually transferred angular momentum through tidal friction to the
orbit of the Moon, resulting in an increasing orbital radius and a deceleration
of Earth's rotation. Geologic observations of tidal deposits can be used to
verify and constrain models of lunar orbital evolution. In this work we
reexamine the oldest tidal record suitable for analysis from the Moodies Group,
South Africa, with an age of 3.22 billion years. Time frequency analysis of the
series of thicknesses of the sandstone-shale layers yields a periodicity of
15.0 layers, taking into account the possibility of missing laminae. Assuming a
mixed tidal system, the duration of two neap-spring-neap cycles was 30.0 lunar
days for dominant semidiurnal or 30.0 sidereal days for dominant diurnal tides.
We derive the relationship between this observation and the past Earth-Moon
distance and re-visit related published work. We find that the Earth-Moon
distance 3.2 billion years ago was about 70% of today's value. The Archean
solar day was around 13 hours long. The ratio of solar to lunar tide-raising

performance for deep neural networks. Recent research usually refers to dynamic
noise modeling with model output probabilities and loss values, and then
separates clean and noisy samples. These methods have gained notable success.
However, unlike cherry-picked data, existing approaches often cannot perform
well when facing imbalanced datasets, a common scenario in the real world. We
thoroughly investigate this phenomenon and point out two major issues that
hinder the performance, i.e., \emph{inter-class loss distribution discrepancy}
and \emph{misleading predictions due to uncertainty}. The first issue is that
existing methods often perform class-agnostic noise modeling. However, loss
distributions show a significant discrepancy among classes under class
imbalance, and class-agnostic noise modeling can easily get confused with noisy
samples and samples in minority classes. The second issue refers to that models
may output misleading predictions due to epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric
uncertainty, thus existing methods that rely solely on the output probabilities
may fail to distinguish confident samples. Inspired by our observations, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Label Correction framework~(ULC) to handle label
noise on imbalanced datasets. First, we perform epistemic uncertainty-aware
class-specific noise modeling to identify trustworthy clean samples and
refine/discard highly confident true/corrupted labels. Then, we introduce
aleatoric uncertainty in the subsequent learning process to prevent noise
accumulation in the label noise modeling process. We conduct experiments on
several synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, especially on imbalanced datasets.

diffracts a single X-ray flash before sample damage occurs. The structural
information of the sample can be reconstructed from the coherent X-ray
interference image. State-of-art spatial resolution of such snapshots from
individual heavy element nanoparticles is limited to a few nanometers. Further
improvement of spatial resolution requires higher image brightness which is
ultimately limited by bleaching effects of the sample. We compared snapshots
from individual 100 nm Xe nanoparticles as a function of the X-ray pulse
duration and incoming X-ray intensity in the vicinity of the Xe M-shell
resonance. Surprisingly, images recorded with few femtosecond and
sub-femtosecond pulses are up to 10 times brighter than the static linear model

demonstrating for the very first time the feasibility of unsupervised learning
in networks with many layers of hidden neurons. These hierarchical

them particularly appealing as computational models of human perception and

present iDBN, an iterative learning algorithm for DBNs that allows to jointly
update the connection weights across all layers of the model. We evaluate the
proposed iterative algorithm on two different sets of visual stimuli, measuring
the generative capabilities of the learned model and its potential to support
supervised downstream tasks. We also track network development in terms of
graph theoretical properties and investigate the potential extension of iDBN to
continual learning scenarios. DBNs trained using our iterative approach achieve
a final performance comparable to that of the greedy counterparts, at the same

the encryption of each pixel of the plain image, therefore, bringing in the
desired sensitivity on plaintext as well as ciphertext. All the controlling
pseudorandom sequences used in the algorithm are generated for a different
value of the parameter (part of the secret key) with inter-dependency through
the iterates of the chaotic map (in the generation process) and therefore
possess extreme key sensitivity too. The performance and security analysis has
been executed extensively through histogram analysis, correlation analysis,

also infer vertebrae labels thanks to its Mask R-CNN component (trained to

performance is improved by operator fusion, tensor fusion, and hybrid
parallelism computation, while the memory is optimized through Recompute,
BFloat16, and memory read/write in-place. Compared with the original AlphaFold2

only 7.5 days to complete the full end-to-end training and only 5.3 days when
using hybrid parallelism, while both AlphaFold2 and OpenFold take about 11

To learn more robust representations, we introduce TEmporal Disentanglement

empirically that RL algorithms utilising TED as an auxiliary task adapt more
quickly to changes in environment variables with continued training compared to

supplementing appropriate single-edge capacity bounds. As a result, we develop
tools which provide tight performance bounds for quantum networks constituent
of channels whose capacities are not exactly known, and reveal critical network

$z$=0.296, known to host a powerful radio halo and a relic. Here we present
high fidelity MeerKAT L-band (0.9-1.7 GHz) observations of the Bullet cluster,
in which we trace a larger extent of both the radio halo and relic in
comparison to previous studies. The size of the recovered radio halo is 1.6 Mpc
$\times$ 1.3 Mpc and the largest linear size of the relic is ~988 kpc. We
detect a new decrement feature on the southern outskirts of the halo emission,
where a region appears to have a lower surface brightness in comparison to its
surroundings. The larger extension on the outskirts of the halo is faint, which
suggests lower relativistic electron density or a weaker magnetic field. An
in-band spectral index map of the radio halo reveals a hint of radial
steepening towards the edges of the diffuse source, likely due to synchrotron
electron ageing. The integrated spectral index of the radio halo is
1.1$\pm$0.2. We perform a radio-X-ray surface brightness point-to-point
analysis, which reveals a linear correlation for the radio halo. This indicates
that the radio halo emission is produced by primary re-acceleration mechanisms.
Finally, we derive a radio Mach number of M_R= 4.6$\pm$0.9 for the relic shock
region, which is higher than the Mach number inferred by earlier analyses based
on X-ray data. Discrepancies between radio and X-ray Mach numbers have been
observed for multiple systems, with studies suggesting that this is due to
various factors, including relic orientation.

weakly-supervised audio-visual learning. To address these issues, we propose a
modality-aware contrastive instance learning with self-distillation (MACIL-SD)
strategy. Specifically, we leverage a lightweight two-stream network to
generate audio and visual bags, in which unimodal background, violent, and
normal instances are clustered into semi-bags in an unsupervised way. Then
audio and visual violent semi-bag representations are assembled as positive
pairs, and violent semi-bags are combined with background and normal instances
in the opposite modality as contrastive negative pairs. Furthermore, a
self-distillation module is applied to transfer unimodal visual knowledge to
the audio-visual model, which alleviates noises and closes the semantic gap
between unimodal and multimodal features. Experiments show that our framework
outperforms previous methods with lower complexity on the large-scale

performance in various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that
Next-ViT significantly outperforms existing CNNs, ViTs and CNN-Transformer
hybrid architectures with respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off across
various vision tasks. On TensorRT, Next-ViT surpasses ResNet by 5.5 mAP (from

estimates transferability by first solving an Optimal Transport (OT) problem
between source and target distributions, and then uses the optimal coupling to
compute the Negative Conditional Entropy between source and target labels. It
can also serve as a loss function to maximize the transferability of the source
model before finetuning on the target task. Meanwhile, JC-OTCE improves the
transferability robustness of F-OTCE by including label distances in the OT

demonstrate that F-OTCE and JC-OTCE outperform state-of-the-art auxiliary-free

any nonclassical characteristic due to the presence of strong dissipation. Here
we report an experimental demonstration of the SPT featuring the emergence of a
highly nonclassical photonic field, realized with a resonator coupled to a

Such data plays a significant role in tracking vessel activity and mapping

detect fishing activities, which we approach as a time-series classification

directly matched to compare videos from the same perspective, for example, to
compare whether two actions start similarly. For the focused prototypes, since

part considers a quartic tensor model with $O(N)^3$ symmetry and long-range
propagator. The existence of a non-perturbative fixed point in any $d$ at large
$N$ is established. We found four lines of fixed points parametrized by the
so-called tetrahedral coupling. One of them is infrared attractive, strongly
interacting and gives rise to a new kind of CFT, called melonic CFTs which are
then studied in more details. We first compute dimensions of bilinears and OPE
coefficients at the fixed point which are consistent with a unitary CFT at
large $N$. We then compute $1/N$ corrections. At next-to-leading order, the
line of fixed points collapses to one fixed point. However, the corrections are
complex and unitarity is broken at NLO. Finally, we show that this model
respects the $F$-theorem. The next part of the thesis investigates sextic
tensor field theories in rank $3$ and $5$. In rank $3$, we found two IR stable
real fixed points in short range and a line of IR stable real fixed points in
long range. Surprisingly, the only fixed point in rank $5$ is the Gaussian one.
For the rank $3$ model, in the short-range case, we still find two IR stable
fixed points at NLO. However, in the long-range case, the corrections to the
fixed points are non-perturbative and hence unreliable: we found no precursor
of the large $N$ fixed point. The last part of the thesis investigates the
class of model exhibiting a melonic large $N$ limit. We prove that models with
tensors in an irreducible representation of $O(N)$ or $Sp(N)$ in rank $5$

particular, we formulate the unlearning problem as a constrained maximization
problem by restricting to an $\ell_2$-norm ball around a suitably chosen

unlearning. The method does neither require global access to the data used for

This paper demonstrates that an integrated multi-tiered steering controller
considering the impact of slip on kinematic control, dynamic control, and
steering actuator rate commands achieves accurate and graceful path following.
This work is founded on multi-tiered sideslip and yaw-based models, which allow
derivation of controllers considering error due to sideslip and the mapping
between steering commands and graceful lateral motion. Observer based sideslip
estimates are combined with heading error in the kinematic controller to
provide feedforward slip compensation. Path following error is compensated by a
continuous Variable Structure Controller (VSC) using speed-based path manifolds
to balance graceful motion and error convergence. Resulting yaw rate commands
are used by a backstepping dynamic controller to generate steering rate
commands. A High Gain Observer (HGO) estimates sideslip and yaw rate for output
feedback control. Stability analysis of the output feedback controller is
provided, and peaking is resolved. The work focuses on lateral control alone so
that the steering controller can be combined with other speed controllers.
Field results provide comparisons to related approaches demonstrating
gracefulness and accuracy in different complex scenarios with varied weather

superior retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. However, data are often
scattered in data silos with privacy concerns, so performing centralized data
storage and retrieval is not always possible. Leveraging the concept of
federated learning (FL) to perform deep hashing is a recent research trend.
However, existing frameworks mostly rely on the aggregation of the local deep
hashing models, which are trained by performing similarity learning with local
skewed data only. Therefore, they cannot work well for non-IID clients in a
real federated environment. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
federated hashing framework that enables participating clients to jointly train
the shared deep hashing model by leveraging the prototypical hash codes for
each class. Globally, the transmission of global prototypes with only one
prototypical hash code per class will minimize the impact of communication cost
and privacy risk. Locally, the use of global prototypes are maximized by
jointly training a discriminator network and the local hashing network.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate that
our method can significantly improve the performance of the deep hashing model

existing works treat the temporal axis as a simple extension of spatial axes,
focusing on shortening the spatio-temporal sequence by either generic pooling
or local windowing without utilizing temporal redundancy.
  However, videos naturally contain redundant information between neighboring
frames; thereby, we could potentially suppress attention on visually similar

The ``\textit{P}-Shift'' exchanges features between temporal neighbors to
confront the loss of short-term dynamics. By replacing a vanilla 2D attention
with the LAPS, we could adapt a static transformer into a video one, with zero
extra parameters and neglectable computation overhead ($\sim$2.6\%).

effectiveness for related tasks. Specifically, we propose a light-weight

refine camera position estimation. This procedure achieves a new
state-of-the-art position accuracy for APRs, on both the CambridgeLandmarks and
7Scenes benchmarks. We also show that train images can be reconstructed from

However,
there is still limited work on testing DL libraries, which serve as the
foundations for building, training, and running DL models. Prior work on
fuzzing DL libraries can only generate tests for APIs which have been invoked
by documentation examples, developer tests, or DL models, leaving a large
number of APIs untested. In this paper, we propose DeepREL, the first approach
to automatically inferring relational APIs for more effective DL library
fuzzing. Our basic hypothesis is that for a DL library under test, there may
exist a number of APIs sharing similar input parameters and outputs; in this
way, we can easily ""borrow"" test inputs from invoked APIs to test other
relational APIs. Furthermore, we formalize the notion of value equivalence and
status equivalence for relational APIs to serve as the oracle for effective bug
finding. We have implemented DeepREL as a fully automated end-to-end relational
API inference and fuzzing technique for DL libraries, which 1) automatically
infers potential API relations based on API syntactic or semantic information,
2) synthesizes concrete test programs for invoking relational APIs, 3)
validates the inferred relational APIs via representative test inputs, and
finally 4) performs fuzzing on the verified relational APIs to find potential
inconsistencies. Our evaluation on two of the most popular DL libraries,
PyTorch and TensorFlow, demonstrates that DeepREL can cover 157% more APIs than
state-of-the-art FreeFuzz. To date, DeepREL has detected 162 bugs in total,
with 106 already confirmed by the developers as previously unknown bugs.
Surprisingly, DeepREL has detected 13.5% of the high-priority bugs for the
entire PyTorch issue-tracking system in a three-month period. Also, besides the
162 code bugs, we have also detected 14 documentation bugs (all confirmed).

further imitates the rank distribution of the teacher over clustered candidates

scalability of iterative solvers. However, for highly heterogeneous problems,
where the coefficient function is varying rapidly on several possibly
non-separated scales, the condition number of the preconditioned system
generally depends on the contrast of the coefficient function leading to a
deterioration of convergence. Enhancing the methods by coarse spaces
constructed from suitable local eigenvalue problems, also denoted as adaptive
or spectral coarse spaces, restores robust, contrast-independent convergence.
However, these eigenvalue problems typically rely on non-algebraic information,
such that the adaptive coarse spaces cannot be constructed from the fully
assembled system matrix. In this paper, a novel algebraic adaptive coarse
space, which relies on the a-orthogonal decomposition of (local) finite element
(FE) spaces into functions that solve the partial differential equation (PDE)
with some trace and FE functions that are zero on the boundary, is proposed. In
particular, the basis is constructed from eigenmodes of two types of local
eigenvalue problems associated with the edges of the domain decomposition. To
approximate functions that solve the PDE locally, we employ a transfer
eigenvalue problem, which has originally been proposed for the construction of
optimal local approximation spaces for multiscale methods. In addition, we make
use of a Dirichlet eigenvalue problem that is a slight modification of the
Neumann eigenvalue problem used in the adaptive generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund
(AGDSW) coarse space. Both eigenvalue problems rely solely on local Dirichlet
matrices, which can be extracted from the fully assembled system matrix. By
combining arguments from multiscale and domain decomposition methods we derive
a contrast-independent upper bound for the condition number.

essentially. To solve this complex optimization problem, two popular video
coding frameworks have been developed: block-based hybrid video coding and
end-to-end learned video coding. If we rethink video coding from the
perspective of optimization, we find that the existing two frameworks represent
two directions of optimization solutions. Block-based hybrid coding represents
the discrete optimization solution because those irrelevant coding modes are
discrete in mathematics. It searches for the best one among multiple starting
points (i.e. modes). However, the search is not efficient enough. On the other
hand, end-to-end learned coding represents the continuous optimization solution
because the gradient descent is based on a continuous function. It optimizes a
group of model parameters efficiently by the numerical algorithm. However,
limited by only one starting point, it is easy to fall into the local optimum.
To better solve the optimization problem, we propose to regard video coding as
a hybrid of the discrete and continuous optimization problem, and use both
search and numerical algorithm to solve it. Our idea is to provide multiple
discrete starting points in the global space and optimize the local optimum
around each point by numerical algorithm efficiently. Finally, we search for
the global optimum among those local optimums. Guided by the hybrid
optimization idea, we design a hybrid optimization video coding framework,
which is built on continuous deep networks entirely and also contains some
discrete modes. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments. Compared to the
continuous optimization framework, our method outperforms pure learned video
coding methods. Meanwhile, compared to the discrete optimization framework, our
method achieves comparable performance to HEVC reference software HM16.10 in

Envelope approaches have advantages in analyzing data with highly correlated

envelopes and partial least squares in multivariate linear regression have
promoted recent progress in high-dimensional studies of envelopes, we propose a

iterative Grassmannian optimization alternatives in high dimensions. We develop
a unified NIECE theory that bridges the gap between envelope methods and
principal components in regression. The new theoretical insights also shed
light on the envelope subspace estimation error as a function of eigenvalue
gaps of two symmetric positive definite matrices used in envelope modeling. We
apply the new theory and algorithm to several envelope models, including

imaging to refine the orbits of the three components of the system, A, B and C.
Frequency analysis of the light curves, including from the TESS satellite,
enables characterisation of the rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars.
  A toy model of the circumbinary disk shows that it extends out to
approximately 5 au around the B binary and has an inclination of 73 degrees
with respect to the orbital plane of AB, where the lower bound of the radius of
the disk is constrained by the geometry of the AB orbit and the upper bound is
set by the stability of the disk. We identify several frequencies in the
photometric data that we attribute to rotational modulation of the Aa and Ab
stellar companions. We produce the first determination of the orbit of the more
distant C component around the AB system and limit its inclination to 93
degrees.
  The high inclination and large diameter of the disk, together with the match
from theory suggest that B is an almost equal mass, moderately eccentric
binary. We identify the rotational periods of the Aa and Ab stars, identify a
third frequency in the light curve that we attribute to the orbital period of
the stars in the B binary. We predict that the next eclipse will be around

confidentiality constraints) and, (very) long, in-the-wild videos. For these
reasons, deep learning methodologies tend to overfit, that is, arrive at latent
representations with poor generalisation performance on the final regression
task. To overcome this, in this work, we introduce two complementary
contributions. First, we introduce a novel relational loss for multilabel
regression and ordinal problems that regularises learning and leads to better
generalisation. The proposed loss uses label vector inter-relational
information to learn better latent representations by aligning batch label
distances to the distances in the latent feature space. Second, we utilise a
two-stage attention architecture that estimates a target for each clip by using
features from the neighbouring clips as temporal context. We evaluate the
proposed methodology on both continuous affect and schizophrenia severity
estimation problems, as there are methodological and contextual parallels
between the two. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology
outperforms all baselines. In the domain of schizophrenia, the proposed
methodology outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving
a PCC of up to 78% performance close to that of human experts (85%) and much
higher than previous works (uplift of up to 40%). In the case of affect
recognition, we outperform previous vision-based methods in terms of CCC on
both the OMG and the AMIGOS datasets. Specifically for AMIGOS, we outperform
previous SoTA CCC for both arousal and valence by 9% and 13% respectively, and
in the OMG dataset we outperform previous vision works by up to 5% for both
arousal and valence.

tracking object instances in video sequences. Recent transformer-based neural
networks have demonstrated their powerful capability of modeling
spatio-temporal correlations for the VIS task. Relying on video- or clip-level
input, they suffer from high latency and computational cost. We propose a
robust context fusion network to tackle VIS in an online fashion, which
predicts instance segmentation frame-by-frame with a few preceding frames. To
acquire the precise and temporal-consistent prediction for each frame
efficiently, the key idea is to fuse effective and compact context from
reference frames into the target frame. Considering the different effects of
reference and target frames on the target prediction, we first summarize
contextual features through importance-aware compression. A transformer encoder
is adopted to fuse the compressed context. Then, we leverage an
order-preserving instance embedding to convey the identity-aware information
and correspond the identities to predicted instance masks. We demonstrate that
our robust fusion network achieves the best performance among existing online
VIS methods and is even better than previously published clip-level methods on
the Youtube-VIS 2019 and 2021 benchmarks. In addition, visual objects often
have acoustic signatures that are naturally synchronized with them in
audio-bearing video recordings. By leveraging the flexibility of our context
fusion network on multi-modal data, we further investigate the influence of
audios on the video-dense prediction task, which has never been discussed in
existing works. We build up an Audio-Visual Instance Segmentation dataset, and
demonstrate that acoustic signals in the wild scenarios could benefit the VIS

excites internal inertia-gravity waves through ageostrophic anticyclonic
instability (AAI). This study numerically investigates the breaking of internal
waves and the following turbulence generation resulting from the AAI. In our
simulation, we periodically distort the calculation domain following the
streamlines of an elliptic vortex and integrate the equations of motion using a
Fourier spectral method. This technique enables us to exclude the overall
structure of the large-scale vortex from the computation and concentrate on
resolving the small-scale waves and turbulence. From a series of experiments,
we identify two different scenarios of wave breaking conditioned on the
magnitude of the instability growth rate scaled by the buoyancy frequency,
$\lambda/N$. First, when $\lambda/N\gtrsim0.008$, the primary wave amplitude
excited by AAI quickly goes far beyond the overturning threshold and directly
breaks. The resulting state is thus strongly nonlinear turbulence. Second, if
$\lambda/N\lesssim0.008$, weak wave-wave interactions begin to redistribute
energy across frequency space before the primary wave reaches a breaking limit.
Then, after a sufficiently long time, the system approaches a Garrett-Munk-like
stationary spectrum, in which wave breaking occurs at finer vertical scales.
Throughout the experimental conditions, the growth and decay time scales of the
primary wave energy are well correlated. However, since the primary wave
amplitude reaches a prescribed limit in one scenario but not in the other, the
energy dissipation rates exhibit two types of scaling properties. This scaling
classification has similarities and differences with D'Asaro and Lien's (2000)
wave-turbulence transition model.

cosmological distances, but differences remain in their corrected luminosities
which display a magnitude step as a function of host galaxy properties such as
stellar mass and rest-frame $U-R$ colour. Identifying the cause of these steps
is key to cosmological analyses and provides insight into SN physics. Here we
investigate the effects of SN progenitor ages on their light curve properties
using a galaxy-based forward model that we compare to the Dark Energy Survey
5-year SN Ia sample. We trace SN Ia progenitors through time and draw their
light-curve width parameters from a bimodal distribution according to their
age. We find that an intrinsic luminosity difference between SNe of different
ages cannot explain the observed trend between step size and SN colour. The
data split by stellar mass are better reproduced by following recent work
implementing a step in total-to-selective dust extinction ratio $(R_V)$ between
low- and high-mass hosts, although an additional intrinsic luminosity step is
still required to explain the data split by host galaxy $U-R$. Modelling the
$R_V$ step as a function of galaxy age provides a better match overall.
Additional age vs. luminosity steps marginally improve the match to the data,
although most of the step is absorbed by the width vs. luminosity coefficient
$\alpha$. Furthermore, we find no evidence that $\alpha$ varies with SN age.

component for many online platforms (e.g., video-sharing sites, e-commerce
systems) to make sequential recommendations. Previous works have made many
efforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based
on various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention
mechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone
models to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios.
Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence
representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to
capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items
(e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we
design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced Transformer framework (MBHT) to
capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies.
Specifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank
self-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from
fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally, we incorporate the global
multi-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture
the hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various
state-of-the-art recommendation solutions across different settings. Further
ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of
the new MBHT framework. Our implementation code is released at:

superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) coupled to two heat baths

flux. We investigate how does the heat current modulation depend on the
coupling strength g between the SQUID and the resonators. In the weak coupling
regime the heat current modulation grows as g2, but, surprisingly, at the
intermediate coupling it can be strongly suppressed. This effect is linked to
the resonant nature of the heat transport at weak coupling, where the heat
current dependence on the magnetic flux is a periodic set of narrow peaks. At
the intermediate coupling, the peaks become broader and overlap, thus reducing
the heat modulation. At very strong coupling the heat modulation grows again
and finally saturates at a constant value.

replacement of Ca with monovalent K, is sufficient to achieve $T_c$'s as high

between the B-H $\sigma$ molecular orbitals and bond-stretching phonons. Using
a random sampling of large supercells to estimate the local effects of doping,
we show that the required doping can be achieved without significant disruption

sensitive to the nuclear charge distribution and the infrared-divergence of the
ultra-Lorentz boosted Coulomb field. Within a given experimental kinematic
acceptance, the cross section is found to increase while the pair transverse
momentum ($\sqrt{\langle p_{T}^{2} \rangle}$) decreases with increasing beam
energy. We demonstrate that the transverse-momentum component of
Weizsacker-Williams photons is due to the finite extent of the charge source
and electric field component in the longitudinal direction. We further clarify
the connection between the nuclear charge distribution and the kinematics of
produced $e^+e^-$ from the Breit-Wheeler process, and propose a criterion for
the validity of the Breit-Wheeler process in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Following this approach we demonstrate that the experimental measurements of
the Breit-Wheeler process in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be
used to quantitatively constrain the nuclear charge radius. The extracted
parameters show sensitivity to the impact parameter dependence, and can be used
to study the initial-state and final-state effects in hadronic interactions.

interacting to introduce systematic error. Many instruments collect integer
digitized values and appy nonlinear coding, in particular square-root coding,
to compress the data for transfer or downlink; this can introduce surprising
systematic errors when they are decoded for analysis. Square root coding and
subsequent decoding typically introduces a variable, $\pm 1$ count
value-dependent systematic bias in the data after reconstitution. This is
significant when large numbers of measurements (e.g., image pixels) are
averaged together. Using direct modeling of the probabiliity distribution of
particular coded values in the presence of instrument noise, one may apply
Bayes' Theorem to construct a decoding table that reduces this error source to
a very small fraction of a digitizer step; in our example, systematic error
from square root coding is reduced by a factor of 20 from 0.23 count RMS to
0.013 count RMS. The method is suitable both for new experiments such as the
upcoming PUNCH mission, and also for post facto application to existing data
sets -- even if the instrument noise properties are only loosely known.
Further, the method does not depend on the specifics of the coding formula, and
may be applied to other forms of nonlinear coding or representation of data
values.

develop a novel Efficient Pyramid Network with asymmetrical encoder-decoder

effectively handles the processing difficulties of HD and Ultra-HD images.

large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the PSNR metric

Models (LLMs) can be applied to domains beyond natural language processing,
such as planning and interaction for robots. These embodied problems require an
agent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of
skills available, how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the
world map back to the language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to
consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers
that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we
investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over
sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional
training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to
form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in
robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback,

non-line-of-sight (NLoS) wireless sensing, in which an IRS is dedicatedly
deployed to assist an access point (AP) to sense a target at its NLoS region.
It is assumed that the AP is equipped with multiple antennas and the IRS is
equipped with a uniform linear array. We consider two types of target models,
namely the point and extended targets, for which the AP aims to estimate the
target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) and the target response matrix with respect
to the IRS, respectively, based on the echo signals from the
AP-IRS-target-IRS-AP link. Under this setup, we jointly design the transmit
beamforming at the AP and the reflective beamforming at the IRS to minimize the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation error. Towards this end, we first
obtain the CRB expressions for the two target models in closed form. It is
shown that in the point target case, the CRB for estimating the DoA depends on
both the transmit and reflective beamformers; while in the extended target
case, the CRB for estimating the target response matrix only depends on the
transmit beamformers. Next, for the point target case, we optimize the joint
beamforming design to minimize the CRB, via alternating optimization,
semi-definite relaxation, and successive convex approximation. For the extended
target case, we obtain the optimal transmit beamforming solution to minimize
the CRB in closed form. Finally, numerical results show that for both cases,
the proposed designs based on CRB minimization achieve improved sensing
performance in terms of mean squared error, as compared to other traditional

technique is exact and equivalent to other matrix product state (MPS) based
techniques. For larger depths, it becomes approximate in exchange for an
exponential speed up in computational time. Like an actual quantum computer,
the quality of the DMRG results is characterized by a finite fidelity. However,
unlike a quantum computer, the fidelity depends strongly on the quantum circuit

framework for wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the user
fairness of downlink multi-antenna RSMA in short-packet communications
with/without cooperative (user-relaying) transmission. We design optimal time
allocation and linear precoders that maximize the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) rate
with Finite Blocklength (FBL) constraints. The relation between the MMF rate
and blocklength of RSMA, as well as the impact of cooperative transmission are
investigated for a wide range of network loads. Numerical results demonstrate
that RSMA can achieve the same MMF rate as Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access
(NOMA) and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) with smaller blocklengths (and
therefore lower latency), especially in cooperative transmission deployment.
Hence, we conclude that RSMA is a promising multiple access for guaranteeing
user fairness in low-latency communications.

texturing arbitrary polygon-meshes without an explicit parameterization. Htex
builds upon the insight that halfedges encode an intrinsic triangulation for
polygon meshes, where each halfedge spans a unique triangle with direct
adjacency information. Rather than storing a separate texture per face of the
input mesh as is done by previous parameterization-free texturing methods, Htex
stores a square texture for each halfedge and its twin. We show that this
simple change from face to halfedge induces two important properties for high
performance parameterization-free texturing. First, Htex natively supports
arbitrary polygons without requiring dedicated code for, e.g, non-quad faces.
Second, Htex leads to a straightforward and efficient GPU implementation that
uses only three texture-fetches per halfedge to produce continuous texturing
across the entire mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Htex by rendering
production assets in real time.

produces a supernova (SN) explosion and leaves behind a new neutron star
($\nu$NS) at its center. The accretion of the SN ejecta onto the NS companion
and onto the $\nu$NS via matter fallback spins up the NSs and produces the
double-peak prompt emission. The synchrotron emission from the expanding SN
ejecta with the energy injection from the rapidly spinning $\nu$NS and its

prescribed task space paths is usually broken down into two consecutive
processes: first, the task space path is inverted to obtain a joint-space path,
then, the latter is parametrized with a time law. If the two processes are
separated, they cannot optimize the same objective function, ultimately
providing sub-optimal results. In this paper, a unified approach is presented
where dynamic programming is the underlying optimization technique. Its
flexibility allows accommodating arbitrary constraints and objective functions,
thus providing a generic framework for optimal planning of real systems. To
demonstrate its applicability to a real world scenario, the framework is
instantiated for time-optimality. Compared to numerical solvers, the proposed
methodology provides visibility of the underlying resolution process, allowing
for further analyses beyond the computation of the optimal trajectory. The
effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on a real 7-degrees-of-freedom
serial chain. The issues associated with the execution of optimal trajectories
on a real controller are also discussed and addressed. The experiments show
that the proposed framework is able to effectively exploit kinematic redundancy
to optimize the performance index defined at planning level and generate
feasible trajectories that can be executed on real hardware with satisfactory
results.

loss, Explicit Congestion Notification, delay, etc.) to achieve fast
convergence, high utilization, and fairness among flows. A key limitation of
these congestion signals is that they are either late in feedback or they incur
significant overheads. An ideal congestion control must discover any available
bandwidth in the network, detect congestion as soon as link utilization
approaches full capacity, and react timely to avoid queuing and packet drops,
without significant overheads. To this end, this work proposes Scout service
that leverages priority queues to infer bandwidth availability and link
busyness at the host. The key observation here is that as the high priority
queue (HPQ) gets busier, the low priority queue (LPQ) is served less.
Therefore, the state of the link can be observed from the LPQ and any
congestion can be detected several RTTs earlier than observing the HPQ. We
propose a new transport protocol, Double-Window Transmission Control Protocol
(DWTCP) that builds upon the Scout service to dynamically adjust its congestion
window. Our testbed and simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that Scout
enables a data center transport to achieve high throughput, near-zero queues,
lower latency, and high fairness.

value of its short-time Fourier transform) arises as a key problem in several
important applications, including coherent diffraction imaging and audio

in principle be uniquely recovered up to a global phase factor from its
spectrogram. However, for most practical applications only discrete samples -
typically from a lattice - of the spectrogram are available. This raises the
question of whether lattice samples of the spectrogram contain sufficient
information to determine a function $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ up to a global
phase factor. In recent work this question was answered in the negative for the
case $d=1$, but the higher dimensional case has remained open. In the present
paper, we show that the same non-identifiability result holds in arbitrary
dimensions. Precisely, given any dimension $d$, any window function $g$ and any
(symplectic or separable) lattice $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ we
construct pairs of functions $f,h\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that do not agree up to
a global phase factor, but whose spectrograms agree on $\mathcal{L}$. Our
techniques are sufficiently flexible to produce counterexamples to unique
recoverability under even more stringent assumptions: for example, if the
window function is real-valued, the functions $f,h$ can even be chosen to
satisfy $|f|=|h|$. Our results thus reveal the non-existence of a critical
sampling density in the absence of phase information, a property which is in
stark contrast to uniqueness results in time-frequency analysis.

recognized as one of several major types of noises in superconducting Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Crosstalk arises from the concurrent
execution of two-qubit gates on nearby qubits, such as \texttt{CX}. It might
significantly raise the error rate of gates in comparison to running them
individually. Crosstalk can be mitigated through scheduling or hardware machine
tuning. Prior scientific studies, however, manage crosstalk at a really late
phase in the compilation process, usually after hardware mapping is done. It
may miss great opportunities of optimizing algorithm logic, routing, and
crosstalk at the same time. In this paper, we push the envelope by considering
all these factors simultaneously at the very early compilation stage. We
propose a crosstalk-aware quantum program compilation framework called CQC that
can enhance crosstalk mitigation while achieving satisfactory circuit depth.
Moreover, we identify opportunities for translation from intermediate
representation to the circuit for application-specific crosstalk mitigation,
for instance, the \texttt{CX} ladder construction in variational quantum
eigensolvers (VQE). Evaluations through simulation and on real IBM-Q devices
show that our framework can significantly reduce the error rate by up to
6$\times$, with only $\sim$60\% circuit depth compared to state-of-the-art gate
scheduling approaches. In particular, for VQE, we demonstrate 49\% circuit

adjust classic population models (Gompertz, Logistic, Richards, Bertalanffy) in

these two families of models in order to obtain a more robust and accurate

Shapley Additive Explanation values. As in any other modelling work, data and

the ensemble use of these models improves the individual predictions (using
only machine learning models or only population models) and can be applied,
with caution, in cases when compartmental models cannot be utilized due to the
lack of relevant data.

inherent susceptibility to adversarial examples, which severely hinders the
application of CNNs in security-critical fields. Adversarial examples are
similar to original examples but contain malicious perturbations. Adversarial
training is a simple and effective defense method to improve the robustness of
CNNs to adversarial examples. The mechanisms behind adversarial examples and
adversarial training are worth exploring. Therefore, this work investigates
similarities and differences between normally trained CNNs (NT-CNNs) and
adversarially trained CNNs (AT-CNNs) in information extraction from the mutual
information perspective. We show that 1) whether NT-CNNs or AT-CNNs, for
original and adversarial examples, the trends towards mutual information are
almost similar throughout training; 2) compared with normal training,
adversarial training is more difficult and the amount of information that
AT-CNNs extract from the input is less; 3) the CNNs trained with different
methods have different preferences for certain types of information; NT-CNNs
tend to extract texture-based information from the input, while AT-CNNs prefer
to shape-based information. The reason why adversarial examples mislead CNNs
may be that they contain more texture-based information about other classes.
Furthermore, we also analyze the mutual information estimators used in this
work and find that they outline the geometric properties of the middle layer's
output.

image in a single number. This can then be used for further analyses, e.g. with
statistical methods. However, reducing an aspect of a complex image to a
single, meaningful number is challenging. Thus, methods for calculating retinal
traits tend to be complex, multi-step pipelines that can only be applied to
high quality images. This means that researchers often have to discard
substantial portions of the available data. We hypothesise that such pipelines
can be approximated with a single, simpler step that can be made robust to
common quality issues. We propose Deep Approximation of Retinal Traits (DART)
where a deep neural network is used predict the output of an existing pipeline
on high quality images from synthetically degraded versions of these images. We
demonstrate DART on retinal Fractal Dimension (FD) calculated by VAMPIRE, using
retinal images from UK Biobank that previous work identified as high quality.
Our method shows very high agreement with FD VAMPIRE on unseen test images
(Pearson r=0.9572). Even when those images are severely degraded, DART can
still recover an FD estimate that shows good agreement with FD VAMPIRE obtained
from the original images (Pearson r=0.8817). This suggests that our method
could enable researchers to discard fewer images in the future. Our method can
compute FD for over 1,000img/s using a single GPU. We consider these to be very
encouraging initial results and hope to develop this approach into a useful
tool for retinal analysis.

methods are based on neurological concepts so that they can systematically
derive knowledge from data and store it. One type of machine learning
algorithms that can be categorized as ""deep learning"" model is referred to as
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). DNNs consist of multiple artificial neurons
arranged in layers that are trained by using the backpropagation algorithm.
These deep learning methods exhibit amazing capabilities for inferring and
storing complex knowledge from high-dimensional data. However, DNNs are
affected by a problem that prevents new knowledge from being added to an
existing base. The ability to continuously accumulate knowledge is an important
factor that contributed to evolution and is therefore a prerequisite for the
development of strong AIs. The so-called ""catastrophic forgetting"" (CF) effect
causes DNNs to immediately loose already derived knowledge after a few training
iterations on a new data distribution. Only an energetically expensive
retraining with the joint data distribution of past and new data enables the
abstraction of the entire new set of knowledge. In order to counteract the

players compete to win three aligned ""fields,"" with each field constituting its

player must play in. Prior studies have shown that there exists a forced
winning strategy for the first player, whereby they can win in at least 29
moves and at most 43 moves. This paper proposes a practical solution to the
forced-win problem discovered by Bertholon et al., by putting forth a simple
method for randomizing the first set of moves that are played. This method uses
5 randomly generated digits between 0 and 8 to arbitrarily place the first 4
moves of the game, and helps players avoid forced wins without having to change
other rules of the game. This paper also investigates the probability that a
random placement of the first 4 moves will lead to an easily calculable forced
win, and shows that this probability is precisely 56/59049, or 0.0948%.

reinforcement learning (MARL). Recently, most popular MARL algorithms have
adopted decentralized policies to enable decentralized execution and use
gradient descent as their optimizer. However, there is hardly any theoretical
analysis of these algorithms taking the optimization method into consideration,
and we find that various popular MARL algorithms with decentralized policies
are suboptimal in toy tasks when gradient descent is chosen as their
optimization method. In this paper, we theoretically analyze two common classes
of algorithms with decentralized policies -- multi-agent policy gradient
methods and value-decomposition methods to prove their suboptimality when
gradient descent is used. In addition, we propose the Transformation And
Distillation (TAD) framework, which reformulates a multi-agent MDP as a special
single-agent MDP with a sequential structure and enables decentralized
execution by distilling the learned policy on the derived ``single-agent"" MDP.
This approach uses a two-stage learning paradigm to address the optimization
problem in cooperative MARL, maintaining its performance guarantee.
Empirically, we implement TAD-PPO based on PPO, which can theoretically perform
optimal policy learning in the finite multi-agent MDPs and shows significant

principle is proposed to account for mesoscale eddy effects on the large-scale

the Lagrangian velocity into a smooth-in-time component and a highly
oscillating noise term. One important characteristic of this random model is
that it conserves the total energy of the resolved flow for any realization.
Such an energy-preserving representation is successfully implemented in a well
established multi-layered quasi-geostrophic dynamical core. The empirical
spatial correlation of the unresolved noise is calibrated from the
eddy-resolving simulation data. In particular, a stationary correction drift
can be introduced in the noise through Girsanov transformation. This non
intuitive term appears to be important in reproducing on a coarse mesh the
eastwards jet of the wind-driven double-gyre circulation. In addition, a
projection method has been proposed to constrain the noise living along the
iso-surfaces of the vertical stratification. The resulting noise enables us to
improve the intrinsic low-frequency variability of the large-scale current.

created active distribution systems. Uncontrolled active distribution systems
exhibit wide variations of voltage and loading throughout the day as some of
these resources operate under max power tracking control of highly variable
wind and solar irradiation while others exhibit random variations and/or
dependency on weather conditions. It is necessary to control the system to
provide power reliably and securely under normal voltages and frequency.
Classical optimization approaches to control the system towards this goal
suffer from the dimensionality of the problem and the need for a global
optimization approach to coordinate a huge number of small resources.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods offer an alternative that can provide a
practical approach to this problem. We suggest that neural networks with
self-attention mechanisms have the potential to aid in the optimization of the
system. In this paper, we present this approach and provide promising
preliminary results.

paper-pencil tests but have not yet been fully evaluated for the clinical
evaluation of mild cognitive impairment. The NeuroCognitive Performance Test
(NCPT) is a web-based, self-directed, modular battery intended for repeated
assessments of multiple cognitive domains. Our objective was to examine its
relationship with the ADAS-Cog and MMSE as well as with established
paper-pencil tests of cognition and daily functioning in MCI. We used Spearman
correlations, regressions and principal components analysis followed by a
factor analysis (varimax rotated) to examine our objectives. In MCI subjects,
the NCPT composite is significantly correlated with both a composite measure of
established tests (r=0.78, p<0.0001) as well as with the ADAS-Cog (r=0.55,
p<0.0001). Both NCPT and paper-pencil test batteries had a similar factor
structure that included a large g component with a high eigenvalue. The
correlation for the analogous tests (e.g. Trails A and B, learning memory
tests) were significant (p<0.0001). Further, both the NCPT and established
tests significantly (p< 0.01) predicted the University of California San Diego
Performance-Based Skills Assessment and Functional Activities Questionnaire,
measures of daily functioning. The NCPT, a web-based, self-directed,
computerized test, shows high concurrent validity with established tests and
hence offers promise for use as a research or clinical tool in MCI. Despite
limitations such as a relatively small sample, absence of control group and
cross-sectional nature, these findings are consistent with the growing
literature on the promise of self-directed, web-based cognitive assessments for
MCI.

  Generation",,,,,"q-fin.CP stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The finance industry is producing an increasing amount of datasets that
investment professionals can consider to be influential on the price of
financial assets. These datasets were initially mainly limited to exchange
data, namely price, capitalization and volume. Their coverage has now
considerably expanded to include, for example, macroeconomic data, supply and
demand of commodities, balance sheet data and more recently extra-financial
data such as ESG scores. This broadening of the factors retained as influential
constitutes a serious challenge for statistical modeling. Indeed, the
instability of the correlations between these factors makes it practically
impossible to identify the joint laws needed to construct scenarios.
Fortunately, spectacular advances in Deep Learning field in recent years have
given rise to GANs. GANs are a type of generative machine learning models that
produce new data samples with the same characteristics as a training data
distribution in an unsupervised way, avoiding data assumptions and human
induced biases. In this work, we are exploring the use of GANs for synthetic
financial scenarios generation. This pilot study is the result of a
collaboration between Fujitsu and Advestis and it will be followed by a
thorough exploration of the use cases that can benefit from the proposed
solution. We propose a GANs-based algorithm that allows the replication of
multivariate data representing several properties (including, but not limited
to, price, market capitalization, ESG score, controversy score,. . .) of a set
of stocks. This approach differs from examples in the financial literature,
which are mainly focused on the reproduction of temporal asset price scenarios.
We also propose several metrics to evaluate the quality of the data generated
by the GANs. This approach is well fit for the generation of scenarios, the
time direction simply arising as a subsequent (eventually conditioned)
generation of data points drawn from the learned distribution. Our method will
allow to simulate high dimensional scenarios (compared to $\lesssim 10$
features currently employed in most recent use cases) where network complexity
is reduced thanks to a wisely performed feature engineering and selection.
Complete results will be presented in a forthcoming study.

pre-processing is essential for the simulation accuracy of the particle-based
methods. In this paper, several level-set based techniques for cleaning up
`dirty' geometries automatically and generating homogeneous particle
distributions are presented. First, a non-resolved structure identifying method
based on level-set field is employed to detect the tiny fragments which make
the geometry `dirty' under a given resolutions. Second, a re-distance algorithm
is proposed to remove the tiny fragments and reconstruct clean and smooth
geometries. Third, a `static confinement' boundary condition is developed in
the particle relaxation process. By complementing the kernel support for the
particles near the geometric surface, the boundary condition achieves better
body-fitted particle distribution on the narrow region with high curvature.
Several numerical examples include a 2D airfoil 30P30N, 3D SPHinXsys symbol, a
skyscraper with a flagpole and an inferior vena cava demonstrate that the
present method not only cleans up the `dirty' geometries efficiently, but also
provides better body-fitted homogeneous particle distribution for complex
geometry.

Administration (FDA) has kept a robust record of regulated medical devices
(MDs). Based on these data, can we gain insight into the innovation dynamics of
the industry, including the potential for industrial transformation? Areas
Covered: Using Premarket Notifications (PMNs) and Approvals (PMAs) data, it is
shown that from 1976 to 2020 the total composite (PMN + PMA) metric follows a
single secular period: 20.5 years (applications peak-to-peak: 1992-2012;
trough: 2002) and 26.5 years (registrations peak to peak: 1992 to 2019; trough:
2003), with a peak to trough relative percentage difference of 24% and 28%,
respectively. Importantly, PMNs and PMAs independently present as an inverse
structure. Expert Opinion: The evidence suggests: MD innovation is driven by a
singular secular Kutnets-like cyclic phenomenon (independent of economic
crises) derived from a fundamental shift from simple (PMNs) to complex (PMAs)
MDs. Portentously, while the COVID-19 crisis may not affect the overriding
dynamic, the anticipated yet significant (~25%) MD innovation drop may be
potentially attenuated with attentive measures by MD stakeholders. Limitations
of this approach and further thoughts complete this perspective.
