images, even when these images are out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This
limits the applications of neural network models in real-world scenarios, where
OOD samples exist. Many existing approaches identify the OOD instances via
exploiting various cues, such as finding irregular patterns in the feature
space, logits space, gradient space or the raw space of images. In contrast,
this paper proposes a simple Test-time Linear Training (ETLT) method for OOD
detection. Empirically, we find that the probabilities of input images being
out-of-distribution are surprisingly linearly correlated to the features
extracted by neural networks. To be specific, many state-of-the-art OOD
algorithms, although designed to measure reliability in different ways,
actually lead to OOD scores mostly linearly related to their image features.
Thus, by simply learning a linear regression model trained from the paired
image features and inferred OOD scores at test-time, we can make a more precise
OOD prediction for the test instances. We further propose an online variant of
the proposed method, which achieves promising performance and is more practical
in real-world applications. Remarkably, we improve FPR95 from $51.37\%$ to
$12.30\%$ on CIFAR-10 datasets with maximum softmax probability as the base OOD
detector. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the efficacy
of ETLT for OOD detection task.

carried out in two steps: we first construct Hilbert spaces to accommodate the
functional covariate and the functional response, and then build a second-layer
Hilbert space for the covariate to capture nonlinearity. The second-layer space
is assumed to be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is generated by a
positive definite kernel determined by the inner product of the first-layer

develop estimation procedures to implement the proposed method, which allows
the functional data to be observed at different time points for different

  Uplink Communications","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase noise (PN) is a major disturbance in MIMO systems, where the
contribution of different oscillators at the transmitter and the receiver side
may degrade the overall performance and offset the gains offered by MIMO
techniques. This is even more crucial in the case of massive MIMO, since the
number of PN sources may increase considerably. In this work, we propose an
iterative receiver based on the application of the expectation-maximization
algorithm. We consider a massive MIMO framework with a general association of
oscillators to antennas, and include other channel disturbances like imperfect
channel state information and Rician block fading. At each receiver iteration,
given the information on the transmitted symbols, steepest descent is used to
estimate the PN samples, with an optimized adaptive step size and a
threshold-based stopping rule. The results obtained for several test cases show
how the bit error rate and mean square error can benefit from the proposed
phase-detection algorithm, even to the point of reaching the same performance
as in the case where no PN is present. Further analysis of the results allow to
draw some useful trade-offs respecting final performance and consumption of

positions simultaneously along with the robot poses. We further analyze the
observability of the visual-inertial-ranging estimators and proved that there
are \textit{four} unobservable directions in the ideal case, while one of them
vanishes in the actual case due to the gain of spurious information. Based on
these analyses, we leverage the FEJ technique to enforce the unobservable
directions, hence reducing inconsistency of the estimator. Finally, we validate
our analysis and evaluate the proposed FEJ-VIRO with both simulation and

field, instead of focusing on a single extremal curve. Second, we assume that
there is a scale, below which we can only probabilistically assess which
extremal curve in the ensemble is actually realized. The continuity equation
ruling the conservation of probability represents a subsidiary condition for
Hamilton's principle. As a consequence, the ensemble of extremals acquires a
dynamics that is ruled by Maxwell equations. These equations are thus shown to
also rule some non-electromagnetic phenomena. While particles follow
well-defined trajectories, the field of extremals can display wave behavior.

investigated twelve high-mass star-forming regions using the ALMA band 6
observations. They are associated with 44/95GHz class I and 6.7 GHz class II
CH$_{3}$OH masers, indicative of undergoing active accretion. We found 28 hot
cores with COMs emission among 68 continuum peaks at 1.3 mm and specified 10
hot cores associated with 6.7 GHz class II CH$_{3}$OH masers. Up to 19 COMs are
identified including oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing molecules and their
isotopologues in cores. The derived abundances show a good agreement with those
from other low- and high-mass star-forming regions, implying that the COMs
chemistry is predominantly set by the ice chemistry in the prestellar core
stage. One clear trend is that the COMs detection rate steeply grows with the
gas column density, which can be attributed to the efficient formation of COMs
in dense cores. In addition, cores associated with a 6.7 GHz class II
CH$_{3}$OH maser tend to be enriched with COMs. Finally, our results suggest

ability to provide contextualized word embeddings that better capture the
nuances and subtleties of language use in online social media. Additionally, we
found that CNN and GRU encoders performed similarly in terms of F1 score and

detected by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. These sources are magnified by
1.4--2.1$\times$due to gravitational lensing. This is the first time that SMG
host galaxies are resolved in the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR). One source
was previous undetected by HST, while the remaining two are disk galaxies with
S\'ersic indices of $\sim 0.9$ and star formation rates on or just below the
star formation ""main sequence"". Their submillimeter emission originates from
the inner parts of the hosts, suggesting that their dust contents are
concentrated towards the center. The host half-light radii measured in the
rest-frame NIR are $\sim$1.5$\times$ smaller than those measured in the
rest-frame optical, consistent with a concentrated dust distribution. The more
severe extinction that optical light suffers towards the center makes it
seemingly less concentrated. Therefore, we expect that the optically-based
determination of the stellar mass distribution within host galaxies could still
be severely biased by dust. Interestingly, these two disk galaxies are
dramatically different in their outer regions, with one being star forming and
the other being quiescent. Upcoming JWST observations of statistically
significant samples of SMGs will allow us to understand the correlation between
the dusty star forming regions and their hosts.

to assume a parametric model for the cure probability and a semiparametric

claim is that the Nekrasov functions emerge in matrix models as a
straightforward implication of superintegrability, factorization of peculiar

Hermitian model, the factorization property can be extended from averages of
single characters to their bilinear combinations. In this paper, we claim that
this is true also for multi-logarithmic matrix models, where factorized are
just the point-split products of two characters. It is this enhanced
superintegrability that is responsible for existence of the Nekrasov functions

models, thus leading to AGT relations for multi-point conformal blocks, and to
DV phases of other non-Gaussian models.

transport properties of a large class of materials characterized by strong
electron-phonon coupling. Even in the one-dimensional case, simulating the
quantum dynamics of such a system with high accuracy is very challenging due to
the infinite-dimensionality of the phononic Hilbert spaces. The difficulties
tend to become even more severe when considering the incoherent coupling of the
phonon-system to a practically inevitable environment. For this reason, the
effects of dissipation on the metallicity of such systems have not been
investigated systematically so far. In this article, we close this gap by
combining the non-Markovian hierarchy of pure states method and the Markovian
quantum jumps method with the newly introduced projected purified
density-matrix renormalization group, creating powerful tensor network methods
for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Investigating their numerical
properties, we find a significant speedup up to a factor $\sim 30$ compared to
conventional tensor-network techniques. We apply these methods to study
quenches of the Hubbard-Holstein model, aiming for an in-depth understanding of
the formation, stability, and quasi-particle properties of bipolarons. Our
results show that in the metallic phase, dissipation localizes the bipolarons.
However, the bipolaronic binding energy remains mainly unaffected, even in the
presence of strong dissipation, exhibiting remarkable bipolaron stability.
These findings shed new light on the problem of designing real materials

that a dual norm of the {convective derivative of the} error must be added to
the natural energy norm in order for the natural residual estimator to be
reliable and efficient. We show that the situation is similar for the maximum
norm. In particular, we define a mesh-dependent weighted seminorm of the
convective error which functions as a maximum-norm counterpart to the dual norm
used in the energy norm setting. The total error is then defined as the sum of
this seminorm, the maximum norm of the error, and data oscillation. The natural
maximum norm residual error estimator is shown to be equivalent to this total
error notion, with constant independent of singular perturbation parameters.
These estimates are proved under the assumption that certain natural estimates
hold for the Green's function for the problem at hand. Numerical experiments
confirm that our estimators effectively capture the maximum-norm error behavior
for singularly perturbed problems, and can effectively drive adaptive
refinement in order to capture layer phenomena.

$\textit{fully rational}$, meaning each of them always selects the action that
maximizes her expected utility. Yet many empirical evidence suggests that human
decisions may deviate from this fully rationality assumption. In this work, we
attempt to relax the fully rationality assumption with $\textit{bounded
rationality}$. Specifically, we formulate the bounded rationality of an agent
by adopting the quantal response model (McKelvey and Palfrey, 1995).
  We develop a theory of rationality-robust information design in the canonical
setting of Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011) with binary
receiver action. We first identify conditions under which the optimal signaling
scheme structure for a fully rational receiver remains optimal or approximately
optimal for a boundedly rational receiver. In practice, it might be costly for
the designer to estimate the degree of the receiver's bounded rationality
level. Motivated by this practical consideration, we then study the existence
and construction of $\textit{robust}$ signaling schemes when there is
uncertainty about the receiver's bounded rationality level.

reduced smoking prevalence worldwide. However, the rate of decline of smoking
prevalence is slowing down. Therefore, there is a need for models that capture
the full complexity of the smoking epidemic. These models can then be used as
test-beds to develop new policies to limit the spread of smoking. Current
models of smoking dynamics mainly use ordinary differential equation (ODE)
models, where studying the effect of an individual's contact network is
challenging. They also do not consider all the interactions between individuals
that can lead to changes in smoking behaviour, implying that they do not
consider valuable information on the spread of smoking behaviour.
  In this context, we develop an agent-based model (ABM), calibrate and then
validate it on historical trends observed in the US and UK. Our ABM considers
spontaneous terms, interactions between agents, and the agent's contact
network. To explore the effect of the underlying network on smoking dynamics,
we test the ABM on six different networks, both synthetic and real-world. In
addition, we also compare the ABM with an ODE model. Our results suggest that
the dynamics from the ODE model are similar to the ABM only when the network
structure is fully connected (FC). The FC network performs poorly in
replicating the empirical trends in the data, while the real-world network best
replicates it amongst the six networks. Further, when information on the
real-world network is unavailable, our ABM on Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi
benchmark networks (or networks with a similar average degree as the real-world
network) can be used to model smoking behaviour. These results suggest that
networks are essential for modelling smoking behaviour and that our ABM can be
used to develop network-based intervention strategies and policies for tobacco
control.

Our technique uses Ravenet et al's algorithm which we use to compute the image

base word embedding technique to calculate the final vector representation of
the image schema. Our representation learning technique works by clustering:
word embedding vectors which belong to the same image schema should be
relatively closer to each other, and thus form a cluster.
  With the image schemas representable as vectors, it also becomes possible to
have a notion that some image schemas are closer or more similar to each other
than to the others because the distance between the vectors is a proxy of the
dissimilarity between the corresponding image schemas. Therefore, after
obtaining the vector representation of the image schemas, we calculate the
distances between those vectors. Based on these, we create visualizations to
illustrate the relative distances between the different image schemas.

magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging without constraints on model parameters.
  Theory and Methods: We combine two recently-proposed models in a
Bloch-McConnell equation: the dynamics of the free spin pool is confined to the
hybrid state and the dynamics of the semi-solid spin pool is described by the
generalized Bloch model. We numerically optimize the flip angles and durations
of a train of radio frequency pulses to enhance the encoding of three marked
qMT parameters while accounting for an 8-parameter model. We sparsely sample
each time frame along this spin dynamics with a 3D radial koosh-ball
trajectory, reconstruct the data with sub-space modeling, and fit the qMT model
with a neural network for computational efficiency.
  Results: We were able to extract qMT parameter maps of the whole brain with a
nominal resolution of 1mm isotropic and high SNR from a 12.6 minute scan. In
lesions of multiple sclerosis subjects, we observe a decreased size of the
semi-solid spin pool and slower relaxation, consistent with previous reports.
  Conclusion: The encoding power of the hybrid state, combined with regularized
image reconstruction, and the accuracy of the generalized Bloch model provide
an excellent basis for highly efficient quantitative magnetization transfer
imaging.

curved space-times is discussed under a new geometrical perspective. The phase
space dynamics of the quantum field modes are mapped to curves in a
2-dimensional hyperbolic metric space, in which distances between neighbor
points are shown to be proportional to the Bogoliubov coefficients associated
with their corresponding mode solutions in phase space. The vacuum state for
each mode is then defined as the unique trajectory from which all mapped phase
space solutions move within thin annular regions around it. This property
implies the stability of the vacuum state: solutions evolved from a point in
this trajectory stay close to it as both evolve, and the particle creation is
therefore minimized. The new approach is applied to the well-known cases of the
time-independent dynamics, where the solutions draw circles around this curve,
and when the adiabatic approximation is valid. The analysis is then extended to
time-dependent cases in which the adiabatic approximation is not applicable, in
the super-Hubble or low-frequency regimes. It is shown that stability
trajectories can also be found in these situations, and stable quantum vacua
can be obtained. This new formalism is applied to two situations: de Sitter
space, where the Bunch-Davies vacuum is obtained in a completely different
manner through an analysis in the super-Hubble regime, and in the context of
cosmological bouncing models, in which the contracting phase is dominated by a
cosmological constant in the asymptotic past. A new vacuum state for
cosmological perturbations is proposed in this situation.

nearest-neighbour interactions $J$ and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbour
interactions $J'$ (within the isotropic Heisenberg model) was previously
characterized as a phase with commensurate order. In this paper, we demonstrate
that the system in fact exhibits an incommensurate quantum spin spiral. Even
though the ground state is translationally invariant in terms of the local spin
expectations $\avg{\vec{S}_i}$, the spiral can be detected via the connected
spin-spin correlations
$\avg{\vec{S}_i\cdot\vec{S}_j}-\avg{\vec{S}_i}\cdot\avg{\vec{S}_j}$ between the
apical spins. It has a long wavelength that grows with $J'$ and that soon
exceeds finite-system sizes typically employed in numerical simulations. A
faithful treatment thus requires the use of state-of-the-art simulations for
large, periodic systems.
  In this work, we are able to accurately treat up to $L=400$ sites (200 unit
cells) with periodic boundary conditions using the density-matrix
renormaliztion group (DMRG). Exploiting the SU(2) symmetry allows us to
directly compute the lowest-energy state for a given total spin. Our results

orientation -- a phenomenon important in chemical reaction dynamics, ultrafast
molecular imaging, high harmonics generation, and attosecond science. However,
significant molecular orientation usually requires rotationally cold molecules,
like in rarified molecular beams, because chaotic thermal motion is detrimental
to the orientation process. Here we propose to use the mechanism of the echo
phenomenon previously observed in hadron accelerators, free-electron lasers,
and laser-excited molecules to overcome the destructive thermal effects and
achieve efficient field-free molecular orientation at high temperatures. In our
scheme, a linearly polarized short laser pulse transforms a broad thermal
distribution in the molecular rotational phase space into many separated narrow
filaments due to the nonlinear phase mixing during the post-pulse free
evolution. Molecular subgroups belonging to individual filaments have
much-reduced dispersion of angular velocities. They are rotationally cold, and
a subsequent moderate terahertz (THz) pulse can easily orient them. The overall
enhanced orientation of the molecular gas is achieved with some delay, in the
course of the echo process combining the contributions of different filaments.
Our results demonstrate that the echo-enhanced orientation is an order of
magnitude higher than that of the THz pulse alone. The mechanism is robust --
it applies to different types of molecules, and the degree of orientation is
relatively insensitive to the temperature. The laser and THz pulses used in the
scheme are readily available, allowing quick experimental demonstration and
testing in various applications. Breaking the phase space to individual
filaments to overcome hindering thermal conditions may find a wide range of
applications beyond molecular orientation.

  Repair via Zero-shot Learning","Accepted at ESEC/FSE 2022",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to the promising future of Automated Program Repair (APR), researchers
have proposed various APR techniques, including heuristic-based,
template-based, and constraint-based techniques. Among such classic APR
techniques, template-based techniques have been widely recognized as state of
the art. However, such template-based techniques require predefined templates
to perform repair, and their effectiveness is thus limited. To this end,
researchers leveraged the recent advances in Deep Learning to further improve
APR. Such learning-based techniques view APR as a Neural Machine Translation
problem, using the buggy/fixed code snippets as the source/target languages for
translation. In this way, such techniques heavily rely on large numbers of
high-quality bug-fixing commits, which can be extremely costly and challenging
to construct. Furthermore, the edit variety of these learning-based techniques
are limited to the available bug-fixes within their training datasets.
Therefore, in this paper, we aim to revisit the learning-based APR problem, and
propose AlphaRepair, to leverage zero-shot learning directly using large
pre-trained code models for APR. Our main insight is instead of modeling what a
repair edit should look like, we can directly predict what the correct code is
based on the context information. We have implemented AlphaRepair as a
practical multilingual APR tool based on the recent CodeBERT model. Our results
on the widely used Defects4J benchmark show that AlphaRepair can substantially
outperform state-of-the-art APR tools. We also studied the impact of different
design choices and show that AlphaRepair performs even better on a newer
version of Defects4J (2.0) with 3.3X more fixes than best performing baseline,
indicating that AlphaRepair can potentially avoid the dataset-overfitting issue

This paper investigates the effects of sector-based job prospects on individual
migration decisions across prefecture boundaries. To this end, we created a
proxy variable for job prospects, compiled a unique quasi-panel of 66,427
individuals from 283 cities during 1997--2017, introduced reference-dependence
to the random utility maximisation model of migration in a sequential setting,
derived empirical specifications with theoretical micro-foundations, and
applied various monadic and dyadic fixed effects to address multilateral
resistance to migration. Multilevel logit models and two-step system GMM
estimation were adopted for the robustness check. Our primary findings are that
a 10% increase in the ratio of sector-based job prospects in cities of
destination to cities of origin raises the probability of migration by
1.281--2.185 percentage points, and the effects tend to be stronger when the
scale of the ratio is larger. Having a family migration network causes an
increase of approximately 6 percentage points in migratory probabilities.
Further, labour migrants are more likely to be male, unmarried, younger, or
more educated. Our results suggest that the ongoing industrial reform in China
influences labour mobility between cities, providing important insights for
regional policymakers to prevent brain drain and to attract relevant talent.

addition to the size of the houses, PV-to-roof area ratio is highly dependent

controller, represented as a neural network, using training data that
correspond to a collection of formation tasks and agent parameters. These
parameters and tasks are derived by varying the nominal agent parameters and a
user-defined formation task to be achieved, respectively. In the second step of
the algorithm, each agent incorporates the trained neural network into an

multi-agent closed-loop system satisfies the user-defined formation task. Both
the learning phase and the adaptive control policy are distributed, in the

derived from covariant Wilson renormalisation via Osterwalder-Schrader
reconstruction. As such it directly applies to QFT with a true (physical)
Hamiltonian bounded from below. The validity of the scheme was positively
tested for free QFT in any dimension with or without Abelian gauge symmetries
of Yang-Mills type.
  The aim of this Hamiltonian renormalisation scheme is to remove quantisation
ambiguities of Hamiltonians in interacting QFT that remain even after UV and IR
regulators are removed as it happens in highly non-linear QFT such as quantum
gravity. While not derived for that case, the renormalisation flow formulae can
without change also be applied to QFT without a single true Hamiltonian but
rather an infinite number of Hamiltonian constraints. Then a central question
is how the constraint algebra reacts to the renormalisation flow.
  This question should ultimately be addressed in quantum gravity. Before one
considers this interacting, constrained QFT it is well motivated to consider a
free, constrained QFT where the fixed point is explicitly known. In this paper
we therefore address the case of parametrised field theory for which the
quantum constraint algebra coincides simultaneously with the hypersurface
deformation algebra of quantum gravity (or any other generally covariant
theory) and the Virasoro algebra of free, closed, bosonic string theory or
other CFT to which the results of this paper apply verbatim.
  The central result of our investigation is that finite resolution
(discretised) constraint algebras {\it must not close} and that anomaly

regularise the theory at finite UV and IR cut-off. Then one first removes the
UV cutoff using renormalisation techniques applied to families of CQFT's
labelled by finite UV resolutions and then takes the thermodynamic limit.
Alternatively, one may try to work directly without IR cut-off.
  More recently, wavelets have been proposed to define the renormalisation flow
of CQFT's which is natural as they come accompanied with a multi-resolution
analysis (MRA). However, wavelets so far have been mostly studied in the
non-compact case. Practically useful wavelets that display compact support and
some degree of smoothness can be constructed on the real line using Fourier
space techniques but explicit formulae as functions of position are rarely
available. Compactly supported wavelets can be periodised by summing over
period translates keeping orthogonality properties but still yield to rather
complicated expressions which generically lose their smoothness and position
locality properties.
  It transpires that a direct approach to wavelets in the compact case is
desirable. In this contribution we show that the Dirichlet-Shannon kernels
serve as a natural scaling function to define generalised orthonormal wavelet
bases on tori or copies of real lines respectively. These generalised wavelets
are smooth, are simple explicitly computable functions, display quasi-local
properties close to the Haar wavelet and have compact momentum supprt.
Accordingly they have a built-in cut-off both in position and momentum, making
them very useful for renormalisation applications.

  representations and density weights in quantum gravity","27p, no figures",,,,"gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A basic assumption in classical GR is that the metric field is nowhere
degenerate in spacetime. In particular the induced metric on Cauchy surfaces
must be nowhere degenerate. It is only under this assumption that one can
derive the hypersurace deformation algebra between the initial value
constraints which is absolutely transparent from the fact that the {\it
inverse} of the induced metric is needed to close the algebra. This statement
is independent of the density weight that one may want to equip the spatial
metric with. Accordingly, the very definition of a non-anomalous representation
of the hypersurface defomation algebra in quantum gravity has to address the
issue of non-degenracy of the induced metric that is needed in the classical
theory. In the Hilbert space representation employed in Loop Quantum Gravity
(LQG) most emphasis has been layed to define an inverse metric operator on the
dense domain of spin network states although they represent induced quantum
geometries which are degenerate almost everywhere. It is no surprise that
demonstration of closure of the constraint algebra on this domain meets
difficulties because it is a sector of the quantum theory which is classically
forbidden and which lies outside the domain of definition of the classical
hypersurface deformation algebra. Various suggestions for addressing the issue
such as non-standard operator topologies, dual spaces (habitats) and density
weights have been propposed to address this issue with respect to the quantum
dynamics of LQG. In this article we summarise these developments and argue that
insisting on a dense domain of non-degenerate states within the LQG
representation may provide a natural resolution of the issue thereby possibly
avoiding the above mentioned non-standard constructions.

that shares many features of Lorentzian general relativity. In particular, it
displays a non-trivial realisation of the hypersurface deformation algebroid
with non-trivial, i.e. phase space dependent structure functions rather than
structure constants.
  In this paper we show that the model admits {\it an exact quantisation}. The
quantisation rests on the observation that for this model and in the chosen
representation of the canonical commutation relations the density unity
hypersurface algebra {\it can be exponentiated on non-degenerate states}. These
are states that represent a non-degenerate quantum metric and from a classical
perspective are the relevant states on which the hypersurface algebra is
representable.
  The representation of the algebra is exact, with no ambiguities involved and
anomaly free. The quantum constraints can be exactly solved using {\it groupoid
averaging} and the solutions admit a Hilbert space structure that agrees with
the quantisation of a recently found reduced phase space formulation. Using the
also recently found covariant action for that model, we start a path integral
or spin foam formulation which, due to the Abelian character of the gauge
group, is much simpler than for Lorentzian signature general relativity and
provides an ideal testing ground for general spin foam models.

a so-called shrunk subspace, which acts as a dual certificate for the value of
the noncommutative rank. In particular, the operator Sinkhorn algorithm,
perhaps the simplest algorithm to compute the noncommutative rank with operator
scaling, does not find a shrunk subspace. Finding a shrunk subspace plays a key
role in applications, such as separation in the Brascamp-Lieb polytope,
one-parameter subgroups in the null-cone membership problem, and primal-dual
algorithms for matroid intersection and fractional matroid matching.
  In this paper, we provide a simple Sinkhorn-style algorithm to find the
smallest shrunk subspace over the complex field in deterministic polynomial

problem, where the spectra of the marginals must be majorized by specified
vectors. Then we design an efficient Sinkhorn-style algorithm for the
generalized operator scaling problem. Applying this to the shrunk subspace
problem, we show that a sufficiently long run of the algorithm also finds an
approximate shrunk subspace close to the minimum exact shrunk subspace.
Finally, we show that the approximate shrunk subspace can be rounded if it is
sufficiently close. Along the way, we also provide a simple randomized

of industrial products. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on
encoder-decoder architecture have achieved tremendous success in various defect
detection tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution, they
commonly exhibit a limitation in explicitly modeling long-range interactions,
critical for pixel-wise defect detection in complex cases, e.g., cluttered
background and illegible pseudo-defects. Recent transformers are especially
skilled at learning global image dependencies but with limited local structural
information necessary for detailed defect location. To overcome the above
limitations, we propose an efficient hybrid transformer architecture, termed
Defect Transformer (DefT), for surface defect detection, which incorporates CNN
and transformer into a unified model to capture local and non-local
relationships collaboratively. Specifically, in the encoder module, a
convolutional stem block is firstly adopted to retain more detailed spatial
information. Then, the patch aggregation blocks are used to generate
multi-scale representation with four hierarchies, each of them is followed by a
series of DefT blocks, which respectively include a locally position-aware
block for local position encoding, a lightweight multi-pooling self-attention
to model multi-scale global contextual relationships with good computational
efficiency, and a convolutional feed-forward network for feature transformation
and further location information learning. Finally, a simple but effective
decoder module is proposed to gradually recover spatial details from the skip
connections in the encoder. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method compared with other CNN- and
transformer-based networks.

extracted per volume via height projection and connected component analysis.
(2) Height maps are compared and intersected with the object map to produce a
2D change location mask for changed object candidates in the source scene. (3)
3D geometric validation is performed using SDF-derived features per object
candidate for change mask refinement. We evaluate our approach on both

modeling assumptions; however, finding the optimal transformation is
challenging and results may vary with the choice of transformation. When a
continuous response variable is measured repeatedly for a subject or the
continuous responses arise from clusters, it is more challenging to model the
continuous response data due to correlation within clusters. We extend a widely
used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM), to fit
clustered continuous response variables based on generalized estimating
equation (GEE) methods for ordinal responses. With our approach, estimates of
marginal parameters, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), expectations,
and quantiles conditional on covariates can be obtained without
pre-transformation of the potentially skewed continuous response data.
Computational challenges arise with large numbers of distinct values of the
continuous response variable, and we propose two feasible and computationally
efficient approaches to fit CPMs for clustered continuous response variables
with different working correlation structures. We study finite sample operating
characteristics of the estimators via simulation, and illustrate their
implementation with two data examples. One studies predictors of CD4:CD8 ratios
in an HIV study. The other uses data from The Lung Health Study to investigate
the contribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism to lung function decline.

To mitigate the effects of DoS attacks, a novel dynamic quantization with

areas. However, the concerns that they can be biased against specific
demographic groups hinder their adoption in high-stake applications. Thus, it
is essential to ensure fairness in machine learning models. Most previous
efforts require direct access to sensitive attributes for mitigating bias.
Nonetheless, it is often infeasible to obtain large-scale users' sensitive
attributes considering users' concerns about privacy in the data collection
process. Privacy mechanisms such as local differential privacy (LDP) are widely
enforced on sensitive information in the data collection stage due to legal
compliance and people's increasing awareness of privacy. Therefore, a critical
problem is how to make fair predictions under privacy. We study a novel and
practical problem of fair classification in a semi-private setting, where most
of the sensitive attributes are private and only a small amount of clean ones
are available. To this end, we propose a novel framework FairSP that can
achieve Fair prediction under the Semi-Private setting. First, FairSP learns to
correct the noise-protected sensitive attributes by exploiting the limited
clean sensitive attributes. Then, it jointly models the corrected and clean
data in an adversarial way for debiasing and prediction. Theoretical analysis
shows that the proposed model can ensure fairness under mild assumptions in the
semi-private setting. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for making fair predictions under
privacy and maintaining high accuracy.

external detuning produces unconventional phases and phase transitions. As the
Rydberg blockade radius increases, the phase transition between disordered and
density-wave ordered phases changes from the standard Potts universality class
to an unconventional chiral one. As the radius increases further (above Potts
point but still close to the tip of the lobe), a very narrow intermediate
floating-phase region begins to appear. A concise physical picture is also
provided to illustrate the numerical results. Compared with previous studies,
this work brings more evidence for commensurate-incommensurate quantum phase
transitions in programmable quantum simulators from the perspective of quantum

  accepted version",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Depinning of elastic systems advancing on disordered media can usually be
described by the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation (qEW). However, additional
ingredients such as anharmonicity and forces that can not be derived from a
potential energy may generate a different scaling behavior at depinning. The
most experimentally relevant is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) term,
proportional to the square of the slope at each site, which drives the critical
behavior into the so-called quenched KPZ (qKPZ) universality class. We study
this universality class both numerically and analytically: by using exact
mappings we show that at least for $d=1,2$ this class encompasses not only the
qKPZ equation itself, but also anharmonic depinning and a well-known class of
cellular automata introduced by Tang and Leschhorn. We develop scaling
arguments for all critical exponents, including size and duration of
avalanches. The scale is set by the confining potential strength $m^2$. This
allows us to estimate numerically these exponents as well as the $m$-dependent
effective force correlator $\Delta(w)$, and its correlation length $\rho:=
\Delta(0)/|\Delta'(0^+)|$. Finally we present a new algorithm to numerically
estimate the effective ($m$-dependent) elasticity $c$, and the effective KPZ
non-linearity $\lambda$. This allows us to define a dimensionless universal KPZ
amplitude ${\cal A}:=\rho \lambda /c$, which takes the value ${\cal A}=1.10(2)$
in all systems considered in $d=1$. This proves that qKPZ is the effective
field theory for all these models. Our work paves the way for a deeper
understanding of depinning in the qKPZ class, and in particular, for the
construction of a field theory that we describe in a companion paper.

settings where only the optimal value function is assumed to be
linearly-realizable. It has recently been understood that, even under this
seemingly strong assumption and access to a generative model, worst-case sample
complexities can be prohibitively (i.e., exponentially) large. We investigate
the setting where the learner additionally has access to interactive
demonstrations from an expert policy, and we present a statistically and
computationally efficient algorithm (Delphi) for blending exploration with
expert queries. In particular, Delphi requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ expert
queries and a $\texttt{poly}(d,H,|\mathcal{A}|,1/\varepsilon)$ amount of
exploratory samples to provably recover an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal policy.
Compared to pure RL approaches, this corresponds to an exponential improvement
in sample complexity with surprisingly-little expert input. Compared to prior
imitation learning (IL) approaches, our required number of expert
demonstrations is independent of $H$ and logarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$,
whereas all prior work required at least linear factors of both in addition to
the same dependence on $d$. Towards establishing the minimal amount of expert
queries needed, we show that, in the same setting, any learner whose
exploration budget is polynomially-bounded (in terms of $d,H,$ and
$|\mathcal{A}|$) will require at least $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ oracle calls to
recover a policy competing with the expert's value function. Under the weaker
assumption that the expert's policy is linear, we show that the lower bound
increases to $\tilde\Omega(d)$.

  Enhancement","Accepted by ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image-adaptive lookup tables (LUTs) have achieved great success in real-time
image enhancement tasks due to their high efficiency for modeling color
transforms. However, they embed the complete transform, including the color
component-independent and the component-correlated parts, into only a single
type of LUTs, either 1D or 3D, in a coupled manner. This scheme raises a
dilemma of improving model expressiveness or efficiency due to two factors. On
the one hand, the 1D LUTs provide high computational efficiency but lack the
critical capability of color components interaction. On the other, the 3D LUTs
present enhanced component-correlated transform capability but suffer from
heavy memory footprint, high training difficulty, and limited cell utilization.
Inspired by the conventional divide-and-conquer practice in the image signal
processor, we present SepLUT (separable image-adaptive lookup table) to tackle
the above limitations. Specifically, we separate a single color transform into
a cascade of component-independent and component-correlated sub-transforms
instantiated as 1D and 3D LUTs, respectively. In this way, the capabilities of
two sub-transforms can facilitate each other, where the 3D LUT complements the
ability to mix up color components, and the 1D LUT redistributes the input
colors to increase the cell utilization of the 3D LUT and thus enable the use
of a more lightweight 3D LUT. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
presents enhanced performance on photo retouching benchmark datasets than the
current state-of-the-art and achieves real-time processing on both GPUs and
CPUs.

generic ``single-clock"" systems in anisotropic spacetimes -- which are not

identify fixed points in the resulting phase space. We identify regions of this
phase space that flow to isotropic fixed points -- including a de Sitter fixed

sources that do not obey the energy conditions required for Wald's theorem.
Such flows into de Sitter reveal the emergence of an effective cosmological

cumbersome network (teacher) to a compact network (student), has demonstrated
its advantages in some computer vision applications. The representation of
knowledge is vital for knowledge transferring and student learning, which is
generally defined in hand-crafted manners or uses the intermediate features
directly. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic meta knowledge
distillation method under the teacher-student architecture for the single image
super-resolution task. It provides a more flexible and accurate way to help the
teachers transmit knowledge in accordance with the abilities of students via
knowledge representation networks (KRNets) with learnable parameters. In order
to improve the perception ability of knowledge representation to students'
requirements, we propose to solve the transformation process from intermediate
outputs to transferred knowledge by employing the student features and the
correlation between teacher and student in the KRNets. Specifically, the
texture-aware dynamic kernels are generated and then extract texture features
to be improved and the corresponding teacher guidance so as to decompose the
distillation problem into texture-wise supervision for further promoting the
recovery quality of high-frequency details. In addition, the KRNets are
optimized in a meta-learning manner to ensure the knowledge transferring and
the student learning are beneficial to improving the reconstructed quality of
the student. Experiments conducted on various single image super-resolution
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing defined
knowledge representation related distillation methods, and can help
super-resolution algorithms achieve better reconstruction quality without
introducing any inference complexity.

variety of quantum emitters with properties suitable for a broad range of
quantum photonic applications. Among them, the negatively charged boron vacancy
(VB-) defect with optically addressable spin states has emerged recently due to
its potential use in quantum sensing. Compared to spin defects in bulk
crystals, VB- preserves its spin coherence properties when placed at
nanometer-scale distances from the hBN surface, enabling nanometer-scale
quantum sensing. On the other hand, the low quantum efficiency of VB- has
hindered its use in practical applications. Several studies have reported
improving the overall quantum efficiency of VB- defects using plasmonic
effects; however, the overall enhancements of up to 17 times reported to date
are relatively modest. In this study, we explore and demonstrate much higher
emission enhancements of VB- with ultralow-loss nano-patch antenna (NPA)
structures. An overall intensity enhancement of up to 250 times is observed for
NPA-coupled VB- defects. Since the laser spot exceeds the area of the NPA,
where the enhancement occurs, the actual enhancement provided by the NPA is
calculated to be ~1685 times, representing a significant increase over the
previously reported results. Importantly, the optically detected magnetic
resonance (ODMR) contrast is preserved at such exceptionally strong
enhancement. Our results not only establish NPA-coupled VB- defects as
high-resolution magnetic field sensors operating at weak laser powers, but also
provide a promising approach to obtaining single VB- defects.

Causal inference techniques enable qualitative and quantitative root cause
analysis of performance downgrade. Nevertheless, causality analysis is
practically challenging, particularly due to limited observability. Recently,
chaos engineering has been applied to test complex real-world software systems.
Chaos frameworks like Chaos Mesh mutate a set of chaos variables to inject
catastrophic events (e.g., network slowdowns) to ""stress"" software systems. The
systems under chaos stress are then tested using methods like differential
testing to check if they retain their normal functionality (e.g., SQL query
output is always correct under stress). Despite its ubiquity in the industry,
chaos engineering is now employed mostly to aid software testing rather for
performance debugging.
  This paper identifies novel usage of chaos engineering on helping developers
diagnose performance anomalies in databases. Our presented framework, PERFCE,
comprises an offline phase and an online phase. The offline phase learns the
statistical models of the target database system, whilst the online phase
diagnoses the root cause of monitored performance anomalies on the fly. During
the offline phase, PERFCE leverages both passive observations and proactive
chaos experiments to constitute accurate causal graphs and structural equation
models (SEMs). When observing performance anomalies during the online phase,
causal graphs enable qualitative root cause identification (e.g., high CPU
usage) and SEMs enable quantitative counterfactual analysis (e.g., determining
""when CPU usage is reduced to 45\%, performance returns to normal""). PERFCE
notably outperforms prior works on common synthetic datasets, and our

underlying hierarchical electric power system operations and planning as the
hidden roadblocks on the way to decarbonization. We suggest that these can be
overcome by enhancing today's information exchange and control. This can be
done by revealing and utilising inherent structure-preserving features of
complex physical systems, and, based on this, by establishing multi-layered
energy modeling. Each module (component, control area, non-utility-owned
entities) can be characterized in terms of its interaction variable, and higher
level models can be used to understand the interaction dynamics between
different modules. Once the structure is understood, we propose nonlinear
energy control for these modules which supports feed-forward self-adaptation to
ensure feasible interconnected system. Based on these technology agnostic
structures it becomes possible to expand today's Balancing Authorities (BA) to
multi-layered interactive intelligent Balancing Authorities (iBAs) and to
introduce protocols for flexible utilization of diverse technologies over broad
ranges of temporal and spatial conditions.

electrons can travel with zero resistance along one-dimensional conducting
paths known as chiral edge channels (CECs). These CECs have been predicted to
be confined to the one-dimensional (1D) edges and exponentially decay in the
two-dimensional (2D) bulk. In this work, we present the results of a systematic
study of QAH devices fashioned in a Hall bar geometry of different widths. At
the charge neutral point, the QAH effect persists in a Hall bar device with a
width of only ~72 nm, implying the intrinsic decaying length of CECs is less
than ~36 nm. In the electron-doped regime, we find that the Hall resistance
deviates quickly from the quantized value when the sample width is less than 1
um. Our theoretical calculations suggest that the deviation from the quantized
Hall resistance in narrow QAH samples originates from the interaction between
two opposite CECs mediated by disorder-induced bulk states in QAH insulators,
consistent with our experimental observations.

limited precision in controlling the track shifts, that in turn affects the
reliability of reading and writing the data. A current proposal for combating
deletions in racetrack memories is to use redundant heads per-track resulting
in multiple copies (potentially erroneous) and recovering the data by solving a
specialized version of a sequence reconstruction problem. Using this approach,
$k$-deletion correcting codes of length $n$, with $d \ge 2$ heads per-track,
with redundancy $\log \log n + 4$ were constructed. However, the known approach
requires that $k \le d$, namely, that the number of heads ($d$) is larger than
or equal to the number of correctable deletions ($k$). Here we address the
question: What is the best redundancy that can be achieved for a $k$-deletion
code ($k$ is a constant) if the number of heads is fixed at $d$ (due to
implementation constraints)? One of our key results is an answer to this
question, namely, we construct codes that can correct $k$ deletions, for any
$k$ beyond the known limit of $d$. The code has $4k \log \log n+o(\log \log n)$
redundancy for $k \le 2d-1$. In addition, when $k \ge 2d$, our codes have $2
\lfloor k/d\rfloor \log n+o(\log n)$ redundancy, that we prove it is order-wise
optimal, specifically, we prove that the redundancy required for correcting $k$
deletions is at least $\lfloor k/d\rfloor \log n+o(\log n)$. The
encoding/decoding complexity of our codes is $O(n\log^{2k}n)$. Finally, we ask
a general question: What is the optimal redundancy for codes correcting a
combination of at most $k$ deletions and insertions in a $d$-head racetrack
memory? We prove that the redundancy sufficient to correct a combination of $k$
deletion and insertion errors is similar to the case of $k$ deletion errors.

on whether Internet users perceive a fake news article/snippet to be legitimate
after reading it. In this paper, we attempt to garner an in-depth understanding
of users' susceptibility to text-centric fake news attacks via a
neuro-cognitive methodology. We investigate the neural underpinnings relevant
to fake/real news through EEG. We run an experiment with human users to pursue
a thorough investigation of users' perception and cognitive processing of
fake/real news. We analyze the neural activity associated with the fake/real
news detection task for different categories of news articles. Our results show
there may be no statistically significant or automatically inferable
differences in the way the human brain processes the fake vs. real news, while
marked differences are observed when people are subject to (real/fake) news vs.
resting state and even between some different categories of fake news. This
neuro-cognitive finding may help to justify users' susceptibility to fake news
attacks, as also confirmed from the behavioral analysis. In other words, the
fake news articles may seem almost indistinguishable from the real news
articles in both behavioral and neural domains. Our work serves to dissect the
fundamental neural phenomena underlying fake news attacks and explains users'
susceptibility to these attacks through the limits of human biology. We believe
this could be a notable insight for the researchers and practitioners

closed-form solutions is achieved to be employed as the decision layer for GCN.

the evolution of the surface state via electrical and thermoelectric transport

parameter that suppresses the Kondo gap and increases the valence of Sm from

reveal that the surface carrier density increases with increasing pressure,

proposed method is that all areas share the common latent distributions and the
potential area-wise heterogeneity is captured by the mixing proportions that

resolution is limited by the wavelength of the light source, which cannot be
infinitely reduced. Magically, this limitation can be circumvented by using an
entangled multiphoton source because interference produced by an N-photon
amplitude features a reduced de Broglie wavelength {\lambda}/N. However, the
extremely low efficiency in multiphoton state generation and coincidence counts
actually negates the potential of using multiphoton states in practical
measurements. Here, we demonstrate a novel interferometric technique based on
structured nonlinear optics, i.e., parametric upconversion of a structured
beam, capable of superresolution measurement in real time. The main principle
relies in that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) state and associated
intramodal phase within the structured beam are both continuously multiplied in
cascading upconversion to mimic the superresolved phase evolution of a
multiphoton amplitude. Owing to the use of bright sensing beams and OAM mode
projection, up to a 12-photon de Broglie wavelength with almost perfect
visibility is observed in real time and, importantly, by using only a low-cost
detector. Our results open the door to real-time superresolution

calculates the ranking score of candidate proposals upon subject, location and

appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not
sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is
first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human
semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module
(HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the
visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is
also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the
cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on
the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly,
these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly
outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted
for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this
method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and
PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.

differential equation under the combined influence of fast periodic sampling
with period $\delta$ and small jump noise of size $\varepsilon, 0<
\varepsilon,\delta \ll 1.$ The noise is a combination of Brownian motion and
Poisson random measure. The instantaneous rate of change of the state depends
not only on its current value \textit{but} on the most recent measurement of
the state, as the state is measured at certain discrete-time instants. As
$\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0,$ the stochastic process of interest converges,
in a suitable sense, to the dynamics of the deterministic equation. The study
of rescaled fluctuations of the stochastic process around its mean is found to
vary depending on the relative rates of convergence of small parameters
$\varepsilon, \delta$ in different asymptotic regimes. We show that the
rescaled process converges, in a strong (path-wise) sense, to an effective
process having an extra drift term capturing both the sampling and noise

stochastic process of interest, in terms of the effective process along with

high-dimensional imaging settings. GLEAM splits the end-to-end network into
decoupled network modules. Each module is optimized in a greedy manner with
decoupled gradient updates, reducing the memory footprint during training. We
show that the decoupled gradient updates can be performed in parallel on

readout pulse width, readout pulse energy, resonator design, qubit design,

thus important to model and predict the fidelity based on various design
parameters along the readout path. In this work, a simulation methodology for
superconducting qubit readout fidelity is proposed and implemented using Matlab
and Ansys HFSS to allow the co-optimization in the readout path. As an example,
parameters are taken from an actual superconducting-qubit-based quantum
computer and the simulation is calibrated to one experimental point. It is then
used to predict the readout error of the system as a function of readout pulse
width and power and the results match the experiment well. It is found that the

evolution of multiband light/color curves of SN 2021hpr is similar to that of
normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the exception of some phases,
especially a plateau phase that appeared in the $V-R$ color curve before peak
luminosity, which resembles that of SN 2017cbv. The first spectrum we observed
at t $\sim -$14.4 days shows a higher velocity for the Si II $\lambda$6355
feature ($\sim$ 21,000 km s$^{-1}$) than that of other normal Velocity (NV) SNe
Ia at the same phase. Based on the Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity of $\sim$
12,420 km s$^{-1}$ around the maximum light, we deduce that SN 2021hpr is a
transitional object between high velocity (HV) and NV SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the Si
II $\lambda$6355 feature shows a high velocity gradient (HVG) of about 800 km
s$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ from roughly $-$14.37 to $-$4.31 days relative to the
$B$-band maximum, which indicates that SN 2021hpr can also be classified as an
HVG SN Ia. The evolution of SN 2021hpr is similar to that of SN 2011fe.
Including SN 2021hpr, there have been six supernovae observed in the host
galaxy NGC 3147, and the supernovae explosion rate in the last 50 yr is
slightly higher for SNe Ia, while lower for SNe Ibc and SNe II it is lower than
expected rate from the radio data. Inspecting the spectra, we find that SN
2021hpr has a metal-rich (12 + log(O/H) $\approx$ 8.648) circumstellar
environment, where HV SNe tend to reside. Based on the decline rate of SN
2021hpr in the $B$ band, we determine the distance modulus of the host galaxy
NGC 3147 using the Phillips relation to be 33.46 $\pm$ 0.21 mag, which is close
to that found by previous works.

first detection of a molecular outflow in the Small Magellanic Cloud with 0.2

a spatial resolution of 0.1 pc toward the massive protostar Y246. The bipolar
outflow is nicely illustrated by high-velocity wings of CO(3-2) emission at

the light ring and the null circular orbit, in a generic black hole background.
However, for the equatorial timelike circular orbit, quite different from the
light ring case, its radius is closely dependent of the energy and angular
momentum of a test particle. This fact seems to restrict the extension of the
topological treatment to the timelike circular orbit. In this paper, we confirm
that the angular momentum does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the
constructed vector with its zero points denoting the equatorial timelike
circular orbits. As a result, a well-behaved topology to characterize the
equatorial timelike circular orbits can be constructed. Our study shows that
the total topological number of the timelike circular orbits vanishes for a
generic black hole, which is dependent of the energy of the particle.
Significantly, it reveals that if there the timelike circular orbits exist,
they always come in pairs for fixed angular momentum. Meanwhile, the stable and
unstable timelike circular orbits have positive or negative winding number. Of
particular interest is that the marginally stable circular orbit corresponds to
the bifurcation point of the zero point of the constructed vector. Moreover, we
also examine the case when the particle energy acts as the control parameter.
It is shown that there will be topological phase transition when the value of
the particle energy is one. Below this value, the timelike circular orbits
always come in pairs for fixed energy. Otherwise, we will have one more
unstable timelike circular orbit. We further apply the treatment to the Kerr
black hole. All the results given in a generic black hole background are
exactly reproduced. These strongly indicate that our topological approach can
be generalized to the equatorial timelike circular orbits.

using Bayesian optimization (BO) over sequence pairs. BO is a machine learning
technique that uses a probabilistic surrogate model and an acquisition function
that balances exploration and exploitation to efficiently optimize a black-box

therefore can be used with more realistic objectives. Additionally, the ability
to learn from data and adapt the algorithm to the objective function makes BO
an appealing alternative to other black-box optimization methods such as
simulated annealing, which relies on problem-dependent heuristics and

used in this work the recently introduced one-parameter correlation factor [E.
Giner, J. Chem. Phys., 154, 084119 (2021)], the theory presented here is valid
for any correlation factor. Thanks to the formalization of the non Hermitian TC
eigenvalue problem as a search of stationary points for a specific functional
depending both on left-and right-functions, we obtain a general framework
allowing different choices for both the selection criterion in SCI and the
second order perturbative correction to the energy. After numerical
investigations on different second-row atomic and molecular systems in
increasingly large basis sets, we found that taking into account the non
Hermitian character of the TC Hamiltonian in the selection criterion is
mandatory to obtain a fast convergence of the TC energy. Also, selection
criteria based on either the first order coefficient or the second order energy
lead to significantly different convergence rates, which is typically not the
case in the usual Hermitian SCI. Regarding the convergence of the total second
order perturbation energy, we find that the quality of the left-function used
in the equations strongly affects the quality of the results. Within the
near-optimal algorithm proposed here we find that the SCI expansion in the TC
framework converges faster than the usual SCI both in terms of basis set and

occluded area in an all-in-focus image. Inspired by the learnable 3D scene
representation, Multiplane Image (MPI), we attempt to address the partial
occlusion by introducing a novel MPI-based high-resolution bokeh rendering
framework, termed MPIB. To this end, we first present an analysis on how to
apply the MPI representation to bokeh rendering. Based on this analysis, we
propose an MPI representation module combined with a background inpainting
module to implement high-resolution scene representation. This representation
can then be reused to render various bokeh effects according to the controlling
parameters. To train and test our model, we also design a ray-tracing-based
bokeh generator for data generation. Extensive experiments on synthesized and
real-world images validate the effectiveness and flexibility of this framework.

investigated recently with direct numerical simulations (DNS) but experimental

of fully turbulent flows of a yield stress fluid in a rectangular aspect ratio
channel with a high-resolution laser doppler velocimetry (LDA) setup. We employ
aqueous Carbopol solutions, often considered to be a simple yield stress fluid.
We formulate different concentrations to address the effect of the rheology of
the fluid on the turbulence statistics at an approximately constant Reynolds
number. Additionally, we also perform experiments with a single Carbopol
formulation at different Reynolds numbers to study its effect. The flow
analysis is performed via rheology measurements, turbulence statistics and
power spectral densities of velocity fluctuations. The addition of Carbopol to
the flow increases turbulence anisotropy, with an enhancement of streamwise
velocity fluctuations and a decrease in wall normal velocity fluctuations in
comparison to water at the same mean velocity. This change is reflected on the
power spectral densities of streamwise velocity fluctuations, where we observe
a large increase in energy of large scale turbulent structures. Conversely, the
energy of smaller scales is decreased in comparison to water, where the energy
drops with a steeper scale than the Newtonian power law of $k_x^{-5/3}$. As we
increase the Reynolds number with a Carbopol solution, the streamwise Reynolds
stresses approach Newtonian values in the core, which suggests diminishing
effects of shear-thinning. The power spectral densities reveal that the energy
content at larger scales decreases slightly with the Reynolds number. However,
the shear thinning effects do not disappear even as the Reynolds number
approaches 50000.

divergences between arbitrary Borel probability measures on a complete,

close the gap between fine-tuning and prompt-based methods without introducing

similarity across tissues and bones. These correlations are reflected in
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans as a result of close-range proton

data are undersampled which causes global aliasing artifacts. Convolutional
neural network (CNN) models are widely utilized for accelerated MRI
reconstruction, but those models are limited in capturing global correlations
due to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. The
self-attention-based transformer models are capable of capturing global
correlations among image features, however, the current contributions of
transformer models for MRI reconstruction are minute. The existing
contributions mostly provide CNN-transformer hybrid solutions and rarely
leverage the physics of MRI. In this paper, we propose a physics-based

Cascaded Swin Transformers (McSTRA) for accelerated MRI reconstruction. McSTRA
combines several interconnected MRI physics-related concepts with the

self-attention mechanism; it extracts MR features belonging to different
spectral components separately using a multi-head setup; it iterates between
intermediate de-aliasing and k-space correction via a cascaded network with
data consistency in k-space and intermediate loss computations; furthermore, we
propose a novel positional embedding generation mechanism to guide

single constant delay using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem. This approach has
been widely used in the literature and numerous sufficient conditions of
stability have been proposed and expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMI).
The main criticism of the method that is often pointed out is that these LMI
conditions are only sufficient, and there is a lack of information regarding
the reduction of the conservatism. Recently, scalable methods have been
investigated using Bessel-Legendre inequality or orthogonal polynomial-based
inequalities. The interest of these methods relies on their hierarchical
structure with a guarantee of reduction of the level of conservatism. However,
the convergence is still an open question that will be answered for the first
time in this paper. The objective is to prove that the stability of a
time-delay system implies the feasibility of these scalable LMI, at a
sufficiently large order of the Legendre polynomials. Moreover, the proposed
contribution is even able to provide an analytic estimation of this order,
giving rise to a necessary and sufficient LMI for the stability of time-delay
systems.

weighted average over the counterparts on each layer, unless the transition
probabilities between layers vanish. However, they are approximately equal when
the transition probabilities between layers are very small, which is given by
the first-order degenerate perturbation theory. Moreover, we compute the mean
first passage time (MFPT) and the graph MFPT (GrMFPT) that is the average of
the MFPT over all pairs of distinct nodes. Interestingly, we find that the
GrMFPT can be smaller than that of any layer taken in isolation. The result

corresponding to spectral (neutral) stability that the suspensions experiences
a mixing phenomenon similar to Landau damping and we provide optimal pointwise
in time decay rates in weak topology. Further, we show (ii) in the case of
small rotational diffusion \(\nu\) that the mixing estimates persist up to time
scale \(\nu^{-1/2}\) until the exponential decay at enhanced dissipation rate

variable of kinetic models is replaced by an orientation variable on the

decay for macroscopic quantities. For the proof, we start with a general
pointwise decay results for Volterra equations that may be of independent
interest. While, in the non-diffusive case, explicit formulas on the sphere
allow to conclude the desired decay, much more work is required in the
diffusive case: here we prove mixing estimates for the advection-diffusion
equation on the sphere by combining an optimized hypocoercive approach with the

Dirac cone of an AHE material by adding trigonal warping terms to the Dirac
Hamiltonian. We calculate the linear optical conductivity semi-analytically to
show how by breaking the rotational symmetry we can obtain a topologically
distinct phase. The addition of trigonal warping terms causes the emergence of
additional Dirac cones, which when combined has a total Chern number of $\mp 1$
instead of $\pm 1/2$. This results in drastic changes in the anomalous Hall and
longitudinal conductivity. The trigonal warping terms also activates the higher
order Hall responses which does not exist in a $\mathcal{R}$ symmetric
conventional Dirac material. We found the presence of a non-zero second order
Hall current even in the absence of Berry curvature dipole. This shift current
is also unaffected by the chirality of the Dirac cone, which should lead to a
non-zero Hall current in time reversal symmetric systems.

Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem is formulated for each cluster to
select an optimal subset of views that guarantees both visibility and
matchability. Finally, local point clouds for each cluster are separately
computed and merged. Since clustering is independent from pairwise visibility
information, the proposed algorithm runs faster than existing literature and
allows for a massive parallelization. Extensive testing on urban data are
discussed to show the effectiveness and the scalability of this approach.

exploit them in applications, it is important to have a proper way to tune and
manipulate these domain walls. One possible means is through magnetoelastic
coupling. The involvement of rare earth in the lately proposed $R$Al$X$
($R$=rare earth, $X$=Si and Ge) family magnetic Weyl semimetals may provide
such a platform. Here we present transport and thermodynamic properties of
CeAlGe under hydrostatic pressure. We find that pressure enhances the
antiferromagnetic exchange in CeAlGe but essentially retains its magnetic
structure. Large topological Hall effect with pronounced loop shape is observed
within the magnetically ordered state, and it splits into two regions under
pressure. Such an unusual electromagnetic response is inferred to be a
consequence of chiral magnetic domain walls. The unprecedented concomitance of
its evolution under pressure and the reentrance of antiferromagnetic order
strongly suggest the capability of switching on/off this electromagnetic

of a cancer cell's viability, cell division, and death. Assay protocols created
to see if the molecular structures of the drugs being tested have the desired
inhibition qualities often show great variability across experiments, and it is
imperative to diminish the effects of such variability while inferences are
drawn. In this paper we propose the study of experimental data through the
lenses of a mathematical model depicting the inhibition mechanism and the
activation-inhibition dynamics. The method is exemplified through assay data
obtained from the study of inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 activation axis for
the melanoma cells. To mitigate the effects of the variability of the data on
the cell viability measurement, the cell viability is theoretically constructed
as a function of time depending on several parameters. The values of these
parameters are estimated by using the experimental data. Deriving approximation
for the cell viability in a theoretically pre-determined form has the
advantages of (i) being less sensitive to data variability (ii) the estimated
values of the parameters are interpreted directly in the biological processes,
(iii) the amount of variability explained via the approximation validates the
quality of the model, (iv) with the data integrated into the model one can
derive a more complete view over the whole process. These advantages are
demonstrated in the step-by-step implementation of the outlined approach.

Since the communication network is carried out through the internet and there

these constraints are time delay and packet loss. These network limitations can
degrade the performance and even destabilize the system. To overcome the
adverse effect of these communication constraints, various approaches have been
developed, among which a representative one is networked predictive control.
This approach proposes a controller, which compensates for the network time
delay and packet loss actively. This paper aims at implementing a networked
predictive control system for controlling a robot arm through a computer
network. The network delay is accounted for by a predictor, while the potential
of packet loss is mitigated using redundant control packets. The results will
show the stability of the system despite a high delay and a considerable packet
loss. Additionally, improvements to previous networked predictive control
systems will be suggested and an increase in performance can be shown. Lastly,
the effects of different system and environment parameters on the control loop
will be investigated.

and affect the initial binary population. Observing and interpreting the
dynamics of young massive clusters is key to our understanding of the star
formation process and predicting the outcome of stellar evolution. We have
studied NGC6611 in the Eagle Nebula (M16), a young massive cluster hosting 19 O
stars. We used Gaia EDR3 data to determine the membership, age, cluster
dynamics and the kinematics of the massive stars including runaways. The
membership analysis yields 137 members located at a mean distance of 1706 $\pm$
7 pc. The colour - absolute magnitude diagram reveals a blue and a red
population of pre-main-sequence stars, consistent with two distinct populations
of stars. In line with earlier studies, the youngest population has a mean
extinction $A_V$ = 3.6 $\pm$ 0.1 mag and an age = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 Myr, while the
older population of stars has a mean extinction $A_V$ = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 mag and
an age = 7.5 $\pm$ 0.4 Myr. The latter population is more spatially extended
than the younger generation of stars. We argue that most of the OB stars belong
to the younger population. We identify 8 runaways originating from the center
of NGC6611, consistent with the dynamical ejection scenario. We show that ~ 50%
of the O stars have velocities comparable to or greater than the escape
velocity. These O stars can be traced back to the center of NGC6611 with
kinematic ages ranging from 0 to 2 Myr. This suggests that dynamical
interactions played an important role in the early evolution of NGC6611, which
is surprising considering the low current stellar density. Comparing this to
simulations of young massive clusters, the required initial radius of 0.1-0.5
pc is not consistent with that of NGC6611. The O stars could have initially
formed in wide binaries and possibly harden through dynamical interactions.

recent zero-shot segmentation attracts a lot of attention by exploring the

propose a new open-world semantic segmentation pipeline that makes the first
attempt to learn to segment semantic objects of various open-world categories
without any efforts on dense annotations, by purely exploiting the
image-caption data that naturally exist on the Internet. Our method,
Vision-language-driven Semantic Segmentation (ViL-Seg), employs an image and a
text encoder to generate visual and text embeddings for the image-caption data,
with two core components that endow its segmentation ability: First, the image
encoder is jointly trained with a vision-based contrasting and a cross-modal
contrasting, which encourage the visual embeddings to preserve both
fine-grained semantics and high-level category information that are crucial for
the segmentation task. Furthermore, an online clustering head is devised over
the image encoder, which allows to dynamically segment the visual embeddings
into distinct semantic groups such that they can be classified by comparing
with various text embeddings to complete our segmentation pipeline. Experiments
show that without using any data with dense annotations, our method can
directly segment objects of arbitrary categories, outperforming zero-shot
segmentation methods that require data labeling on three benchmark datasets.

neuroscience, with a multitude of applications including diagnostic subtyping,
treatment optimization, and relapse prediction. It is therefore particularly
relevant to identify robust and clinically valuable brain biomarkers linking
symptoms to their underlying neural mechanisms. Brain biomarkers must be
reproducible (i.e., have internal reliability) across similar experiments
within a laboratory and be generalizable (i.e., have external reliability)
across experimental setups, laboratories, brain regions, and disease states.
However, reliability (internal and external) is not alone sufficient;
biomarkers also must have validity. Validity describes closeness to a true
measure of the underlying neural signal or disease state. We propose that these
two metrics, reliability and validity, should be evaluated and optimized before
any biomarker is used to inform treatment decisions. Here, we discuss these
metrics with respect to causal brain connectivity biomarkers from coupling
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG). We
discuss controversies around TMS-EEG stemming from the multiple large
off-target components (noise) and relatively weak genuine brain responses
(signal), as is unfortunately often the case with human neuroscience. We review
the current state of TMS-EEG recordings, which consist of a mix of reliable
noise and unreliable signal. We describe methods for evaluating TMS-EEG
biomarkers, including how to assess internal and external reliability across
facilities, cognitive states, brain networks, and disorders, and how to
validate these biomarkers using invasive neural recordings or treatment
response. We provide recommendations to increase reliability and validity,
discuss lessons learned, and suggest future directions for the field.

being useful for possible downstream applications, the estimated causal graph
also provides an explanation for the data-generating process. In this article,
we show that our algorithm estimates a good graph compared to the SOTA
approaches, even in environments whose underlying causal structure is
previously unseen. Further, we make an ablation study that shows how learning
interventions contribute to the overall performance of our approach. We
conclude that interventions indeed help boost the performance, efficiently

exploration of different sensing modalities in the past decades. This work
describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel induced
magnetic field-based 3D hand tracking system, aiming to address the
shortcomings of existing approaches and supply an alternative solution. This
system is composed of a set of transmitters for the magnetic field generation,
a receiver for field strength sensing, and the Zigbee units for
synchronization. In more detail, the transmitters generate the oscillating
magnetic fields with a registered sequence, the receiver senses the strength of
the induced magnetic field by a customized three axes coil, which is configured
as the LC oscillator with the same oscillating frequency so that an induced
current shows up when the receiver is located in the field of the generated
magnetic field. Five scenarios are explored to evaluate the performance of the
proposed system in hand tracking regarding the transmitters deployment: ""in
front of a whiteboard"", ""above a table"", ""in front of and in a shelf"", ""in
front of the waist and chest"", and ""around the waist"". The true-range
multilateration method is used to calculate the coordinates of the hand in 3D
space. Compared with the ground truth collected by a commercial ultrasound
positioning system, the presented magnetic field-based system shows a robust
accuracy of around ten centimeters with the transmitters deployed both off-body
and on-body(in front of waist and chest), which indicates the feasibility of
the proposed sensing modality in 3D hand tracking.

essential step in neuroimaging analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR-weighted) is an MRI contrast that is
particularly useful to visualize and quantify WMHs, a hallmark of cerebral
small vessel disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical MRI protocols
migrate to a three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR-weighted acquisition to enable high
spatial resolution in all three voxel dimensions. The current study details the
deployment of deep learning tools to enable automated WMH segmentation and
characterization from 3D FLAIR-weighted images acquired as part of a national
AD imaging initiative.
  Among 441 participants (194 male, mean age: (64.91 +/- 9.32) years) from the
DDI study, two in-house networks were trained and validated across five
national collection sites. Three models were tested on a held-out subset of the
internal data from the 441 participants and an external dataset with 29 cases
from an international collaborator. These test sets were evaluated
independently. Five established WMH performance metrics were used for
comparison against ground truth human-in-the-loop segmentation.
  Results of the three networks tested, the 3D nnU-Net had the best performance
with an average dice similarity coefficient score of 0.76 +/- 0.16, performing
better than both the in-house developed 2.5D model and the SOTA Deep Bayesian
network.
  With the increasing use of 3D FLAIR-weighted images in MRI protocols, our
results suggest that WMH segmentation models can be trained on 3D data and
yield WMH segmentation performance that is comparable to or better than
state-of-the-art without the need for including T1-weighted image series.

of airless planetary bodies is surface alteration by space weathering caused by
irradiation by solar wind and micrometeoroid particles. We aim to evaluate the
damage to the samples from H and laser irradiation and relate it to the
observed alteration in the spectra. We used olivine (OL) and pyroxene (OPX)
pellets irradiated by 5 keV H ions and individual fs laser pulses and measured
their visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectra. We observed the pellets
with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We studied structural,
mineralogical, and chemical modifications in the samples and connected them to
changes in the reflectance spectra. In both minerals, H irradiation induces
partially amorphous sub-surface layers containing small vesicles. In OL
pellets, these vesicles are more tightly packed than in OPX ones. Related
spectral change is mainly in the VIS spectral slope. Changes due to laser
irradiation are mostly dependent on material's melting temperature. Only the
laser-irradiated OL contains nanophase Fe particles, which induce detectable
spectral slope change throughout the measured spectral range. Our results
suggest that spectral changes at VIS-NIR wavelengths are mainly dependent on
thickness of (partially) amorphous sub-surface layers. Amorphisation smooths
microroughness, increasing the contribution of volume scattering and absorption
over surface scattering. Soon after exposure to the space environment, the
appearance of partially amorphous sub-surface layers results in rapid changes
in the VIS spectral slope. In later stages (onset of micrometeoroid
bombardment), we expect an emergence of nanoparticles to also mildly affect the
NIR spectral slope. An increase in dimensions of amorphous layers and vesicles
in the more space-weathered material will only cause band-depth variation and
darkening.

  Segmentation","Accepted by ECCV-2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical flow is an easily conceived and precious cue for advancing
unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS). Most of the previous methods
directly extract and fuse the motion and appearance features for segmenting
target objects in the UVOS setting. However, optical flow is intrinsically an
instantaneous velocity of all pixels among consecutive frames, thus making the
motion features not aligned well with the primary objects among the
corresponding frames. To solve the above challenge, we propose a concise,
practical, and efficient architecture for appearance and motion feature
alignment, dubbed hierarchical feature alignment network (HFAN). Specifically,
the key merits in HFAN are the sequential Feature AlignMent (FAM) module and
the Feature AdaptaTion (FAT) module, which are leveraged for processing the
appearance and motion features hierarchically. FAM is capable of aligning both
appearance and motion features with the primary object semantic
representations, respectively. Further, FAT is explicitly designed for the
adaptive fusion of appearance and motion features to achieve a desirable
trade-off between cross-modal features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed HFAN, which reaches a new state-of-the-art
performance on DAVIS-16, achieving 88.7 $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ Mean, i.e.,
a relative improvement of 3.5% over the best published result.

many machine learning researchers. Traditionally, poisoning attacks attempt to
inject adversarial training data in order to manipulate the trained model. In
federated learning (FL), data poisoning attacks can be generalized to model
poisoning attacks, which cannot be detected by simpler methods due to the lack
of access to local training data by the detector. State-of-the-art poisoning
attack detection methods for FL have various weaknesses, e.g., the number of
attackers has to be known or not high enough, working with i.i.d. data only,
and high computational complexity. To overcome above weaknesses, we propose a
novel framework for detecting poisoning attacks in FL, which employs a
reference model based on a public dataset and an auditor model to detect
malicious updates. We implemented a detector based on the proposed framework
and using a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), which reaches the lowest
possible computational complexity O(K) where K is the number of clients. We
evaluated our detector's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) poisoning
attacks for two typical applications of FL: electrocardiograph (ECG)
classification and human activity recognition (HAR). Our experimental results
validated the performance of our detector over other SOTA detection methods.

the encoder transforms the input image to a latent representation using a deep

the available side information. In the proposed method, the decoder employs a
cross-attention module to align the feature maps obtained from the received

the standard Fourier form, the constitutive law of the heat flux is assumed in
the form given by the theory developed by Green and Naghdi, which accounts for

reducing onwards transmission of COVID-19, particularly when combined with the
isolation and contact-tracing of positive cases. Many countries with the
capacity to do so have made use of lab-processed Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) testing targeted at individuals with symptoms and the contacts of
confirmed cases. Alternatively, Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs) are able to deliver a
result quickly, without lab-processing and at a relatively low cost. Their
adoption can support regular mass asymptomatic testing, allowing earlier
detection of infection and isolation of infectious individuals. In this paper
we extend and apply the agent-based epidemic modelling framework Covasim to
explore the impact of regular asymptomatic testing on the peak and total number
of infections in an emerging COVID-19 wave. We explore testing with LFTs at
different frequency levels within a population with high levels of immunity and
with background symptomatic PCR testing, case isolation and contact tracing for
testing. The effectiveness of regular asymptomatic testing was compared with
`lockdown' interventions seeking to reduce the number of non-household contacts
across the whole population through measures such as mandating working from
home and restrictions on gatherings. Since regular asymptomatic testing
requires only those with a positive result to reduce contact, while lockdown
measures require the whole population to reduce contact, any policy decision
that seeks to trade off harms from infection against other harms will not
automatically favour one over the other. Our results demonstrate that, where
such a trade off is being made, at moderate rates of early exponential growth
regular asymptomatic testing has the potential to achieve significant infection
control without the wider harms associated with additional lockdown measures.

the previous frame to update the graph embedding in the current frame. Since
existing communication systems send a pilot during each frame, Air-MPRNN can be
integrated into the existing standards by adjusting pilot power. Simulation

symmetries: UG is based on transverse diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings
(WTDiff transformations), whereas GR is based on the full group of
diffeomorphisms. This difference is related to the existence of a fiduciary

present an overview as complete as possible of situations and regimes in which

The usage of auto-positioning decreases the installation efforts of
localization systems and therefore allows their market-wide dissemination.
Since observations and position information in this scenario are correlated,
the uncertainties of all nodes need to be considered. In this paper we propose
a discrete Bayesian method based on a multi-dimensional histogram filter to
solve the task of robust auto-positioning, allowing to propagate historical

accurately predict the electronic band structures of 267 different defects.
Moreover, using strain-tuning we can tailor the optical transition energy of
suitable quantum emitters to match precisely that of quantum technology

used to initialize a computationally efficient gradient search to perform
maximum likelihood position estimation. Our proposal is validated with an

The difficulty of the problem lies in parameterizing the state estimates.
However the existing methods are not able to treat it well. We propose to use
power moments to obtain a parameterization. Unlike the existing parametric
estimation methods, our proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge
about the state to be estimated, e.g. the number of modes and the feasible
classes of function. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not required to store
massive parameters during filtering as the existing nonparametric Bayesian
filters, e.g. the particle filter. The parameters of the proposed
parametrization can also be determined by a convex optimization scheme with
moments constraints, to which the solution is proved to exist and be unique. A
necessary and sufficient condition for all the power moments of the density
estimate to exist and be finite is provided. The errors of power moments are
analyzed for the density estimate being either light-tailed or heavy-tailed.
Error upper bounds of the density estimate for the one-step prediction are
proposed. Simulation results on different types of density functions of the
state are given, including the heavy-tailed densities, to validate the proposed
algorithm.

luminosity functions, the DES and ZTF samples of SNe II are brighter than that
of LOSS with significances of 3.0$\sigma$ and 2.5$\sigma$ respectively. While
this difference could be caused by redshift evolution in the luminosity
function, simpler explanations such as differing levels of host extinction
remain a possibility. We find that the host galaxies of SNe II in DES are on
average bluer than in ZTF, despite having consistent stellar mass
distributions. We consider a number of possibilities to explain this --

direction of propagation. Despite vastly different platforms and underlying
working principles, the realisations of nonreciprocal transport in linear,
time-independent systems rely on Aharonov-Bohm interference among several
pathways and require breaking time-reversal symmetry. Here we extend the notion
of nonreciprocity to unidirectional bosonic transport in systems with a
time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian by exploiting interference between
beamsplitter (excitation preserving) and two-mode-squeezing (excitation
non-preserving) interactions. In contrast to standard nonreciprocity, this
unidirectional transport manifests when the mode quadratures are resolved with
respect to an external reference phase. Hence we dub this phenomenon quadrature
nonreciprocity. First, we experimentally demonstrate it in the minimal system
of two coupled nanomechanical modes orchestrated by optomechanical

However, the credibility of image difficulty is rarely investigated, which can
seriously affect the effectiveness of curricula. In this work, we propose
Angular Gap, a measure of difficulty based on the difference in angular
distance between feature embeddings and class-weight embeddings built by
hyperspherical learning. To ascertain difficulty estimation, we introduce
class-wise model calibration, as a post-training technique, to the learnt
hyperbolic space. This bridges the gap between probabilistic model calibration
and angular distance estimation of hyperspherical learning. We show the
superiority of our calibrated Angular Gap over recent difficulty metrics on
CIFAR10-H and ImageNetV2. We further propose Angular Gap based curriculum
learning for unsupervised domain adaptation that can translate from learning
easy samples to mining hard samples. We combine this curriculum with a

low cost and setup simplicity. It takes an RGB image as input and predicts 3D
boxes in the 3D space. The most challenging sub-task lies in the instance depth
estimation. Previous works usually use a direct estimation method. However, in
this paper we point out that the instance depth on the RGB image is
non-intuitive. It is coupled by visual depth clues and instance attribute
clues, making it hard to be directly learned in the network. Therefore, we
propose to reformulate the instance depth to the combination of the instance
visual surface depth (visual depth) and the instance attribute depth (attribute
depth). The visual depth is related to objects' appearances and positions on
the image. By contrast, the attribute depth relies on objects' inherent
attributes, which are invariant to the object affine transformation on the
image. Correspondingly, we decouple the 3D location uncertainty into visual
depth uncertainty and attribute depth uncertainty. By combining different types
of depths and associated uncertainties, we can obtain the final instance depth.
Furthermore, data augmentation in monocular 3D detection is usually limited due
to the physical nature, hindering the boost of performance. Based on the
proposed instance depth disentanglement strategy, we can alleviate this
problem. Evaluated on KITTI, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results,
and extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in
our method. The codes are released at https://github.com/SPengLiang/DID-M3D.

negatively affecting life quality even at sub-diagnostic thresholds. We sought
to characterize SA's acoustic signature using hypothesis-testing and machine
learning (ML) approaches. Methods - Participants formed spontaneous utterances
responding to instructions to refuse or consent to commands of alleged peers.
Vocal properties (e.g., intensity and duration) of these utterances were
analyzed. Results - Our prediction that, as compared to low-SA (n=31), high-SA
(n=32) individuals exhibit a less confident vocal speech signature, especially
with respect to refusal utterances, was only partially supported by the
classical hypothesis-testing approach. However, the results of the ML analyses
and specifically the decision tree classifier were consistent with such speech
patterns in SA. Using a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier, we were able to
distinguish between high- and low-SA individuals with high (75.6%) accuracy and
good (.83 AUC) separability. We also expected and found that vocal properties
differentiated between refusal and consent utterances. Conclusions - Our
findings provide further support for the usefulness of ML approach for the
study of psychopathology, highlighting the utility of developing automatic
techniques to create behavioral markers of SAD. Clinically, the simplicity and
accessibility of these procedures may encourage people to seek professional

$2.1\sigma$. From the new data, we determine for the first time the imaginary
part of the CKM-subleading, $U$-spin breaking $\Delta U=1$ correction to the
$U$-spin limit $\Delta U=0$ amplitude. The imaginary part of the $\Delta U=0$
amplitude is determined by $\Delta a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}}$. The corresponding
strong phases are yet unknown and could be extracted in the future from
time-dependent measurements. Assuming $\mathcal{O}(1)$ strong phases due to
non-perturbative rescattering, we find the ratio of $U$-spin breaking to

extensively studied to improve the convergence rates of stochastic non-convex

mappings across iterations but only with access to stochastic samples of
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ functional mappings at each iteration? There is an important
application in solving an emerging family of coupled compositional optimization
problems in the form of $\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(g_i(\mathbf{w}))$, where $g_i$ is
accessible through a stochastic oracle. The key issue is to track and estimate
a sequence of $\mathbf g(\mathbf{w})=(g_1(\mathbf{w}), \ldots,
g_m(\mathbf{w}))$ across iterations, where $\mathbf g(\mathbf{w})$ has $m$
blocks and it is only allowed to probe $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks to attain their
stochastic values and Jacobians. To improve the complexity for solving these

Variance Reduced (MSVR) estimator to track the sequence of $\mathbf
g(\mathbf{w})$. It is inspired by STORM but introduces a customized error
correction term to alleviate the noise not only in stochastic samples for the
selected blocks but also in those blocks that are not sampled. With the help of
the MSVR estimator, we develop several algorithms for solving the
aforementioned compositional problems with improved complexities across a
spectrum of settings with non-convex/convex/strongly

representations of knowledge graphs towards the link prediction problem.
Recently developed frameworks can be effectively applied in research related
applications. Yet, these frameworks do not fulfill many requirements of
real-world applications. As the size of the knowledge graph grows, moving
computation from a commodity computer to a cluster of computers in these
frameworks becomes more challenging. Finding suitable hyperparameter settings
w.r.t. time and computational budgets are left to practitioners. In addition,
the continual learning aspect in knowledge graph embedding frameworks is often
ignored, although continual learning plays an important role in many real-world
(deep) learning-driven applications. Arguably, these limitations explain the
lack of publicly available knowledge graph embedding models for large knowledge
graphs. We developed a framework based on the frameworks DASK, Pytorch
Lightning and Hugging Face to compute embeddings for large-scale knowledge
graphs in a hardware-agnostic manner, which is able to address real-world
challenges pertaining to the scale of real application. We provide an
open-source version of our framework along with a hub of pre-trained models

bonded strongly on HGY sheet due to charge transfer from Y 4d orbital to C 2p
orbital whereas the adsorption of H$_2$ molecule on Y is due to Kubas-type
interactions involving charge donation from H 1s orbital to Y 3d orbital and
back donation with net charge gain by H 1s orbital. Furthermore, sufficient
energy barriers for metal atom diffusion have been found to prevent the
clustering of transition metal (yttrium) on the HGY sheet. The stability of the
system at higher temperatures is analyzed using Ab-initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) method and the system is found to be stable at room and the highest
desorption temperature. Stability of the system at higher temperatures,
presence of adequate diffusion energy barrier to prevent metal-metal

attention, with the goal to segment target objects in a query image given only
a few annotated support images of the target class. A key to this challenging
task is to fully utilize the information in the support images by exploiting
fine-grained correlations between the query and support images. However, most
existing approaches either compressed the support information into a few
class-wise prototypes, or used partial support information (e.g., only
foreground) at the pixel level, causing non-negligible information loss. In
this paper, we propose Dense pixel-wise Cross-query-and-support Attention
weighted Mask Aggregation (DCAMA), where both foreground and background support
information are fully exploited via multi-level pixel-wise correlations between
paired query and support features. Implemented with the scaled dot-product
attention in the Transformer architecture, DCAMA treats every query pixel as a
token, computes its similarities with all support pixels, and predicts its
segmentation label as an additive aggregation of all the support pixels' labels
-- weighted by the similarities. Based on the unique formulation of DCAMA, we
further propose efficient and effective one-pass inference for n-shot
segmentation, where pixels of all support images are collected for the mask
aggregation at once. Experiments show that our DCAMA significantly advances the
state of the art on standard FSS benchmarks of PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and

multiply the completion time of a job by the individual weight of the job. We
apply competitive analysis to evaluate our algorithms.
  We improve 25-year-old lower bounds for the competitive ratio of this problem
by optimizing a simple job pattern. These lower bounds decrease with growing
numbers of machines. Based on the job pattern, we develop an online algorithm
which is an extension of the delayed-SPT (Shortest Processing Time first)

the surrounding obstacles and track their moving trajectories, which lays the
ground for the subsequent driving decision making process. Although the
security of obstacle detection in SDC is intensively studied, not until very
recently the attackers start to exploit the vulnerability of the tracking
module. Compared with solely attacking the object detectors, this new attack
strategy influences the driving decision more effectively with less attack
budgets. However, little is known on whether the revealed vulnerability remains
effective in end-to-end self-driving systems and, if so, how to mitigate the
threat.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic research on the security of
object tracking in SDC. Through a comprehensive case study on the full
perception pipeline of a popular open-sourced self-driving system, Baidu's
Apollo, we prove the mainstream multi-object tracker (MOT) based on Kalman
Filter (KF) is unsafe even with an enabled multi-sensor fusion mechanism. Our
root cause analysis reveals, the vulnerability is innate to the design of
KF-based MOT, which shall error-handle the prediction results from the object
detectors yet the adopted KF algorithm is prone to trust the observation more
when its deviation from the prediction is larger. To address this design flaw,
we propose a simple yet effective security patch for KF-based MOT, the core of
which is an adaptive strategy to balance the focus of KF on observations and
predictions according to the anomaly index of the observation-prediction
deviation, and has certified effectiveness against a generalized hijacking
attack model. Extensive evaluation on $4$ KF-based existing MOT implementations

effectiveness and the trivial performance overhead of our approach.

non-equilibrium phenomena, that can be analyzed using Floquet theory.
Naturally, Floquet theory is employed to describe the dynamics of atoms
interacting with intense laser fields. However, this semiclassical analysis can
not account for quantum-optical phenomena that rely on the quantized nature of
light. In this paper, we take a significant step to go beyond the semiclassical
description of atom-photon coupled systems by unifying Floquet theory with
quantum optics using the framework of Full-Counting Statistics. This is
achieved by introducing counting fields that keep track of the photonic
dynamics. This formalism, which is dubbed ``Photon-resolved Floquet theory""
(PRFT), is based on two-point tomographic measurements, instead of the
two-point projective measurements used in standard Full-Counting Statistics.
Strikingly, the PRFT predicts the generation of macroscopic light-matter
entanglement when atoms interact with multi-frequency electromagnetic fields,
thereby leading to complete decoherence of the atomic subsystem in the basis of
the Floquet states. This decoherence occurs rapidly in the optical frequency
regime, but is negligible in the radio frequency regime. Intriguingly, time
crystals can act as good quantum memories even in the optical frequency regime.
Our results thus pave the way for the design of efficient quantum memories and
quantum operations. Finally, employing the PRFT, we propose a quantum
communication protocol that can significantly outperform the state-of-art
few-photon protocols by two orders of magnitude or better. The PRFT potentially
leads to new insights in various Floquet settings including spectroscopy,
thermodynamics, quantum metrology, and quantum simulations.

energy of a band of states. In this context, approximate quantum calculations
imply transition not to the single, minimum energy, state but to a group of
states close to the minimum. We consider dynamics and the result of two
possible realization of such a process -- transition of population from a
single initially populated isolated level to the quantum states at the edge of
a band of levels. The first case deals with the time-independent Hamiltonian,
while the other with a moving isolated level. We demonstrate that the energy
width of the population energy distribution over the band is mainly dictated by
the time-energy uncertainty principle, although the specific shape of the
distribution depends on the particular setting. We consider the role of the
statistics of the coupling matrix elements between the isolated level and the
band levels. We have chosen the multiphoton Raman absorption by an ensemble of
Rydberg atoms as the model for our analysis, although the results obtained can

paper defines link prediction and entity typing tasks on DH-KG for the first
time and constructs two DH-KG datasets, JW44K-6K, extracted from Wikidata, and
HTDM based on medical data. Furthermore, we propose DHGE, a DH-KG embedding

  Differential Geometric Control and Extremum Seeking System Approach with Real

mysterious and intriguing for biologists, physicists, aeronautical/control
engineers, and applied mathematicians. These fascinating biological organisms
have the ability to fly for long-duration while spending little to no energy.
This flight technique/maneuver is called dynamic soaring (DS). For biologists
and physicists, the DS phenomenon is nothing but a wonder of the very elegant
ability of the bird's interaction with nature and using its physical ether in
an optimal way for better survival and energy efficiency. For the engineering
community, it is a source of inspiration and an unequivocal promising chance
for bio-mimicking. In literature, significant work has been done on modeling
and constructing control systems that allow the DS maneuver to be mimicked.
However, mathematical characterization of the DS phenomenon in literature has
been limited to optimal control configurations that utilized developments in
numerical optimization algorithms along with control methods to identify the
optimal DS trajectory taken (or to be taken) by the bird/mimicking system. In
this paper, we provide a novel two-layered mathematical approach to
characterize, model, mimic, and control DS in a simple and real-time
implementation. The first layer will be a differential geometric control
formulation and analysis of the DS problem. The second layer will be a linkage
between the DS philosophy and a class of dynamical control systems known as
extremum seeking systems. We believe our framework captures more of the
biological behavior of soaring birds and opens the door for geometric control
theory and extremum seeking systems to be utilized in systems biology and
natural phenomena. Simulation results are provided along with comparisons with
powerful optimal control solvers to illustrate the advantages of the introduced
method.

tilts to the $z$ direction. During this tilting, it rotates around the $z$

with frequencies higher than the nutation frequency align the order parameter
parallel to the field direction, while for lower frequencies it is oriented
perpendicular to the field. The switching frequency increases with the magnetic
field strength, and it deviates from the Larmor frequency, making it possible
to outpace precessional switching in high magnetic fields.

leveraging different statistical and geometrical properties of the input for
the computation of a highly descriptive attention map. In this way, the
proposed attention mechanism can guide a Vision Transformer to become more
attentive towards important appearance, color and texture features of an image,
leading to improved classification results, as shown by the experimental
results on well-known image classification datasets.

Hessenberg varieties in Lie type A, and focusing on the affine coordinate chart
on $\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n) \cong GL_n(\mathbb{C})/B$ corresponding to the
longest element $w_0$ of the Weyl group $S_n$ of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. Our main
results are as follows. Let $h$ be an indecomposable Hessenberg function. We
prove that the local defining ideal $I_{w_0,h}$ in the $w_0$-chart of the
regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(\mathsf{N},h)$ associated
to $h$ has a Gr\""obner basis with respect to a suitably chosen monomial order.
Our Gr\""obner basis consists of a collection $\{f^{w_0}_{k,\ell}\}$ of
generators of $I_{w_0,h}$ obtained by Abe, DeDieu, Galetto, and the second
author. We also prove that $I_{w_0,h}$ is geometrically vertex decomposable in
the sense of Klein and Rajchgot (building on work of Knutson, Miller, and
Yong). We give two distinct proofs of the above results. We make this
unconventional choice of exposition because our first proof introduces and
utilizes a notion of a triangular complete intersection which is of independent
interest, while our second proof using liaison theory is more likely to be
generalizable to the general $w$-charts for $w \neq w_0$. Finally, using our
Gr\""obner analysis of the $f^{w_0}_{k,\ell}$ above and for $p>0$ any prime, we
construct an explicit Frobenius splitting of the $w_0$-chart of
$\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ which simultaneously compatibly splits all the
local defining ideals of $I_{w_0,h}$, as $h$ ranges over the set of
indecomposable Hessenberg functions. This last result is a local Hessenberg
analogue of a classical result known for $\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ and the
collection of Schubert and opposite Schubert varieties in
$\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n)$.

can in general be adequately described by general relativity and a uniform and
isotropic metric minimally coupled with a collection of perfect fluids. These
fluids are usually described by their energy-momentum tensor, which can be
derived from the fluid's Lagrangian density. Under general relativity, the
Lagrangian density is only relevant to the extent that it results in the
correct energy-momentum tensor for a specific perfect fluid. This is not the
case in theories that feature a nonminimal coupling (NMC) between the matter
fields and gravity. In such cases, the on-shell Lagrangian density of the
matter fields appears explicitly in the equations of motion, in addition to
their energy-momentum tensor. The determination of the correct on-shell
Lagrangian density for a particular fluid is therefore of paramount importance
in order to provide an accurate description of the corresponding cosmological
implications. In essence, this is the problem tackled in this thesis.
  We have aimed at addressing three key points. We covered some of the results
in the literature regarding the Lagrangian density of cosmic fluids, and
cleared up some misunderstandings regarding the freedom of choice (or lack
thereof) of its on-shell form, both in general relativity and in theories
featuring an NMC. In addition, we derived the correct Lagrangian density for
fluids composed of solitonic particles with fixed rest mass and structure.
Secondly, we studied the thermodynamic behaviour of perfect fluids of this type
in the context of theories featuring an NMC between gravity and the matter
fields. Finally, we used these results to derive novel cosmological constraints
on specific NMC gravity models, using data from cosmic microwave background,
big-bang nucleosynthesis, type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations
observations.

Our relaxation enjoys several theoretical and practical advantages:
Theoretically, we prove that our method provides a $\sqrt{2}$-factor
approximation to the Robust Procrustes problem, and that, under appropriate

correspondences contaminated by outliers. In practice, we find in numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real robust Procrustes problems, that our

convex penalties, which are not readily amenable to IRLS. This turns out to be
a substantial advantage, leading to improved results in high-dimensional

forth data-driven self-triggered control schemes for unknown linear systems

systems, a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed, which
computes a sequence of control inputs while generating a predicted system
trajectory. A data-driven self-triggering law is designed using the predicted
trajectory, to determine the next triggering time once a new measurement
becomes available. For state feedback control systems, instead of capitalizing
on MPC to predict the trajectory, a data-fitting problem using the
pre-collected input-state data is solved, whose solution is employed to
construct the self-triggering mechanism. Both feasibility and stability are
established for the proposed self-triggered controllers, which are validated

accurate prediction of molecular properties. Despite the significant
advancement of graph neural networks (GNNs) in molecular representation
learning, they generally face limitations such as neighbors-explosion,
under-reaching, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. Also, GNNs usually have
high computational costs because of the large-scale number of parameters.
Typically, such limitations emerge or increase when facing relatively
large-size graphs or using a deeper GNN model architecture. An idea to overcome
these problems is to simplify a molecular graph into a small, rich, and
informative one, which is more efficient and less challenging to train GNNs. To
this end, we propose a novel molecular graph coarsening framework named FunQG
utilizing Functional groups, as influential building blocks of a molecule to
determine its properties, based on a graph-theoretic concept called Quotient
Graph. By experiments, we show that the resulting informative graphs are much
smaller than the molecular graphs and thus are good candidates for training
GNNs. We apply the FunQG on popular molecular property prediction benchmarks
and then compare the performance of some popular baseline GNNs on the obtained
datasets with the performance of several state-of-the-art baselines on the
original datasets. By experiments, this method significantly outperforms
previous baselines on various datasets, besides its dramatic reduction in the
number of parameters and low computational costs. Therefore, the FunQG can be
used as a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for solving the molecular
representation learning problem.

effects of dust entrainment in photoevaporative winds and the ejection and drag
of dust due to effects caused by radiation from the central star. We improved
and extended the existing implementation of a two-population dust and pebble
description in the global Bern/Heidelberg planet formation and evolution model.
Modern prescriptions for photoevaporative winds were used and we account for
settling and advection of dust when calculating entrainment rates. In order to
prepare for future population studies with varying conditions, we explore a
wide range of disk-, photoevaporation-, and dust-parameters. We find that if
dust can grow to pebble sizes, that is, if they are resistant to fragmentation
or turbulence is weak, drift dominates and the entrained mass is small but
larger than under the assumption of no vertical advection of grains with the
gas flow. For the case of fragile dust shattering at velocities of 1 m/s - as
indicated in laboratory experiments -, an order of magnitude more dust is
entrained which becomes the main dust removal process. Radiation pressure
effects disperse massive, dusty disks on timescales of a few 100 Myr. These
results highlight the importance of dust entrainment in winds as a solid mass
removal process. Furthermore, this model extension lies the basis for future

(HR) visual experience and storage or bandwidth constraints. Therefore, this
paper proposes a Multi-View Image Super-Resolution (MVISR) task. It aims to
increase the resolution of multi-view images captured from the same scene. One
solution is to apply image or video super-resolution (SR) methods to
reconstruct HR results from the low-resolution (LR) input view. However, these
methods cannot handle large-angle transformations between views and leverage
information in all multi-view images. To address these problems, we propose the
MVSRnet, which uses geometry information to extract sharp details from all LR
multi-view to support the SR of the LR input view. Specifically, the proposed
Geometry-Aware Reference Synthesis module in MVSRnet uses geometry information
and all multi-view LR images to synthesize pixel-aligned HR reference images.
Then, the proposed Dynamic High-Frequency Search network fully exploits the
high-frequency textural details in reference images for SR. Extensive
experiments on several benchmarks show that our method significantly improves
over the state-of-the-art approaches.

and a low spatial resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image to obtain an HRMS
image is known as pansharpening. With the development of convolutional neural
networks, the performance of pansharpening methods has been improved, however,
the blurry effects and the spectral distortion still exist in their fusion
results due to the insufficiency in details learning and the frequency mismatch
between MSand PAN. Therefore, the improvement of spatial details at the premise
of reducing spectral distortion is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose
a frequency-aware fusion network (FAFNet) together with a novel high-frequency
feature similarity loss to address above mentioned problems. FAFNet is mainly
composed of two kinds of blocks, where the frequency aware blocks aim to
extract features in the frequency domain with the help of discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) layers, and the frequency fusion blocks reconstruct and
transform the features from frequency domain to spatial domain with the
assistance of inverse DWT (IDWT) layers. Finally, the fusion results are
obtained through a convolutional block. In order to learn the correspondence,
we also propose a high-frequency feature similarity loss to constrain the HF
features derived from PAN and MS branches, so that HF features of PAN can
reasonably be used to supplement that of MS. Experimental results on three
datasets at both reduced- and full-resolution demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art pansharpening
models.

  scattering direct detection experiments","23 pages, 10 figures, 1 table",,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In 2020 the XENON1T experiment observed an excess of events with an electron
recoil energy $E_R$ in the range of $2\,$--$\,3\,$keV. Such an excess can arise
from a variety of sources such as solar axions or a neutrino magnetic moment,
but also from inelastic scattering of dark matter off the xenon atoms. The
recoil energy of the electron then depends on the mass difference of the dark
particles. In this paper we show that the annual modulation of both the event
rate and the electron recoil energy provide important additional information
that allows to distinguish among different theoretical explanations of the
signal. To this end, we first extend the formalism of annual modulation to
electronic recoils, inelastic dark matter scattering and the electron recoil
energy. We then study a concrete theoretical model with two Dirac fermions and
a dark photon. We take into account all relevant cosmological and experimental
constraints on this model and apply it to the XENON1T and and XENONnT
experiments with realistic detection thresholds, efficiencies and energy
resolutions, fitting the main physical parameters of the model, i.e. the mass
splitting and the electron scattering cross section. The discriminatory power
of the additional information from the annual modulation of both the signal
rate and the electron recoil energy is then demonstrated for XENONnT with a
simplified model based on these main physical parameters. This more sensitive
procedure compared to time-only modulation analyses can also serve as a
template for other theoretical models with different dark matter candidates,
mediators and cosmology. For the $U(1)$ model with two Dirac fermions fitting
the XENON1T excess and the experimental conditions of XENONnT, taking into
account the annual variation of the signal rate and recoil energy allows for a
faster and more precise determination of the free model parameters.

between cause (input) and effect (output). This causal relation is believed to
be universally true for all physical processes. Here we show, on the contrary,
that it is inadequate to establish correct correspondence between cause and
effect in quantum mechanics. In fact, there are instances within the framework
of quantum mechanics where the use of classical Bayes' rule leads to
inconsistencies in quantum measurement inferences, such as Frauchiger-Renner's
paradox. Similar inconsistency also appears in the context of Hardy's setup
even after assuming quantum mechanics as a non-local theory. As a remedy, we
introduce an input-output causal relation based on quantum Bayes' rule. It
applies to general quantum processes even when a cause (or effect) is in
coherent superposition with other causes (or effects), involves nonlocal
correlations as allowed by quantum mechanics, and in the cases where causes
belonging to one system induce effects in some other system as it happens in
quantum measurement processes. This enables us to propose a resolution to the
contradictions that appear in the context of Frauchiger-Renner's and Hardy's
setups. Our results thereby affirm that quantum mechanics, equipped with
quantum Bayes' rule, can indeed consistently explain the use of itself.

$L_F:L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)\to L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, where $F$ is a weight in

1988, inaugurating a new, geometric, phase-space perspective. Sharp upper
bounds for the norm (and the singular values) of such operators turn out to be
a challenging issue with deep applications in signal recovery, quantum physics
and the study of uncertainty principles. In this note we provide optimal upper
bounds for the operator norm $\|L_F\|_{L^2\to L^2}$, assuming $F\in
L^p(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$, $1<p<\infty$ or $F\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^{2d})\cap
L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$, $1\leq p<\infty$. It turns out that two regimes
arise, depending on whether the quantity $\|F\|_{L^p}/\|F\|_{L^\infty}$ is less
or greater than a certain critical value. In the first regime the extremal
weights $F$, for which equality occurs in the estimates, are certain Gaussians,
whereas in the second regime they are proved to be truncated Gaussians,
degenerating in a multiple of a characteristic function of a ball for $p=1$.
This phase transition through truncated Gaussians appears to be a new
phenomenon in time-frequency concentration problems. For the analogous problem
for wavelet localization operators -- where the Cauchy wavelet plays the role

series of events in the untrimmed video, which can be divided into two
sub-tasks, event detection and event captioning. Unlike previous works that
tackle the two sub-tasks separately, recent works have focused on enhancing the
inter-task association between the two sub-tasks. However, designing inter-task
interactions for event detection and captioning is not trivial due to the large
differences in their task specific solutions. Besides, previous event detection
methods normally ignore temporal dependencies between events, leading to event
redundancy or inconsistency problems. To tackle above the two defects, in this
paper, we define event detection as a sequence generation task and propose a
unified pre-training and fine-tuning framework to naturally enhance the
inter-task association between event detection and captioning. Since the model
predicts each event with previous events as context, the inter-dependency
between events is fully exploited and thus our model can detect more diverse
and consistent events in the video. Experiments on the ActivityNet dataset show
that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and can be further
boosted when pre-trained on extra large-scale video-text data. Code is

to the exponentially increasing scale of graph data and the number of model
parameters, which restricts their utility in practical applications. To this
end, some recent works focus on sparsifying GNNs with the lottery ticket
hypothesis (LTH) to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance
levels. However, the LTH-based methods suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) they
require exhaustive and iterative training of dense models, resulting in an
extremely large training computation cost, and 2) they only trim graph
structures and model parameters but ignore the node feature dimension, where
significant redundancy exists. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
comprehensive graph gradual pruning framework termed CGP. This is achieved by
designing a during-training graph pruning paradigm to dynamically prune GNNs
within one training process. Unlike LTH-based methods, the proposed CGP
approach requires no re-training, which significantly reduces the computation
costs. Furthermore, we design a co-sparsifying strategy to comprehensively trim
all three core elements of GNNs: graph structures, node features, and model
parameters. Meanwhile, aiming at refining the pruning operation, we introduce a
regrowth process into our CGP framework, in order to re-establish the pruned
but important connections. The proposed CGP is evaluated by using a node
classification task across 6 GNN architectures, including shallow models (GCN
and GAT), shallow-but-deep-propagation models (SGC and APPNP), and deep models
(GCNII and ResGCN), on a total of 14 real-world graph datasets, including

Accepted by ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep implicit functions have shown remarkable shape modeling ability in
various 3D computer vision tasks. One drawback is that it is hard for them to
represent a 3D shape as multiple parts. Current solutions learn various
primitives and blend the primitives directly in the spatial space, which still
struggle to approximate the 3D shape accurately. To resolve this problem, we
introduce a novel implicit representation to represent a single 3D shape as a
set of parts in the latent space, towards both highly accurate and plausibly
interpretable shape modeling. Our insight here is that both the part learning
and the part blending can be conducted much easier in the latent space than in
the spatial space. We name our method Latent Partition Implicit (LPI), because
of its ability of casting the global shape modeling into multiple local part
modeling, which partitions the global shape unity. LPI represents a shape as
Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) using surface codes. Each surface code is a
latent code representing a part whose center is on the surface, which enables
us to flexibly employ intrinsic attributes of shapes or additional surface
properties. Eventually, LPI can reconstruct both the shape and the parts on the
shape, both of which are plausible meshes. LPI is a multi-level representation,
which can partition a shape into different numbers of parts after training. LPI
can be learned without ground truth signed distances, point normals or any
supervision for part partition. LPI outperforms the latest methods under the
widely used benchmarks in terms of reconstruction accuracy and modeling
interpretability. Our code, data and models are available at

rays originate. This scenario, however, fails to explain some of the features
observed in the cosmic-ray spectrum. Microquasars have been proposed as
additional candidates, because their non-thermal emission indicates the
existence of efficient particle acceleration mechanisms in their jets. A
promising scenario envisages the production of relativistic neutrons in the
jets, that decay outside the system injecting relativistic protons to the
surroundings. The first investigations of this scenario suggest that
microquasars might be fairly alternative cosmic-ray sources.
  We aim at assessing the role played by the degree of collimation of the jet
on the cosmic-ray energetics in the neutron-carrier scenario, as well as the
properties of the emission region. Our goals are to explain the Galactic
component of the observed proton cosmic-ray spectrum at energies higher than
$\sim 10$ GeV and to relate the mentioned jet properties with the power and
spectral index of the produced cosmic rays. We find that collimated jets, with
compact acceleration regions close to the jet base, are very efficient sources
that could deliver a fraction of up to $\sim 0.01$ of their relativistic proton
luminosity into cosmic rays. Collimation is the most significant feature
regarding efficiency; a well collimated jet might be $\sim 4$ orders of
magnitude more efficient than a poorly collimated one. The main feature of the
presented mechanism is the production of a spectrum with a steeper spectral
index ($\sim 2.3$ at energies up to $\sim 10$ TeV) than in the supernova
scenario, and closer to what is observed. The predictions of our model may be
used to infer the total contribution of the population of Galactic microquasars

spectral characterization of the system throughout its 2021, two-week-long
outburst, analyzing 11 NICER observations and quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR single observations at the outburst peak. The broadband spectrum is
well-modeled with a black body component with a temperature of $\sim$0.6 keV,
most likely consistent with a hot spot on the neutron star surface, and a
Comptonisation spectrum with power-law index $\Gamma \sim 1.9$, arising from a
hot corona at $\sim$12 keV. No direct emission from the disc was found,
possibly due to it being too cool. A high truncation radius for the disc, i.e.,
at $\sim$20--30 R$_{G}$ , was obtained from the analysis of the broadened
profile of the Fe line in the reflection component. The significant detection
of a blue-shifted Fe XXVI absorption line at $\sim$7 keV indicates weakly
relativistic X-ray disc winds, which are typically absent in the hard state of
X-ray binaries. By comparing the low flux observed during the outburst and the
one expected in a conservative mass-transfer, we conclude that mass-transfer in
the system is highly non-conservative, as also suggested by the wind detection.
Finally, using the Nicer spectra alone, we followed the system while it was
fading to quiescence. During the outburst decay, as the spectral shape
hardened, the hot spot on the neutron star surface cooled down and shrank, a
trend which could be consistent with the pure power-law spectrum observed
during quiescence.

of the thesis, we will address the PBH properties at the time of formation,
that are their masses, spins and abundance, and investigate the generation of
Gravitational Wave (GW) signals during their production. In the second part, we
will describe the PBHs evolution across the cosmic history due to their
assemble in binaries, phases of baryonic mass accretion and clustering effects.
We will then discuss GW signatures coming from their coalescence, compare these
predictions with present GW data detected by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC)
and assess the role of future GW experiments like 3G detectors and LISA in
discovering these objects. Finally, in the third part, we will investigate some
aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the
early universe, focusing on the role of GWs to shed light on their properties.

extremely fast-rotating models, based on the initial mass. For stars more
massive than $\sim 1.3~M_\odot$ the full rotation range, from low to the
critical one, is considered. We adopt the solar-scaled chemical mixture by
Caffau et al. with Z$_\odot$ = 0.01524. All the evolutionary phases from the
pre-main-sequence to the first few thermal-pulses on the
asymptotic-giant-branch or central C exhaustion, are considered. The
corresponding theoretical isochrones are further derived with TRILEGAL code and
are converted in several photometric systems, taking into account different

invariant of quadratic forms, using the trace form of a hermitian form. When
the algebra with unitary involution has a symplectic or orthogonal descent, or
a symplectic or orthogonal quadratic extension, we provide comparison theorems
between the corresponding invariants of unitary and orthogonal or symplectic

condition on the underlying algebra. Notably, if the algebra has even co-index,
so that it admits a hyperbolic involution, which is unique up to isomorphism,
we get a so-called {\em hyperbolic} Arason invariant. Assuming in addition the

explores an unknown environment and expert policy to quickly learn the expert's

to construct confidence intervals that capture plausible reward functions and
find exploration policies that focus on the most informative regions of the

bounds that does not require a generative model of the environment. AceIRL
matches the sample complexity of active IRL with a generative model in the
worst case. Additionally, we establish a problem-dependent bound that relates
the sample complexity of AceIRL to the suboptimality gap of a given IRL
problem. We empirically evaluate AceIRL in simulations and find that it
significantly outperforms more naive exploration strategies.

increase in observing speed of many orders of magnitude. A spectroscopic
instrument on such an observatory requires large arrays of detectors with a
sensitivity expressed as a noise equivalent power NEP = 3 $\times 10^{-20}$
$W\surd{Hz}$. We present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of
microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) for this frequency range
reaching the required sensitivity. The devices are based on thin-film NbTiN
resonators which use lens-antenna coupling to a submicron-width aluminium
transmission line at the shorted end of the resonator where the radiation is
absorbed. We optimised the MKID geometry for a low NEP by using a small
aluminium volume of $\approx$ 1$\mu m^3$ and fabricating the aluminium section
on a very thin (100 nm) SiN membrane. Both methods of optimisation also reduce
the effect of excess noise by increasing the responsivity of the device, which
is further increased by reducing the parasitic geometrical inductance of the
resonator. We measure the sensitivity of eight MKIDs with respect to the power
absorbed in the detector using a thermal calibration source filtered in a
narrow band around 1.55 THz. We obtain a
NEP$_{exp}(P_{abs})\:=\:3.1\pm0.9\times10^{-20}\:W\surd{Hz}$ at a modulation
frequency of 200 Hz averaged over all measured MKIDs. The NEP is limited by
quasiparticle trapping. The measured sensitivity is sufficient for
spectroscopic observations from future, actively cooled space-based
observatories. Moreover, the presented device design and assembly can be
adapted for frequencies up to $\approx$ 10 THz and can be readily implemented
in kilopixel arrays.

time extrapolating beyond the training set. A recent study by Balestriero et
al. (2021) challenges this view: defining interpolation as the state of
belonging to the convex hull of the training set, they show that the test set,
either in input or neural space, cannot lie for the most part in this convex
hull, due to the high dimensionality of the data, invoking the well known curse
of dimensionality. Neural networks are then assumed to necessarily work in
extrapolative mode. We here study the neural activities of the last hidden
layer of typical neural networks. Using an autoencoder to uncover the intrinsic
space underlying the neural activities, we show that this space is actually
low-dimensional, and that the better the model, the lower the dimensionality of
this intrinsic space. In this space, most samples of the test set actually lie
in the convex hull of the training set: under the convex hull definition, the
models thus happen to work in interpolation regime. Moreover, we show that
belonging to the convex hull does not seem to be the relevant criteria.
Different measures of proximity to the training set are actually better related
to performance accuracy. Thus, typical neural networks do seem to operate in
interpolation regime. Good generalization performances are linked to the
ability of a neural network to operate well in such a regime.

scales relevant for gamma-ray DM searches, a topic subject to intense debate
nowadays. Specifically, we have developed and employed an improved version of
DASH, a GPU $N$-body code, to study the evolution of low-mass subhaloes inside
a Milky Way-like halo with unprecedented accuracy, reaching solar-mass and
sub-parsec resolution in our simulations. We simulate subhaloes with varying
mass, concentration, and orbital properties, and consider the effect of the
gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy itself. More specifically, we
analyze the evolution of both the bound mass fraction and annihilation
luminosity of subhaloes, finding that most subhaloes survive until present
time, even though in some cases they lose more than 99% of their mass at
accretion. Baryons in the host induce a much more severe mass loss, especially
when the subhalo orbit is more parallel to the galactic disk. Many of these
subhaloes cross the solar galactocentric radius, thus making it easier to
detect their annihilation fluxes from Earth. We find subhaloes orbiting a
DM-only halo with a pericentre in the solar vicinity to lose 70-90% of their
initial annihilation luminosity at redshift zero, which increases up to 99%
when baryons are also included in the host. We find a strong relation between
subhalo's mass loss and the effective tidal field at pericentre. Indeed, much
of the dependence on concentration, orbital parameters, host potential and
baryonic components can be explained through this single parameter. In addition
to shedding light on the survival of low-mass galactic subhaloes, our results
can provide detailed predictions that will aid current and future quests for
the nature of DM.

the unlabelled samples learning by imposing the action priors induced from the

actions, which also provides frame-wise classification supervision. In
addition, we propose an Adaptive Boundary Smoothing (ABS) approach to build
coarser action boundaries for more robust and reliable learning. The proposed

research interest in the field of automated intersection management. So far,
mostly non-learning algorithms like reservation or optimization-based ones were
proposed to solve the underlying multi-agent planning problem. At the same
time, automated driving functions for a single ego vehicle are increasingly
implemented using machine learning methods. In this work, we build upon a
previously presented graph-based scene representation and graph neural network
to approach the problem using reinforcement learning. The scene representation
is improved in key aspects by using edge features in addition to the existing
node features for the vehicles. This leads to an increased representation
quality that is leveraged by an updated network architecture. The paper
provides an in-depth evaluation of the proposed method against baselines that
are commonly used in automatic intersection management. Compared to a
traditional signalized intersection and an enhanced first-in-first-out scheme,
a significant reduction of induced delay is observed at varying traffic
densities. Finally, the generalization capability of the graph-based
representation is evaluated by testing the policy on intersection layouts not
seen during training. The model generalizes virtually without restrictions to
smaller intersection layouts and within certain limits to larger ones.

Additionally, unlike previous methods that simply represents the room

two-point correlation functions boils down to solving a second order, ordinary
differential equation on an interval of the real line. Using the language of
Sturm-Liouville theory, most compelling is the scenario when one endpoint of
such interval is classified as a limit circle, as it often happens when one is
working on globally hyperbolic spacetimes with a timelike boundary. In this
case, beyond initial data, one needs to specify a boundary condition both to
have a well-defined classical dynamics and to select a corresponding ground
state. Here, we take into account boundary conditions of Robin type by using
well-known results from Sturm-Liouville theory, but we go beyond the existing
literature by exploring an unnoticed freedom that emerges from the intrinsic
arbitrariness of secondary solutions at a limit circle endpoint. Accordingly,
we show that infinitely many one-parameter families of sensible dynamics are
admissible. In other words, we emphasize that physical constraints guaranteeing
the construction of full-fledged ground states do not, in general, fix one such

interaction, such as in autonomous driving. In this work, we address the
problem of predicting future pedestrian trajectories in a first person view
setting with a moving camera. To that end, we propose a novel action-based
contrastive learning loss, that utilizes pedestrian action information to
improve the learned trajectory embeddings. The fundamental idea behind this new
loss is that trajectories of pedestrians performing the same action should be
closer to each other in the feature space than the trajectories of pedestrians
with significantly different actions. In other words, we argue that behavioral
information about pedestrian action influences their future trajectory.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling strategy for trajectories that is
able to effectively increase negative and positive contrastive samples.
Additional synthetic trajectory samples are generated using a trained
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which is at the core of several
models developed for trajectory prediction. Results show that our proposed
contrastive framework employs contextual information about pedestrian behavior,
i.e. action, effectively, and it learns a better trajectory representation.
Thus, integrating the proposed contrastive framework within a trajectory
prediction model improves its results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on three trajectory prediction benchmarks [31, 32, 26].

to compare the pGMM kernel regression with the ordinary ridge linear regression
as well as the RBF kernel ridge regression. Perhaps surprisingly, even without
a tuning parameter (i.e., $p=1$ for the power parameter of the pGMM kernel),
the pGMM kernel already performs well. Furthermore, by tuning the parameter
$p$, this (deceptively simple) pGMM kernel even performs quite comparably to
boosted trees.
  Boosting and boosted trees are very popular in machine learning practice. For
regression tasks, typically, practitioners use $L_2$ boost, i.e., for
minimizing the $L_2$ loss. Sometimes for the purpose of robustness, the $L_1$
boost might be a choice. In this study, we implement $L_p$ boost for $p\geq 1$
and include it in the package of ``Fast ABC-Boost''. Perhaps also surprisingly,
the best performance (in terms of $L_2$ regression loss) is often attained at
$p>2$, in some cases at $p\gg 2$. This phenomenon has already been demonstrated
by Li et al (UAI 2010) in the context of k-nearest neighbor classification
using $L_p$ distances. In summary, the implementation of $L_p$ boost provides
practitioners the additional flexibility of tuning boosting algorithms for
potentially achieving better accuracy in regression applications.

iii) take into account the uncertainty in the relationship between semi-major

While prior works mainly studied the distribution shift caused by the policy
during the offline training, the problem of recovering from out-of-distribution
states at the deployment time is not very well studied yet. We alleviate the
distributional shift at the deployment time by introducing a recovery policy
that brings the agent back to the training manifold whenever it steps out of
the in-distribution states, e.g., due to an external perturbation. The recovery
policy relies on an approximation of the training data density and a learned
equivariant mapping that maps visual observations into a latent space in which
translations correspond to the robot actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method through several manipulation experiments on a real

linear combination of the functions in the learned family by solving a
PDE-constrained optimization problem. Our method provides continuous solutions
over the domain of interest that accurately satisfy desired physical
constraints. Our results show that incorporating hard constraints directly into
the NN architecture achieves much lower test error when compared to training on
an unconstrained objective.

often exhibit high correlations. Modeling complex relationships between
attributes poses a great challenge for multi-attribute learning. This paper
proposes a simple yet generic framework named Label2Label to exploit the
complex attribute correlations. Label2Label is the first attempt for
multi-attribute prediction from the perspective of language modeling.
Specifically, it treats each attribute label as a ""word"" describing the sample.
As each sample is annotated with multiple attribute labels, these ""words"" will
naturally form an unordered but meaningful ""sentence"", which depicts the
semantic information of the corresponding sample. Inspired by the remarkable
success of pre-training language models in NLP, Label2Label introduces an
image-conditioned masked language model, which randomly masks some of the
""word"" tokens from the label ""sentence"" and aims to recover them based on the
masked ""sentence"" and the context conveyed by image features. Our intuition is
that the instance-wise attribute relations are well grasped if the neural net
can infer the missing attributes based on the context and the remaining
attribute hints. Label2Label is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.
Without incorporating task-specific prior knowledge and highly specialized
network designs, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three
different multi-attribute learning tasks, compared to highly customized
domain-specific methods. Code is available at

constructive version of the classical Daniell approach to measure and
integration, and highly impredicative, as many of its fundamental notions, such
as the integration space of $p$-integrable functions $L^p$, rely on
quantification over proper classes. In this paper we introduce the notions of a
pre-measure and pre-integration space, a predicative variation of the
Bishop-Cheng notion of a measure space and of an integration space,

to represent data distributions. Traditionally, the difference between the
histogram and the underlying distribution (i.e., the approximation error) is
measured using the $L_p$ norm, which sums the differences between the two
functions over all items in the domain. Although useful in many applications,
the drawback of this error measure is that it treats approximation errors of
all items in the same way, irrespective of whether the mass of an item is
important for the downstream application that uses the approximation. As a
result, even relatively simple distributions cannot be approximated by succinct
histograms without incurring large error.
  In this paper, we address this issue by adapting the definition of
approximation so that only the errors of the items that belong to the support
of the distribution are considered. Under this definition, we develop efficient
1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms that compute near-optimal histograms in
sub-linear space. We also present lower bounds on the space complexity of this
problem. Surprisingly, under this notion of error, there is an exponential gap
in the space complexity of 1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of our algorithms on a collection of real and synthetic

asymptotic behavior of the URC is consistent with that of the most probable

analysis of these stationary solutions is also done, and we find them to be

field built around the concept of solvable terms, which are elegantly
characterized in many different ways. In particular, unsolvable terms provide a
consistent notion of meaningless term. The semantics of the untyped
call-by-value lambda-calculus (CbV) is instead still in its infancy, because of
some inherent difficulties but also because CbV solvable terms are less studied
and understood than in call-by-name. On the one hand, we show that a carefully
crafted presentation of CbV allows us to recover many of the properties that
solvability has in call-by-name, in particular qualitative and quantitative
characterizations via multi types. On the other hand, we stress that, in CbV,
solvability plays a different role: identifying unsolvable terms as meaningless
induces an inconsistent theory.

interconversion through the direct and inverse Edelstein effects. Notably,

However, a direct visualization of the Rashba-split bands in oxide 2DEGs is

bring insight into the complex multiorbital nature of the band structure. Our
calculations reveal unconventional spin and orbital textures, showing
compensation effects from quasi-degenerate band pairs which strongly depend on

data. This task is particularly relevant in safety-critical applications, such
as autonomous driving or healthcare, where it is crucial to recognize unknown
objects at deployment time and issue a warning to the user accordingly. Despite
the impressive advancements of deep learning research, existing models still
need a finetuning stage on the known categories in order to recognize the
unknown ones. This could be prohibitive when privacy rules limit data access,
or in case of strict memory and computational constraints (e.g. edge
computing). We claim that a tailored representation learning strategy may be
the right solution for effective and efficient semantic novelty detection.
Besides extensively testing state-of-the-art approaches for this task, we
propose a novel representation learning paradigm based on relational reasoning.
It focuses on learning how to measure semantic similarity rather than
recognizing known categories. Our experiments show that this knowledge is
directly transferable to a wide range of scenarios, and it can be exploited as
a plug-and-play module to convert closed-set recognition models into reliable
open-set ones.

of weight zero induces a bialgebra structure of independent interest, namely
the special L-dendriform bialgebra, which is equivalent to a Lie group with a

transform into strange quark matter because of the Coulomb barrier separating
the two components. On the other hand, ordinary matter can be transformed into
strange quark matter if the star undergoes a violent process, as in the
preliminary stages of a type Ia supernova, and this causes the system to become
unstable and to collapse into a strange quark star. In this way, accretion
induced collapse of strange dwarfs can be facilitated and km-sized objects with

one loop approximation is known to have a minimum below zero which results in a
spontaneously generated magnetic field. However, this minimum is not stable;
the effective action has an imaginary part. Over the past decades, there were
many attempts to handle this situation which all were at some point
unsatisfactory. I propose an idea for a new solution by assuming that the
tachyonic mode, at low temperature, acquires a condensate and, as a result,
undergoes a phase transition like in the Higgs model. I consider the
approximation where all gluon modes are dropped except for the tachyonic one.
For this mode, we have a O(2)-model with quartic self-interaction in two
dimensions. I apply the CJT (2PI) formalism in the Hartree approximation. As a
result, at zero and low temperatures, a minimum of the effective action at a
certain value of the condensate and of the background fields is observed and
there is no imaginary part. Raising the temperature, this minimum becomes
shallower and at a critical temperature, the perturbative state becomes that
with lower effective potential; the symmetry is restored. The physical
interpretation says that the unstable mode creates tachyons until these come
into equilibrium with their repulsive self-interaction and form a condensate.
The relation to the Mermin-Wagner theorem is discussed. }

the first analytic examples of hadronic crystals at finite baryon density in

theory are constructed. These configurations have arbitrary topological charge
and describe crystals of baryonic tubes surrounded by a cloud of vector-mesons.
In the $\omega$-mesons case, it is possible to reduce consistently the complete
set of seven coupled non-linear field equations to just two integrable
differential equations; one ODE for the Skyrmion profile and one PDE for the
$\omega$-mesons field. This analytical construction allows to show explicitly
how the inclusion of $\omega$-mesons in the Skyrme model reduces the repulsive
interaction energy between baryons. In the Skyrme $\rho$-mesons case, it is
possible to construct analytical solutions using a meron-type ansatz and fixing
one of the couplings of the $\rho$-mesons action in terms of the others. We
show that, quite remarkably, the values obtained for the coupling constants by
requiring the consistency of our ansatz are very close to the values used in
the literature to reduce nuclei binding energies of the Skyrme model without

between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). Machines
are being integrated with connected sensors and managed by intelligent
analytics applications, accelerating digital transformation and business
operations. Bringing Machine Learning (ML) to industrial devices is an
advancement aiming to promote the convergence of IT and OT. However, developing
an ML application in industrial IoT (IIoT) presents various challenges,
including hardware heterogeneity, non-standardized representations of ML
models, device and ML model compatibility issues, and slow application
development. Successful deployment in this area requires a deep understanding
of hardware, algorithms, software tools, and applications. Therefore, this
paper presents a framework called Semantic Low-Code Engineering for ML
Applications (SeLoC-ML), built on a low-code platform to support the rapid
development of ML applications in IIoT by leveraging Semantic Web technologies.
SeLoC-ML enables non-experts to easily model, discover, reuse, and matchmake ML
models and devices at scale. The project code can be automatically generated
for deployment on hardware based on the matching results. Developers can
benefit from semantic application templates, called recipes, to fast prototype
end-user applications. The evaluations confirm an engineering effort reduction
by a factor of at least three compared to traditional approaches on an
industrial ML classification case study, showing the efficiency and usefulness
of SeLoC-ML. We share the code and welcome any contributions.

Scheepers (${\sf aS}$), weakly Scheepers in the sense of Sakai (${\sf wS}$) and
weakly Scheepers in the sense of Ko\v{c}inac (${\sf wS_k}$). We explore many
topological properties of the weaker forms of the Scheepers property and
present few illustrative examples to make distinction between these spaces.
Certain situations are considered when all the weaker forms are equivalent. We
also make investigations on the weak variations as considered in this paper
concerning cardinalities. In particular we observe that
  1. If every finite power of a space $X$ is ${\sf aM}$ (respectively, ${\sf
wM}$), then $X$ is ${\sf aS}$ (respectively, ${\sf wS}$).
  2. Every almost Lindel\""{o}f space of cardinality less than $\mathfrak{d}$ is
${\sf aS}$.
  3. Let $X$ be Lindel\""{o}f and $\kappa<\mathfrak d$. If $X$ is a union of
$\kappa$ many ${\sf aH}$ (respectively, ${\sf wH}$, ${\sf wH_k}$) spaces, then
$X$ is ${\sf aS}$ (respectively, ${\sf wS}$, ${\sf wS_k}$).
  4. The Alexandroff duplicate $AD(X)$ of a space $X$ has the Scheepers
property if and only if $AD(X)$ has the ${\sf wS_k}$ property.
  5. If $AD(X)$ is ${\sf aS}$ (respectively, ${\sf wS}$), then $X$ is also
${\sf aS}$ (respectively, ${\sf wS}$).
  Besides, few observations on productively ${\sf aS}$, productively ${\sf wS}$
and productively ${\sf wS_k}$ spaces are presented. Some open problems are also
given.

another speech corpus. To address this challenge, a Capsule Network (CapsNet)

both the singlecorpus and cross-corpus SER tasks simultaneously in this paper.
For the single-corpus task, the combination of Convolution-Pooling and
Attention CapsNet module CPAC) is designed by embedding the self-attention
mechanism to the CapsNet, guiding the module to focus on the important features
that can be fed into different capsules. The extracted high-level features by
CPAC provide sufficient discriminative ability. Furthermore, to handle the
cross-corpus task, CTL-MTNet employs a Corpus Adaptation Adversarial Module
(CAAM) by combining CPAC with Margin Disparity Discrepancy (MDD), which can
learn the domain-invariant emotion representations through extracting the
strong emotion commonness. Experiments including ablation studies and
visualizations on both singleand cross-corpus tasks using four well-known SER
datasets in different languages are conducted for performance evaluation and

previous studies only provide alerts when attacks occur without knowing the

multiple attack identification on the CAN bus. Furthermore, the model can be
used to improve the performance of a limited-size dataset using a transfer

real car datasets. When tested with the car hacking dataset, the experiment
results show that the SupCon ResNet model improves the overall false-negative

essence, a hierarchical patch-GAN that applies quantization at the first coarse
scale, in a similar fashion to VQ-GAN, followed by a pyramid of residual fully
convolutional GANs at finer scales. Our key idea is to first use quantization
to learn a fixed set of patch embeddings for training images. We then use a
separate set of side images to model the structure of generated images using an
autoregressive model trained on the learned patch embeddings of training
images. Using quantization at the coarsest scale allows the model to generate

inexpensive method of estimating air pollution concentrations to an accuracy
level that can underpin policymakers' decisions while providing an estimate in
all districts, not just urban areas, and in a process that is transparent and
explainable. Impact Statement. We show that a linear regression model using a
single structural property -- length of the track and unclassified road network
within 0.36% of districts within England and Wales (in the UK) -- can
accurately estimate which districts are the most polluted. The model presents a
transparent and low-cost, yet effective, alternative to more expensive models
such as the one currently used by DEFRA in the UK. The model has apparent
practical uses for policymakers who want to pursue clean-air initiatives but
lack the capital to invest in comprehensive monitoring networks. Its low
implementation cost, accessible model design, and worldwide coverage of the

  ML-enabled Surrogate Model","4 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1016/j.sse.2022.108468",,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, two methodologies are used to speed up the maximization of the
breakdown volt-age (BV) of a vertical GaN diode that has a theoretical maximum
BV of ~2100V. Firstly, we demonstrated a 5X faster accurate simulation method
in Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD). This allows us to find 50% more
numbers of high BV (>1400V) designs at a given simulation time. Secondly, a
machine learning (ML) model is developed using TCAD-generated data and used as
a surrogate model for differential evolution optimization. It can inversely
design an out-of-the-training-range structure with BV as high as 1887V (89% of
the ideal case) compared to ~1100V designed with human domain expertise.

learners, which requires sophisticated system-level coordination of diverse
tasks, including modeling learning resources, estimating student states, and
making personalized recommendations. Existing deep learning methods have
achieved great success over statistical models; however, they still lack
generalization for diverse tasks and suffer from insufficient capacity since
they are composed of highly-coupled task-specific architectures and rely on
small-scale, coarse-grained recommendation scenarios. To realize the idea of
general adaptive systems proposed in pedagogical theory, with the emerging
pre-training techniques in NLP, we try to conduct a practical exploration on
applying pre-training to adaptive learning, to propose a unified framework
based on data observation and learning style analysis, properly leveraging
heterogeneous learning elements. Through a series of downstream tasks of
Learning Recommendation, Learning Resource Evaluation, Knowledge Tracing, and
Dropout Prediction, we find that course structures, text, and knowledge are
helpful for modeling and inherently coherent to student non-sequential learning
behaviors and that indirectly relevant information included in the pre-training
foundation can be shared across downstream tasks to facilitate effectiveness.
We finally build a simplified systematic application of adaptive learning and
reflect on the insights brought back to pedagogy. The source code and dataset
will be released.

"2209.03956","John Rushby","John Rushby and Daniel Sanchez","Technology and Consciousness","SRI CSL Workshop Report 2017-1",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We report on a series of eight workshops held in the summer of 2017 on the
topic ""technology and consciousness."" The workshops covered many subjects but
the overall goal was to assess the possibility of machine consciousness, and
its potential implications. In the body of the report, we summarize most of the
basic themes that were discussed: the structure and function of the brain,
theories of consciousness, explicit attempts to construct conscious machines,
detection and measurement of consciousness, possible emergence of a conscious
technology, methods for control of such a technology and ethical considerations
that might be owed to it. An appendix outlines the topics of each workshop and
provides abstracts of the talks delivered.
  Update: Although this report was published in 2018 and the workshops it is
based on were held in 2017, recent events suggest that it is worth bringing
forward. In particular, in the Spring of 2022, a Google engineer claimed that
LaMDA, one of their ""large language models"" is sentient or even conscious. This
provoked a flurry of commentary in both the scientific and popular press, some
of it interesting and insightful, but almost all of it ignorant of the prior
consideration given to these topics and the history of research into machine
consciousness. Thus, we are making a lightly refreshed version of this report
available in the hope that it will provide useful background to the current
debate and will enable more informed commentary. Although this material is five
years old, its technical points remain valid and up to date, but we have
""refreshed"" it by adding a few footnotes highlighting recent developments.
