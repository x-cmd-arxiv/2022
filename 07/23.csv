representation learning without human annotations. The dominant method -- that
is contrastive learning, is generally based on instance discrimination tasks,
i.e., individual samples are treated as independent categories. However,
presuming all the samples are different contradicts the natural grouping of
similar samples in common visual datasets, e.g., multiple views of the same
dog. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes an adaptive method that introduces
soft inter-sample relations, namely Adaptive Soft Contrastive Learning (ASCL).
More specifically, ASCL transforms the original instance discrimination task
into a multi-instance soft discrimination task, and adaptively introduces
inter-sample relations. As an effective and concise plug-in module for existing
self-supervised learning frameworks, ASCL achieves the best performance on
several benchmarks in terms of both performance and efficiency. Code is

identifiable, while making no assumptions on the mixture components, so long as
one has access to groups of samples of size $2m-1$ which are known to come from
the same mixture component. In this work we generalize that result and show
that, if every subset of $k$ mixture components of a mixture model are linearly
independent, then that mixture model is identifiable with only $(2m-1)/(k-1)$
samples per group. We further show that this value cannot be improved. We prove
an analogous result for a stronger form of identifiability known as
""determinedness"" along with a corresponding lower bound. This independence
assumption almost surely holds if mixture components are chosen randomly from a
$k$-dimensional space. We describe some implications of our results for
multinomial mixture models and topic modeling.

evaluation needs to reflect the broad applications. We propose a Multi-dOmain
Few-Shot Object Detection (MoFSOD) benchmark consisting of 10 datasets from a
wide range of domains to evaluate FSOD algorithms. We comprehensively analyze
the impacts of freezing layers, different architectures, and different
pre-training datasets on FSOD performance. Our empirical results show several
key factors that have not been explored in previous works: 1) contrary to
previous belief, on a multi-domain benchmark, fine-tuning (FT) is a strong
baseline for FSOD, performing on par or better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
algorithms; 2) utilizing FT as the baseline allows us to explore multiple
architectures, and we found them to have a significant impact on down-stream
few-shot tasks, even with similar pre-training performances; 3) by decoupling
pre-training and few-shot learning, MoFSOD allows us to explore the impact of
different pre-training datasets, and the right choice can boost the performance
of the down-stream tasks significantly. Based on these findings, we list
possible avenues of investigation for improving FSOD performance and propose
two simple modifications to existing algorithms that lead to SOTA performance

we propose to learn three types of class-agnostic commonalities between base
and novel classes explicitly: recognition-related semantic commonalities,
localization-related semantic commonalities and distribution commonalities. We
design a unified distillation framework based on a memory bank, which is able
to perform distillation of all three types of commonalities jointly and
efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can be readily
integrated into most of existing fine-tuning based methods and consistently
improve the performance by a large margin.

Prior work on robotic manipulation of cloth relies primarily on vision sensors

grasping a desired number of cloth layers from a stack of cloth. In this paper,
we propose to use tactile sensing for cloth manipulation; we attach a tactile

classifier to determine whether the robot is grasping a specific number of
cloth layers. During test-time experiments, the robot uses this classifier as
part of its policy to grasp one or two cloth layers using tactile feedback to
determine suitable grasping points. Experimental results over 180 physical

  Case Study in Inferential Model Selection","56 pages, 8 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Variational inference has recently emerged as a popular alternative to the
classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in large-scale Bayesian inference.
The core idea of variational inference is to trade statistical accuracy for
computational efficiency. It aims to approximate the posterior, reducing
computation costs but potentially compromising its statistical accuracy. In
this work, we study this statistical and computational trade-off in variational
inference via a case study in inferential model selection. Focusing on Gaussian
inferential models (a.k.a. variational approximating families) with diagonal
plus low-rank precision matrices, we initiate a theoretical study of the
trade-offs in two aspects, Bayesian posterior inference error and frequentist
uncertainty quantification error. From the Bayesian posterior inference
perspective, we characterize the error of the variational posterior relative to
the exact posterior. We prove that, given a fixed computation budget, a
lower-rank inferential model produces variational posteriors with a higher
statistical approximation error, but a lower computational error; it reduces
variances in stochastic optimization and, in turn, accelerates convergence.
From the frequentist uncertainty quantification perspective, we consider the
precision matrix of the variational posterior as an uncertainty estimate. We
find that, relative to the true asymptotic precision, the variational
approximation suffers from an additional statistical error originating from the
sampling uncertainty of the data. Moreover, this statistical error becomes the
dominant factor as the computation budget increases. As a consequence, for
small datasets, the inferential model need not be full-rank to achieve optimal
estimation error. We finally demonstrate these statistical and computational
trade-offs inference across empirical studies, corroborating the theoretical
findings.

understanding. Most SOTAs adopt distance clustering, which is typically
effective but does not perform well in segmenting adjacent objects with the
same semantic label (especially when they share neighboring points). Due to the
uneven distribution of offset points, these existing methods can hardly cluster
all instance points. To this end, we design a novel divide-and-conquer strategy
named PBNet that binarizes each point and clusters them separately to segment
instances. Our binary clustering divides offset instance points into two
categories: high and low density points (HPs vs. LPs). Adjacent objects can be
clearly separated by removing LPs, and then be completed and refined by
assigning LPs via a neighbor voting method. To suppress potential
over-segmentation, we propose to construct local scenes with the weight mask
for each instance. As a plug-in, the proposed binary clustering can replace the
traditional distance clustering and lead to consistent performance gains on
many mainstream baselines. A series of experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets indicate the superiority of our model. In particular, PBNet ranks
first on the ScanNetV2 official benchmark challenge, achieving the highest mAP.

spherical blobs and the pair-wise interaction between blobs is described by the
RPY-tensor. The paper aims to investigate and improve on the magnitude of the
error in the solution velocities of the Stokes mobility problem using a
combination of two different techniques: an optimally chosen grid of blobs and
a pair-correction inspired by Stokesian dynamics. Optimisation strategies to
determine a grid with a certain number of blobs are presented with the aim of
matching the hydrodynamic response of a single accurately described ideal
particle, alone in the fluid. Small errors in this self-interaction are
essential as they determine the basic error level in a system of well-separated
particles. With a good match, reasonable accuracy can be obtained even with
coarse blob-resolutions of the particle surfaces. The error in the
self-interaction is however sensitive to the exact choice of grid parameters
and simply hand-picking a suitable blob geometry can lead to errors several
orders of magnitude larger in size. The pair-correction is local and cheap to
apply, and reduces on the error for more closely interacting particles. Two
different types of geometries are considered: spheres and axisymmetric rods
with smooth caps. The error in solutions to mobility problems is quantified for
particles of varying inter-particle distances for systems containing a few
particles, comparing to an accurate solution based on a second kind
BIE-formulation where the quadrature error is controlled by employing
quadrature by expansion (QBX).

gravitons and of the KK gravitational Goldstone bosons in the compactified 5d
General Relativity (GR). Using a general $R_{\xi}$ gauge-fixing, we study the
geometric Higgs mechanism for the massive spin-2 KK gravitons. We newly propose
and prove a Gravitational Equivalence Theorem (GRET) to connect the scattering
amplitudes of longitudinal KK gravitons to that of the KK gravitational
Goldstone bosons, which formulates the geometric gravitational Higgs mechanism
at the scattering $S$-matrix level. We demonstrate that the GRET provides a
general energy-cancellation mechanism guaranteeing the $N$-point longitudinal
KK graviton scattering amplitudes to have their leading energy dependence
cancelled down by a large power factor of $E^{2N}$ ($N \geq 4$) up to any loop
order. We propose an extended double-copy approach to construct the massive KK
graviton (Goldstone) amplitudes from the KK gauge boson (Goldstone) amplitudes.
With these we establish a new correspondence between the two types of energy
cancellations in the four-point longitudinal KK amplitudes at tree level:
$E^4\to E^0$ in the KK gauge theory and $E^{10} \to E^2$ in the KK GR theory.

  JHEP",,"10.1007/JHEP02(2023)196",,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A reheating phase in the early universe is an essential part of all
inflationary models during which not only the Standard Model (SM) quanta are
produced but it can also shed light on the production of dark matter. In this
work, we explore a class of reheating models where the reheating is induced by
a cubic interaction of the inflaton $\phi$ to the SM Higgs boson ${\textbf h}$
of the form $g_{h\phi} M_{\rm Pl} \phi |{\textbf h}|^2$ adopting the
$\alpha$-attractor T-model of inflation. Assuming inflaton as a background
field such interaction implies a $\phi$-dependent mass term of the Higgs boson
and a non-trivial phase-space suppression of the reheating efficiency. As a
consequence, the reheating is prolonged and the maximal temperature of the SM
thermal bath is reduced. In particular, due to oscillations of the inflaton
field the $\phi$-dependent Higgs boson mass results in periodic transitions
between phases of broken and unbroken electroweak gauge symmetry. The
consequences of these rapid phase transitions have been studied in detail. A
purely gravitational reheating mechanism in the presence of the inflaton
background, i.e., for $g_{h\phi}=0$, has also been investigated. It turned out
that even though it may account for the total production of SM radiation in the
absence of $g_{h\phi}$, its contribution to the reheating is subdominant for
the range of $g_{h\phi}$ considered in this work. As a dark matter candidate, a
massive Abelian vector boson, $X_\mu$, has been considered. Various production
mechanisms of $X_\mu$ have been discussed including (i) purely gravitational
production from the inflaton background, (ii) gravitational freeze-in from the
SM quanta, (iii) inflaton decay through a dim-5 effective operator, and (iv)
Higgs portal freeze-in and Higgs decay through a dim-6 effective operator.
Parameters that properly describe the observed relic abundance have been
determined.

topologically heterogeneous group of cities and simulate the network loading

At departure, vehicles are aware of the network state and choose paths with
optimal traversal time. Each added path modifies the vehicular density and
travel times for the following vehicles. Starting from an empty network and
adding traffic until transportation collapses, provides a framework to study
network's transition to congestion and how connectivity is progressively
disrupted as the fraction of impossible paths becomes abruptly dominant. We use
standard BC to probe into the instantaneous out-of-equilibrium network state
for a range of traffic levels and show how this measure may be improved to
build a better proxy for cumulative road usage during peak-hours. We define a
novel dynamical measure to estimate cumulative road usage and the associated
total time spent over the edges by the population of drivers. We also study how
congestion starts with dysfunctional edges scattered over the network, then
organizes itself into relatively small, but disruptive clusters.

allows us to understand how errors in a diagnostic quantity of interest (QoI),
or goal, occur and accumulate in a numerical approximation, for example using
the finite element method. By decomposing the error estimates into
contributions from individual elements, it is possible to formulate adaptation
methods, which modify the mesh with the objective of minimising the resulting
QoI error. However, the standard error estimate formulation involves the true
adjoint solution, which is unknown in practice. As such, it is common practice
to approximate it with an 'enriched' approximation (e.g. in a higher order
space or on a refined mesh). Doing so generally results in a significant
increase in computational cost, which can be a bottleneck compromising the
competitiveness of (goal-oriented) adaptive simulations. The central idea of
this paper is to develop a ""data-driven"" goal-oriented mesh adaptation approach
through the selective replacement of the expensive error estimation step with
an appropriately configured and trained neural network. In doing so, the error
estimator may be obtained without even constructing the enriched spaces. An
element-by-element construction is employed here, whereby local values of
various parameters related to the mesh geometry and underlying problem physics
are taken as inputs, and the corresponding contribution to the error estimator
is taken as output. We demonstrate that this approach is able to obtain the
same accuracy with a reduced computational cost, for adaptive mesh test cases
related to flow around tidal turbines, which interact via their downstream
wakes, and where the overall power output of the farm is taken as the QoI.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the element-by-element approach implies
reasonably low training costs.

are i.i.d. and labeled data is abundant. Challenges emerge with non-stationary
training data streams such as continual learning. One powerful approach that
has addressed this challenge involves pre-training of large encoders on volumes
of readily available data, followed by task-specific tuning. Given a new task,
however, updating the weights of these encoders is challenging as a large
number of weights needs to be fine-tuned, and as a result, they forget
information about the previous tasks. In the present work, we propose a model
architecture to address this issue, building upon a discrete bottleneck
containing pairs of separate and learnable key-value codes. Our paradigm will
be to encode; process the representation via a discrete bottleneck; and decode.
Here, the input is fed to the pre-trained encoder, the output of the encoder is
used to select the nearest keys, and the corresponding values are fed to the
decoder to solve the current task. The model can only fetch and re-use a sparse
number of these key-value pairs during inference, enabling localized and
context-dependent model updates. We theoretically investigate the ability of
the discrete key-value bottleneck to minimize the effect of learning under
distribution shifts and show that it reduces the complexity of the hypothesis
class. We empirically verify the proposed method under challenging
class-incremental learning scenarios and show that the proposed model - without
any task boundaries - reduces catastrophic forgetting across a wide variety of
pre-trained models, outperforming relevant baselines on this task.

ionizing photon sinks played in reionization. Accurately modeling the sinks in
reionization simulations is challenging because of the large dynamic range
required if $\sim 10^4-10^8 M_{\odot}$ gas structures contributed significant
opacity. Thus, there is no consensus on how important the sinks were in shaping
reionization's morphology. We address this question with a recently developed
radiative transfer code that includes a dynamical sub-grid model for the sinks
based on radiative hydrodynamics simulations. Compared to assuming a fully
pressure-smoothed IGM, our dynamical treatment reduces ionized bubble sizes by
$10-20\%$ under typical assumptions about reionization's sources. Near
reionization's midpoint, the 21 cm power at $k \sim 0.1$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$ is
similarly reduced. These effects are more modest than the $30-60\%$ suppression
resulting from the higher recombination rate if pressure smoothing is neglected
entirely. Whether the sinks played a significant role in reionization's
morphology depends on the nature of its sources. For example, if reionization
was driven by bright ($M_{\rm UV} < -17$) galaxies, the sinks reduce the
large-scale 21 cm power by at most $20\%$, even if pressure smoothing is
neglected. Conveniently, when bright sources contribute significantly, the
morphology in our dynamical treatment can be reproduced accurately with a
uniform sub-grid clumping factor that yields the same ionizing photon budget.
By contrast, if $M_{\rm UV} \sim -13$ galaxies drove reionization, the uniform
clumping model can err by up to $40\%$.

large curvature regime is gravitational spectroscopy: the measurement of black
hole quasi-normal modes from the ringdown signal emitted in the aftermath of a
compact binary coalescence, searching for deviations from the predictions of
general relativity. This strategy is only effective if we know how quasi-normal
modes of black holes are affected by modifications of general relativity; and
if we know this for rotating black holes, since binary coalescences typically
lead to black holes with spins $J/M^2\sim 0.7$. In this article, we compute for
the first time the gravitational quasi-normal modes of rotating black holes up
to second order in the spin in a modified gravity theory. We consider
Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity, one of the simplest theories which
modifies the large-curvature regime of gravity and which can be tested with
black hole observations. To enhance the domain of validity of the spin
expansion, we perform a Pad\'e resummation of the quasi-normal modes. We find
that when the second order in spin is not included, the effect of gravity
modifications may be seriously underestimated. A comparison with the general
relativistic case suggests that this approach should be accurate up to spins
$\sim 0.7$; therefore, our results can be used in the data analysis of ringdown

applications of quantum computers. Multi-Product Formulas (MPFs) are well
suited to replace standard product formulas since they scale better with

first proposed in a fully quantum setting using a linear combination of
unitaries. Here, we analyze and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical approach
to MPFs that classically combines expectation values evaluated with a quantum
computer. This has the same approximation bounds as the fully quantum MPFs,
but, in contrast, requires no additional qubits, no controlled operations, and
is not probabilistic. We show how to design MPFs that do not amplify the
hardware and sampling errors, and demonstrate their performance. In particular,
we illustrate the potential of our work by theoretically analyzing the benefits
when applied to a classically intractable spin-boson model, and by computing
the dynamics of the transverse field Ising model using a classical simulator as
well as quantum hardware. We observe an error reduction of up to an order of
magnitude when compared to a product formula approach by suppressing hardware
noise with Pauli Twirling, pulse efficient transpilation, and a novel
zero-noise extrapolation based on scaled cross-resonance pulses. The MPF
methodology reduces the circuit depth and may therefore represent an important
step towards quantum advantage for Hamiltonian simulation on noisy hardware.

thermalize in the early universe on the one hand, and a small enough Yukawa
coupling such that they are stable on cosmological scales on the other. We
solve this problem by implementing varying Yukawa couplings. We achieve this by
using a three-sterile neutrino seesaw extension to the SM and embedding it in a
Froggatt-Nielsen model with a single flavon. Because the vev of the flavon
changes during the electroweak phase transition, the effective Yukawa couplings
of the fermions have different values before and after the phase transition,
thus allowing for successful dark matter genesis. Additionally, the hierarchy
in the flavour structure is alleviated and the origin of the light neutrino
masses are explained by the interplay of the seesaw and Froggatt-Nielsen

regulated by their feedback on the surrounding gas. While radiative feedback
has been extensively studied, the role of mechanical feedback has received
comparatively less scrutiny to date. Here we use high-resolution parsec-scale
hydrodynamical simulations to study jet propagation and its effect on BH
accretion onto 100 ${\rm M_\odot}$ BHs in the dense, low-metallicity gas
expected in early protogalaxies. As the jet propagates, it shocks the
surrounding gas and forms a jet cocoon. The cocoon consists of a
rapidly-cooling cold phase at the interface with the background gas and an
over-pressured subsonic phase of reverse shock-heated gas filling the cocoon
interior. We systematically vary the background gas density and temperature, BH
feedback efficiency, and the jet model. We found that the jet cocoon width
roughly follows a scaling derived by assuming momentum conservation in the jet
propagation direction, and energy conservation in the lateral directions.
Depending on the assumed gas and jet properties, the cocoon either stays
elongated out to a large radius or isotropizes before reaching the Bondi
radius, forming a nearly spherical bubble. Lower jet velocities and higher
background gas densities result in self-regulation to higher momentum fluxes
and elongated cocoons. In all cases, the outward momentum flux of the cocoon
balances the inward momentum flux of the inflowing gas near the Bondi radius,
which ultimately regulates BH accretion. The larger the distance the jet cocoon
reaches, the longer the variability timescale of the BH accretion rate.
Overall, the average accretion rate always remains below the Bondi rate, and
exceeds the Eddington rate only if the ambient medium is dense and cold, and/or
the jet is weak. We derive the combination of jet and ambient gas parameters
yielding super-Eddington growth.

The cloud sectors are rendered purely virtual, to ensure that they do not
propagate extra degrees of freedom. The off-shell, diagrammatic version of the
optical theorem holds, and the extended theory is unitary. The one-loop
two-point functions of the dressed quarks and gluons are calculated. Their
absorptive parts are gauge independent, cloud independent and positive (while

arise in this context, where calculations are more complicated and involve more
stringent requirements on accuracy compared to single-point energy
calculations. In this work, we introduce a technique to improve the performance
of variational quantum circuits calculating energy derivatives. The method,
which we refer to as tailgating, is an adaptive procedure that selects gates
based on their gradient with respect to the expectation value of Hamiltonian
derivatives. These gates are then added at the end of a quantum circuit
originally designed to calculate ground- or excited-state energies. A
distinguishing feature of this approach is that the appended gates do not need
to be optimized: their parameters can be set to zero and varied only for the
purpose of computing energy derivatives, via calculating derivatives with
respect to circuit parameters. We support the validity of this method by
establishing sufficient conditions for a circuit to compute accurate energy
gradients. This is achieved through a connection between energy derivatives and
eigenstates of Taylor approximations of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the
advantages of the tailgating approach by performing simulations calculating the
vibrational modes of beryllium hydride and water: quantities that depend on

  Implications for Axion Miniclusters and Early Matter Domination","to be submit to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many theories of dark matter beyond the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMP) paradigm feature an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales,
leading to the formation of dense dark matter minihaloes. Future local
observations are promising to search for and constrain such substructures. The
survival probability of these dense minihaloes in the Milky Way environment is
crucial for interpreting local observations. In this work, we investigate two
environmental effects: stellar disruption and (smooth) tidal disruption. These
two mechanisms are studied using semi-analytic models and idealized N-body
simulations. For stellar disruption, we perform a series of N-body simulations
of isolated minihalo-star encounters to test and calibrate analytic models of
stellar encounters before applying the model to the realistic Milky Way disk
environment. For tidal disruption, we perform N-body simulations to confirm the
effectiveness of the analytic treatment. Finally, we propose a framework to
combine the hierarchical assembly and infall of minihaloes to the Milky Way
with the late-time disruption mechanisms. We make predictions for the mass
functions of minihaloes in the Milky Way. The survival fraction of dense dark
matter minihaloes, e.g. for axion miniclusters and minihaloes from Early Matter
Domination, is $\sim 60\%$ with the relatively low-mass, compact population
surviving. The survival fraction is insensitive to the detailed model
parameters. We discuss various implications of the framework and future direct
detection prospects.

simulation from the IllustrisTNG project using the 3D multi-frequency radiative
transfer code CRASH. Our work covers the stellar mass range $10^6 \lesssim
M_\star/{\rm M_\odot} \lesssim 10^8$ at redshifts $6 < z < 10$. Adopting an
unresolved, cloud-scale escape fraction parameter of unity, the halo escape
fraction $f_{\rm esc}$ increases with mass from $\sim 0.3$ at $M_\star =
10^6$M$_\odot$ to $\sim 0.6$ at $M_\star = 10^{7.5}$M$_\odot$, after which we
find hints of a turnover and decreasing escape fractions for even more massive
galaxies. However, we demonstrate a strong and non-linear dependence of $f_{\rm
esc}$ on the adopted sub-grid escape fraction. In addition, $f_{\rm esc}$ has
significant scatter at fixed mass, driven by diversity in the ionizing photon
rate together with a complex relationship between (stellar) source positions
and the underling density distribution. The global emissivity is consistent
with observations for reasonable cloud-scale absorption values, and halos with
a stellar mass $\lesssim 10^{7.5}$M$_\odot$ contribute the majority of ionizing
photons at all redshifts. Incorporating dust reduces $f_{\rm esc}$ by a few
percent at $M_\star \lesssim 10^{6.5}$M$_\odot$, and up to 10\% for larger
halos. Our multi-frequency approach shows that $f_{\rm esc}$ depends on photon
energy, and is reduced substantially at $E>54.4$eV versus lower energies. This
suggests that the impact of high energy photons from binary stars is reduced
when accounting for an energy dependent escape fraction.

circuits and organismic functions they subserve is one of the major challenges
in contemporary Neuroscience. Formation of structurally connected modules of
neurons enacts the conversion from single-cell firing to large-scale behaviour
of an organism, highlighting the importance of their accurate profiling in the
data. While connectomes are typically characterized by significant sparsity of
neuronal connections, recent advances in network theory and machine learning
have revealed fundamental limitations of traditionally used community detection
approaches in cases where the network is sparse. Here we studied the optimal
community structure in the structural connectome of C.elegans, for which we
exploited a non-conventional approach that is based on non-backtracking random
walks, virtually eliminating the sparsity issue. In full agreement with the
previous asymptotic results, we demonstrated that non-backtracking walks
resolve the ground true annotation into clusters on stochastic block models
(SBM) with the size and density of the connectome better than the spectral
methods related to simple random walks. Based on the cluster detectability
threshold, we determined that the optimal number of modules in the connectome
of C.elegans is seven, which, surprisingly, further provides the best agreement
with the anatomical partition (the so-called ganglia). The discovered
communities have a clear interpretation in terms of their functional role,
which allows us to discern three groups of structural clusters in the worm: the
brain group, movement controller, and information flow connector. Thus, our
work provides a robust network-based framework to reveal mesoscopic structures

its magnetic ground state. In this paper, we investigate the structural and

Our findings show that orbital ordering leads to a variation in distance

small, trigger different (ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic) exchange
couplings so that the ground state consists of ferromagnetically aligned zigzag

inductive loop sensors, roadside cameras, and crowdsourcing data from massive
urban travelers (e.g., Google Map). These data have the drawbacks of high
costs, limited coverage, or low reliability due to insufficient user
penetration. This study investigates an innovative approach of drive-by
sensing, which leverages large-scale ridesourcing vehicles (RVs) to monitor and
infer the states of urban road networks. With RV traversing over road networks,
we examine the RV fleet sensing performance based on the unique number of road
segments explicitly visited, the sensing reliability as a result of repeated
visits, and the information that can be implicitly inferred given explicit data
and road network topology. We propose an optimal rerouting model to
simultaneously maximize the sensing coverage and sensing reliability, which can
be efficiently solved using a heuristic algorithm to guide the cruising
trajectory of unoccupied RVs sequentially. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, comprehensive experiments and sensitivity analyses are
performed using real-world RV data of more than 20,000 vehicles in New York
City (NYC). Our approach is shown to cover up to 75.5% of all road segments,
which leads to an implicit coverage of 97.2%. More importantly, the coverage is
obtained with at least 31.1% improvements in sensing reliability as compared to

their past evolution. Nine objects are candidates members to be part of a
compact galaxy group at redshift 0.5814. We find past mutual interaction among
the group candidates that support the scenario of mutual crossings.
Furthermore, the fossil reconstruction of the group candidates brings evidence
that at least three different merger trees could assemble the galaxy group. We
characterize the properties of the galaxy group from which we estimate a lower
limit of the scale and mass of this group. We obtain a scale of $>$146$\pm$3
kpc with a dispersion velocity of 622$\pm$300 km/s. These estimations consider
the lensing effects of the gravitational potential of Holm15A. The other five
objects were studied individually. We use public archive data of integral field
spectroscopic observations from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer
instrument.

nighttime optical observations is assessed. Orbital geometry is used to
calculate the impact of stellar occultations by satellites on the photometry of
individual stars as well as the effect on the photometric calibration of
wide-field observations. Starlink-type satellites will have occultation disks
several arcseconds across. Together with occultation crossing times of 0.1-100
msec, this will lead to photometric `jitter' on the flux determination of
stars. The level of impact for a given star depends on the ratio of the
integration time of the frame over the occultation crossing time. In
current-day, CCD-based synoptic surveys this impact is negligible (<<1%), but
with future, CMOS-based wide-field surveys obtaining data at frequencies >1Hz,
the impact will grow towards complete drop-outs. At integration times similar
to the occultation crossing time, the orbit of a satellite can be traced using
the occultation method. At even shorter integration times the shape of the
occulting satellite can be deduced. Stellar occultations by passing satellites,
enabled by high-speed CMOS technology, will be a new method to study orbiting
satellites. Large scale monitoring programs will be needed to, independently,
determine and update the orbits of satellites.

  Trustworthy AI, Explainable AI, Semantic-guided AI",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Continuous monitoring of trained ML models to determine when their
predictions should and should not be trusted is essential for their safe
deployment. Such a framework ought to be high-performing, explainable, post-hoc
and actionable. We propose TRUST-LAPSE, a ""mistrust"" scoring framework for
continuous model monitoring. We assess the trustworthiness of each input
sample's model prediction using a sequence of latent-space embeddings.
Specifically, (a) our latent-space mistrust score estimates mistrust using
distance metrics (Mahalanobis distance) and similarity metrics (cosine
similarity) in the latent-space and (b) our sequential mistrust score
determines deviations in correlations over the sequence of past input
representations in a non-parametric, sliding-window based algorithm for
actionable continuous monitoring. We evaluate TRUST-LAPSE via two downstream
tasks: (1) distributionally shifted input detection and (2) data drift
detection, across diverse domains -- audio & vision using public datasets and
further benchmark our approach on challenging, real-world electroencephalograms
(EEG) datasets for seizure detection. Our latent-space mistrust scores achieve
state-of-the-art results with AUROCs of 84.1 (vision), 73.9 (audio), 77.1
(clinical EEGs), outperforming baselines by over 10 points. We expose critical
failures in popular baselines that remain insensitive to input semantic
content, rendering them unfit for real-world model monitoring. We show that our
sequential mistrust scores achieve high drift detection rates: over 90% of the
streams show < 20% error for all domains. Through extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations, we show that our mistrust scores are more robust and
provide explainability for easy adoption into practice.

into a matrix-approach to multi-state life insurance, where formulas for
reserves, moments of future payments and equivalence premiums can be obtained
as explicit formulas in terms of product integrals or matrix exponentials. To
this end we consider the Markovian interest model, where the rates are
piecewise deterministic (or even constant) in the different states of a Markov
jump process, and which is shown to integrate naturally into the matrix
framework. The discounting factor then becomes the price of a zero-coupon bond
which may or may not be correlated with the biometric insurance process.
Another nice feature about the Markovian interest model is that the price of
the bond coincides with the survival function of a phase-type distributed
random variable. This, in particular, allows for calibrating the Markovian
interest rate models using a maximum likelihood approach to observed data
(prices) or to theoretical models like e.g. a Vasicek model. Due to the
denseness of phase-type distributions, we can approximate the price behaviour
of any zero-coupon bond with interest rates bounded from below by choosing the
number of possible interest rate values sufficiently large. For observed data
models with few data points, lower dimensions will usually suffice, while for
theoretical models the dimensionality is only a computational issue.

one parity-odd correlation proportional to $\vec{s_{n}} \cdot \vec{k_{\gamma}}$
and one parity-even correlation proportional to $\vec{s_{n}} \cdot \vec{k_{n}}
\times \vec{k_{\gamma}}$. A parity violating asymmetry can appear in this
reaction due to the weak nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction which mixes opposite
parity S and P-wave levels in the excited compound $^{36}$Cl nucleus formed
upon slow neutron capture. If parity-violating (PV) and parity-conserving (PC)
terms both exist, the measured differential cross section can be related to
them via $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\propto1+A_{\gamma,
PV}\cos\theta+A_{\gamma,PC}\sin\theta$. The PV and PC asymmetries for
energy-weighted gamma cascade angular distributions for polarized slow neutron
capture on $^{35}$Cl averaged over the neutron energies from 2.27~meV to
9.53~meV were measured to be $A_{\gamma,PV}=(-23.9\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$ and
$A_{\gamma,PC}=(0.1\pm0.7)\times 10^{-6}$. These results are consistent with
previous experimental results. Systematic errors were quantified and shown to
be small compared to the statistical error. These asymmetries in the angular
distributions of the gamma rays emitted from the capture of polarized neutrons
in $^{35}$Cl were used to verify the operation and data analysis procedures for
the NPDGamma experiment which measured the parity-odd asymmetry in the angular

resonance fingerprinting (MRF) datasets of L-arginine phantoms, whole-brains,
and calf muscles from healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and cardiac patients
were acquired using 3T clinical scanners at 3 different sites, using 3
different scanner models and coils. A generative adversarial network supervised
framework (GAN-CEST) was then designed and trained to learn the mapping from a
reduced input data space to the quantitative exchange parameter space, while
preserving perceptual and quantitative content. Results: The GAN-CEST 3D
acquisition time was 42-52 seconds, 70% shorter than CEST-MRF. The quantitative
reconstruction of the entire brain took 0.8 seconds. An excellent agreement was
observed between the ground truth and GAN-based L-arginine concentration and pH
values (Pearson's r > 0.97, NRMSE < 1.5%). GAN-CEST images from a brain-tumor
subject yielded a semi-solid volume fraction and exchange rate NRMSE of
3.8$\pm$1.3% and 4.6$\pm$1.3%, respectively, and SSIM of 96.3$\pm$1.6% and
95.0$\pm$2.4%, respectively. The mapping of the calf-muscle exchange parameters
in a cardiac patient, yielded NRMSE < 7% and SSIM > 94% for the semi-solid
exchange parameters. In regions with large susceptibility artifacts, GAN-CEST
has demonstrated improved performance and reduced noise compared to MRF.
Conclusion: GAN-CEST can substantially reduce the acquisition time for
quantitative semisolid MT/CEST mapping, while retaining performance even when
facing pathologies and scanner models that were not available during training.

which in various cases limits the parsimonious properties of the resulting
representation. This paper develops the theory required to solve the general
case through maximum likelihood estimation, and in particular, using the
expectation-maximization algorithm. A reduction to a piecewise constant
intensity matrix function is proposed in order to provide succinct
representations, where a parametric linear model binds the intensities
together. Practical aspects are discussed and illustrated through the
estimation of notoriously demanding theoretical distributions and real data,
from the perspective of matrix analytic methods.

  Lie groups and groups of polynomial growth","56 pages",,,,"math.MG math.CA math.FA math.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We establish ``vertical versus horizontal inequalities'' for functions from
nonabelian simply connected nilpotent Lie groups and not virtually abelian
finitely generated groups of polynomial growth into uniformly convex Banach
spaces using the vector-valued Littlewood--Paley--Stein theory approach of
Lafforgue and Naor (2012). This is a quantitative nonembeddability statement
that shows that any Lipschitz mapping from the aforementioned groups into a
uniformly convex space must quantitatively collapse along certain subgroups. As
a consequence, a ball of radius $r\ge 2$ in the aforementioned groups must
incur bilipschitz distortion at least a constant multiple of $(\log r)^{1/q}$
into a $q(\ge 2)$-uniformly convex Banach space. This bound is sharp for the
$L^p$ ($1<p<\infty$) spaces.
  In the special case of mappings of Carnot groups into the $L^p$
($1<p<\infty$) spaces, we prove that the quantitative collapse occurs on a
larger subgroup that is the commutator subgroup; this is in line with the
qualitative Pansu--Semmes nonembeddability argument given by Cheeger and
Kleiner (2006) and Lee and Naor (2006). We prove this by establishing a version
of the classical Dorronsoro theorem on Carnot groups. Previously, in the
setting of Heisenberg groups, F\""assler and Orponen (2019) established a
one-sided Dorronsoro theorem with a restriction $0<\alpha<2$ on the range of
exponents $\alpha$ of the Laplacian; this restriction does not appear in the
commutative setting and is caused by their use of horizontal polynomials as
approximants. We identify the correct class of approximant polynomials and
prove the two-sided Dorronsoro theorem with the full range $0<\alpha<\infty$ of
exponents in the general setting of Carnot groups, thus strengthening and
extending the work of F\""assler and Orponen.

over graphs due to their impressive capability of capturing nonlinear relations

marginal improvement of GNNs over their linear counterparts has been observed.
Previous works provide very few understandings of this phenomenon. In this

non-linearity in GNNs for node classification tasks. Given a graph generated
from the statistical model CSBM, we observe that the max-a-posterior estimation
of a node label given its own and neighbors' attributes consists of two types
of non-linearity, a possibly non-linear transformation of node attributes and a
ReLU-activated feature aggregation from neighbors. The latter surprisingly
matches the type of non-linearity used in many GNN models. By further imposing
Gaussian assumption on node attributes, we prove that the superiority of those
ReLU activations is only significant when the node attributes are far more
informative than the graph structure, which nicely matches many previous
empirical observations. A similar argument can be achieved when there is a
distribution shift of node attributes between the training and testing
datasets. Finally, we verify our theory on both synthetic and real-world

of further improvements in material properties such as strength and ductility.
In this paper, we adopt a recently developed computational framework to
quantify the effects of material uncertainties on the ballistic performance of
Mg alloys. The framework is able to determine the largest deviation in the
performance measure resulting from a finite variation in the corresponding
material properties. It can also provide rigorous upper bounds on the
probability of failure using known information about uncertainties and the
system, and then conservative safety design and certification can be achieved.
We specifically focus on AZ31B Mg alloys, and assume that the material is
well-characterized by the Johnson-Cook constitutive and failure models, but the
model parameters are uncertain. We determine the ordering of uncertainty
contributions for model parameters and the corresponding behavior regimes where
those parameters play a crucial role. Finally, we show that how this ordering
provides insight on the improvement of ballistic performance and the
development of new material models for Mg alloys.

gap function coincides with the center-of-mass wave function of a Cooper pair

At lower temperatures they can significantly deviate from each other, and the
question arises as to which of these lengths should be given the preference

goes beyond dyadic interactions. While some group homophily definitions have
been proposed in the literature, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence
that prior definitions mostly inherit properties of homophily in pairwise

propose a new measure, $k$-simplicial homophily, which properly identifies
homophily in group dynamics. Across 16 empirical networks, $k$-simplicial
homophily provides information uncorrelated with homophily measures on pairwise

and depth ambiguity, especially in the cases of crowd scenes. To solve these
problems, most existing methods explore modeling body context cues by enhancing
feature representation with graph neural networks or adding structural
constraints. However, these methods are not robust for their single-root
formulation that decoding 3D poses from a root node with a pre-defined graph.
In this paper, we propose GR-M3D, which models the \textbf{M}ulti-person
\textbf{3D} pose estimation with dynamic \textbf{G}raph \textbf{R}easoning. The
decoding graph in GR-M3D is predicted instead of pre-defined. In particular, It
firstly generates several data maps and enhances them with a scale and depth
aware refinement module (SDAR). Then multiple root keypoints and dense decoding
paths for each person are estimated from these data maps. Based on them,
dynamic decoding graphs are built by assigning path weights to the decoding
paths, while the path weights are inferred from those enhanced data maps. And
this process is named dynamic graph reasoning (DGR). Finally, the 3D poses are
decoded according to dynamic decoding graphs for each detected person. GR-M3D
can adjust the structure of the decoding graph implicitly by adopting soft path
weights according to input data, which makes the decoding graphs be adaptive to
different input persons to the best extent and more capable of handling
occlusion and depth ambiguity than previous methods. We empirically show that
the proposed bottom-up approach even outperforms top-down methods and achieves
state-of-the-art results on three 3D pose datasets.

lattice structure of the 2D solid dusty plasma perfectly matches the triangular
substrate, two distinctive pinned and moving ordered states are observed, as
the external uniform driving force gradually increases from zero. When there is
a mismatch between the lattice structure and the triangular substrate, however,
on shallow substrates, it is discovered that all of the particles can slide
freely on the substrate even when the applied driving force is tiny. This is a
typical example of superlubricity, which is caused by the competition between
the substrate-particle and particle-particle interactions. If the substrate
depth increases further, as the driving force increases from zero, there are
three dynamical states consisting of the pinned, the disordered plastic flow,
and the moving ordered. In an underdense system, where there are fewer
particles than potential well minima, it is found that the occurrence of the
three different dynamical states is controlled by the depth of the substrate,
which is quantitatively characterized using the average mobility.

For a class of LQG-GMFGs, analytical expressions are derived for the infinite
horizon Nash values at the nodes of the infinite graph. Furthermore, under
specific conditions on the network and the initial population means, it is
shown that the nodes with strict local maximal infinite network degree are also
nodes with strict local minimal cost at equilibrium.

that suffer from subpar performance and (2) apply fairness mitigation measures
targeting the cohorts discovered. In this paper, we report on initial findings
with both discovery and mitigation of performance disparities using data from a
product-scale AI assistant speech recognition system. We compare cohort
discovery based on geographic and demographic information to a more scalable
method that groups speakers without human labels, using speaker embedding
technology. For fairness mitigation, we find that oversampling of
underrepresented cohorts, as well as modeling speaker cohort membership by
additional input variables, reduces the gap between top- and bottom-performing
cohorts, without deteriorating overall recognition accuracy.

evolution is influenced by effects associated with the strong coupling.
Specifically, disorder-induced heating is found to rapidly heat ions on a
timescale of the ion plasma period (~10s ps) after an ionization pulse. This is
followed by the collisional relaxation of ions and neutrals, which cools ions
and heats neutrals on a longer (~ns) timescale. Slight heating then occurs over
a much longer (~ 100s ns) timescale due to ion-neutral three-body

complexity of these multi-layer and non-linear models. Several heatmap methods
have been proposed to address this issue and analyze the imaging patterns
extracted from the deep neural networks, but no quantitative comparison between
these methods has been carried out so far. In this work, we explore these
questions by deriving heatmaps from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained
using T1 MRI scans of the ADNI data set, and by comparing these heatmaps with
brain maps corresponding to Support Vector Machines (SVM) coefficients. Three
prominent heatmap methods are studied: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
Integrated Gradients (IG), and Guided Grad-CAM (GGC). Contrary to prior studies
where the quality of heatmaps was visually or qualitatively assessed, we
obtained precise quantitative measures by computing overlap with a ground-truth
map from a large meta-analysis that combined 77 voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
studies independently from ADNI. Our results indicate that all three heatmap
methods were able to capture brain regions covering the meta-analysis map and
achieved better results than SVM coefficients. Among them, IG produced the
heatmaps with the best overlap with the independent meta-analysis.

be the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will be

the players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations between
different features of football players and their salaries - how each feature
affects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect the
salary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, the
salary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so this

basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.

that are less relevant but more engaging and for knowledge-grounded

first-principles calculations, we systematically study the electronic
structure, optical properties of quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) ML and
quasi-tetragonal phase (qTP) ML fullerenes. The calculations of qHP ML show
that it is a semi-conductor with small anisotropic optical absorption, which
agrees with the recent experimental measurements. However, the results for qTP
ML reveal that it is a semimetal with highly in-plane anisotropic absorption.
The dichroic ratio, namely the absorption ratio of $x$- and $y$-polarized light
$\alpha$$_x$$_x$/$\alpha$$_y$$_y$, is around 12 at photon energy of 0.29 eV.
This anisotropy is much more pronounced when the photon energy is between 0.7

is more than two orders of magnitude larger. This indicates qTP ML as a
candidate for long-pursuit lossless metal and a potential material for
atomically thin polarizer. We hope this will stimulate further experimental
efforts in the study of qTP ML and other fullerene-assembled 2D materials.

  As expected, latency places constraints on the overall gain $K$ for which the
loop is stable. However, latency also creates spectral peaks at stable gains in
the spectral response of the closed loop. Near these peaks, the feedback loop
amplifies (rather than suppresses) input signals at its summing junction,
rendering it unsuitable for nulling over a range of stable gains.

study the low-temperature transport properties. We found a resistivity upturn
below 10 K. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resistivity
are in good agreement with a combination of the theory of disorder-enhanced
three-dimensional electron-electron and single-channel Kondo effect. The Kondo
effect exists only at low magnetic field B < 3 T, while electron-electron
dominates the appearance for the low-temperature resistivity upturn. We believe
that the enhanced three-dimensional electron-electron interaction in this

future where autonomous systems will be driving entire business decisions and,
more broadly, supporting large-scale decision-making infrastructure to solve
society's most challenging problems. Issues of unfairness and discrimination
are pervasive when decisions are being made by humans, and remain (or are
potentially amplified) when decisions are made using machines with little
transparency, accountability, and fairness. In this paper, we introduce a
framework for \textit{causal fairness analysis} with the intent of filling in
this gap, i.e., understanding, modeling, and possibly solving issues of
fairness in decision-making settings. The main insight of our approach will be
to link the quantification of the disparities present on the observed data with
the underlying, and often unobserved, collection of causal mechanisms that
generate the disparity in the first place, challenge we call the Fundamental
Problem of Causal Fairness Analysis (FPCFA). In order to solve the FPCFA, we
study the problem of decomposing variations and empirical measures of fairness
that attribute such variations to structural mechanisms and different units of
the population. Our effort culminates in the Fairness Map, which is the first
systematic attempt to organize and explain the relationship between different
criteria found in the literature. Finally, we study which causal assumptions
are minimally needed for performing causal fairness analysis and propose a
Fairness Cookbook, which allows data scientists to assess the existence of
disparate impact and disparate treatment.

a simultaneous improvement of these two parameters in {\epsilon}-Ga2O3 MSM

effective light absorption depth, the {\epsilon}-Ga2O3 MSM photodetector
achieves over 18-fold enhancement of responsivity and simultaneous reduction of
the response time, which exhibits a state-of-the-art photo-to-dark current
ratio near 10^8, a superior responsivity of >1300 A/W, an ultrahigh detectivity
of >10^16 Jones and a decay time of 123 ms. Combined depth-profile
spectroscopic and microscopic analysis reveals the existence of a broad
defective region near the lattice-mismatched interface followed by a more
defect-free dark region, while the latter one serves as a diffusion barrier to
assist frontward carrier transport for substantially enhancing the

quantum signatures of the third-order Hall effect are revealed, which are
independent of the system symmetry. The first quantum signature is quantum
enhancement of the third-order Hall current, which is characterized by sharp
current peaks whose magnitudes are three orders larger than the first-order

coherent transport, and it can be easily destroyed by dephasing effect. The

used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the packet delay and clock
drift pose challenges to accuracy, as they entail serious by-hop error
accumulation problems in the WSNs. To overcome it, a rapid flooding
multi-broadcast time synchronization with real-time delay compensation
(RDC-RMTS) is proposed in this paper. By using a rapid-flooding protocol,
flooding latency of the referenced time information is significantly reduced in
the RDC-RMTS. In addition, a new joint clock skew-offset maximum likelihood
estimation is developed to obtain the accurate clock parameter estimations, and
the real-time packet delay estimation. Moreover, an innovative implementation
of the RDC-RMTS is designed with an adaptive clock offset estimation. The
experimental results indicate that, the RDC-RMTS can easily reduce the variable
delay and significantly slow the growth of by-hop error accumulation. Thus, the
proposed RDC-RMTS can achieve accurate time synchronization in large-scale
complex WSNs.

heart of many emerging applications in nanotechnology. For common NEMS, such as
beams and strings, the oscillatory dynamics is formulated using a
dissipationless wave equation derived from elasticity. Under a harmonic ansatz,
the wave equation gives an undamped free vibration equation; solving this
equation with the proper boundary conditions provides the undamped
eigenfunctions with the familiar standing wave patterns. Any harmonically
driven solution is expressible in terms of these undamped eigenfunctions. Here,
we show that this formalism becomes inconvenient as dissipation increases. To
this end, we experimentally map out the position- and frequency-dependent
oscillatory motion of a NEMS string resonator driven linearly by a
non-symmetric force on one end at different dissipation limits. At low
dissipation (high Q factor), we observe sharp resonances with standing wave
patterns that closely match the eigenfunctions of an undamped string. With a
slight increase in dissipation, the standing wave patterns become lost and
waves begin to propagate along the nanostructure. At large dissipation (low Q
factor), these propagating waves become strongly attenuated and display little,
if any, resemblance to the undamped string eigenfunctions. A more efficient and
intuitive description of the oscillatory dynamics of a NEMS resonator can be
obtained by superposition of waves propagating along the nanostructure.

for abdominal QSM.
  Theory and Methods: An optimized approach to estimation of magnetic
susceptibility distribution is formulated as a constrained reconstruction
problem that incorporates estimates of the input data reliability and
anatomical priors available from chemical shift-encoded imaging. The proposed
data-adaptive method was evaluated with respect to bias, repeatability, and

  Results: The data-adaptive method produced susceptibility maps with higher
subjective quality due to reduced shading artifacts. For both acquisition
protocols, higher linear correlation with both $R_2$ and $R_2^*$-based
measurements were observed for the data-adaptive method ($r^2=0.74/0.72$ for
$R_2$, $0.98/0.99$ for $R_2^*$) than the standard method ($r^2=0.62/0.67$ and

test-retest repeatability (repeatability coefficients 0.14/0.14ppm for the

becomes zero as temperature ($T$) approaches zero. Contrarily, glass and other
similar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the third
law. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by
regarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many
inconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to
these inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law
without any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature
of entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only
when thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are
TCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for
solids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On
this basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of
atoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be
assigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by
discrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations.
Among various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at
sufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration,
which do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that
region. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by
expressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes
at $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended
space including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high
temperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained
through several debates on the glass transition.

evaluated mathematically based on a Moment Generating Function (MGF) based

3) By increasing the number of antennas and BS density in an RSMA-enhanced

integration. Over the years, research on entity alignment has resided on the
assumption that KGs are static, which neglects the nature of growth of
real-world KGs. As KGs grow, previous alignment results face the need to be
revisited while new entity alignment waits to be discovered. In this paper, we
propose and dive into a realistic yet unexplored setting, referred to as
continual entity alignment. To avoid retraining an entire model on the whole
KGs whenever new entities and triples come, we present a continual alignment
method for this task. It reconstructs an entity's representation based on
entity adjacency, enabling it to generate embeddings for new entities quickly
and inductively using their existing neighbors. It selects and replays partial
pre-aligned entity pairs to train only parts of KGs while extracting
trustworthy alignment for knowledge augmentation. As growing KGs inevitably
contain non-matchable entities, different from previous works, the proposed
method employs bidirectional nearest neighbor matching to find new entity
alignment and update old alignment. Furthermore, we also construct new datasets
by simulating the growth of multilingual DBpedia. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our continual alignment method is more effective than
baselines based on retraining or inductive learning.

sequences are time-consuming to run, and predicting the quality of the results
(QoR) against the synthesis optimization sequence for a circuit can help
engineers find a better optimization sequence faster. In this work, we propose
a deep learning method to predict the QoR of unseen circuit-optimization
sequences pairs. Specifically, the structure transformations are translated
into vectors by embedding methods and advanced natural language processing
(NLP) technology (Transformer) is used to extract the features of the
optimization sequences. In addition, to enable the prediction process of the
model to be generalized from circuit to circuit, the graph representation of
the circuit is represented as an adjacency matrix and a feature matrix. Graph
neural networks(GNN) are used to extract the structural features of the
circuits. For this problem, the Transformer and three typical GNNs are used.
Furthermore, the Transformer and GNNs are adopted as a joint learning policy
for the QoR prediction of the unseen circuit-optimization sequences. The
methods resulting from the combination of Transformer and GNNs are benchmarked.
The experimental results show that the joint learning of Transformer and

learning model across multiple clients with the help from a central server. The
local dataset held by each client is never exchanged in FL, so the local
dataset privacy is protected. Although FL is increasingly popular, data
heterogeneity across different clients leads to the client model drift issue
and results in model performance degradation and poor model fairness. To
address the issue, we design Federated learning with global-local Knowledge
Fusion (FedKF) scheme in this paper. The key idea in FedKF is to let the server
return the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in each
training round so that the local model can be regularized towards the global
optima. Thus, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In FedKF, we first
propose the active-inactive model aggregation technique that supports a precise
global knowledge representation. Then, we propose a data-free knowledge
distillation (KD) approach to facilitate the KD from the global model to the
local model while the local model can still learn the local knowledge (embedded
in the local dataset) simultaneously, thereby realizing the global-local
knowledge fusion process. The theoretical analysis and intensive experiments
demonstrate that FedKF achieves high model performance, high fairness, and
privacy-preserving simultaneously. The project source codes will be released on

exercise to improve our understanding of the universe and quantify tension

by differing systematics, instrumental effects and contaminating signals, which

around 5 correspond to key physical quantities. We present a means by which to

as a new technology that can support the enormous data traffic increasing on
daily basis. Laser-based OWC networks can provide terabits per second (Tbps)
aggregate data rates. However, the emerging OWC networks require clusters of
optical transmitters to provide uniform coverage for multiple users. In this
context, multi-user interference (MUI) is a crucial issue that must be managed
efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. Rate splitting (RS) is
proposed as a transmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously by
splitting the message of a given user into common and private messages, and
then, each user decodes the desired message following a certain procedure. In
radio frequency (RF) networks, RS provides higher spectral efficiency compared
with orthogonal and non-orthogonal transmission schemes. Considering the high
density of OWC networks, the performance of RS is limited by the cost of
providing channel state information (CSI) at transmitters and by the noise
resulting from interference cancellation. In this work, a user-grouping
algorithm is proposed and used to form multiple groups, each group contains
users spatially clustered. Then, an outer precoder is designed to manage
inter-group interference following the methodology of blind interference
alignment (BIA), which reduces the requirements of CSI at RF or optical
transmitters. For intra-group interference, RS is applied within each group

counterpart of the heat capacity which is defined as the second cumulant of the
entanglement spectrum. Given any bipartite pure state, we can define the
capacity of entanglement as the variance of the modular Hamiltonian in the
reduced state of any of the subsystems. Here, we study the dynamics of this
quantity under non-local Hamiltonian. Specifically, we address the question:
Given an arbitrary non-local Hamiltonian what is the capacity of entanglement
that the system can possess? As an useful application, we show that the quantum
speed limit for creating the entanglement is not only governed by the
fluctuation in the non-local Hamiltonian, but also depends inversely on the
time average of square root of the capacity of entanglement. Furthermore, we
discuss this quantity for a general self-inverse Hamiltonian and provide a
bound on the rate of the capacity of entanglement. Towards the end, we
generalise the capacity of entanglement for bipartite mixed states based on the
relative entropy of entanglement and show that the above definition reduces to
the capacity of entanglement for pure bipartite states. Our results can have
several applications in diverse areas of physics.

adopt the encoder-decoder networks, which directly predict the markup sequences

fail to accurately read formulas with complicated structure or generate long
markup sequences, as the attention results are often inaccurate due to the
large variance of writing styles or spatial layouts. To alleviate this problem,
we propose an unconventional network for HMER named Counting-Aware Network
(CAN), which jointly optimizes two tasks: HMER and symbol counting.
Specifically, we design a weakly-supervised counting module that can predict
the number of each symbol class without the symbol-level position annotations,
and then plug it into a typical attention-based encoder-decoder model for HMER.
Experiments on the benchmark datasets for HMER validate that both joint
optimization and counting results are beneficial for correcting the prediction
errors of encoder-decoder models, and CAN consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, compared with an encoder-decoder model
for HMER, the extra time cost caused by the proposed counting module is
marginal. The source code is available at https://github.com/LBH1024/CAN.

of the most divergent bare BCS susceptibility through a valley-contrasting flux
3$\phi$ in each triangular plaquette at $\phi=\frac{\pi}{3}$ and
$\phi=\frac{\pi}{6}$ in moir\'e systems. This makes the PDW order a possible
leading instability for an electronic system with repulsive interactions. We
confirm that it indeed wins over all other instabilities and becomes the ground
state under certain conditions through the renormalization group calculation
and a flux insertion argument. Moreover, we also find that a topological
nontrivial loop current order becomes the leading instability if the Fermi
surface with conventional VHS is perfectly nested at $\phi=\frac{\pi}{3}$.
Similar to the Haldane model, this loop current state has the quantum anomalous
Hall effect. If we dope this loop current state or introduce a finite
next-nearest neighbour hopping $t^{\prime}$, the chiral $d$-wave PDW becomes
the dominant instability. Experimentally, the flux can be effectively tuned by
an out-of-plane electric field in moir\'e systems based on graphene and
transition metal dichalcogenides.

ruler for converting the raw phase measurements into a physical displacement in

(CF-mMIMO) must be addressed for accommodating a large number of users. In
previous works, we have investigated a decontamination method called subspace
projection (SP). The SP separates interference from co-pilot users by using the
orthogonality of the principal components of the users' channel subspaces.
Non-overloaded pilot assignment (PA), where each radio unit (RU) does not
assign the same pilot to different users, limits the spectral efficiency (SE)
of the system, since SP channel estimation is able to deal with co-pilot users
that have nearly orthogonal subspaces. Motivated by this limitation, this paper
introduces overloaded PA methods adjusted for the decontamination in order to
improve the sum SE of CF systems. Numerical simulations show that the
overloaded PA methods give higher SE than that of non-overloaded PA at a high
user density scenario.

collection of images with ground truth labels. Labels define object classes in
the image, as well as their locations, shape, and possibly other information
such as pose. The labeling process has proven extremely time consuming, even
with the presence of manpower. We introduce a novel labeling tool for 2D images
as well as 3D triangular meshes: 3D Labeling Tool (3DLT). This is a standalone,
feature-heavy and cross-platform software that does not require installation
and can run on Windows, macOS and Linux-based distributions. Instead of
labeling the same object on every image separately like current tools, we use
depth information to reconstruct a triangular mesh from said images and label
the object only once on the aforementioned mesh. We use registration to
simplify 3D labeling, outlier detection to improve 2D bounding box calculation
and surface reconstruction to expand labeling possibility to large point
clouds. Our tool is tested against state of the art methods and it greatly
surpasses them in terms of speed while preserving accuracy and ease of use.

astrophysical objects. We show that the photons in a relativistic plasma with a
variable Lorentz factor go through repeated scattering with electrons to gain
energy. The escaped population of photons naturally produces a power-law-shaped
spectrum making it an anisotropic analogue to the conventional Fermi
acceleration mechanism of charged particles. Thus, this mechanism provides a
natural alternative to current explanations of high energy power-law spectra
via synchrotron or thermal Comptonization. The model is applicable to any
relativistic plasma beam with an arbitrary Lorentz factor profile. We implement
the theory to GRB prompt phase and show that the obtained range of the photon
indices is compatible with the observed values. Therefore, the observed high
energy spectral indices provide a unique indicator of the jet structure.

  (ICPR) 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Emotion recognition is involved in several real-world applications. With an
increase in available modalities, automatic understanding of emotions is being
performed more accurately. The success in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER),
primarily relies on the supervised learning paradigm. However, data annotation
is expensive, time-consuming, and as emotion expression and perception depends
on several factors (e.g., age, gender, culture) obtaining labels with a high
reliability is hard. Motivated by these, we focus on unsupervised feature
learning for MER. We consider discrete emotions, and as modalities text, audio
and vision are used. Our method, as being based on contrastive loss between
pairwise modalities, is the first attempt in MER literature. Our end-to-end
feature learning approach has several differences (and advantages) compared to
existing MER methods: i) it is unsupervised, so the learning is lack of data
labelling cost; ii) it does not require data spatial augmentation, modality
alignment, large number of batch size or epochs; iii) it applies data fusion
only at inference; and iv) it does not require backbones pre-trained on emotion
recognition task. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method
outperforms several baseline approaches and unsupervised learning methods
applied in MER. Particularly, it even surpasses a few supervised MER
state-of-the-art.

dynamical systems. In the literature, there are very few results on the
irreducibility of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by pure jump noise. The
existing methods on this topic are basically along the same lines as that for
the Gaussian case. They heavily rely on the fact that the driving noises are
additive type and more or less in the class of stable processes. The use of
such methods to deal with the case of other types of additive pure jump noises
appears to be unclear, let alone the case of multiplicative noises.
  In this paper, we develop a new, effective method to obtain the
irreducibility of SPDEs and SDEs driven by multiplicative pure jump noise. The
conditions placed on the coefficients and the driving noise are very mild, and
in some sense they are necessary and sufficient. This leads to not only
significantly improving all of the results in the literature, but also to new
irreducibility results of a much larger class of equations driven by pure jump
noise with much weaker requirements than those treatable by the known methods.
As a result, we are able to apply the main results to SPDEs with locally
monotone coefficients, SPDEs/SDEs with singular coefficients, nonlinear $\rm
Schr\ddot{o}dinger$ equations, Euler equations etc. We emphasize that under our
setting the driving noises could be compound Poisson processes, even allowed to
be infinite dimensional. It is somehow surprising.

  Nazarov and Peres (STOC 2017), and De, O'Donnell and Servedio (STOC 2017)

Holden, Pemantle, Peres and Zhai (COLT 2018) adapt the techniques used to prove
this upper bound, to an algorithm for the average-case trace reconstruction
with a sample complexity of $\exp(O(\log^{1/3} n))$. However, it is not clear
how to apply their techniques more generally and in particular for the recent

complexity of several phenomena. Unfortunately, such an approach is often made
difficult by the large number of variables to take into consideration. Methods
of dimensional reduction are useful tools to rescale a complex dynamical
network down to a low-dimensional effective system and thus to capture the
global features of the dynamics. Here we study the application of the
degree-weighted and spectral reduction methods to an important class of
dynamical processes on networks: the propagation of credit shocks within an
interbank network, modelled according to the DebtRank algorithm. In particular
we introduce an effective version of the dynamics, characterised by functions
with continuous derivatives that can be handled by the dimensional reduction.
We test the reduction methods against the full dynamical system in different
interbank market settings: homogeneous and heterogeneous networks generated
from state-of-the-art reconstruction methods as well as networks derived from
empirical e-MID data. Our results indicate that, for proper choices of the bank
default probability, reduction methods are able to provide reliable estimates
of systemic risk in the market, with the spectral reduction better handling
heterogeneous networks. Finally we provide new physical insights on the nature
and working principles of dimensional reduction methods.

synergy between a laser-driven and particle-driven accelerator: a high-charge
laser-wakefield accelerated electron bunch can drive its own wakefield while
simultaneously drawing energy from the laser pulse via direct laser
acceleration. This process continues to accelerate electrons beyond the usual
decelerating phase of the wakefield, thus reaching much higher energies. We
find that the 10-centimeter-long nanoparticle-assisted wakefield accelerator
can generate 340 pC, 10.4+-0.6 GeV electron bunches with 3.4 GeV RMS convolved
energy spread and 0.9 mrad RMS divergence. It can also produce bunches with
lower energy, a few percent energy spread, and a higher charge. This
synergistic mechanism and the simplicity of the experimental setup represent a
step closer to compact tabletop particle accelerators suitable for applications
requiring high charge at high energies, such as free electron lasers or

goldstino superfield associated with the breaking of supersymmetry at low
energy -- can substantially modify the dynamics of inflation in the primordial
Universe. So-called sgoldstinoless models assume the existence of a nilpotency
constraint $S^2=0$ that effectively removes the sgoldstino from the theory.
Such models were proposed to realise non-oscillatory inflation scenarios with a
single scalar field, which feature a long period of kination at the end of
inflation, and therefore a non-standard post-inflationary cosmology. Using
effective operators, we propose models in which the sgoldstino is stabilized
close to the origin to reproduce the nilpotent constraint. We show that small
sgoldstino fluctuations may lead to a sizeable back-reaction on the
cosmological history. We study the effect of this back-reaction on the
inflation observables measured in the cosmic microwave background and confront
the model to a series of constraints including limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$.
We show that the peculiar form of the potential in the large supersymmetry
breaking scale limit can generate peaks in the scalar power spectrum produced
from inflation. We study how certain perturbation modes may re-enter the
horizon during or after kination and show that a large supersymmetry breaking
scale may lead to the formation of primordial black holes with various masses
in the early Universe.

shown that the considered theory has a nontrivial continuous limit. A new
method is proposed without the use of perturbation theory and diagrams. We have
used the explored duality between different lattice field theories. After its
application, it turns out that it is possible to apply the saddle-point method
to the generating functional, where the concentration of nodes of the initial
lattice approximation acts as a large parameter. In addition to the connected
contributions to the $S$-matrix, the beta function is calculated. We have found
a critical point for the theory of $\phi^{4k}$ in arbitrary dimension and a
nontrivial mass gap of the interacting massless theory. We have received the
masses of bound and single-particle states of the interacting theory. The
proposed method can be extend for application to QED and gauge theories, as
well as generalized to the arbitrary geometry of space. Though the way of
coupling rescaling is specific, it gives nontrivial theory with the majority of

  Abdominal Organ Segmentation","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.04568",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Abdominal organ segmentation has many important clinical applications, such
as organ quantification, surgical planning, and disease diagnosis. However,
manually annotating organs from CT scans is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Semi-supervised learning has shown the potential to alleviate this challenge by
learning from a large set of unlabeled images and limited labeled samples. In
this work, we follow the self-training strategy and employ a high-performance
hybrid architecture (PHTrans) consisting of CNN and Swin Transformer for the
teacher model to generate precise pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Afterward,
we introduce them with labeled data together into a two-stage segmentation
framework with lightweight PHTrans for training to improve the performance and
generalization ability of the model while remaining efficient. Experiments on
the validation set of FLARE2022 demonstrate that our method achieves excellent
segmentation performance as well as fast and low-resource model inference. The
average DSC and NSD are 0.8956 and 0.9316, respectively. Under our development
environments, the average inference time is 18.62 s, the average maximum GPU
memory is 1995.04 MB, and the area under the GPU memory-time curve and the
average area under the CPU utilization-time curve are 23196.84 and 319.67. The

  Dewarping in the Wild","This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Camera-captured document images usually suffer from perspective and geometric
deformations. It is of great value to rectify them when considering poor visual
aesthetics and the deteriorated performance of OCR systems. Recent
learning-based methods intensively focus on the accurately cropped document
image. However, this might not be sufficient for overcoming practical
challenges, including document images either with large marginal regions or
without margins. Due to this impracticality, users struggle to crop documents
precisely when they encounter large marginal regions. Simultaneously, dewarping
images without margins is still an insurmountable problem. To the best of our
knowledge, there is still no complete and effective pipeline for rectifying
document images in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach
called Marior (Margin Removal and \Iterative Content Rectification). Marior
follows a progressive strategy to iteratively improve the dewarping quality and
readability in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we divide the pipeline
into two modules: margin removal module (MRM) and iterative content
rectification module (ICRM). First, we predict the segmentation mask of the
input image to remove the margin, thereby obtaining a preliminary result. Then
we refine the image further by producing dense displacement flows to achieve
content-aware rectification. We determine the number of refinement iterations
adaptively. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method on public benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/ZZZHANG-jx/Marior for further comparison.

to intermediate layers and perform an adaptive layer-matching mechanism trained

to visual recognition tasks show that layer-wise MCL can lead to consistent

attacks on hash functions. Two fundamental advantages of ASICs over general
purpose computers are the area advantage and the energy efficiency. The
memory-hard functions approach the problem by reducing the area advantage of
ASICs compared to general-purpose computers. Traditionally, memory-hard
functions have been analyzed in the (parallel) random oracle model. However, as
the memory-hard security game is multi-stage, indifferentiability does not
apply and instantiating the random oracle becomes a non-trivial problem. Chen
and Tessaro (CRYPTO 2019) considered this issue and showed how random oracles
should be instantiated in the context of memory-hard functions. The
Bandwidth-Hard functions, introduced by Ren and Devadas (TCC 2017), aim to
provide ASIC resistance by reducing the energy advantage of ASICs. In
particular, bandwidth-hard functions provide ASIC resistance by guaranteeing
high run time energy cost if the available cache is not large enough.
Previously, bandwidth-hard functions have been analyzed in the parallel random
oracle model. In this work, we show how those random oracles can be
instantiated using random permutations in the context of bandwidth-hard
functions. Our results are generic and valid for any hard-to-pebble graphs.

(SVM) classifier to identify the tweets with a negative stance toward the
COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 5,163 tweets were used to train the classifier,
out of which a subset of 2,484 tweets were manually annotated by us and made
publicly available. We used the BERTtopic model to extract and investigate the
topics discussed within the negative tweets and how they changed over time. We
show that the negativity with respect to COVID-19 vaccines has decreased over
time along with the vaccine roll-outs. We identify 37 topics of discussion and
present their respective importance over time. We show that popular topics
consist of conspiratorial discussions such as 5G towers and microchips, but
also contain legitimate concerns around vaccination safety and side effects as
well as concerns about policies. Our study shows that even unpopular opinions

acknowledged with the cluster index, they are allowed to access their resource
blocks (RBs) at any time requiring neither further grant acquisitions from the
base station (BS) nor power control as all UEs are requested to transmit at the
same power. In this way, the proposed approach performs an implicit
over-the-air power control with minimal control signaling between BS and UEs,

  Tail-adaptive Approach",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the change point detection problem for high-dimensional linear
regression models. The existing literature mainly focused on the change point
estimation with stringent sub-Gaussian assumptions on the errors. In practice,
however, there is no prior knowledge about the existence of a change point or
the tail structures of errors. To address these issues, in this paper, we
propose a novel tail-adaptive approach for simultaneous change point testing
and estimation. The method is built on a new loss function which is a weighted
combination between the composite quantile and least squared losses, allowing
us to borrow information of the possible change points from both the
conditional mean and quantiles. For the change point testing, based on the
adjusted $L_2$-norm aggregation of a weighted score CUSUM process, we propose a
family of individual testing statistics with different weights to account for
the unknown tail structures. Combining the individual tests, a tail-adaptive
test is further constructed that is powerful for sparse alternatives of
regression coefficients' changes under various tail structures. For the change
point estimation, a family of argmax-based individual estimators is proposed
once a change point is detected. In theory, for both individual and
tail-adaptive tests, the bootstrap procedures are proposed to approximate their
limiting null distributions. Under some mild conditions, we justify the
validity of the new tests in terms of size and power under the high-dimensional
setup. The corresponding change point estimators are shown to be rate optimal
up to a logarithm factor. Moreover, combined with the wild binary segmentation
technique, a new algorithm is proposed to detect multiple change points in a
tail-adaptive manner. Extensive numerical results are conducted to illustrate
the appealing performance of the proposed method.

caudate, putamen, pallidum, and third ventricle, and considered them as
annotating data for DL models, the representative V-Net and UNETR. The Dice
scores and area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating normal, PD, and
P-plus cases were calculated. The segmentation times of V-Net and UNETR for the
six brain structures per patient were 3.48 +- 0.17 and 48.14 +- 0.97 s,
respectively, being at least 300 times faster than FS (15,735 +- 1.07 s). Dice
scores of both DL models were sufficiently high (>0.85), and their AUCs for
disease classification were superior to that of FS. For classification of
normal vs. P-plus and PD vs. multiple systemic atrophy (cerebellar type), the
DL models and FS showed AUCs above 0.8. DL significantly reduces the analysis

and thus modifies the anisotropies present outside the halo of the Galaxy, in

observer (Compton-Getting effect). Also, due to the Galactic rotation, in the
reference frame of an observer at Earth there is an electric component of the
Galactic field that produces a small change in the particles' momentum. This
acceleration depends on the cosmic-ray arrival direction and it hence induces
anisotropies in the flux observed in a given energy range. We analyse the

simplified, and that the second stage of the algorithm is much more important
than the first stage. Hence, we develop a FastATDC algorithm that introduces a
random sampling strategy in both stages. Experimental results show that
FastATDC is 10 to 20 times faster than ATDC on real datasets. Moreover,
FastATDC outperforms the baseline algorithms and is comparable to the ATDC

The accuracy of the drowsiness model reached 44% and a high loss value on the

  using LDA Topic Modelling",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the advent and popularity of big data mining and huge text analysis in
modern times, automated text summarization became prominent for extracting and
retrieving important information from documents. This research investigates
aspects of automatic text summarization from the perspectives of single and
multiple documents. Summarization is a task of condensing huge text articles
into short, summarized versions. The text is reduced in size for summarization
purpose but preserving key vital information and retaining the meaning of the
original document. This study presents the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
approach used to perform topic modelling from summarised medical science
journal articles with topics related to genes and diseases. In this study,
PyLDAvis web-based interactive visualization tool was used to visualise the
selected topics. The visualisation provides an overarching view of the main
topics while allowing and attributing deep meaning to the prevalence individual
topic. This study presents a novel approach to summarization of single and
multiple documents. The results suggest the terms ranked purely by considering
their probability of the topic prevalence within the processed document using
extractive summarization technique. PyLDAvis visualization describes the
flexibility of exploring the terms of the topics' association to the fitted LDA
model. The topic modelling result shows prevalence within topics 1 and 2. This
association reveals that there is similarity between the terms in topic 1 and 2
in this study. The efficacy of the LDA and the extractive summarization methods
were measured using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Recall-Oriented
Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics to evaluate the reliability
and validity of the model.

  Effect Predictions",,"1st Workshop on End-End Customer Journey Optimization at KDD 2022",,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Promotions have been trending in the e-commerce marketplace to build up
customer relationships and guide customers towards the desired actions. Since
incentives are effective to engage customers and customers have different
preferences for different types of incentives, the demand for personalized
promotion decision making is increasing over time.
  However, research on promotion decision making has focused specifically on
purchase conversion during the promotion period (the direct effect), while
generally disregarding the enduring effect in the post promotion period. To
achieve a better lift return on investment (lift ROI) on the enduring effect of
the promotion and improve customer retention and loyalty, we propose a
framework of multiple treatment promotion decision making by modeling each
customer's direct and enduring response. First, we propose a customer direct
and enduring effect (CDEE) model which predicts the customer direct and
enduring response. With the help of the predictions of the CDEE, we personalize
incentive allocation to optimize the enduring effect while keeping the cost
under the budget. To estimate the effect of decision making, we apply an
unbiased evaluation approach of business metrics with randomized control trial
(RCT) data. We compare our method with benchmarks using two promotions in
Mercari and achieve significantly better results.

  Millimeter- Wave Radar",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper establishes a multi-scattering point chest wall motion model by
combining the human respiration signal (RS) and HS (HS) measured by radar. An
algorithmic process is designed based on the model to accurately separate the
human respiration and heartbeat motion. Firstly, a human maximum motion
velocity constraint method is proposed to correct human chest wall tracking,
determine the radial position of the chest wall relative to the radar, and
extract the phase signal corresponding to the chest wall motion. Then an
improved time-difference method is proposed to suppress the interference of RS
harmonics on HS and the interference of low-frequency noise on RS. Finally, an
adaptive Gaussian weighting filter is designed to extract the RS with less
distortion from the phase signal. A low-order finite-length unit impulse
response (FIR) filter is used to extract the HS with less distortion from the
phase signal. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulating
the process of measuring the RS and HS of the chest wall motion model by radar.
The simulation results show that, ideally, the radar measurement results of the
RS and HS are less distorted relative to the actual values. In addition, we
used a millimeter-wave experimental radar system in the 60 GHz band to measure
the respiration rate (RR) and HR (HR) of two subjects. The experimental results
showed that the measured RR and HR correlated well with the actual values. The
quantitative analysis of simulation results and experimental results show that
the proposed method can achieve accurate and robust measurement of RS and HS.

in-person and online, both of which leading to negative outcomes in victims. To
study cyberbullying specifically, 1 million tweets containing keywords
associated with abuse were collected from the beginning of 2019 to the end of
2021 with the Twitter API search endpoint. A natural language processing model
pre-trained on a Twitter corpus generated probabilities for the tweets being
offensive and hateful. To overcome limitations of sampling, data was also
collected using the count endpoint. The fraction of tweets from a given daily
sample marked as abusive is multiplied to the number reported by the count
endpoint. Once these adjusted counts are assembled, a Bayesian autoregressive
Poisson model allows one to study the mean trend and lag functions of the data
and how they vary over time. The results reveal strong weekly and yearly
seasonality in hateful speech but with slight differences across years that may
be attributed to COVID-19.

disseminated an online survey among international students studying at The
University of Alabama (UA) campus, a predominantly white institution in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The objective of this research was to investigate and
analyze international student travel experiences in a city with a significant
college-affiliated population and highlight particular transportation issues in
the area. The survey results show that international students find it difficult
to travel within Tuscaloosa without a personal vehicle, as other modes of
transportation, including walking, biking, and using public transportation, are
not always convenient or reliable. The study findings may be of interest to
transportation experts, city planners, university administrators, and college

tactile learning is still in its infancy due to the limited representative
abilities of existing spiking neurons and high spatio-temporal complexity in
the data. In this paper, to improve the representative capabilities of existing
spiking neurons, we propose a novel neuron model called ""location spiking
neuron"", which enables us to extract features of event-based data in a novel
way. Moreover, based on the classical Time Spike Response Model (TSRM), we
develop a specific location spiking neuron model - Location Spike Response
Model (LSRM) that serves as a new building block of SNNs. Furthermore, we
propose a hybrid model which combines an SNN with TSRM neurons and an SNN with
LSRM neurons to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the data.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements of our models
over other works on event-driven tactile learning and show the superior energy
efficiency of our models and location spiking neurons, which may unlock their
potential on neuromorphic hardware.
