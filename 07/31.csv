make the assumption that detector data contains, at most, one signal at any

valid. In this paper we examine how current search techniques for transient
gravitational waves will behave under the presence of more than one signal. We
perform searches on data sets containing time-overlapping compact binary
coalescences. This includes a modelled, matched filter search (PyCBC), and an
unmodelled coherent search, coherent WaveBurst (cWB). Both of these searches
are used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We find that both searches are
capable of identifying both signals correctly when the signals are dissimilar
in merger time, $|\Delta t_c| \geq 1$ second, with PyCBC losing only $1\%$ of
signals for overlapping binary black hole mergers. Both pipelines can find
signal pairings within the region $|\Delta t_c| < 1$ second. However,
clustering routines in the pipelines will cause only one of the two signals to
be recovered, as such the efficiency is reduced. Within this region, we find
that cWB can identify both signals. We also find that matched filter searches
can be modified to provide estimates of the correct parameters for each signal.

coordinate descent lose their performance guarantees. Furthermore, methods that
handle non-monotonicity lose their performance guarantees when subject to
inter-robot collision avoidance constraints. As it is desirable to retain both
the performance guarantee and safety guarantee, this work proposes a
hierarchical approach with a distributed planner that uses local search with a
worst-case performance guarantees and a decentralized controller based on
control barrier functions that ensures safety and encourages timely arrival at
sensing locations. Via extensive simulations, hardware-in-the-loop tests and

agents with heterogeneous saving interests. There are two procedures in the
standard LGA, i.e., ""propagation"" + ""transaction"". If the propagation step is
removed and the transaction is conducted among all agents, the LGA reduces to a
more simplified kinetic model. In addition, two dealing rules are imposed on
the transaction phase. Under Rule I, the trading volume depends on the average
saving propensities of an arbitrary pair of agents in trade. Under Rule II, the
exchange is governed by a stochastic parameter between the saving propensities
of two traders. Besides, two sampling methods are introduced for the random
selection of two agents in the iterative process. Specifically, Sampling I is
the sampling with replacement and is easier to program. Sampling II is the
sampling without replacement and owns a higher computing efficiency. There are
slight differences between the stationary wealth distributions simulated by
using the two transaction rules and sampling approaches. In addition, the
accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the econophysics models are validated by
typical numerical tests. The reduced LGA without the propagation step owns a
higher computational efficiency than the standard LGA. Moreover, the impact of
saving propensities of agents in two groups on the wealth distributions is
studied, and the influence of proportions of agents is investigated as well. To
quantitatively measure the wealth inequality, the Gini coefficients, Kolkata
indices, and deviation degrees of all agents and two groups are simulated and
analyzed in detail. This work is helpful to further analyze and predict the

formulate a simple mathematical model of seed dispersal on reduced habitats to
discuss survival of the species in relation to the habitat size and seeds
production rate. Seeds get dispersed around the mother plant via several agents
in a random way. In our model seeds landing sites are distributed according to
a homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant rate on $\mathbb{R}$. We
will assume that each seed will successfully germinate and grow into a new
plant with the same characteristics as the mother plant. The time is discrete,
scaled according to generations of plants or can represent years, since annual
plants go through an entire growing cycle during one year. Then we will assume
there are two symmetric barriers with respect to the origin and consider that
the growth can not evolve past the barriers. Imposing barriers correspond to
the physical limitation of the habitat. We appeal to tools of Probability
Theory to formalize and study such a model, which can be seen as a
discrete-time one-dimensional branching random walk with barriers. By means of
coupling techniques and the comparison with suitably constructed multi-type
branching processes we localize the critical parameter of the process around

In addition, we consider a discrete-space version of the model for which exact

observation and characterization of Ion Acoustic soliton in the quiescent argon
plasma produced by filamentary discharge and confined in a multi-pole line cusp
magnetic field device named Multi-pole line Cusp Plasma Device (MPD). In this
system, the electrostatic fluctuations are found to be less than 1%, a
characteristic of quiescent plasma. Ion acoustic soliton has been excited in
MPD, and its propagation velocity and width of them are measured experimentally
and compared with the 1-D Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The interaction of
two counter-propagating solitons is also investigated to confirm propagation's
solitary nature further. After the successful characterization of ion-acoustic
soliton, the effect of varying the cusp magnetic field on the propagation of
ion-acoustic soliton has been studied. It is experimentally observed in MPD
that the pole cusp magnetic field value influences the excitation and
propagation of solitons. The soliton amplitude increases with the pole field up
to some value Bp~0.6kG, then decreases with the further increase in field
values. Meanwhile, the width of the soliton shows different behavior. The role
of primary electron confinement by cusp magnetic field geometry has been used
to explain the observed results.

  Nigeria",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some of the most popular decentralised cryptocurrency networks have drawn
widespread criticism for consuming vast amounts of electricity and have thus
become targets of regulatory interest. Attempts to influence cryptocurrency
network operations via policy in the pursuit of sustainability in the past,
however, have been widely unsuccessful. Some were abandoned out of fear of
jeopardising innovation while others failed due to the highly globalised nature
of decentralised systems. In search of a more effective angle for energy policy
measures, this study follows a consumer-focused approach by analysing the
sentiments of Nigerian cryptocurrency users (${N=158}$) regarding their
perceptions of the sustainability of Bitcoin, an archetypal cryptocurrency with
high electricity consumption. Three main findings emerged: 1) Despite
self-reporting as highly knowledgeable, most participants significantly
underestimated the energy demand of Bitcoin. 2) Those who accurately assessed
the energy demand of Bitcoin were more likely to support measures targeting its
energy demand than those who misestimated it. 3) Those who supported measures
predominantly held private actors responsible. In light of these findings, we
conclude that the primary task of policymakers in the context of cryptocurrency
sustainability may be to improve consumer education.

data in a way that neither party can cheat. They have various applications such
as the exchange of digital items, or the exchange of digital coins and digital
services between a buyer/client and seller/server.
  In this work, we formally define and propose a generic blockchain-based
construction called ""Recurring Contingent Service Payment"" (RC-S-P). It (i)
lets a fair exchange of digital coins and verifiable service reoccur securely
between clients and a server while ensuring that the server is paid if and only
if it delivers a valid service, and (ii) ensures the parties' privacy is
preserved. RC-S-P supports arbitrary verifiable services, such as ""Proofs of
Retrievability"" (PoR) or verifiable computation and imposes low on-chain
overheads. Our formal treatment and construction, for the first time, consider
the setting where either client or server is malicious.
  We also present a concrete efficient instantiation of RC- S-P when the
verifiable service is PoR. We implemented the concrete instantiation and
analysed its cost. When it deals with a 4-GB outsourced file, a verifier can
check a proof in only 90 milliseconds, and a dispute between a prover and
verifier is resolved in 0.1 milliseconds.
  At CCS 2017, two blockchain-based protocols were proposed to support the fair
exchange of digital coins and a certain verifiable service; namely, PoR. In
this work, we show that these protocols (i) are susceptible to a free-riding
attack which enables a client to receive the service without paying the server,
and (ii) are not suitable for cases where parties' privacy matters, e.g., when
the server's proof status or buyer's file size must remain private from the
public. RC- S-P simultaneously mitigates the above attack and preserves the
parties' privacy.

Wightman function in the geometry of two parallel branes perpendicular to the
AdS boundary. On the separate branes, the field operator is constrained by
Robin boundary conditions, in general, with different coefficients. In the
region between the branes their contribution to the Wightman function is
explicitly separated. By using this decomposition, the brane-induced effects on
the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) for the field squared and energy-momentum
tensor are investigated. The behavior of those expectation values is studied in
various asymptotic regions of the parameters. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor
in addition to the diagonal components has a nonzero off-diagonal stress.
Depending on the boundary conditions and also on the distance from the branes,
the vacuum energy density can be either positive or negative. The Casimir
forces acting on the branes have two components. The first one corresponds to
the standard normal force and the second one is parallel to the branes and
presents the vacuum shear force. Unlike to the problem of parallel plates in
the Minkowski bulk, the normal Casimir forces acting on separate branes differ
if the boundary conditions on the branes are different. They can be either
repulsive or attractive. In a similar way, depending on the coefficients in the
boundary conditions, the shear force is directed toward or from the AdS
boundary. The separate components may also change their signs as functions of
the interbrane separation. At large proper separations between the branes,
compared to the AdS curvature radius, both the components of the Casimir forces
exhibit a power-law decay. For a massive scalar field this behavior is in
contrast to that for the Minkowski bulk, where the decrease is exponential.

the module category of the resolution and the module category of the algebra
being resolved are linked via an exact functor known as Schur functor. In this
paper, we investigate how to measure the quality of the connection between
module categories of (projective) Noetherian algebras, $B$, and module
categories of endomorphism algebras of generators-relative cogenerators over
$B$ which are split quasi-hereditary Noetherian algebras. In particular, we are
interested in finding, if it exists, the highest degree $n$ so that the
endomorphism algebra of a generator-cogenerator provides an $n$-faithful cover,
in the sense of Rouquier, of $B$. The degree $n$ is known as Hemmer-Nakano

ADHD is the theta-to-beta spectral power ratio (TBR) that is based on a
single-channel analysis. However, initial findings for this measure have not
been replicated in other studies. Thus, instead of focusing on single-channel
spectral power, a novel model for investigating interactions (dependence)
between channels in the entire network is proposed. Although dependence
measures such as coherence and partial directed coherence (PDC) are well
explored in studying brain connectivity, these measures only capture linear
dependence. Moreover, in designed clinical experiments, these dependence
measures are observed to vary across subjects even within a homogeneous group.
To address these limitations, we propose the mixed-effects
functional-coefficient autoregressive (MX-FAR) model which captures
between-subject variation by incorporating subject-specific random effects. The
advantages of the MX-FAR model are the following: (1.) it captures potential
non-linear dependence between channels; (2.) it is nonparametric and hence
flexible and robust to model mis-specification; (3.) it can capture differences
between groups when they exist; (4.) it accounts for variation across subjects;
(5.) the framework easily incorporates well-known inference methods from
mixed-effects models; (6.) it can be generalized to accommodate various

introduced as a way of constructing complete and discrete representations of
the rank invariant of the module. In particular, the minimal rank decomposition
by rectangles of a persistence module, also known as the generalized
persistence diagram, gives a uniquely defined representation of the rank
invariant of the module by a pair of rectangle-decomposable modules. This pair
is interpreted as a signed barcode, with the rectangle summands of the first
(resp. second) module playing the role of the positive (resp. negative) bars.
The minimal rank decomposition by rectangles generalizes the concept of
persistence barcode from one-parameter persistence, and, being a discrete
invariant, it is amenable to manipulations on a computer. However, we show that
it is not bottleneck stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck
matching between signed barcodes. To remedy this, we turn our focus to the
signed barcode induced by the Betti numbers of the module relative to the
so-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under
signed matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of
independent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact
structure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence
modules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable
modules, which are in fact the relative projective modules of the rank exact
structure. We also bound the size of the multigraded Betti numbers relative to
the rank exact structure in terms of the usual multigraded Betti numbers, we
prove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the
notion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the
global dimension of a different exact structure that is related to the upsets

general ontology of reality as related to software engineering (e.g., UML
classes). Such a venture is similar to many studies in which researchers have
enhanced modeling through ontological analysis of the underlying paradigm of
UML models. We attempt to develop a conceptual model that consists of a
foundation of things that is supplemented with a second level of designated
objects. According to some researchers, the problem of the difference between
things and objects is one of the most decisive issues for the conception of
reality. In software engineering, objects serve two purposes: they promote
understanding of the real world and provide a practical basis for computer
implementation. The notion of object plays a central role in the
object-oriented approach, in which other notions are viewed by decomposing them
into objects and their relationships. This paper contributes to the
establishment of a broader understanding of the notion of object in conceptual
modeling based on things that are simultaneously machines. In this study, we
explored the underlying hypothesis of conceptual models (e.g., UML) to enhance
their ontological analysis by using the thing/machine (TM) model, which
presents the domain as thimacs. Following the philosophical distinction between
things and objects, we can specify modeling at two levels: the thinging stage
and the objectification stage. Objects are thimacs that control the
handleablity of their sub-parts when interacting with the outside of the object
(analogous to the body parts holding together in an assemblage when interacting
with the outside). The results promise a more refined modeling process to
develop a high-level description of the involved domain.

platform providers can address this issue by enabling collaboration within
their OGD ecosystems, both in terms of the OGD published on the underpinning

Method: We conducted an exploratory multiple-case study of four OGD ecosystems
with diverse characteristics. Data was collected through semi-structured
interviews, and in one of the cases through a prolonged engagement. The data
was then coded using a set of \textit{apriori} codes. Results: The study
descriptively presents each case based on the coding, along with synthesis in
the form of a conceptual model that highlights different attributes of OGD
ecosystems. For example, we observe how collaboration can be enabled through
different types of ownership of the platform provider, how the ecosystem's
scope can vary, what roles the platform provider may undertake, how to enable
open collaboration, and how to collaborate in terms of data sharing, OSS
development, and standards. For each aspect, we provide recommendations based
on the explored cases that, together with the model, may help public entities
in designing and orchestrating new or existing OGD ecosystems. Conclusions: We
conclude that enabling and facilitating collaboration in an OGD ecosystem is a
complex exercise, yet believe that it offers new ways for public entities in

The learned covariance kernel functions have great advantages over existing

closely-eluting peaks, necessitating sophisticated methods for analysis. Some
of these methods are fully automated, but make some assumptions about the data
which can introduce artifacts during the analysis. Chemometric methods such as
Multivariate Curve Resolution, or Parallel Factor Analysis are particularly
attractive, since they are flexible and make relatively few assumptions about
the data - ideally resulting in fewer artifacts. These methods do require
expert user intervention to determine the most relevant regions of interest and
an appropriate number of components, $k$, for each region. Automated region of
interest selection is needed to permit automated batch processing of

method for automated, untargeted region of interest selection that accounts for
the multivariate information present in GC-MS data to select regions of
interest based on the ratio of the squared first, and second singular values
from the Singular Value Decomposition of a window that moves across the
chromatogram. Assuming that the first singular value accounts largely for

possible to interpret the relationship between these two values as a
probabilistic distribution of Fisher Ratios. The sensitivity of the algorithm

implies that it will be the 2-localization of $\mathscr{A}$ at $\Sigma$ as soon

This is then used to obtain 2-localizations of a model category

exhibit large kinetic inductance (KI), high critical temperature, and large
quality factors at the single-photon level. KI nonlinearity can be exploited as
an alternative to Josephson junctions for creating novel nonlinear quantum
devices with the potential to operate at higher frequencies and at elevated
temperatures. We study a means of magnifying KI nonlinearity by confining the
current density of resonant electromagnetic modes in nanowires with a small
volume $V \simeq 10^{-4}\text{um}^3$. Using this concept, we realize
microwave-frequency Kerr cavities with a maximum Kerr-shift per photon of
$K/2\pi = 123.5 \pm 3$ kHz and report a nonlinearity-to-linewidth ratio
$K/\gamma = 21\%$. With improved design, our devices are expected to approach
the regime of strong quantum nonlinearity in the millimeter-wave spectrum.

symbolic models for natural language inference, an EG cannot recover if missing

problem of vertex sparsity by introducing a new method of graph smoothing,
using a Language Model to find the nearest approximations of missing

two difficult directional entailment datasets while exceeding average

We further analyze language model embeddings and discuss why they are naturally
suitable for premise-smoothing, but not hypothesis-smoothing. Finally, we
formalize a theory for smoothing a symbolic inference method by constructing
transitive chains to smooth both the premise and hypothesis.

forceful manipulation, we augment an existing task and motion planner with

opening a childproof bottle, twisting a nut and cutting a vegetable, we

particle pairs disperse away from each other at a continuously growing rate,
with mean squared separation that obeys an algebraic growth in time with an
exponent of 3. However, unequivocal direct observations of this law have proved
elusive in experiments and simulations, due to a complex dependence on
parameters and limitations in the achievable Reynolds number, so it still
awaits experimental verification. Here, we show that turbulent
super-diffusivity can be identified unambiguously through the angle formed
between the separation and relative velocity vectors. We demonstrate that this
angle is a scale-independent, universal constant of turbulence that renders the
Richardson law fully accessible for experimental verification despite the
inherent difficulties. This discovery has implications for our understanding of
many processes where turbulence drives super-diffusive spreading of matter,
from plankton in the ocean to rain formation in clouds.

challenging for wheeled robots, such as stairs or highly uneven surfaces.
However, quadruped robots face stability challenges on slippery surfaces. This
can be resolved by adjusting the robot's locomotion by switching to more
conservative and stable locomotion modes, such as crawl mode (where three feet
are in contact with the ground always) or amble mode (where one foot touches
down at a time) to prevent potential falls. To tackle these challenges, we
propose an approach to learn a model from past robot experience for predictive
detection of potential failures. Accordingly, we trigger gait switching merely
based on proprioceptive sensory information. To learn this predictive model, we
propose a semi-supervised process for detecting and annotating ground truth
slip events in two stages: We first detect abnormal occurrences in the time
series sequences of the gait data using an unsupervised anomaly detector, and
then, the anomalies are verified with expert human knowledge in a replay
simulation to assert the event of a slip. These annotated slip events are then
used as ground truth examples to train an ensemble decision learner for
predicting slip probabilities across terrains for traversability. We analyze
our model on data recorded by a legged robot on multiple sites with slippery
terrain. We demonstrate that a potential slip event can be predicted up to 720
ms ahead of a potential fall with an average precision greater than 0.95 and an
average F-score of 0.82. Finally, we validate our approach in real-time by
deploying it on a legged robot and switching its gait mode based on slip event

livestock are vaccinated, interactions with reservoir species still result in
spill-over cases to cattle. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine has indicated that modeling efforts should focus on the transmission
between elk and cattle and should be conducted to better understand the effects
of land-use change and landscape configuration on disease risk. This chapter
determines how the landscape's configuration, using the shape and amount of
habitat overlap between elk and cattle, contributes to cross-species
brucellosis transmission, and how land-use change translates to disease
prevalence. A mathematical-epidemiological model is combined with landscape
ecology metrics to estimate transmission rates between the species and model

In quantum mechanics, coherence, entanglement, and Bell nonlocality are

${\cal E}(\varrho)$, both arbitrary, it is a hard task to determine ${\cal
E}(\varrho^{\otimes N})$. However, if the figure of merit $\cal{E}$ turns out
to be additive, we simply have ${\cal E}(\varrho^{\otimes N})=N e$, with
$e={\cal E}(\varrho)$. In this work we generalize this useful notion through
the inner product ${\cal E}(\varrho^{\otimes N}) = \vec{N}\cdot \vec{e}$, where

Neural Networks (SNNs), and optimization techniques, e.g., quantization and
pruning for compressed networks. However, the deployment of these innovative
models and optimization techniques introduces possible reliability issues,
which is a pillar for DNNs to be widely used in safety-critical applications,
e.g., autonomous driving. Moreover, scaling technology nodes have the
associated risk of multiple faults happening at the same time, a possibility
not addressed in state-of-the-art resiliency analyses.
  Towards better reliability analysis for DNNs, we present enpheeph, a Fault
Injection Framework for Spiking and Compressed DNNs. The enpheeph framework
enables optimized execution on specialized hardware devices, e.g., GPUs, while
providing complete customizability to investigate different fault models,
emulating various reliability constraints and use-cases. Hence, the faults can
be executed on SNNs as well as compressed networks with minimal-to-none
modifications to the underlying code, a feat that is not achievable by other
state-of-the-art tools.
  To evaluate our enpheeph framework, we analyze the resiliency of different
DNN and SNN models, with different compression techniques. By injecting a
random and increasing number of faults, we show that DNNs can show a reduction
in accuracy with a fault rate as low as 7 x 10 ^ (-7) faults per parameter,
with an accuracy drop higher than 40%. Run-time overhead when executing
enpheeph is less than 20% of the baseline execution time when executing 100 000
faults concurrently, at least 10x lower than state-of-the-art frameworks,
making enpheeph future-proof for complex fault injection scenarios.

inferable participant states; a counterfactual perturbation to the state; and
the changes to the story that would be necessary if the counterfactual was
true. We introduce three state-based reasoning tasks that test for the ability
to infer when a state is entailed by a story, revise a story for a
counterfactual state, and to explain the most likely state change given a

which translates to increased energy consumption, is the foremost obstacle
towards deploying large DNNs in resource-constrained systems. Fixed-Point (FP)
implementations achieved through post-training quantization are commonly used
to curtail the energy consumption of these networks. However, the uniform
quantization intervals in FP restrict the bit-width of data structures to large
values due to the need to represent most of the numbers with sufficient
resolution and avoid high quantization errors. In this paper, we leverage the
key insight that (in most of the scenarios) DNN weights and activations are
mostly concentrated near zero and only a few of them have large magnitudes. We
propose CoNLoCNN, a framework to enable energy-efficient low-precision deep
convolutional neural network inference by exploiting: (1) non-uniform
quantization of weights enabling simplification of complex multiplication
operations; and (2) correlation between activation values enabling partial
compensation of quantization errors at low cost without any run-time overheads.
To significantly benefit from non-uniform quantization, we also propose a novel
data representation format, Encoded Low-Precision Binary Signed Digit, to
compress the bit-width of weights while ensuring direct use of the encoded
weight for processing using a novel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit design.

functions for directed and undirected rule extraction from artificial neural
network operations. Firstly, I defined comprehensive functions, then
constructed a comprehensive multilayer network (denoted as $N$). Each
activation function of $N$ is parametrized to a comprehensive function.
Following $N$ construction, I extracted rules from the network by observing
that the network output depends on probabilities of composite functions that
are comprehensive functions. This functional rule extraction method applies to
the perceptron and multilayer neural network. For any $N$ model that is trained
to predict some outcome given some event, that model behaviour can be expressed
â using the functional rule extraction method â as a formal rule or informal
rule obeyed by the network to predict that outcome. As example, figure 1
consist of a comprehensive physics function that is parameter for one of the
network hidden activation functions. Using the functional rule extraction
method, I deduced that the comprehensive multilayer network prediction depends
on probability of that physics function and probabilities of other composite
comprehensive functions in $N$. Additionally, functional rule extraction method
can aid in applied settings for generation of equations of learned phenomena.
This generation can be achieved by first training an $N$ model toward
predicting outcome of a phenomenon, then extracting the rules and assuming that
probability values of the network comprehensive functions are constants.
Finally, to simplify the generated equation, comprehensive functions with
probability $p = 0$ can be omitted.

  Designs of Classics",,,,,"cs.PL cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Static analysis is a mature field with applications to bug detection,
security analysis, and code optimization, etc. To facilitate these
applications, static analysis frameworks play an essential role by providing a
series of fundamental services such as program abstraction, control flow graph
construction, and points-to/alias information computation, etc. However,
despite impressive progress of static analysis, and this field has seen several
popular frameworks in the last decades, it is still not clear how a static
analysis framework should be designed in a way that analysis developers could
benefit more: for example, what a good IR (for analysis) ought to look like?
What functionalities should the module of fundamental analyses provide to ease
client analyses? How to develop and integrate new analysis conveniently? How to
manage multiple analyses?
  To answer these questions, in this work, we discuss the design trade-offs for
the crucial components of a static analysis framework, and argue for the most
appropriate design by following the HBDC (Harnessing the Best Designs of
Classics) principle: for each crucial component, we compare the design choices
made for it (possibly) by different classic frameworks such as Soot, WALA,
SpotBugs and Doop, and choose arguably the best one, but if none is good
enough, we then propose a better design. These selected or newly proposed
designs finally constitute Tai-e, a new static analysis framework for Java.
Specifically, Tai-e is novel in the designs of several aspects like IR, pointer
analysis and development of new analyses, etc., leading to an easy-to-learn,
easy-to-use and efficient system. To our knowledge, this is the first work that
systematically explores the designs and implementations of various static
analysis frameworks, and we believe it provides useful materials and viewpoints
for building better static analysis infrastructures.

Neural Networks (GNNs) possess the powerful capacity of relational modeling,
they have an inherent advantage in the field of multimodal learning. GNNs
leverage the graph constructed from multimodal data to perform intra- and
inter-modal information interaction, which effectively facilitates the
integration and complementation of multimodal data. In this work, we propose a
novel Graph network based Multimodal Fusion Technique (GraphMFT) for emotion

each data object is regarded as a node, and both intra- and inter-modal
dependencies existing between data objects can be regarded as edges. GraphMFT
utilizes multiple improved graph attention networks to capture intra-modal
contextual information and inter-modal complementary information. In addition,
the proposed GraphMFT attempts to address the challenges of existing
graph-based multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) models such as
MMGCN. Empirical results on two public multimodal datasets reveal that our

flat end mirrors that was pumped with a laser diode whose focused spot size was
larger than the lasing beam spot size determined by the thermal lens effect.
The photon lifetimes of the laser oscillations were found to be greatly
shortened to \tau_{p} = 6.74 ps as compared with those in pure TEM00 mode
operation, while the fluorescence lifetime was \tau = 130 \mu s. The formation
of the peculiar transverse mode was theoretically treated in terms of the

burning of population inversions due to the preceding transverse eigenmode

complementary electrical signals to encode information. This allows a receiver
to reject any noise by looking at the difference between the two signals,
assuming the noise affects both signals in the same way. Many protocols such as
USB, Ethernet, and HDMI use differential signaling to achieve a robust
communication channel in a noisy environment. This generally works well and has
led many to believe that it is infeasible to remotely inject attacking signals
into such a differential pair. In this paper we challenge this assumption and
show that an adversary can in fact inject malicious signals from a distance,
purely using common-mode injection, i.e., injecting into both wires at the same
time. We show how this allows an attacker to inject bits or even arbitrary
messages into a communication line. Such an attack is a significant threat to
many applications, from home security and privacy to automotive systems,
critical infrastructure, or implantable medical devices; in which incorrect
data or unauthorized control could cause significant damage, or even fatal
accidents.
  We show in detail the principles of how an electromagnetic signal can bypass
the noise rejection of differential signaling, and eventually result in
incorrect bits in the receiver. We show how an attacker can exploit this to
achieve a successful injection of an arbitrary bit, and we analyze the success
rate of injecting longer arbitrary messages. We demonstrate the attack on a
real system and show that the success rate can reach as high as $90\%$.
Finally, we present a case study where we wirelessly inject a message into a
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, which is a differential signaling bus
protocol used in many critical applications, including the automotive and
aviation sector.

information only with its neighbors and only intermittent (rather than
continuous) states and input are to be utilized. Thus far to our best

fashion by combining the philosophy of the modified congelation of variables
based approach with the special treatment of non-triangular structural
uncertainties, which avoids the derivative of time-varying parameters and
eliminates the limitation of the triangular condition, thus largely broadens
the scope of application. By making use of the important property that the
partial derivatives of the constructed virtual controllers in each subsystem
are all constant, the second scheme is developed through directly replacing the
states in the preceding scheme with the triggered ones. Consequently, the
non-differentiability of the virtual control stemming from intermittent state
feedback is completely obviated. The internal signals under both schemes are
rigorously shown to be globally uniformly bounded with the aid of several novel
lemmas, while the stabilization performance can be enhanced by appropriately
adjusting design parameters. Moreover, the inter-event intervals are ensured to
be lower-bounded by a positive constant. Finally, numerical simulation verifies
the benefits and efficiency of the proposed method.

realizing vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs). This work makes the first
attempt at quantitatively measuring the quality of heterogeneous information
fusion in VCPS by designing a new metric called Age of View (AoV).
Specifically, we derive a sensing model based on a multi-class M/G/1 priority
queue and a transmission model based on Shannon theory. On this basis, we
formally define AoV by modeling the timeliness, completeness, and consistency
of the heterogeneous information fusion in VCPS and formulate the problem
aiming to minimize the system's average AoV. Further, we propose a new solution
called Multi-agent Difference-Reward-based deep reinforcement learning with a
Greedy Bandwidth Allocation (MDR-GBA) to solve the problem. In particular, each
vehicle acts as an independent agent and decides the sensing frequencies and
uploading priorities of heterogeneous information. Meanwhile, the roadside unit
(RSU) decides the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) bandwidth allocation for each
vehicle based on a greedy scheme. Finally, we build the simulation model and
compare the performance of the proposed solution with state-of-the-art
algorithms. The experimental results conclusively demonstrate the significance
of the new metric and the superiority of the proposed solution.

polymer composites. We report an ultra-high enhancement of 4030% in thermal
conductivity of polyetherimide/graphene nanocomposite (k = 9.5 Wm-1K-1)
prepared through the use of EG with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an auxiliary
intercalating agent at 10 wt% compositions (k of pure polyetherimide ~ 0.23
Wm-1K-1). This ultra-high thermal conductivity value is found to be due to an
EG-mediated interconnected graphene network throughout the composite,
establishing a percolative environment that enables highly efficient thermal
transport in the composite. Comparative studies were also performed using
sodium chlorate (NaClO3) as an auxiliary intercalating agent. At 10 wt%
composition, NaClO3 intercalated EG was found to lead to a smaller enhancement
of 2190% in k of composite. Detailed characterization performed to elucidate
this advantage, revealed that hydrogen peroxide led to primarily edge oxidation
of graphene sheets within EG, leaving the basal plane intact, thus preserving
the ultra-high in-plane thermal conductivity of ~ 2000 Wm-1K-1. Sodium
chlorate, on the other hand, led to a higher degree of oxidation, with a large
number of oxygen groups on the basal plane of graphene, dramatically lowering
its in-plane thermal conductivity. Thermal diffusivity of H2O2 prepared EG
paper was measured to be 9.5 mm2/s while that of NaClO3 case was measured to be
6.7 mm2/s, thus directly confirming the beneficial impact of H2O2 on k of
graphene itself. This study is the first to address the role of intercalating
agents on k of expanded graphite/polymer composites and has led to the
discovery of H2O2 as an effective intercalating agent for achieving ultra-high

and mining industries. In this study, methane detonation propagation in dilute
coal char particle suspensions is studied based on Eulerian-Lagrangian method.
The effects of char combustion on methane detonation dynamics are focused on.
The results show that propagation of the methane detonation wave in coal
particle suspensions are considerably affected by particle concentration and
size. Detonation extinction occurs when the coal particle size is small and
concentration is high. The averaged lead shock speed generally decreases with
increased particle concentration and decreased particle size. Mean structure
and interphase coupling of hybrid detonation are analysed, based on the gas and
particle quantities. It is found that char combustion proceeds in the subsonic
region behind the detonation wave and heat release is relatively distributed
compared to that from gas phase reaction. The mass and energy transfer rates
increase rapidly to the maximum near the reaction front in the induction zone.
Moreover, for 1 {\mu}m particles, if the particle concentration is beyond a
threshold value, detonation re-initiation occurs after it is quenched at the
beginning of the coal dust suspensions. This is caused by hot spots from the
shock focusing along the reaction front in a decoupled detonation and these
shocks are generated from char combustion behind the lead shock.

strategies and applications. However, challenges such as interpretability,
explainability, robustness, safety, trust, and sensibility remain unsolved in
neural network technologies, despite the fact that they will unavoidably be
addressed for critical applications. Attempts have been made to overcome the
challenges in neural network computing by representing and embedding domain
knowledge in terms of symbolic representations. Thus, the neuro-symbolic
learning (NeSyL) notion emerged, which incorporates aspects of symbolic
representation and bringing common sense into neural networks (NeSyL). In
domains where interpretability, reasoning, and explainability are crucial, such
as video and image captioning, question-answering and reasoning, health
informatics, and genomics, NeSyL has shown promising outcomes. This review
presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art NeSyL approaches, their
principles, advances in machine and deep learning algorithms, applications such
as opthalmology, and most importantly, future perspectives of this emerging
field.

ultracompact minihalos~(UCMHs) on the cosmic ionization history using the
Planck observation data. Although high-redshift astrophysics is not understood
yet, UCMHs could host the Pop.~III stars like the halos formed in the standard
structure formation scenario. Such Pop.~III stars would emit ionizing photons
during their main sequence and facilitate cosmic reionization in high
redshifts. To study their effects on the global ionization, we model the cosmic
reionization evolution based on the ``tanh""-type reionization model which is
expressed by $z_{\mathrm{reio}}$ with additional two parameters characterizing
the initial mass of UCMHs and the number density of UCMHs. We implement the
Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis with the latest Planck observation data for
our reionization model. As the result, we found that if the UCMH initial mass
is larger than $10^{8.4}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, the number density of UCMHs is
strictly limited. Then we obtained the constraint on the amplitude of the
primordial power spectrum through the constraint on the UCMH number density
like $\mathcal{A}_{\zeta}\lesssim 10^{-8}$ in the scales, $k\lesssim
50\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, when we assume that the standard ``tanh""-type
reionization occurs by $z=3$, so that we set $z_{\mathrm{reio}}>3$.

made to the camera. The first important one concerns the total noise of the
camera. Limited to 1.75 microns wavelength cut-off with proper cold filters,
looking at a blackbody at room temperature and f/4 beam aperture, we now
measure total noise down to 0.6 e at gain 50 in CDS mode 1720 FPS, dividing
previous noise figure by a factor 2. The total camera background of 30-400 e/s
is now achieved with a factor 3 of background reduction, the camera also
looking at a room temperature blackbody with an F/4 beam aperture. Image bias
oscillations, due to electronics grounding scheme, were carefully analyzed and
removed. Focal plane detector vibrations transmitted by the pulse tube cooling
machine were also analyzed, damped and measured down to 0.3 microns RMS,
reducing focal plane vibrations by a factor 3. In addition, a vacuum getter of
higher capacity is now used to offer camera operation without camera pumping
during months. The camera main characteristics are detailed: pulse tube cooling
at 80K with limited vibrations, permanent vacuum solution, ultra-low latency
Cameralink full data interface, safety management of the camera by firmware,
online firmware update, ambient liquid cooling and reduced weight of 20 kg.

introduce an analytically tractable model of group formation where individuals
have multidimensional binary opinions and the group grows through a noisy
homophily principle, i.e., like-minded individuals attract each other with
exceptions occurring with some small probability. Assuming that the level of
disagreement is correlated with the number of different opinions coexisting

disagreement emerges spontaneously regardless of how small the noise in the

We also show that the model outcomes are robust under different group growth

software-defined networking (SDN) is tailored as a multi-objective optimization
problem, and an intelligent multicast routing algorithm DRL-M4MR based on the
deep Q network (DQN) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is designed to
construct a multicast tree in SDN. First, the multicast tree state matrix, link
bandwidth matrix, link delay matrix, and link packet loss rate matrix are
designed as the state space of the DRL agent by combining the global view and
control of the SDN. Second, the action space of the agent is all the links in
the network, and the action selection strategy is designed to add the links to
the current multicast tree under four cases. Third, single-step and final
reward function forms are designed to guide the intelligence to make decisions
to construct the optimal multicast tree. The experimental results show that,
compared with existing algorithms, the multicast tree construct by DRL-M4MR can
obtain better bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate performance after
training, and it can make more intelligent multicast routing decisions in a

math to describe objective indefiniteness that at the set level is the math of
partitions. The key analytical concepts are definiteness versus indefiniteness,
distinctions versus indistinctions, and distinguishability versus
indistinguishability. The key machinery to go from indefinite to more definite
states is the partition join operation at the set level that prefigures at the
quantum level projective measurement as well as the formation of
maximally-definite state descriptions by Dirac's Complete Sets of Commuting
Operators (CSCOs). This development is measured quantitatively by logical
entropy at the set level and by quantum logical entropy at the quantum level.

agents, then the asymptotic outcome under an obedient recommendation policy
coincides with the one-shot outcome. We report findings from an experiment with
one participant at a time engaged in repeated route choice decision on

each route, a route recommendation generated by an obedient policy, and a
rating suggestive of average experience of previous participants with the
quality of recommendation. Upon entering route choice, the actual travel times
are revealed. The participant evaluates the quality of recommendation by
submitting a review. This is combined with historical reviews to update rating
for the next round. Data analysis from 33 participants each with 100 rounds

paper, we introduce a Python Vasculature BioMarker toolbox, denoted PVBM. A
total of 11 VBMs were implemented. In particular, we introduce new algorithmic
methods to estimate tortuosity and branching angles. Using PVBM, and as a proof
of usability, we analyze geometric vascular differences between glaucomatous
patients and healthy controls. Results: We built a fully automated vasculature

to characterize the vascular changes in glaucoma. For arterioles and venules,
all biomarkers were significant and lower in glaucoma patients compared to
healthy controls except for tortuosity, venular singularity length and venular

pinned impurities are studied, and results are compared with those from
irregularly trapped system of particles. While the disorder of first type leads
to diffusive single-particle dynamics, the motion of a single particle in an
irregular trap is chaotic but ballistic. The many-particle system does not
differentiate between these two models of disorder insofar as their qualitative
properties are concerned -- particularly for describing the thermal melting of
the underlying Coulomb-""solid"". However, quantitative differences persist --
the relaxation time scales differ significantly by tuning impurity

  Prediction in Autonomous Driving",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Forecasting the future states of surrounding traffic participants is a
crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The recently proposed occupancy
flow field prediction introduces a scalable and effective representation to
jointly predict surrounding agents' future motions in a scene. However, the
challenging part is to model the underlying social interactions among traffic
agents and the relations between occupancy and flow. Therefore, this paper
proposes a novel Multi-modal Hierarchical Transformer network that fuses the
vectorized (agent motion) and visual (scene flow, map, and occupancy)
modalities and jointly predicts the flow and occupancy of the scene.
Specifically, visual and vector features from sensory data are encoded through
a multi-stage Transformer module and then a late-fusion Transformer module with
temporal pixel-wise attention. Importantly, a flow-guided multi-head
self-attention (FG-MSA) module is designed to better aggregate the information
on occupancy and flow and model the mathematical relations between them. The
proposed method is comprehensively validated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset
and compared against several state-of-the-art models. The results reveal that
our model with much more compact architecture and data inputs than other
methods can achieve comparable performance. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating vectorized agent motion features and the
proposed FG-MSA module. Compared to the ablated model without the FG-MSA
module, which won 2nd place in the 2022 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction
Challenge, the current model shows better separability for flow and occupancy
and further performance improvements.

significant substructure. We present new, highly sensitive radio continuum
observations of Abell 3266 performed with the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (0.8$-$1.1 GHz) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (1.1$-$3.1
GHz). These deep observations provide new insights into recently-reported
diffuse non-thermal phenomena associated with the intracluster medium,
including a 'wrong-way' relic, a fossil plasma source, and an as-yet
unclassified central diffuse ridge, which we reveal comprises the brightest
part of a large-scale radio halo detected here for the first time. The
'wrong-way' relic is highly atypical of its kind: it exhibits many classical
signatures of a shock-related radio relic, while at the same time exhibiting
strong spectral steepening. While radio relics are generally consistent with a
quasi-stationary shock scenario, the 'wrong-way' relic is not. We study the
spectral properties of the fossil plasma source; it exhibits an ultra-steep and
highly curved radio spectrum, indicating an extremely aged electron population.
The larger-scale radio halo fills much of the cluster centre, and presents a
strong connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of the
intracluster medium, along with evidence of substructure. Whether the central
diffuse ridge is simply a brighter component of the halo, or a mini-halo,
remains an open question. Finally, we study the morphological and spectral
properties of the multiple complex radio galaxies in this cluster in
unprecedented detail, tracing their evolutionary history.

spatio-temporal information processing capacity and computational energy

caused by the weights of SNNs has gradually attracted attention. Inspired by
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) quantization technology, binarized SNN (BSNN)
is introduced to solve the memory problem. Due to the lack of suitable learning
algorithms, BSNN is usually obtained by ANN-to-SNN conversion, whose accuracy
will be limited by the trained ANNs. In this paper, we propose an ultra-low
latency adaptive local binary spiking neural network (ALBSNN) with accuracy
loss estimators, which dynamically selects the network layers to be binarized
to ensure the accuracy of the network by evaluating the error caused by the
binarized weights during the network learning process. Experimental results
show that this method can reduce storage space by more than 20 % without losing
network accuracy. At the same time, in order to accelerate the training speed
of the network, the global average pooling(GAP) layer is introduced to replace
the fully connected layers by the combination of convolution and pooling, so
that SNNs can use a small number of time steps to obtain better recognition
accuracy. In the extreme case of using only one time step, we still can achieve
92.92 %, 91.63 % ,and 63.54 % testing accuracy on three different datasets,

subject to speckle, which for certain applications can make the detection of
tissue irregularities difficult. To cope with this, it is common practice to
apply speckle reduction filters to the images. Most conventional filtering
techniques are fairly hand-crafted and often need to be finely tuned to the
present hardware, imaging scheme and application. Learning based techniques on
the other hand suffer from the need for a target image for training (in case of
fully supervised techniques) or require narrow, complex physics-based models of
the speckle appearance that might not apply in all cases. With this work we
propose a deep-learning based method for speckle removal without these
limitations. To enable this, we make use of realistic ultrasound simulation
techniques that allow for instantiation of several independent speckle
realizations that represent the exact same tissue, thus allowing for the
application of image reconstruction techniques that work with pairs of
differently corrupted data. Compared to two other state-of-the-art approaches

performs favorably in qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluation,

In particular, the gauge principle in momentum space is based on a covariant

simultaneously from Kaluza-Klein reduction of a higher-dimensional geometry
exhibiting curvature in momentum space. The interplay of the emerging gauge
fields as well as the remaining curved momentum space at lowest order lead to
modifications of the Heisenberg algebra. While the gauge fields imply
Moyal-type noncommutativity dependent on the analogue field strength tensor,

two regularization parameters. We consider an extended phase space formalism

configuration variables, constrained to be functions of the black hole mass. We
generalize this restriction, allowing for an off-shell phase space dependence.
We then introduce a gauge fixing procedure and reduce the system, proving that
the reduced symplectic structure cannot reproduce the standard relativistic one
in terms of the densitized triad and the Ashtekar-Barbero connection. Actually,
the reduced structure precisely compensates the modifications that arise in the
Hamilton equations when the regularization parameters are treated as phase
space functions, rather than as numbers, attaining a consistent Hamiltonian
derivation of the dynamics. We then choose the extended phase space formalism
as starting point to address the loop quantization of the model. Taking the
definition of certain geometric operators as the only basic ingredient and
adopting prescriptions that have proven successful in loop quantum cosmology,
we construct a polymer representation of all the constraints and deduce the
formal expression of the physical states, assuming reasonable spectral
properties for the constraint operators. The physical states turn out to be
characterized by a wave function of the black hole mass with support on a very
specific set. We finally discuss conditions that guarantee the existence of
physical states in the region of large black hole masses. This is a first step
in the development of a new loop quantum theory of black holes.

energy density or radiation produced at the end of inflation. But, the
non-existence of minima does not necessarily mean destabilization of moduli. In
fact, the destabilization of moduli is always dependent on the initial field
values of the fields. In this work, we study carefully how the effects of
reheating ease the problem of moduli destabilization. The associated time scale
to produce the thermal bath allows a larger initial field range to stabilize
the field. Contrary to the usual notion, the allowed initial field range is
larger for higher temperatures when the effective potential is of a run-away
nature. This eases the moduli destabilization problem for heavy mass moduli.
For low mass moduli ($\lesssim$ 30 TeV), the allowed field range still causes
the cosmological moduli problem by violating the BBN constraints unless its
initial abundance is suppressed.

paper, we propose a robust deep learning framework for real-world SR that
randomly erases potential adversarial noises in the frequency domain of input
images or features. The rationale is that on the SR task clean images or
features have a different pattern from the attacked ones in the frequency
domain. Observing that existing adversarial attacks usually add high-frequency
noises to input images, we introduce a novel random frequency mask module that
blocks out high-frequency components possibly containing the harmful
perturbations in a stochastic manner. Since the frequency masking may not only
destroys the adversarial perturbations but also affects the sharp details in a
clean image, we further develop an adversarial sample classifier based on the
frequency domain of images to determine if applying the proposed mask module.
Based on the above ideas, we devise a novel real-world image SR framework that
combines the proposed frequency mask modules and the proposed adversarial
classifier with an existing super-resolution backbone network. Experiments show
that our proposed method is more insensitive to adversarial attacks and
presents more stable SR results than existing models and defenses.

of applications. However, current scene text recognition methods mainly focus
on irregular text while have not explored artistic text specifically. The
challenges of artistic text recognition include the various appearance with
special-designed fonts and effects, the complex connections and overlaps
between characters, and the severe interference from background patterns. To
alleviate these problems, we propose to recognize the artistic text at three
levels. Firstly, corner points are applied to guide the extraction of local
features inside characters, considering the robustness of corner structures to
appearance and shape. In this way, the discreteness of the corner points cuts
off the connection between characters, and the sparsity of them improves the
robustness for background interference. Secondly, we design a character
contrastive loss to model the character-level feature, improving the feature
representation for character classification. Thirdly, we utilize Transformer to
learn the global feature on image-level and model the global relationship of
the corner points, with the assistance of a corner-query cross-attention
mechanism. Besides, we provide an artistic text dataset to benchmark the
performance. Experimental results verify the significant superiority of our
proposed method on artistic text recognition and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several blurred and perspective datasets.

  for quasi-Newton methods in stochastic optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using quasi-Newton methods in stochastic optimization is not a trivial task.
In deterministic optimization, these methods are often a common choice due to
their excellent performance regardless of the problem's condition number.
However, standard quasi-Newton methods fail to extract curvature information
from noisy gradients in stochastic optimization. Moreover, pre-conditioning
noisy gradient observations tend to amplify the noise by a factor given by the
largest eigenvalue of the pre-conditioning matrix. We propose a Bayesian
approach to obtain a Hessian matrix approximation for stochastic optimization
that minimizes the secant equations residue while retaining the smallest
eigenvalue above a specified limit. Thus, the proposed approach assists
stochastic gradient descent to converge to local minima without augmenting
gradient noise. The prior distribution is modeled as the exponential of the
negative squared distance to the previous Hessian approximation, in the
Frobenius sense, with logarithmic barriers imposing extreme eigenvalues
constraints. The likelihood distribution is derived from the secant equations,
i.e., the probability of obtaining the observed gradient evaluations for a
given candidate Hessian approximation. We propose maximizing the log-posterior
using the Newton-CG method. Numerical results on a stochastic quadratic
function and a $\ell_2$ regularized logistic regression problem are presented.
In all the cases tested, our approach improves the convergence of stochastic
gradient descent, compensating for the overhead of solving the log-posterior
maximization. In particular, pre-conditioning the stochastic gradient with the
inverse of our Hessian approximation becomes more advantageous the larger the
condition number of the problem is.

more difficult. Existing algorithms, both classical and deep-learning based,
are not designed for this condition. When the photon shot noise is strong,
conventional deconvolution methods fail because (1) the image does not have
enough signal-to-noise ratio to perform the blur estimation; (2) While deep
neural networks are powerful, many of them do not consider the forward process.
When the noise is strong, these networks fail to simultaneously deblur and
denoise; (3) While iterative schemes are known to be robust in the classical
frameworks, they are seldom considered in deep neural networks because it
requires a differentiable non-blind solver.
  This paper addresses the above challenges by presenting an
\emph{unsupervised} blind deconvolution method. At the core of this method is a
reformulation of the general blind deconvolution framework from the
conventional image-kernel alternating minimization to a purely kernel-based
minimization. This kernel-based minimization leads to a new iterative scheme

aiding monitoring and real-time decision making. For several applications in
this sector, the system to be modeled consists of a mix of discrete-event and
continuous processes interacting with each other. Building simulation-based
Digital Twins of such systems necessitates an open, flexible simulation
framework which can support easy modeling and fast simulation of both
continuous and discrete-event components, and their interactions. In this
paper, we present an outline and key design aspects of a Python-based framework
for performing mixed discrete-continuous simulations. The continuous processes
in the system are assumed to be loosely coupled to other components via
pre-defined events. For example, a continuous state variable crossing a
threshold may trigger an external event. Similarly, external events may lead to
a sudden change in the trajectory, state value or boundary conditions in a
continuous process. We first present a systematic events-based interface using
which such interactions can be modeled and simulated. We then discuss
implementation details of the framework along with a detailed example. In our
implementation, the advancement of time is controlled and performed using the
event-stepped engine of SimPy (a popular discrete-event simulation library in
Python). The continuous processes are modelled using existing frameworks with a
Python wrapper providing the events interface. We discuss possible improvements
to the time advancement scheme, a roadmap and use cases for the framework.

(BH) model and recent methodological developments in its fermionic counterpart,
this work deals with the study of the collective dynamics of a lattice Bose gas
beyond the mean-field picture through a quantum description of its elementary
excitations. The Hamiltonian quantization, performed via a Bogoliubov
quadratization of the BH action within the Gutzwiller approach, allows to
expand the effective action of the theory up to second order in the
fluctuations around the mean-field solution, as well as to prefigure the
possibility of identifying the main decay vertices of the collective modes and
other effects that are not evident at the second-order level. This quantum
description extends the standard Bogoliubov approach to the study of superfluid
Bose systems for comprising higher excitation branches, including the Higgs
mode in the superfluid phase, and identifies their physical meaning together
with appropriate observables which could be taken into consideration for their
experimental characterization. The ultimate aim of the quantization procedure
is the determination of fundamental quantities as the depletion of the
condensate and the effective superfluid fraction, which are not accessible by a
mean-field description or not completely characterized in the regime of strong
interactions.

scenario that is deformed by a running vacuum model of dark energy (RVM-DE) has
been interested. In this research, I show that a class of RVM-CDM (cold dark
matter) model can also describe a cyclical cosmology in which the universe
undergoes cycles of expansion to the contraction phase and vice versa. To this
end, following our previous work, I consider one of the most successful class
of RVM-CDM model in bouncing cosmology, $\rho_x=n_0+n_2 H^2 +n_4 H^4$, in which
the power spectral index gets a red tilt and the running of the spectral index
may give a negative value by choosing the appropriate value of parameters
($n_0,~n_2,~n_4$), which is consistent with the cosmological observations. It
is worthwhile to mention that most matter bounce models do not produce this
negative value. However, the main purpose of this article is to investigate the
RVM-CDM model in the turnaround phase. Far from the bounce in a phantom
expanding universe, the turnaround conditions are investigated before the
occurrence of a sudden big rip. By analyzing the Hubble parameter, equation of
state parameter, and deceleration parameter around the turnaround, we show that
a successful turnaround may occur after an expansion in an \textbf{interacting}
case of RVM-CDM by choosing the appropriate value of parameters. A minimum
value for the interaction parameter is obtained and also finds any relation
between other model parameters. Finally, the effect of each parameter on a
turnaround is studied, and we see that the transition time from accelerating to
decelerating expansion can occur earlier for larger values of interaction
parameters. Also, in several graphs, the effect of the second term in DE
density, including $H^2$, is studied, and we see that by increasing its
coefficient, $n_2$, the transition point leads to lower values.

the scientific community, we introduce a novel visualization pipeline with
which they can create and render AR models. We demonstrate our pipeline by
means of finite element results, but note that our pipeline is generally
applicable to data that may be represented through meshed surfaces.
Specifically, we use two open-source software packages, ParaView and Blender.
The models are then rendered through the <model-viewer> platform, which we
access through Android and iOS smartphones. To demonstrate our pipeline, we
build AR models from static and time-series results of finite element
simulations discretized with continuum, shell, and beam elements. Moreover, we
openly provide python scripts to automate this process. Thus, others may use
our framework to create and render AR models for their own research and

the low-energy physics and local densities of states. Many-body localization,
presence or lack of thermalization and quantum chaos are examples of phenomena
in which states at different energy scales, including the highly excited ones,
contribute to the dynamics and therefore affect the system's properties.
Quantifying these contributions requires the many-body density of states
(MBDoS), a function whose calculation becomes challenging even for
non-interacting identical quantum particles due to the difficulty in
enumerating states while enforcing the exchange symmetry. In the present work,
we introduce a new approach to evaluate the MBDoS in the case of systems that
can be mapped into free fermions. The starting point of our method is the
principal component analysis of the filling matrix $F$ describing how $N$
fermions can be configured into $L$ single-particle energy levels. We show that
the many body spectrum can be expanded as a weighted sum of spectra given by
the principal components of the filling matrix. The weighting coefficients only
involve renormalized energies obtained from the single body spectrum. We
illustrate our method in two classes of problems that are mapped into spinless
fermions: (i) non-interacting electrons in a homogeneous tight-binding model in
1D and 2D, and (ii) interacting spins in a chain under a transverse field.
