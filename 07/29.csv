the presence of magnetic inhomogeneities in Ni(1-x)V(x) and, in particular,
recognize the magnetic clusters close to xc, on the paramagnetic and on the
ferromagnetic sides with nontrivial dynamical properties [R. Wang et al., Phys.

polarization analysis of polycrystalline Ni(1-x)V(x) samples with x=0.10 and
x=0.11 with low critical temperatures Tc below 50 K. For both Ni-V samples
close to xc we find isotropic magnetic short-range correlations in the
nanometer-scale persisting at low temperatures. They are suppressed gradually
in higher magnetic fields. In addition, signatures of long-range ordered
magnetic domains are present below Tc. The fraction of these magnetic clusters
embedded in the ferromagnetic ordered phase grows towards xc and agrees well
with the cluster fraction estimate from the magnetization and $\mu$SR data. Our
SANS studies provide new insights into the nature of the inhomogeneities in a

we propose a new compression-aware minimizer dubbed CrAM that modifies the

loss behavior is stable under compression operations such as pruning. Thus,
dense models trained via CrAM should be compressible post-training, in a single
step, without significant accuracy loss. Experimental results on standard
benchmarks, such as residual networks for ImageNet classification and BERT
models for language modelling, show that CrAM produces dense models that can be
more accurate than the standard SGD/Adam-based baselines, but which are stable
under weight pruning: specifically, we can prune models in one-shot to 70-80%
sparsity with almost no accuracy loss, and to 90% with reasonable ($\sim 1\%$)
accuracy loss, which is competitive with gradual compression methods.
Additionally, CrAM can produce sparse models which perform well for transfer
learning, and it also works for semi-structured 2:4 pruning patterns supported
by GPU hardware. The code for reproducing the results is available at

because rehearsing data from previous phases is strictly prohibited, causing
catastrophic forgetting of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we
present iVoro, a holistic framework for CIL, derived from computational
geometry. We found Voronoi Diagram (VD), a classical model for space
subdivision, is especially powerful for solving the CIL problem, because VD
itself can be constructed favorably in an incremental manner -- the newly added
sites (classes) will only affect the proximate classes, making the
non-contiguous classes hardly forgettable. Further, in order to find a better
set of centers for VD construction, we colligate DNN with VD using Power
Diagram and show that the VD structure can be optimized by integrating local
DNN models using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Moreover, our VD construction
is not restricted to the deep feature space, but is also applicable to multiple
intermediate feature spaces, promoting VD to be multi-centered VD (CIVD) that
efficiently captures multi-grained features from DNN. Importantly, iVoro is
also capable of handling uncertainty-aware test-time Voronoi cell assignment
and has exhibited high correlations between geometric uncertainty and
predictive accuracy (up to ~0.9). Putting everything together, iVoro achieves
up to 25.26%, 37.09%, and 33.21% improvements on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and

sufficient to locate all the object instances in the given area, which leads to
inaccurate ambiguity detection. Human intervention is helpful only if the robot
can convey the kind of ambiguity it is facing. In this article, we present DoRO
(Disambiguation of Referred Object), a system that can help an embodied agent
to disambiguate the referred object by raising a suitable query whenever
required. Given an area where the intended object is, DoRO finds all the
instances of the object by aggregating observations from multiple views while
exploring & scanning the area. It then raises a suitable query using the

(CMB) analyses by fitting a simple two-parameter modified blackbody (MBB) model
in each pixel, which nominally accounts for the temperature and opacity of the
dust. While this may be a good approximation for individual dust clouds,
typically a number of such clouds are found along each line of sight and within
each angular pixel, resulting in a superposition of their spectra. In this
paper, we study the effects of this superposition on pixel-based foreground
fitting strategies by modelling the spectral energy distribution (SED) in each
pixel as the integral of individual MBB spectra over various
physically-motivated statistical distributions of dust cloud properties. We
show that fitting these SEDs with the simple two-parameter MBB model generally
results in unbiased estimates of the CMB Stokes Q and U amplitudes in each
pixel, unless there are significant changes in both the dust SED and
polarization angle along the line of sight, in which case significant ($ >
10\sigma$) biases are observed in an illustrative model. We also find that the
best-fit values of the dust temperature, $T_d$, and spectral index, $\beta_d$,
are significantly biased away from the mean/median of the corresponding
statistical distributions when the distributions are broad, suggesting that MBB
model fits can give an unrepresentative picture of the physical properties of
the dust at microwave wavelengths if not interpreted carefully. Using a Fisher
matrix analysis, we also determine the experimental sensitivity required to
recover the parameters of the $T_d$ and $\beta_d$ distributions themselves by
fitting a probabilistic MBB model, finding that only the parameters of broad

  strong coupling and local dynamics",,,"10.1063/5.0101528",,"physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A model designed to mimic the implications of the collective optical response
of molecular ensembles in optical cavities on molecular vibronic dynamics is
investigated. Strong molecule-radiation field coupling is often reached when a
large number N of molecules respond collectively to the radiation field. In
electronic strong coupling, molecular nuclear dynamics following polariton
excitation reflects (a) the timescale separation between the fast electronic
and photonic dynamics and the slow nuclear motion on one hand, and (b) the
interplay between the collective nature of the molecule-field coupling and the
local nature of the molecules nuclear response on the other. The first implies
that the electronic excitation takes place, in the spirit of the Born
approximation, at an approximately fixed nuclear configuration. The second can
be rephrased as the intriguing question, can the collective nature of the
optical excitation lead to collective nuclear motion following polariton
formation, resulting in so-called polaron decoupled dynamics. We address this
issue by studying the dynamical properties of a simplified
Holstein-Tavis-Cummings type model, in which boson modes representing molecular
vibrations are replaced by two-level systems while the boson frequency and the
vibronic coupling are represented by the coupling between these levels (that
induces Rabi oscillations between them) and electronic state dependence of this
coupling. We investigate the short-time behavior of this model following
polariton excitation as well as its response to CW driving and its density of
states spectrum. We find that, while some aspects of the dynamical behavior
appear to adhere to the polaron decoupling picture, the observed dynamics
mostly reflect the local nature of the nuclear configuration of the electronic
polariton rather than this picture.

equilibrium presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics.
Generically, it is expected that non-integrable quantum systems thermalize as
they comply with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)}. A notable
exception to this is the phenomenon of many-body localization, where the
emergence of local conserved quantities prevents thermalization, which has been
observed in finite low-dimensional systems. We study an ensemble of Heisenberg
spins with a tunable distribution of random coupling strengths realized by a
Rydberg quantum simulator. The total magnetization as a function of external
field after a quench serves as a probe for thermalization. We find that such an
isolated quantum system exhibits a non-thermalizing regime despite being
non-integrable. It is shown that thermalization can be restored by reducing the
disorder in the coupling strengths. As our system consists of up to 4000 spins,
we thus show that closed quantum systems can fail to reach thermal equilibrium
even at system sizes approaching the thermodynamic limit.

establish a correspondence, near $\mathscr{I}$, between such spacetimes and
their conformal boundary data on $\mathscr{I}$. More specifically, given a
domain $\mathscr{D} \subset \mathscr{I}$, we prove that the coefficients
$\mathfrak{g}^{(0)} = \mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{g}^{(n)}$ (the undetermined
term or stress energy tensor) in a Fefferman-Graham expansion of the metric $g$
from the boundary uniquely determine $g$ near $\mathscr{D}$, provided
$\mathscr{D}$ satisfies a generalised null convexity condition (GNCC). The GNCC
is a conformally invariant criterion on $\mathscr{D}$, first identified by
Chatzikaleas and the second author, that ensures a foliation of pseudoconvex
hypersurfaces in $\mathscr{M}$ near $\mathscr{D}$, and with the pseudoconvexity
degenerating in the limit at $\mathscr{D}$. As a corollary of this result, we
deduce that conformal symmetries of $( \mathfrak{g}^{(0)}, \mathfrak{g}^{(n)}

spacetimes symmetries near $\mathscr{D}$. The proof, which does not require any
analyticity assumptions, relies on three key ingredients: (1) a calculus of

settings. Reliable ML via prediction intervals (PIs) that take into account
jointly the epistemic and aleatory uncertainty is therefore imperative and is a
step towards increased trust in model forecasts. Conformal prediction (CP) is a
lightweight distribution-free uncertainty quantification framework that works
for any black-box model, yielding PIs that are valid under the mild assumption
of exchangeability. CP-type methods are gaining popularity due to being easy to
implement and computationally cheap; however, the exchangeability assumption
immediately excludes time series forecasting from the stage. Although recent
papers tackle distribution shift and asymptotic versions of CP, this is not
enough for the general time series forecasting problem of producing H-step
ahead valid PIs. To attain such a goal, we propose a new method called
AEnbMIMOCQR (Adaptive ensemble batch multi-input multi-output conformalized

appropriate for heteroscedastic time series. We compare the proposed method

I of this series, we used the population of nearly 2000 galaxy mergers
predicted by the TNG50-3 simulation to seed semi-analytic models of the orbital
evolution and coalescence of MBH pairs with initial separations of about 1 kpc.
Here, we calculate the dAGN luminosities and separation of these pairs as they
evolve in post-merger galaxies, and show how the coalescence fraction of dAGNs
changes with redshift. We find that because of the several Gyr long dynamical
friction timescale for orbital evolution, the fraction of dAGNs that eventually
end in a MBH merger grows with redshift and does not pass 50% until a redshift
of 1. However, dAGNs in galaxies with bulge masses >10^10 solar masses, or
comprised of near-equal mass MBHs, evolve more quickly and have higher than
average coalescence fractions. At any redshift, dAGNs observed with small
separations (> 0.7 kpc) have a higher probability of merging in a Hubble time
than more widely separated systems. As found in Paper I, radiation feedback
effects can significantly reduce the number of MBH mergers, and this could be
manifested as a larger than expected number of widely separated dAGNs. We
present a method to estimate the MBH coalescence rate as well as the potential
LISA detection rate given a survey of dAGNs. Comparing these rates to the
eventual LISA measurements will help determine the efficiency of dynamical

by integral transforms with Dirac delta function kernels, as in standard
immersed boundary (IB) methods. The major difference between our approach and
conventional IB methods is that we use peridynamics, instead of classical
continuum mechanics, to determine the structural forces. We focus on
non-ordinary state-based peridynamic material descriptions that allow us to use
a constitutive correspondence framework that can leverage well characterized
nonlinear constitutive models of soft materials. The convergence and accuracy
of our approach are compared to both conventional and immersed finite element

comparable accuracy with similar numbers of structural degrees of freedom for
several choices of the size of the peridynamic horizon. We also demonstrate

Niobium cavities near the transition temperature. Here we report our
theoretical analysis of these results based on the microscopic theory of
superconductivity that incorporates anisotropy of the superconducting gap and
inhomogeneous disorder in the screening region of the SRF cavities. We are able
to account for frequency shift anomalies very close to $T_c$ of the order of
fractions of a kHz. Our results for the frequency shift and Q are in good
agreement with the experimental data reported for all four N-doped Nb SRF

calculated theoretically has a peak of upper convexity with the largest $Q$ at
intermediate levels of disorder. For strong disorder, i.e. the dirty limit,
pair breaking in the presence of disorder and screening currents limits the
$Q$.

a VR headset) and real-world audio excerpts from TV. Under ideal listening
conditions, 28 normal-hearing participants listened to 30 audio excerpts
presented in random order and processed by conditions varying the relative

a recently proposed source separation system to attenuate the background given
the original mixture as the sole input. After listening to each excerpt,
subjects were asked to repeat the heard sentence and self-report the LE. Mean
pupil dilation and peak pupil dilation were analyzed and compared with the
self-report and the word recall rate. The multimodal evaluation shows a
consistent trend of decreasing LE along with decreasing background level. DE,
also when enabled by source separation, significantly reduces the pupil size as
well as the self-reported LE. This highlights the benefit of personalization

three engineering-grade TES bolometer wafers from the production cycle for
SPT-3G, the current receiver on the South Pole Telescope, to train and test

highly successful. While the ability of the random forest algorithm to predict

a model without trainable parameters which shows great potential for high

Bayesian frameworks are computationally intensive and prevent us from using
complete three-dimensional self-consistent models to retrieve exoplanetary

two-dimensional atmospheric models as a good compromise between computational
cost and model accuracy to better infer exoplanetary atmospheric
characteristics for the hottest planets. TauREx 2D uses a 2D parametrization
across the limb which computes the transmission spectrum from an exoplanetary
atmosphere assuming azimuthal symmetry. It also includes a thermal dissociation
model of various species. We demonstrate that, given an input observation,
TauREx 2D mitigates the biases between the retrieved atmospheric parameters and
the real atmospheric parameters. We also show that having a prior knowledge on
the link between local temperature and composition is instrumental in inferring
the temperature structure of the atmosphere. Finally, we apply such a model on

double assumption of fixed and evolving holographic length scale and assess
which one is better. Both types of DDEs (RVMs and HDEs) are confronted with the

We then design a statistical test for uncertain systems based on the

atomic level using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), a technique known as
atomic-precision-advanced-manufacturing (APAM), has allowed us to tailor
electronic devices with atomic precision, and thus has emerged as a way to
explore new possibilities in Si electronics. In these applications, critical
questions include where current flow is actually occurring in or near APAM
structures as well as whether leakage currents are present. In general,
detection and mapping of current flow in APAM structures are valuable
diagnostic tools to obtain reliable devices in digital-enhanced applications.
In this paper, we performed nitrogen-vacancy (NV) wide-field magnetic imaging
of stray magnetic fields from surface current densities flowing in an APAM test
device over a mm-field of view with {\mu}m-resolution. To do this, we
integrated a diamond having a surface NV ensemble with the device (patterned in
two parallel mm-sized ribbons), then mapped the magnetic field from the DC
current injected in the APAM device in a home-built NV wide-field microscope.
The 2D magnetic field maps were used to reconstruct the surface current
density, allowing us to obtain information on current paths, device failures
such as choke points where current flow is impeded, and current leakages
outside the APAM-defined P-doped regions. Analysis on the current density
reconstructed map showed a projected sensitivity of ~0.03 A/m, corresponding to
a smallest detectable current in the 200 {\mu}m-wide APAM ribbon of ~6 {\mu}A.
These results demonstrate the failure analysis capability of NV wide-field
magnetometry for APAM materials, opening the possibility to investigate other
cutting-edge microelectronic devices.

for the erasure of primordial density perturbations on small scales, which is
one of the main cosmological signatures of neutrino mass. In this paper, we
present a new code, FastDF, for generating 1%-accurate particle realisations of
the neutrino phase-space distribution using relativistic perturbation theory.
We use the geodesic equation to derive equations of motion for massive
particles moving in a weakly perturbed spacetime and integrate particles
accordingly. We demonstrate how to combine geodesic-based initial conditions
with the $\delta f$ method to minimise shot noise and clarify the definition of
the neutrino momentum, finding that large errors result if the wrong
parametrisation is used. Compared to standard Lagrangian methods with ad-hoc
thermal motions, FastDF achieves substantial improvements in accuracy. We
outline the approximation schemes used to speed up the code and to ensure
symplectic integration that preserves phase-space density. Finally, we discuss
implications for neutrino particles in cosmological N-body simulations. In
particular, we argue that particle methods can accurately describe the neutrino
distribution from $z=10^9$, when neutrinos are linear and ultra-relativistic,
down to $z=0$, when they are nonlinear and non-relativistic. FastDF can be used
to set up accurate initial conditions (ICs) for N-body simulations and has been

wings at the end of each back and forth motion to keep the wing's leading edge
ahead of its trailing edge. The wing rotation at the end of each half-stroke
pushes the leading edge vortex away from the wing which leads to a loss in the
lift. Unlike biological fliers, human-engineered flapping wing micro air
vehicles have different design limitations. They can be designed to avoid the
end of stroke wing rotation and use so-called water-treading flapping
kinematics. Flapping wings using conventional flapping kinematics have a
designated leading and trailing edge. In the water-treading mode, the role of
the leading and trailing edges are continuously alternated throughout the
stroke. Here, we compare velocity field and force measurements for a
rectangular flapping wing conducting normal hovering and water-treading
kinematics to study the difference in fluid dynamic performance between the two
types of flapping kinematics. We show that for similar power consumption, the
water-treading mode produces more lift than the conventional hovering mode and
is 50% more efficient for symmetric pitching kinematics. In the water-treading
mode, the leading edge vortex from the previous stroke is not pushed away but
is captured and keeps the newly formed leading edge vortex closer to the wing,
leading to a more rapid increase of the lift coefficient which is sustained for
longer. This makes the water-treading mode a promising alternative for
human-engineered flapping wing vehicles.

Yang-Mills and $\mathcal{N}=2$ circular quiver gauge theories with gauge groups
$U(N)$ or $SU(N)$. We calculate the exponentially dominant part of their
asymptotic expansions as the index parameter $q$ approaches any root of unity.
We find that some of the indices exhibit ``small"" ($\mathcal{O}(N^0)$ as $N
\rightarrow \infty$) exponential growth, which is much smaller than an
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ exponential growth of states that is indicative of a black
hole. This implies that the indices do not capture a growth of states that
would correspond to a supersymmetric black hole that preserves 4 supercharges
in the holographic dual AdS theory. Interestingly, the exponentially dominant
part in the Schur asymptotics we consider, depends on the parity of the rank
$N$.

adjustment without the requirement of paired or unpaired data during training.
Our method inherits the zero-reference learning and curve-based framework from
an effective low-light image enhancement method, Zero-DCE, with further speed
up in its inference speed, reduction in its model size, and extension to
controllable exposure adjustment. The improved inference speed and lightweight
model are achieved through novel curve distillation that approximates the
time-consuming iterative operation in the conventional curve-based framework by
high-order curve's tangent line. The controllable exposure adjustment is made
possible with a new self-supervised spatial exposure control loss that
constrains the exposure levels of different spatial regions of the output to be
close to the brightness distribution of an exposure map serving as an input
condition. Different from most existing methods that can only correct either
underexposed or overexposed photos, our approach corrects both underexposed and
overexposed photos with a single model. Notably, our approach can additionally
adjust the exposure levels of a photo globally or locally with the guidance of
an input condition exposure map, which can be pre-defined or manually set in
the inference stage. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method is
appealing for its fast, robust, and flexible performance, outperforming

two. Our models yield a hundred to several hundred detectable DWDs: indeed, the

suggest that the total number, periods, and chirp masses of LISA sources may
provide independent constraints on both LMC stellar mass and recent star

photo-ionisation, but also are the main source of decoherence. Therefore,
precise and quick determination of N$_s^0$ concentration is a key advantage to
a multitude of NV-related research in terms of material improvement as well as
applications. Here we present a method to determine the N$_s^0$ concentration
based on absorption spectroscopy in the UV-Visible range and fitting the 270 nm
absorption band. UV-Visible spectroscopy has experimental simplicity and
widespread availability that bear advantages over established methods. It
allows a rapid determination of N$_s^0$ densities, even for large numbers of
samples. Our method shows further advantages in determining low concentrations
as well as the ability to measure locally, which is highly relevant for
diamonds with largely varying N$_s^0$ concentrations in a single crystal. A
cross-check with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows high reliability
of our method and yields the absorption cross section of the 270~nm absorption
band, $\sigma=1.96\pm0.15$ cm$^{-1}\cdot$ppm$^{-1}$ (in common logarithm) or
$\sigma_e=4.51\pm0.35$ cm$^{-1}\cdot$ppm$^{-1}$ (in natural logarithm), which
serves as a reference to determine N$_s^0$ concentrations, and makes our method
applicable for others without the need for a known N$_s^0$-reference sample and

independent of the machine used and can be widely implemented as a standard

re-identification, gaze estimation, cinematography and image editing. We apply

a detailed investigation of final-state interactions (FSI) in the

operators to formulate an expansion scheme that satisfies the
non-energy-weighted cluster sum rule and successively includes higher-order
terms in the multiple-scattering series for the FSI. Computing the $E1$
strength up to third order in this scheme, we observe apparent convergence and
good agreement with experiment. The neutron-neutron FSI is by far the most
important contribution and largely determines the maximum value of the $E1$
distribution. However, inclusion of $nc$ FSI does shift the peak position to
slightly lower energies. Moreover, we investigate the sensitivity of the $E1$
response to the spin structure of the neutron-${}^9$Li interaction. We contrast
results for an interaction that is the same in the spin-1 and spin-2 channels
with one that is only operative in the spin-2 channel, and find that good
agreement with experimental data is only obtained if the interaction is present
in both spin channels. The latter case is shown to be equivalent to a

gravitational wave emission from e.g. non-axysmmetric fast-spinning neutron

of different waveforms, easily exceeding $\sim10^{17}$ templates. In such
cases, for practical reasons, only the top, say $\sim10^{10}$, results are
saved and followed-up through a hierarchy of stages. Most of these candidates
are not completely independent of neighbouring ones, but arise due to some
common cause: a fluctuation, a signal or a disturbance. By judiciously
clustering together candidates stemming from the same root cause, the
subsequent follow-ups become more effective. A number of clustering algorithms
have been employed in past searches based on iteratively finding symmetric and
compact over-densities around candidates with high detection statistic values.
The new clustering method presented in this paper is a significant improvement
over previous methods: it is agnostic about the shape of the over-densities, is
very efficient and it is effective: at a very high detection efficiency, it has
a noise rejection of $99.99\%$ , is capable of clustering two orders of
magnitude more candidates than attainable before and, at fixed sensitivity it
enables more than a factor of 30 faster follow-ups. We also demonstrate how to
optimally choose the clustering parameters.

users by automating the synthesis of diverse, realistic content based on a
collected dataset. However, the current machine learning approaches miss a key
element of the creative process -- the ability to synthesize things that go far
beyond the data distribution and everyday experience. To begin to address this
issue, we enable a user to ""warp"" a given model by editing just a handful of
original model outputs with desired geometric changes. Our method applies a
low-rank update to a single model layer to reconstruct edited examples.
Furthermore, to combat overfitting, we propose a latent space augmentation
method based on style-mixing. Our method allows a user to create a model that
synthesizes endless objects with defined geometric changes, enabling the
creation of a new generative model without the burden of curating a large-scale
dataset. We also demonstrate that edited models can be composed to achieve
aggregated effects, and we present an interactive interface to enable users to
create new models through composition. Empirical measurements on multiple test
cases suggest the advantage of our method against recent GAN fine-tuning
methods. Finally, we showcase several applications using the edited models,
including latent space interpolation and image editing.

merging BBHs within a small parameter space where mass transfer can lead to
enough orbital shrinkage to merge within a Hubble time. We find that only up to

relativistic gravity. In the coming decade, the number of observed tidal
disruption events (TDEs) will grow by several orders of magnitude, allowing
statistical inferences of the properties of the SMBH and stellar populations.
Here we analyse the probability distribution functions of the pericentre
distances of stars that encounter an SMBH in the Schwarzschild geometry, where
the results are completely analytic, and the Kerr metric. From this analysis we
calculate the number of observable TDEs, defined to be those that come within
the tidal radius $r_{\rm t}$ but outside the direct capture radius (which is,
in general, larger than the horizon radius). We find that relativistic effects
result in a steep decline in the number of stars that have pericenter distances
$r_{\rm p} \lesssim 10\,r_{\rm g}$, where $r_{\rm g} = GM/c^2$, and that for
maximally spinning SMBHs the distribution function of $r_{\rm p}$ at such
distances scales as $f_{\rm r_{\rm p}}\propto r_{\rm p}^{4/3}$, or in terms of
$\beta \equiv r_{\rm t}/r_{\rm p}$ scales as $f_{\beta} \propto \beta^{-10/3}$.
We find that spin has little effect on the TDE fraction until the very
high-mass end, where instead of being identically zero the rate is small
($\lesssim 1\%$ of the expected rate in the absence of relativistic effects).
Effectively independent of spin, if the progenitors of TDEs reflect the
predominantly low-mass stellar population and thus have masses $\lesssim
1M_{\odot}$, we expect a substantial reduction in the rate of TDEs above
$10^{7}M_{\odot}$.

redshift-matched analogs from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Our fiducial model,
which is parameterized by the satellite quenching timescale ($\tau_{\rm

the time of infall by using the observed coeval field quenched fraction and
after infall by tuning $\tau_{\rm quench}$ to reproduce the observed satellite
quenched fraction versus stellar mass trend. This model successfully reproduces
the observed satellite quenched fraction as a function of stellar mass (by
construction), projected cluster-centric radius, and redshift and is consistent
with the observed field and cluster stellar mass functions at $z \sim 1$. We
find that the satellite quenching timescale is mass dependent, in conflict with
some previous studies at low and intermediate redshift. Over the stellar mass
range probed ($M_{\star}> 10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), we find that the
satellite quenching timescale decreases with increasing satellite stellar mass
from $\sim1.6~{\rm Gyr}$ at $10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $\sim 0.6 - 1~{\rm
Gyr}$ at $10^{11}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and is roughly consistent with the total
cold gas (H{\scriptsize I}+H$_{2}$) depletion timescales at intermediate $z$,
suggesting that starvation may be the dominant driver of environmental
quenching at $z < 2$. Finally, while environmental mechanisms are relatively
efficient at quenching massive satellites, we find that the majority

emission whose progenitors are largely unknown. Although studying the FRB
population is essential for understanding how these astrophysical phenomena
occur, such studies have been difficult to conduct without large numbers of
FRBs and characterizable observational biases. Using the recently released
catalog of 536 FRBs published by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment/Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) collaboration, we present a study of
the FRB population that also calibrates for selection effects. Assuming a
Schechter luminosity function, we infer a characteristic energy cut-off of
$E_\mathrm{char} =$ $2.38^{+5.35}_{-1.64} \times 10^{41}$ erg and a
differential power-law index of $\gamma =$ $-1.3^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$.
Simultaneously, we infer a volumetric rate of
[$7.3^{+8.8}_{-3.8}$(stat.)$^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$(sys.)]$\times 10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$
year$^{-1}$ above a pivot energy of 10$^{39}$ erg and below a scattering
timescale of 10 ms at 600 MHz, and find we cannot significantly constrain the
cosmic evolution of the FRB population with star formation rate. Modeling the
host dispersion measure (DM) contribution as a log-normal distribution and
assuming a total Galactic contribution of 80 pc cm$^{-3}$, we find a median
value of $\mathrm{DM}_\mathrm{host} =$ $84^{+69}_{-49}$ pc cm$^{-3}$,
comparable with values typically used in the literature. Proposed models for
FRB progenitors should be consistent with the energetics and abundances of the
full FRB population predicted by our results. Finally, we infer the redshift
distribution of FRBs detected with CHIME, which will be tested with the
localizations and redshifts enabled by the upcoming CHIME/FRB Outriggers

examine the dynamical instability of the fluid sphere in ($N$+1) dimensions by
exploiting Chandrasekhar's criterion to each quasistatic equilibrium along the
sequence of the evolution. Once the instability is triggered, it would probably
collapse into a black hole if no other interaction halts the process. From this
viewpoint, the privilege of (3+1)-dimensional spacetime is manifest, as it is
the marginal dimensionality in which the ideal monatomic fluid is stable but
not too stable. Moreover, it is the unique dimensionality that allows stable
hydrostatic equilibrium with positive cosmological constant. While all higher
dimensional ($N>3$) spheres are genuinely unstable. In contrast, in
(2+1)-dimensional spacetime it is too stable either in the context of Newton's
theory of gravity or Einstein's general relativity. It is well known that the
role of negative cosmological constant is crucial to have the
Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole solution and the equilibrium
configurations of a fluid disk. Owing to the negativeness of the cosmological
constant, there is no unstable configuration for a homogeneous fluid disk to
collapse into a naked singularity, which supports the cosmic censorship
conjecture. However, BTZ holes of mass $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BTZ}>0$ could emerge
from collapsing fluid disks. The implications of spacetime dimensionality are
briefly discussed.

other phenomena. In this paper we present our newly-developed array
arrangement, which mounts all telescopes into the inside of a hemispherical
bowl (turning the original dome design inside-out). The telescopes' beams thus
converge at a single ``pseudofocal'' point. When placed along the telescope's
polar axis, this point does not move as the telescope tracks, allowing every
telescope to simultaneously look through a single, unmoving window in a fixed
enclosure. This telescope bowl is suspended from a simple free-swinging pivot
(turning the usual telescope mounting support upside-down), with polar
alignment afforded by the creation of a virtual polar axis defined by a second
mounting pivot. This new design, currently being prototyped with the
38-telescope Argus Pathfinder, eliminates the need for a movable external dome
and thus greatly reduces the cost and complexity of the full Argus Array.
Coupled with careful software scope control and the use of existing software
pipelines, the Argus Array could thus become one of the deepest and fastest sky

molecular flows and radio jet powers are compared to molecular outflows in 45
active galaxies within $z<0.2$. We seek to understand the relative efficacy of
radio, quasar, and starburst feedback over a range of active galaxy types.
Molecular flows powered by radio feedback in BCGs are $\sim$10--1000 times
larger in extent compared to contemporary galaxies hosting quasar nuclei and
starbursts. Radio feedback yields lower flow velocities but higher momenta
compared to quasar nuclei, as the molecular gas flows in BCGs are usually
$\sim$10--100 times more massive. The product of the molecular gas mass and
lifting altitude divided by the AGN or starburst power -- a parameter referred
to as the lifting factor -- exceeds starbursts and quasar nuclei by two to
three orders of magnitude, respectively. When active, radio feedback is
generally more effective at lifting gas in galaxies compared to quasars and
starburst winds. The kinetic energy flux of molecular clouds generally lies
below and often substantially below a few percent of the driving power. We find
tentatively that star formation is suppressed in BCGs relative to other active
galaxies, perhaps because these systems rarely form molecular disks that are
more impervious to feedback and are better able to promote star formation.

neutral high-redshift intergalactic medium makes it unlikely to directly detect
these photons during the Epoch of Reionization. Indirect methods of studying

Combining our observations with photoionization models, we find that the
regions with the largest relative \ion{Mg}{II} emission and \ion{Mg}{II} escape
fractions have the highest ionization and lowest dust attenuation. Some regions
have an escape fraction that matches that required by models to reionize the
early universe, while other regions do not. We observe a factor of 36 spatial
variation in the inferred LyC escape fraction, which is similar to recently
observed statistical samples of indirect tracers of ionizing photon escape

properties lead to large variations in the measured LyC escape fractions. Our
results suggest that single sightline observations may not trace the

we can in principle use differential equations to describe their motion as a
set of functions that maps time to position (and velocity, acceleration, and so
on). With inanimate objects, we can reliably predict their trajectories by
using differential equations that account for up to the second-order time
derivative of their position, as is commonly done in analytical mechanics. With
animate objects, though, and with humans, in particular, we do not know the
cardinality of the set of equations that define their trajectory. We may be
tempted to think, for example, that by reason of their complexity in cognition
or behaviour as compared to, say, a rock, then the motion of humans requires a
more complex description than the one generally used to describe the motion of
physical systems. In this paper, we examine a real-world dataset on human
mobility and consider the information that is added by each (computed, but
denoised) additional time derivative, and find the maximum order of derivatives
of the position that, for that particular dataset, cannot be expressed as a
linear transformation of the previous. In this manner, we identify the
dimensionality of a minimal model that correctly describes the observed
trajectories. We find that every higher-order derivative after the acceleration
is linearly dependent upon one of the previous time-derivatives. This measure
is robust against noise and the choice for differentiation techniques that we
use to compute the time-derivatives numerically as a function of the measured
position. This result imposes empirical constraints on the possible sets of
differential equations that can be used to describe the kinematics of a moving
human.

collaborative filtering (CF) with the modeling of user-item interaction graphs.
The key idea of existing GNN-based recommender systems is to recursively
perform the message passing along the user-item interaction edge for refining
the encoded embeddings. Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the
current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training
data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user
preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is
often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal
representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT,
a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments
user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an
explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to
maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph
transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative
self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the
user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender
systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve
the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation
studies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation
framework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues. The source code

this analysis demands a modified dimensional analysis that changes the

finite critical value above which the fractonic phase melts, proliferating

formation. The gravitational waves from a coalescing binary contain information
about its orbital eccentricity, which may be measured if the binary retains
sufficient eccentricity near merger. Dedicated waveforms are required to
measure eccentricity. Several models have been put forward, and show good
agreement with numerical relativity at the level of a few percent or better.
However, there are multiple ways to define eccentricity for inspiralling
systems, and different models internally use different definitions of
eccentricity, making it difficult to directly compare eccentricity
measurements. In this work, we systematically compare two eccentric waveform
models, $\texttt{SEOBNRE}$ and $\texttt{TEOBResumS}$, by developing a framework
to translate between different definitions of eccentricity. This mapping is
constructed by minimizing the relative mismatch between the two models over
eccentricity and reference frequency, before evolving the eccentricity of one
model to the same reference frequency as the other model. We show that for a
given value of eccentricity passed to $\texttt{SEOBNRE}$, one must input a
$20$-$50\%$ smaller value of eccentricity to $\texttt{TEOBResumS}$ in order to
obtain a waveform with the same empirical eccentricity. We verify this mapping
by repeating our analysis for eccentric numerical relativity simulations,
demonstrating that $\texttt{TEOBResumS}$ reports a correspondingly smaller
value of eccentricity than $\texttt{SEOBNRE}$.

include three classes for direct instance segmentation. Detailed experiments
were performed regarding training schemes, training settings, network
backbones, and individual modules on the segmentation performance. Our proposed
training scheme draws minibatches in turn from each dataset, and the gradients
are accumulated before an optimization step. We found that the key to training
a universal network is all-time supervision on all datasets, and it is
necessary to sample each dataset in an unbiased way. Our experiments also
suggest that there might exist common features to define cell boundaries across
cell types and imaging modalities, which could allow application of trained
models to totally unseen datasets. A few training tricks can further boost the
segmentation performance, including uneven class weights in the cross-entropy
loss function, well-designed learning rate scheduler, larger image crops for
contextual information, and additional loss terms for unbalanced classes. We
also found that segmentation performance can benefit from group normalization
layer and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, thanks to their more reliable
statistics estimation and improved semantic understanding, respectively. We

In this paper
we address two fundamental questions: the existence of oscillatory motions and
of chaotic hyperbolic sets.
  In 1922, Chazy classified the possible final motions of the three bodies,
that is the behaviors the bodies may have when time tends to infinity. One of
the possible behaviors are oscillatory motions, that is, solutions of the 3
Body Problem such that the positions of the bodies $q_0, q_1, q_2$ satisfy \[
\liminf_{t\to\pm\infty}\sup_{i,j=0,1,2, i\neq j}\|q_i-q_j\|<+\infty \quad
\text{ and }\quad \limsup_{t\to\pm\infty}\sup_{i,j=0,1,2, i\neq
j}\|q_i-q_j\|=+\infty. \] Assume that all three masses $m_0,m_1,m_2>0$ are not
equal. Then, we prove that such motions exists. We also prove that one can
construct solutions of the three body problem whose forward and backward final
motions are of different type.
  This result relies on constructing invariant sets whose dynamics is
conjugated to the (infinite symbols) Bernouilli shift. These sets are
hyperbolic for the symplectically reduced planar 3 Body Problem. As a
consequence, we obtain the existence of chaotic motions, an infinite number of
periodic orbits and positive topological entropy for the 3 Body Problem.

  Geometry Using Deep Learning and Compact Representations","11 pages, 14 figures",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the growing field of virtual auditory display, personalized head-related
transfer functions (HRTFs) play a vital role in establishing an accurate sound
image. In this work, we propose an HRTF personalization method employing
convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict a subject's HRTFs for all
directions from their scanned head geometry. To ease the training of the CNN
models, we propose novel pre-processing methods for both the head scans and
HRTF data to achieve compact representations. For the head scan, we use
truncated spherical cap harmonic (SCH) coefficients to represent the pinna
area, which is important in the acoustic scattering process. For the HRTF data,
we use truncated spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients to represent the HRTF
magnitudes and onsets. One CNN model is trained to predict the SH coefficients
of the HRTF magnitudes from the SCH coefficients of the scanned ear geometry
and other anthropometric measurements of the head. The other CNN model is
trained to predict SH coefficients of the HRTF onsets from only the
anthropometric measurements of the ear, head, and torso. Combining the
magnitude and onset predictions, our method is able to predict the complete and
global HRTF data. A leave-one-out validation with the log-spectral distortion
(LSD) metric is used for objective evaluation. The results show a decent LSD
level at both spatial \& temporal dimensions compared to the ground-truth HRTFs
and a lower LSD than the boundary element method (BEM) simulation of HRTFs that
the database provides. The localization simulation results with an auditory
model are also consistent with the objective evaluation metrics, showing the
localization responses with our predicted HRTFs are significantly better than
with the BEM calculated ones.

an important topic in condensed-matter physics, and potential similarities to
and differences from cuprates are under intense debate. We determine general
features of the charge excitation spectrum in nickelates from two opposite
viewpoints: (i) Nickelates are regarded as strongly correlated electron systems
like cuprate superconductors and thus can be described by the $t$-$J$ model,
and (ii) electron correlation effects are not as strong as in cuprates, and
thus, random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations may capture the essential
physics. We find that in both cases, plasmon excitations are realized around
the momentum transfer $\vq=(0,0,q_z)$, although they tend to be damped more
strongly in the RPA. In particular, this damping is enhanced by the relatively
large interlayer hopping expected in nickelates. Besides reproducing the
optical plasmon at $\vq=(0,0,0)$ observed in Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$, we
obtain low-energy plasmons with gaps of $\sim 360$ and $\sim 560$ meV at
$\vq=(0,0,q_z)$ for finite $q_z$ in cases (i) and (ii), respectively. The
present work offers a possible theoretical hint to answer whether nickelates

the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials
undergo, presenting manganese oxides as examples. Such changes may occur during
preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during
application of potentials without or with catalytic reactions. We conclude with
a concise summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate the

GAFs, determinantal point processes and permanental-determinantal point
processes are obtained. Then, the Schramm--Loewner evolution with parameter
$\kappa >0$, SLE$_{\kappa}$, is introduced, which is driven by a BM on
${\mathbb{R}}$ and generates a family of conformally invariant probability laws
of random curves on the upper half complex plane ${\mathbb{H}}$. We regard
SLE$_{\kappa}$ as a complexification of BES$_D$ with the relation
$\kappa=4/(D-1)$. The last topic of lectures is the construction of the
multiple SLE$_{\kappa}$, which is driven by the $N$-particle process on
${\mathbb{R}}$ and generates $N$ interacting random curves in ${\mathbb{H}}$.
We prove that the multiple SLE/GFF coupling is established, if and only if the
driving $N$-particle process on ${\mathbb{R}}$ is identified with DYS$_{\beta}$
with the relation $\beta=8/\kappa$.

program, the goal of regression verification is to mark pairs of functions from
$p_1$ and $p_2$ that are equivalent, given a definition of equivalence. The
most common definition is that of partial equivalence, namely that the two
functions emit the same output if they are fed with the same input and they
both terminate. The strategy used by the Regression Verification Tool (RVT) is
to progress bottom up on the call graphs of $P_1,P_2$, abstract those functions
that were already proven to be equivalent with uninterpreted functions, turn
loops into recursion, and abstract the recursive calls also with uninterpreted
functions. This enables it to create verification conditions in the form of
small programs that are loop- and recursion-free. This method works well for
recursive functions as long as they are in sync, and typically fails otherwise.
In this work we study the problem of proving equivalence when the two recursive
functions are not in sync. Effectively we extend previous work that studied
this problem for functions with a single recursive call site, to the general
case. We also introduce a method for detecting automatically the unrolling that
is necessary for making two recursive functions synchronize, when possible. We
show examples of pairs of functions with multiple recursive calls that can now
be proven equivalent with our method, but cannot be proven equivalent with any
other automated verification system.

flux content increases resulting in an increase in upstream magnetic field,
upstream velocity field and unnormalized reconnection rate while keeping the
normalized rate, downstream magnetic field and current sheet length independent
of it. Interestingly, the reconnection rate is found to be different from the
upstream and downstream velocity as well as inverse aspect ratio of the current
sheet, as opposed to the findings of the Sweet-Parker model. Secondly, the
in-plane shear flow effects are studied, keeping the island width and system
size fixed. Here thickness and length of the current sheet, the upstream
magnetic and velocity field components, reconnection rate and time, current
sheet inclination angle with shear flow length scale and amplitude are
calculated. Interestingly, the inclination angle of the current sheet and the
diffusion region are found to be different. These differences are more in
stronger shear flows. These results are significantly different from the Harris
sheet setup with shear flow. The results have potential application in the

and studied by following a general idea to leverage the abundant interaction
records of warm users to infer the preference of cold users. However, the
performance of these solutions is limited by the amount of records available
from warm users to use. Thus, building a recommendation system based on few
interaction records from a few users still remains a challenging problem for
unpopular or early-stage recommendation platforms. This paper focuses on
solving the few-shot recommendation problem for news recommendation based on
two observations. First, news at different platforms (even in different
languages) may share similar topics. Second, the user preference over these
topics is transferable across different platforms. Therefore, we propose to
solve the few-shot news recommendation problem by transferring the user-news
preference from a rich source domain to a low-resource target domain. To bridge
two domains in different languages without any overlapping users and news, we
propose a novel unsupervised cross-lingual transfer model as the news encoder
that aligns semantically similar news in two domains. A user encoder is
constructed on top of the aligned news encoding and transfers the user
preference from the source to the target domain. Experimental results on two
real-world news recommendation datasets show the superior performance of our
proposed method on addressing few-shot news recommendation, comparing to the
state-of-the-art baselines.

quantify the model-form uncertainty in Reynolds-averaged Naiver-Stokes (RANS)
simulations of laminar-turbulent transitional flows over an Selig-Donovan (SD)

the momentum equations; perturbations are injected into the amplitude,
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the anisotropy Reynolds stress tensor undergone
an eigen-decomposition. In this study, our analyses focus upon the amplitude
perturbation. We observed a monotonic behavior of the magnitude of the

regressions based on the turbulence kinetic energy discrepancies are used to
develop a novel switch marker function Mk to introduce perturbations in a

Mk and eigenvalue perturbations show a synergy behavior, e.g., dramatically
increased uncertainty bounds to account for the discrepancy in the RANS
prediction; and the Mk function effectively avoids over-perturbation to the

It has previously been observed that if $\chi$ has large order $d \geq

with Vinogradov's conjecture on quadratic non-residues. We give a new and
simple proof of this fact. We show, furthermore, that if $d$ is squarefree then
for any $d$th root of unity $\alpha$ the number of $n \leq x$ such that
$\chi(n) = \alpha$ is $o_{d \rightarrow \infty}(x)$ whenever $x > q^\delta$.
Consequently, when $\chi$ has sufficiently large order the values
$\{\chi(n)\}_{n \leq q^\delta}$ cannot cluster near $1$ for any $\delta > 0$.
  Our proof relies on a non-trivial second moment estimate for short sums of
the characters $\chi^\ell$ on average over $1 \leq \ell \leq d-1$, provided
that $d$ has no small prime factors, which may be of independent interest. In
particular, given any $\delta > 0$ we show that for all but $o(d)$ powers $1

intervals $n \leq q^\delta$ as long as $d \geq d_0(\delta)$, going beyond
Burgess' theorem. Our argument blends together results from pretentious number
theory and additive combinatorics.
  Finally, we show that, uniformly over prime $3 \leq d \leq q-1$, the
P\'{o}lya-Vinogradov inequality may be improved for $\chi^\ell$ on average over

capable they may transform the way we interact with machines and how they
interact with each other. Increasingly, LLMs are being coupled with
sensorimotor devices. LLMs can talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? A
road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined with seven major
improvements inspired by brain systems. LLMs could be used to uncover new

simple model we translate observed profile variations into optical depth
variations and, consequently, variations in measured mass loss rates. Although
global rates may be stable, measured rates vary. Consequently, profile
variations infer how mass loss rates determined from UV wind lines vary. These
variations quantify the intrinsic error inherent in any mass loss rate derived
from a single observation. These derived rates can differ by factors of 3 or
more. Our results also imply that rates from non-simultaneous observations

high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems that are sensitive along
coordinates with low-variance because such coordinates are often truncated,
e.g., by proper orthogonal decomposition, kernel principal component analysis,
and autoencoders. Such systems are encountered frequently in shear-dominated
fluid flows where non-normality plays a significant role in the growth of
disturbances. In order to address these issues, we employ ideas from active
subspaces to find low-dimensional systems of coordinates for model reduction
that balance adjoint-based information about the system's sensitivity with the
variance of states along trajectories. The resulting method, which we refer to
as covariance balancing reduction using adjoint snapshots (CoBRAS), is
analogous to balanced truncation with state and adjoint-based gradient
covariance matrices replacing the system Gramians and obeying the same key
transformation laws. Here, the extracted coordinates are associated with an
oblique projection that can be used to construct Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order
models. We provide an efficient snapshot-based computational method analogous
to balanced proper orthogonal decomposition. This also leads to the observation
that the reduced coordinates can be computed relying on inner products of state
and gradient samples alone, allowing us to find rich nonlinear coordinates by
replacing the inner product with a kernel function. In these coordinates,
reduced-order models can be learned using regression. We demonstrate these
techniques and compare to a variety of other methods on a simple, yet
challenging three-dimensional system and a nonlinear axisymmetric jet flow
simulation with $10^5$ state variables.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct the CBD from tomographic image data
obtained by synchrotron tomography. In the present paper, we consider several
approaches to segment 3D image data of two different cathodes into three
phases, namely active material, CBD and pores. More precisely, we focus on
global thresholding, a local closing approach based on EDX data, a k-means

tomography and FIB-SEM data representing the same electrode. We quantify the
impact of the considered segmentation approaches on morphological
characteristics as well as on the resulting performance by spatially-resolved
transport simulations. Furthermore, we use experimentally determined
electrochemical properties to identify an appropriate range for the effective
transport parameter of the CBD. The developed methodology is applied to two
differently manufactured cathodes, namely an ultra-thick unstructured cathode
and a two-layer cathode with varying CBD content in both layers. This
comparison elucidates the impact of a specific structuring concept on the 3D

approaches with reduced overlap between scanning areas result in
reconstructions with artifacts. In this paper, we propose complementing
sparsely acquired or undersampled data with data sampled from a deep generative

differential equation consistent with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. First, we
develop a connection between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian scenarios by a
reparameterization in the complex plane, followed by a restriction of the
$\mathcal{PT}$-deformation parameter. The latter is responsible for preserving
the information about $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry when we choose to work in the
Hermitian scenario. We note that this factor is present in all non-perturbative
results and in the transseries representation of the deformed Mathieu partition
function that we have obtained. In quantum mechanics, we found that the
deformation parameter of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry has an effect on the real
instanton solution for the Mathieu deformed potential in the Hermitian
scenario. As its value increases, the non-Hermiticity factor makes it smoother
for the instanton to pass from one minimum to another, that is, it modifies the
instanton width. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the height of
the potential barrier decreases as we increase the value of the deformation
parameter. Its effect extends to the multi-instanton level and to the bounce
limit of an instanton-anti-instanton pair whose equation of motion compares to
the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model.

paper is a Deep Learning methodology for imbalanced, multilabel chest X-ray

broad zero-phonon lines at elevated temperatures has been put in question by
recent observations of Fourier transform (FT) limited photons emitted from h-BN

produce photons that are directed in-plane, suggesting that the dipoles are
oriented perpendicular to the h-BN plane. Motivated by the promise of an

that Lorentz violation can also activate multiple polarizations of GWs. We use
the gauge invariants to investigate the polarizations of GWs in the bumblebee
gravity model, and obtain the following results. (i) For a vector background
$b^\mu$ with only a nonzero temporal component $b^t$, there are five
independent propagating degrees of freedom (DOFs), which is simlar to the
Einstein-aether theory. (ii) The presence of a spatial component in the
background defines a preferred spatial direction which breaks rotational
symmetry. We denote $\hat{\bf b}$ as the direction of the spatial part of the
background and $b_s$ as its length. If GWs propagate along $\hat{\bf b}$, the
polarization content is similar to the purely timelike case. (iii) If the
propagation direction of GWs is separated by an angle $\beta$ to $\hat{\bf b}$,
and $\beta=\arccos(b^t/b_s)$, there are only two tensor polarizations. (iv) If
$\beta\neq \arccos(b^t/b_s)$, there are only two independent DOFs, and the
vector and scalar modes degenerate with the tensor modes. The tensor
perturbations can activate a mixture of all six polarizations simultaneously.
Finally, we point out the difference in GWs between the bumblebee gravity model
and the minimal Standard-Model Extension framework in the linearized regime.
Current observations have placed stringent constraints on the anisotropy
induced by the background, while our theoretical study still reveals some novel
phenomena and provides more understanding about the interaction between the

past aortic stenosis (AS) are studied using GPU-accelerated patient-specific
computational fluid dynamics. Three cases of moderate AS, one with a dilated
ascending aorta and two within the normal range (root diameter less than 4cm)
are simulated for physiological beat cycle waveforms obtained from
echocardiography data. The computational framework is built based on
sharp-interface Immersed Boundary Method, where aortic geometries segmented
from CT angiograms are integrated into a high-order incompressible
Navier-Stokes solver. We show that even though the wall shear stress is
elevated and oscillatory due to turbulence in the ascending aorta for all the
cases, its spatial distribution is significantly more focused for the case with
dilation than those without dilation. This focal area is linked to aortic valve
jet impingement on the outer curvature of the ascending aorta, and has been
shown in vivo using 4D flow MRI of aortic stenosis patients with aortic
dilation (van Ooij et al., J. Am. Heart Assoc., 6(9), 2017). We show that this
focal area also accommodates a persistent pocket of high pressure, which is
likely to have contributed to the dilation process through an increased
wall-normal forcing. The cases without dilation, on the contrary, showed a
rather oscillatory pressure behaviour, with no persistent pressure buildup
effect. We further argue that a more proximal branching of the aortic arch
could explain the lack of a focal area of elevated wall shear stress and
pressure, because it interferes with the impingement process due to fluid
suction effects. These phenomena are further illustrated using an idealized
aortic geometry. We finally show that a restored inflow condition eliminates
the focal area of elevated wall shear stress and pressure zone from the
ascending aorta.

a new idempotent constraint for reconstruction coefficient matrices. And by
combining the doubly stochastic constraints, the coefficient matrices which are
closed to normalized membership matrices could be directly achieved. We present

(2017) on quantum tomography with accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, when
the measurements choices are independent of previously observed outcomes (i.e.,
they are nonadaptive). We give a succinct proof of this result. This leads to
stronger lower bounds when the learner uses measurements with a constant number
of outcomes. In particular, this rigorously establishes the optimality of the
folklore ``Pauli tomography"" algorithm in terms of its sample complexity. We
also derive novel bounds of $\Omega(r^2 d/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(r^2
d^2/\epsilon^2)$ for learning rank $r$ states using arbitrary and
constant-outcome measurements, respectively, in the nonadaptive case.
  In addition to the sample complexity, a resource of practical significance
for learning quantum states is the number of different measurements used by an
algorithm. We extend our lower bounds to the case where the learner performs
possibly adaptive measurements from a fixed set of $\exp(O(d))$ measurements.
This implies in particular that adaptivity does not give us any advantage using
single-copy measurements that are efficiently implementable. We also obtain a
similar bound in the case where the goal is to predict the expectation values
of a given sequence of observables, a task known as shadow tomography. Finally,
in the case of adaptive, single-copy measurements implementable with
polynomial-size circuits, we prove that a straightforward strategy based on

multivariate response regression problem with both unobserved and heterogeneous
confounding variables of the form $Y=A^T X+ B^T Z+ \sum_{j=1}^{p} C^T_j X_j Z +

non-Euclidean (hyperbolic) mean, where the optimization solutions including the
Euclidean gradients, non-Euclidean gradients, and Stein gradient are presented

effective parameter update policies for learning on small data. Then, we

practice among software developers. By communicating important aspects of the

maintenance. However, when the code is modified without an accompanying
correction to the comment, an inconsistency between the comment and code can
arise, which opens up the possibility for developer confusion and bugs. In this
paper, we propose two models based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and Longformer
(Beltagy et al., 2020) to detect such inconsistencies in a natural language
inference (NLI) context. Through an evaluation on a previously established
corpus of comment-method pairs both during and after code changes, we
demonstrate that our models outperform multiple baselines and yield comparable
results to the state-of-the-art models that exclude linguistic and lexical
features. We further discuss ideas for future research in using pretrained
language models for both inconsistency detection and automatic comment
updating.

pansharpening. Most of the available deep learning-based pan-sharpening methods
sharpen the multispectral images through a one-step scheme, which strongly
depends on the reconstruction ability of the network. However, remote sensing
images always have large variations, as a result, these one-step methods are
vulnerable to the error accumulation and thus incapable of preserving spatial
details as well as the spectral information. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-step model for pan-sharpening that sharpens the MS image through the
progressive compensation of the spatial and spectral information. Firstly, a
deep multiscale guided generative adversarial network is used to preliminarily
enhance the spatial resolution of the MS image. Starting from the pre-sharpened
MS image in the coarse domain, our approach then progressively refines the
spatial and spectral residuals over a couple of generative adversarial networks
(GANs) that have reverse architectures. The whole model is composed of triple
GANs, and based on the specific architecture, a joint compensation loss
function is designed to enable the triple GANs to be trained simultaneously.
Moreover, the spatial-spectral residual compensation structure proposed in this
paper can be extended to other pan-sharpening methods to further enhance their
fusion results. Extensive experiments are performed on different datasets and
the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
method.

(SS-SIM) scheme, which is integrated to orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) framework to enhance the diversity over the conventional IM
schemes. Particularly, the resulting scheme, called SS-SIMOFDM, jointly employs
both spread spectrum and sub-carrier index modulations to form a precoding
vector which is then used to spread an M-ary complex symbol across all active
sub-carriers. As a result, the proposed scheme enables a novel transmission of
three signal domains: SS and sub-carrier indices, and a single M-ary symbol.
For practical implementations, two reduced-complexity near-optimal detectors
are proposed, which have complexities less depending on the M-ary modulation
size. Then, the bit error probability and its upper bound are analyzed to gain
an insight into the diversity gain, which is shown to be strongly affected by
the order of sub-carrier indices. Based on this observation, we propose two
novel sub-carrier index mapping methods, which significantly increase the
diversity gain of SSSIM-OFDM. Finally, simulation results show that our scheme
achieves better error performance than the benchmarks at the cost of lower
spectral efficiency compared to classical OFDM and OFDM-IM, which can carry
multiple M-ary symbols.

Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g.,
SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural
fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by
only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since
they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand,
distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have
limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural
Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally
constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field
formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke,
which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field.
Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable
both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore,
the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point
clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance
while providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis. The code is

distributed computing. There is a canonical family of distributed graph
coloring algorithms known as the locally-iterative coloring algorithms, first
formalized in the seminal work of [Szegedy and Vishwanathan, STOC'93]. In such
algorithms, every vertex iteratively updates its own color according to a
predetermined function of the current coloring of its local neighborhood. Due
to the simplicity and naturalness of its framework, locally-iterative coloring
algorithms are of great significance both in theory and practice. In this
paper, we give a locally-iterative $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm with
$O(\Delta^{3/4}\log\Delta)+\log^*n$ running time. This is the first
locally-iterative $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm with sublinear-in-$\Delta$
running time, and answers the main open question raised in a recent
breakthrough [Barenboim, Elkin, and Goldberg, JACM'21]. A key component of our
algorithm is a locally-iterative procedure that transforms an
$O(\Delta^2)$-coloring to a $(\Delta+O(\Delta^{3/4}\log\Delta))$-coloring in
$o(\Delta)$ time. Inside this procedure we work on special proper colorings
that encode (arb)defective colorings, and reduce the number of used colors
quadratically in a locally-iterative fashion. As a main application of our
result, we also give a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm for
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring with $O(\Delta^{3/4}\log\Delta)+\log^*n$ stabilization
time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-stabilizing

retrieve visually similar objects. However, existing top-performing works
usually impose pairwise similarities on the semantic embedding spaces or design
a localization sub-network to continually fine-tune the entire model in limited
data scenarios, thus resulting in convergence to suboptimal solutions. In this
paper, we develop Fine-grained Retrieval Prompt Tuning (FRPT), which steers a
frozen pre-trained model to perform the fine-grained retrieval task from the
perspectives of sample prompting and feature adaptation. Specifically, FRPT
only needs to learn fewer parameters in the prompt and adaptation instead of
fine-tuning the entire model, thus solving the issue of convergence to
suboptimal solutions caused by fine-tuning the entire model. Technically, a
discriminative perturbation prompt (DPP) is introduced and deemed as a sample
prompting process, which amplifies and even exaggerates some discriminative
elements contributing to category prediction via a content-aware inhomogeneous
sampling operation. In this way, DPP can make the fine-grained retrieval task
aided by the perturbation prompts close to the solved task during the original
pre-training. Thereby, it preserves the generalization and discrimination of
representation extracted from input samples. Besides, a category-specific
awareness head is proposed and regarded as feature adaptation, which removes
the species discrepancies in features extracted by the pre-trained model using
category-guided instance normalization. And thus, it makes the optimized
features only include the discrepancies among subcategories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our FRPT with fewer learnable parameters achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used fine-grained datasets.

wireless systems. In downlink transmissions, the data symbols are broadcast
from a base station to different users, which are superimposed with different
power to facilitate high-integrity detection using successive interference
cancellation (SIC). However, SIC requires accurate knowledge of both the
channel model and channel state information (CSI), which may be difficult to
acquire. We propose a deep learningaided SIC detector termed SICNet, which
replaces the interference cancellation blocks of SIC by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Explicitly, SICNet jointly trains its internal DNN-aided blocks for
inferring the soft information representing the interfering symbols in a
data-driven fashion, rather than using hard-decision decoders as in classical
SIC. As a result, SICNet reliably detects the superimposed symbols in the
downlink of non-orthogonal systems without requiring any prior knowledge of the
channel model, while being less sensitive to CSI uncertainty than its
model-based counterpart. SICNet is also robust to changes in the number of
users and to their power allocation. Furthermore, SICNet learns to produce
accurate soft outputs, which facilitates improved soft-input error correction
decoding compared to model-based SIC. Finally, we propose an online training
method for SICNet under block fading, which exploits the channel decoding for
accurately recovering online data labels for retraining, hence, allowing it to
smoothly track the fading envelope without requiring dedicated pilots. Our
numerical results show that SICNet approaches the performance of classical SIC
under perfect CSI, while outperforming it under realistic CSI uncertainty.

distribution on subsets of its edges. The $\mathcal{D}$-adaptive random graph
process (or $\mathcal{D}$-process) is a single player game in which the player
is initially presented the empty graph on $[n]$. In each step, a subset of
edges of $K_n$, say $X$, is independently sampled from $\mathcal{D}$ and
presented to the player. The player then adaptively selects precisely one edge
$e$ from $X$, and adds $e$ to its current graph. For a fixed (edge) monotone
graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy
the property in as few steps as possible. Through appropriate choices of
$\mathcal{D}$, the $\mathcal{D}$-process generalizes well-studied adaptive
processes, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process.
  We prove a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a
sharp threshold for the property $\mathcal{P}$ in the $\mathcal{D}$-process. We
apply our theorem to the semi-random graph process and prove the existence of a
sharp threshold when $\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to being Hamiltonian or to
containing a perfect matching. These are the first results for the semi-random
graph process which show the existence of a sharp threshold when $\mathcal{P}$
corresponds to containing a \textit{sparse} spanning graph. Using a separate
analytic argument, we show that each sharp threshold is of the form
$C_{\mathcal{P}}n$ for some fixed constant $C_{\mathcal{P}}>0$. This answers
two of the open problems proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al. (SODA 2020) in the
affirmative. Unlike similar results which establish sharp thresholds for
certain distributions and properties, we establish the existence of sharp
thresholds without explicitly identifying asymptotically optimal strategies.

have either dynamical equations or jump conditions (the conservation equations
without any time evolution). The solution of the jump condition in curve
space-time is derived and analyzed in detail in the present work. We also
derive the Taub adiabat or combustion adiabat equation from the jump condition.
We have analyzed both time-like and space-like shocks in the present work. We
find that the change in entropy for the weak shocks for curved space-time is
small similar to that for flat space-time. We also find that for general
relativistic space-like shocks, the Chapman-Jouguet point does not necessarily
correspond to the sonic point for downstream matter, unlike the relativistic
case. To analyze the shock wave solution for the curved space-time, one needs
the information of metric potentials describing the space-time, which for the
present work is taken to be a neutron star. We assume that a shock wave is
generated at the centre of the star and is propagating outward. As the shock
wave is propagating outwards, it combusts nuclear matter to quark matter, and
we have a combustion scenario. We find that the general relativistic treatment
of shock conditions is necessary to study shocks in neutron stars so that the
results are consistent with the solution of the TOV equation while calculating
the maximum mass for a given equation of state. We also find that with such
general relativistic treatment, the combustion process in neutron stars is
always a detonation.

is because, although the human visual system can detect symmetries in 2D images
effectively, regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, overlooking
further inherent symmetries existing in medical images such as rotations and
reflections. To solve this problem, we propose a novel group equivariant
segmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more
precise representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised
on each orientation, which allows it to effectively address the gaps of
learning symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks
globally equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layer-wise
symmetry constraints. Finally, based on our novel framework, extensive

  Learning with Instance-Dependent Noisy Labels","Accepted to ECCV2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep models trained with noisy labels are prone to over-fitting and struggle
in generalization. Most existing solutions are based on an ideal assumption
that the label noise is class-conditional, i.e., instances of the same class
share the same noise model, and are independent of features. While in practice,
the real-world noise patterns are usually more fine-grained as
instance-dependent ones, which poses a big challenge, especially in the
presence of inter-class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage clean
samples identification method to address the aforementioned challenge. First,
we employ a class-level feature clustering procedure for the early
identification of clean samples that are near the class-wise prediction
centers. Notably, we address the class imbalance problem by aggregating rare
classes according to their prediction entropy. Second, for the remaining clean
samples that are close to the ground truth class boundary (usually mixed with
the samples with instance-dependent noises), we propose a novel
consistency-based classification method that identifies them using the
consistency of two classifier heads: the higher the consistency, the larger the
probability that a sample is clean. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method
against the state-of-the-art.

for medical image segmentation. Conventional encoder-decoder models make
pixel-wise predictions focusing heavily on local patterns around the pixel.
This makes it challenging to give segmentation that preserves the object's
shape and topology, which often requires an understanding of the global context
of the object. In this work, we propose a Fourier Coefficient Segmentation
Network~(FCSN) -- a novel DNN-based model that segments an object by learning
the complex Fourier coefficients of the object's masks. The Fourier
coefficients are calculated by integrating over the whole contour. Therefore,
for our model to make a precise estimation of the coefficients, the model is
motivated to incorporate the global context of the object, leading to a more
accurate segmentation of the object's shape. This global context awareness also
makes our model robust to unseen local perturbations during inference, such as
additive noise or motion blur that are prevalent in medical images. When FCSN
is compared with other state-of-the-art models (UNet+, DeepLabV3+, UNETR) on 3
medical image segmentation tasks (ISIC\_2018, RIM\_CUP, RIM\_DISC), FCSN
attains significantly lower Hausdorff scores of 19.14 (6\%), 17.42 (6\%), and
9.16 (14\%) on the 3 tasks, respectively. Moreover, FCSN is lightweight by
discarding the decoder module, which incurs significant computational overhead.
FCSN only requires 22.2M parameters, 82M and 10M fewer parameters than UNETR
and DeepLabV3+. FCSN attains inference and training speeds of 1.6ms/img and
6.3ms/img, that is 8$\times$ and 3$\times$ faster than UNet and UNETR.

variational regularization is the ability of finding global minimizers.
  However, such an assumption is often not feasible when the regularizer is a
black box or non-convex making the search for global minimizers of the involved
Tikhonov functional a challenging task. This is in particular the case for the
emerging class of learned regularizers defined by neural networks. Instead,
standard minimization schemes are applied which typically only guarantee that a
critical point is found. To address this issue, in this paper we study
stability and convergence properties of critical points of Tikhonov functionals
with a possible non-convex regularizer. To this end, we introduce the concept
of relative sub-differentiability and study its basic properties. Based on this
concept, we develop a convergence analysis assuming relative
sub-differentiability of the regularizer. The rationale behind the proposed
concept is that critical points of the Tikhonov functional are also relative
critical points and that for the latter a convergence theory can be developed.
For the case where the noise level tends to zero, we derive a limiting problem
representing first-order optimality conditions of a related restricted
optimization problem. Besides this, we also give a comparison with classical
methods and show that the class of ReLU-networks are appropriate choices for
the regularization functional. Finally, we provide numerical simulations that
support our theoretical findings and the need for the sort of analysis that we

Specifically, we empirically demonstrate that during full-batch training, the
maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian typically equilibrates at a
certain numerical value -- the stability threshold of a gradient descent
algorithm. For Adam with step size $\eta$ and $\beta_1 = 0.9$, this stability
threshold is $38/\eta$. Similar effects occur during minibatch training,
especially as the batch size grows. Yet, even though adaptive methods train at
the ``Adaptive Edge of Stability'' (AEoS), their behavior in this regime
differs in a significant way from that of non-adaptive methods at the EoS.
Whereas non-adaptive algorithms at the EoS are blocked from entering
high-curvature regions of the loss landscape, adaptive gradient methods at the
AEoS can keep advancing into high-curvature regions, while adapting the
preconditioner to compensate. Our findings can serve as a foundation for the

varied the density where quark matter first appears. It is found that when two
almost equal mass binaries merge, the final star attains a stable configuration
(does not collapse) irrespective of the matter properties. However, if the
post-merger scenario of the binary merger can be probed, a significant
difference in the gravitational wave amplitude can be seen if quark matter
appears at low densities. It is found that if the matter properties with
hadronic and quark degrees differ significantly, it is reflected in the
stability of the final merger product. Hadronic matter can give a stable
remnant star, whereas if quark matter appears, it makes the collapse possible
(assuming that the hadronic equation of state is stiffer than the quark
equation of state). However, when unequal mass binaries (the mass difference is
significant) merge, the difference in the observational signals depending on
the equation of state (hadronic or quark) is evident just from the point of

alleviate the $H_0$ tension without increasing the values of $\sigma_{12}$ with
respect to those found in the $\Lambda$CDM, whereas EDE with an exponential
potential does not have any impact on the tensions. A coupling in the dark
sector tends to enhance the clustering of matter, and the data limit a lot the

which transfers sufficient knowledge from label-rich source domain data to
label-free target domain images via Style Alignment and Mixup. Specifically, we
find a more compact and reliable space i.e., feature style space for
perception-oriented UDA based on an interesting/amazing observation, that the
feature style (i.e., the mean and variance) of the deep layer in DNNs is
exactly associated with the quality score in NR-IQA. Therefore, we propose to
align the source and target domains in a more perceptual-oriented space i.e.,
the feature style space, to reduce the intervention from other
quality-irrelevant feature factors. Furthermore, to increase the consistency
between quality score and its feature style, we also propose a novel feature

mean and variance) before the last layer of DNNs together with mixing their

determines in closed form the amplitude of elastic particle scattering. It is
shown that this amplitude of scattering on a nonspherical target cannot be
correctly represented as an expansion into a series of spherical functions , as
is the case for scattering on an atom. Therefore, methods of the scattering

property study. Proposed as a future upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) provides opportunities to
probe quark Yukawa couplings with a high precision because of relatively low
rate from QCD background as compared with that of the Higgs processes at the
LHC. For this purpose, it is important to have a precision prediction of the
Higgs production rate at the LHeC. The leading production channel of the Higgs
boson at the LHeC is via weak boson fusion (WBF) which has the unique kinematic
feature of forward tagging jets. Since there is no color exchange between the
forward-backward objects in WBF processes, electroweak radiative corrections
become particularly important. In this paper, we focus on the electroweak
radiative corrections at next-to-leading order for Higgs boson production in
the WBF channel at the LHeC. In the two renormalization schemes we use, the
loop corrections are respectively at the level of 9% and 18% relative to the
leading order result, and the next-to-leading calculation in both schemes agree
up to a truncation error expected from the perturbative method. The size of the

magnetic background, it could convert into a photon with some probability. In
this paper, a dipole magnetic field is considered as this kind of background in
both the Minkowski spacetime and the curved spacetime in the near-zone of a
neutron star. In the former case, we find that the graviton traveling
vertically rather than parallel to the background magnetic field could be more
effectively converted into an electromagnetic radiation field. In the latter
case, we focus on the situation, in which the graviton travels along the radial
direction near a neutron star. The radius of a neutron star is about ten
kilometers, so the gravitational wave with long wavelength or low frequency may
bypass neutron stars by diffraction. For high frequency gravitational wave, the
conversion probability is proportional to the distance square as that in the
static electric or magnetic background case. The smaller the inclination angle
between the dipole field and the neutron star north pole is, the larger
magnetic amplitude will be. The term that described curved spacetime will
slightly enhance this kind of probability. We estimate that this value is about
the order of $\sim 10^{-14}- 10^{-10}$. Therefore, it is expectable that this
kind of conversion process may have a potential to open a window for observing
high frequency gravitational waves.

operate an unmanned aircraft with minimal risk to people on the ground. The
purpose of this study is to define and measure such risks as population risk,
by incorporating spatiotemporal changes in population density. Unlike previous
studies, we use high-resolution de facto population data instead of residential
population data to reflect the spatiotemporal characteristics of population
distribution. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of mitigation measures based
on population risk in the context of airspace management. We set a restricted
airspace by using population risk and an acceptable level of safety. Scenario
analysis of the study area in Seoul, South Korea provides a richer set of
findings regarding spatiotemporal differences in restricted airspace. During
the daytime, there are many restricted airspaces around commercial areas, but
few around residential areas. Additionally, we observe the difference between
restricting airspace based on population risk derived from the residential
population and from the de facto population. These findings confirm the
importance of accurately considering population density when assessing and
mitigating the population risk associated with UAS operations. Sensitivity
analysis also reveals the need to precisely estimate population density when
estimating population risk with combinations of multiple parameter values. The
proposed approach captures spatiotemporal characteristics of population
distribution when assessing the population risk associated with UAS.

a polygon formation in a self-organized manner. Different from the typical
formation control strategies where robots are steered to satisfy the predefined
control variables, such as pairwise distances, relative positions and bearings,
the foremost idea of this paper is to achieve polygon formations by injecting
control inputs randomly to a few robots (say, vertex robots) of the group, and
the rest follow the simple principles of moving towards the midpoint of their
two nearest neighbors in the ring graph without any external inputs. In our
problem, a fleet of robots is initially distributed in the plane. The socalled
vertex robots take the responsibility of determining the geometric shape of the
entire formation and its overall size, while the others move so as to minimize
the differences with two direct neighbors. In the first step, each vertex robot
estimates the number of robots in its associated chain. Two types of control
inputs that serve for the estimation are designed using the measurements from
the latest and the last two time instants respectively. In the second step, the
self-organized formation control law is proposed where only vertex robots
receive external information. Comparisons between the two estimation strategies
are carried out in terms of the convergence speed and robustness. The
effectiveness of the whole control framework is further validated in both
simulation and physical experiments.

noble metals to go beyond a simple electromagnetic modelling of low electron
density Drude materials and provide an electron dynamics model for their

momentum conservation in electron-phonon interactions more important, more
complex and more sensitive to the temperatures compared with noble metals;
moreover, we find that electron-electron interactions are becoming more
effective due to the weaker screening. Most importantly, we show that the low
electron density makes the electron heat capacity much smaller than in noble
metals, such that the electrons in LEDD materials tend to heat up much more and
cool down faster compared to noble metals. While here we focus on indium tin

sampled paths and with an intrinsic difficulty in parallelizing the sampling

in Fock's nonlinear relativity (FNLR), the laws of electrodynamics depend on
the particle mass which therefore constitutes a common point between the two
extended forms of special relativity. As one consequence, the corresponding
equation of motion contains two different types of contributions. In addition
to the usual type, another one emerges as a consequence of the coexistence of
mass and charge which are coupled with the k-deformation and electromagnetic

wherein the background energy density vanishes at the bounce point, in the

of density fluctuations ($\delta \rho$) may be strong in the bounce phase,
which potentially provides a mechanism to enhance the abundance of primordial
black holes (PBHs). This article presents a comprehensive illustration for PBH
enhancement due to the bounce phase. To calculate the non-linear evolution of
$\delta \rho$, the Raychaudhuri equation is numerically solved here. Since the
non-linear processes may lead to a non-Gaussian probability distribution
function for $\delta \rho$ after the bounce point, the PBH abundance is
calculated in a modified Press-Schechter formalism. In this case, the criterion
of PBH formation is complicated, due to complicated non-linear evolutionary
behavior of $\delta \rho$ during the bounce phase. Our results indicate that
the bounce phase indeed has potential to enhance the PBH abundance
sufficiently. Furthermore, the PBH abundance is applied to constrain the
parameters of bounce phase, providing a complementary to the surveys of cosmic

We also give $p$-Wasserstein bounds with all $p\geq2$ and a Cram\'er type

optimal under the KLS conjecture. To prove these bounds, we develop a new
Gaussian coupling inequality that gives almost dimension-free bounds for

this coupling inequality by combining Stein's method and Eldan's stochastic

in more energy-efficient machines without compromising performance. However,
machine builders do not actually use the potential described in the literature
as these methods require too much theoretical analysis.
  This paper introduces a convenient optimization workflow allowing wide
industrial adoption, by using CAD models. The 3D multi-body software is used to
perform motion simulations, from which the objective value samples can be
extracted. These motion simulations determine the required torque for a certain
combination of design parameters to fulfill the movement. Dedicated software
can execute multiple motion simulations sequentially and interchange data
between the different simulations, which automates the process of retrieving
objective value samples. Therefore, without in-depth analytical design
analysis, a machine designer can evaluate multiple designs at low cost.
Moreover, by implementing an optimization algorithm, an optimal design can be
found that meets the objective. In a case study of a coronaventilator mechanism
with three design parameters (DP's), 39 CAD motion simulations allowed to
reduce the RMS torque of the mechanism by 57.2% in 42 minutes.

spatial-temporal trajectory mining, and is beneficial for a wide range of
downstream tasks. The key for generating effective trajectory embeddings is to
extract high-level travel semantics from trajectories, including movement
patterns and travel purposes, with consideration of the trajectories' long-term
spatial-temporal correlations. Despite the existing efforts, there are still
major challenges in pre-training trajectory embeddings. First, commonly used
generative pretext tasks are not suitable for extracting high-level semantics
from trajectories. Second, existing data augmentation methods fit badly on
trajectory datasets. Third, current encoder designs fail to fully incorporate
long-term spatial-temporal correlations hidden in trajectories. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel Contrastive Spatial-Temporal Trajectory
Embedding (CSTTE) model for learning comprehensive trajectory embeddings. CSTTE
adopts the contrastive learning framework so that its pretext task is robust to
noise. A specially designed data augmentation method for trajectories is
coupled with the contrastive pretext task to preserve the high-level travel
semantics. We also build an efficient spatial-temporal trajectory encoder to
efficiently and comprehensively model the long-term spatial-temporal
correlations in trajectories. Extensive experiments on two downstream tasks and
three real-world datasets prove the superiority of our model compared with the

However, IoT devices were not built with security in mind, which might lead to
security vulnerabilities in a multi-device system. Traditionally, we
investigated IoT issues by polling IoT developers and specialists. This
technique, however, is not scalable since surveying all IoT developers is not
feasible. Another way to look into IoT issues is to look at IoT developer
discussions on major online development forums like Stack Overflow (SO).
However, finding discussions that are relevant to IoT issues is challenging
since they are frequently not categorized with IoT-related terms. In this
paper, we present the ""IoT Security Dataset"", a domain-specific dataset of 7147
samples focused solely on IoT security discussions. As there are no automated
tools to label these samples, we manually labeled them. We further employed
multiple transformer models to automatically detect security discussions.
Through rigorous investigations, we found that IoT security discussions are
different and more complex than traditional security discussions. We
demonstrated a considerable performance loss (up to 44%) of transformer models
on cross-domain datasets when we transferred knowledge from a general-purpose
dataset ""Opiner"", supporting our claim. Thus, we built a domain-specific IoT

pruning, which can eliminate important elements together with unimportant

reparameterization method, called TileTrans, to reduce the loss of tile
pruning. Specifically, we repermute the rows or columns of the weight matrix
such that the model architecture can be kept unchanged after
reparameterization. This repermutation realizes the reparameterization of the
DNN model without any retraining. The proposed reparameterization method
combines important elements into the same tile; thus, preserving the important
elements after the tile pruning. Furthermore, TileTrans can be seamlessly
integrated into existing tile pruning methods because it is a pre-processing
method executed before pruning, which is orthogonal to most existing methods.
The experimental results demonstrate that our method is essential in reducing
the loss of tile pruning on DNNs. Specifically, the accuracy is improved by up
to 17% for AlexNet while 5% for ResNet-34, where both models are pre-trained on
ImageNet.

small objects; (2) inter-scale problem: the existing methods failed to explore
distinctive information from multiple scales, which may hinder the
representation learning from objects with widely variable size, shape and

transformer-based global cues in each scale, where the row-wise and column-wise
global dependencies can be extracted by a lightweight Dual-Axis MSA. (2) A

to their low surface brightness (LSB). To recover these LSB features by
minimizing the photometric uncertainties introduced by the optical system, we
developed a new optimized telescope named K-DRIFT pathfinder, adopting a linear
astigmatism free-three mirror system. Thanks to the off-axis design, it is
expected to avoid the loss and scattering of light on the optical path within
the telescope. To assess the performance of this prototype telescope, we

  Sampling Simulations",,,,,"physics.chem-ph cs.LG physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enhanced sampling methods are indispensable in computational physics and
chemistry, where atomistic simulations cannot exhaustively sample the
high-dimensional configuration space of dynamical systems due to the sampling
problem. A class of such enhanced sampling methods works by identifying a few
slow degrees of freedom, termed collective variables (CVs), and enhancing the
sampling along these CVs. Selecting CVs to analyze and drive the sampling is
not trivial and often relies on physical and chemical intuition. Despite
routinely circumventing this issue using manifold learning to estimate CVs
directly from standard simulations, such methods cannot provide mappings to a
low-dimensional manifold from enhanced sampling simulations as the geometry and
density of the learned manifold are biased. Here, we address this crucial issue
and provide a general reweighting framework based on anisotropic diffusion maps
for manifold learning that takes into account that the learning data set is
sampled from a biased probability distribution. We consider manifold learning
methods based on constructing a Markov chain describing transition
probabilities between high-dimensional samples. We show that our framework
reverts the biasing effect yielding CVs that correctly describe the equilibrium
density. This advancement enables the construction of low-dimensional CVs using
manifold learning directly from data generated by enhanced sampling
simulations. We call our framework reweighted manifold learning. We show that
it can be used in many manifold learning techniques on data from both standard
and enhanced sampling simulations.

real-time risk assessment. Also, this information can be used in cooperative
robots and monitoring systems to evaluate and interact in the environment more
freely. Furthermore, the workspace area can be more deterministic with the

a novel predictive safety model (PSM) that relies on the information of an
inertial measurement unit on the human chest. The PSM encompasses a 3-Dofs
spring-damper pendulum model that predicts human motion based on a safe motion

central extended little groups of the SO(3,1) group as gauge group is the
underlying geometric structure for a unified theory of the fundamental physical
interactions. Based on this hypothesis as a first step recently I presented a
generalized theory of electroweak interaction which includes hypothetical dark
matter particles (Eur. Phys. J C 79, 779 (2019). The vertical Laplacian of the
tangent bundle possesses the same form as the Hamiltonian of a 2D semiconductor
quantum Hall system. This explains fractional charge quantization of quarks and
the existence of lepton and quark families. As will be shown the SU(3) colour
symmetry for strong interaction arises in the TB as an emergent symmetry
similar as Chern-Simon gauge symmetries in quantum Hall systems. This predicts
a signature of quark confinement as an universal large-scale property of the
Chern-Simon fields and induces a new understanding of the vacuum as the ground
state occupied with a condensate of quark-antiquark pairs. The gap for
quark-antiquark pairing is calculated in the mean-field approximation which
allows a numerical estimation of the characteristic parameters of the vacuum
such as its chemical potential, the quark condensation parameter and the vacuum
energy. Note that previously a gauge theoretical understanding of gravity has
been achieved by considering the translation group T(3,1) in the TB as gauge
group. Therefore the theory presented here can be considered as a new type of
unified theory for all known fundamental interactions linked with the
geometrization program of physics.

updates. To alleviate this problem, we propose a sample-efficient method named
cyclic policy distillation (CPD). CPD divides the range of randomized
parameters into several small sub-domains and assigns a local policy to each
one. Then local policies are learned while cyclically transitioning to
sub-domains. CPD accelerates learning through knowledge transfer based on
expected performance improvements. Finally, all of the learned local policies
are distilled into a global policy for sim-to-real transfers. CPD's
effectiveness and sample efficiency are demonstrated through simulations with
four tasks (Pendulum from OpenAIGym and Pusher, Swimmer, and HalfCheetah from

quadrature formulas of the form $\int_a^b f(x) d\mu(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i
f(x_i)$ where $f$ belongs to $H^1(\mu)$. Here, $\mu$ belongs to a class of
continuous probability distributions on $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ and
$\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \delta_{x_i}$ is a discrete probability distribution on $[a,
b]$. We show that $H^1(\mu)$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with a
continuous kernel $K$, which allows to reformulate the quadrature question as a
Bayesian (or kernel) quadrature problem. Although $K$ has not an easy closed
form in general, we establish a correspondence between its spectral
decomposition and the one associated to Poincar\'e inequalities, whose common
eigenfunctions form a $T$-system (Karlin and Studden, 1966). The quadrature
problem can then be solved in the finite-dimensional proxy space spanned by the
first eigenfunctions. The solution is given by a generalized Gaussian
quadrature, which we call Poincar\'e quadrature. We derive several results for
the Poincar\'e quadrature weights and the associated worst-case error. When
$\mu$ is the uniform distribution, the results are explicit: the Poincar\'e
quadrature is equivalent to the midpoint (rectangle) quadrature rule. Its nodes
coincide with the zeros of an eigenfunction and the worst-case error scales as
$\frac{b-a}{2\sqrt{3}}n^{-1}$ for large $n$. By comparison with known results
for $H^1(0,1)$, this shows that the Poincar\'e quadrature is asymptotically
optimal. For a general $\mu$, we provide an efficient numerical procedure,
based on finite elements and linear programming. Numerical experiments provide
useful insights: nodes are nearly evenly spaced, weights are close to the
probability density at nodes, and the worst-case error is approximately
$O(n^{-1})$ for large $n$.

Growth-induced instabilities are examined for a different range of fiber

quasi-incompressible and quasiinextensible limits of transversely isotropic
materials were considered. A numerical example was solved by implementing the
T2P0F0 element on an automated differential equation solver platform, FEniCS.
It was shown that both the wavelength and critical growth parameter g decrease
by increasing the fiber stiffness for the first instability, which is obtained
along the stiff fiber direction. The effect of the fiber stiffness is minor on
the secondary buckling, which was observed perpendicular to the fiber
direction. For a range of fiber stiffnesses, bifurcation points of
instabilities were also determined by monitoring displacements and energies.
The energy contributions of layerswith different ranges of fiber stiffnesses
were examined. It is concluded that the energy release mechanism at the
initiation of the primary buckling is mainly due to isotropic and anisotropic
contributions of the stiff filmlayer. For high fiber stiffnesses, the effect of
the anisotropic energy on the first buckling becomes more dominant over other
types. However, in the secondary instability, the isotropic energy of the film
layer becomes the dominant one. Numerical outcomes of this study will help to
understand the fiber stiffness effect on the buckling and post-buckling

from all the existing works where IRS has already been deployed at a fixed

location of IRS, transmit beamformer and IRS phase shifts with imperfect
channel state information (CSI) of Eve, where we consider two cases: a) the
location of Eve is known; b) only a suspicious area of Eve is available. We
show a critical observation that CSI models are different before and after IRS
deployment, thus the optimization problem could be decomposed and solved via a
two-stage framework. For case a), in the first stage, universal upper bounds of
outage probabilities only related to the location of IRS are derived which can
be optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA) method. In the second
stage, we develop an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize
beamformer and phase shifts iteratively. For case b), we propose a Max-Min SR

implements all this functionality in a Blade server instance, which can be

messaging service or an online social network. Based on the Oracle GraalVM,
Blade modules can be implemented in a variety of programming languages and
utilize the functionality provided by the Blade server instance. Blade modules

semantic descriptions shared between seen classes and unseen classes. Current
methods show that it is effective to learn visual-semantic alignment by
projecting semantic embeddings into the visual space as class prototypes.
However, such a projection function is only concerned with seen classes. When
applied to unseen classes, the prototypes often perform suboptimally due to
domain shift. In this paper, we propose to learn prototypes via placeholders,
termed LPL, to eliminate the domain shift between seen and unseen classes.
Specifically, we combine seen classes to hallucinate new classes which play as
placeholders of the unseen classes in the visual and semantic space. Placed
between seen classes, the placeholders encourage prototypes of seen classes to
be highly dispersed. And more space is spared for the insertion of
well-separated unseen ones. Empirically, well-separated prototypes help
counteract visual-semantic misalignment caused by domain shift. Furthermore, we
exploit a novel semantic-oriented fine-tuning to guarantee the semantic
reliability of placeholders. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the significant performance gain of LPL over the state-of-the-art

applications, as they can be designed appropriately for specific needs. The
realization of new compounds, however, requires the appropriate experimental
characterizations, also from the mechanical point of view, which is typically
carried out by analyzing the vibrations of beams, but which still have some
unclear aspects, with respect to the well-known dynamics of elastic beams. To
address this shortcoming, the paper deals with the theoretical modelling of a
viscoelastic beam dynamics, and pursues the elucidation of underlying how the
flexural vibrations may be affected when an axial preload, compressive or
tensile, is applied. The analytical model presented, is able to shed light on a
peculiar behaviour, which is strongly related to the frequency dependent
damping induced by viscoelasticity. By considering as an example a real
polymer, i.e. a synthetic rubber, it is disclosed that an axial preload, in
certain conditions, may enhance or suppress the oscillatory counterpart of a
resonance peak of the beam, depending on both the frequency distribution of the
complex modulus and the length of the beam. The analytical model is assessed by
a Finite Element Model (FEM), and it turns out to be an essential tool for
understanding the dynamics of viscoelastic beams, typically exploited to
experimentally characterize polymeric materials, and which could vary
enormously simply through the application of constraints and ensued preloads.

large graphs by their high level properties is helpful in solving problems in
these settings. In spectral clustering, we aim to identify clusters of nodes
where most edges fall within clusters and only few edges fall between clusters.
This task is important for many downstream applications and exploratory
analysis. A core step of spectral clustering is performing an
eigendecomposition of the corresponding graph Laplacian matrix (or
equivalently, a singular value decomposition, SVD, of the incidence matrix).
The convergence of iterative singular value decomposition approaches depends on
the eigengaps of the spectrum of the given matrix, i.e., the difference between
consecutive eigenvalues. For a graph Laplacian corresponding to a
well-clustered graph, the eigenvalues will be non-negative but very small (much
less than $1$) slowing convergence. This paper introduces a parallelizable
approach to dilating the spectrum in order to accelerate SVD solvers and in
turn, spectral clustering. This is accomplished via polynomial approximations
to matrix operations that favorably transform the spectrum of a matrix without
changing its eigenvectors. Experiments demonstrate that this approach
significantly accelerates convergence, and we explain how this transformation
can be parallelized and stochastically approximated to scale with available
compute.

behind the performance gain by the EIM-based neural scheduler. Third, we
discover that the ratio of the average processing elements (PE) switching delay
and the average PE computation time significantly impacts the performance of
neural SoC schedulers even with EIM. Consequently, future neural SoC scheduler

numerical weather forecasting over short timescales. However the applicability
of these reduced precision techniques to longer timescale climate simulations -
especially those which seek to describe a dynamical, changing climate - remains
unclear. We investigate this question by deploying a global atmospheric, coarse
resolution model known as SPEEDY to simulate a changing climate system subject
to increased $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations, over a 100 year timescale. Whilst
double precision is typically the operational standard for climate modelling,
we find that reduced precision solutions (Float32, Float16) are sufficiently
accurate. Rounding the finite precision floats stochastically, rather than
using the more common ``round-to-nearest"" technique, notably improves the
performance of the reduced precision solutions. Over 100 years the mean bias
error (MBE) in the global mean surface temperature (precipitation) relative to
the double precision solution is $+2 \times 10^{-4}$K ($-8 \times 10^{-5}$
mm/6hr) at single precision and $-3.5\times 10^{-2}$ K($-1 \times 10^{-2}$
mm/6hr) at half precision, whilst the inclusion of stochastic rounding reduced
the half precision error to +1.8 $\times 10^{-2}$ K ($-8 \times10^{-4}$
mm/6hr). By examining the resultant climatic distributions that arise after 100
years, the difference in the expected value of the global surface temperature,
relative to the double precision solution is $\leq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ K and for
precipitation $8 \times 10^{-4}$ mm/6h when numerically integrating at half
precision with stochastic rounding. Areas of the model which notably improve
due to the inclusion of stochastic over deterministic rounding are also
explored and discussed. [abridged]

high angular resolution, covering diffuse and quiescent clouds, and those
showing low-, intermediate-, and high-mass star formation (SF), and
characterize the cloud structure using the Delta-variance tool. The N-PDFs are
double-log-normal at low column densities, and display one or two power law
tails (PLTs) at higher column densities. For diffuse, quiescent, and low-mass
SF clouds, we propose that the two log-normals arise from the atomic and
molecular phase, respectively. For massive clouds, we suggest that the first
log-normal is built up by turbulently mixed H2 and the second one by compressed
(via stellar feedback) molecular gas. Nearly all clouds have two PLTs with
slopes consistent with self-gravity, where the second one can be flatter or
steeper than the first one. A flatter PLT could be caused by stellar feedback
or other physical processes that slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass
toward higher densities. The steeper slope could arise if the magnetic field is
oriented perpendicular to the LOS column density distribution. The first
deviation point (DP), where the N-PDF turns from log-normal into a PLT, shows a
clustering around values of a visual extinction of AV (DP1) around 2-5. The
second DP, which defines the break between the two PLTs, varies strongly. Using
the Delta-variance, we observe that the AV value, where the slope changes
between the first and second PLT, increases with the characteristic size scale
in the variance spectrum. We conclude that at low column densities, atomic and
molecular gas is turbulently mixed, while at high column densities, the gas is
fully molecular and dominated by self-gravity. The best fitting model N-PDFs of
molecular clouds is thus one with log-normal low column density distributions,
followed by one or two PLTs.

manifestations in a plethora of systems. In this work, we systematically
investigate the role of non-Hermiticity in the Chern insulating Haldane model
on a dice lattice. Due to the presence of a non-dispersive flat band, the
dice-Haldane model hosts a topologically rich phase diagram with the
non-trivial phases accommodating Chern numbers $\pm 2$. We introduce
non-Hermiticity into this model in two ways -- through balanced non-Hermitian
gain and loss, and by non-reciprocal hopping in one direction. Both these types
of non-Hermiticity induce higher-order exceptional points of order three. We
substantiate the presence and the order of these higher-order exceptional
points using the phase rigidity and its scaling. Further, we construct a phase
diagram to identify and locate the occurrence of these exceptional points in
the parameter space. Non-Hermiticity has yet more interesting consequences on a
finite-sized lattice. Unlike for balanced gain and loss, in the case of
non-reciprocal hopping, the nearest-neighbour dice lattice system under
periodic boundary conditions accommodates a finite, non-zero spectral area in
the complex plane. This manifests as the non-Hermitian skin effect when open
boundary conditions are invoked. In the more general case of the dice-Haldane
lattice model, the non-Hermitian skin effect can be caused by both gain and
loss or non-reciprocity. Fascinatingly, the direction of localization of the
eigenstates depends on the nature and strength of the non-Hermiticity. We
establish the occurrence of the skin effect using the local density of states,
inverse participation ratio and the edge probability, and demonstrate its
robustness to disorder. Our results place the dice-Haldane model as an exciting
platform to explore non-Hermitian physics.

to study a wide range of quantum phenomena. Such systems can be realized in
optical lattices filled with ultracold atomic gases. In this paper we study the
Bose-Hubbard model in the Lieb lattice by means of the time-dependent
Gutzwiller mean-field approach. We find that in the Mott insulator phase the
excitation modes are gapped and display purely particle or purely hole

The geometry of the Lieb lattice leads to a non-uniform order parameter and
non-uniform oscillation energy in the ground state. This results in additional
anti-crossings between dispersive bands in the excitation spectra, while the
flat bands remain insensitive to this effect. We analyze the oscillations of
the order parameter on the sublattices as well as the particle-hole character
of the excitations. For certain model parameters we find simultaneous pure
phase and pure amplitude oscillations within the same mode, separated between
the sublattices. Also, we propose a simple method to differentiate between the
hole- and particle superfluid regions in the Lieb lattice by in-situ
measurement of the atom population on the sublattices.

show that when domain boundaries are between the top two graphene layers,

only provides a weak distinction between the inequivalent stackings in the

dispersive features are more pronounced in the self-gravitational domains

decelerating (accelerating) and destabilizing (stabilizing) influences on the

that their atomic lattices may become dynamic and undergo reconfigurations even
well-below the melting temperature. The innate atomic dynamics of metals is
directly related to their bulk and surface properties. Understanding their
complex structural dynamics is thus important for many applications but is not
easy. Here we report deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations allowing to
resolve at atomic-resolution the complex dynamics of various types of copper
(Cu) surfaces, used as an example, near the H\""uttig ($\sim1/3$ of melting)
temperature. The development of a deep neural network potential trained on DFT
calculations provides a dynamically-accurate force field that we use to
simulate large atomistic models of different Cu surface types. A combination of
high-dimensional structural descriptors and unsupervised machine learning
allows identifying and tracking all the atomic environments (AEs) emerging in
the surfaces at finite temperatures. We can directly observe how AEs that are
non-native in a specific (ideal) surface, but that are instead typical of other
surface types, continuously emerge/disappear in that surface in relevant
regimes in dynamic equilibrium with the native ones. Our analyses allow
estimating the lifetime of all the AEs populating these Cu surfaces and to
reconstruct their dynamic interconversions networks. This reveals the elusive
identity of these metal surfaces, which preserve their identity only in part
and in part transform into something else in relevant conditions. This also
proposes a concept of ""statistical identity"" for metal surfaces, which is key

between the graphene layer and the buffer layer at the growth temperature

graphene on silicon carbide is close to a phase transition, causing intrinsic
disorder in the form of co-existence of anisotropic stripe domains and
isotropic trigonal domains. Using adaptive geometric phase analysis, we
determine the precise relative strain variation caused by these domains. We

different parties (e.g., organizations or enterprises) to collaboratively build

only exchanges the intermediate statistics, i.e., forward activations and
backward derivatives, across parties to compute model gradients. Nevertheless,
due to its geo-distributed nature, VFL training usually suffers from the low
WAN bandwidth.
  In this paper, we introduce CELU-VFL, a novel and efficient VFL training
framework that exploits the local update technique to reduce the cross-party
communication rounds. CELU-VFL caches the stale statistics and reuses them to
estimate model gradients without exchanging the ad hoc statistics. Significant
techniques are proposed to improve the convergence performance. First, to
handle the stochastic variance problem, we propose a uniform sampling strategy
to fairly choose the stale statistics for local updates. Second, to harness the
errors brought by the staleness, we devise an instance weighting mechanism that
measures the reliability of the estimated gradients. Theoretical analysis
proves that CELU-VFL achieves a similar sub-linear convergence rate as vanilla
VFL training but requires much fewer communication rounds. Empirical results on
both public and real-world workloads validate that CELU-VFL can be up to six
times faster than the existing works.

  MeditCom 2022",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-geostationary (Non-GSO) satellite constellations have emerged as a
promising solution to enable ubiquitous high-speed low-latency broadband
services by generating multiple spot-beams placed on the ground according to
the user locations. However, there is an inherent trade-off between the number
of active beams and the complexity of generating a large number of beams. This
paper formulates and solves a joint beam placement and load balancing problem
to carefully optimize the satellite beam and enhance the link budgets with a
minimal number of active beams. We propose a two-stage algorithm design to
overcome the combinatorial structure of the considered optimization problem
providing a solution in polynomial time. The first stage minimizes the number
of active beams, while the second stage performs a load balancing to distribute
users in the coverage area of the active beams. Numerical results confirm the
benefits of the proposed methodology both in carrier-to-noise ratio and
multiplexed users per beam over other benchmarks.

with the problem of determining the maximum number of limit cycles that these
differential systems can have. This problem has been usually approached via
large case-by-case analyses which distinguish the many different possibilities
for the spectra of the matrices of the differential systems. Here, by using a
novel integral characterization of Poincar\'e half-maps, we prove, without
unnecessary distinctions of matrix spectra, that the optimal uniform upper
bound for the number of limit cycles of these differential systems is one. In
addition, it is proven that this limit cycle, if it exists, is hyperbolic and
its stability is determined by a simple condition in terms of the parameters of
the system. As a byproduct of our analysis, a condition for the existence of
the limit cycle is also derived.

controlling high degree-of-freedom (DoF) complex robotic systems. However, they
come at a high computational cost and an update rate of about tens of hertz.
This relatively slow update rate hinders the possibility of stable haptic
teleoperation of such systems since the slow feedback loops can cause
instabilities and loss of transparency to the operator. This work presents a
novel framework for transparent teleoperation of MPC-controlled complex robotic
systems. In particular, we employ a feedback MPC approach and exploit its
structure to account for the operator input at a fast rate which is independent
of the update rate of the MPC loop itself. We demonstrate our framework on a
mobile manipulator platform and show that it significantly improves haptic
teleoperation's transparency and stability. We also highlight that the proposed
feedback structure is constraint satisfactory and does not violate any
constraints defined in the optimal control problem. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first realization of the bilateral teleoperation of
a legged manipulator using a whole-body MPC framework.

for planets on circular orbits to predict the morphology of the density wake.
In this work we develop and implement a linear framework for calculating the
structure of the density wave in a gaseous disc driven by an eccentric planet.
Our approach takes into account both the essential azimuthal and temporal
periodicities of the problem, allowing us to treat any periodic perturbing
potential (i.e. not only that of an eccentric planet). We test our framework by
calculating the morphology of the density waves excited by an eccentric,
low-mass planet embedded in a globally isothermal disc and compare our results
to the recent direct numerical simulations (and heuristic wavelet analysis) of
the same problem by Zhu and Zhang. We find excellent agreement with the
numerical simulations, capturing all the complex eccentric features including
spiral bifurcations, wave crossings and planet-wave detachments, with improved
accuracy and detail compared with the wavelet method. This illustrates the
power of our linear framework in reproducing the morphology of complicated
time-dependent density wakes, presenting it as a valuable tool for future
studies of eccentric planet-disc interactions.

primarily designed to detect the dominant gravitational-wave mode and assume
that the binary components have spins which are aligned with the orbital
angular momentum. These choices lead to observational biases in the observed
distribution of sources. Sources with significant spin-orbit precession or
unequal-mass-ratios, which have non-negligible contributions from sub-dominant
gravitational-wave modes, may be missed; in particular, this may significantly
suppress or bias the observed neutron star -- black hole (NSBH) population. We
simulate a fiducial population of NSBH mergers and determine the impact of
using searches that only account for the dominant-mode and aligned spin. We
compare the impact for the Advanced LIGO design, A+, LIGO Voyager, and Cosmic

distribution is isotropic in orientation and uniform in magnitude, we will miss
$\sim 25\%$ of sources with mass-ratio $q > 6$ and up to $\sim 60 \%$ of highly
precessing sources $(\chi_p > 0.5)$, after accounting for the approximate
increase in background. In practice, the true observational bias can be even
larger due to strict signal-consistency tests applied in searches. The
observation of low spin, unequal-mass-ratio sources by Advanced LIGO design and
Advanced Virgo may in part be due to these selection effects. The development
of a search sensitive to high mass-ratio, precessing sources may allow the
detection of new binaries whose spin properties would provide key insights into

that we do not know from the Solar System. Wing-wing interaction is such an
example, where the Alfv\'en wings of two planets merge and interact
non-linearly. In this paper we focus on the effects that SPI has on other
planets and the stellar wind. First, we analyse the different wave structures
connected to SPI. The second part then investigates wing-wing interaction. Our
study applies a magnetohydrodynamic model to describe a stellar system with
multiple possible planets. As an example, we chose TRAPPIST-1 and its two
innermost planets. We extended the PLUTO code to simulate collisions between
atmospheric neutral particles and plasma ions. Neutral gas clouds imitate the
planets and move through the simulation domain. That allows the simulation of
fully time-dependent stellar systems. We analysed the wave structures, which
result from the interaction between stellar wind and TRAPPIST-1 b. The inward
going wave structure is an Alfv\'en wing. The outward going part of the
interaction consists of an Alfv\'en wing, slow mode waves, the planetary wake
and a slow shock. We quantified the strength of the respective wave
perturbations at the outer planets to be on the order of 10\% to 40\% of the
local background values of thermal, magnetic and dynamic pressure. Wing-wing
interaction occurs due to the relative position of two planets during their
conjunction and shows three phases. First there is an initial, non-linear
intensification of the Poynting flux by $20\%$, an intermediate phase with
reduced Poynting flux and a third phase when the Alfv\'en wing of planet c goes
through planet b's wave structures with another intensification of the Poynting
flux.

the singlet fermionic dark matter in the scotogenic model. It is known that
this dark matter candidate tends to conflict with the relevant constraints such
as the neutrino oscillation data and charged lepton flavor violating processes
if its thermal production mechanism is assumed. We find that the dark matter
production mechanisms are modified by first-order phase transitions at some
specific parameter regions, where the phase transitions can be one-step or
two-step depending on the parameters. If the phase transition is one-step, a
sufficiently low nucleation temperature is required to reproduce the observed
relic abundance of dark matter. If the phase transition is two-step, the dark
matter should never be thermalized, otherwise the abundance would remain too
much and overclose the universe. This is because the nucleation temperature
cannot be low as in the one-step case. Therefore we require another way of dark
matter production, the freeze-in mechanism for the two-step case. We show that
the freeze-in mechanism is modified by the temporary vacuum expectation value
of the inert scalar field. In both cases, the first-order phase transitions
could produce observable gravitational wave spectra. In particular for the
one-step phase transition, the generated gravitational waves with sizable
energy density are intrinsically correlated with the dark matter production
mechanism, and can be detectable by future space-based interferometers.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for humanity to reach by 2030. Society is
involved in the challenge, with firms playing a crucial role. Thus, a key
question is to what extent firms engage with the SDGs. Efforts to map firms'
contributions have mainly focused on analysing companies' reports based on
limited samples and non-real-time data. We present a novel interdisciplinary
approach based on analysing big data from an online social network (Twitter)
with complex network methods from statistical physics. By doing so, we provide
a comprehensive and nearly real-time picture of firms' engagement with SDGs.
Results show that: 1) SDGs themes tie conversations among major UK firms
together; 2) the social dimension is predominant; 3) the attention to different
SDGs themes varies depending on the community and sector firms belong to; 4)
stakeholder engagement is higher on posts related to global challenges compared
to general ones; 5) large UK companies and stakeholders generally behave
differently from Italian ones. This paper provides theoretical contributions
and practical implications relevant to firms, policymakers and management
education. Most importantly, it provides a novel tool and a set of keywords to
monitor the influence of the private sector on the implementation of the 2030

Pixie III is a PCD using simultaneously two energy thresholds. This enables to

context, one has however to deal with an energy bin optimization: narrow energy
bins lead to high KES signal at the expense of higher noise, while wider energy
bins lead to poor KES signal but better statistics. This work presents a model
that aims at finding the optimal energy thresholds and source voltage in order

model also optimizes the parameters for conventional absorption modality and
compares both modalities. Since the input flux and the energy difference
between the thresholds influence image noise, this is included in the model
using phenomenological laws. The model is then compared to empirical
optimization by experimental screening of the parameters using model materials
composed of barium, iodine and water. Finally, it is explained how to model the

particularly useful when absolute sensors, like GPS, are not available. Here we
propose the Iterative Closest Ellipsoidal Transform (ICET), a scan matching
algorithm which provides two novel improvements over the current
state-of-the-art Normal Distributions Transform (NDT). Like NDT, ICET
decomposes lidar data into voxels and fits a Gaussian distribution to the
points within each voxel. The first innovation of ICET reduces geometric
ambiguity along large flat surfaces by suppressing the solution along those
directions. The second innovation of ICET is to infer the output error
covariance associated with the position and orientation transformation between
successive point clouds; the error covariance is particularly useful when ICET
is incorporated into a state-estimation routine such as an extended Kalman
filter. We constructed a simulation to compare the performance of ICET and NDT
in 2D space both with and without geometric ambiguity and found that ICET
produces superior estimates while accurately predicting solution accuracy.

causing damage to the DNA, cells, and production of Reactive Oxygen Species
(ROS) among other things. While direct exposure to high radiation dose is
indeed not favorable for biological activity, ionizing radiation can, and in
some cases is known to produce a number of biologically useful products. One
such mechanism is the production of biologically useful products via charged
particle-induced radiolysis. Energetic charged particles interact with surfaces
of planetary objects such as Mars, Europa and Enceladus without much shielding
from their rarefied atmospheres. Depending on the energy of said particles,
they can penetrate several meters deep below the surface and initiate a number
of chemical reactions along the way. Some of the byproducts are impossible to
produce with lower-energy radiation (such as sunlight), opening up new avenues
for life to utilize them. For each of these cases, we calculate the energy
deposition rate as a function of depth, and estimate the energy availability
for potential metabolic activity. We discuss various mechanisms through which
life could support itself utilizing the byproducts of these ionizing
radiation-induced reactions, such as chemoautotrophs using solvated electrons,
extracellular electron transfer, and indirect electrophy to facilitate
processes like carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation and sulfate reduction, and
possibly for ATP production.

increase up to 20 %. For all the considered forecasting methods, we show that
such a gain is far better than the one obtained by considering other kind of
information like local weather variables or seeking for an optimal deep
learning model. Moreover we provide evidence that non-linear models, as neural
networks or gradient boosting methods, significantly outperform linear
regression. These conclusions are simply interpreted as resulting from the
ability of a method to capture the transport of the information by the main

high redshift ($z\gtrsim 6$) are expected to suffer from field-to-field
variance, including cosmic and Poisson variances. Future surveys, such as those
from the Euclid telescope and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also be
affected by field variance. We use the Uchuu simulation, a state-of-the-art
cosmological $N$-body simulation with 2.1 trillion particles in a volume of
$25.7~\mathrm{Gpc}^3$, that has sufficient mass resolution to resolve
dwarf-size systems, combined with a semi-analytic galaxy and AGN formation
model, to generate the Uchuu-$\nu^2$GC catalog, publicly available, that allows
us to investigate the field-to-field variance of the luminosity function of
AGN. With this Uchuu-$\nu^2$GC model, we quantify the cosmic variance as a
function of survey area, AGN luminosity, and redshift. In general, cosmic
variance decreases with increasing survey area and decreasing redshift. We find
that at $z\sim6-7$, the cosmic variance depends weakly on AGN luminosity, in
particular for small survey areas (0.01 and 0.1 deg$^2$). This is because the
typical mass of dark matter haloes in which AGN reside does not significantly
depend on luminosity. Due to the rarity of AGN, Poisson variance dominates the
total field-to-field variance, especially for bright AGN. We discuss
uncertainties present in the estimation of the faint-end of the AGN luminosity
function from recent observations, and extend this to make predictions for the
expected number of AGN and their variance for upcoming observations with
Euclid, JWST, and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In particular, we
predict that the Euclid deep survey will find 120--240 (16--80) AGN --
depending on the model -- with rest-frame UV absolute magnitude brighter than
$-20$ ($-20.5$) at $z=6.3$ ($z=7$) in the Euclid H-band deep survey (abridged).

server deployed close to the users and a cloud server at a greater distance

can be served at the edge with low latency. However, as the computation
resources at the edge are limited, some requests must be routed to the cloud
for service and incur high latency. The system's overall performance depends on
the rent cost incurred to use the edge server, the latency experienced by the
users, and the cost incurred to change the amount of edge computation resources
rented over time. The algorithmic challenge is to determine the amount of edge
computation power to rent over time. We propose a deterministic online policy
and characterize its performance for adversarial and stochastic i.i.d. request
arrival processes. We also characterize a fundamental bound on the performance
of any deterministic online policy. Further, we compare the performance of our

training distribution, they are more likely to make inaccurate predictions; in
a cyber-physical system (CPS), this could lead to catastrophic system failure.
To mitigate this risk, an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector can run in
parallel with an ML model and flag inputs that could lead to undesirable
outcomes. Although OOD detectors have been well studied in terms of accuracy,
there has been less focus on deployment to resource constrained CPSs. In this
study, a design methodology is proposed to tune deep OOD detectors to meet the
accuracy and response time requirements of embedded applications. The
methodology uses genetic algorithms to optimize the detector's preprocessing
pipeline and selects a quantization method that balances robustness and
response time. It also identifies several candidate task graphs under the Robot
Operating System (ROS) for deployment of the selected design. The methodology
is demonstrated on two variational autoencoder based OOD detectors from the
literature on two embedded platforms. Insights into the trade-offs that occur
during the design process are provided, and it is shown that this design
methodology can lead to a drastic reduction in response time in relation to an
unoptimized OOD detector while maintaining comparable accuracy.

of millions nodes is both resource and time consuming. Different from DNNs,
GNNs usually have larger memory footprints, and thus the GPU memory capacity

address this problem, we present BiFeat: a graph feature quantization
methodology to accelerate GNN training by significantly reducing the memory

prone to the information loss of input features caused by quantization. We
identify the main accuracy impact factors in graph feature quantization and
theoretically prove that BiFeat training converges to a network where the loss
is within $\epsilon$ of the optimal loss of uncompressed network. We perform
extensive evaluation of BiFeat using several popular GNN models and datasets,
including GraphSAGE on MAG240M, the largest public graph dataset. The results
demonstrate that BiFeat achieves a compression ratio of more than 30 and
improves GNN training speed by 200%-320% with marginal accuracy loss. In
particular, BiFeat achieves a record by training GraphSAGE on MAG240M within

AFM state to SC state in the quasi-one-dimensional AMn6Bi5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs)
compounds. We find that at a critical pressure the AFM state suddenly
disappears at a finite temperature and a SC state simultaneously emerges at a
lower temperature without detectable structural changes. Intriguingly, all
members of the family present the AFM-SC transition at almost the same critical
pressures (Pc), though their ambient-pressure unit-cell volumes vary
substantially. Our theoretical calculations indicate that the increasing weight
of dxz orbital electrons near Fermi energy under the pressure may be the origin
of the flipping. These results reveal a diversity of competing nature between

  Framework for Temporal Grounding","Accepted by ECCV2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal grounding aims to locate a target video moment that semantically
corresponds to the given sentence query in an untrimmed video. However, recent
works find that existing methods suffer a severe temporal bias problem. These
methods do not reason the target moment locations based on the visual-textual
semantic alignment but over-rely on the temporal biases of queries in training
sets. To this end, this paper proposes a novel training framework for grounding
models to use shuffled videos to address temporal bias problem without losing
grounding accuracy. Our framework introduces two auxiliary tasks, cross-modal
matching and temporal order discrimination, to promote the grounding model
training. The cross-modal matching task leverages the content consistency
between shuffled and original videos to force the grounding model to mine
visual contents to semantically match queries. The temporal order
discrimination task leverages the difference in temporal order to strengthen
the understanding of long-term temporal contexts. Extensive experiments on
Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method for mitigating the reliance on temporal biases and strengthening the
model's generalization ability against the different temporal distributions.

lifetime of Li-ion batteries, especially those with nickel-rich layered-oxide

ion-intercalation materials as a function of the degree of disorder, which
represents the density of defects in the host crystal. The model accounts for
defect core energies, long-range dipolar electrostatic forces, and
configurational entropy of the solid solution. In the case of nickel-rich
oxides, we hypothesize that nickel with a high concentration of defects is
driven into the bulk by electrostatic forces as oxidation reactions at the
solid-electrolyte interface reduce nickel and either evolve oxygen gas or
oxidize the organic electrolyte at high potentials (>4.4V vs. Li/Li+). The
model is used in battery cycling simulations to describe the extent of cathode
degradation when using different voltage cutoffs, in agreement with
experimental observations that lower-voltage cycling can substantially reduce
cathode degradation. The theory provides a framework to guide the development
of cathode compositions, coatings and electrolytes to enhance rate capability
and enhance battery lifetime. The general theory of cation-disorder formation
may also find applications in electrochemical water treatment and ion
separations, such as lithium extraction from brines, based on competitive ion
intercalation in battery materials.

(cycles 1-4), triple maximum amplitude distributions for cycles 0 and 1 and for
cycles -1 and -2 just before Maunder minimum. The MSC cycles in 1700-1750
reveal smaller maximal magnitudes in cycles -3 to 0 and in cycle 1-4 than the

SSN. Close fitting of MSC or Bayesian models to the sunspot curve distorts the
occurrences of either Maunder Minimum or/and modern grand solar minimum

difference in solar magnetic fields responsible for these proxies. The dynamo

  Passing with Parameter Estimation","Keywords: Approximate message passing, Compressive sensing, Outlier

ground-truth in clinical settings makes it challenging to determine suitable
parameters for the dipole inversion. We propose a probabilistic Bayesian
approach for QSM with built-in parameter estimation, and incorporate the
nonlinear formulation of the dipole inversion to achieve a robust recovery of
the susceptibility maps.
  Theory: From a Bayesian perspective, the image wavelet coefficients are
approximately sparse and modelled by the Laplace distribution. The measurement
noise is modelled by a Gaussian-mixture distribution with two components, where
the second component is used to model the noise outliers. Through probabilistic
inference, the susceptibility map and distribution parameters can be jointly
recovered using approximate message passing (AMP).
  Methods: We compare our proposed AMP with built-in parameter estimation
(AMP-PE) to the state-of-the-art L1-QSM, FANSI and MEDI approaches on the
simulated and in vivo datasets, and perform experiments to explore the optimal
settings of AMP-PE. Reproducible code is available at
https://github.com/EmoryCN2L/QSM_AMP_PE
  Results: On the simulated Sim2Snr1 dataset, AMP-PE achieved the lowest NRMSE,
DFCM and the highest SSIM, while MEDI achieved the lowest HFEN. On the in vivo
datasets, AMP-PE is robust and successfully recovers the susceptibility maps
using the estimated parameters, whereas L1-QSM, FANSI and MEDI typically
require additional visual fine-tuning to select or double-check working
parameters.
  Conclusion: AMP-PE provides automatic and adaptive parameter estimation for
QSM and avoids the subjectivity from the visual fine-tuning step, making it an
excellent choice for the clinical setting.

relative weight of plasmonic and photonic components in the hybrid mode, we
analyze the physical mechanism of strong diffractive coupling leading to the

plasmonic systems for sensing applications. In particular, we identify a
coupling regime where the combination of a large intrinsic circular dichroism
of the plasmonic resonance with a well-defined balance between the photonic

the system to discriminate refractive index changes in the surrounding medium.
Our results lay the foundation for exploiting circular dichroism in plasmonic

become dependent on a large number of software packages. Consequently,
developers are faced with the difficult challenge of maintaining their project
dependencies by keeping them up-to-date and free of security vulnerabilities.
However, how often are project dependencies used in production where they could
pose a threat to their project's security?
  We conduct an empirical study on 100 JavaScript projects using the Node
Package Manager (npm) to quantify how often project dependencies are released
to production and analyze their characteristics and their impact on security.
Our results indicate that less than 1% of the installed dependencies are
released to production. Our analysis reveals that the functionality of a
package is not enough to determine if it will be released to production or not.
In fact, 59% of the installed dependencies configured as runtime dependencies
are not used in production, and 28.2% of the dependencies configured as
development dependencies are used in production, debunking two common
assumptions of dependency management. Findings also indicate that most security
alerts target dependencies not used in production, making them highly unlikely
to be a risk for the security of the software. Our study unveils a more complex
side of dependency management: not all dependencies are equal. Dependencies
used in production are more sensitive to security exposure and should be

that estimators from both classes of models are inconsistent for the number of

analyses are unclear. The final reported estimate after fitting these models is
often a single representative clustering obtained using an MCMC summarisation
technique, but it is unknown how well such a summary estimates the number of

simulations and an application to gene expression data, and find that (i) DPMs
overestimate the number of clusters even in finite samples, but only to a
limited degree that may be correctable using appropriate summaries, and (ii)
misspecification can lead to considerable overestimation of the number of
clusters in both DPMs and MFMs, but results are nevertheless often still
interpretable. We provide recommendations on MCMC summarisation and suggest
that although the more appealing asymptotic properties of MFMs provide strong
motivation to prefer them, results obtained using MFMs and DPMs are often very

simulations of lattice QCD provide ample data for various Euclidean correlation
functions, the inversion required to extract spectral functions is an ill-posed
problem. In this work, we pursue previously established constraints imposed by
field locality at finite temperature $T$, namely that spectral functions
possess a non-perturbative representation which generalises the well-known
K\""{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann spectral form to $T>0$. Using this representation, we
analyse lattice QCD data of the spatial pseudo-scalar correlator in the
temperature range $220-960 \, \text{MeV}$, and obtain an analytic expression
for the corresponding spectral function, with parameters fixed by the data.
From the structure of this spectral function we find evidence for the existence
of a distinct pion state above the chiral pseudo-critical temperature
$T_{\text{pc}}$, and contributions from its first excitation, which gradually
melt as the temperature increases. As a non-trivial test, we find that the
extracted spectral function reproduces the corresponding temporal lattice

future. The research assessed in the early IPCC reports was necessarily about
potential climate policies, always stylized and often optimized. The IPCC has
continued on this path, even though there is now a considerable literature
studying actual climate policy, in all its infuriating detail, warts and all.
Four case studies suggest that the IPCC, in its current form, will not be able
to successfully switch from ex ante to ex post policy evaluation. This
transition is key as AR7 will most likely have to confront the failure to meet
the 1.5K target. The four cases are as follows. (1) The scenarios first build
and later endorsed by the IPCC all project a peaceful future with steady if not
rapid economic growth everywhere, more closely resembling political manifestos
than facts on the ground. (2) Successive IPCC reports have studiously avoided
discussing the voluminous literature suggesting that political targets for
greenhouse gas emission reduction are far from optimal, although a central part
of that work was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018. (3) IPCC AR5 found it
impossible to acknowledge that the international climate policy negotiations
from COP1 (Berlin) to COP19 (Warsaw) were bound to fail, just months before the
radical overhaul at COP20 (Lima) proved that point. (4) IPCC AR6 by and large
omitted the nascent literature on \textit{ex post} climate policy evaluation.
Together, these cases suggest that the IPCC finds self-criticism difficult and
is too close to policy makers to criticize past and current policy mistakes.
One solution would be to move control over the IPCC to the national authorities
on research and higher education.

DFT based on a metric algebroid formulation given previously in [1]. The
derivation of the general action given in this paper does not employ the
section condition. Instead, the action is determined by requiring a pre-Bianchi
identity on the structure functions of the metric algebroid and also for the
dilaton flux. The pre-Bianchi identity is also a sufficient condition for a
generalized Lichnerowicz formula to hold. The reduction to the D-dimensional
space is achieved by a dimensional reduction of the fluctuations. The result
contains the theory on the group manifold, or the theory extending to the GSE,
depending on the chosen background. As an explicit example we apply our
formulation to the Poisson-Lie T-duality in the effective theory on a group
manifold. It is formulated as a 2D-dimensional diffeomorphism including the

physiology is the control layer that separates genomes from capacities
ascertained by selection. A key aspect is competency, as cells are not a
passive material but descendants of unicellular organisms with complex
context-sensitive capabilities. We used an evolutionary simulation in the
context of minimal artificial embryogeny to probe the effects of different
degrees of cellular competency on evolutionary dynamics. Virtual embryos
consisted of a single axis of positional information values provided by cells'
genomes, operated upon by an evolutionary cycle in which embryos' fitness was
proportional to monotonicity of the axial gradient. Evolutionary dynamics were
evaluated in two modes: hardwired ""mosaic"" development (genotype directly
encodes phenotype), and a more realistic mode in which cells interact prior to
evaluation by the fitness function (""regulative"" development). Even minimal
competency with respect to improving their position in the embryo results in
better performance of the evolutionary search. Crucially, we observed that as
competency of cells masks the raw fitness of the genomes, the phenotypic
fitness gains are then mostly due to improvements of cells' developmental
problem-solving capacities, not the structural genome. This suggests the
existence of a powerful ratchet mechanism: evolution progressively becomes
locked in to improvements in the intelligence of its agential substrate, with
reduced pressure on the structural genome. A feedback loop in which evolution
increasingly puts more effort into the developmental software than perfecting
the hardware explains the very puzzling divergence of genome from anatomy in
species like planaria, identifies a possible drive for scaling intelligence
over time, and suggests strategies for engineering novel systems in silico and
in bioengineering.

the transfer of polarization from electron spins to nuclear spins using
on-resonance microwave (MW) irradiation. In most cases, monochromatic
continuous-wave (MCW) MW irradiation is used. Recently, several groups have
shown that the use of frequency modulation of the MW irradiation can result in
an additional increase in DNP enhancement above that obtained with MCW. The
effect of frequency modulation on the solid effect (SE) and the cross effect
(CE) has previously been studied using the stable organic radical 4-hydroxy
TEMPO (TEMPOL) at temperatures under 20 K. Here, in addition to the SE and CE,
we discuss the effect of frequency modulation on the Overhauser effect (OE) and
the truncated CE (tCE) in the room-temperature $^{13}$C-DNP of diamond powders.
We recently showed that diamond powders can exhibit multiple DNP mechanisms
simultaneously due to the heterogeneity of P1 (substitutional nitrogen)
environments within diamond crystallites. We explore the enhancement obtained
via the two most important parameters for frequency modulation 1) Modulation
frequency, $f_{m}$ (how fast the modulation frequency is varied) and 2)
Modulation amplitude, $\Delta\omega$ (the magnitude of the change in microwave
frequency) influence the enhancement obtained via each mechanism. Frequency
modulation during DNP not only allows us to improve DNP enhancement, but also
gives us a way to control which DNP mechanism is most active. By choosing the
appropriate modulation parameters, we can selectively enhance some mechanisms
while simultaneously suppressing others.

limited photometry for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called

such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the
Early Release Science Program CEERS. 30 HST-dark sources are selected based on
their red colours across 1.6 $\mu$m to 4.4 $\mu$m. Their physical properties
are derived from 12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST
imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-obscured
($A_{V}\sim2$ mag), massive ($\log (M/M_{\odot}) \sim10$), star-forming sources
at $z\sim2-8$ with an observed surface density of $\sim0.8$ arcmin$^{-2}$. This
suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing
from our cosmic census at $z>3$ all the way into the Reionization epoch. The
HST-dark sources lie on the main sequence of galaxies and add an obscured star
formation rate density (SFRD) of $\mathrm{3.2^{+1.8}_{-1.3} \times 10^{-3}
M_{\odot}/yr/Mpc^{3}}$ at $z\sim7$ showing likely presence of dust in the Epoch

but yet challenging topic in AI with a broad range of applications in various
areas such communication and transportation. The Weight Constrained Shortest
Path Problem (WCSPP), as the base form of constrained path finding with only
one side constraint, aims to plan a cost optimum path whose weight/resource
usage is limited. Given the bi-criteria nature of the problem (i.e., dealing
with cost and weight of paths), methods addressing the WCSPP have some common
properties with bi-objective search. This paper leverages the recent
state-of-the-art A*-based techniques in both constrained path finding and
bi-objective search and presents two exact solution approaches to the WCSPP,
both capable of solving hard problem instances on very large graphs. We
empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithms on a new set of large
and realistic problem instances and show their advantages over the
state-of-the-art algorithms in both time and space metrics. This paper also
investigates the importance of priority queues in constrained search with A*.
We show with extensive experiments on both realistic and randomised graphs how
bucket-based queues without tie-breaking can effectively improve the
algorithmic performance of exhaustive bi-criteria searches.

stimulated by the multi-messenger observation of the gravitational event
GW170817, with the detection of both gravitational waves and electromagnetic
waves corresponding to the merger of two neutron stars. Such phenomenon has
been proposed as one of the main sources of the \emph{r}-process. However, the
origin of the \emph{r}-process elements at different metallicities is still
under debate. We aim at investigating the origin of the \emph{r}-process
elements in the Galactic thin disc population. From the sixth internal data
release of the \emph{Gaia}-ESO we have collected a large sample of Milky Way
thin- and thick-disc stars for which abundances of Eu, O, and Mg are available.
The sample consists of members of 62 open clusters, located at a Galactocentric
radius from $\sim 5$ kpc to $\sim 20$ kpc in the disc, in the metallicity range
$[-0.5, 0.4]$ and covering an age interval from 0.1 to 7 Gy, and about 1300
Milky Way disc field stars in the metallicity range $[-1.5, 0.5]$. We compare
the observations with the results of a chemical evolution model, in which we
varied the nucleosynthesis sources for the three considered elements. Our main
result is that Eu in the thin disc is predominantly produced by sources with
short lifetimes, such as magneto-rotationally driven SNe. There is no strong
evidence for additional sources at delayed times. Our findings do not imply
that there cannot be a contribution from mergers of neutron stars in other
environments, as in the halo or in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but such a
contribution is not needed to explain Eu abundances at thin disc metallicities.

6, 2020 to September 25, 2021. Because cities are embedded in rather complex
transportation networks, we construct the spatio-temporal dynamic graph model,
in which the graph attention neural network is utilized as a deep learning
method to learn the pandemic transition probability among major cities in
Massachusetts. Using the spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT), we process
the COVID-19 data on the dynamic graph, which enables us to design effective
tools to analyze and detect spatio-temporal patterns in the pandemic spreading.
We design a new node classification method, which effectively identifies the
anomaly cities based on spectral graph wavelet coefficients. It can assist
administrations or public health organizations in monitoring the spread of the
pandemic and developing preventive measures. Unlike most work focusing on the
evolution of confirmed cases over time, we focus on the spatio-temporal
patterns of pandemic evolution among cities. Through the data analysis and
visualization, a better understanding of the epidemiological development at the
city level is obtained and can be helpful with city-specific surveillance.

table-top realization of the analog of exotic quantum gravity scenarios, which
are speculated to lead to certain generalized Heisenberg algebras. In
particular, we identify three different energy regimes (the ``layers'') where
the physics is still of a pseudorelativistic (Dirac) type but more and more
sensitive to the effects of the lattice. This plays here a role analog to that
of a discrete space, where the Dirac quasiparticles live. This work improves
and pushes further earlier results, where the physical meaning of the high
energy momenta was clear, but the conjugate coordinates only had a purely
abstract description. Here we find the physical meaning of the latter by
identifying the mapping between the high-energy coordinates and low-energy
ones, i.e., those measured in the lab. We then obtain two generalized
Heisenberg algebras that were not noticed earlier. In these two cases, we have
the striking result that the high-energy coordinates just coincide with the
standard ones, measured in the lab. A third generalized Heisenberg algebra is
obtained, and it is an improvement of the results obtained earlier in two
respects: we now have an expression of the generalized coordinates in terms of
the standard phase-space variables, and we obtain higher order terms. All
mentioned results clearly open the doors to table-top experimental
verifications of many generalized uncertainty principle-corrected predictions
of the quantum gravity phenomenology.

multivariate extremes. In high dimensions, however, the construction of
flexible and parsimonious models is challenging. We propose to combine
bivariate extreme value distributions into a Markov random field with respect
to a tree. Although in general not an extreme value distribution itself, this
Markov tree is attracted by a multivariate extreme value distribution. The
latter serves as a tree-based approximation to an unknown extreme value
distribution with the given bivariate distributions as margins. Given data, we
learn an appropriate tree structure by Prim's algorithm with estimated pairwise
upper tail dependence coefficients or Kendall's tau values as edge weights. The
distributions of pairs of connected variables can be fitted in various ways.
The resulting tree-structured extreme value distribution allows for inference
on rare event probabilities, as illustrated on river discharge data from the
upper Danube basin.

a given material is an ongoing research area in the paradigm of
Materials-by-Design. Historically, microstructural analysis mostly relies on
qualitative descriptions. However, to build a robust and accurate
process-structure-properties relationship, which is required for designing new
advanced high-performance materials, the extraction of quantitative and
meaningful statistical data from the microstructural analysis is a critical
step. In recent years, computer vision (CV) methods, especially those which are
centered around convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms have shown
promising results for this purpose. This review paper focuses on the
state-of-the-art CNN-based techniques that have been applied to various
multi-scale microstructural image analysis tasks, including classification,
object detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and reconstruction.
Additionally, we identified the main challenges with regard to the application
of these methods to materials science research. Finally, we discussed some
possible future directions of research in this area. In particular, we
emphasized the application of transformer-based models and their capabilities
to improve the microstructural analysis of materials.

a worldwide struggle to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many countries worldwide decided to impose local
lockdowns in order to reduce person-to-person interactions, masks became
obligatory especially in closed spaces, and there was a general requirement for
social distance. However, the most efficient method to reduce continuing
spreading of infection among the population, and in the meantime maintain a
regular daily life, is early detection of infected contagious people. Up to
now, the most reliable method for SARS-CoV-2 detection is reverse-transcriptase
PCR test (RT-PCR). It is possible to detect the virus even if there is only one
RNA strand in the sample, and run hundreds of samples simultaneously. This
method has a few disadvantages, such as high cost, is time consuming, the need
for medical laboratories and skilled staff to perform the test, and the major
flaw: the lack of appropriate number of available tests. The latterly prominent
Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) and its derivatives have caused a tremendous
increase in the number of infected people due to its enhanced transmissibility.
This all emphasizes the high demand for easy-to-use, cheap and available
detection tests.

Our algorithm is also capable of learning from long-term and sparse reward
signals with varying delay. Empirical results from the simulation of a V2X
application confirm that through learning, agents with the learning algorithm
significantly improve both system and individual performance, reducing up to
30% of offloading failure rate, communication overhead and load variation,
increasing computation resource utilization and fairness. Results also confirm
the algorithm's good convergence and generalization property in different
environments.

measurements using flame emission spectroscopy (FES). Particularly, the
short-gated fast FES is essential to resolve fast-evolving combustion

spectrum gets shorter, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases, and
characteristic spectral features indicating the gas properties become
relatively weaker. Then, the property estimation based on the short-gated
spectrum is difficult and inaccurate. Denoising convolutional neural networks
(CNN) can enhance the SNR of the short-gated spectrum. A new CNN architecture
including a reversible down- and up-sampling (DU) operator and a loss function
based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) coefficients is proposed. For
training and testing the CNN, flame chemiluminescence spectra were captured
from a stable methane-air flat flame using a portable spectrometer (spectral
range: 250 - 850 nm, resolution: 0.5 nm) with varied equivalence ratio (0.8 -
1.2), pressure (1 - 10 bar), and exposure time (0.05, 0.2, 0.4, and 2 s). The
long exposure (2 s) spectra were used as the ground truth when training the
denoising CNN. A kriging model with POD is trained by the long-gated spectra
for calibration, and then the prediction of the gas properties taking the
denoised short-gated spectrum as the input: The property prediction errors of
pressure and equivalence ratio were remarkably lowered in spite of the low SNR
attendant with reduced exposure.
