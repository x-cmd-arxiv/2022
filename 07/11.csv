equations (SDEs) is computationally challenging. A new forward propagation
algorithm has been recently proposed for the online optimization of SDEs. The
algorithm solves an SDE, derived using forward differentiation, which provides
a stochastic estimate for the gradient. The algorithm continuously updates the
SDE model's parameters and the gradient estimate simultaneously. This paper
studies the convergence of the forward propagation algorithm for nonlinear
dissipative SDEs. We leverage the ergodicity of this class of nonlinear SDEs to
characterize the convergence rate of the transition semi-group and its
derivatives. Then, we prove bounds on the solution of a Poisson partial
differential equation (PDE) for the expected time integral of the algorithm's
stochastic fluctuations around the direction of steepest descent. We then
re-write the algorithm using the PDE solution, which allows us to characterize
the parameter evolution around the direction of steepest descent. Our main
result is a convergence theorem for the forward propagation algorithm for
nonlinear dissipative SDEs.

real-world applications, deep neural networks (DNNs) can be backdoored: by
injecting triggered data samples into the training dataset, the adversary can
mislead the trained model into classifying any test data to the target class as
long as the trigger pattern is presented. To nullify such backdoor threats,
various methods have been proposed. Particularly, a line of research aims to
purify the potentially compromised model. However, one major limitation of this
line of work is the requirement to access sufficient original training data:
the purifying performance is a lot worse when the available training data is
limited. In this work, we propose Adversarial Weight Masking (AWM), a novel
method capable of erasing the neural backdoors even in the one-shot setting.
The key idea behind our method is to formulate this into a min-max optimization
problem: first, adversarially recover the trigger patterns and then (soft) mask
the network weights that are sensitive to the recovered patterns. Comprehensive
evaluations of several benchmark datasets suggest that AWM can largely improve
the purifying effects over other state-of-the-art methods on various available
training dataset sizes.

scheme with replicated sensing task allocation. Although replicated task
allocation may sound counter-intuitive, it can actually foster cooperative
transmission among multiple UAVs and thus reduce the overall sensing mission
completion time. To obtain the optimal task allocation and transmit power of
the proposed scheme, a mission completion time minimization problem is
formulated. To solve this problem, a necessary condition for replicated sensing
task allocation is derived. For the cases of replicated sensing, the considered
problem is transformed into a monotonic optimization and is solved by the
generic Polyblock algorithm. To efficiently evaluate the mission completion
time in each iteration of the Polyblock algorithm, new auxiliary variables are
introduced to decouple the otherwise sophisticated joint optimization of
transmission time and power. While for the degenerated case of non-replicated

networks with optimised traffic routing. In particular, we study the behaviour
of total travel time, and consider both self-interested routing paradigms, such
as User Equilibrium (UE) routing, as well as cooperative paradigms, such as
classic Multi-Commodity (MC) network flow and System Optimal (SO) routing. We
provide a formal framework for designing transport networks through iterative
path additions, introducing the concepts of trip spanning tree and trip path
graph. Using this formalisation, we prove multiple properties of the objective
function for transport network design. Since the underlying routing problem is
NP-Hard, we investigate properties that provide guarantees in approximate
algorithm design. Firstly, while Braess' paradox has shown that total travel
time is not monotonic non-increasing with respect to path additions under
self-interested routing (UE), we prove that, instead, monotonicity holds for
cooperative routing (MC and SO). This result has the important implication that
cooperative agents make the best use of redundant infrastructure. Secondly, we
prove via a counterexample that the intuitive statement `adding a path to a
transport network always grants greater or equal benefit to users than adding
it to a superset of that network' is false. In other words we prove that, for
all the routing formulations studied, total travel time is not supermodular
with respect to path additions. While this counter-intuitive result yields a
hardness property for algorithm design, we provide particular instances where,
instead, the property of supermodularity holds. Our study on monotonicity and
supermodularity of total travel time with respect to path additions provides
formal proofs and scenarios that constitute important insights for transport

produces several annual meteor showers on Earth. If the linkage between these
showers and 2P/Encke is at the centre of most TMC models, the small size and
low activity of the comet suggest that 2P/Encke is not the unique parent body
of the Taurids. Here we simulate the formation of the TMC from 2P/Encke and
several NEAs. In total, we explored more than a hundred stream formation
scenarios using clones of 2P/Encke. Each modelled stream was integrated and
compared with present-day Taurid observations. As previously reported, we find
that even slight variations of 2P/Encke's orbit modifies considerably the
characteristics of the simulated showers. Most of the comet's clones, including
the nominal one, appear to reproduce the radiant structure of the Taurid
meteors but do not match the observed time and duration of the showers.
However, the radiants and timing of most Taurid showers are well reproduced by
a particular clone of the comet. Our analysis thus suggest that with this
specific dynamical history, 2P/Encke is the sole parent of the four major TMC
showers which have ages from 7-21 ka. Our modelling also predicts that the 2022
Taurid Resonant Swarm return will be comparable in strength to the 1998, 2005
and 2015 returns. While purely dynamical models of Encke's orbit -- limited by
chaos -- may fail to reveal the comet's origin, its meteor showers may provide
the trail of breadcrumbs needed to backtrack our way out of the labyrinth.

is a set of additional edges $H \subseteq V \times V$ such that $G \cup H$ has
the same transitive closure as $G$, and for every pair $u,v \in V$, there is a
$uv$-path in $G \cup H$ with at most $\beta$ edges. A natural generalization of
shortcut sets to distances is a $(\beta,\epsilon)$-\emph{hopset} $H \subseteq V
\times V$, where the requirement is that $H$ and $G \cup H$ have the same
shortest-path distances, and for every $u,v \in V$, there is a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest path in $G \cup H$ with at most $\beta$
edges.
  There is a large literature on the tradeoff between the size of a shortcut
set / hopset and the value of $\beta$. We highlight the most natural point on
this tradeoff: what is the minimum value of $\beta$, such that for any graph
$G$, there exists a $\beta$-shortcut set (or a $(\beta,\epsilon)$-hopset) with
$O(n)$ edges? Not only is this a natural structural question in its own right,
but shortcuts sets / hopsets form the core of many distributed, parallel, and
dynamic algorithms for reachability / shortest paths. Until very recently the
best known upper bound was a folklore construction showing $\beta =
O(n^{1/2})$, but in a breakthrough result Kogan and Parter [SODA 2022] improve
this to $\beta = \tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ for shortcut sets and $\tilde{O}(n^{2/5})$
for hopsets.
  Our result is to close the gap between shortcut sets and hopsets. That is, we
show that for any graph $G$ and any fixed $\epsilon$ there is a
$(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}),\epsilon)$ hopset with $O(n)$ edges. More generally, we
achieve a smooth tradeoff between hopset size and $\beta$ which exactly matches
the tradeoff of Kogan and Parter for shortcut sets (up to polylog factors).
  Using a very recent black-box reduction of Kogan and Parter, our new hopset
implies improved bounds for approximate distance preservers.

hard combinatorial problem that has been well-studied for various classes of
graphs. When it comes to random graphs, only the classical binomial random
graph $G_{n,p}$ has been analysed and shown to have largest independent sets of
size $\Theta(\log{n})$ w.h.p. This classical model does not capture any
dependency structure between edges that can appear in real-world networks. We
initiate study in this direction by defining random graphs $G^{r}_{n,p}$ whose
existence of edges is determined by a Markov process that is also governed by a
decay parameter $r\in(0,1]$. We prove that w.h.p. $G^{r}_{n,p}$ has independent
sets of size $(\frac{1-r}{2+\epsilon}) \frac{n}{\log{n}}$ for arbitrary
$\epsilon > 0$, which implies an asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(\pi(n))$
where $\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function. This is derived using bounds on
the terms of a harmonic series, Tur\'an bound on stability number, and a
concentration analysis for a certain sequence of dependent Bernoulli variables
that may also be of independent interest. Since $G^{r}_{n,p}$ collapses to
$G_{n,p}$ when there is no decay, it follows that having even the slightest bit
of dependency (any $r < 1$) in the random graph construction leads to the
presence of large independent sets and thus our random model has a phase
transition at its boundary value of $r=1$. For the maximal independent set
output by a greedy algorithm, we deduce that it has a performance ratio of at
most $1 + \frac{\log{n}}{(1-r)}$ w.h.p. when the lowest degree vertex is picked

sources would provide smoking gun evidence for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray
production. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse astrophysical
neutrino flux in 2013 and observed the first compelling evidence for a

IceCube and other neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we
present results from an expedition to the north-eastern region of the South
China Sea. A favorable neutrino telescope site was found on an abyssal plain at
a depth of $\sim$ 3.5 km. Below 3 km, the sea current speed was measured to be
$v_{\mathrm{c}}<$ 10 cm/s, with absorption and scattering lengths for Cherenkov

(CG) methods for solving vehicle routing problems. We introduce Local Area (LA)
route relaxations, an alternative/complement to the commonly used ng-route
relaxations and Decremental State Space Relaxations (DSSR) inside of CG
formulations. LA routes are a subset of ng-routes and a super-set of elementary
routes. Normally, the pricing stage of CG must produce elementary routes, which
are routes without repeated customers, using processes which can be
computationally expensive. Non-elementary routes visit at least one customer
more than once, creating a cycle. LA routes relax the constraint of being an
elementary route in such a manner as to permit efficient pricing. LA routes are
best understood in terms of ng-route relaxations. Ng-routes are routes which
are permitted to have non-localized cycles in space; this means that at least
one intermediate customer (called a breaker) in the cycle must consider the
starting customer in the cycle to be spatially far away. LA routes are
described using a set of special indexes corresponding to customers on the
route ordered from the start to the end of the route. LA route relaxations
further restrict the set of permitted cycles beyond that of ng-routes by
additionally enforcing that the breaker must be a located at a special index
where the set of special indexes is defined recursively as follows. The first
special index in the route is at index 1 meaning that it is associated with the
first customer in the route. The k'th special index corresponds to the first
customer after the k-1'th special index, that is not considered to be a
neighbor of (considered spatially far from) the customer located at the k-1'th
special index. We demonstrate that LA route relaxations can significantly
improve the computational speed of pricing when compared to the standard DSSR.

looking multimedia cover object. This embedding introduces some distortion to
the cover object and produces a corresponding stego object. The embedding
distortion is measured by a cost function that determines the detection
probability of the existence of the embedded secret data. A cost function
related to the maximum embedding rate is typically employed to evaluate a
steganographic system. In addition, the distribution of multimedia sources
follows the Gibbs distribution which is a complex statistical model that
restricts analysis. Thus, previous multimedia steganographic approaches either
assume a relaxed distribution or presume a proposition on the maximum embedding
rate and then try to prove it is correct. Conversely, this paper introduces an
analytic approach to determining the maximum embedding rate in multimedia cover
objects through a constrained optimization problem concerning the relationship
between the maximum embedding rate and the probability of detection by any
steganographic detector. The KL-divergence between the distributions for the
cover and stego objects is used as the cost function as it upper bounds the
performance of the optimal steganographic detector. An equivalence between the
Gibbs and correlated-multivariate-quantized-Gaussian distributions is
established to solve this optimization problem. The solution provides an
analytic form for the maximum embedding rate in terms of the WrightOmega
function. Moreover, it is proven that the maximum embedding rate is in
agreement with the commonly used Square Root Law (SRL) for steganography, but
the solution presented here is more accurate. Finally, the theoretical results
obtained are verified experimentally.

achieves channel capacity, but also does so at a faster speed of convergence
than any other technique. This speed is measured by the ""scaling exponent"" and
its importance is three-fold. Firstly, estimating the scaling exponent is
challenging and demands a deeper understanding of the dynamics of communication
channels. Secondly, scaling exponents serve as a benchmark for different
variants of polar codes that helps us select the proper variant for real-life
applications. Thirdly, the need to optimize for the scaling exponent sheds
light on how to reinforce the design of polar code.
  In this paper, we generalize the binary erasure channel (BEC), the simplest
communication channel and the protagonist of many polar code studies, to the
""tetrahedral erasure channel"" (TEC). We then invoke Mori--Tanaka's $2 \times 2$
matrix over GF$(4)$ to construct polar codes over TEC. Our main contribution is
showing that the dynamic of TECs converges to an almost--one-parameter family
of channels, which then leads to an upper bound of $3.328$ on the scaling
exponent. This is the first non-binary matrix whose scaling exponent is
upper-bounded. It also polarizes BEC faster than all known binary matrices up
to $23 \times 23$ in size. Our result indicates that expanding the alphabet is
a more effective and practical alternative to enlarging the matrix in order to
achieve faster polarization.

numerically that the presence of the confining potential leads to wider domains
of stability over the parameter space compared to the unconfined case. Our
analysis suggests the existence of a stable regime of solutions for all
$\kappa$ as long as their mass is less than a critical value
$M^{\ast}(\kappa)$. Furthermore, we find that there are two different critical
masses, one corresponding to width perturbations and the other one to
translational perturbations. The results of Derrick's theorem are also obtained
by studying the small amplitude regime of a four-parameter collective
coordinate (4CC) approximation. A numerical stability analysis of the NLSE
shows that the instability curve $M^{\ast}(\kappa)$ vs. $\kappa$ lies below the
two curves found by Derrick's theorem and the 4CC approximation. In the absence
of the external potential, $\kappa=1$ demarcates the separation between the
blowup regime and the stable regime. In this 4CC approximation, for $\kappa<1$,
when the mass is above the critical mass for the translational instability,
quite complicated motions of the collective coordinates are possible. Energy
conservation prevents the blowup of the solution as well as confines the center

no universal suppression or enhancement of fluctuations.

radial metallicity gradient of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R $\sim -0.078 \pm 0.001$
dex/kpc in the plane of the disk and a vertical metallicity gradient of
$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$Z $\sim -0.15 \pm 0.01$ dex/kpc in the solar

height while the vertical gradient becomes shallower with increasing

knowledge is the core goal of the continual learning (CL) research field.
Unfortunately, training a model on new data usually compromises the performance
on past data. In the CL literature, this effect is referred to as catastrophic
forgetting (CF). CF has been largely studied, and a plethora of methods have
been proposed to address it on short sequences of non-overlapping tasks. In
such setups, CF always leads to a quick and significant drop in performance in
past tasks. Nevertheless, despite CF, recent work showed that SGD training on
linear models accumulates knowledge in a CL regression setup. This phenomenon
becomes especially visible when tasks reoccur. We might then wonder if DNNs
trained with SGD or any standard gradient-based optimization accumulate
knowledge in such a way. Such phenomena would have interesting consequences for
applying DNNs to real continual scenarios. Indeed, standard gradient-based
optimization methods are significantly less computationally expensive than
existing CL algorithms. In this paper, we study the progressive knowledge
accumulation (KA) in DNNs trained with gradient-based algorithms in long
sequences of tasks with data re-occurrence. We propose a new framework, SCoLe
(Scaling Continual Learning), to investigate KA and discover that catastrophic
forgetting has a limited effect on DNNs trained with SGD. When trained on long
sequences with data sparsely re-occurring, the overall accuracy improves, which
might be counter-intuitive given the CF phenomenon. We empirically investigate
KA in DNNs under various data occurrence frequencies and propose simple and
scalable strategies to increase knowledge accumulation in DNNs.

$L$ over a planning horizon $T$. Supply is uncertain, and is a function of the
order quantity (due to random yield/capacity, etc). We aim to minimize the
$T$-period cost, a problem that is known to be computationally intractable even
under known distributions of demand and supply. In this paper, we assume that
both the demand and supply distributions are unknown and develop a
computationally efficient online learning algorithm. We show that our algorithm
achieves a regret (i.e. the performance gap between the cost of our algorithm
and that of an optimal policy over $T$ periods) of $O(L+\sqrt{T})$ when
$L\geq\log(T)$. We do so by 1) showing our algorithm cost is higher by at most
$O(L+\sqrt{T})$ for any $L\geq 0$ compared to an optimal constant-order policy
under complete information (a well-known and widely-used algorithm) and 2)
leveraging its known performance guarantee from the existing literature. To the
best of our knowledge, a finite-sample $O(\sqrt{T})$ (and polynomial in $L$)
regret bound when benchmarked against an optimal policy is not known before in
the online inventory control literature. A key challenge in this learning
problem is that both demand and supply data can be censored; hence only
truncated values are observable. We circumvent this challenge by showing that
the data generated under an order quantity $q^2$ allows us to simulate the
performance of not only $q^2$ but also $q^1$ for all $q^1<q^2$, a key
observation to obtain sufficient information even under data censoring. By
establishing a high probability coupling argument, we are able to evaluate and
compare the performance of different order policies at their steady state
within a finite time horizon. Since the problem lacks convexity, we develop an

Following Thuan et al. (2004), we identify the sources of X-ray emission as
massive X-ray binaries containing a massive accreting stellar black hole. We
further find that the lower the metallicity, the higher the probability of
strong X-irradiation. Following Heger et al. (2003), we suggest that these
accreting black holes are produced by direct collapse of stars having initial
masses greater than $\sim50\, M_\odot$. Our models of young star clusters with
an embedded stellar black hole produce effects on the surrounding gaseous
medium that are consistent with the observed spectra. We conclude that
primitive galaxies are qualitatively different from more metal-rich galaxies in
showing evidence of hard radiation that can best be explained by the presence
of one or more embedded stellar black holes.

systems can be optimised to reproduce experimentally determined structural and
thermodynamic properties. In contrast, experimental knowledge about the rates
of interconversion between metastable states in such systems, is hardly ever
incorporated in a force field, due to a lack of an efficient approach. Here, we
introduce such a framework, based on the relationship between dynamical
observables such as rate constants, and the underlying force field parameters,
using the statistical mechanics of trajectories. Given a prior ensemble of
molecular trajectories produced with imperfect force field parameters, the
approach allows the optimal adaption of these parameters, such that the imposed
constraint of equal predicted and experimental rate constant is obeyed. To do
so, the method combines the continuum path ensemble Maximum Caliber approach
with path reweighting methods for stochastic dynamics. When multiple solutions
are found, the method selects automatically the combination that corresponds to
the smallest perturbation of the entire path ensemble, as required by the
Maximum Entropy principle. To show the validity of the approach we illustrate
the method on simple test systems undergoing rare event dynamics. Next to
simple 2D potentials we explore particle models representing molecular
isomerisation reactions as well as protein-ligand unbinding. Besides optimal
interaction parameters the methodology gives physical insight into what parts
of the model are most sensitive to the kinetics. We discuss the generality and

$S\subseteq V$ such that every vertex $v\in V\setminus S$ has at least one
neighbor in $S$. Finding a dominating set with the minimum cardinality in a
connected graph $G=(V,E)$ is known to be NP-hard. A polynomial-time
approximation algorithm for this problem, described here, works in two stages.
At the first stage a dominant set is generated by a greedy algorithm, and at
the second stage this dominating set is purified (reduced). The reduction is
achieved by the analysis of the flowchart of the algorithm of the first stage
and a special kind of clustering of the dominating set generated at the first
stage. The clustering of the dominating set naturally leads to a special kind
of a spanning forest of graph $G$, which serves as a basis for the second
purification stage. We expose some types of graphs for which the algorithm of
the first stage already delivers an optimal solution and derive sufficient
conditions when the overall algorithm constructs an optimal solution. We give
three alternative approximation ratios for the algorithm of the first stage,
two of which are expressed in terms of solely invariant problem instance
parameters, and we also give one additional approximation ratio for the overall
two-stage algorithm. The greedy algorithm of the first stage turned out to be
essentially the same as the earlier known state-of-the-art algorithms for the
set cover and dominating set problem Chv\'atal \cite{chvatal} and Parekh
\cite{parekh}. The second purification stage results in a significant reduction
of the dominant set created at the first stage, in practice. The practical
behavior of both stages was verified for randomly generated problem instances.

by the trivial line bundle and with the extension class c_1(T_X) on
Picard-rank-1 Fano varieties. In cases where the index divides the dimension or
the dimension plus one, we show that stability of the tangent bundle implies
(semi)stability of the canonical extension. One consequence of our result is
that the canonical extensions on moduli spaces of stable vector bundles with a
fixed determinant on a curve are at least semistable, and stable in some cases.

brain MRIs. The framework starts with a data augmentation method called
Brain-Aware Replacements (BAR), which leverages a standard brain parcellation
to replace medically-relevant 3D brain regions in an anchor MRI from a randomly
picked MRI to create synthetic samples. Ground truth ""hard"" labels are also
linearly mixed depending on the replacement ratio in order to create ""soft""
labels. BAR produces a great variety of realistic-looking synthetic MRIs with
higher local variability compared to other mix-based methods, such as CutMix.
On top of BAR, we propose using a soft-label-capable supervised contrastive
loss, aiming to learn the relative similarity of representations that reflect
how mixed are the synthetic MRIs using our soft labels. This way, we do not
fully exhaust the entropic capacity of our hard labels, since we only use them
to create soft labels and synthetic MRIs through BAR. We show that a model
pre-trained using our framework can be further fine-tuned with a cross-entropy
loss using the hard labels that were used to create the synthetic samples. We
validated the performance of our framework in a binary AD detection task
against both from-scratch supervised training and state-of-the-art
self-supervised training plus fine-tuning approaches. Then we evaluated BAR's
individual performance compared to another mix-based method CutMix by
integrating it within our framework. We show that our framework yields superior
results in both precision and recall for the AD detection task.

closely related to magnetic flux emergence. It is thought that the eruption is
triggered by magnetic reconnection between the filament and the emerging flux.
However, the details of such a reconnection are rarely presented. In this
study, we report the detailed reconnection between a filament and its nearby
emerging fields, that led to the reconfiguration and subsequent partial
eruption of the filament located over the polarity inversion line of active
region 12816. Before the reconnection, we observed repeated brightenings in the
filament at a location that overlies a site of magnetic flux cancellation.
Plasmoids form at this brightening region, and propagate bi-directionally along
the filament. These indicate the tether-cutting reconnection that results in
the formation and eruption of a flux rope. To the northwest of the filament,
magnetic fields emerge, and reconnect with the context ones, resulting in
repeated jets. Afterwards, another magnetic fields emerge near the northwestern
filament endpoints, and reconnect with the filament, forming the newly
reconnected filament and loops. Current sheet repeatedly occurs at the
interface, with the mean temperature and emission measure of 1.7 MK and
1.1$\times$10$^{28}$ cm$^{-5}$. Plasmoids form in the current sheet, and
propagate along it and further along the newly reconnected filament and loops.
The newly reconnected filament then erupts, while the unreconnected filament
remains stable. We propose that besides the orientation of emerging fields,
some other parameters, such as the position, distance, strength, and area, are
also crucial for triggering the filament eruption.

reliant on the quality of the training data, and can be highly sensitive to

that should be used when approaching a new problem and, hence, measuring the

we therefore propose a new criterion to measure the robustness of various

extensive experiments on five bench mark fairness data sets using three of the
most popular fairness strategies with respect to four of the most popular
definitions of fairness. Our experiments empirically show that fairness methods
that rely on threshold optimisation are very sensitive to noise in all the

contrast to the other two methods, which are less fair for low noise scenarios
but fairer for high noise ones. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to quantitatively evaluate the robustness of fairness optimisation strategies.
This can potentially can serve as a guideline in choosing the most suitable

adaptation (GDA) is one promising way to mitigate such an issue, by leveraging
additional unlabeled data that gradually shift from the source to the target.
Through sequentially adapting the model along the ""indexed"" intermediate
domains, GDA substantially improves the overall adaptation performance. In
practice, however, the extra unlabeled data may not be separated into
intermediate domains and indexed properly, limiting the applicability of GDA.
In this paper, we investigate how to discover the sequence of intermediate
domains when it is not already available. Concretely, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework, which starts with a coarse domain discovery step via
progressive domain discriminator training. This coarse domain sequence then
undergoes a fine indexing step via a novel cycle-consistency loss, which
encourages the next intermediate domain to preserve sufficient discriminative
knowledge of the current intermediate domain. The resulting domain sequence can
then be used by a GDA algorithm. On benchmark data sets of GDA, we show that
our approach, which we name Intermediate DOmain Labeler (IDOL), can lead to
comparable or even better adaptation performance compared to the pre-defined

space-borne GW observatories, such as LISA, TianQin. And there is a linear
relation between the donor mass and gravitational wave frequency during mass
transfer phase. In our calculation, all binaries can have dynamically stable
mass transfer, which is very different from previous studies. The threshold
donor mass of Eddington-limited mass transfer for a given accretor WD mass is
lower than previous studies. Assuming that a binary may enter common envelope
if the mass transfer rate exceeds the maximum stable burning rate of He, we
provide a new criterion for double WDs surviving mass transfer, which is below
the threshold of Eddington-limit. Finally, we find that some systems with ONe
WDs in our calculation may evolve into detached binaries consisting of neutron
stars (NSs) and extremely low mass He WDs and further ultra-compact X-ray
binaries.

teleportation that operates without a final unitary correction. However, its
behavior for higher-dimensional systems has been hard to calculate explicitly
beyond dimension $d=2$. Indeed, relying on conventional Hilbert-space
representations entails an exponential overhead with increasing dimension. Some
general upper and lower bounds for various success measures, such as
(entanglement) fidelity, are known, but some become trivial in higher
dimensions. Here we construct a graph-theoretic algebra (a subset of
Temperley-Lieb algebra) which allows us to explicitly compute the
higher-dimensional performance of PBT for so-called ""pretty-good measurements""
with negligible representational overhead. This graphical algebra allows us to
explicitly compute the success probability to distinguish the different
outcomes and fidelity for arbitrary dimension $d$ and low number of ports $N$,
obtaining in addition a simple upper bound. The results for low $N$ and
arbitrary $d$ show that the fidelity asymptotically approaches ${N}/{d^2}$ for
large $d$, confirming the performance of one lower bound from the literature.

reflection plays a significant role in channel propagation. In this letter, the
reflection coefficient of the THz channel is researched based on extensive

320 GHz with the incident angle ranging from 10{\deg} to 80{\deg}. Based on the
measured propagation loss, the reflection coefficients of five building

frequency-angle two-dimensional reflection coefficient model by modifying the

them particularly robust to the pulse amplitude error due to the intrinsic
global property. However, in many systems, such as the silicon-based spin
qubits, the off-resonance error is the dominant noise, which can cause
dephasing and is always difficult to deal with for a geometric gate. Thus how
to deal with the off-resonance error is very significant for the application of
the geometric gates. A recent work in \emph{Phy. Rev. Appl. 16, 044005 (2021)}
reveals that by inserting two $\pi$-pulse dynamically corrected sequences into
the evolution paths, the holonomic quantum gate is effective to suppress the
pulse amplitude error, however it is still useless for combating the
off-resonance error. Inspired by this work, we combine using the techniques of
dynamical correction and path design. Surprisingly, we find that by picking up
a specific evolution path inserted by only a $\pi$-pulse dynamically corrected
sequence, the obtained optimized geometric gate is robust to the off-resonance
error, assuming the noise is static. Further, by calculating the filter
function considering the realistic $1/f$-type noise in silicon, the related
results show that the performance of the optimized geometric gate can also
surpass both the conventional geometric gate and the naive dynamical gate
constructed without using the geometric phase. Our results indicate dynamical

two main steps, first by showing how DIF can be re-formulated as a problem of
outlier detection in IRT-based scaling, then tackling the latter using
established methods from robust statistics. The proposal is a redescending
M-estimator of IRT scaling parameters that is tuned to flag items with DIF at
the desired asymptotic Type I Error rate. One way of quantifying the robustness
of the estimator is in terms of its finite sample breakdown point, which is
shown to equal to 1/2 (i.e., the estimator remains bounded whenever fewer than
1/2 of the items on an assessment exhibit DIF). This theoretical result is
complemented by simulation studies that illustrate the performance of the
estimator and its associated test of DIF. The simulation studies show that the
proposed method compares favorably to currently available approaches, and a
real data example illustrates its application in a research context where
pre-specification of anchor items is infeasible. The focus of the paper is the
two-parameter logistic model in two independent groups, with extensions to

integrating Lloyd's algorithm and low-rank approximation. Once
well-initialized, the algorithm converges fast and achieves an exponential-type
clustering error rate that is minimax optimal. Meanwhile, we show that a
tensor-based spectral method delivers a good initial clustering. Comparable to
GMM, the minimax optimal clustering error rate is decided by the separation
strength, i.e., the minimal distance between population center matrices. By
exploiting low-rankness, the proposed algorithm is blessed with a weaker
requirement on the separation strength. Unlike GMM, however, the computational
difficulty of LrMM is characterized by the signal strength, i.e., the smallest
non-zero singular values of population center matrices. Evidence is provided
showing that no polynomial-time algorithm is consistent if the signal strength
is not strong enough, even though the separation strength is strong. Intriguing
differences between estimation and clustering under LrMM are discussed. The
merits of low-rank Lloyd's algorithm are confirmed by comprehensive simulation

addressing challenges related to interpretability, such as accounting for the
effect of confounding variables (or metadata). Confounding variables affect the
relationship between input training data and target outputs. When we train a
model on such data, confounding variables will bias the distribution of the
learned features. A recent promising solution, MetaData Normalization (MDN),
estimates the linear relationship between the metadata and each feature based
on a non-trainable closed-form solution. However, this estimation is confined
by the sample size of a mini-batch and thereby may cause the approach to be
unstable during training. In this paper, we extend the MDN method by applying a
Penalty approach (referred to as PDMN). We cast the problem into a bi-level
nested optimization problem. We then approximate this optimization problem
using a penalty method so that the linear parameters within the MDN layer are
trainable and learned on all samples. This enables PMDN to be plugged into any
architectures, even those unfit to run batch-level operations, such as
transformers and recurrent models. We show improvement in model accuracy and
greater independence from confounders using PMDN over MDN in a synthetic

first study the basic symmetries associated with various learning algorithms
(M, I), focusing on four prototypical architectures in deep learning:
fully-connected networks (FCN), locally-connected networks (LCN), and
convolutional networks with and without pooling (GAP/VEC). We find that
learning is most efficient when these symmetries are compatible with those of
the data distribution and that performance significantly deteriorates when any
member of the (D, M, I) triplet is inconsistent or suboptimal.

cases where both the predictor and the response are distributional data,
modeled as members of a metric space. Our key step is to build universal
kernels (cc-universal) on the metric spaces, which results in reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces for the predictor and response that are rich enough to
characterize the conditional independence that determines sufficient dimension
reduction. For univariate distributions, we construct the universal kernel
using the Wasserstein distance, while for multivariate distributions, we resort
to the sliced Wasserstein distance. The sliced Wasserstein distance ensures
that the metric space possesses similar topological properties to the
Wasserstein space while also offering significant computation benefits.
Numerical results based on synthetic data show that our method outperforms
possible competing methods. The method is also applied to several data sets,
including fertility and mortality data and Calgary temperature data.

vanilla transformers to a spatiotemporal setting to learn the representation in
the 3D time-series domain, and applies Temporal Mutual Self-Attention (TMSA),
which captures adjacent dependencies, to extract deep and dynamic features. TNT
is capable of generating comparatively long-range predictions stably and
accurately, and we show that TNT outperforms the state-of-the-art U-net
simulator on several metrics. We also test the model performance with different

Although more experiments are needed, we conclude that TNT has great potential

generalizing continuous-state branching processes (CBs), by taking into account
a phenomenon of random collisions. Besides branching, characterized by a
general mechanism $\Psi$, at a constant rate in time two particles are sampled
uniformly in the population, collide and leave a mass of particles governed by
a (sub)critical mechanism $\Sigma$. Such CB processes with collisions (CBCs)
are shown to be the only Feller processes without negative jumps satisfying a
Laplace duality relationship with one-dimensional diffusions on the half-line.
This generalizes the duality observed for logistic CBs by Foucart. Via
time-change, CBCs are also related to an auxiliary class of Markov processes,
called CB processes with spectrally positive migration (CBMs), recently
introduced by Vidmar. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the

exist. The Laplace transform of the latter is provided. Under the assumption

distributions because it is theoretically elegant, easy to train, and has nice
manifold representations. However, when applied to image reconstruction and
synthesis tasks, VAE shows the limitation that the generated sample tends to be
blurry. We observe that a similar problem, in which the generated trajectory is
located between adjacent lanes, often arises in VAE-based trajectory
forecasting models. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a hierarchical
latent structure into the VAE-based forecasting model. Based on the assumption
that the trajectory distribution can be approximated as a mixture of simple
distributions (or modes), the low-level latent variable is employed to model
each mode of the mixture and the high-level latent variable is employed to
represent the weights for the modes. To model each mode accurately, we
condition the low-level latent variable using two lane-level context vectors
computed in novel ways, one corresponds to vehicle-lane interaction and the
other to vehicle-vehicle interaction. The context vectors are also used to
model the weights via the proposed mode selection network. To evaluate our

lot of interest for applications as well as fundamental studies due to their
rich optical properties. Assembly in van der Waals heterostacks can
significantly alter the intrinsic optical properties as well as the
wavelength-dependent absorption and emission efficiencies making a direct
comparison of e.g. photoluminescence intensities difficult. Here, we determine
the dielectric function for the prototypical MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer and their
individual layers. Apart from a redshift of 18 meV - 44 meV of the
energetically lowest interband transitions, we find that for larger energies
the dielectric function can only be described by treating the van der Waals
heterobilayer as a new artificial homobilayer crystal rather than a stack of
individual layers. The determined dielectric functions are applied to calculate
the Michelson contrast of the individual layers and the bilayer in dependence
of the oxide thickness of often used Si/SiO2 substrates. Our results highlight
the need to consider the altered dielectric functions impacting the Michelson
interference in the interpretation of intensities in optical measurements such
as Raman scattering or photoluminescence.

matrix in periodic systems when Gaussian basis set with pseudopotentials are
used. The usual algorithm for evaluating exchange matrix scales cubically with
the system size because one has to perform O(N2) fast Fourier transforms (FFT).
Here we introduce an algorithm that retains the cubic scaling but reduces the
prefactor significantly by eliminating the need to do FFTs during each exchange
build. This is accomplished by representing the products of Gaussian basis
function using a linear combination of an auxiliary basis the number of which
scales linearly with the size of the system. We store the potential due to
these auxiliary functions in memory which allows us to obtain the exchange
matrix without the need to do FFT, albeit at the cost of additional memory
requirement. Although the basic idea of using auxiliary functions is not new,
our algorithm is cheaper due to a combination of three ingredients: (a) we use
robust Pseudospectral method that allows us to use a relatively small number of
auxiliary basis to obtain high accuracy (b) we use occ-RI exchange which
eliminates the need to construct the full exchange matrix and (c) we use the
(interpolative separable density fitting) ISDF algorithm to construct these
auxiliary basis that are used in the robust pseudospectral method. The
resulting algorithm is accurate and we note that the error in the final energy
decreases exponentially rapidly with the number of auxiliary functions.

malicious client and a semi-trusted server such that the client only learns the
inference output while the server learns nothing. This problem is first
formulated by Lehmkuhl \textit{et al.} with a solution (MUSE, Usenix
Security'21), whose performance is then substantially improved by Chandran et
al.'s work (SIMC, USENIX Security'22). However, there still exists a nontrivial
gap in these efforts towards practicality, giving the challenges of overhead
reduction and secure inference acceleration in an all-round way.
  We propose SIMC 2.0, which complies with the underlying structure of SIMC,
but significantly optimizes both the linear and non-linear layers of the model.
Specifically, (1) we design a new coding method for homomorphic parallel
computation between matrices and vectors. It is custom-built through the
insight into the complementarity between cryptographic primitives in SIMC. As a
result, it can minimize the number of rotation operations incurred in the
calculation process, which is very computationally expensive compared to other
homomorphic operations e.g., addition, multiplication). (2) We reduce the size
of the garbled circuit (GC) (used to calculate nonlinear activation functions,
e.g., ReLU) in SIMC by about two thirds. Then, we design an alternative
lightweight protocol to perform tasks that are originally allocated to the
expensive GCs. Compared with SIMC, our experiments show that SIMC 2.0 achieves
a significant speedup by up to $17.4\times $ for linear layer computation, and
at least $1.3\times$ reduction of both the computation and communication
overheads in the implementation of non-linear layers under different data

$2.3\sim 4.3\times$ over SIMC on different state-of-the-art ML models.

  We investigate possible approaches to what might be called an

mathematics is concerned with constructive proofs, the agenda here is that the
objects that we study, specifically the class of numbers that we study, should
be an enumerable set of finite symbol strings. These might also be called
decidable constructive real numbers, that is our class of numbers should be a
computable sets of explicitly represented computable numbers.
  There have been various investigations of the computable numbers going back
to Turing. Most are however not expressed constructively, rather computable is
a property assigned to some of the abstract real numbers. Other definitions
define constructive real numbers without reference to the abstract R, but the
construction is undecidable, i.e., we cannot determine if a given construction
represents a computable real number or not. For example, we may define a real
as a computable convergent sequence of rationals, but cannot in general decide
if a given computable sequence is convergent.
  This paper explores several specific classes of decidable constructive real
numbers that could form foundational objects for what we might call an

S-Approx-DPC requires an approximation parameter but can speed up its
computational efficiency. We further present that their efficiencies can be

matching, which matches donors that are most similar to a target based on the

accuracy, the predictive distance may make matches look unconvincing, as the
profiles of the matched donors can substantially differ from the profile of the
target. To counterbalance this, similarity between the curves of the donors and
the target can be taken into account by combining the predictive distance with
the Mahalanobis distance into a `blended distance' measure. The properties of
this measure are evaluated in two simulation studies. Simulation study I
evaluates the performance of the blended distance under different
data-generating conditions. The results show that blending towards the
Mahalanobis distance leads to worse performance in terms of bias, coverage, and
predictive power. Simulation study II evaluates the blended metric in a setting
where a single value is imputed. The results show that a property of blending
is the bias-variance trade off. Giving more weight to the Mahalanobis distance
leads to less variance in the imputations, but less accuracy as well. The main
conclusion is that the high prediction accuracy achieved with the predictive

minimized using any optimizer for reconstruction. With stochastic optimizers,
this leads to variations of the well-known Yeong-Torquato algorithm.

Lorimer, Richard Prestage","Millisecond Cadence Radio Frequency Interference Filters","11 pages, 8 figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) greatly reduces sensitivity of radio
observations to astrophysical signals and creates false positive candidates in
searches for radio transients. Real signals are missed while considerable
computational and human resources are needed to remove RFI candidates. In the
context of transient astrophysics, this makes effective RFI removal vital to
effective searches for fast radio bursts and pulsars. Radio telescopes
typically sample at rates that are high enough for there to be tens to hundreds
of samples along the transient's pulse. Mitigation techniques should excise RFI
on this timescale to account for a changing radio frequency environment. We
evaluate the effectiveness of three filters, as well as a composite of the
three, that excises RFI at the cadence that the data are recorded. Each of
these filters operates in a different domain and thus excises as a different
RFI morphology. We analyze the performance of these four filters in three
different situations: (I) synthetic pulses in Gaussian noise; (II) synthetic
pulses injected into real data; (III) four pulsar observations. From these
tests, we gain insight into how the filters affect both the pulse and the noise
level. This allows use to outline which and how the filters should be used
based on the RFI present and the characteristics of the source signal. We show
by flagging a small percentage of the spectrum we can substantially improve the
quality of transit observations.

direction by allowing multiple clinical sites to collaboratively learn a global
model without centralizing datasets. However, using a single model to adapt to
various data distributions from different sites is extremely challenging.
Personalized FL tackles this issue by only utilizing partial model parameters
shared from global server, while keeping the rest to adapt to its own data
distribution in the local training of each site. However, most existing methods
concentrate on the partial parameter splitting, while do not consider the
\textit{inter-site in-consistencies} during the local training, which in fact
can facilitate the knowledge communication over sites to benefit the model
learning for improving the local accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
personalized federated framework with \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{C}alibration
(LC-Fed), to leverage the inter-site in-consistencies in both \textit{feature-
and prediction- levels} to boost the segmentation. Concretely, as each local
site has its alternative attention on the various features, we first design the
contrastive site embedding coupled with channel selection operation to
calibrate the encoded features. Moreover, we propose to exploit the knowledge
of prediction-level in-consistency to guide the personalized modeling on the
ambiguous regions, e.g., anatomical boundaries. It is achieved by computing a
disagreement-aware map to calibrate the prediction. Effectiveness of our method
has been verified on three medical image segmentation tasks with different
modalities, where our method consistently shows superior performance to the
state-of-the-art personalized FL methods. Code is available at

a Topic-Grained Text Representation-based Model for document retrieval.
Following the representation-based matching paradigm, TGTR stores the document
representations offline to ensure retrieval efficiency, whereas it
significantly reduces the storage requirements by using novel topicgrained

demonstrate that compared to word-grained baselines, TGTR is consistently

speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a small amount of
paired data and a large amount of unpaired text data are available.
Conventional studies form a cycle called the TTS-ASR pipeline, where the
multispeaker TTS model synthesizes speech from text with a reference speech and
the ASR model reconstructs the text from the synthesized speech, after which
both models are trained with a cycle-consistency loss. However, the synthesized
speech does not reflect the speaker characteristics of the reference speech and
the synthesized speech becomes overly easy for the ASR model to recognize after
training. This not only decreases the TTS model quality but also limits the ASR
model improvement. To solve this problem, we propose improving the
cycleconsistency-based training with a speaker consistency loss and step-wise
optimization. The speaker consistency loss brings the speaker characteristics
of the synthesized speech closer to that of the reference speech. In the
step-wise optimization, we first freeze the parameter of the TTS model before
both models are trained to avoid over-adaptation of the TTS model to the ASR
model. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

summary text are only rough proxies for summary quality, suffering from low
correlation with human scoring and inhibition of summary diversity. To solve
these problems, we propose SummScore, a comprehensive metric for summary
quality evaluation based on CrossEncoder. Firstly, by adopting the
original-summary measurement mode and comparing the semantics of the original
text, SummScore gets rid of the inhibition of summary diversity. With the help
of the text-matching pre-training Cross-Encoder, SummScore can effectively
capture the subtle differences between the semantics of summaries. Secondly, to
improve the comprehensiveness and interpretability, SummScore consists of four
fine-grained submodels, which measure Coherence, Consistency, Fluency, and
Relevance separately. We use semi-supervised multi-rounds of training to
improve the performance of our model on extremely limited annotated data.
Extensive experiments show that SummScore significantly outperforms existing
evaluation metrics in the above four dimensions in correlation with human
scoring. We also provide the quality evaluation results of SummScore on 16
mainstream summarization models for later research.

radiation-driven implosion mode of star formation because they show evidence of
triggered star formation. In our previous study, BRC 18 has been found to
accelerate away from the direction of the ionizing Hii region because of the
well known ""Rocket Effect"". Based on the assumption that both BRC 18 and the
candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) are kinematically coupled and using the
latest Gaia EDR3 measurements, we found that the relative proper motions of the
candidate YSOs exhibit a tendency of moving away from the ionizing source.
Using BRC 18 as a prototype, we made our further analysis for 21 more BRCs, a
majority of which showed a similar trend. For most of the BRCs, the median
angle of the relative proper motion of the candidate YSOs is similar to the
angle of on-sky direction from the ionizing source to the central IRAS source
of the BRC. Based on Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, we
found a strong correlation between these two angles, which is further supported
by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test on them. The strong correlation between
these two angles supports the ""Rocket Effect"" in the BRCs on the plane-of-sky.

signature of the inflationary SGWB, we argue the detectability of its universal
property: antipodal correlations, i.e., correlations of GWs from the opposite
directions, as a consequence of the horizon re-entry. A phase-coherent method
has been known to be of no use for detecting the angular correlations in SGWB
due to a problematic phase factor that erases the signal. We thus investigate
whether we can construct a phase-incoherent estimator of the antipodal
correlations in the intensity map. We found that the conclusion depends on
whether the inflationary GWs have statistical isotropy or not. In the standard
inflationary models with statistical homogeneity and isotropy, there is no
estimator that is sensitive to the antipodal correlations but does not suffer
from the problematic phase factor. On the other hand, it is possible to find a
non-vanishing estimator of the antipodal correlations for inflationary models
with statistical anisotropy. SGWB from anisotropic inflation is distinguishable
from the other components.

considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge
by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support
through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets
and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource
languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on
Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel
and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We
propose multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract
overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the
performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using a
human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a
novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess
translation safety. Our model achieves an improvement of 44% BLEU relative to
the previous state-of-the-art, laying important groundwork towards realizing a
universal translation system. Finally, we open source all contributions

autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR-based 3D recognition
tasks focus on single frame 3D point cloud data, and the temporal information
is ignored in those methods. We argue that the temporal information across the
frames provides crucial knowledge for 3D scene perceptions, especially in the
driving scenario. In this paper, we focus on spatial and temporal variations to
better explore the temporal information across the 3D frames. We design a
temporal variation-aware interpolation module and a temporal voxel-point
refiner to capture the temporal variation in the 4D point cloud. The temporal
variation-aware interpolation generates local features from the previous and
current frames by capturing spatial coherence and temporal variation
information. The temporal voxel-point refiner builds a temporal graph on the 3D
point cloud sequences and captures the temporal variation with a graph
convolution module. The temporal voxel-point refiner also transforms the coarse
voxel-level predictions into fine point-level predictions. With our proposed
modules, the new network TVSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
SemanticKITTI and SemantiPOSS. Specifically, our method achieves 52.5\% in mIoU

research attention in recent years. Although current methods have reached a
high up-to-scale accuracy, they usually fail to learn the true scale metric due
to the inherent scale ambiguity from training with monocular sequences. In this
work, we tackle this problem and propose DynaDepth, a novel scale-aware
framework that integrates information from vision and IMU motion dynamics.
Specifically, we first propose an IMU photometric loss and a cross-sensor
photometric consistency loss to provide dense supervision and absolute scales.
To fully exploit the complementary information from both sensors, we further
drive a differentiable camera-centric extended Kalman filter (EKF) to update
the IMU preintegrated motions when observing visual measurements. In addition,
the EKF formulation enables learning an ego-motion uncertainty measure, which
is non-trivial for unsupervised methods. By leveraging IMU during training,
DynaDepth not only learns an absolute scale, but also provides a better
generalization ability and robustness against vision degradation such as
illumination change and moving objects. We validate the effectiveness of
DynaDepth by conducting extensive experiments and simulations on the KITTI and
Make3D datasets.

requirements for future balancing services, the future need of balancing power
must first be known. Future power systems are often analysed by performing
simulations capturing the energy produced, consumed or transmitted for

(buyer) is to control her total expenditure within a time span under some
budget. Among all budget control approaches, throttling stands out as a popular
one, where the buyer participates in only a part of auctions. This paper gives
a theoretical panorama of a single buyer's dynamic budget throttling process in
repeated second-price auctions, which is lacking in the literature. We first
establish a lower bound on the regret and an upper bound on the asymptotic
competitive ratio for any throttling algorithm, respectively, on whether the
buyer's values are stochastic or adversarial. Second, on the algorithmic side,
we consider two different information structures, with increasing difficulty in
learning the stochastic distribution of the highest competing bid. We further
propose the OGD-CB algorithm, which is oblivious to stochastic or adversarial
values and has asymptotically equal results under these two information
structures. Specifically, with stochastic values, we demonstrate that this
algorithm guarantees a near-optimal expected regret. When values are
adversarial, we prove that the proposed algorithm reaches the upper bound on
the asymptotic competitive ratio. At last, we compare throttling with pacing,
another widely adopted budget control method, in repeated second-price
auctions. In the stochastic case, we illustrate that pacing is generally better
than throttling for the buyer, which is an extension of known results that
pacing is asymptotically optimal in this scenario. However, in the adversarial
case, we give an exciting result indicating that throttling is the
asymptotically optimal dynamic bidding strategy. Our results fill the gaps in
the theoretical research of throttling in repeated auctions and comprehensively
reveal the ability of this popular budget-smoothing strategy.

in the modern world, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) continue to promise
a lightweight alternative to high-cost encryption techniques and secure key
storage. While the security features promised by PUFs are highly attractive for
secure system designers, they have been shown to be vulnerable to various
sophisticated attacks - most notably Machine Learning (ML) based modelling
attacks (ML-MA) which attempt to digitally clone the PUF behaviour and thus
undermine their security. More recent ML-MA have even exploited publicly known
helper data required for PUF error correction in order to predict PUF responses
without requiring knowledge of response data. In response to this, research is
beginning to emerge regarding the authentication of PUF devices with the
assistance of ML as opposed to traditional PUF techniques of storage and
comparison of pre-known Challenge-Response pairs (CRPs). In this article, we
propose a classification system using ML based on a novel `PUF-Phenotype'
concept to accurately identify the origin and determine the validity of noisy
memory derived (DRAM) PUF responses as an alternative to helper data-reliant
denoising techniques. To our best knowledge, we are the first to perform
classification over multiple devices per model to enable a group-based PUF
authentication scheme. We achieve up to 98\% classification accuracy using a
modified deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction in
conjunction with several well-established classifiers. We also experimentally
verified the performance of our model on a Raspberry Pi device to determine the
suitability of deploying our proposed model in a resource-constrained

discrepancies between abnormal and normal cells are usually subtle. To
determine whether a cervical cell is normal or abnormal, cytopathologists
always take surrounding cells as references to identify its abnormality. To
mimic these behaviors, we propose to explore contextual relationships to boost
the performance of cervical abnormal cell detection. Specifically, both
contextual relationships between cells and cell-to-global images are exploited
to enhance features of each region of interest (RoI) proposals. Accordingly,
two modules, dubbed as RoI-relationship attention module (RRAM) and global RoI
attention module (GRAM), are developed and their combination strategies are
also investigated. We establish a strong baseline by using Double-Head Faster
R-CNN with feature pyramid network (FPN) and integrate our RRAM and GRAM into
it to validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Experiments conducted
on a large cervical cell detection dataset reveal that the introduction of RRAM
and GRAM both achieves better average precision (AP) than the baseline methods.
Moreover, when cascading RRAM and GRAM, our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we also show the proposed feature
enhancing scheme can facilitate both image-level and smear-level
classification. The code and trained models are publicly available at

that Betelgeuse was recorded with a colour significantly different (non-red)
than today (red, B$-$V=$1.78 \pm 0.05$ mag). Hyginus (Rome) and Sima Qian
(China) independently report it two millennia ago as appearing like Saturn
(B$-$V=$1.09 \pm 0.16$ mag) in colour and `yellow' (quantifiable as B$-$V=$0.95

colour change of Betelgeuse is a new, tight constraint for single-star
theoretical evolutionary models (or merger models). It is most likely located
less than one millennium past the bottom of the red giant branch, before which
rapid colour evolution is expected. Evolutionary tracks from MIST consistent
with both its colour evolution and its location on the CMD suggest a mass of
$\sim$14M$_{\odot}$ at $\sim$14 Myr. The (roughly) constant colour of Antares
for the last three millennia also constrains its mass and age. Wezen was

cases where there is an infinite reservoir of condensible species (i.e., an
ocean). We propose a new model for the internal structure and thermal evolution
of super-Earths with hydrogen envelopes. We derive the criterion for convective
inhibition in a generalizes phase mixture from first principles thermodynamics.
We then investigate the global ocean case using a water-hydrogen system, for
which we have data, as an example. We then extend our arguments to apply to a
system of hydrogen and silicate vapor. We then employ a simple atmospheric
model to apply our findings to super-Earths and to make predictions about their
internal structures and thermal evolution. For hydrogen envelope masses roughly
in the range between 0.1-10% Earth's mass, convective contact between the
envelope and core may shut down because of the compositional gradient that
arises from silicate partial vaporization. For envelope hydrogen masses that
cause the associated basal pressure to exceed the critical pressure of pure
silicate (of order a couple kilobars), the base of that envelope and top of the
core lie on the critical line of the two-phase hydrogen-silicate phase diagram.
The corresponding temperature is much higher than convective models would
suggest. The core then cools inefficiently, with intrinsic heat fluxes
potentially comparable to the Earth's internal heat flux today. This low heat
flux may allow the core to remain in a high entropy supercritical state for
billions of years, but the details of this depend on the nature of the
two-component phase diagram at high pressure, something that is currently
unknown. A supercritical core thermodynamically permits the dissolution of
large quantities of hydrogen into the core.

result, recent years have witnessed an explosion of research interest in the
RSODP (Origin-Destination Prediction for Ridesharing) problem with the goal of
predicting the future ridesharing requests and providing schedules for vehicles
ahead of time. Most of the existing prediction models utilise Deep Learning.
However, they fail to effectively consider both spatial and temporal dynamics.
In this paper the Baselined Gated Attention Recurrent Network (BGARN), is
proposed, which uses graph convolution with multi-head gated attention to
extract spatial features, a recurrent module to extract temporal features, and
a baselined transferring layer to calculate the final results. The model is
implemented with PyTorch and DGL (Deep Graph Library) and is experimentally
evaluated using the New York Taxi Demand Dataset. The results show that BGARN
outperforms all the other existing models in terms of prediction accuracy.

interactions of complex systems, ranging from higher-order collaboration
networks to brain networks. One open problem in the field is what should drive
the choice of the adopted mathematical framework to describe higher-order
networks starting from data of higher-order interactions. Unweighted simplicial
complexes typically involve a loss of information of the data, though having
the benefit to capture the higher-order topology of the data. In this work we
show that weighted simplicial complexes allow to circumvent all the limitations
of unweighted simplicial complexes to represent higher-order interactions. In
particular, weighted simplicial complexes can represent higher-order networks
without loss of information, allowing at the same time to capture the weighted
topology of the data. The higher-order topology is probed by studying the
spectral properties of suitably defined weighted Hodge Laplacians displaying a
normalized spectrum. The higher-order spectrum of (weighted) normalized Hodge
Laplacians is here studied combining cohomology theory with information theory.
In the proposed framework, we quantify and compare the information content of
higher-order spectra of different dimension using higher-order spectral
entropies and spectral relative entropies. The proposed methodology is tested
on real higher-order collaboration networks and on the weighted version of the
simplicial complex model ""Network Geometry with Flavor"".

transform a prior distribution to a model distribution by solving an ordinary
differential equation (ODE). We propose to train CNFs on manifolds by
minimizing probability path divergence (PPD), a novel family of divergences
between the probability density path generated by the CNF and a target
probability density path. PPD is formulated using a logarithmic mass
conservation formula which is a linear first order partial differential
equation relating the log target probabilities and the CNF's defining vector
field. PPD has several key benefits over existing methods: it sidesteps the
need to solve an ODE per iteration, readily applies to manifold data, scales to
high dimensions, and is compatible with a large family of target paths
interpolating pure noise and data in finite time. Theoretically, PPD is shown
to bound classical probability divergences. Empirically, we show that CNFs
learned by minimizing PPD achieve state-of-the-art results in likelihoods and
sample quality on existing low-dimensional manifold benchmarks, and is the
first example of a generative model to scale to moderately high dimensional

information freshness sensing scenarios, such as remote monitoring systems or
self-driving systems, in which information freshness plays a critical part. In
this paper, by taking the Age of Information (AoI) as the primary performance
indicator, the information freshness using AMP-based grant-free scheme is
investigated and compared with grant-based scheme. Base on the analysis, a user
scheduling strategy with sleep threshold and forcing active threshold is
proposed to further reduce average AoI (AAoI). Numerical results reveal that
the AMP-based grant-free scheme can provide sufficient access capability with
less pilot resources, and it is robust to the fluctuation of the number of

network's benefits are down-weighted for dense regression tasks as these

deep learning thus far to non-discovery-oriented applications. In this paper,
the Deep Learning Signal-to-Noise Ratio (DeepSNR) detection pipeline, which
uses a novel method for generating a signal-to-noise ratio ranking statistic
from deep learning classifiers, is introduced, providing the first foundation
for the use of deep learning algorithms in discovery-oriented pipelines. The

the emission line signatures that robustly signify the presence of Pop. III
stars against other possible contaminants represents a key challenge for
interpreting JWST data. To this end, we run high-resolution (sub-pc)
cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the region around a dwarf
galaxy at $z\geq10$ to predict the emission line signatures of the Pop.
III/Pop. II transition. We show that the absence of metal emission lines is a
poor diagnostic of Pop. III stars because metal-enriched galaxies in our
simulation can maintain low [OIII] 5007${\rm \r{A}}$ emission that may be
undetectable due to sensitivity limits. Combining spectral hardness probes
(e.g. HeII 1640${\rm \r{A}}$/H$\alpha$) with metallicity diagnostics is more
likely to probe the presence of metal-free stars, although contamination from
Wolf-Rayet stars, X-ray binaries, or black holes may be important. The hard
emission from Pop. III galaxies fades fast due to the short stellar lifetimes
of massive Pop. III stars, which could further inhibit detection. Similarly,
Pop. III stars may be detectable after they evolve off the main-sequence due to
the cooling radiation from nebular gas or a supernova remnant; however, these
signatures are also short-lived (i.e. few Myr), and contaminants such as
flickering black holes might confuse this diagnostic. While JWST will provide a
unique opportunity to spectroscopically probe the nature of the earliest
galaxies, both the short timescales associated with pristine systems and
ambiguities in interpreting key diagnostic emission lines may hinder progress.

Most of the
past works focused on removing rain and haze phenomena in images. However, snow
is also an extremely common atmospheric phenomenon that will seriously affect
the performance of high-level computer vision tasks, such as object detection
and semantic segmentation. Recently, some methods have been proposed for snow
removing, and most methods deal with snow images directly as the optimization
object. However, the distribution of snow location and shape is complex.
Therefore, failure to detect snowflakes / snow streak effectively will affect
snow removing and limit the model performance. To solve these issues, we
propose a Snow Mask Guided Adaptive Residual Network (SMGARN). Specifically,
SMGARN consists of three parts, Mask-Net, Guidance-Fusion Network (GF-Net), and
Reconstruct-Net. Firstly, we build a Mask-Net with Self-pixel Attention (SA)
and Cross-pixel Attention (CA) to capture the features of snowflakes and
accurately localized the location of the snow, thus predicting an accurate snow
mask. Secondly, the predicted snow mask is sent into the specially designed
GF-Net to adaptively guide the model to remove snow. Finally, an efficient
Reconstruct-Net is used to remove the veiling effect and correct the image to
reconstruct the final snow-free image. Extensive experiments show that our
SMGARN numerically outperforms all existing snow removal methods, and the
reconstructed images are clearer in visual contrast. All codes will be
available.

The proposed methods include both a naive fusion scheme, where all the inducers

understanding the size and significance of any discrepancy between the Standard
Model prediction and experimental results being obtained by the Muon g-2
experiment at Fermilab. The Standard Model prediction is currently based on a
data-driven approach to the HVP using experimental results for
$\sigma(e^+e^-\rightarrow\,\mathrm{hadrons})$. Lattice QCD aims to provide a
result with similar uncertainty from calculated vector-vector correlation
functions, but the growth of statistical and systematic errors in the $u/d$
quark correlation functions at large Euclidean time has made this difficult to
achieve. We show that restricting the lattice contributions to a one-sided
window $0<t<t_1$ can greatly improve lattice results while still capturing a
large fraction of the total HVP. We illustrate this by comparing windowed
lattice results based on the 2019 Fermilab Lattice/HPQCD/MILC HVP analysis with
corresponding results obtained from the KNT19 analysis of $R_{e^+e^-}$ data.
For $t_1=1.5$ fm, 70% of the total HVP is contained within the window and our
lattice result has an error of~0.7%, only about twice as big as the error from
the $e^+e^-$~analysis. We see a tension of 2.7$\sigma$ between the two results.
With increased statistics in the lattice data the one-sided windows will allow
stringent tests of lattice and $R_{e^+e^-}$ results that include a large

  and a Comparative Study","Submitted",,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper proposes three new approaches for additive functional regression
models with a functional response. The first is based on a reformulation of the
linear regression model, while the last two are on the yet scarce case of
additive nonlinear functional regression models. All proposals are based on
extensions of similar models for scalar responses. One of the proposed
nonlinear models is based on constructing a Spectral Additive Model, which is
restricted to Hilbertian spaces. The other one extends the kernel estimator for
functional response and more than one functional covariate. The latter can be
applied to general metric spaces since it is only based on distances. The new
approaches as well as real data sets are included in the developer version of R
package \texttt{fda.usc} available on GitHub. The performances of the new
proposals are compared with previous ones, which we review theoretically and
practically in this paper. The simulation results show the advantages of the
nonlinear proposals and the small loss of efficiency when the simulation
scenario is truly linear. The supplementary material also provides a
visualization tool for checking the linearity of the relationship between a
single covariate and the response, as well as more simulation and data analysis
results.

  Orders",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the dynamic fulfillment problem in e-commerce, in which incoming
(multi-item) customer orders must be immediately dispatched to (a combination
of) fulfillment centers that have the required inventory.
  A prevailing approach to this problem, pioneered by Jasin and Sinha (2015),
is to write a ``deterministic'' linear program that dictates, for each item in
an incoming multi-item order from a particular region, how frequently it should
be dispatched to each fulfillment center (FC). However, dispatching items in a
way that satisfies these frequency constraints, without splitting the order
across too many FC's, is challenging. Jasin and Sinha identify this as a
correlated rounding problem, and propose an intricate rounding scheme that they
prove is suboptimal by a factor of at most $\approx q/4$ on a $q$-item order.
  This paper provides to our knowledge the first substantially improved scheme
for this correlated rounding problem, which is suboptimal by a factor of at
most $1+\ln(q)$. We provide another scheme for sparse networks, which is
suboptimal by a factor of at most $d$ if each item is stored in at most $d$
FC's. We show both of these guarantees to be tight in terms of the dependence
on $q$ or $d$. Our schemes are simple and fast, based on an intuitive idea --
items wait for FC's to ``open'' at random times, but observe them on
``dilated'' time scales. This also implies a new randomized rounding method for
the classical Set Cover problem, which could be of general interest.
  We numerically test our new rounding schemes under the same realistic setups
as Jasin and Sinha (2015) and find that they improve runtimes, shorten code,
and robustly improve performance. Our code is made publicly available.

reproducing vivid scenes by manipulating the optical properties of light using
ultra-compact devices. However, achieving multiple holographic images using a
single metasurface is still difficult due to the capacity limit of a single
meta-atom. In this work, we present an inverse design method based on
gradient-descent optimization to encode multiple pieces of holographic
information into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse
design of single-celled metasurfaces without the need for complex meta-atom
design strategies, facilitating high-throughput fabrication using broadband low
loss materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane RGB
color holograms and 3D holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated.
Up to eighteen distinct metasurface-generated holographic images are
demonstrated, achieving the state-of-the-art data capacity of a single
phase-only metasurface. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first
experimental demonstration of metasurface-generated 3D holograms that have
completely independent and distinct images in each plane. By demonstrating the
high-density holographic information of a single metasurface, the current
research findings provide a viable route for practical metasurfaces-generated
holography, ultimately stepping towards applications in optical storage,
displays, and full-color imaging.

candles in the optical for several decades. However, SNe Ia have shown to be
more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust
extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of
using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given
the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in $J$ and/or $H$
band, plus good $gr$-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak
magnitudes in $J$ ($J_{max}$) and $H$ ($H_{max}$) bands. The use of a single
NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of $\sim0.05$ mag for epochs
around the time of $B$-band peak magnitude ($T_{max}$). We also tested the
effect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of
$T_{max}$ and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes. Both
cadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained the
introduced scatter of each to $<0.02$ mag in $J_{max}$ and $<0.01$ in
$H_{max}$. However, these effects are expected to be negligible, provided the
data quality is comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe
($z\lesssim0.1$). The effect of S/N in the NIR was tested as well. For SNe Ia
at $0.08<z\lesssim0.1$, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the
CSP sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a minimum
($\lesssim0.05$ mag). These results provide confidence for our FLOWS project
that aims in using SNe Ia with public ZTF optical light curves and few NIR
epochs to map out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will
allow us to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own supercluster,
Laniakea, and test the standard cosmological model by measuring the growth rate
of structures, parameterised by $fD$, and the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant,
$H_0$.

admit several different symmetries: the direct product symmetry, the extended

discuss the prospects of measuring MO with two under-construction experiments

significance as long as certain experimental challenges are met. In particular,
JUNO needs better than 3$\%$ energy resolution for MO measurement. On the other
hand, T2HK has rather poor prospects at measuring the MO, especially for
certain ranges of the CP violating parameter $\delta_{\rm CP}$, posing a major
drawback for T2HK. In this letter we show that the synergy between JUNO and
T2HK will bring two-fold advantage. Firstly, the synergy between the two
experiments helps us determine the MO at a very high significance. With the
baseline set-up of the two experiments, we have a greater than $9\sigma$
determination of the MO for all values of $\delta_{\rm CP}$. Secondly, the
synergy also allows us to relax the constraints on the two experiments. We show
that JUNO, could perform extremely well even for energy resolution of 5$\%$,
while for T2HK the MO problem with ""bad"" values of $\delta_{\rm CP}$ goes away.
The MO sensitivity for the combined analysis is expected to be greater than
$6\sigma$ for all values of $\delta_{\rm CP}$ and with just 5$\%$ energy
resolution for JUNO.

new prescription for the mass-loss rate obtained from hydrodynamical
calculations in which the wind velocity profile, $v(r)$, and the
line-acceleration, $g_\text{line}$, are obtained in a self consistently way.
Replacing mass-loss rates at the Main Sequence stage from the standard Vink's
formula by our new recipe, we generate a new set of evolutionary tracks for
$M_\text{ZAMS}=25,40,70$ and $120\,M_\odot$ and metallicities $Z=0.014$
(Galactic), $Z=0.006$ (LMC), and $Z=0.002$ (SMC).
  Our new derived formula for mass-loss rate predicts a dependence $\dot
M\propto Z^a$, where $a$ is not longer constant but dependent on the stellar
mass: ranging from $a\sim0.53$ when $M_*\sim120\;M_\odot$, to $a\sim1.02$ when
$M_*\sim25\;M_\odot$.
  We found that models adopting the new recipe for $\dot M$ retain more mass
during their evolution, which is expressed in larger radii and consequently
more luminous tracks over the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These differences
are more prominent for the cases of $M_\text{ZAMS}=70$ and 120 $M_\odot$ at
solar metallicity, where we found self-consistent tracks are $\sim0.1$ dex
brighter and keep extra mass up to 20 $M_\odot$, compared with the classical
models using the previous formulation for mass-loss rate.
  Moreover, we observed remarkable differences for the evolution of the
radionuclide isotope $^{26}$Al in the core and the surface of the star. Since
$\dot M_\text{sc}$ are weaker than the commonly adopted values for evolutionary
tracks, self-consistent tracks predict a later modification in the abundance
number of $^{26}$Al in the stellar winds. This new behaviour could provide
useful information about the real contribution of this isotope from massive
stars to the Galactic interstellar medium.

once the field is turned on, the liquid crystal rotates coherently triggering a
concurrent orbital motion of both droplets around each other, an effect due to
the momentum transfer to the surrounding fluid. In addition the topological
defects, resulting from the conflict orientation of the liquid crystal within

create more human-like behaviour in robots to make the collaboration between a
human and a robot more intuitive to the human partner. In order to develop a
human-like collaborative robotic system, however, human collaboration must
first be better understood. Human collaboration is something we are all
familiar with, however not that much is known about it from a kinematic

occurs in human collaboration, is for instance leader-follower dynamics. In our
previous study, we tackled the question of leader-follower role allocation in
human dyads during a collaborative reaching task, where the results implied
that the subjects who performed higher in the individual experiment would
naturally assume the role of a leader when in physical collaboration. In this

by observing how the leader-follower dynamics change when the collaborative

where one subject in a dyad was faced with an additional task of obstacle
avoidance when performing a 2D reaching task, while their partner was not aware
of the obstacle. We have found that subjects change their roles throughout the
task in order to complete it successfully, however looking at the overall task
leader the higher-performing individual will always dominate over the
lower-performing one, regardless of whether they are aware of the additional
task of obstacle avoidance or not.

method for creating acceptable control models is to attempt to mimic human-like
behaviour in robots so that their actions appear more intuitive to humans. To
investigate how task complexity affects human perception and acceptance of
their robot partner, we propose a novel human-based robot control model for
obstacle avoidance that can account for the leader-follower dynamics that
normally occur in human collaboration. The performance and acceptance of the
proposed control method were evaluated using an obstacle avoidance scenario in
which we compared task performance between individual tasks and collaborative
tasks with different leader-follower dynamics roles for the robotic partner.
The evaluation results showed that the robot control method is able to
replicate human behaviour to improve the overall task performance of the
subject in collaboration. However, regarding the acceptance of the robotic
partner, the participants' opinions were mixed. Compared to the results of a
study with a similar control method developed for a less complex task, the new
results show a lower acceptance of the proposed control model, even though the
control method was adapted to the more complex task from a dynamic standpoint.
This suggests that the complexity of the collaborative task at hand increases
the need not only for a more complex control model but also a more socially
competent control model.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Imbalanced training data is a significant challenge for medical image
classification. In this study, we propose a novel Progressive Class-Center
Triplet (PCCT) framework to alleviate the class imbalance issue particularly
for diagnosis of rare diseases, mainly by carefully designing the triplet
sampling strategy and the triplet loss formation. Specifically, the PCCT
framework includes two successive stages. In the first stage, PCCT trains the
diagnosis system via a class-balanced triplet loss to coarsely separate
distributions of different classes. In the second stage, the PCCT framework
further improves the diagnosis system via a class-center involved triplet loss
to cause a more compact distribution for each class. For the class-balanced
triplet loss, triplets are sampled equally for each class at each training
iteration, thus alleviating the imbalanced data issue. For the class-center
involved triplet loss, the positive and negative samples in each triplet are
replaced by their corresponding class centers, which enforces data
representations of the same class closer to the class center. Furthermore, the
class-center involved triplet loss is extended to the pair-wise ranking loss
and the quadruplet loss, which demonstrates the generalization of the proposed
framework. Extensive experiments support that the PCCT framework works
effectively for medical image classification with imbalanced training images.
On two skin image datasets and one chest X-ray dataset, the proposed approach
respectively obtains the mean F1 score 86.2, 65.2, and 90.66 over all classes
and 81.4, 63.87, and 81.92 for rare classes, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and outperforming the widely used methods for the class imbalance
issue.

LASSO-PCA (LPCA) explores a pool of predictions based on a single model but

select tuning parameters and hence reduces the impact of researchers' at hock
decisions. The method is applied to average predictions of hourly day-ahead
electricity prices over 650 point forecasts obtained with various lengths of
calibration windows. It is evaluated on four European and American markets with
almost two and a half year of out-of-sample period and compared to other semi-

results indicate that the LASSO averaging is very efficient in terms of

outperforms other approaches in terms of MAE, remaining insensitive the the

a linkage with the same pattern as $L$ that is ""internally combed"" by $P$, in
the sense that $L\cap C_{p}\subseteq P\cap C_{p}$. In fact, we prove this
result in the most general version where the linkage $L$ is $s$-scattered: no
two vertices of distinct paths of $L$ are within distance at most $s$. We
deduce several variants of this result in the cases where $s=0$ and $s>0$.

an IMU calibration method that does not require external precision equipment or
complex procedures. This allows end-users or personnel without expert knowledge
of inertial measurement to re-calibrate the sensors by placing them in several
suitable but not precisely defined orientations. In this work, we present
several improvements to Tedaldi's method, both on the algorithmic level and the
calibration procedure: adaptions for low noise accelerometers, a calibration
helper object, and packet loss compensation for wireless calibration. We
applied the modified calibration procedure to our custom-built IMU platform and
verified the consistency of results across multiple calibration runs. In order
to minimize the time needed for re-calibration, we analyzed how the calibration
result accuracy degrades when fewer calibration orientations are used. We found
that N=12 different orientations are sufficient to achieve a very good
calibration, and more orientations yielded only marginal improvements. This is
a significant improvement compared to the 37 to 50 orientations recommended by
Tedaldi. Thus, we were reduced the time required to calibrate a single IMU from
ca. 5 minutes to less than 2 minutes without sacrificing any meaningful
calibration accuracy.

two relational tables refer to the same real-world entity, is one of the
fundamental problems in data management. Traditional EM assumes that two tables
are homogeneous with the aligned schema, while it is common that entity records
of different formats (e.g., relational, semi-structured, or textual types)
involve in practical scenarios. It is not practical to unify their schemas due
to the different formats. To support EM on format-different entity records,
Generalized Entity Matching (GEM) has been proposed and gained much attention
recently. To do GEM, existing methods typically perform in a supervised
learning way, which relies on a large amount of high-quality labeled examples.
However, the labeling process is extremely labor-intensive, and frustrates the
use of GEM. Low-resource GEM, i.e., GEM that only requires a small number of
labeled examples, becomes an urgent need. To this end, this paper, for the
first time, focuses on the low-resource GEM and proposes a novel low-resource
GEM method, termed as PromptEM. PromptEM has addressed three challenging issues
(i.e., designing GEM-specific prompt-tuning, improving pseudo-labels quality,
and running efficient self-training) in low-resource GEM. Extensive
experimental results on eight real benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of
PromptEM in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

(EM) field plus its interaction with the axions, and is accordingly a
physically open system. It means that the four-divergence of the EM
energy-momentum tensor is different from zero, implying in turn that the total
EM energy and momentum (when integrated over all space) do not constitute a
four-vector. The EM force is in principle accessible to experimental detection,
just analogous to what is the case in ordinary electrodynamics. In the first
half of this paper the energy-momentum aspects of axion electrodynamics are
worked out in general, when the surroundings are allowed to be a medium with
constant permittivity and permeability. In the second half, two examples are
discussed. The first is a static situation, where a block of uniform material
containing axions is exposed to external strong electric and magnetic fields.
Assuming the axion amplitude $a(x)$ (i.e. its density) to increase linearly in
one direction, we calculate the axion-generated forces. As a second example, we
consider axions varying not with position but instead harmonically with time;
this is the constellation usually assumed in astrophysics. Assuming a Gaussian
profile for the EM wave emitted from the Earth towards an axion cloud in outer
space, we make a calculation of the 'axion echo', the return signal.

assumption that global inconsistency is dominated by local inconsistencies and
devise a generic Contrastive Coherence Preserving Loss (CCPL) applied to local
patches. CCPL can preserve the coherence of the content source during style
transfer without degrading stylization. Moreover, it owns a neighbor-regulating
mechanism, resulting in a vast reduction of local distortions and considerable
visual quality improvement. Aside from its superior performance on versatile
style transfer, it can be easily extended to other tasks, such as
image-to-image translation. Besides, to better fuse content and style features,
we propose Simple Covariance Transformation (SCT) to effectively align
second-order statistics of the content feature with the style feature.

low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution multispectral
image (HR-MSI) to produce a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI).
Tensor analysis has been proven to be an efficient method for hyperspectral
image processing. However, the existing tensor-based methods of hyperspectral
image super-resolution like the tensor train and tensor ring decomposition only
establish an operation between adjacent two factors and are highly sensitive to
the permutation of tensor modes, leading to an inadequate and inflexible
representation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for hyperspectral
image super-resolution by utilizing the specific properties of high-order
tensors in fully-connected tensor network decomposition. The proposed method
first tensorizes the target HR-HSI into a high-order tensor that has multiscale
spatial structures. Then, a coupled fully-connected tensor network
decomposition model is proposed to fuse the corresponding high-order tensors of
LR-HSI and HR-MSI. Moreover, a weighted-graph regularization is imposed on the
spectral core tensors to preserve spectral information. In the proposed model,
the superiorities of the fully-connected tensor network decomposition lie in
the outstanding capability for characterizing adequately the intrinsic
correlations between any two modes of tensors and the essential invariance for
transposition. Experimental results on three data sets show the effectiveness
of the proposed approach as compared to other hyperspectral image
super-resolution methods.

on this observation, we introduced a heuristic to determine an ordering which
reduces the total cost of adaptive learning in both case studies.

missing modalities when just a subset is perceived. Using a simple

By storing both the images and labels as modalities, a single Memory can be

multi-conjugate convex functions, as well as between uni- and multi-dimensional
underlying spaces.

number of proper $m$-colorings of $G$ for each $m \in \mathbb{N}$. In 1990,
Kostochka and Sidorenko introduced the list color function of graph $G$,
denoted $P_{\ell}(G,m)$, which is a list analogue of the chromatic polynomial.
The list color function threshold of $G$, denoted $\tau(G)$, is the smallest $k
\geq \chi(G)$ such that $P_{\ell}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \geq k$. It is
known that for every graph $G$, $\tau(G)$ is finite, and in fact, $\tau(G) \leq
(|E(G)|-1)/\ln(1+ \sqrt{2}) + 1$. It is also known that when $G$ is a cycle or
chordal graph, $G$ is enumeratively chromatic-choosable which means $\tau(G) =
\chi(G)$. A recent paper of Kaul et al. suggests that understanding the list
color function threshold of complete bipartite graphs is essential to the study
of the extremal behavior of $\tau$. In this paper we show that for any $n \geq
2$, $\tau(K_{2,n}) \leq \lceil (n+2.05)/1.24 \rceil$ which gives an improvement
on the general upper bound for $\tau(G)$ when $G = K_{2,n}$. We also develop
additional tools that allow us to show that $\tau(K_{2,3}) = \chi(K_{2,3})$ and
$\tau(K_{2,4}) = \tau(K_{2,5}) = 3$.

opportunity for advancing our understanding of neural information processing at
multiple scales and improving performance of brain computer interfaces.
However, most existing analytical techniques fall short of capturing the
complexity of interactions within the concerted population activity. Vine
copula-based approaches have shown to be successful at addressing complex
high-order dependencies within the population, disentangled from the
single-neuron statistics. However, most applications have focused on parametric
copulas which bear the risk of misspecifying dependence structures. In order to
avoid this risk, we adopted a fully non-parametric approach for the
single-neuron margins and copulas by using Neural Spline Flows (NSF). We
validated the NSF framework on simulated data of continuous and discrete type
with various forms of dependency structures and with different dimensionality.
Overall, NSFs performed similarly to existing non-parametric estimators, while
allowing for considerably faster and more flexible sampling which also enables
faster Monte Carlo estimation of copula entropy. Moreover, our framework was
able to capture low and higher order heavy tail dependencies in neuronal
responses recorded in the mouse primary visual cortex during a visual learning
task while the animal was navigating a virtual reality environment. These
findings highlight an often ignored aspect of complexity in coordinated
neuronal activity which can be important for understanding and deciphering

continuously. Because of the low computational complexity of the calibration
technique, it is suitable for an on-chip implementation. Ultimately, this work
contains an analysis of the stability and convergence behavior as well as

decreases the barrier-crossing time as compared to long barrier memory. This is
in contrast with the short well-memory regime, where both our numerical results

smaller than the energy of separable states. We also consider a family of
entanglement witnesses related to the entanglement negativity of the state. We
test the witnesses in infinite and finite systems. We study how the temperature
bounds obtained are influenced by a quantum phase-transition or a disorder line
in the ground state. Very strong finite-size corrections are observed in the
ordered phase due to the presence of a quasi-degenerate excitation. We also
study the postquench states in the thermodynamic limit after a quench when the
parameters of the Hamiltonian are changed suddenly. In the case of the Ising
model, we find that the mixed postquench state is detected as entangled by the
two methods if the parameters of the Hamiltonian before and after the quench
are close to each other. We find that the two witnesses give qualitatively
similar results, showing that energy-based entanglement witnesses are efficient
in detecting the nearest-neighbor entanglement in spin chains in various
circumstances. For other XY models, we find that the negativity based witnesses
also detect states in some parameter regions where the energy-based witness
does not, in particular, if the quench is performed from the paramagnetic phase

Blockchain-based Federated Forests (BFFs) could be used to train ML models

created this way are still vulnerable to evasion, poisoning, and exploratory

various possible adversarial examples on the BFF-IDS. We proposed integrating a
statistical detector to detect and extract unknown adversarial samples. By
including the unknown detected samples into the dataset of the detector, we
augment the BFF-IDS with an additional model to detect original known attacks
and the new adversarial inputs. The statistical adversarial detector
confidently detected adversarial examples at the sample size of 50 and 100

mitigates the adversarial examples with more than 96% accuracy. With this
approach, the model will continue to be augmented in a sandbox whenever an
adversarial sample is detected and subsequently adopt the BFF-IDS(AUG) as the
active security model. Consequently, the proposed integration of the

problems, where the goal is to select the video which corresponds to the text
query between a given text query and a pool of candidate videos. The
contrastive paradigm of vision-language pretraining has shown promising success
with large-scale datasets and unified transformer architecture, and
demonstrated the power of a joint latent space. Despite this, the intrinsic
divergence between the visual domain and textual domain is still far from being
eliminated, and projecting different modalities into a joint latent space might
result in the distorting of the information inside the single modality. To
overcome the above issue, we present a novel mechanism for learning the
translation relationship from a source modality space $\mathcal{S}$ to a target
modality space $\mathcal{T}$ without the need for a joint latent space, which
bridges the gap between visual and textual domains. Furthermore, to keep cycle
consistency between translations, we adopt a cycle loss involving both forward
translations from $\mathcal{S}$ to the predicted target space $\mathcal{T'}$,
and backward translations from $\mathcal{T'}$ back to $\mathcal{S}$. Extensive
experiments conducted on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo datasets demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of our LaT approach compared with vanilla

WLANs standards are developed mainly for the purpose of communication, and thus
may not be able to meet the stringent sensing requirements in emerging

802.11bf, has been established by the IEEE 802.11 working group, with the
objective of creating a new amendment to the WLAN standard to provide advanced
sensing requirements while minimizing the effect on communications. This paper
provides a comprehensive overview on the up-to-date efforts in the IEEE
802.11bf TG. First, we introduce the definition of the 802.11bf amendment and
its standardization timeline. Then, we discuss the WLAN sensing procedure and
framework used for measurement acquisition, by considering both conventional
sensing at sub-7 GHz and directional multi-gigabit (DMG) sensing at 60 GHz,
respectively. Next, we present various candidate technical features for IEEE
802.11bf, including waveform/sequence design, feedback types, quantization, as
well as security and privacy. Finally, we describe the methodologies used by
the IEEE 802.11bf TG to evaluate the alternative performance. It is desired
that this overview paper provide useful insights on IEEE 802.11 WLAN sensing to

injection attacks on uncertain control systems. We consider an adversary with
complete system knowledge, injecting stealthy false data into an uncertain
control system. We then use the Value-at-Risk to characterize the risk
associated with the attack impact caused by the adversary. The worst-case
attack impact is characterized by the recently proposed output-to-output gain.
We observe that the risk assessment problem corresponds to an infinite
non-convex robust optimization problem. To this end, we use dissipative system
theory and the scenario approach to approximate the risk-assessment problem
into a convex problem and also provide probabilistic certificates on
approximation. Secondly, we consider the problem of security measure
allocation. We consider an operator with a constraint on the security budget.
Under this constraint, we propose an algorithm to optimally allocate the
security measures using the calculated risk such that the resulting
Value-at-risk is minimized. Finally, we illustrate the results through a
numerical example. The numerical example also illustrates that the security
allocation using the Value-at-risk, and the impact on the nominal system may
have different outcomes: thereby depicting the benefit of using risk metrics.

the most favourable interactions in the domains, the CDW phase must be

full Standard Model contribution to King nonlinearity. This makes searching for
beyond-the-Standard-Model physics with King linearity analysis possible in a
very-high-precision experimental regime, avoiding confounds. The bounds which
can be set on beyond-the-Standard-Model parameters remain limited by the
uncertainties on the small Standard Model nuclear corrections which cause King

of isotopes is advocated as a more suitable approach for few-electron ions.

Connectivity in the streaming paradigm. On the positive end, we show that
knowing a vertex cover of size $k$ allows for algorithms in the Adjacency List
(AL) streaming model whose number of passes is constant and memory is $O(\log
n)$ for any fixed $k$. Underlying these algorithms is a method to execute a
breadth-first search in $O(k)$ passes and $O(k \log n)$ bits of memory. On the
negative end, we show that many other parameters lead to lower bounds in the AL
model, where $\Omega(n/p)$ bits of memory is needed for any $p$-pass algorithm
even for constant parameter values. In particular, this holds for graphs with a
known modulator (deletion set) of constant size to a graph that has no induced
subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph $H$, for most $H$. For some cases, we can
also show one-pass, $\Omega(n \log n)$ bits of memory lower bounds. We also
prove a much stronger $\Omega(n^2/p)$ lower bound for Diameter on bipartite

sufficient to model a system with a single state space model. However, there
are applications in which a system changes its behavior deterministically or
stochastically. A previously defined model then describes the behavior of the
system only inaccurately or is even no longer valid. The state of the art is to
use more than one system models in parallel and to derive a suitable system

Multiple Model (MM) method. Depending on the application and requirements,
different methods exist for this purpose, which determine a single state

ingredient for resolving this ambiguity through the concept of a selection map

Using such maps, we define a class of hierarchical games between two agents

requires introducing new analytical tools in Morse theory to extend implicit

total indices when features are independent and a variant of total indices when
features are correlated. We show that this variant possesses the zero
independence property. With synthetic datasets, we analyse how the mean
dimension evolves layer by layer and how the activation function impacts the
magnitude of interactions. We then use the mean dimension to study some of the
most widely employed convolutional architectures for image recognition (LeNet,
ResNet, DenseNet). To account for pixel correlations, we propose calculating
the mean dimension after the addition of an inverse PCA layer that allows one
to work on uncorrelated PCA-transformed features, without the need to retrain
the neural network. We use the generalized total indices to produce heatmaps
for post-hoc explanations, and we employ the mean dimension on the
PCA-transformed features for cross comparisons of the artificial neural
networks structures. Results provide several insights on the difference in

Network in South Australia. Its pre-atmosphere orbit suggests it was
temporarily captured by the Earth-Moon system before impact. A search was
conducted two years after the fall, and a meteorite was found after 6 days of
searching. The meteorite appeared relatively fresh, had a mass consistent with
fireball observation predictions, and was at the predicted location within
uncertainties. However, the meteorite did show some weathering and lacked
short-lived radionuclides ($^{58}$Co, $^{54}$Mn). A terrestrial age based on
cosmogenic $^{14}$C dating was determined; the meteorite has been on the
Earth's surface for $3.2\pm1.3$ kyr, ruling out it being connected to the 2016
fireball. Using an upper limit on the pleistieocene terrain age and the total
searched area, we find that the contamination probability from another fall is
$<2\%$. Thus, the retrieval of the ""wrong"" meteorite is at odds with the
contamination statistics. This is a key example to show that fireball-meteorite

the model's performance and the style features can be well represented by the
channel-wise mean and standard deviation of images. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adversarial style augmentation (AdvStyle) approach, which can
dynamically generate hard stylized images during training and thus can
effectively prevent the model from overfitting on the source domain.
Specifically, AdvStyle regards the style feature as a learnable parameter and
updates it by adversarial training. The learned adversarial style feature is
used to construct an adversarial image for robust model training. AdvStyle is
easy to implement and can be readily applied to different models. Experiments
on two synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that
AdvStyle can significantly improve the model performance on unseen real domains
and show that we can achieve the state of the art. Moreover, AdvStyle can be
employed to domain generalized image classification and produces a clear
improvement on the considered datasets.

recently gained increasing attention in the domain of machine learning and
information theory. They are widely used in generative models, fair machine
learning algorithms, design of privacy-assuring mechanisms, and appear as
information-theoretic performance bounds in various multi-user communication
problems. In this work, we propose a general family of optimization problems,
termed as complexity-leakage-utility bottleneck (CLUB) model, which (i)
provides a unified theoretical framework that generalizes most of the
state-of-the-art literature for the information-theoretic privacy models, (ii)
establishes a new interpretation of the popular generative and discriminative
models, (iii) constructs new insights to the generative compression models, and
(iv) can be used in the fair generative models. We first formulate the CLUB
model as a complexity-constrained privacy-utility optimization problem. We then
connect it with the closely related bottleneck problems, namely information
bottleneck (IB), privacy funnel (PF), deterministic IB (DIB), conditional
entropy bottleneck (CEB), and conditional PF (CPF). We show that the CLUB model
generalizes all these problems as well as most other information-theoretic
privacy models. Then, we construct the deep variational CLUB (DVCLUB) models by
employing neural networks to parameterize variational approximations of the
associated information quantities. Building upon these information quantities,
we present unified objectives of the supervised and unsupervised DVCLUB models.
Leveraging the DVCLUB model in an unsupervised setup, we then connect it with
state-of-the-art generative models, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs),
generative adversarial networks (GANs), as well as the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN),
Wasserstein auto-encoder (WAE), and adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) models
through the optimal transport (OT) problem. We then show that the DVCLUB model
can also be used in fair representation learning problems, where the goal is to
mitigate the undesired bias during the training phase of a machine learning

a central pattern generator (CPG) system with the Matsuoka oscillators for
generating stable and diverse locomotion patterns. Based on the proposed

Such maneuverability can be mapped into the control of oscillation patterns of

the Matsuoka CPG system, this work shows that the key to realizing the free
mobility of our soft snake robot is to properly constrain and control certain

two- and three-level systems analytically and numerically. We show a coherent
destruction tunneling effect in a lotuslike multipeak spectrum with a Floquet
two-level system, where the intensity of the probe field is periodically
modulated with a square-wave sequence. We demonstrate that the multipeak split
into multiple transparency windows with tunable quantum interference if the

phenomenological analysis with Akaike information criterion, we show that the

an extra degree of freedom to control the quantum interference provided by the

still facing is scalability in terms of throughput, typically limited to a few
transactions per second. A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the
propagation latency of blocks through the underlying peer-to-peer network,
which is typically constructed by means of random connectivity. Disseminating
blocks fast improves not only the transaction throughput, but also the security
of the system as it reduces the probability of forks. In this paper we present
CougaR: a simple yet efficient, eclipse-resistant, decentralized protocol that
substantially reduces the block dissemination time in blockchain networks.
CougaR's key advantages stem from its link selection policy, which combines a
network latency criterion with randomness to offer fast and reliable block
dissemination to the entire network. Moreover, CougaR is eclipse-resistant by
design, as nodes are protected from having all their links directly or
indirectly imposed on them by others, which is the typical vulnerability
exploited to deploy eclipse attacks. We rigorously evaluate CougaR by an
extensive set of experiments, both against a wide spectrum of parameter
settings, and in comparison to the current state of the art.

W, and the members of M only have preferences over the members of W and vice
versa. It is usually assumed that each member of M and W is a single entity.
However, there are many cases in which each member of M or W represents a team
that consists of several individuals with common interests. For example,
students may need to be matched to professors for their final projects, but
each project is carried out by a team of students. Thus, the students first
form teams, and the matching is between teams of students and professors.
  When a team is considered as an agent from M or W, it needs to have a
preference order that represents it. A voting rule is a natural mechanism for
aggregating the preferences of the team members into a single preference order.
In this paper, we investigate the problem of strategic voting in the context of
stable-matching of teams. Specifically, we assume that members of each team use
the Borda rule for generating the preference order of the team. Then, the
Gale-Shapley algorithm is used for finding a stable-matching, where the set M
is the proposing side. We show that the single-voter manipulation problem can
be solved in polynomial time, both when the team is from M and when it is from
W. We show that the coalitional manipulation problem is computationally hard,
but it can be solved approximately both when the team is from M and when it is
from W.

In this research, we consider the scenario where different domain shifts occur
among conditional distributions of different classes across domains. When
labeled samples in the source domains are limited, existing approaches are not
sufficiently robust. To address this problem, we propose a novel domain
generalization framework called Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Domain
Generalization (WDRDG), inspired by the concept of distributionally robust
optimization. We encourage robustness over conditional distributions within
class-specific Wasserstein uncertainty sets and optimize the worst-case
performance of a classifier over these uncertainty sets. We further develop a
test-time adaptation module leveraging optimal transport to quantify the
relationship between the unseen target domain and source domains to make
adaptive inference for target data. Experiments on the Rotated MNIST, PACS and
the VLCS datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively balance the
robustness and discriminability in challenging generalization scenarios.

grueling challenges they present for robotic autonomy. Due to their geometric
complexity, degraded perceptual conditions combined with lack of GPS support,
austere navigation conditions, and denied communications, subterranean settings
render autonomous operations particularly demanding. In response to this

legged and flying robots, coupled with robust control especially for overcoming
perilous terrain, multi-modal and multi-robot perception for localization and
mapping in conditions of sensor degradation, and resilient autonomy through
unified exploration path planning and local motion planning that reflects
robot-specific limitations. Based on its ability to explore diverse underground

this paper, we present a system where instability provides a crucial benefit.
We consider multi-agent collision avoidance using Control Barrier Functions
(CBF) and study trade-offs between safety and liveness -- the ability to reach
a destination without large detours or gridlock. We compare two standard
decentralized policies, with only the local (host) control available, to
co-optimization policies (PCCA and CCS) where everyone's (virtual) control
action is available. The co-optimization policies compute control for everyone
even though they lack information about others' intentions. For comparison, we
use a Centralized, full information policy as the benchmark. One contribution
of this paper is proving feasibility for the Centralized, PCCA, and CCS
policies. Monte Carlo simulations show that decentralized, host-only control
policies and CCS lack liveness while the PCCA policy performs as well as the
Centralized. Next, we explain the observed results by considering two agents
negotiating the passing order through an intersection. We show that the
structure and stability of the resulting equilibria correlates with the
observed propensity to gridlock -- the policies with unstable equilibria avoid
gridlocks while those with stable ones do not.

the entropy level at the earth's surface, apparently contrary to the second law
of thermodynamics. We have found that this requires new physics to explain it.
Another little known property of light, is that it makes it possible to detect
magnetic monopoles. We present evidence, from the scientific literature, that
magnetic monopoles have already been observed at low energies, but they are
non-objective, possibly in another space-time, and have been ignored. Several
experimentalists have shown that \textit{magnetic monopoles only exist in the
presence of intense illumination} and so do not seem to exist in their own
right. Mikhailov made repeated measurements and determined that the monopole
charge is quantized as predicted by Dirac ($g=ng_D, n$=1-5); ($\bar{g}$ = (0.99
$\pm$ 0.05)$g_D$). These results are reproducible, and so should be considered
physically real. We conclude that Dirac monopoles exist, however not in 4-D,
but in another space-time. In the second part we bring together two theories to
explain how light can switch (via the Brittin and Gamow effect) into another
space-time predicted by chronometric invariant general relativity (CIGR), to
reveal phenomena there. Light lowers the entropy level and so reverses the
arrow of time into the mirror world of CIGR, where time is directed from the
future to the past, and \textit{reveals} monopoles there. We call this the
photo-mirror effect. This explains the infinite length of Dirac's string. These
results are preliminary evidence for unification.

X-ray disk reprocessing accounts for the full variability properties of this

show that our model can reproduce its PSD in different epochs, establishing the
feasibility of using PSD modelling to investigate the time evolution of a

with common sense, and may be difficult to explain to non-experts. Thus to
appreciate the significance of a one-degree increase in global mean

global warming is forming a very large pool of excess energy that could in

arguments presented here are sufficiently simple to be presented in

that even a seemingly small increase in global mean temperature can potentially
lead to extreme weather events.

above structural theorem as follows: we identify a (parameterized) graph
$H_{t}$, called shallow vortex grid, and we prove that if in the above
structural theorem we replace $K_{t}$ by $H_{t},$ then the resulting
decomposition becomes ""vortex-free"". Up to now, the most general classes of

called single-crossing minor-free graphs. Our result is tight in the sense
that, whenever we minor-exclude a graph that is not a minor of some $H_{t},$
the appearance of vortices is unavoidable. Using the above decomposition
theorem, we design an algorithm that, given an $H_{t}$-minor-free graph $G$,
computes the generating function of all perfect matchings of $G$ in polynomial
time. This algorithm yields, on $H_{t}$-minor-free graphs, polynomial
algorithms for computational problems such as the {dimer problem, the exact
matching problem}, and the computation of the permanent. Our results, combined
with known complexity results, imply a complete characterization of
minor-closed graphs classes where the number of perfect matchings is

contain every $H_{t}$ as a minor. This provides a sharp complexity dichotomy
for the problem of counting perfect matchings in minor-closed classes.

series have to be merged. Climate models can be better validated using such
long TSI time series which can also help to provide stronger constraints on

3-step method based on data fusion, including a stochastic noise model to take
into account short and long-term correlations. Compared with previous products
scaled at the nominal TSI value of 1361 W/m2, the difference is below 0.2 W/m2

TSI composite time series with a Generalized Gauss-Markov model to help
describe an observed flattening at high frequencies. It allows us to fit a
linear trend into these TSI time series by joint inversion with the stochastic
noise model via a maximum-likelihood estimator. Our results show that the
amplitude of such trend is $\sim$ -0.004 +/- 0.004 W/(m2yr) for the period 1980

  proofs",,,,,"cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computing lower and upper bounds on the competitive ratio of online
algorithms is a challenging question: For a minimization combinatorial problem,
proving a competitive ratio for a given algorithm leads to an upper bound.
However computing lower bounds requires a proof on all algorithms. This can be
modeled as a 2-player game where a strategy for one of the players is a proof
for the lower bound. The tree representing the proof can can be found
computationally. This method has been used with success on the online bin
stretching problem where a set of items must be packed online in $m$ bins. The
items are guaranteed to fit into the $m$ bins. However, the online procedure
might require to stretch the bins to a larger capacity in order to be able to
pack all the items. This stretching factor is the objective to be minimized. We
propose original ideas to strongly improve the speed of computer searches for
lower bound: propagate the game states that can be pruned from the search and
improve the speed and memory usage in the dynamic program which is used in the
search. These improvements allowed to increase significantly the speed of the
search and hence to prove new lower bounds for the bin stretching problem for
6, 7 and 8 bins.

neural networks has attracted continuing studies for the theoretical principles
behind its success. A recent work uncovered a generic inverse variance-flatness
(IVF) relation between the variance of neural weights and the landscape
flatness of loss function near solutions under SGD [Feng & Tu, PNAS 118,0027
(2021)]. To investigate this seemly violation of statistical principle, we
deploy a stochastic decomposition to analyze the dynamical properties of SGD.
The method constructs the true ""energy"" function which can be used by Boltzmann
distribution. The new energy differs from the usual cost function and explains
the IVF relation under SGD. We further verify the scaling relation identified
in Feng's work. Our approach may bridge the gap between the classical
statistical mechanics and the emerging discipline of artificial intelligence,
with potential for better algorithm to the latter.

Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group (WC-RG) -- proceeds scale by scale,
estimating models for the conditional probabilities of ""fast degrees of
freedom"" conditioned by coarse-grained fields. These probability distributions
are modeled by energy functions associated with scale interactions, and are
represented in an orthogonal wavelet basis. WC-RG decomposes the microscopic
energy function as a sum of interaction energies at all scales and can
efficiently generate new samples by going from coarse to fine scales. Near
phase transitions, it avoids the ""critical slowing down"" of direct estimation
and sampling algorithms. This is explained theoretically by combining results
from RG and wavelet theories, and verified numerically for the Gaussian and
$\varphi^4$ field theories. We show that multiscale WC-RG energy-based models
are more general than local potential models and can capture the physics of
complex many-body interacting systems at all length scales. This is
demonstrated for weak-gravitational-lensing fields reflecting dark matter
distributions in cosmology, which include long-range interactions with
long-tail probability distributions. WC-RG has a large number of potential
applications in non-equilibrium systems, where the underlying distribution is
not known {\it a priori}. Finally, we discuss the connection between WC-RG and

IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed astrophysical neutrinos but has not
yet identified their sources. Blazars are promising source candidates, but
previous searches for neutrino emission from populations of blazars detected in
$\gtrsim$ GeV gamma-rays have not observed any significant neutrino excess.
Recent findings in multi-messenger astronomy indicate that high-energy photons,
co-produced with high-energy neutrinos, are likely to be absorbed and reemitted
at lower energies. Thus, lower-energy photons may be better indicators of
TeV-PeV neutrino production. This paper presents the first time-integrated
stacking search for astrophysical neutrino emission from MeV-detected blazars
in the first Fermi-LAT low energy catalog (1FLE) using ten years of IceCube
muon-neutrino data. The results of this analysis are found to be consistent
with a background-only hypothesis. Assuming an E$^{-2}$ neutrino spectrum and
proportionality between the blazars' MeV gamma-ray fluxes and TeV-PeV neutrino
flux, the upper limit on the 1FLE blazar energy-scaled neutrino flux is
determined to be $1.64 \times 10^{-12}$ TeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 90%
confidence level. This upper limit is approximately 1% of IceCube's diffuse
muon-neutrino flux measurement.

for machine learning models is laborious, time consuming, at times inaccurate,

work, we curate a silver standard dataset using weak supervision. In order to
validate its utility, we train machine learning models on the weakly supervised
data to identify three different types of natural disasters i.e earthquakes,
hurricanes and floods. Our results demonstrate that models trained on the
silver standard dataset achieved performance greater than 90% when classifying
a manually curated, gold-standard dataset. To enable reproducible research and
additional downstream utility, we release the silver standard dataset for the

Four types of polarons are identified, all inducing upward local band bending,

local lattice distortions. First principles calculations unveil three types of

however, are driven by conventional lattice distortions. All the four types of

strong or weak. In cavity quantum electrodynamics for example, when the
coupling strength is larger than the loss rate the coupling is termed strong,
and otherwise it is dubbed weak. Ultrastrong coupling, where the interaction
energy is of the same order of magnitude as the bare energies of the uncoupled
objects, presents a new paradigm for quantum physics and beyond. As a
consequence profound changes to well established phenomena occur, for instance
the ground state in an ultrastrongly coupled system is not empty but hosts
virtual excitations due to the existence of processes which do not conserve the
total number of excitations. The implications of ultrastrong coupling for
quantum topological systems, where the number of excitations are typically
conserved, remain largely unknown despite the great utility of topological
matter. Here we reveal how the delicate interplay between ultrastrong coupling
and topological states manifests in a one-dimensional array. We study
theoretically a dimerized chain of twolevel systems within the ultrastrong
coupling regime, where the combined saturation and counter-rotating terms in
the Hamiltonian are shown to play pivotal roles in the rich, multi-excitation
effective bandstructure. In particular, we uncover unusual topological edge
states, we introduce a flavour of topological state which we call an anti-edge
state, and we reveal the remarkable geometric-dependent renormalizations of the
quantum vaccum. Taken together, our results provide a route map for
experimentalists to characterize and explore a prototypical system in the
emerging field of ultrastrong quantum topology.

near-optimal size-stretch trade-off using only $\operatorname{polylog}(n)$
update time [Baswana, Khurana, and Sarkar TALG'12; Forster and Goranci STOC'19;

adversary, even when we allow infinite time and only count recourse (i.e. the
number of edge changes per update in the maintained spanner), all previous
algorithms with stretch at most $\log^{5}(n)$ require at least $\Omega(n)$
amortized recourse [Ausiello, Franciosa, and Italiano ESA'05].
  In this paper, we completely close this gap with respect to recourse by
showing algorithms against an adaptive adversary with near-optimal size-stretch

maintains a $(2k-1)$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k}\log n)$ with $O(\log n)$
amortized recourse, which is optimal in all parameters up to a $O(\log n)$
factor. As a step toward algorithms with small update time (not just recourse),
we show another algorithm that maintains a $3$-spanner of size $\tilde
O(n^{1.5})$ with $\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ amortized recourse \emph{and}
simultaneously $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time.

and either forwards the header to the destination or back to the source. In
this way a low latency network that is largely lossless for metadata can be
built. Ideally, trimming would be implemented as a primitive in switch ASICs,
but hardware development cycles are slow, costly, and require demonstrated
customer demand. In this paper we investigate how trimming can be implemented
in existing programmable switches which were not designed with trimming in
mind, with a particular focus on a P4 implementation on the Tofino switch ASIC.
We show that it is indeed possible to closely approximate idealized trimming
and demonstrate that trimming can be integrated into a production-grade
datacenter switch software stack.

one example of such a network with exactly three species and four reactions was
previously known due to Wilhelm. In this paper, we develop both theory and
computational tools to fully classify three-species, four-reaction, bimolecular
CRNs, according to whether they admit or forbid Hopf bifurcation. We show that
there are, up to a natural equivalence, 86 minimal networks which admit
nondegenerate Hopf bifurcation. Amongst these, we are able to decide which
admit supercritical and subcritical bifurcations. Indeed, there are 25 networks
which admit both supercritical and subcritical bifurcations, and we can confirm
that all 25 admit a nondegenerate Bautin bifurcation. A total of 31 networks
can admit more than one nondegenerate periodic orbit. Moreover, 29 of these
networks admit the coexistence of a stable equilibrium with a stable periodic
orbit. Thus, fairly complex behaviours are not very rare in these small,
bimolecular networks. Finally, we can use previously developed theory on the
inheritance of dynamical behaviours in CRNs to predict the occurrence of Hopf
bifurcation in larger networks which include the networks we find here as

edges and paths is frequently encountered in observational studies. The shared

directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). In this paper, we first provide a sound and
complete graphical characterization of causal MPDAGs and give a minimal
representation of a causal MPDAG. Then, we introduce a novel representation
called direct causal clause (DCC) to represent all types of causal background

objects in heterogeneous graphs, which consist of different types of objects
and different types of links. In real-world scenarios, new semantic relations
constantly emerge and they typically appear with only a few labeled data. Since
a variety of semantic relations exist in multiple heterogeneous graphs, the
transferable knowledge can be mined from some existing semantic relations to
help predict the new semantic relations with few labeled data. This inspires a
novel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction across heterogeneous
graphs. However, the existing methods cannot solve this problem because they
not only require a large number of labeled samples as input, but also focus on
a single graph with a fixed heterogeneity. Targeting this novel and challenging
problem, in this paper, we propose a Meta-learning based Graph neural network
for Semantic relation prediction, named MetaGS. Firstly, MetaGS decomposes the
graph structure between objects into multiple normalized subgraphs, then adopts
a two-view graph neural network to capture local heterogeneous information and
global structure information of these subgraphs. Secondly, MetaGS aggregates
the information of these subgraphs with a hyper-prototypical network, which can
learn from existing semantic relations and adapt to new semantic relations.
Thirdly, using the well-initialized two-view graph neural network and
hyper-prototypical network, MetaGS can effectively learn new semantic relations
from different graphs while overcoming the limitation of few labeled data.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the
superior performance of MetaGS over the state-of-the-art methods.

knowledge learned from a set of labeled source domains, to an unlabeled target

shares the identical group of classes with the target domain, which could
hardly be guaranteed as the target label space is not observable. In this
paper, we consider a more versatile setting of MSDA, namely Generalized
Multi-source Domain Adaptation, wherein the source domains are partially
overlapped, and the target domain is allowed to contain novel categories that
are not presented in any source domains. This new setting is more elusive than
any existing domain adaptation protocols due to the coexistence of the domain
and category shifts across the source and target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a variational domain disentanglement (VDD) framework, which
decomposes the domain representations and semantic features for each instance
by encouraging dimension-wise independence. To identify the target samples of
unknown classes, we leverage online pseudo labeling, which assigns the
pseudo-labels to unlabeled target data based on the confidence scores.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets

environments are open and variable, for instance those found in autonomous
vehicles, it is therefore important to monitor their operational situation to
determine its distance from the ML components' trained scope. If that distance

outcome unreliable and switch to alternatives, e.g. using human operator input
instead. SafeML is a model-agnostic approach for performing such monitoring,
using distance measures based on statistical testing of the training and

scholars to systematically examine hypotheses on the interplay between text,
spoken realisation, and the listener's perception of poems. To meet these
special requirements for literary studies, we resynthesise poems by cloning
prosodic values from a human reference recitation, and afterwards make use of
fine-grained prosody control to manipulate the synthetic speech in a
human-in-the-loop setting to alter the recitation w.r.t. specific phenomena. We
find that finetuning our TTS model on poetry captures poetic intonation
patterns to a large extent which is beneficial for prosody cloning and
manipulation and verify the success of our approach both in an objective
evaluation as well as in human studies.

Although the traditional artificial neural network using fixed-length vectors

still a black box that lacks interpretability, far from how humans perceive the
world. Inspired by the grandmother-cell hypothesis in neuroscience, this work
investigates how population encoding and spiking timing-dependent plasticity

networks, and how a population of neurons can represent a symbol via guiding
the completion of sequential firing between different neuron populations. The
neuron populations of different communities together constitute the entire
commonsense knowledge graph, forming a giant graph spiking neural network.
Moreover, we introduced the Reward-modulated spiking timing-dependent
plasticity (R-STDP) mechanism to simulate the biological reinforcement learning
process and completed the related reasoning tasks accordingly, achieving
comparable accuracy and faster convergence speed than the graph convolutional
artificial neural networks. For the fields of neuroscience and cognitive
science, the work in this paper provided the foundation of computational
modeling for further exploration of the way the human brain represents

-- small perturbations that alter the output of the network and exist under
strict norm limitations. While such perturbations are usually discussed as
tailored to a specific input, a universal perturbation can be constructed to
alter the model's output on a set of inputs. Universal perturbations present a
more realistic case of adversarial attacks, as awareness of the model's exact
input is not required. In addition, the universal attack setting raises the
subject of generalization to unseen data, where given a set of inputs, the
universal perturbations aim to alter the model's output on out-of-sample data.
In this work, we study physical passive patch adversarial attacks on visual
odometry-based autonomous navigation systems. A visual odometry system aims to
infer the relative camera motion between two corresponding viewpoints, and is
frequently used by vision-based autonomous navigation systems to estimate their

severe security issue, as it can be used to mislead a system onto some

the error margin of a visual odometry model can be significantly increased by
deploying patch adversarial attacks in the scene. We provide evaluation on
synthetic closed-loop drone navigation data and demonstrate that a comparable

is applied to the important problem of deforestation and degradation in the

reversible, capable of reverting back to its original state through a heat
treatment. We design this behavior by constructing lattice structures using
networks of nonlinear springs that display tension-compression asymmetry and
have different thermal expansion coefficients. The mismatch in the thermal
expansion coefficients induces residual stresses in the springs which results
in the lattice structure exhibiting bistability at low temperatures and
monostability at high temperatures. This behavior mimics the crystallographic
phase transformations of shape memory alloys, but here artificially introduced
in a structural lattice. By analyzing a representative unit cell, we quantify
the effect that the stiffness and the thermal expansion coefficient of the
springs have on the stability of the structural lattice. In addition, for
simple 2D lattices, using the concept of universal unfoldings of singularity
theory, we perform a perturbation analysis to identify the key variables of the
structure where controlling defects is important, as they lead to drastic
changes in the bifurcation behavior of the lattice. Finally, we verify
numerically our analytical predictions in both 2D and 3D simulations using
continuation techniques. The examples proposed confirm that the bistable and
reversible features of the unit cell carry on to the macroscale, opening the
route for the design of lattice structures for energy absorption applications

gives rise to the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on
the connectionist paradigm: The brain's entire knowledge and thinking skills
are thought to be stored in the connections; and the mental operations are
executed by network computations. I propose here an alternative paradigm: Our
knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G
protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be
executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICs. As GPGICs have the capacity to
close or open branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states
transiently re-route neural activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs
detect ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs
transiently selects a subnetwork within the brain. The process of selecting
this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation -- be it in a form
of directed attention, perception of a grandmother or making a decision.
Synaptic connections and network computations play only a secondary role,
supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new paradigm, the mind emerges
within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose primary function is to
continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be allowed to
pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of
intelligence from which the connectionism paradigm suffers.

various magnetospheric regions under, inside, and outside of the Van Allen
inner and outer electron radiation belts in May 2009. The study is based on the
experimental data obtained from the STEP-F and the SphinX instruments placed
close to each other aboard the low-Earth circular orbit CORONAS-Photon
satellite. Data analysis of particle fluencies collected from the highly
sensitive STEP-F device indicates the presence of a persistent electron belt at
L = 1.6, i.e., beneath the well-known Van Allen electron inner radiation belt
of the Earth's magnetosphere. The electron energy spectrum in this 'new' belt
is much steeper than that of the inner belt so that the electrons with energies
Ee > 400 keV were almost not recorded on L = 1.6 outside the South Atlantic
Anomaly (SAA). We introduce the concept of effective lowest threshold energies
for X-ray detectors used in the solar soft X-ray spectrophotometer SphinX and
define their values for two regions: the SAA and the Van Allen outer belt.
Different values of lowest threshold energies are directly associated with
different slopes of particle energy spectra. Cross-analyses of data obtained
from the STEP-F and SphinX instruments initially built for various purposes
made it possible to detect the highly anisotropic character of the spatial
electron distribution in radiation belts in both Southern and northern
hemispheres. We detected also the presence of low-energy electrons at all
latitudes during the main phase of a weak geomagnetic storm.

  Antennas",,,,,"physics.app-ph cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present the design of a phased, modulated, power distribution network for
metasurface array antennas. The specific metasurface array design comprises a
series of waveguides, each feeding a sub-array of dynamically tunable
metamaterial elements that radiate at microwave (X-band) frequencies. To remain
a one-port device, the composite array requires a power divider that can excite
each branch waveguide with equal power. Further, the power divider must also
apply a prescribed phase shift to each branch waveguide to mitigate
metasurface-specific grating lobes. The presented design features hollow metal
waveguides, with a conducting sheet patterned with metamaterial irises serving
as the upper wall. A single hollow metal main waveguide feed is used to couple
power to each of the branch waveguide. Carefully oriented slots control both
the magnitude and phase of the field distributed from the main feed to each
branch. All waveguides can be machined from a single block of metal, with a
metamaterial-patterned printed circuit board laminated to the top of the
assembly. The resulting design is mechanically robust and capable of high power
operation while retaining the low-cost, low-power consumption, lightweight, and
low-profile features common in metasurface antenna designs.

(explicitly or implicitly) only on Schroedinger's equation - that explains why
a single alpha particle emitted in a single spherically symmetric s-wave
nuclear decay produces a manifestly non-spherically-symmetric single track in a
cloud chamber? This is a variant of the more general quantum measurement
problem. Earlier, we proposed such a mechanism, drawing on quantum-mechanical
Coulomb scattering and the thermal behavior of supersaturated vapors. Our
analysis implied that, in a large enough sample, the probability that a track
originates at distance R from the decay source is proportional to 1/R^2, with a
proportionality constant which we expressed in terms of more fundamental
parameters involving diverse physical processes, but were unable to estimate at
the time. More recently, we tested the 1/R^2 law opportunistically using
pedagogical cloud chamber video posted on the Internet. In the present paper,
we draw on the chemical physics literature for an independent estimate of the
proportionality constant. The estimate is rough, but within about 1.7 orders of
magnitude (factor of 50) of a rough value that we derive directly from the
video data. Given the crudeness of the experimental data, the roughness of the
numerical estimates, and the extreme spread of concentrations involved (air
molecules vs. subcritical vapor clusters of specific sizes), we view this level
of agreement as significant, at this stage in the theory's development.
