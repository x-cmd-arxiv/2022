including economics, industry, jurisprudence, and artificial intelligence,
where each player only cares about its own interest in a noncooperative or
cooperative manner, but without obvious malice to other players. However, in
many practical applications, such as poker, chess, evader pursuing, drug
interdiction, coast guard, cyber-security, and national defense, players often
have apparently adversarial stances, that is, selfish actions of each player
inevitably or intentionally inflict loss or wreak havoc on other players. Along
this line, this paper provides a systematic survey on three main game models
widely employed in adversarial games, i.e., zero-sum normal-form and
extensive-form games, Stackelberg (security) games, zero-sum differential
games, from an array of perspectives, including basic knowledge of game models,
(approximate) equilibrium concepts, problem classifications, research
frontiers, (approximate) optimal strategy seeking techniques, prevailing
algorithms, and practical applications. Finally, promising future research
directions are also discussed for relevant adversarial games.

digital images, videos and audio. Recently, watermarking methods have been
extended to deep learning models -- in principle, the watermark should be
preserved when an adversary tries to copy the model. However, in practice,
watermarks can often be removed by an intelligent adversary. Several papers
have proposed watermarking methods that claim to be empirically resistant to
different types of removal attacks, but these new techniques often fail in the
face of new or better-tuned adversaries. In this paper, we propose a
certifiable watermarking method. Using the randomized smoothing technique
proposed in Chiang et al., we show that our watermark is guaranteed to be
unremovable unless the model parameters are changed by more than a certain l2
threshold. In addition to being certifiable, our watermark is also empirically
more robust compared to previous watermarking methods. Our experiments can be

large-scale labeled compound expression data for training. However, collecting
such data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we address the
compound FER task in the cross-domain few-shot learning (FSL) setting, which
requires only a few samples of compound expressions in the target domain.
Specifically, we propose a novel cascaded decomposition network (CDNet), which
cascades several learn-to-decompose modules with shared parameters based on a
sequential decomposition mechanism, to obtain a transferable feature space. To
alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited base classes in our task, a
partial regularization strategy is designed to effectively exploit the best of
both episodic training and batch training. By training across similar tasks on
multiple basic expression datasets, CDNet learns the ability of
learn-to-decompose that can be easily adapted to identify unseen compound
expressions. Extensive experiments on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound
expression datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CDNet against
several state-of-the-art FSL methods. Code is available at:

first using tissue-mimicking liquids and then in a recently deceased ex vivo
porcine model. The minimum change in the phase between different

changes in the phase, provide sufficient information to follow the position of
the capsule in the gastrointestinal tract.

randomly generated reservoir and a small number of readout connections trained
via linear regression. The most common topology of the reservoir is a fully
connected network of up to thousands of neurons. Over the years, researchers
have introduced a variety of alternative reservoir topologies, such as a
circular network or a linear path of connections. When comparing the
performance of different topologies or other architectural changes, it is
necessary to tune the hyperparameters for each of the topologies separately
since their properties may significantly differ. The hyperparameter tuning is
usually carried out manually by selecting the best performing set of parameters
from a sparse grid of predefined combinations. Unfortunately, this approach may
lead to underperforming configurations, especially for sensitive topologies. We
propose an alternative approach of hyperparameter tuning based on the
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Using this approach,
we have improved multiple topology comparison results by orders of magnitude
suggesting that topology alone does not play as important role as properly
tuned hyperparameters.

improve the decisions that are made either during the trial or at its end.
Establishing decision criteria ahead of the study is essential here to address
the need for speedy decisions, potentially in real time. At the project level,
QDM can be used to inform decisions to continue, adapt or stop a drug
development programme based on results from previous studies. At the portfolio
level, QDM can be used to choose, prioritise and optimise the development
portfolio, e.g. using the probability to reach market access or target sales
within a predefined timeline. The increasing interest in QDM and its
statistical nature led in 2017 to the development a cross-industry and academia
Special Interest Group on QDM within the Society and the European Federation of
Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (PSI and EFSPI). The activities of
the group included discussing QDM examples, some published in the literature
and some real anonymised ones covering several settings. While the
methodologies, and to some extent the terminology, employed also varied

to distinguish the interaction between a human-object pair. Attention based

current methods execute relation parsing in a ""bottom-up"" manner. We argue that
the independent use of the bottom-up parsing strategy in HOI is
counter-intuitive and could lead to the diffusion of attention. Therefore, we
introduce a novel knowledge-guided top-down attention into HOI, and propose to
model the relation parsing as a ""look and search"" process: execute
scene-context modeling (i.e. look), and then, given the knowledge of the target
pair, search visual clues for the discrimination of the interaction between the
pair. We implement the process via unifying the bottom-up and top-down
attention in a single encoder-decoder based model. The experimental results

in this paper is to propose classes of rules for indivisible PB with weak
rankings (i.e., weak ordinal preferences) and investigate their key algorithmic

significance and motivation. The first is layered approval rules which enable
weak rankings to be studied by carefully translating them into approval votes.
The second is need-based rules which enable to capture fairness issues. Under
layered approval rules, we study two natural families of rules:
greedy-truncation rules and cost-worthy rules. The paper has two parts. In the
first part, we investigate algorithmic and complexity related issues for the
proposed rules. In the second part, we present a detailed axiomatic analysis of
these rules, for which, we examine and generalize axioms in the literature and

  We give the first polynomial time algorithm for STAP with approximation ratio

Construction and characterization of social choice rules in the single-peaked
domain has been extensively studied in prior works. In fact, in the
single-peaked domain, it is known that unanimous and strategy-proof
deterministic rules have to be min-max rules and those that also satisfy
anonymity have to be median rules. Further, random social choice rules
satisfying these properties have been shown to be convex combinations of
respective deterministic rules. We non-trivially add to this body of results by
including fairness considerations in social choice. Our study directly
addresses fairness for groups of agents. To study group-fairness, we consider
an existing partition of the agents into logical groups, based on natural
attributes such as gender, race, and location. To capture fairness within each
group, we introduce the notion of group-wise anonymity. To capture fairness
across the groups, we propose a weak notion as well as a strong notion of
fairness. The proposed fairness notions turn out to be natural generalizations
of existing individual-fairness notions and moreover provide non-trivial
outcomes for strict ordinal preferences, unlike the existing group-fairness
notions. We provide two separate characterizations of random social choice
rules that satisfy group-fairness: (i) direct characterization (ii) extreme
point characterization (as convex combinations of fair deterministic social
choice rules). We also explore the special case where there are no groups and
provide sharper characterizations of rules that achieve individual-fairness.

  Parallel Debugging",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The clustering technique has attracted a lot of attention as a promising
strategy for parallel debugging in multi-fault scenarios, this heuristic
approach (i.e., failure indexing or fault isolation) enables developers to
perform multiple debugging tasks simultaneously through dividing failed test
cases into several disjoint groups. When using statement ranking representation
to model failures for better clustering, several factors influence clustering
effectiveness, including the risk evaluation formula (REF), the number of
faults (NOF), the fault type (FT), and the number of successful test cases
paired with one individual failed test case (NSP1F). In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive empirical study of how these four factors influence
clustering effectiveness. We conduct extensive controlled experiments on 1060
faulty versions of 228 simulated faults and 141 real faults, and the results
reveal that: 1) GP19 is highly competitive across all REFs, 2) clustering
effectiveness decreases as NOF increases, 3) higher clustering effectiveness is
easier to achieve when a program contains only predicate faults, and 4)
clustering effectiveness remains when the scale of NSP1F is reduced to 20%.

modern proof-of-stake consensus protocols, such as Algorand. In cryptographic
self-selection, each round $r$ has a seed $Q_r$. In round $r$, each account
owner is asked to digitally sign $Q_r$, hash their digital signature to produce
a credential, and then broadcast this credential to the entire network. A
publicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the
distribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution
of stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring
credential is the leader for round $r$, and their credential becomes the seed
$Q_{r+1}$. Such protocols leave open the possibility of a selfish-mining style
attack: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring
credentials in round $r$ can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in
order to influence the seed for round $r+1$. Indeed, the user can pre-compute
their credentials for round $r+1$ for each potential seed, and broadcast only
the credential (among those with a low enough score to be the leader) that
produces the most favorable seed.
  We consider an adversary who wishes to maximize the expected fraction of
rounds in which an account they own is the leader. We show such an adversary
always benefits from deviating from the intended protocol, regardless of the
fraction of the stake controlled. We characterize the optimal strategy; first
by proving the existence of optimal positive recurrent strategies whenever the
adversary owns last than $38\%$ of the stake. Then, we provide a Markov
Decision Process formulation to compute the optimal strategy.

underlying 'static allocation' linear program (LP) is critical, but does not
require that it has a unique solution. The main result is the construction of
policies that asymptotically achieve a lower bound, proved in [1], on an
expected discounted linear combination of diffusion-scaled queue lengths, and
are therefore asymptotically optimal (AO).
  Each extreme point solution to the LP determines a control mode, i.e., a set
of activities (class--server pairs) that are operational.
  When there are multiple solutions, these modes can be selected dynamically.
It is shown that the number of modes required for AO is either one or two. In
the latter case there is a switching point in the (normalized) workload domain,
characterized in terms of a free boundary problem.
  Our policies are defined by identifying pairs of elementary policies and
switching between them at this switching point.
  They provide the first example in the heavy traffic literature where weak
limits under an AO policy are given by a diffusion process where both the drift
and diffusion coefficients are discontinuous.

examples for polytopes whose Ehrhart polynomial roots come close to this bound.
In the case of polytopes which have their roots on the critical line, we
present an improved bound. As a side effect this confirms a special case of a

actual or fictive, novel experiences. To do so, we separate our experiences
into fundamental atomic components. These atomic components can then be
recombined in novel ways to support our ability to imagine and engage with
novel experiences. We frame this as the ability to learn to generalise
compositionally. And, we will refer to behaviours making use of this ability as
compositional learning behaviours (CLBs).
  A central problem to learning CLBs is the resolution of a binding problem
(BP) (by learning to, firstly, segregate the supportive stimulus components
from the observation of multiple stimuli, and then, combine them in a single
episodic experience). While it is another feat of intelligence that human
beings perform with ease, it is not the case for state-of-the-art artificial
agents.
  Thus, in order to build artificial agents able to collaborate with human
beings, we propose to develop a novel benchmark to investigate agents'
abilities to exhibit CLBs by solving a domain-agnostic version of the BP. We
take inspiration from the language emergence and grounding framework of
referential games and propose a meta-learning extension of referential games,
entitled Meta-Referential Games, and use this framework to build our benchmark,
that we name Symbolic Behaviour Benchmark (S2B).
  While it has the potential to test for more symbolic behaviours, rather than
solely CLBs, in the present paper, though, we solely focus on the single-agent
language grounding task that tests for CLBs. We provide baseline results for
it, using state-of-the-art RL agents, and show that our proposed benchmark is a
compelling challenge that we hope will spur the research community towards
developing more capable artificial agents.

Southern galaxies with B < 11.2 and |b| > 15 degrees. We verified that $23\%
\pm 4\%$ of the galaxies show nuclear emission-line properties characteristic
of Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Regions (LINERs). Diagnostic diagram
analysis reveals an apparent dichotomy, not detected in previous studies,
between objects classified as H II regions and as LINERs or Seyferts, with very
few galaxies classified as transition objects. A possible explanation for this
result is that at least part of the transition objects are composite systems,
with a central LINER contaminated by the emission from circumnuclear H II
regions. The higher spatial resolution of the DIVING$^\mathrm{3D}$ survey, in
comparison with previous studies, allowed us to isolate the nuclear emission
from circumnuclear contaminations, reducing the number of transition objects.
We also propose an alternative scenario, in which the emission-line spectra of
some transition objects are the result of shock heating by central outflows,
together with photoionization by young stars. Clear evidence of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), in the optical and X-ray spectral bands, were detected in 69$\%$
of the LINERs in the mini-DIVING$^\mathrm{3D}$ sample. Considering the entire
mini-DIVING$^\mathrm{3D}$ sample, evidence of AGNs were detected in 65$\%$ of

complexity in the collaborative learning model with non-IID data, where
multiple agents interact with possibly different environments and they want to
learn an objective in the aggregated environment. We use a basic problem in
bandit theory called best arm identification in multi-armed bandits as a
vehicle to deliver the following conceptual message: collaborative learning on
non-IID data is provably more difficult than that on IID data. In particular,
we show the following: 1) Learning time speedup in the non-IID data setting can
be much smaller than $1$ (that is, a slowdown). When the number of rounds $R =
O(1)$, we will need at least a polynomial number of agents (in terms of the
number of arms) to achieve a speedup $\tilde{\Omega}(1)$. This is in stark
contrast to the IID data setting, where the speedup is always
$\tilde{\Omega}(1)$ regardless of $R$ and the number of agents $K$. 2) Local
adaptivity of the agents cannot help much in the non-IID data setting. This is
in contrast with the IID data setting, in which to achieve the same speedup,
the best non-adaptive algorithm requires a significantly larger number of
rounds than the best adaptive algorithm.

a conformal dose. We describe a new framework for optimization of filter design
and spot maps to meet the unique demands of FLASH radiotherapy. We demonstrate
an Integrated Biological Optimization IMPT (IBO-IMPT) approach for optimization
of dose, dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), and dose-averaged LET (LETd). Methods:
We developed inverse planning software to design patient-specific ridge filters
that spread the Bragg peak from a fixed-energy, 250 MeV beam to a proximal
beam-specific planning target volume. The software optimizes patient-specific
ridge filter and uses a Monte Carlo calculation engine, based on Geant4, to
provide dose and LET influence matrices. Plan optimization, using matRAD,
accommodates the IBO-IMPT objective function considering dose, dose rate, and
LET simultaneously with minimum MU constraints. The framework enables design of
both regularly spaced and sparse-optimized ridge filters, which allow faster
delivery and selective LET optimization. Volume distributions and histograms
for dose, DADR, and LETd are compared using evaluation structures specific to
the heart and lung. Results: We used IBO-IMPT to design ridge filters for a
central lung tumor patient. The IBO-IMPT framework selectively spared heart and
lung by reducing LET and increasing dose rate, relative to IMPT planning.
Sparse-optimized ridge filters were superior to regularly spaced ridge filters
in dose rate. Together, these innovations substantially increased the DADR in
the heart and lung while maintaining good target coverage. The volume that
received a FLASH dose rate of higher 40 Gy/second increased by 31% for heart
and 50% for lung. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the
feasibility of using an IBO-IMPT framework to accomplish proton FLASH SBPT,

of the minimum length $ M(H,k,q) $ of an $ [n,k]_q $-MWS code remains an open
problem. The current work broadens discussion first to general coordinate-wise
weight functions, and then specifically to the Lee weight and a Manhattan like
weight. In the general case we provide bounds on $ n $ for which an FWS code
exists, and bounds on $ n $ for which an MWS code exists. When specializing to
the Lee or to the Manhattan setting we are able to completely determine the
parameters of FWS codes. As with the Hamming case, we are able to provide an
upper bound on $ M(\mathcal{L},k,q) $ (the minimum length of Lee MWS codes),
and pose the determination of $ M(\mathcal{L},k,q) $ as an open problem. On the
other hand, with respect to the Manhattan weight we completely determine the
parameters of MWS codes.

PCA (PerPCA), which uses mutually orthogonal global and local principal
components to encode both unique and shared features. We show that, under mild
conditions, both unique and shared features can be identified and recovered by
a constrained optimization problem, even if the covariance matrices are
immensely different. Also, we design a fully federated algorithm inspired by
distributed Stiefel gradient descent to solve the problem. The algorithm
introduces a new group of operations called generalized retractions to handle
orthogonality constraints, and only requires global PCs to be shared across
sources. We prove the linear convergence of the algorithm under suitable
assumptions. Comprehensive numerical experiments highlight PerPCA's superior
performance in feature extraction and prediction from heterogeneous datasets.
As a systematic approach to decouple shared and unique features from
heterogeneous datasets, PerPCA finds applications in several tasks including
video segmentation, topic extraction, and distributed clustering.

local minima, and suffers from location ambiguity due to insufficient number of
TOA measurements and/or poor geometry of anchors at a single epoch. A new
initialization method based on semidefinite programming (SDP), namely MEMA-SDP,
is first designed to address the initialization problem of the MEMA-TOA method.
Then, an iterative refinement step is developed to obtain the optimal

errors, making detection and repair difficult. Seeing as a systematic outlier
is a combination of patterns of a clean instance and systematic error patterns,

CLSVAE is effective with much less labelled data compared to previous related
models, often with less than 2% of the data. We provide experiments using three
image datasets in scenarios with different levels of corruption and labelled

consider the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the signal

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted to cope with the scarcity of

one dynamic long-term objective. Through each robot planning its path and
downlink power, the AP only needs to determine the phase shifts of the RIS,
which can significantly save the computation overhead due to the reduced
training dimension. Simulation results reveal the following findings: I) the
proposed F-DRL can reduce at least 86% convergence time compared to the

classification tasks where information on existing subclasses is available and
taken into consideration. In classification tasks with a small number of
classes or binary detection, the amount of information transferred from the
teacher to the student is restricted, thus limiting the utility of knowledge
distillation. Performance can be improved by leveraging information of possible
subclasses within the classes. To that end, we propose the so-called Subclass
Knowledge Distillation (SKD), a process of transferring the knowledge of
predicted subclasses from a teacher to a smaller student. Meaningful
information that is not in the teacher's class logits but exists in subclass
logits (e.g., similarities within classes) will be conveyed to the student
through the SKD, which will then boost the student's performance. Analytically,
we measure how much extra information the teacher can provide the student via
the SKD to demonstrate the efficacy of our work. The framework developed is
evaluated in clinical application, namely colorectal polyp binary
classification. It is a practical problem with two classes and a number of
subclasses per class. In this application, clinician-provided annotations are
used to define subclasses based on the annotation label's variability in a
curriculum style of learning. A lightweight, low-complexity student trained
with the SKD framework achieves an F1-score of 85.05%, an improvement of 1.47%,
and a 2.10% gain over the student that is trained with and without conventional
knowledge distillation, respectively. The 2.10% F1-score gap between students
trained with and without the SKD can be explained by the extra subclass
knowledge, i.e., the extra 0.4656 label bits per sample that the teacher can
transfer in our experiment.

in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the
topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite
electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it
is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic

predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity,

damping (absorbing conditions) to the boundary (free-end) of the lattice.
Compared to the 1D lattices with on-site potentials, the properties of discrete
breathers (DBs) that are spatially localized intrinsic modes are quite unusual
with the NNN couplings included, i.e., these DBs are mobile, and thus they can
interact with both the phonons and the boundaries of the lattice. For the
interparticle interactions of harmonic and Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\beta$
(FPUT-$\beta$) types, we find two crossovers of relaxation in general, i.e., a
first crossover from the stretched-exponential to the regular exponential
relaxation occurring in a short timescale, and a further crossover from the
exponential to the power-law relaxation taking place in a long timescale. The
first and second relaxations are universal, but the final power-law relaxation
is strongly influenced by the properties of DBs, e.g. the scattering processes
of DBs with phonons and boundaries in the FPUT-$\beta$ type systems make the
power-law decay relatively faster than that in the counterparts of the harmonic
type systems under the same coupling. Our results present new information and

sampling-based approaches for implementing Bayesian inference due to its
conceptual simplicity, statistical accuracy and computational scalability.
However, common variational approximation schemes, such as the mean-field (MF)
approximation, require certain conjugacy structure to facilitate efficient
computation, which may add unnecessary restrictions to the viable prior
distribution family and impose further constraints on the variational
approximation family. In this work, we develop a general computational
framework for implementing MF-VI via Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF), a
gradient flow over the space of probability measures. When specialized to
Bayesian latent variable models, we analyze the algorithmic convergence of an
alternating minimization scheme based on a time-discretized WGF for
implementing the MF approximation. In particular, the proposed algorithm
resembles a distributional version of EM algorithm, consisting of an E-step of
updating the latent variable variational distribution and an M-step of
conducting steepest descent over the variational distribution of parameters.
Our theoretical analysis relies on optimal transport theory and subdifferential
calculus in the space of probability measures. We prove the exponential
convergence of the time-discretized WGF for minimizing a generic objective
functional given strict convexity along generalized geodesics. We also provide
a new proof of the exponential contraction of the variational distribution
obtained from the MF approximation by using the fixed-point equation of the
time-discretized WGF. We apply our method and theory to two classic Bayesian
latent variable models, the Gaussian mixture model and the mixture of
regression model. Numerical experiments are also conducted to compliment the
theoretical findings under these two models.

insertions and deletions in the setting where we allow the approximation factor
$\alpha$ to be much larger than $1$. Such algorithms can use significantly less
memory than the usual setting for which $\alpha = 1+\epsilon$ for an $\epsilon

  For the $\ell_p$ norm/quasinorm $\|x\|_p$ of an $n$-dimensional vector $x$,
$0 < p \le 2$, we show that obtaining a $\poly(n)$-approximation requires the
same amount of memory as obtaining an $O(1)$-approximation for any $M =
n^{\Theta(1)}$.
  For estimating the $\ell_p$ norm, $p > 2$, we show an upper bound of
$O(n^{1-2/p} (\log n \allowbreak \log M)/\alpha^{2})$ bits for an
$\alpha$-approximation, and give a matching lower bound, for almost the full
range of $\alpha \geq 1$ for linear sketches.
  For the $\ell_2$-heavy hitters problem, we show that the known lower bound of
$\Omega(k \log n\log M)$ bits for identifying $(1/k)$-heavy hitters holds even
if we are allowed to output items that are $1/(\alpha k)$-heavy, for almost the
full range of $\alpha$, provided the algorithm succeeds with probability
$1-O(1/n)$. We also obtain a lower bound for linear sketches that is tight even

  For estimating the number $\ell_0$ of distinct elements, we give an

Fourier sum of squares (FSOS). We thoroughly study both the theoretical and
computational aspects of this problem. On the theoretical side, we prove two
existence theorems:
  (1) If $(L_{\min},L)$ lies in some regime, then any CNF formula with $m$
clauses of which at least $L_{\min}$ are falsified admits a polynomial FSOS
certificate for the existence of at most $(m-L)$ satisfiable clauses, whose

  (2) Any CNF formula with $m$ clauses admits a rational FSOS certificate for

  For computational purposes, we propose an efficient algorithm which is

desirable mechanical characteristics. Thus, in our present molecular dynamic
(MD) study we have explored the implication of PBF process thermal conditions
on the mechanical characteristics of FeNiCrCoCu HEA by systematically varying
laser scan speed from 0.4 {\AA}/ps to 0.1 {\AA}/ps, unidirectional and
reversing laser passes from 1 to 4, and laser power from 100 microwatts to 220
microwatts. Our investigation suggests that reducing the laser scanning speed
up to a critical velocity of 0.2 {\AA}/ps considerably improves mechanical
strengths, with further reduction creating severe surface defects. Decreased
ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is associated with the annihilation of the bulk
sessile dislocations during tensile straining marking an early yield failure.
Alternately, the material's strength could be improved by annealing with
several unidirectional laser passes over the same target region, resulting in
enhanced UTS due to subtler yield points. Increasing laser power aids in
ameliorating material density ultimately leading to higher UTS even in
non-dislocation-free structures. These findings will assist researchers to
understand the underlying effects and optimize process thermal parameters to

  arXiv:2206.13995",,,,"quant-ph cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Quantum error correction is fundamentally important for quantum information
processing and computation. Quantum error correction codes have been studied
and constructed since the pioneering papers of Shor and Steane. Optimal (called
MDS) $q$-qubit quantum codes attaining the quantum Singleton bound were
constructed for very restricted lengths $n \leq q^2+1$. Entanglement-assisted
quantum error correction (EAQEC) code was proposed to use the pre-shared
maximally entangled state for the enhancing of error correction capability.
Recently there have been a lot of constructions of MDS EAQEC codes attaining
the quantum Singleton bound for very restricted lengths. In this paper we
construct such MDS EAQEC $[[n, k, d, c]]_q$ codes for arbitrary $n$ satisfying
$n \leq q^2+1$ and arbitrary distance $d\leq \frac{n+2}{2}$. It is proved that
for any given length $n$ satisfying $O(q^2)=n \leq q^2+1$ and any given
distance $d$ satisfying $ O(q^2)=d \leq \frac{n+2}{2}$, there exist at least
$O(q^2)$ MDS EAQEC $[[n, k, d, c]]_q$ codes with different $c$ parameters. Our
results show that there are much more MDS entanglement-assisted quantum codes
than MDS quantum codes without consumption of the maximally entangled state.
This is natural from the physical point of view. Our method can also be applied
to construct MDS entanglement-assisted quantum codes from the generalized MDS
twisted Reed-Solomon codes.

becomes unsolvable. Moreover, under hard computational budget constraints, some
non-negligible hypotheses must eventually be pruned in both planning and

the effect of budget constraints in one process over the other was barely

  Center Region","18 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context. The Galactic Center (GC) region has been studied in gamma rays in
the past decades - the GC excess detected by Fermi is still not fully
understood and the first detection of a PeVatron by H.E.S.S. indicates the
existence of sources that can accelerate cosmic rays up to a PeV or higher.
  Aims. In this paper, we are investigating the origin of the PeVatron emission
detected by H.E.S.S. by, for the first time, simulating cosmic rays in the GC
in a realistic three-dimensional gas and photon field distribution and
large-scale magnetic field.
  Methods. We solve the 3D transport equation with an anisotropic diffusion
tensor using the approach of stochastic differential equations as implemented
in the propagation software CRPropa 3.1 (Merten et al. 2017). We test five
different source distributions for four different configurations of the
diffusion tensor, i.e. with ratios of the perpendicular to parallel components
$\epsilon = 0.001,\ 0.01,\ 0.1,\ 0.3$.
  Results. We find that the two-dimensional distribution of gamma rays as
measured by H.E.S.S. is best fit by a model that considers three cosmic-ray
sources, i.e. a central source, the SNR G0.9+0.1 and the source HESS J1746-285.
The fit indicates that propagation is dominated by parallel diffusion with $
\espilon = 0.001 $.
  Conclusions. We find that the 3D propagation in the 3D gas and B-field
configurations taken from Guenduez et al. (2020) can explain the general
features of the data well. We predict that CTA should be able to identify
emission from SgrB2 and the six dust ridge clouds that are included in our
simulations and that should be detectable with a the expected resolution of CTA
of 0.033$^\circ$.

societies, so that various techniques for rumour detection have been proposed

been classified as such. This prevents an effective evaluation of the detected
rumours as well as the design of countermeasures. In this work, we argue that
explanations for detected rumours may be given in terms of examples of related
rumours detected in the past. A diverse set of similar rumours helps users to
generalize, i.e., to understand the properties that govern the detection of
rumours. Since the spread of rumours in social media is commonly modelled using
feature-annotated graphs, we propose a query-by-example approach that, given a
rumour graph, extracts the $k$ most similar and diverse subgraphs from past
rumours. The challenge is that all of the computations require fast assessment

used as context modeling layers to simplify the feature induction structures
and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, such PLM-based context
modeling can be not that aspect-specific. Therefore, a key question is left
under-explored: how the aspect-specific context can be better modeled through
PLMs? To answer the question, we attempt to enhance aspect-specific context
modeling with PLM in a non-intrusive manner. We propose three aspect-specific
input transformations, namely aspect companion, aspect prompt, and aspect
marker. Informed by these transformations, non-intrusive aspect-specific PLMs
can be achieved to promote the PLM to pay more attention to the aspect-specific
context in a sentence. Additionally, we craft an adversarial benchmark for ABSA

Extensive experimental results on standard and adversarial benchmarks for SC

yielding new state-of-the-art performance on OE and competitive performance on

just affecting an external electromagnetic field through load modulation.
Thereby, the feed current of the excited tag antenna is modulated by adapting
the passive termination load. This paper studies the achievable information
rates with a freely adaptable passive load. As a prerequisite, we unify
monostatic, bistatic, and ambient BC with circuit-based system modeling. We
present the crucial insight that channel capacity is described by existing
results on peak-power-limited quadrature Gaussian channels, because the
steady-state tag current phasor lies on a disk. Consequently, we derive the
channel capacity for the case of an unmodulated external field, for general
passive, purely reactive, or purely resistive tag loads. We find that
modulating both resistance and reactance is important for very high rates. We
discuss the capacity-achieving load statistics, the rate asymptotics, and also
the capacity of ambient BC in important special cases.
  We then propose a capacity-approaching finite constellation design: a
tailored amplitude-and-phase-shift keying on the reflection coefficient.
Furthermore, we demonstrate high rates for simple loads of just a few switched
resistors and capacitors. Finally, we investigate the rate loss from a
value-range-constrained load, which is found to be small for moderate

silicon remains one of the foremost semiconductors of the day. Of enduring
relevance to science and technology is silicon's nanomechanical behaviour
including phase transformation, amorphization and dislocations generation,
particularly in the context of molecular dynamics and materials research. So
far, comprehensive modelling of the whole cycle of events in silicon during
nanoscale deformation has not been possible, however, due to the limitations
inherent in the existing interatomic potentials. This paper examines how well
an unconventional combination of two well-known potentials - the Tersoff and
Stillinger-Weber - can perform in simulating that complexity. Our model
indicates that an irreversible deformation of silicon (Si-I) is set in motion
by a transformation to a non-diamond structure (Si-nd), and followed by a
subsequent transition to the Si-II and Si-XII' phases
(Si-I->Si-nd->Si-II->Si-XII'). This leads to the generation of dislocations
spreading outwards from the incubation zone. In effect, our simulations
parallel each and every one of the structural changes detected experimentally
in the deformed material. This includes both the sequence of phase transitions
and dislocation activity, which - taken together - neither the Tersoff nor
Stillinger-Weber, or indeed any other available Si interatomic potential, is
able to achieve in its own right. We have sought to additionally validate our
method of merging atomic potentials by applying it to germanium, and found it
can equally well predict germanium's transformation from a liquid to amorphous

analysis results show that the failed eruption of the breakout magnetic system
was mainly because of the magnetic reconnection occurred between the two sided
low-lying closed-loop systems. This reconnection enhances the confinement
capacity of the magnetic breakout system because the upward-moving reconnected
loops continuously feed new magnetic fluxes to the high-lying large-scale loop

in magnitude and a blue component narrow in magnitude and extended in colour.
We focus on the SAM galaxies to explore the origin of the CCMD components by
studying the relation between central galaxy colour and halo or galaxy

for low mass haloes and independent of them for high mass haloes. Galaxy
properties such as central supermassive black hole mass, cold gas mass, and gas
specific angular momentum can all impact central galaxy colour. These results
are corroborated by an alternative machine learning analysis in which we
attempt to predict central galaxy colour with halo and galaxy properties. We

improved using both halo and galaxy properties as input compared to using halo
properties alone. With the halo and galaxy properties considered here, we find
that subtle discrepancies remain between predicted and original colour
distribution for low mass haloes and that no significant determining properties
are identified in massive haloes, suggesting modulations by additional
stochastic processes in galaxy formation.

  Campaigns",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a widespread belief that the tone of US political language has
become more negative recently, in particular when Donald Trump entered
politics. At the same time, there is disagreement as to whether Trump changed
or merely continued previous trends. To date, data-driven evidence regarding
these questions is scarce, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining a
comprehensive, longitudinal record of politicians' utterances. Here we apply
psycholinguistic tools to a novel, comprehensive corpus of 24 million quotes
from online news attributed to 18,627 US politicians in order to analyze how
the tone of US politicians' language evolved between 2008 and 2020. We show
that, whereas the frequency of negative emotion words had decreased
continuously during Obama's tenure, it suddenly and lastingly increased with
the 2016 primary campaigns, by 1.6 pre-campaign standard deviations, or 8% of
the pre-campaign mean, in a pattern that emerges across parties. The effect
size drops by 40% when omitting Trump's quotes, and by 50% when averaging over
speakers rather than quotes, implying that prominent speakers, and Trump in
particular, have disproportionately, though not exclusively, contributed to the
rise in negative language. This work provides the first large-scale data-driven
evidence of a drastic shift toward a more negative political tone following
Trump's campaign start as a catalyst, with important implications for the
debate about the state of US politics.

semantic guidance map to refine the decoder features by aggregating multi-scale
high-level features at the intermediate resolution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing competitors

re-embeddings of border basis schemes into affine spaces of minimal dimension.
Given $P = K[X] = K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, an ideal $I\subseteq \langle X \rangle$,
and a tuple $Z$ of indeterminates, in previous papers the authors developed
techniques for computing $Z$-separating re-embeddings of $I$, i.e., of
isomorphisms $\Phi: P/I \rightarrow K[X\setminus Z] / (I\cap K[X\setminus Z])$.
Here these general techniques are developed further and improved by
constructing a new algorithm for checking candidate tuples $Z$ and by using the
Gr\""obner fan of the linear part of $I$ advantageously.
  Then we apply this to the ideals defining border basis schemes
$\mathbb{B}_{\mathcal{O}}$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is an order ideal of terms, and
to their natural generating polynomials. The fact that these ideals are
homogeneous w.r.t. the arrow grading allows us to look for suitable tuples $Z$

of the maximal ideal, we compute the Gr\""obner fan of the linear part of the

looking for optimal re-embeddings. Specific applications include re-embeddings
of border basis schemes where $\mathcal{O}\subseteq K[x,y]$ and where

string - the pattern, in another - the text, where both strings are drawn from
an alphabet set $\Sigma$. Assuming the text length is $n$ and the pattern
length is $m$, this problem can naively be solved in time $O(nm)$. In Knuth,
Morris and Pratt's seminal paper of 1977, an automaton, was developed that
allows solving this problem in time $O(n)$ for any alphabet.
  This automaton, which we will refer to as the {\em KMP-automaton}, has proven
useful in solving many other problems. A notable example is the {\em
parameterized pattern matching} model. In this model, a consistent renaming of
symbols from $\Sigma$ is allowed in a match. The parameterized matching
paradigm has proven useful in problems in software engineering, computer
vision, and other applications.
  It has long been suspected that for texts where the symbols are uniformly
random, the naive algorithm will perform as well as the KMP algorithm. In this
paper we examine the practical efficiency of the KMP algorithm vs. the naive
algorithm on a randomly generated text. We analyse the time under various
parameters, such as alphabet size, pattern length, and the distribution of
pattern occurrences in the text. We do this for both the original exact
matching problem and parameterized matching. While the folklore wisdom is
vindicated by these findings for the exact matching case, surprisingly, the KMP
algorithm works significantly faster than the naive in the parameterized
matching case.
  We check this hypothesis for DNA texts, and observe a similar behaviour as in
the random text. We also show a very structured case where the automaton is
much more efficient.

each frame consists of a number of time slots, while the low-dimensional
digital beamforming matrices and the offloading ratio are optimized more
frequently relied on the low-dimensional effective channel matrices in each

is developed to design the long-term analog beamforming matrices. As for the
short-term variables, the digital beamforming matrices are optimized relying on
the innovative penalty-concave convex procedure (penalty-CCCP) for handling the

obtained via the derived closed-form solution. Simulation results verify the

heavily dependent on large amounts of annotated training data, and usually
suffer from a severe performance degradation when encountering the
domain/distribution shift problem. Thanks to the development of unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA), some works attempt to transfer the knowledge from a
label-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain under domain shift
with UDA. However, it requires the coexistence of source and target data, which
might be impractical for source data due to the privacy or storage issues. In
this paper, we take the first step towards the source-free unsupervised domain
adaptation (SFUDA) in a simple yet efficient manner for BIQA to tackle the
domain shift without access to the source data. Specifically, we cast the
quality assessment task as a rating distribution prediction problem. Based on
the intrinsic properties of BIQA, we present a group of well-designed
self-supervised objectives to guide the adaptation of the BN affine parameters
towards the target domain. Among them, minimizing the prediction entropy and
maximizing the batch prediction diversity aim to encourage more confident
results while avoiding the trivial solution. Besides, based on the observation
that the IQA rating distribution of single image follows the Gaussian
distribution, we apply Gaussian regularization to the predicted rating
distribution to make it more consistent with the nature of human scoring.
Extensive experimental results under cross-domain scenarios demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed method to mitigate the domain shift.

can be a prime candidate biosignature in the context of future life-detection

sometimes envisaged as a biosignature, although it does not share the molecular
origin as circular polarization. It is known that the linear polarization of
surfaces is strongly dependent on the phase angle. The relation between the
phase angle and circular polarization stemming from macromolecular assemblies,
such as in vegetation, however, remained unclear. We demonstrate in this study
using the average of 27 different species that the circular polarization phase
angle dependency of vegetation induces relatively small changes in spectral

desirable performance. The key reason of this phenomenon is the coupled
formulation of NeRV, which outputs the spatial and temporal information of
video frames directly from the frame index input. In this paper, we propose
E-NeRV, which dramatically expedites NeRV by decomposing the image-wise
implicit neural representation into separate spatial and temporal context.
Under the guidance of this new formulation, our model greatly reduces the
redundant model parameters, while retaining the representation ability. We
experimentally find that our method can improve the performance to a large
extent with fewer parameters, resulting in a more than $8\times$ faster speed
on convergence. Code is available at https://github.com/kyleleey/E-NeRV.

GAN model, inverting real-world images is stuck in a dilemma that the
reconstruction cannot be faithful to the original input. The main reason for
this is that the distributions between training and real-world data are
misaligned, and because of that, it is unstable of GAN inversion for real image
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN prior based editing framework to
tackle the out-of-domain inversion problem with a composition-decomposition
paradigm. In particular, during the phase of composition, we introduce a
differential activation module for detecting semantic changes from a global
perspective, \ie, the relative gap between the features of edited and unedited
images. With the aid of the generated Diff-CAM mask, a coarse reconstruction
can intuitively be composited by the paired original and edited images. In this
way, the attribute-irrelevant regions can be survived in almost whole, while
the quality of such an intermediate result is still limited by an unavoidable
ghosting effect. Consequently, in the decomposition phase, we further present a
GAN prior based deghosting network for separating the final fine edited image
from the coarse reconstruction. Extensive experiments exhibit superiorities
over the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. The robustness and flexibility of our method is also validated on
both scenarios of single attribute and multi-attribute manipulations.

SM breaking scale $v_H$ and the Peccei Quinn (PQ) breaking scale $v_\sigma$. We
introduce heavy vector-like quarks in the usual KSVZ fashion to implement the
PQ mechanism for the strong CP problem. To generate neutrino masses via a
dimension six operator scaling as $m_\nu \sim v_H^3 / v_\sigma^2$ we add heavy
triplet and doublet leptons, which are vector-like under the SM but chiral
under PQ symmetry. The model is free from the cosmological domain wall problem
and predicts an axion to photon coupling which is about an order of magnitude
larger than in conventional DFSZ and KSVZ models. Thus our scenario can be
probed and potentially excluded by current and next generation axion
experiments such as ORGAN or MADMAX. In addition we numerically demonstrate
that our construction can generate the observed baryon asymmetry by realizing a
version of the Dirac-Leptogenesis scenario. As a consequence of our neutrino
mass mechanism we find that the asymmetry in triplet fermion decays can also be
significantly enhanced by up to six orders of magnitude when compared to
typical Seesaw scenarios without needing to invoke a resonant enhancement. In
passing we note that a decaying Dirac fermion with multiple decay modes
contains all the necessary ingredients required for the \enquote{quasi optimal

triplets. The impact of the right handed neutrinos and the axion on $\Delta

multiple images in the fashion domain. We thus propose a Multi-View Contrastive

text (e.g., product description) often contains rich fine-grained concepts
(attributes/noun phrases). To exploit this, a Pseudo-Attributes Classification

representations of the same concept to be adjacent. Further, fashion V+L tasks
uniquely include ones that do not conform to the common one-stream or

based on these outputs. We consider two variations of the model: (i) players
have costs for producing outputs; (ii) players do not have costs but have
generalized budget constraints. We observe that these games are exact potential
games and hence always have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. The price of
anarchy is $2$ for the budget model, but can be unbounded for the cost model.
Our main results are for the computational complexity of these games. We prove
that for general versions of the model exactly or approximately computing a
best response is NP-hard. For natural restricted versions where best response
is easy to compute, we show that finding a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is
PLS-complete, and finding a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is
(PPAD$\cap$PLS)-complete. On the other hand, an approximate pure-strategy Nash
equilibrium can be found in pseudo-polynomial time. These games are a strict
but natural subclass of explicit congestion games, but they still have the same
equilibrium hardness results.

  electrohydrodynamic flow with single-phase transportation schemes","50 pages,26 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present study, two schemes named face discernment and flux correction
are proposed to achieve single-phase transportation of free charge in
multiphase electrohydrodynamic(EHD) problems. Many EHD phenomena occur between
air and another liquid while the free charge can only be transported in the
liquid phase through ohmic conduction and convection due to the poor
conductivity of air. However, the charge may be leaked into the dielectric air
during the simulation due to the asynchronous transportation between interface
and free charge. To avoid this unphysical error, a face discernment method is
designed to produce an accurate ohmic conduction of free charge by providing a
superior physical properties distribution at the interface. Subsequently the
flux correction method is developed to correct the advection flux of charge
density to prevent ions crossing the interface. These two schemes are based on
the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model and independent with the specific interface
updating method. The performance of the proposed methods are carefully
validated with several test cases. The algorithms are implemented as an
OpenFOAM extension and are published as open source.

that magnetic field induces out-of-plane spin canting and thereafter gives rise

Millimeterwave (mmWave) can achieve high data transmission rates, but it is
accompanied by high propagation loss and vulnerability to blockage. To address
this issue, developments of directional antennas and unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) enhance the robustness of the mmWave train-ground communication system.
In this paper, we propose a UAV and MRs relay assistance (UMRA) algorithm to
effectively overcome link blockage, which can maximize the number of
transmission flows on the premise of meeting QoS requirements and channel
qualities. First, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
problem for UAV trajectory design and transmission scheduling in the
full-duplex (FD) mode. Then, in UMRA, the relay decision algorithm and
transmission scheduling algorithm based on graph theory are proposed, which
make a good tradeoff between computation complexity and system performance.
Extensive simulation results show that a suitable UAV position will greatly
improve the performance of the UMRA algorithm and make it close to the optimal
solution. Compared with the other two existing benchmark schemes, with the high
channel quality requirements and large-area blockage, UMRA can greatly improve
the number of completed flows and system throughput.

convenient way to test Einstein's general theory of relativity. However, before
obtaining a pure orbital decay $\dot{P}_b$ induced by gravitational wave
radiation, which is one of the PK parameters, a number of factors need to be
accounted for carefully. The effect of tidal dissipation on $\dot{P}_b$ has
been thought of as negligible. Here, we investigate the data for possible
effects of tidal dissipation on $\dot{P}_b$. The possibility of the tidal
dissipation as a contributor to $\dot{P}_b$ in a large sample of millisecond
pulsar binaries is investigated in detail. We collected a large sample of
pulsar binaries with measured $\dot{P}_b$. All of the systems are millisecond
pulsars. The residual $\dot{P}^{Res}_b$ of these systems was obtained by
subtracting the three normal effects, that is to say the effect of Shklovskii,
line-of-sight acceleration, and gravitational radiation. Assuming that tidal
dissipation is responsible for such a residual $\dot{P}^{Res}_b$, the tidal
parameters of these systems can be calculated and compared with the tidal
models. The residual $\dot{P}^{Res}_b$ is distributed over the half positive
and half negative. The dynamical tidal model can explain the residual
$\dot{P}_b$ of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries. And the Love number of
the main-sequence companion of \object{PSR J1227-4853} can be derived as a
reasonable value $k_2=0.177^{+0.098}_{-0.058}$ with the equilibrium tidal
model. Those results are compatible with the scenario of tidal dissipation.
Additionally, a weak correlation between the tidal parameter and orbital period
is revealed, likely originating in the tidal process of the recycled stage
which is worthy of further investigation.

developers from server management. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is the most
popular implementation of serverless computing, representing applications as
event-driven and stateless functions. However, existing studies report that
functions of FaaS applications severely suffer from cold-start latency. In this
paper, we propose an approach namely FaaSLight to accelerating the cold start
for FaaS applications through application-level optimization. We first conduct
a measurement study to investigate the possible root cause of the cold start
problem of FaaS. The result shows that application code loading latency is a
significant overhead. Therefore, loading only indispensable code from FaaS
applications can be an adequate solution. Based on this insight, we identify
code related to application functionalities by constructing the function-level
call graph, and separate other code (i.e., optional code) from FaaS
applications. The separated optional code can be loaded on demand to avoid the
inaccurate identification of indispensable code causing application failure. In
particular, a key principle guiding the design of FaaSLight is inherently
general, i.e., platform- and language-agnostic. The evaluation results on
real-world FaaS applications show that FaaSLight can significantly reduce the
code loading latency (up to 78.95%, 28.78% on average), thereby reducing the
cold-start latency. As a result, the total response latency of functions can be
decreased by up to 42.05% (19.21% on average). Compared with the
state-of-the-art, FaaSLight achieves a 21.25X improvement in reducing the
average total response latency.

equation (NLSE) shows that the maximum crest height of modulated wave trains
reaches triple the initial amplitude as a consequence of nonlinear long-term
evolution. Several fully nonlinear numerical studies have indicated that the
amplification can exceed 3, but its physical mechanism has not been clarified.
This study shows that spectral broadening, bound-wave production, and phase
convergence are essential to crest enhancement beyond the AB solution. The
free-wave spectrum of modulated wave trains broadens owing to nonlinear
quasi-resonant interaction. This enhances bound-wave production at high
wavenumbers. The phases of all the wave components nearly coincide at peak
modulation and enhance amplification. We find that the phase convergence
observed in linear-focusing waves can also occur due to nonlinear wave
evolution. These findings are obtained by numerically investigating the
modulated wave trains using the higher-order spectral method (HOSM) up to the
fifth order, which allows investigations of nonlinearity and spectral bandwidth
beyond the NLSE framework. Moreover, we confirm the crest enhancement through a
tank experiment wherein waves are generated in the transition region from
non-breaking to breaking. Owing to strong nonlinearity, the maximum crest
height observed in the tank begins to exceed the HOSM prediction at an initial
wave steepness of 0.10.

Such watermark-removal techniques pose a great threat to the ownership of

From the perspective of the adversary, blind watermark-removal networks can be

of vaccines are proposed. Disrupting Watermark Vaccine (DWV) induces to ruin

little is known about the actual linguistic properties used by E2E models to

study identifying the signal features and other linguistic properties used by
an E2E model to perform the SLU task. The study is carried out in the
application domain of a smart home that has to handle non-English (here French)

always require a perfect ASR capability. Furthermore, the results show the
superior capabilities of the E2E model in handling background noise and
syntactic variation compared to the pipeline model. Finally, a finer-grained
analysis suggests that the E2E model uses the pitch information of the input

including segment-level annotations, limited to recognizing previously seen
classes alone during inference. Collecting and annotating a large training set
for each class of interest is costly and hence unscalable. Zero-shot TAD
(ZS-TAD) resolves this obstacle by enabling a pre-trained model to recognize
any unseen action classes. Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with
significantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image
classification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to
tackle the more complex TAD task. An intuitive method is to integrate an
off-the-shelf proposal detector with CLIP style classification. However, due to
the sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification
design, it is prone to localization error propagation. To overcome this
problem, in this paper we propose a novel zero-Shot Temporal Action detection
model via Vision-LanguagE prompting (STALE). Such a novel design effectively
eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by breaking
the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction
mechanism between classification and localization for improved optimization.
Extensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks show that our STALE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. Besides, our model
also yields superior results on supervised TAD over recent strong competitors.

  Object Detection","Accepted by Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  (AAAI 2023)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exploiting pseudo labels (e.g., categories and bounding boxes) of unannotated
objects produced by a teacher detector have underpinned much of recent progress
in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, due to the limited
generalization capacity of the teacher detector caused by the scarce
annotations, the produced pseudo labels often deviate from ground truth,
especially those with relatively low classification confidences, thus limiting
the generalization performance of SSOD. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
dual pseudo-label polishing framework for SSOD. Instead of directly exploiting
the pseudo labels produced by the teacher detector, we take the first attempt
at reducing their deviation from ground truth using dual polishing learning,
where two differently structured polishing networks are elaborately developed
and trained using synthesized paired pseudo labels and the corresponding ground
truth for categories and bounding boxes on the given annotated objects,
respectively. By doing this, both polishing networks can infer more accurate
pseudo labels for unannotated objects through sufficiently exploiting their
context knowledge based on the initially produced pseudo labels, and thus
improve the generalization performance of SSOD. Moreover, such a scheme can be
seamlessly plugged into the existing SSOD framework for joint end-to-end
learning. In addition, we propose to disentangle the polished pseudo categories
and bounding boxes of unannotated objects for separate category classification
and bounding box regression in SSOD, which enables introducing more unannotated
objects during model training and thus further improve the performance.
Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art baselines.

For all three problems, we find that VCA outperforms SA on average in the

  Zero-Shot Chinese Character Recognition","10 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Chinese characters carry a wealth of morphological and semantic information;
therefore, the semantic enhancement of the morphology of Chinese characters has
drawn significant attention. The previous methods were intended to directly
extract information from a whole Chinese character image, which usually cannot
capture both global and local information simultaneously. In this paper, we
develop a stroke-based autoencoder(SAE), to model the sophisticated morphology
of Chinese characters with the self-supervised method. Following its canonical
writing order, we first represent a Chinese character as a series of stroke
images with a fixed writing order, and then our SAE model is trained to
reconstruct this stroke image sequence. This pre-trained SAE model can predict
the stroke image series for unseen characters, as long as their strokes or
radicals appeared in the training set. We have designed two contrasting SAE
architectures on different forms of stroke images. One is fine-tuned on
existing stroke-based method for zero-shot recognition of handwritten Chinese
characters, and the other is applied to enrich the Chinese word embeddings from
their morphological features. The experimental results validate that after
pre-training, our SAE architecture outperforms other existing methods in
zero-shot recognition and enhances the representation of Chinese characters
with their abundant morphological and semantic information.

universe indicate that local gravitationally bounded systems like galaxies and
planetary systems are unaffected by the expansion of the Universe. This result
is derived under the assumption of the space expansion described by the
standard FLRW metric. In this paper, an alternative metric is applied and the
modified Newtonian equations are derived for the space expansion described by
the conformal FLRW metric. As shown by Vavry\v{c}uk (Frontiers in Physics,
2022), this metric is advantageous, because it properly predicts the cosmic
time dilation and fits the SNe Ia luminosity observations with no need to
introduce dark energy. Surprisingly, the Newtonian equations based on the
conformal FLRW metric behave quite differently than those based on the standard
FLRW metric. In contrast to the common opinion that local systems resist the
space expansion, the results for the conformal metric indicate that all local
systems expand according to the Hubble flow. The evolution of the local systems
with cosmic time is exemplified on numerical modelling of spiral galaxies. The
size of the spiral galaxies grows consistently with observations and a typical
spiral pattern is well reproduced. The theory predicts flat rotation curves
without an assumption of dark matter surrounding the galaxy. The theory
resolves challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model such as the problem of faint
satellite galaxies, baryonic Tully-Fisher relation or the radial acceleration
relation. Furthermore, puzzles in the solar system are successfully explained

been discussed earlier. It is well-known that there are several ways of
decomposing the EH action into the bulk and the surface part with different
underlying motivations. We provide a review on all of these decompositions.
Then, we attempt to study the static coordinate as a limiting case of a
time-dependent coordinate via dynamic upgradation of the constant metric
parameters. Firstly, we study the consequences when the constant parameters,
present in a static and spherically symmetric (SSS) metric, are promoted to the
time dependent variables, which allows us to incorporate the time-dependence in
the static coordinate. We find that, in every sets of decomposition, the
expression of the bulk term remains invariant, whereas the surface term changes
by a total derivative term. Finally, when we obliterate the time dependence of
the metric parameters, we find that the expression of the Ricci-scalar (or the
EH action) does not go back to its original value. Instead, we find that the
curvature becomes singular on the horizon, which implies a topological change
from the original spacetime.

this work, we propose a novel non-blind deblurring method dubbed image and
feature space Wiener deconvolution network (INFWIDE) to tackle these problems
systematically. In terms of algorithm design, INFWIDE proposes a two-branch
architecture, which explicitly removes noise and hallucinates saturated regions

integrates the two complementary outputs with a subtle multi-scale fusion
network for high quality night photograph deblurring. For effective network
training, we design a set of loss functions integrating a forward imaging model
and backward reconstruction to form a close-loop regularization to secure good
convergence of the deep neural network. Further, to optimize INFWIDE's
applicability in real low-light conditions, a physical-process-based low-light
noise model is employed to synthesize realistic noisy night photographs for
model training. Taking advantage of the traditional Wiener deconvolution
algorithm's physically driven characteristics and arisen deep neural network's
representation ability, INFWIDE can recover fine details while suppressing the
unpleasant artifacts during deblurring. Extensive experiments on synthetic data

related to supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The ionising radiation
emitted over a quasar's lifetime alters the ionisation state of the surrounding
intergalactic medium (IGM), enhancing the Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission --
so-called proximity effect -- which can be observed in absorption spectra of
background sources. Owing to the finite speed of light, the transverse
direction of the proximity effect is sensitive to the quasar's radiative
history, resulting in `light echoes' that encode the growth history of the SMBH
on Myr-timescales. In this paper, we introduce a new technique to
photometrically map this quasar light echoes using Ly$\alpha$ forest tomography
by using a carefully selected pair of narrow-band filters. A foreground
narrow-band filter is used to measure Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission along
background galaxies selected as Ly$\alpha$ emitters by a background narrow-band
filter. This novel double narrow-band tomographic technique utilises the higher
throughput and wider field of view of imaging over spectroscopy to efficiently
reconstruct a two-dimensional map of Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission around a
quasar. We present a fully Bayesian framework to measure the luminous quasar
lifetime of a SMBH from photometric IGM tomography, and examine the
observational requirements. This new technique provides an efficient strategy
to map a large area of the sky with a modest observing time and to identify
interesting regions to be examined by further deep 3D follow-up spectroscopic

limited sets of available quantum gates and restricted connectivity. Therefore,
quantum algorithms must be transpiled in order to become executable on a given
NISQ computer; transpilation is a complex and computationally heavy process.
Moreover, NISQ computers are affected by noise that changes over time, and
periodic calibration provides relevant error rates that should be considered
during transpilation. Variational algorithms, which form one main class of
computations on NISQ platforms, produce a number of similar yet not identical
quantum ``ansatz'' circuits. In this work, we present a transpilation
methodology optimized for variational algorithms under potentially changing
error rates. We divide transpilation into three steps: (1) noise-unaware and
computationally heavy pre-transpilation; (2) fast noise-aware matching; and (3)
fast decomposition followed by heuristic optimization. For a complete run of a
variational algorithm under constant error rates, only step (3) needs to be
executed for each new ansatz circuit. Step (2) is required only if the error
rates reported by calibration have changed significantly since the beginning of
the computation. The most expensive Step (1) is executed only once for the
whole run. This distribution is helpful for incremental, calibration-aware
transpilation when the variational algorithm adapts its own execution to
changing error rates. Experimental results on IBM's quantum computer show the
low latency and robust results obtained by calibration-aware transpilation.

adversarial projections in the reverse diffusion direction. To enable training
on unpaired datasets, a cycle-consistent architecture is devised with coupled

Ginzburg-Landau free energy density embedded in curved spacetime. The lattice
ions are modeled by quantum harmonic oscillators characterized by quasi-energy
eigenvalues. This formulation is shown to predict a dynamical Casimir effect
since the zero-point energy of the ionic lattice phonons is modulated by the
gravitational wave. It is also shown that the response to a gravitational wave
is far less for the Cooper pair density than for the ionic lattice. This
predicts a ""charge separation effect"" which can be used to detect the passage

identification, which does not occur during training. Further, it can identify
all the attackers in the environment with 20 terrestrial users. A deeper
investigation into the timing requirements for recognizing attacks show that
after training, the minimum time necessary after the attack begins is 100 ms,

terrain. The fluctuations deviate from the steady, energy-minimizing pattern
for level walking, and have no obvious organization. But humans often look
ahead when they walk, and could potentially plan anticipatory fluctuations for
the terrain. Such planning is only sensible if it serves some an objective
purpose, such as maintaining constant speed or reducing energy expenditure,
that is also attainable within finite planning capacity. Here we show that
humans do plan and perform optimal control strategies on uneven terrain. Rather
than maintain constant speed, they make purposeful, anticipatory speed
adjustments that are consistent with minimizing energy expenditure. A simple
optimal control model predicts economical speed fluctuations that agree well
with experiments with humans (N = 12) walking on seven different terrain
profiles (correlated with model ro=0.55+-0.11, P<0.05 all terrains).
Participants made repeatable speed fluctuations starting about six to eight
steps ahead of each terrain feature (up to +-7.5 cm height difference each
step, up to 16 consecutive features). Nearer features matter more, because
energy is dissipated with each succeeding step collision with ground,
preventing momentum from persisting indefinitely. A finite horizon of
continuous look ahead and motor working space thus suffice to practically
optimize for any length of terrain. Humans reason about walking in the near
future to plan complex optimal control sequences.

similarly for different spatial averaging areas. However, there are few
systematic studies of averaging and forecast skill with modern forecasts, and
it is therefore not clear how much improvement in forecast performance is
produced via averaging. Here we present a direct investigation of averaging
effects, based on data from operational numerical weather forecasts. Data is
analyzed for precipitation and surface temperature, for lead times of roughly 1
to 7 days, and for time- and space-averaging diameters of 1 to 7 days and 100
to 4500 km, respectively. For different geographic locations, the effects of
time- or space-averaging can be different, and while no clear geographical
pattern is seen for precipitation, a clear spatial pattern is seen for
temperature. For temperature, in general, time averaging is most effective near
coastlines, also effective over land, and least effective over oceans. Based on
all locations globally, time averaging was less effective than one might
expect. To help understand why time averaging may sometimes be minimally
effective, a stochastic model is analyzed as a synthetic weather time series,
and analytical formulas are presented for the decorrelation time. In effect,
while time averaging creates a time series that is visually smoother, it does
not necessarily cause a substantial increase in the predictability of the time

Methods: We used 165,907 retinal images from a database of 47,236 patient

sex, presence and duration of diabetes a HDL/LDL ratios as well as any CVD
event wtihin 5 years of the retinal image acquisition. A risk score based on

mapping-based cryptosystems. Random-like behavior, a continuous broadband power
spectrum, and a weak baseline condition dependency are all characteristics of
chaotic systems. Chaos could be helpful in the three functional components of
compression, encryption, and modulation in a digital communication system. To
successfully use chaos theory in cryptography, chaotic maps must be built in
such a way that the entropy they produce can provide the necessary confusion
and diffusion. A chaotic map is used in the first layer of such cryptosystems
to create confusion, and a second chaotic map is used in the second layer to
create diffusion and create a ciphertext from a plaintext. A secret key
generation mechanism and a key exchange method are frequently left out, and
many researchers just assume that these essential components of any effective
cryptosystem are always accessible. We review such cryptosystems by using a
cryptosystem of our design, in which confusion in plaintext is created using
Arnold's Cat Map, and logistic mapping is employed to create sufficient
dispersion and ultimately get a matching ciphertext. We also address the
development of key exchange protocols and secret key schemes for these
cryptosystems, as well as the possible outcomes of using cryptanalysis
techniques on such a system.

system may make more informed decisions, and produce them for non-expert
observers to understand the reasoning behind a given action.

theories were applied to low-momentum and relativistic particles. For
low-momentum motion, Lippmann-Schwinger scattering equation was applied, called
fundamental formula; while for relativistic particles, a general scattering
theory was used which calculates S matrix. In this paper, Lippmann-Schwinger
equation is applied uniformly to both low-momentum and relativistic particles.
The cross sections are valuated to the first order of Born approximation.
One-body time-independent Green's functions for relativistic free particles are
given. Compared to the general scattering theory, the fundamental theory has a
clearer physical picture and the approximations made are more explicit.

often cause great congestion in the nodes that serve their requests. Therefore,
the problem of node overloading arises. In this article we attempt to solve the
problem of heavy traffic in a node, by proposing a mechanism that keeps the
node from overloading, regardless of the load entering in it, and which takes
into consideration both the priority and the task demand. More specifically, we
introduce a proactive, self-healing mechanism that utilizes fuzzy systems, in
combination to a non-parametric statistic method. Through our approach, we
manage to ensure the uninterrupted service of high demand or priority tasks,
regardless of the load the node may receive, based on a proactive approach.
Also, we ensure the fastest possible result delivery to the requestors, through
the high priority and high demand sensitive mechanism. A series of experimental
scenarios are used to evaluate the performance of the suggested model, while we
present the relevant numerical results.
