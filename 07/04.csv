  Transformers","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.10456",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Traditional systems typically require different models for processing
different modalities, such as one model for RGB images and another for depth
images. Recent research has demonstrated that a single model for one modality
can be adapted for another using cross-modality transfer learning. In this
paper, we extend this approach by combining cross/inter-modality transfer
learning with a vision transformer to develop a unified detector that achieves
superior performance across diverse modalities. Our research envisions an
application scenario for robotics, where the unified system seamlessly switches
between RGB cameras and depth sensors in varying lighting conditions.
Importantly, the system requires no model architecture or weight updates to
enable this smooth transition. Specifically, the system uses the depth sensor
during low-lighting conditions (night time) and both the RGB camera and depth
sensor or RGB caemra only in well-lit environments. We evaluate our unified
model on the SUN RGB-D dataset, and demonstrate that it achieves similar or
better performance in terms of mAP50 compared to state-of-the-art methods in
the SUNRGBD16 category, and comparable performance in point cloud only mode. We
also introduce a novel inter-modality mixing method that enables our model to
achieve significantly better results than previous methods. We provide our
code, including training/inference logs and model checkpoints, to facilitate
reproducibility and further research.

a crucial observation that skin disease images often exist multiple
sub-clusters within a class (i.e., the appearances of images within one class
of disease vary and form multiple distinct sub-groups), we design a novel
Sub-Cluster-Aware Network, namely SCAN, for rare skin disease diagnosis with
enhanced accuracy. As the performance of few-shot learning highly depends on
the quality of the learned feature encoder, the main principle guiding the
design of SCAN is the intrinsic sub-clustered representation learning for each
class so as to better describe feature distributions. Specifically, SCAN
follows a dual-branch framework, where the first branch is to learn class-wise
features to distinguish different skin diseases, and the second one aims to
learn features which can effectively partition each class into several groups
so as to preserve the sub-clustered structure within each class. To achieve the
objective of the second branch, we present a cluster loss to learn image
similarities via unsupervised clustering. To ensure that the samples in each
sub-cluster are from the same class, we further design a purity loss to refine
the unsupervised clustering results. We evaluate the proposed approach on two
public datasets for few-shot skin disease classification. The experimental
results validate that our framework outperforms the other state-of-the-art
methods by around 2% to 4% on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets.

As the quality of gravitational lens images increases, the task of fully
exploiting the information they contain becomes computationally and
algorithmically more difficult. In this work, we use a neural network based on
the Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) to simultaneously reconstruct an
undistorted image of the background source and the lens mass density
distribution as pixelated maps. The method we present iteratively reconstructs
the model parameters (the source and density map pixels) by learning the
process of optimization of their likelihood given the data using the physical
model (a ray-tracing simulation), regularized by a prior implicitly learned by
the neural network through its training data. When compared to more traditional
parametric models, the proposed method is significantly more expressive and can
reconstruct complex mass distributions, which we demonstrate by using realistic
lensing galaxies taken from the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation
IllustrisTNG.

known or assumed. For a step closer to real-world applications, CNNs are also
blindly trained with the whole dataset, including diverse degradations.
However, the conditional distribution of a high-quality image given a diversely
degraded one is too complicated to be learned by a single CNN. Therefore, there
have also been some methods that provide additional prior information to train
a CNN. Unlike previous approaches, we focus more on the objective of
restoration based on the Bayesian perspective and how to reformulate the
objective. Specifically, our method relaxes the original posterior inference
problem to better manageable sub-problems and thus behaves like a
divide-and-conquer scheme. As a result, the proposed framework boosts the
performance of several restoration problems compared to the previous ones.
Specifically, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on Gaussian

groups from several angles. We give a short, elementary proof that finitely

HS-stability under central extensions by showing HS-stability is preserved by
finite central quotients, but is not preserved in general. We give a
characterization of HS-stability for semidirect products $G\rtimes_\gamma

finitely generated amenable HS-stable group which is not permutation stable.
Finally, it is proved that for amenable groups flexible HS-stability is
equivalent to HS-stability, and very flexible HS stability is equivalent to
maximal almost periodicity. There is some overlap of our work with the very

their associated stronger winds from the surface -- nocturnal cooling is much
smaller over the ocean. We also analyze wind data from more than 400

distribution of the normal data. Due to the unavailability of anomalous data,
training a supervised deep neural network is a cumbersome task. As such,
unsupervised methods are preferred as a common approach to solve this task.
Deep autoencoders have been broadly adopted as a base of many unsupervised
anomaly detection methods. However, a notable shortcoming of deep autoencoders
is that they provide insufficient representations for anomaly detection by
generalizing to reconstruct outliers. In this work, we have designed an
adversarial framework consisting of two competing components, an Adversarial
Distorter, and an Autoencoder. The Adversarial Distorter is a convolutional
encoder that learns to produce effective perturbations and the autoencoder is a
deep convolutional neural network that aims to reconstruct the images from the
perturbed latent feature space. The networks are trained with opposing goals in
which the Adversarial Distorter produces perturbations that are applied to the
encoder's latent feature space to maximize the reconstruction error and the
autoencoder tries to neutralize the effect of these perturbations to minimize
it. When applied to anomaly detection, the proposed method learns semantically
richer representations due to applying perturbations to the feature space. The
proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in anomaly
detection on image and video datasets.

understanding mechanisms in mass and energy transport from the chromosphere

spectra in two altitudes, i.e., at the solar limb and 5 arcsec distance from
the solar limb, and then analyze the EE fluctuations at these two altitudes

blue and red wings indicating upward and downward flows, and some profiles have
opposite EEs in both wings. The amplitude of the Doppler velocity in the two

calculated the phase velocity of the oscillations using a technique based on

to the periodic red and blue enhancements in EEs, we suggest that the

reduction is an important and inextricable part of today's computation, we

  We provide a kernel for TSP with size polynomial in either the feedback edge
set number or the size of a modulator to constant-sized components. For its
generalizations, we also consider other structural parameters such as the
vertex cover number and the size of a modulator to constant-sized paths. We
complement our results from the negative side by showing that the existence of
a polynomial-sized kernel with respect to the fractioning number, the combined
parameter maximum degree and treewidth, and, in the case of Subset-TSP,
modulator to disjoint cycles (i.e., the treewidth two graphs) is unlikely.

  Adversarial Networks","14 pages, 17 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random noise arising from physical processes is an inherent characteristic of
measurements and a limiting factor for most signal processing and data analysis
tasks. Given the recent interest in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for
data-driven modeling, it is important to determine to what extent GANs can
faithfully reproduce noise in target data sets. In this paper, we present an
empirical investigation that aims to shed light on this issue for time series.
Namely, we assess two general-purpose GANs for time series that are based on
the popular deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture, a direct time-series
model and an image-based model that uses a short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
data representation. The GAN models are trained and quantitatively evaluated
using distributions of simulated noise time series with known ground-truth
parameters. Target time series distributions include a broad range of noise
types commonly encountered in physical measurements, electronics, and
communication systems: band-limited thermal noise, power law noise, shot noise,
and impulsive noise. We find that GANs are capable of learning many noise
types, although they predictably struggle when the GAN architecture is not well
suited to some aspects of the noise, e.g., impulsive time-series with extreme
outliers. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and potential
limitations of current approaches to time-series GANs and highlight areas for
further research. In addition, our battery of tests provides a useful benchmark
to aid the development of deep generative models for time series.

the training observations. These samples which do not conform to the
distribution of normal data are called outliers or anomalies. In real-world
anomaly detection problems, the outliers are absent, not well defined, or have
a very limited number of instances. Recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based
anomaly detection methods suffer from high computational cost, complexity,
unstable training procedures, and non-trivial implementation, making them
difficult to deploy in real-world applications. To combat this problem, we
leverage a simple learning procedure that trains a lightweight convolutional
neural network, reaching state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection. In
this paper, we propose to solve anomaly detection as a supervised regression
problem. We label normal and anomalous data using two separable distributions
of continuous values. To compensate for the unavailability of anomalous samples
during training time, we utilize straightforward image augmentation techniques
to create a distinct set of samples as anomalies. The distribution of the
augmented set is similar but slightly deviated from the normal data, whereas
real anomalies are expected to have an even further distribution. Therefore,
training a regressor on these augmented samples will result in more separable
distributions of labels for normal and real anomalous data points. Anomaly
detection experiments on image and video datasets show the superiority of the
proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

error bounds only requires evaluating the differential equation residual

network residuals, which is known and used as loss function, and the absolute

semi-phenomonological and independent of knowledge of the actual solution or

renormalon-free (RF) scheme for the gluon condensate (GC) matrix element. In
addition, the perturbative convergence of spectral function moments with a
sizeable GC correction can be improved. The RF GC scheme depends on an IR
factorization scale $R$ and the normalization $N_g$ of the GC renormalon. In
the present work, we use three different methods to determine $N_g$, yielding a
result with an uncertainty of $40\%$. Following two recent state-of-the-art
strong coupling determination analyses at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$, we show that
using the renormalon-free GC scheme successfully reconciles the results for
$\alpha_s({m_\tau^2})$ based on CIPT and FOPT. The uncertainties due to
variations of $R$ and the uncertainty of $N_g$ only lead to a small or moderate
increase of the final uncertainty of $\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)$, and affect mainly
the CIPT expansion method. The FOPT and CIPT results obtained in the RF GC

powerful new ingredient for future analyses of $\tau$ hadronic spectral

address these challenges, this paper proposes a new multitask learning

complementing the strength of existing shallow and deep multitask learning
scenarios. Specifically, we propose to model the task relation as the
similarity between task input gradients, with a theoretical analysis of their
equivalency. In addition, we innovatively propose a multitask learning
objective that explicitly learns task relations by a new regularizer.
Theoretical analysis shows that the generalizability error has been reduced

(AGN) discs offer a promising dynamical channel to produce black-hole mergers

Using a suite of 2D high-resolution simulations of prograde equal-mass circular
binaries in local disc models, we systematically study how their hydrodynamical
evolution depends on the equation of state (EOS; including the $\gamma$-law and
isothermal EOS) and on the binary mass and separation scales (relative to the
supermassive BH mass and the Hill radius, respectively). We find that binaries
accrete slower and contract in orbit if the EOS is far from isothermal such
that the surrounding gas is diffuse, hot, and turbulent. The typical orbital
decay rate is of the order of a few times the mass doubling rate. For a fixed
EOS, the accretion flows are denser, hotter, and more turbulent around more
massive or tighter binaries. The torque associated with accretion is often
comparable to the gravitational torque, so both torques are essential in
determining the long-term binary orbital evolution. We carry out additional
simulations with non-accreting binaries and find that their orbital evolution
can be stochastic and is sensitive to the gravitational softening length, and
the secular orbital evolution can be very different from those of accreting
binaries. Our results indicate that stellar-mass BBHs may be hardened
efficiently under ideal conditions, namely less massive and wider binaries
embedded in discs with a non-isothermal EOS.

thorough understanding of how robot's ""gender"" has been understood within the
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community - i.e., how it has been manipulated, in
which contexts, and which effects it has yield on people's perceptions and
interactions with robots - we performed a scoping review of the literature. We
identified 553 papers relevant for our review retrieved from 5 different
databases. The final sample of reviewed papers included 35 papers written
between 2005 and 2021, which involved a total of 3902 participants. In this
article, we thoroughly summarize these papers by reporting information about
their objectives and assumptions on gender (i.e., definitions and reasons to
manipulate gender), their manipulation of robot's ""gender"" (i.e., gender cues
and manipulation checks), their experimental designs (e.g., demographics of
participants, employed robots), and their results (i.e., main and interaction
effects). The review reveals that robot's ""gender"" does not affect crucial
constructs for the HRI, such as likability and acceptance, but rather bears its
strongest effect on stereotyping. We leverage our different epistemological
backgrounds in Social Robotics and Gender Studies to provide a comprehensive
interdisciplinary perspective on the results of the review and suggest ways to
move forward in the field of HRI.

bounds for a general two-user IM/DD IC under peak and average optical intensity

the IM/DD IC is shown to have a `W' shape similar to the Gaussian IC with power

interference regimes to show their tightness, and used to study the performance
of on-chip and indoor OWC systems.

field. The DQD system exhibits a complex multi-level energy spectrum. By
varying the photon energy, several anti-crossings between photon dressed
electron states of the DQD-cavity system are found at low strength of the
magnetic field. The anti-crossings are identified as multiple Rabi resonances
arising from the photon exchange between these states. As the results, a dip in
the current is seen caused by the multiple Rabi resonances. By increasing the
strength of the external magnetic field, a dislocation of the current dip to a
lower photon energy is found and the current dip can be diminished. The
interplay of the strength of the magnetic field and the geometry of the states

crucial to building a system that performs robustly in the real world. Both
markdown systems achieve superior profitability compared to decisions made by
our experienced operations teams in a controlled online test, with improvements
of 86% (Promotheus) and 79% (Ithax) relative to manual strategies. These
systems have been deployed to manage markdown at ASOS.com, and both systems can

  Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Tikhonov regularization is a common technique used when solving poorly
behaved optimization problems. Often, and with good reason, this technique is
applied by practitioners in an ad hoc fashion. In this note, we systematically
illustrate the role of Tikhonov regularizations in two simple, yet instructive
examples. In one example, we use regular perturbation theory to predict the
impact Tikhonov regularizations have on condition numbers of symmetric,
positive semi-definite matrices. We then use a numerical example to confirm our
result. In another example, we construct an exactly solvable optimal control
problem that exhibits a boundary layer phenomenon. Since optimal control
problems are rarely exactly solvable, this brings clarity to how vital Tikhonov
regularizations are for the class of problems this example represents. We solve
the problem numerically using MATLAB's built-in optimization software and
compare results with a Galerkin-type/genetic algorithm. We find the second
method generally outperforms MATLAB's optimization routines and we provide the
MATLAB code used to generate the numerics. Finally, to demonstrate the utility
of Tikhonov regularization from the second example in a more technologically
realistic application, we show that regularization guides the design of
gradient-index optical devices toward those which are significantly less
expensive to fabricate.

extend the relativistic quantum channel associated to these non-perturbative

interaction with the vacuum state but with Gaussian operators applied to the
field operators via the adjoint channel, effectively giving a ""Fourier

propagators in spacetime. Furthermore, we show that in these non-perturbative

hence, via the replica trick, the von Neumann entropy for the field state after
the interaction with the detector, without making any assumptions about the
purity of the joint initial states of the detector and the field. This gives us

computationally efficient, and achieve optimal error resilience.
  While interactive coding over large alphabets is well understood, the
situation over the binary alphabet has remained evasive. At the present moment,
the known schemes over the binary alphabet that achieve a higher error
resilience than a trivial adaptation of large alphabet schemes are either still
suboptimally error resilient [EKS20], or optimally error resilient with

of representation as well as the specific processing algorithm or operator.
e.g. simulation using the Finite Element Method, calculating Betti numbers,
etc. We propose a novel method that can coarsen triangle meshes, tetrahedral
meshes and simplicial complexes. Our method allows controllable preservation of
salient features from the high-resolution geometry and can therefore be
customized to different applications.
  Salient properties are typically captured by local shape descriptors via
linear differential operators -- variants of Laplacians. Eigenvectors of their
discretized matrices yield a useful spectral domain for geometry processing
(akin to the famous Fourier spectrum which uses eigenfunctions of the
derivative operator). Existing methods for spectrum-preserving coarsening use
zero-dimensional discretizations of Laplacian operators (defined on vertices).
We propose a generalized spectral coarsening method that considers multiple
Laplacian operators defined in different dimensionalities in tandem. Our simple
algorithm greedily decides the order of contractions of simplices based on a
quality function per simplex. The quality function quantifies the error due to
removal of that simplex on a chosen band within the spectrum of the coarsened

analytically continued onto the complex wave numbers. In the ground state they
become complex zeros of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. The analysis of those
roots yields the phase diagram which contains continuous quantum phase
transitions and weaker singularities known as disorder lines (DLs) or
modulation transitions. The latter, reported for the first time in this model,
are shown to occur in two types: DLs of the first kind with continuous
appearance of the IC oscillations, and DLs of the second kind corresponding to
a jump of the wave number of oscillations. The salient property of zeros of the
spectrum is that the ground state is shown to be separable (factorized) and the
model is disentangled on a subset of the DLs. From analysis of those zeros we
also find the Majorana edge states and their wave functions.

leveraging on the knowledge that the optimal predictive controller is expressed
as a piecewise affine (PWA) law, we directly optimize the parameters of such an
analytical controller from data, instead of running an on-line optimization
problem. As the proposed method allows us to automatically retrieve also a
model of the closed-loop system, we show that we can apply model-based
techniques to perform a stability check prior to the controller deployment. The
effectiveness of the proposed strategy is assessed on two benchmark simulation
examples, through which we also discuss the use of regularization and its
combination with averaging techniques to handle the presence of noise.

Typically, linear models can be used to describe the temporal autocorrelation
of the (logarithmic) variance of returns. Considering the difficulty in
estimating this model, we construct a Dynamic Bayesian Network, which utilizes
the conjugate prior relation of normal-gamma and gamma-gamma, so that its
posterior form locally remains unchanged at each node. This makes it possible
to find approximate solutions using variational methods quickly. Furthermore,
we ensure that the volatility expressed by the model is an independent
incremental process after inserting dummy gamma nodes between adjacent time
steps. We have found that this model has two advantages: 1) It can be proved
that it can express heavier tails than Gaussians, i.e., have positive excess
kurtosis, compared to popular linear models. 2) If the variational
inference(VI) is used for state estimation, it runs much faster than Monte
Carlo(MC) methods since the calculation of the posterior uses only basic
arithmetic operations. And its convergence process is deterministic.
  We tested the model, named Gam-Chain, using recent Crypto, Nasdaq, and Forex
records of varying resolutions. The results show that: 1) In the same case of
using MC, this model can achieve comparable state estimation results with the
regular lognormal chain. 2) In the case of only using VI, this model can obtain
accuracy that are slightly worse than MC, but still acceptable in practice; 3)
Only using VI, the running time of Gam-Chain, in general case, can be reduced

degradation on clean samples. A major bottleneck identified by previous works
is the widely used batch normalization (BN), which struggles to model the
different statistics of clean and adversarial training samples in AT. Although
the dominant approach is to extend BN to capture this mixture of distribution,
we propose to completely eliminate this bottleneck by removing all BN layers in
AT. Our normalizer-free robust training (NoFrost) method extends recent
advances in normalizer-free networks to AT for its unexplored advantage on
handling the mixture distribution challenge. We show that NoFrost achieves
adversarial robustness with only a minor sacrifice on clean sample accuracy. On
ImageNet with ResNet50, NoFrost achieves $74.06\%$ clean accuracy, which drops
merely $2.00\%$ from standard training. In contrast, BN-based AT obtains
$59.28\%$ clean accuracy, suffering a significant $16.78\%$ drop from standard
training. In addition, NoFrost achieves a $23.56\%$ adversarial robustness
against PGD attack, which improves the $13.57\%$ robustness in BN-based AT. We
observe better model smoothness and larger decision margins from NoFrost, which
make the models less sensitive to input perturbations and thus more robust.
Moreover, when incorporating more data augmentations into NoFrost, it achieves
comprehensive robustness against multiple distribution shifts. Code and

Huge number of map points bring us a high computational complexity, making it
difficult to be deployed on mobile devices. On the other hand, planes are
common structures in man-made environment especially in indoor environments. We
usually can use a small number of planes to represent a large scene. So the
main purpose of this article is to decrease the high complexity of sparse
points based SLAM. We build a lightweight back-end map which consists of a few
planes and map points to achieve efficient bundle adjustment (BA) with an equal
or better accuracy. We use homography constraints to eliminate the parameters
of numerous plane points in the optimization and reduce the complexity of BA.
We separate the parameters and measurements in homography and point-to-plane
constraints and compress the measurements part to further effectively improve
the speed of BA. We also integrate the plane information into the whole system
to realize robust planar feature extraction, data association, and global
consistent planar reconstruction. Finally, we perform an ablation study and
compare our method with similar methods in simulation and real environment
data. Our system achieves obvious advantages in accuracy and efficiency. Even
if the plane parameters are involved in the optimization, we effectively
simplify the back-end map by using planar structures. The global bundle
adjustment is nearly 2 times faster than the sparse points based SLAM

methods commonly suffer from significant performance degradation when the
training set is long-tail distributed. Through analysis, we posit that this is
because the models struggle to distinguish the minority tail-class

more prone to be falsely detected as OOD. To solve this problem, we propose
Partial and Asymmetric Supervised Contrastive Learning (PASCL), which

Computer vision models have been developed to predict the fixations made by

target? Equally important is to know how people search when they cannot find a
target, and when they would stop searching. In this paper, we propose the first
data-driven computational model that addresses the search-termination problem

targets that do not appear in images. We model visual search as an imitation
learning problem and represent the internal knowledge that the viewer acquires
through fixations using a novel state representation that we call Foveated
Feature Maps (FFMs). FFMs integrate a simulated foveated retina into a
pretrained ConvNet that produces an in-network feature pyramid, all with
minimal computational overhead. Our method integrates FFMs as the state
representation in inverse reinforcement learning. Experimentally, we improve
the state of the art in predicting human target-absent search behavior on the

ability to execute management strategies of various maneuvers and the new
maneuver could be extended without revising the existing part. The
fault-tolerant mechanism is designed as a maneuver triggered by hardware
failures to keep safe before taking over. Furthermore, three typical maneuvers
are selected for case studies to illustrate how the management strategies in
this framework work. Finally, a comprehensive simulation scenario integrating
different maneuvers is designed and a real-world implementation using
micro-vehicles is conducted. Results show that the propose two-dimensional

a novel fairness learning method termed CUrvature MAtching (CUMA), which can
achieve robust fairness generalizable to unseen domains with unknown
distributional shifts. Specifically, CUMA enforces the model to have similar
generalization ability on the majority and minority groups, by matching the
loss curvature distributions of the two groups. We evaluate our method on three
popular fairness datasets. Compared with existing methods, CUMA achieves
superior fairness under unseen distribution shifts, without sacrificing either

obtain analogous results in case of the angular non-cutoff or even in the
grazing limit which gives the Landau equation, essentially due to the velocity
diffusion effect of collision operator such that $L^\infty$ estimates are hard
to obtain without using Sobolev embeddings. In the paper, we are concerned with
the compressible Euler and acoustic limits of the Landau equation for Coulomb
potentials in the whole space. Specifically, over any finite time interval
where the full compressible Euler system admits a smooth solution around
constant states, we construct a unique solution in a high-order weighted
Sobolev space for the Landau equation with suitable initial data and also show
the uniform estimates independent of the small Knudsen number $\varepsilon>0$,
yielding the $O(\varepsilon)$ convergence of the Landau solution to the local
Maxwellian whose fluid quantities are the given Euler solution. Moreover, the
acoustic limit for smooth solutions to the Landau equation in an optimal
scaling is also established. For the proof, by using the macro-micro
decomposition around local Maxwellians together with techniques for viscous
compressible fluid and properties of Burnett functions, we design an
$\varepsilon$-dependent energy functional to capture the dissipation in the
compressible fluid limit with feature that only the highest order derivatives
are most singular.

delicate down-sampling strategies, including interval sampling and continuous

preserves the majority of its information. We conduct extensive experiments on
eight widely used benchmark datasets. Compared with the existing

  Statement Data",,,,,"q-fin.CP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, the application of advanced machine learning methods for asset
management has become one of the most intriguing topics. Unfortunately, the
application of these methods, such as deep neural networks, is difficult due to
the data shortage problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach
using neural networks to construct a portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETFs)
based on the financial statement data of their components. Although a number of
ETFs and ETF-managed portfolios have emerged in the past few decades, the
ability to apply neural networks to manage ETF portfolios is limited since the
number and historical existence of ETFs are relatively smaller and shorter,
respectively, than those of individual stocks. Therefore, we use the data of
individual stocks to train our neural networks to predict the future
performance of individual stocks and use these predictions and the portfolio
deposit file (PDF) to construct a portfolio of ETFs. Multiple experiments have
been performed, and we have found that our proposed method outperforms the
baselines. We believe that our approach can be more beneficial when managing
recently listed ETFs, such as thematic ETFs, of which there is relatively
limited historical data for training advanced machine learning methods.

  Scenarios",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pool-based Active Learning (AL) has achieved great success in minimizing
labeling cost by sequentially selecting informative unlabeled samples from a
large unlabeled data pool and querying their labels from oracle/annotators.
However, existing AL sampling strategies might not work well in
out-of-distribution (OOD) data scenarios, where the unlabeled data pool
contains some data samples that do not belong to the classes of the target
task. Achieving good AL performance under OOD data scenarios is a challenging
task due to the natural conflict between AL sampling strategies and OOD sample
detection. AL selects data that are hard to be classified by the current basic
classifier (e.g., samples whose predicted class probabilities have high
entropy), while OOD samples tend to have more uniform predicted class
probabilities (i.e., high entropy) than in-distribution (ID) data. In this
paper, we propose a sampling scheme, Monte-Carlo Pareto Optimization for Active
Learning (POAL), which selects optimal subsets of unlabeled samples with fixed
batch size from the unlabeled data pool. We cast the AL sampling task as a
multi-objective optimization problem, and thus we utilize Pareto optimization
based on two conflicting objectives: (1) the normal AL data sampling scheme
(e.g., maximum entropy), and (2) the confidence of not being an OOD sample.
Experimental results show its effectiveness on both classical Machine Learning

a factor of two or reduced by one order of magnitude, and linewidth was
slightly narrowed by the pumping effect. Similar behavior is also seen by
increasing the optical density (OD) of the medium. The EIT feature is predicted
quantitatively using a Doppler-free non-perturbation numerical calculation.
With and without the optical pumping field, the EIT peak heights collapse onto
the same theoretical curve, showing that OP and varying OD have the same
effect. In both simulations and measurements, Rydberg EIT enhancement through
OP is dependent on the intensity of the probe field and the OD. Our work
clarifies the underlying mechanisms of optical pumping and advances

which shows a certain superiority in separating target speaker's voice

implementation, contrastive learning or adversarial training approach is
applied to maximize these two correlations. Both of them work well, while
adversarial training shows its advantage by avoiding some limitations of

speech for a target speaker by transferring the emotion from reference speech
recorded by another (source) speaker. In this task, extracting
speaker-independent emotion embedding from reference speech plays an important
role. However, the emotional information conveyed by such emotion embedding
tends to be weakened in the process to squeeze out the source speaker's timbre
information. In response to this problem, a prosody compensation module (PCM)
is proposed in this paper to compensate for the emotional information loss.
Specifically, the PCM tries to obtain speaker-independent emotional information
from the intermediate feature of a pre-trained ASR model. To this end, a
prosody compensation encoder with global context (GC) blocks is introduced to
obtain global emotional information from the ASR model's intermediate feature.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PCM can effectively compensate the
emotion embedding for the emotional information loss, and meanwhile maintain
the timbre of the target speaker. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models show
that our proposed method presents obvious superiority on the cross-speaker
emotion transfer task.

Then to learn from this sparse data, we propose a representation-learning-based

better understanding of their numerical properties. Some works have modelled
the effectiveness of retrieval metrics with axioms that capture desirable
properties on the set of rankings of documents. This paper formally explores
the effect of these ranking axioms on the numerical values of some IR
evaluation metrics. It focuses on the set of ranked lists of documents with
multigrade relevance. The possible orderings in this set are derived from three
commonly accepted ranking axioms on retrieval metrics; then, they are
classified by their latticial properties. When relevant documents are
prioritised, a subset of document rankings are identified: the join-irreducible
elements, which have some resemblance to the concept of basis in vector space.
It is possible to compute the precision, recall, RBP or DCG values of any
ranking from their values in the join-irreducible elements. However this is not
the case when the swapping of documents is considered.

magnetic heterostructures. Here, in asymmetric Pt/Co/Pt heterostructures,
anti-damping (AD) SOT prevails. Ta addition to this stack (Ta/Pt/Co/Pt) give
rise to several compelling effects viz. competing spin currents (due to
opposite spin-Hall angles of adjacent Ta and Pt layers), significant AD-SOT,
thermoelectric effects (particularly, anomalous Nernst effect (ANE)), and
enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. For this Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack, the
AD-SOT values are stabilized to that of the Pt/Co/Pt stack, which is
significant than what is expected for a stack with competing spin currents.
Current-induced field-free magnetization switching was absent in uniformly
grown Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack. It was observed that a thickness gradient is essential
to assist the field-free magnetization switching in these heterostructures.
Further, the thermoelectric effects are utilized to develop a technique to
detect the field-free magnetization switching. This technique detects the
second harmonic ANE signal as a reading mechanism. Using ANE symmetry with the
applied current, the switching can be detected in a single current sweep which
was corroborated to the conventional DC Hall method.

object-level semantic consensus. This is often violated in real-world
applications where an expression can be queried to false videos, and existing
methods always fail in such false queries due to abusing the assumption. In
this work, we emphasize that studying semantic consensus is necessary to
improve the robustness of R-VOS. Accordingly, we pose an extended task from
R-VOS without the semantic consensus assumption, named Robust R-VOS
($\mathrm{R}^2$-VOS). The $\mathrm{R}^2$-VOS task is essentially related to the
joint modeling of the primary R-VOS task and its dual problem (text
reconstruction). We embrace the observation that the embedding spaces have
relational consistency through the cycle of text-video-text transformation,
which connects the primary and dual problems. We leverage the cycle consistency
to discriminate the semantic consensus, thus advancing the primary task.
Parallel optimization of the primary and dual problems are enabled by
introducing an early grounding medium. A new evaluation dataset,
$\mathrm{R}^2$-Youtube-VOS, is collected to measure the robustness of R-VOS
models against unpaired videos and expressions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method not only identifies negative pairs of unrelated
expressions and videos, but also improves the segmentation accuracy for
positive pairs with a superior disambiguating ability. Our model achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on Ref-DAVIS17, Ref-Youtube-VOS, and the novel
$\mathrm{R}^2$-Youtube-VOS dataset.

signal extrapolation. It can widely be used in many applications in image and
video communication, e. g. for concealment of block errors caused by
transmission errors or for prediction in video coding. The signal extrapolation
is performed by extending a signal from a limited number of known samples into
areas beyond these samples. Therefore a finite set of orthogonal basis
functions is used and the known part of the signal is projected onto them.
Since the basis functions are not orthogonal regarding the area of the known
samples, the projection does not lead to the real portion a basis function has
of the signal. The proposed algorithm efficiently copes with this
non-orthogonality resulting in very good objective and visual extrapolation
results for edges, smooth areas, as well as structured areas. Compared to an
existent implementation, this algorithm has a significantly lower computational
complexity without any degradation in quality. The processing time can be
reduced by a factor larger than 100.

segmentation, one of the fundamental tasks of computer vision. However, the
current segmentation algorithms mostly rely on the availability of pixel-level
annotations, which are often expensive, tedious, and laborious. To alleviate
this burden, the past years have witnessed an increasing attention in building
label-efficient, deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms. This paper
offers a comprehensive review on label-efficient image segmentation methods. To
this end, we first develop a taxonomy to organize these methods according to
the supervision provided by different types of weak labels (including no
supervision, inexact supervision, incomplete supervision and inaccurate
supervision) and supplemented by the types of segmentation problems (including
semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation). Next,
we summarize the existing label-efficient image segmentation methods from a
unified perspective that discusses an important question: how to bridge the gap
between weak supervision and dense prediction -- the current methods are mostly
based on heuristic priors, such as cross-pixel similarity, cross-label
constraint, cross-view consistency, and cross-image relation. Finally, we share
our opinions about the future research directions for label-efficient deep
image segmentation.

  Hypothesis","14 pages in total, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On a microscopic scale, resistivity during electric conduction is caused by
collisions of the free conduction electrons with the obstructing atoms or
molecules of the conductor material, resulting in heat production. Based on
this fundamental understanding, a hypothesis concerning a physical requirement
of the superconductor material is proposed, which suggests that for
superconductivity (i.e., with zero resistivity) to occur, the conductor
material must have nano-sized, continuous and straight vacuum tunnels inside
with effective radius size large enough to allow collision-free conduction of
free electrons. Besides, some of the composite atoms of the conductor should be
able to readily release electrons to form the conduction band; in fact, this
basic requirement is for all forms of electrical conductors, not just for
superconductors. The proposed hypothesis is supported by experimental
observations in the literature, and also offers a plausible explanation for
some of the poorly-understood experimental phenomena observed in the past. In
addition, the hypothesis offers practical strategies for the rational design of
electrical conductors with (quasi-)superconductivity. Lastly, the proposed new
hypothesis also suggests a novel mechanism for neural microtubule-mediated
electrical quasi-superconductance in the nervous system.

classification needs the global representation of scene segments, which

special interest and has been subject of recent work. In this work, we review
the existing definitions for uncertainty calibration of probabilistic
regression tasks. We inspect the calibration properties of common detection
networks and extend state-of-the-art recalibration methods. Our methods use a
Gaussian process (GP) recalibration scheme that yields parametric distributions
as output (e.g. Gaussian or Cauchy). The usage of GP recalibration allows for a
local (conditional) uncertainty calibration by capturing dependencies between
neighboring samples. The use of parametric distributions such as as Gaussian
allows for a simplified adaption of calibration in subsequent processes, e.g.,
for Kalman filtering in the scope of object tracking.
  In addition, we use the GP recalibration scheme to perform covariance
estimation which allows for post-hoc introduction of local correlations between
the output quantities, e.g., position, width, or height in object detection. To
measure the joint calibration of multivariate and possibly correlated data, we
introduce the quantile calibration error which is based on the Mahalanobis
distance between the predicted distribution and the ground truth to determine
whether the ground truth is within a predicted quantile.
  Our experiments show that common detection models overestimate the spatial
uncertainty in comparison to the observed error. We show that the simple
Isotonic Regression recalibration method is sufficient to achieve a good
uncertainty quantification in terms of calibrated quantiles. In contrast, if
normal distributions are required for subsequent processes, our GP-Normal
recalibration method yields the best results. Finally, we show that our
covariance estimation method is able to achieve best calibration results for
joint multivariate calibration.

of the momentum-resolved spectral function rises on moving away from the point

behavior remarkably similar to what is observed in the pseudogap phase. We
unveil these features by using a parallelized cluster-based Monte-Carlo method

enhance the wireless communication network coverage and capacity by dynamically
controlling the radio signal propagation environment. In contrast to the
existing works that considered active or passive IRS only, we propose in this
paper a new hybrid active-passive IRS architecture that consists of both active
and passive reflecting elements, thus achieving their combined advantages
flexibly. Under a practical channel setup with Rician fading where only the
statistical channel state information (CSI) is available, we study the hybrid
IRS design in a multi-user communication system. Specifically, we formulate an
optimization problem to maximize the achievable ergodic capacity of the
worst-case user by designing the hybrid IRS beamforming and active/passive
elements allocation based on the statistical CSI, subject to various practical
constraints on the active-element amplification factor and amplification power
consumption, as well as the total active and passive elements deployment
budget. To solve this challenging problem, we first approximate the ergodic
capacity in a simpler form and then propose an efficient algorithm to solve the
problem optimally. Moreover, we show that for the special case with all
channels to be line-of-sight (LoS), only active elements need to be deployed
when the total deployment budget is sufficiently small, while both active and
passive elements should be deployed with a decreasing number ratio when the
budget increases and exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, numerical results
are presented which demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed hybrid
IRS architecture and its optimal design over the conventional schemes with
active/passive IRS only under various practical system setups.

finite set of samples drawn from another unknown distribution. We show that a
particular instance of invertible neural networks, namely the normalizing

push-forward operator to be retrieved is then restricted to be a normalizing
flow which is trained by optimizing the resulting cost function. This approach
allows the transport map to be discretized as a composition of functions. Each
of these functions is associated to one sub-flow of the network, whose output
provides intermediate steps of the transport between the original and target
measures. This discretization yields also a set of intermediate barycenters
between the two measures of interest. Experiments conducted on toy examples as
well as a challenging task of unsupervised translation demonstrate the interest
of the proposed method. Finally, some experiments show that the proposed

this issue; however, electrically pumped emission from the resulting polaritons

problem. This paper proposes a model-free controller using novel 3D global
deformation features based on modal analysis. Unlike most existing controllers
using geometric features, our controller employs a physically-based deformation
feature by decoupling 3D global deformation into low-frequency mode shapes.
Although modal analysis is widely adopted in computer vision and simulation, it
has not been used in robotic deformation control. We develop a new model-free
framework for modal-based deformation control under robot manipulation.
Physical interpretation of mode shapes enables us to formulate an analytical
deformation Jacobian matrix mapping the robot manipulation onto changes of the
modal features. In the Jacobian matrix, unknown geometry and physical
properties of the object are treated as low-dimensional modal parameters which
can be used to linearly parameterize the closed-loop system. Thus, an adaptive
controller with proven stability can be designed to deform the object while
online estimating the modal parameters. Simulations and experiments are
conducted using linear, planar, and solid objects under different settings. The
results not only confirm the superior performance of our controller but also
demonstrate its advantages over the baseline method.

ensure the higher use value of the stored experiences. In addition, combined
with curriculum learning (CL), a more reasonable training paradigm of sampling
experiences from simple to difficult is designed for training UAVs. By training
in a complex unknown environment constructed based on the parameters of a real
UAV, the proposed ACER improves the convergence speed by 24.66\% and the
convergence result by 5.59\% compared to the state-of-the-art twin delayed deep

packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithms have been developed to mitigate voice
transmission failures by reconstructing the lost information. Limited by the

Specifically, a combination of the nested-UNet and temporal feature-wise linear

intra-frame information and establish inter-frame temporal dependencies. To
complement the missing speech content caused by longer loss bursts, we employ
multi-stage gated vector quantizers to capture the correct content and
reconstruct the near-real smooth audio. Extensive experiments on the PLC

effectively reduce command confusion errors. Specifically, we design and

computing architectures: a long-distance two-qubit gate. Previous proposals for
long-distance coupling with magnons involved off-resonant coupling, where the
detuning of the spin-qubit frequency from the magnonic band edge provides
protection against spontaneous relaxation. The topological magnon mode, on the
other hand, lies in-between two magnonic bands far away from any bulk magnon
resonances, facilitating strong and highly tuneable coupling between the two
spin qubits. Even though the coupling between the qubit and the chiral magnon
is resonant for a wide range of qubit splittings, we find that the
magnon-induced qubit relaxation is vastly suppressed if the coupling between
the qubit and the ferromagnet is antiferromagnetic. A fast and high-fidelity
long-distance coupling protocol is presented capable of achieving spin-qubit
entanglement over micrometer distances with $1\,$MHz gate speed and up to
$99.9\%$ fidelities. The resulting spin-qubit entanglement may be used as a
probe for the long-sought detection of topological edge magnons.

devices to achieve hands-free user experience. However, in real applications,
false alarm (FA) would be a serious problem for spotting dozens or even
hundreds of keywords, which drastically affects user experience. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we leverage the recent advances in transducer and
transformer based acoustic models and propose a new multi-stage customized KWS
framework named Cascaded Transducer-Transformer KWS (CaTT-KWS), which includes
a transducer based keyword detector, a frame-level phone predictor based force
alignment module and a transformer based decoder. Specifically, the streaming
transducer module is used to spot keyword candidates in audio stream. Then
force alignment is implemented using the phone posteriors predicted by the
phone predictor to finish the first stage keyword verification and refine the
time boundaries of keyword. Finally, the transformer decoder further verifies
the triggered keyword. Our proposed CaTT-KWS framework reduces FA rate
effectively without obviously hurting keyword recognition accuracy.
Specifically, we can get impressively 0.13 FA per hour on a challenging
dataset, with over 90% relative reduction on FA comparing to the transducer
based detection model, while keyword recognition accuracy only drops less than
2%.

a Lifshiftz transition, which is clearly distinct from the cases of the linked

engineering, both theoretically and practically. Although it is suitable to
numerically solve partial differential equations to calculate the prices of
certain types of derivatives, the computational complexity increases
exponentially as the number of underlying assets increases in some classical
methods, such as the finite difference method. Therefore, there are efforts to
reduce the computational complexity by using quantum computation. However, when
solving with naive quantum algorithms, the target derivative price is embedded
in the amplitude of one basis of the quantum state, and so an exponential
complexity is required to obtain the solution. To avoid the bottleneck, the
previous study~[Miyamoto and Kubo, IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,
\textbf{3}, 1--25 (2022)] utilizes the fact that the present price of a
derivative can be obtained by its discounted expected value at any future point
in time and shows that the quantum algorithm can reduce the complexity. In this
paper, to make the algorithm feasible to run on a small quantum computer, we
use variational quantum simulation to solve the Black-Scholes equation and
compute the derivative price from the inner product between the solution and a
probability distribution. This avoids the measurement bottleneck of the naive
approach and would provide quantum speedup even in noisy quantum computers. We
also conduct numerical experiments to validate our method. Our method will be
an important breakthrough in derivative pricing using small-scale quantum
computers.

the literature that were based on a separate estimation of the marginal

time-inhomogeneous version of a multivariate PH class (mIPH) that leads to a
model for joint lifetimes without that separation. We study properties of mIPH
class members and provide an adapted estimation procedure that allows for
right-censoring and covariate information. We show that initial distribution

paper describes a study of soft, low-frictional hydro\-gel spheres in a

their discharge by placing an obstacle in front of the outlet of the silo.
High-speed optical imaging is used to capture the process of discharge. All
particles in the field of view are identified and tracked by means of machine
learning software using a MASK R-CNN algorithm. With particle tracking
velocimetry (PTV), the fields of velocity, egress time, packing fraction, and
kinetic stress are analysed in this study. While in pedestrian dynamics, the
placement of an obstacle in front of a narrow gate may reduce the stress near
the exit and enable a more efficient egress, the effect is opposite for our
soft grains. Placing an obstacle above the orifice always led to a reduction of
the flow rates, in some cases even to increased clogging probabilities.

dissimilarity, affecting the classification accuracy. To address the above

frequency learning to overcome the loss of phase information caused by real

brightness of an image to a point in the spectrum (the DC component),
alleviating the effects of uneven brightness by decoupling image content and
brightness. Moreover, the image patch scrambling module in FFCNet generates
random local spectral blocks, empowering the network to learn long-range and
local diseasespecific features and improving the discriminative ability of hard
samples. We evaluated the proposed FFCNet on an in-house dataset with 2568
colonoscopy images, showing our method achieves high performance outperforming
previous state-of-the art methods with an accuracy of 86:35% and an accuracy of
4.46% higher than the backbone. The project page with code is available at

the ratio between the probabilities of observing n fragments in each event, for
each of the sources, follows a scaling law, similar to the traditional nuclear

We
wonder for how long the mechanism of acceleration of electrons operates in
shells of Novae. In order to put constraints on the time scale of the electron
acceleration, we consider a specific model for the injection and propagation of
electrons within the shell of the recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi. We calculate the
equilibrium spectra of electrons within the Nova shell and the gamma-ray fluxes
produced by these electrons in the comptonization of the soft radiation from
the Red Giant within the Nova binary system and also radiation from the Nova
photosphere. We investigate two component, time dependent model in which a
spherically ejected Nova shell propagates freely in the polar region of the
Nova binary system. But, the shell is significantly decelerated in the dense
equatorial region of the binary system. We discuss the conditions for which
electrons can produce gamma-rays which might be detectable by the present
and/or future gamma-ray observatories. It is concluded that freely expending
shells of Novae in the optimal case (strongly magnetised shell and efficiency
of acceleration of electrons of the order of 10%) can produce TeV gamma-rays
within the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescpe Array only within 1-2 years
after explosion. On the other hand, decelerated shells of Novae have a chance
to be detected during the whole recurrence period of RS Ophiuchi, i.e. ~15
years.

three-dimensional (3D) curvature on the polarization profile of nominally
uncharged 180{\deg} domain walls in LiNbO3 is studied using second-harmonic
generation microscopy and 3D polarimetry analysis. Correlations between the
domain wall curvature and the variation of its internal polarization unfold in
the form of modulations of the N\'eel-like character, which we attribute to the
flexoelectric effect. While the N\'eel-like character originates mainly from
the tilting of the domain wall, the internal polarization adjusts its
orientation due to the synergetic upshot of dipolar and monopolar bound charges
and their variation with the 3D curvature. Our results show that curved
interfaces in solid crystals may offer a rich playground for tailoring
nanoscale polar states.

the previous best speeds for these tasks, which were obtained by top-down
minimal approximant bases techniques, and complements the theory of efficient
interpolation over free skew polynomial modules by the bottom-up KNH approach.
In contrast to the top-down approach the bottom-up KNH algorithm has no
requirements on the interpolation points and thus does not require any

Harmonizer contains a neural network for filter argument prediction and several

are confirmed. Some of these mergers are suspected to have occurred in star
clusters. The density of black holes at the cores of these clusters is so high
that mergers can occur through a few generations forming increasingly massive
black holes. These conditions also make it possible for three black holes to
interact, most likely via single-binary encounters. In this paper, we present a
first study of how often such encounters can happen in nuclear star clusters
(NSCs) as a function of redshift, and whether these encounters are observable
by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. This study focuses on effectively
hyperbolic encounters leaving out the resonant encounters. We find that in NSCs
single-binary encounters occur rarely compared to binary mergers, and that
hyperbolic encounters most likely produce the strongest GW emission below the
observation band of terrestrial GW detectors. While several of them can be
expected to occur per year with peak energy in the LISA band, their amplitude
is low, and detection by LISA seems improbable.

(1) support creating valid and consistent annotations with increased speed, (2)
significantly improve the user experience of the annotator, (3) support
collaboration among annotators, and (4) provide an open-source and easily

Repository: https://github.com/zjukg/DUET",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to predict unseen classes whose samples have
never appeared during training. One of the most effective and widely used
semantic information for zero-shot image classification are attributes which
are annotations for class-level visual characteristics. However, the current
methods often fail to discriminate those subtle visual distinctions between
images due to not only the shortage of fine-grained annotations, but also the
attribute imbalance and co-occurrence. In this paper, we present a
transformer-based end-to-end ZSL method named DUET, which integrates latent
semantic knowledge from the pre-trained language models (PLMs) via a
self-supervised multi-modal learning paradigm. Specifically, we (1) developed a
cross-modal semantic grounding network to investigate the model's capability of
disentangling semantic attributes from the images; (2) applied an
attribute-level contrastive learning strategy to further enhance the model's
discrimination on fine-grained visual characteristics against the attribute
co-occurrence and imbalance; (3) proposed a multi-task learning policy for
considering multi-model objectives. We find that our DUET can achieve
state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSL benchmarks and a knowledge

the performance on nighttime images are less satisfactory due to the

present an add-on module called dual image-adaptive learnable filters
(DIAL-Filters) to improve the semantic segmentation in nighttime driving
conditions, aiming at exploiting the intrinsic features of driving-scene images
under different illuminations. DIAL-Filters consist of two parts, including an
image-adaptive processing module (IAPM) and a learnable guided filter (LGF).
With DIAL-Filters, we design both unsupervised and supervised frameworks for
nighttime driving-scene segmentation, which can be trained in an end-to-end
manner. Specifically, the IAPM module consists of a small convolutional neural
network with a set of differentiable image filters, where each image can be
adaptively enhanced for better segmentation with respect to the different
illuminations. The LGF is employed to enhance the output of segmentation
network to get the final segmentation result. The DIAL-Filters are light-weight
and efficient and they can be readily applied for both daytime and nighttime
images. Our experiments show that DAIL-Filters can significantly improve the
supervised segmentation performance on ACDC_Night and NightCity datasets, while
it demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised nighttime

that the considered systems exhibit a high-order synchronization through

anharmonicity of the nonlinear interaction between the oscillators the system
exhibits phonon blockade in the phase locking regime which is a pure
nonclassical effect and has not been observed in the classical domain. We also
demonstrate that for coupled anharmonic oscillators the system shows a multiple
resonance phase locking behaviour due to nonlinear interaction. We point out
that the synchronization blockade arises due to strong anticorrelation between
the oscillators which leads to phonon antibunching in the same parametric
regime. In the anharmonic oscillator case we illustrate the simultaneous
occurrence of bunching and antibunching effects as a consequence of
simultaneous negative and positive correlation between the anharmonic
oscillators. We examine the aforementioned characteristic features in the
frequency entrainment of the oscillators using power spectrum where one can
observe normal mode splitting and Mollow triplet in the strong coupling regime.

top retrieval result, we argue that in the case of a large-scale database a
more accurate model may be found within a neighborhood of the descriptor. More
importantly, we propose that the distinctiveness deficiency of shape
descriptors at the instance level can be compensated by a geometry-based
re-ranking of its neighborhood. Our approach first leverages the discriminative
power of learned representations to distinguish between different categories of
models and then uses a novel robust point set distance metric to re-rank the
CAD neighborhood, enabling fine-grained retrieval in a large shape database.
Evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that our geometry-based re-ranking is
a conceptually simple but highly effective method that can lead to a
significant improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

rationalized considering current models of incompressible interfacial flow and
deepened developing an ad hoc model which considers the contribution of tiny

Standard linking arguments based on decompositions of $H^1_0(\Omega)$ into

linking structures based on splittings of $H^1_0(\Omega)$ into nonlinear

prove non-uniqueness of PASOD-frame under certain condition of the given frame.
We also go on to characterize the set of all PASOD-pairs and give several

efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's
interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,
CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same
cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in
a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to
represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in
which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.
But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote
anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast
them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (""cryptographic nonce"") on each
ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.
But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or
does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to
conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on
each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not
compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method
allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.
The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection
does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system
misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results
when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and
retrieval were accurate.

Gaussian random fields. This allows us to estimate the uncertainties of the
unknowns by approximating their posterior covariance with a quasi-Newton
method. We first test the method for synthetic noisy images of 2D flows and
observe that the method successfully reconstructs and segments the noisy
synthetic images with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3. Then we conduct a
magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) experiment to acquire images of an
axisymmetric flow for low ($\simeq 6$) and high ($>30$) SNRs. We show that the
method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the low SNR images,
producing noiseless velocity fields and a smooth segmentation, with negligible
errors compared with the high SNR images. This amounts to a reduction of the
total scanning time by a factor of 27. At the same time, the method provides
additional knowledge about the physics of the flow (e.g. pressure), and
addresses the shortcomings of MRV (low spatial resolution and partial volume
effects) that otherwise hinder the accurate estimation of wall shear stresses.
Although the implementation of the method is restricted to 2D steady planar and
axisymmetric flows, the formulation applies immediately to 3D steady flows and
naturally extends to 3D periodic and unsteady flows.

  edge-basedness of unrooted phylogenetic networks",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phylogenetic networks which are, as opposed to trees, suitable to describe
processes like hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, play a substantial
role in evolutionary research. However, while non-treelike events need to be
taken into account, they are relatively rare, which implies that biologically
relevant networks are often assumed to be similar to trees in the sense that
they can be obtained by taking a tree and adding some additional edges. This
observation led to the concept of so-called tree-based networks, which recently
gained substantial interest in the literature. Unfortunately, though,
identifying such networks in the unrooted case is an NP-complete problem.
Therefore, classes of networks for which tree-basedness can be guaranteed are
of the utmost interest.
  The most prominent such class is formed by so-called edge-based networks,
which have a close relationship to generalized series-parallel graphs known
from graph theory. They can be identified in linear time and are in some
regards biologically more plausible than general tree-based networks. While
concerning the latter proximity measures for general networks have already been
introduced, such measures are not yet available for edge-basedness. This means
that for an arbitrary unrooted network, the ""distance"" to the nearest
edge-based network could so far not be determined. The present manuscript fills
this gap by introducing two classes of proximity measures for edge-basedness,
one based on the given network itself and one based on its so-called leaf
shrink graph (LS graph). Both classes contain four different proximity
measures, whose similarities and differences we study subsequently.

reconstruction of sea surface dynamics is a challenging inverse problem. While
satellite altimetry provides a direct observation of the sea surface height
(SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of sea surface currents,
the associated sampling pattern prevents from retrieving fine-scale sea surface
dynamics, typically below a 10-day time scale. By contrast, other satellite
sensors provide higher-resolution observations of sea surface tracers such as
sea surface temperature (SST). Multimodal inversion schemes then arise as an
appealing strategy. Though theoretical evidence supports the existence of an
explicit relationship between sea surface temperature and sea surface dynamics
under specific dynamical regimes, the generalization to the variety of upper
ocean dynamical regimes is complex. Here, we investigate this issue from a
physics-informed learning perspective. We introduce a trainable multimodal
inversion scheme for the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from
multi-source satellite-derived observations. The proposed 4DVarNet schemes
combine a variational formulation involving trainable observation and a priori
terms with a trainable gradient-based solver. We report an application to the
reconstruction of the divergence-free component of sea surface dynamics from
satellite-derived SSH and SST data. An observing system simulation experiment
for a Gulf Stream region supports the relevance of our approach compared with
state-of-the-art schemes. We report relative improvement greater than 50%
compared with the operational altimetry product in terms of root mean square
error and resolved space-time scales. We discuss further the application and
extension of the proposed approach for the reconstruction and forecasting of
geophysical dynamics from irregularly-sampled satellite observations.

assimilation of real-time data requires effective geological modeling and
mathematically robust parameterization. We propose a generative adversarial
deep neural network (GAN), trained to reproduce geologically consistent 2D
sections of fluvial successions. Offline training produces a fast GAN-based
approximation of complex geology parameterized as a 60-dimensional model vector
with standard Gaussian distribution of each component. Probabilistic forecasts
are generated using an ensemble of equiprobable model vector realizations. A
forward-modeling sequence, including a GAN, converts the initial (prior)
ensemble of realizations into EM log predictions. An ensemble smoother
minimizes statistical misfits between predictions and real-time data, yielding
an update of model vectors and reduced uncertainty around the well. Updates can
be then translated to probabilistic predictions of facies and resistivities.
The present paper demonstrates a workflow for geosteering in an outcrop-based,
synthetic fluvial succession. In our example, the method reduces uncertainty

a simple module for fine-grained few-shot classification. Our objective is to
localize the class-wise discriminative regions by highlighting channels
encoding distinct information of the class. Specifically, TDM learns
task-specific channel weights based on two novel components: Support Attention
Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM produces a support weight to
represent channel-wise discriminative power for each class. Still, since the
SAM is basically only based on the labeled support sets, it can be vulnerable
to bias toward such support set. Therefore, we propose QAM which complements
SAM by yielding a query weight that grants more weight to object-relevant
channels for a given query image. By combining these two weights, a class-wise
task-specific channel weight is defined. The weights are then applied to
produce task-adaptive feature maps more focusing on the discriminative details.
Our experiments validate the effectiveness of TDM and its complementary
benefits with prior methods in fine-grained few-shot classification.

low-power deep neural networks, which is suitable to be implemented on
low-power mobile/edge devices. As such devices have limited memory storage,
neural pruning on SNNs has been widely explored in recent years. Most existing
SNN pruning works focus on shallow SNNs (2~6 layers), however, deeper SNNs (>16
layers) are proposed by state-of-the-art SNN works, which is difficult to be
compatible with the current SNN pruning work. To scale up a pruning technique
towards deep SNNs, we investigate Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) which states
that dense networks contain smaller subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that
achieve comparable performance to the dense networks. Our studies on LTH reveal
that the winning tickets consistently exist in deep SNNs across various
datasets and architectures, providing up to 97% sparsity without huge
performance degradation. However, the iterative searching process of LTH brings
a huge training computational cost when combined with the multiple timesteps of
SNNs. To alleviate such heavy searching cost, we propose Early-Time (ET) ticket
where we find the important weight connectivity from a smaller number of
timesteps. The proposed ET ticket can be seamlessly combined with a common
pruning techniques for finding winning tickets, such as Iterative Magnitude
Pruning (IMP) and Early-Bird (EB) tickets. Our experiment results show that the
proposed ET ticket reduces search time by up to 38% compared to IMP or EB
methods. Code is available at Github.

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative model-based motion prediction techniques have recently realized
predicting controlled human motions, such as predicting multiple upper human
body motions with similar lower-body motions. However, to achieve this, the
state-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions
to seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control
over the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
to learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction.
Our network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture
to model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the
corresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the
inductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables
in two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each
partial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two
types of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one
portion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by
sampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a
sampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable
predictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by
flexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental
results and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of
predicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

proliferation of data-driven algorithms, such as deep learning-based

high-quality training, validation and testing datasets are particularly needed.
Volumetric data is a very important resource in medicine, as it ranges from
disease diagnoses to therapy monitoring. When the dataset is sufficient, models
can be trained to help doctors with these tasks. Unfortunately, there are
scenarios and applications where large amounts of data is unavailable. For
example, in the medical field, rare diseases and privacy issues can lead to
restricted data availability. In non-medical fields, the high cost of obtaining
a sufficient amount of high-quality data can also be a concern. A solution to
these problems can be the generation of synthetic data to perform data
augmentation in combination with other more traditional methods of data
augmentation. Therefore, most of the publications on 3D Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) are within the medical domain. The existence of mechanisms to
generate realistic synthetic data is a good asset to overcome this challenge,
especially in healthcare, as the data must be of good quality and close to
reality, i.e. realistic, and without privacy issues. In this review, we provide
a summary of works that generate realistic 3D synthetic data using GANs. We
therefore outline GAN-based methods in these areas with common architectures,
advantages and disadvantages. We present a novel taxonomy, evaluations,

method that can effectively alleviate performance degeneration even with

quantization impact of each weight on others, we perform an orthonormal

minimize the loss of the information from the original weights/activations. We
further perform progressive layer-wise quantization from the bottom layer to
the top, so that quantization at each layer reflects the quantized
distributions of weights and activations at previous layers. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on various benchmark datasets against strong neural

time-consuming calculation for Hessian-inverse. We propose an approximation
method through transforming the problem into an optimization in the Krylov

model using basic visual representations. The U-net model has been selected as
the prediction kernel to generate future visual representations of the scene
using an image-to-image regression approach. A method has been implemented to
extract vehicle positions from the generated graphical representations to
achieve subpixel resolution. The method has been trained and evaluated using
the PREVENTION dataset, an on-board sensor dataset. Different network
configurations and scene representations have been evaluated. This study found
that U-net with 6 depth levels using a linear terminal layer and a Gaussian
representation of the vehicles is the best performing configuration. The use of
lane markings was found to produce no improvement in prediction performance.
The average prediction error is 0.47 and 0.38 meters and the final prediction
error is 0.76 and 0.53 meters for longitudinal and lateral coordinates,
respectively, for a predicted trajectory length of 2.0 seconds. The prediction
error is up to 50% lower compared to the baseline method.

  Measurement (ESEM) (ESEM '22)",,"10.1145/3544902.3546252",,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Teamwork, coordination, and communication are a prerequisite for
the timely completion of a software project. Meetings as a facilitator for
coordination and communication are an established medium for information
exchange. Analyses of meetings in software projects have shown that certain
interactions in these meetings, such as proactive statements followed by
supportive ones, influence the mood and motivation of a team, which in turn
affects its productivity. So far, however, research has focused only on certain
interactions at a detailed level, requiring a complex and fine-grained analysis
of a meeting itself.
  Aim: In this paper, we investigate meetings from a more abstract perspective,
focusing on the polarity of the statements, i.e., whether they appear to be
positive, negative, or neutral.
  Method: We analyze the relationship between the polarity of statements in
meetings and different social aspects, including conflicts as well as the mood
before and after a meeting.
  Results: Our results emerge from 21 student software project meetings and
show some interesting insights: (1) Positive mood before a meeting is both
related to the amount of positive statements in the beginning, as well as
throughout the whole meeting, (2) negative mood before the meeting only
influences the amount of negative statements in the first quarter of the
meeting, but not the whole meeting, and (3) the amount of positive and negative
statements during the meeting has no influence on the mood afterwards.
  Conclusions: We conclude that the behaviour in meetings might rather
influence short-term emotional states (feelings) than long-term emotional
states (mood), which are more important for the project.

processes that are too slow to observe in real time. However, playing a long
time-lapse sequence back as a video often results in distracting flicker due to
random effects, such as weather, as well as cyclic effects, such as the
day-night cycle. We introduce the problem of disentangling time-lapse sequences
in a way that allows separate, after-the-fact control of overall trends, cyclic
effects, and random effects in the images, and describe a technique based on
data-driven generative models that achieves this goal. This enables us to
""re-render"" the sequences in ways that would not be possible with the input
images alone. For example, we can stabilize a long sequence to focus on plant
growth over many months, under selectable, consistent weather.
  Our approach is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that are
conditioned with the time coordinate of the time-lapse sequence. Our
architecture and training procedure are designed so that the networks learn to
model random variations, such as weather, using the GAN's latent space, and to
disentangle overall trends and cyclic variations by feeding the conditioning
time label to the model using Fourier features with specific frequencies.
  We show that our models are robust to defects in the training data, enabling
us to amend some of the practical difficulties in capturing long time-lapse

Strong edge state variations in the stacking region are first revealed by

  Tao","Dynamic Contrastive Distillation for Image-Text Retrieval",,,,,"cs.MM cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Although the vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) equipped cross-modal
image-text retrieval (ITR) has achieved remarkable progress in the past two
years, it suffers from a major drawback: the ever-increasing size of VLP models
restricts its deployment to real-world search scenarios (where the high latency
is unacceptable). To alleviate this problem, we present a novel plug-in dynamic
contrastive distillation (DCD) framework to compress the large VLP models for
the ITR task. Technically, we face the following two challenges: 1) the typical
uni-modal metric learning approach is difficult to directly apply to the
cross-modal tasks, due to the limited GPU memory to optimize too many negative
samples during handling cross-modal fusion features. 2) it is inefficient to
static optimize the student network from different hard samples, which have
different effects on distillation learning and student network optimization. We
try to overcome these challenges from two points. First, to achieve multi-modal
contrastive learning, and balance the training costs and effects, we propose to
use a teacher network to estimate the difficult samples for students, making
the students absorb the powerful knowledge from pre-trained teachers, and
master the knowledge from hard samples. Second, to dynamic learn from hard
sample pairs, we propose dynamic distillation to dynamically learn samples of
different difficulties, from the perspective of better balancing the difficulty
of knowledge and students' self-learning ability. We successfully apply our
proposed DCD strategy to two state-of-the-art vision-language pretrained
models, i.e. ViLT and METER. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K
benchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our DCD framework.
Encouragingly, we can speed up the inference at least 129$\times$ compared to
the existing ITR models.

While the external forward shock of the superbubble may account for
acceleration of particles up to 100 TeV, internal primary shocks such as
supernova remnants expanding in the low density medium or the collective wind
termination shock which forms around a young compact cluster provide more
favourable channels to accelerate protons up to 1 PeV, and possibly beyond.
Under reasonable conditions, clustered supernovae launching powerful shocks
into the magnetised wind of a young and compact massive star cluster are found
to be the most promising systems to accelerate protons above 10 PeV. On the

found to be much less effective than claimed in previous works, with a maximum

unexplored territory, especially for discrete interfaces. On the other hand, on
the basis of a mean-curvature motion heuristics and simulations, one expects
convergence to equilibrium to occur on time-scales of order $\approx

  We study the single-flip Glauber dynamics for lozenge tilings of a finite

measure is the uniform measure on admissible tilings. At equilibrium, by the
limit shape theorem, the height function concentrates as $\delta\to0$ around a

functional. Despite some partial mathematical results, the conjecture
$T_{mix}=\delta^{-2+o(1)}$ has been proven, so far, only in the situation where
$\phi$ is an affine function. In this work, we prove the conjecture under the

consistent and equal provision of public services, including transport for

method combining geometrical analysis and information-theoretic measures, we
analyse the accessibility to public transport in terms of the spatial coverage
of the transport nodes (stops) and the quality of service at these nodes across
different areas. Furthermore, using a network clustering procedure, we also
characterise the land-use pattern of those areas and relate that to their
public transport accessibility. Using Singapore as a case study, we find that
the commercial areas in the CBD area expectedly have excellent accessibility
and the residential areas also have good to very good accessibility. However,
not every residential area is equally accessible. While the spatial coverage of
stops in these areas is very good, the quality of service indicates substantial
variation among different regions, with high contrast between the central and
eastern areas compared to the others in the west and north of the city-state.
We believe this kind of analysis could yield a good understanding of the
current level of public transport services across the urban system, and their
disparity will provide valuable and actionable insights into the future

Au-enhanced exfoliation technique provides an effective strategy for
preparation of large-scale 2D crystals, the high cost of gold hinders this
method from being widely adopted in industrial applications. In addition,
direct Au contact could significantly quench photoluminescence (PL) emission in
2D semiconductors. It is therefore crucial to find alternative metals that can
replace gold to achieve efficient exfoliation of 2D materials. Here, we present
a one-step Ag-assisted method that can efficiently exfoliate many large-area 2D
monolayers, where the yield ratio is comparable to Au-enhanced exfoliation
method. Differing from Au film, however, the surface roughness of as-prepared
Ag films on SiO2/Si substrate is much higher, which facilitates the generation
of surface plasmons resulting from the nanostructures formed on the rough Ag
surface. More interestingly, the strong coupling between 2D semiconductor
crystals (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2) and Ag film leads to a unique PL enhancement that
has not been observed in other mechanical exfoliation techniques, which can be
mainly attributed to enhanced light-matter interaction as a result of extended
propagation of surface plasmonic polariton (SPP). Our work provides a
lower-cost and universal Ag-assisted exfoliation method, while at the same
offering enhanced SPP-matter interactions.

of a sub-equipartition magnetic field in the accretion flow of a black hole
binary system. Using X-ray observations of the three well-known sources
A0620-00, XTE J1118+480 and V404 Cyg during the quiescent state, we compare the
theoretically expected spectral shape with the observed data in order to verify
that the parameters of the sub-equipartition model are plausible. In all three
cases, we find that it is possible to reproduce the spectral shape of the X-ray
observations with a sub-equipartition flow. These findings support the idea
that the quiescent state spectrum of X-ray binary systems is produced by a
weakly-magnetized accretion flow. A sub-equipartition flow would pose a
significant challenge to our current understanding of jet-launching, which
relies on the presence of a strong magnetic field to power the jet.

logical reasoning, requires awareness of particular logical structures. The
passage-level logical relations represent entailment or contradiction between
propositional units (e.g., a concluding sentence). However, such structures are
unexplored as current QA systems focus on entity-based relations. In this work,
we propose logic structural-constraint modeling to solve the logical reasoning
QA and introduce discourse-aware graph networks (DAGNs). The networks first
construct logic graphs leveraging in-line discourse connectives and generic
logic theories, then learn logic representations by end-to-end evolving the
logic relations with an edge-reasoning mechanism and updating the graph
features. This pipeline is applied to a general encoder, whose fundamental
features are joined with the high-level logic features for answer prediction.
Experiments on three textual logical reasoning datasets demonstrate the
reasonability of the logical structures built in DAGNs and the effectiveness of
the learned logic features. Moreover, zero-shot transfer results show the
features' generality to unseen logical texts.

contributing to surgical outcome enhancement and clinical risk reduction.
However, the varying issues in segmenting the different relevant structures in

This paper proposes a semantic segmentation network, termed DeepPyramid, that
can deal with these challenges using three novelties: (1) a Pyramid View Fusion
module which provides a varying-angle global view of the surrounding region
centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional feature map; (2) a
Deformable Pyramid Reception module which enables a wide deformable receptive
field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of interest;
and (3) a dedicated Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale
semantic feature maps. Combined, we show that these modules can effectively
boost semantic segmentation performance, especially in the case of
transparency, deformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. We
demonstrate that our approach performs at a state-of-the-art level and
outperforms a number of existing methods with a large margin (3.66% overall
improvement in intersection over union compared to the best rival approach).

Re-scattering via intermediate electroweak would-be-Goldstone bosons dominate
at high energies, as the corresponding loop diagrams with these intermediate
bosons scale like $\mathcal{O}(s^2/v^4)$ in the chiral effective counting. In
the present article, we focus our attention on fermion-loop corrections which
scale like $\mathcal{O}(M_{\rm Fer}^2 s/v^4)$ in the Higgs Effective Field
Theory (HEFT). Although this dependency is formally suppressed for $s\to\infty$
with respect to that from boson loops, the large top mass can lead to a
numerical competition between fermion and boson loops at intermediate energies
of the order of a few TeV. For the study of these fermion effects we have
calculated the imaginary part induced by loops of top and bottom quarks in $W^+
W^-\to W^+W^-$ elastic scattering and compared it to the loop contributions
from purely bosonic loops. We have examined the dependence of both amplitudes
on the effective couplings, allowing an $\mathcal{O}(10 \%)$ deviation from the
SM. In some cases, boson loops dominate over top and bottom corrections, as
expected. However, we find that there are regions in the space of effective
parameters that yield a significant -- and even dominant -- imaginary
contribution from fermion loops. In addition to our conclusions for the general
HEFT, we also provide analyses particularized to some benchmark points in the

alleviated. Second, a boundary guided semi-push-pull loss is developed to only
pull the normal features together while pushing the abnormal features apart

down the inverse temperature of the black hole, meaning that a rainbow rotating

  Byzantine failures","50 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The implementation of registers from (potentially) weaker registers is a
classical problem in the theory of distributed computing. Since Lamport's
pioneering work [13], this problem has been extensively studied in the context
of asynchronous processes with crash failures. In this paper, we investigate
this problem in the context of Byzantine process failures, with and without
process signatures.
  We first prove that, without signatures, there is no wait-free linearizable
implementation of a 1-writer n-reader register from atomic 1-writer 1-reader
registers. In fact, we show a stronger result, namely, even under the
assumption that the writer can only crash and at most one reader can be
malicious, there is no linearizable implementation of a 1-writer n-reader
register from atomic 1-writer (n-1)-reader registers that ensures that every
correct process eventually completes its operations. In light of this
impossibility result, we give two implementations of a 1-writer n-reader
register from atomic 1-writer 1-reader registers that work under different
assumptions. The first implementation is linearizable (under any combination of
process failures), but it guarantees that every correct process eventually
completes its operations only under the assumption that the writer is correct
or no reader is malicious -- thus matching the impossibility result. The second
implementation assumes process signatures; it is bounded wait-free and
linearizable under any combination of process failures. Finally, we show that
without process signatures, even if we assume that the writer is correct and at
most one of the readers can be malicious, it is impossible to guarantee that
every correct reader completes each read operation in a bounded number of
steps.

interesting null states in a general $\xi=0$ boost multiplet. We specify these

fit the spectral energy distribution as a function of the radius at five
wavelengths from 0.9 to 9\,mm, using a simple power law and a physical model
based on an analytic description of radiative transfer that includes isothermal
scattering. We considered eight dust populations and compared the models'
performance using Bayesian evidence. Our analysis shows that the moderately
high optical depth ($\tau$>1) at $\lambda \leq$ 1.3 mm in the dust rings
artificially lower the millimeter spectral index, which should therefore not be
considered as a reliable direct proxy of the dust properties and especially the
grain size. We find that the outer disk is composed of small grains on the
order of 200 $\mu$m with no significant difference between rings at 66 and 100
au and the adjacent gaps, while in the innermost 30 au, larger grains
($\geq$mm) could be present. We show that the assumptions on the dust
composition have a strong impact on the derived surface densities and grain
size. In particular, increasing the porosity of the grains to 80\% results in a
total dust mass about five times higher with respect to grains with 25\%
porosity. Finally, we find that the derived opacities as a function of
frequency deviate from a simple power law and that grains with a lower porosity
seem to better reproduce the observations of HD163296. While we do not find
evidence of differential trapping in the rings of HD163296, our overall results
are consistent with the postulated presence of giant planets affecting the dust
temperature structure and surface density, and possibly originating a

hard to apply them to continuously streaming data and results in large memory

method to compute dispersions and spatial mode profiles of spin waves
propagating in waveguides with translationally invariant equilibrium
magnetization. Using a finite-element method (FEM) allowed to model
two-dimensional waveguide cross sections of arbitrary shape but only finite
size. Here, we extend our FEM propagating-wave dynamic-matrix approach from
finite waveguides to the important practical cases of infinitely-extended mono-
and multilayers of arbitrary spacing and thickness. To obtain the mode profiles
and frequencies, the linearized equation of motion of magnetization is solved
as an eigenvalue problem only on a one-dimensional line-trace mesh, defined
along the normal direction of the layers. Being an important contribution in
multilayer systems, we introduce interlayer-exchange interaction into our FEM
approach. With the calculation of dynamic dipolar fields being the main focus
of this paper, we also extend the previously presented plane-wave
Fredkin-Koehler method to calculate the dipolar potential of spin waves in
infinite layers. The major benefit of this method is that it avoids the
discretization of any non-magnetic material, such as non-magnetic spacers in
multilayers. Therefore, the computational effort becomes completely independent
on the spacer thicknesses. Furthermore, it keeps the resulting discretized
eigenvalue problem sparse, which therefore, inherits a comparably low
arithmetic complexity. As a validation of our method (implemented into the
open-source finite-element micromagnetic package TetraX), we present results
for various systems and compare them with theoretical predictions as well as
with established finite-difference numerical methods. We believe this method
offers an efficient and versatile tool to calculate spin-wave dispersions in
layered magnetic systems.

This non-central potential can be solved by an extension of techniques used in

azimuthal angle $\varphi$ and polar angle $\theta$ as
$P_\lambda^m(\cos\theta){\rm e}^{im\varphi}$ where $P_\lambda^m$ is the

$\lambda=\lambda_i^m$ ($i=0,1,3,\dots$) that depend on $m$ and $\theta_0$. Each
$\lambda_i^m$ has an infinite sequence of eigenenergies $E_n(\lambda_i^m)$,
with corresponding radial parts of eigenfunctions. In a spherical box the
discrete energy spectrum is determined by the zeros of the spherical Bessel
functions. For several $\theta_0$ we demonstrate the validity of Weyl's
continuous estimate ${\cal N}_W$ for the exact number of states $\cal N$ up to

examine the behavior of bound states in a well of finite depth $U_0$, and find
the critical value $U_c(\theta_0)$ when all bound states disappear. The radial

diverges as a (possibly $\lambda$-dependent) power law as $U_0$ approaches the

For the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training

motivate a text-based KGC model and a structure-based KGC model to learn with
each other to fuse respective knowledge into unity. To exploit text and
structure features together in depth, we partition knowledge within models into
two nonoverlapping parts: expressiveness ability on the training set and
generalization ability upon unobserved queries. For the former, we motivate
these two text-based and structure-based models to learn from each other on the
training sets. And for the generalization ability, we propose a novel knowledge
fusion strategy derived by the Variational EM (VEM) algorithm, during which we
also apply a graph densification operation to alleviate the sparse graph
problem further. Our graph densification is derived by VEM algorithm. Due to
the convergence of EM algorithm, we guarantee the increase of likelihood
function theoretically with less being impacted by noisy injected triples
heavily. By combining these two fusion methods and graph densification, we
propose the VEM$^2$L framework finally. Both detailed theoretical evidence, as

question. Hence, it is important to understand users' participation in privacy

work elaborates on the interplay between users' engagement and their privacy
practices in SO. Particularly, it analyses developers' self-disclosure

by (i) analysing SO data from 1239 cybersecurity-tagged questions along with
7048 user profiles, and (ii) conducting an anonymous online survey (N=64).
Results: About 33% of the questions we retrieved had no answer, whereas more
than 50% had no accepted answer. We observed that ""proactive"" users tend to
disclose significantly less information in their profiles than ""reactive"" and
""unengaged"" ones. However, no correlations were found between these engagement

specific physical laws. In the context of a Physical Theory, the physical
quantities and the physical laws are described, respectively, by suitable
geometrical objects and relations between these objects. These relations are
expressed with systems of (mainly second order) differential equations. The
solution of these equations is frequently a formidable task, either because the
dynamical equations cannot be integrated by standard methods or because the
defined dynamical system is non-integrable. Therefore, it is important that we
have a systematic and reliable method to determine their integrability. This
has led to the development of several (algebraic or geometric) methods, which
determine if a dynamical system is integrable/superintegrable or not. Most of
these methods concern the first integrals (FIs), that is, quantities that are
constant along the evolution of the system. FIs are important, because they can
be used to reduce the order of the system of the dynamical equations and, if
there are `enough' of them, even to determine its solution by means of
quadratures. In the latter case, the dynamical system is said to be Liouville
integrable and it is associated with a canonical Lagrangian, whose kinetic
energy defines a metric tensor known as kinetic metric. It is proved that there
is a close relation between the geometric symmetries (collineations and Killing
tensors) of this metric and the quantities defining the FIs. This
correspondence makes it possible to use the results of Differential Geometry in
the study of the integrability of dynamical systems. In this thesis, we study
this correspondence and geometrize the determination of FIs by developing a new
geometric method to compute them.

Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system and the compressible Euler-Maxwell system which
both capture the complex dynamics of plasmas under the self-consistent
electromagnetic interactions at the kinetic and fluid levels, respectively. It
has remained a long-standing open problem to rigorously justify the
hydrodynamic limit from the former to the latter as the Knudsen number
$\varepsilon$ tends to zero. In this paper we give an affirmative answer to the
problem for smooth solutions to both systems near constant equilibrium in the
whole space in case when only the dynamics of electrons is taken into account.
The explicit rate of convergence in $\varepsilon$ over an almost global time
interval is also obtained for well-prepared data. For the proof, one of main
difficulties occurs to the cubic growth of large velocities due to the action
of the classical transport operator on local Maxwellians and we develop new
$\varepsilon$-dependent energy estimates basing on the macro-micro
decomposition to characterize the asymptotic limit in the compressible setting.

To define an accurate segmentation of the primary tumor (GTVp) of oropharyngeal
cancer patients (OPC), simultaneous assessment of different image modalities is
needed, and each image volume is explored slice-by-slice from different
orientations. Moreover, the manual fixed boundary of segmentation neglects the
spatial uncertainty known to occur in tumor delineation. This study proposes a
novel automatic deep learning (DL) model to assist radiation oncologists in a
slice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation on registered FDG PET/CT images. We
included 138 OPC patients treated with (chemo)radiation in our institute. Our
DL framework exploits both inter and intra-slice context. Sequences of 3
consecutive 2D slices of concatenated FDG PET/CT images and GTVp contours were
used as input. A 3-fold cross validation was performed three times, training on
sequences extracted from the Axial (A), Sagittal (S), and Coronal (C) plane of
113 patients. Since consecutive sequences in a volume contain overlapping
slices, each slice resulted in three outcome predictions that were averaged. In
the A, S, and C planes, the output shows areas with different probabilities of
predicting the tumor. The performance of the models was assessed on 25 patients
at different probability thresholds using the mean Dice Score Coefficient
(DSC). Predictions were the closest to the ground truth at a probability
threshold of 0.9 (DSC of 0.70 in the A, 0.77 in the S, and 0.80 in the C
plane). The promising results of the proposed DL model show that the
probability maps on registered FDG PET/CT images could guide radiation
oncologists in a slice-by-slice adaptive GTVp segmentation.

yet it remains one of the enduring enigmas of our times. Here we show that Dark
Energy can be used to solve 2 tantalizing mysteries of the observable universe.
We build on existing models of Dark Energy linked to neutrino masses. In these
models Dark Energy can undergo Phase Transitions and form Black Holes. Here we
look at the implications of the family structure of neutrinos for the phase
transitions in dark energy and associated peaks in black hole formation. It has
been previously shown that one of these peaks in Black Hole formation is
associated with the observed peak in Quasar formation. Here, we predict that
there will also be an earlier peak in the Dark Energy Black Holes at high
redshifts. These Dark Energy Black Holes formed at high redshifts are
Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs).These Dark Energy Black Holes at large
redshift can help explain both the EDGES observations and the observations of
large Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z \sim 7$. The existence
of an earlier phase of Dark Energy Black Holes take care of some current
challenges to theory implied by existing astronomical data and also helps us
look for these Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts as predicted here
through targeted searches for these Black Holes at the redshifts $z \sim 18$.
There is a slight dependence of the location of the peak on the lightest
neutrino mass - so the peak may be located at a slightly lower value of the
redshift. This may actually enable a measurement of the lightest neutrino mass.
Finding these Dark Energy Black Holes of Intermediate Mass should be within the
reach of upcoming observations - particularly with the James Webb Space
Telescope - but perhaps also through the use of other innovative techniques
focusing specifically on the redshifts around $z \sim 18$.

been widely exploited in a plethora of applications such as electro-optical

Casimir force modulation has been hindered by difficulty in achieving high
modulation signals due to the broadband nature of the Casimir interaction. Here
we propose and investigate two configurations that allow for in-situ modulation
of Casimir forces through electrical gating of a metal-insulator-semiconductor
(MIS) junction comprised of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials. By
switching the gate voltage on and off, a force modulation of > 400 pN is
predicted due to substantive charge carrier accumulation in the TCO layer,
which can be easily measured using state-of-the-art force measurement
techniques in an atomic force microscope (AFM). We further examine the
influence of the oxide layer thickness on the force modulation, suggesting the
importance of the fine control of the oxide layer deposition. Our work provides
a promising pathway for modulating the Casimir effect in-situ with
experimentally measurable force contrast.

spurred much research into integrated soliton generation in microring
resonators at telecom wavelenghts. However, these solitons are generated via
external pumping of a nonlinear medium, which limits system compactness and the
wavelength coverage. Recently it was shown that dissipative Kerr solitons can
be generated directly in the gain medium of mid-infrared semiconductor ring
lasers, where the energy is supplied via electrical pumping. These
technological advances enable a new route towards the monolithic generation of
diverse light states in a wide frequency range, requiring insight into the
conditions necessary for achieving control over the system. In this work, we
study in depth the phase diagram of such systems, exhibiting fast gain dynamics
and no external pumping, and which are described by the complex cubic
Ginzburg-Landau equation with periodic boundary conditions. While previous
studies have focused on large system sizes, we here focus on finite ring sizes
leading to a modification of the phase space and enlargement of the region for
stable soliton formation. In addition to localized, dispersion-less soliton
pulses on a finite background, breather solitons are predicted to occur under
feasible experimental conditions. This enables monolithic generation of
solitions in electrically pumped media such as quantum cascade lasers,
extending the availability of soliton sources to mid-infrared and terahertz
frequencies which are very attractive for molecular spectroscopy, free-space

image segmentation models, such backbone networks for image segmentation are
frequently pre-trained using image classification source datasets, e.g.,
ImageNet. Though image classification datasets could provide the backbone
networks with rich visual features and discriminative ability, they are
incapable of fully pre-training the target model (i.e., backbone+segmentation
modules) in an end-to-end manner. The segmentation modules are left to random
initialization in the fine-tuning process due to the lack of segmentation
labels in classification datasets. In our work, we propose a method that
leverages Pseudo Semantic Segmentation Labels (PSSL), to enable the end-to-end
pre-training for image segmentation models based on classification datasets.
PSSL was inspired by the observation that the explanation results of
classification models, obtained through explanation algorithms such as CAM,
SmoothGrad and LIME, would be close to the pixel clusters of visual objects.
Specifically, PSSL is obtained for each image by interpreting the
classification results and aggregating an ensemble of explanations queried from
multiple classifiers to lower the bias caused by single models. With PSSL for
every image of ImageNet, the proposed method leverages a weighted segmentation
learning procedure to pre-train the segmentation network en masse. Experiment
results show that, with ImageNet accompanied by PSSL as the source dataset, the
proposed end-to-end pre-training strategy successfully boosts the performance

OCRNet-HRNetW18, on a number of segmentation tasks, such as CamVid, VOC-A,

modularization and assemblability of knowledge: given a pretrained network

which handles only a dedicated task and maintains task-specific knowledge
factorized from the source network. Such factor networks are task-wise
disentangled and can be directly assembled, without any fine-tuning, to produce
the more competent combined-task networks. In other words, the factor networks
serve as Lego-brick-like building blocks, allowing us to construct customized
networks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, each factor network comprises
two modules, a common-knowledge module that is task-agnostic and shared by all
factor networks, alongside with a task-specific module dedicated to the factor
network itself. We introduce an information-theoretic objective,
InfoMax-Bottleneck~(IMB), to carry out KF by optimizing the mutual information
between the learned representations and input. Experiments across various
benchmarks demonstrate that, the derived factor networks yield gratifying
performances on not only the dedicated tasks but also disentanglement, while
enjoying much better interpretability and modularity. Moreover, the learned

reliability, it is necessary to properly extract the spatiotemporal features of
infants during GMs. In this study, we propose an automated GMs classification
method, which consists of preprocessing networks that remove unnecessary
background information from GMs videos and adjust the infant's body position,
and a subsequent motion classification network based on a two-stream structure.
The proposed method can efficiently extract the essential spatiotemporal
features for GMs classification while preventing overfitting to irrelevant
information for different recording environments. We validated the proposed
method using videos obtained from 100 infants. The experimental results

the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction of user
preferences. In this paper, we first analyze how message-passing captures the
collaborative effect and propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric,
Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between
a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighbors. After
demonstrating the benefits of leveraging collaborations from neighbors with
higher CIR, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Collaboration-Aware Graph
Convolutional Network (CAGCN), that goes beyond 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman(1-WL) test
in distinguishing non-bipartite-subgraph-isomorphic graphs. Experiments on six
benchmark datasets show that the best CAGCN variant outperforms the most
representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN, by nearly 10% in
Recall@20 and also achieves around 80% speedup. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/YuWVandy/CAGCN.

  attention should we take?",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Attention mechanisms are widely used to dramatically improve deep learning
model performance in various fields. However, their general ability to improve
the performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In
this study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,
squeeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and
multi-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative
physiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting
hypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated
multiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal
deep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention
mechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas
the channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression
problem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with
attention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both
problems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention
mechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the
stand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.

arrays (FPGAs) have been widely adopted, thanks to FPGAs' extraordinary
flexibility. However, with the high flexibility comes the difficulty in design
and optimization. Conventionally, these accelerators are designed with
low-level hardware descriptive languages, which means creating large designs
with complex behavior is extremely difficult. Therefore, high-level synthesis
(HLS) tools were created to simplify hardware designs for FPGAs. They enable
the user to create hardware designs using high-level languages and provide
various optimization directives to help to improve the performance of the
synthesized hardware. However, applying these optimizations to achieve high
performance is time-consuming and usually requires expert knowledge. To address
this difficulty, we present an automated design space exploration tool for
applying HLS optimization directives, called Chimera, which significantly
reduces the human effort and expertise needed for creating high-performance HLS
designs. It utilizes a novel multi-objective exploration method that seamlessly
integrates active learning, evolutionary algorithm, and Thompson sampling,
making it capable of finding a set of optimized designs on a Pareto curve with
only a small number of design points evaluated during the exploration. In the
experiments, in less than 24 hours, this hybrid method explored design points
that have the same or superior performance compared to highly optimized
hand-tuned designs created by expert HLS users from the Rosetta benchmark
suite. In addition to discovering the extreme points, it also explores a Pareto
frontier, where the elbow point can potentially save up to 26\% of Flip-Flop
resource with negligibly higher latency.

disinformation. We build a machine learning model based on multilingual text
embeddings that first determines whether the page mentions a topic of interest,
then estimates the likelihood of the content being malicious, creating a
shortlist of publishers that will be reviewed by human experts. Our system
empowers internal teams to proactively, rather than defensively, blacklist
unsafe content, thus protecting the reputation of the advertisement provider.

the trained neural network model. We show that the decision rules extracted
have the same prediction as the neural network on any input presented to it,
and hence the same accuracy. A key contribution of NN2Rules is that it allows
hidden neuron behavior to be either soft-binary (eg. sigmoid activation) or
rectified linear (ReLU) as opposed to existing decompositional approaches that
were developed with the assumption of soft-binary activation.

be deceived by fabricating spoof images of authorized users. Most recent face
anti-spoofing methods rely on optimized architectures and training objectives
to alleviate the distribution shift between train and test users. However, in
real online scenarios, past data from a user contains valuable information that
could be used to alleviate the distribution shift. We thus introduce OAP
(Online Adaptive Personalization): a lightweight solution which can adapt the
model online using unlabeled data. OAP can be applied on top of most
anti-spoofing methods without the need to store original biometric images.
Through experimental evaluation on the SiW dataset, we show that OAP improves
recognition performance of existing methods on both single video setting and
continual setting, where spoof videos are interleaved with live ones to
simulate spoofing attacks. We also conduct ablation studies to confirm the
design choices for our solution.

architectures to mitigate in real time the atmospheric turbulence effects for
free space optical (FSO) communications. In this paper, we evaluate and comment
on the dynamical communication performances of a FSO mode diversity receiver,
based on a spatial demultiplexer and a silicon photonic coherent combiner, for
an optical link from a GEO satellite to an optical ground station (OGS). We
simulate time series of distorted wavefronts received by the OGS and we show
numerically that the coherent combination of spatial modes mitigate the signal
fading compared to a conventional single mode fiber (SMF) receiver. We verify
this property in a laboratory environment by generating the wavefronts
corresponding to the use case with an atmospheric propagation channel emulator.
Then we modulate the optical carrier prior to the wavefront emulator with 10G
OOK and DPSK data sequences to measure the BER performance of the proposed
receiver during the time series emulation. Finally, we study and comment on the
influence of the number of modes combined and the wavelength multiplexing on
the BER performances. We prove that the mode diversity receiver provide a
higher collection efficiency, has better BER performances and much less
synchronization losses.
