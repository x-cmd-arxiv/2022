Previous algorithms either assume certain separation assumptions, use more

1-dimension problem (also called the sparse Hausdorff moment problem) is a
robust version of the classic Prony's method, and our contribution mainly lies

system defined by the Vandermonde matrix and the Schur polynomial, which allows
us to provide tight perturbation bound independent of the separation and may be
useful in other contexts. To tackle the high dimensional problem, we first
solve the 2-dimensional problem by extending the 1-dimension algorithm and

determines the coordinates of each spike by aligning a 1-d projection of the

interesting class of dark scattering models that is characterised by pure

parameter space with respect to $\Lambda$CDM by two parameters, $w$ and $A$,
which define the dark energy equation of state and the strength of the coupling
between dark energy and dark matter, respectively. In order to test
non-standard cosmologies with Stage-IV galaxy clustering surveys, it is crucial
to model mildly nonlinear scales and perform precision vs accuracy tests. We

with the addition of the bispectrum quadrupole. Finally, we study degeneracies

discuss the corresponding projection effects, as well as degeneracies with

consider matching of \emph{CGPs} under simulation semantics which can be
conducted in quadratic time. In emerging applications, one would like to reduce
more this matching time, and the static analysis of patterns may allow ensuring
part of this reduction. We study the containment problem of \emph{CGPs} that
aims to check whether the matches of some pattern $P_1$, over any data graph,
are contained in those of another pattern $P_2$ (written $P_1\sqsubseteq P_2$).
The optimization process consists to extract matches of $P_1$ only from those
of $P_2$ without querying the (possibly large) data graph. We show that the
traditional semantics of containment is decidable in quadratic time, but it
fails to meet the optimization goal in the presence of negation and predicates.
To overcome this limit, we propose a new semantics of containment, called
\emph{strong containment}, that is more suitable for \emph{CGPs} and allows to
reduce their matching time. We show that \emph{strong containment} can be
decided in cubic time by providing such an algorithm. We are planing to use

high-frequency behaviour of nodal lines for random eigenfunctions with no
temporal dependence. In the short memory case, we show that all chaoses
contribute in the limit, no cancellation occurs and a Central Limit Theorem can
be established by Fourth-Moment Theorems and a Breuer-Major argument.

image regularization. PnP yields state-of-the-art results, but its theoretical
aspects are not well understood. This work considers the question: Similar to
classical compressed sensing (CS), can we theoretically recover the
ground-truth via PnP under suitable conditions on the denoiser and the sensing
matrix? One hurdle is that since PnP is an algorithmic framework, its solution
need not be the minimizer of some objective function. It was recently shown
that a convex regularizer $\Phi$ can be associated with a class of linear
denoisers such that PnP amounts to solving a convex problem involving $\Phi$.
Motivated by this, we consider the PnP analog of CS: minimize $\Phi(x)$ s.t.
$Ax=A\xi$, where $A$ is a $m\times n$ random sensing matrix, $\Phi$ is the
regularizer associated with a linear denoiser $W$, and $\xi$ is the
ground-truth. We prove that if $A$ is Gaussian and $\xi$ is in the range of
$W$, then the minimizer is almost surely $\xi$ if $rank(W)\leq m$, and almost
never if $rank(W)> m$. Thus, the range of the PnP denoiser acts as a signal
prior, and its dimension marks a sharp transition from failure to success of
exact recovery. We extend the result to subgaussian sensing matrices, except
that exact recovery holds only with high probability. For noisy measurements $b
= A \xi + \eta$, we consider a robust formulation: minimize $\Phi(x)$ s.t.
$\|Ax-b\|\leq\delta$. We prove that for an optimal solution $x^*$, with high
probability the distortion $\|x^*-\xi\|$ is bounded by $\|\eta\|$ and $\delta$
if the number of measurements is large enough. In particular, we can derive the
sample complexity of CS as a function of distortion error and success rate. We
discuss the extension of these results to random Fourier measurements, perform
numerical experiments, and discuss research directions stemming from this work.

The Landweber method is used to generate initial guesses for the exact
contrast, and the IRGNM is employed to make further improvements to the
estimated contrast. Our deep neural network (called the learned projector in
this paper) mainly focuses on learning the a priori information of the shape of
the unknown contrast by using a normalization technique in the training process
and is trained to act like a projector which is expected to make the estimated
contrast obtained by the Landweber method or the IRGNM closer to the exact
contrast. It is believed that the application of the normalization technique
can release the burden of training the deep neural network and lead to good
performance of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the learned projector is
expected to provide good initial guesses for IRGNM and be helpful for
accelerating the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that
our inversion algorithm has a satisfactory reconstruction capacity and good

popular tool for conducting cost-benefit analysis; the MVPF relies on the ratio
of willingness-to-pay for a policy divided by its net fiscal cost. The MVPF
gives policymakers important information about the equity-efficiency trade-off
that is not necessarily conveyed by absolute welfare measures. However, I show
in this paper that the usefulness of MVPF for comparative welfare analysis is
limited, because it suffers from several empirically important economic
paradoxes and statistical irregularities. There are also several practical
issues in using the MVPF to aggregate welfare across policies or across
population subgroups. To address these problems, I develop a new axiomatic
framework to construct a measure that quantifies the equity-efficiency
trade-off in a better way. I do so without compromising on the core features of
the MVPF: its unit-free property, and the main preference orderings underlying
it. My axiomatic framework delivers a unique (econo)metric that I call the
Relative Policy Value (RPV), which can be weighted to conduct both comparative
and absolute welfare analyses (or a hybrid combination thereof) and to
intuitively aggregate welfare (without encountering the issues in MVPF-based
aggregation). I also propose computationally convenient methods to make
uniformly valid statistical inferences on welfare measures. After reanalyzing
several government policies using my new econometric methods, I conclude that
there is substantial economic and statistical uncertainty about welfare of some
policies that were previously reported to have very high or even ""precisely

results of deregulated expressions of major K+ channels in glia, Kir4.1, in
models of disease, as well as their altered rectification when assembling
heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels have motivated us to attempt a detailed
model adding the weaker potassium K2P current, in addition to Kir4.1, and study
the stability of the resting state Vr. We ask whether with a deregulated Kir
conductivity the nominal resting state Vr remains stable, and the cell retains
a potassium electrode behavior with Vm following E_K. The minimal 2-dimensional
model near Vr showed that certain alterations of Kir4.1 current may result in
multistability of Vm if the model incorporates the typically observed K+
currents: Kir, K2P, and non-specific potassium leak. More specifically, a
decrease or loss of outward Kir4.1 conductance introduces instability of Vr,
near E_K. That happens through a fold bifurcation giving birth to a much more
depolarized second, stable resting state Vdr>-10 mV. Realistic timeseries were
used to perturb the membrane model, from recordings at the glial membrane
during electrographic seizures. Simulations of the perturbed system by constant
current through GJCs and transient seizure-like discharges as local field
potentials led to depolarization of the astrocyte and switching of Vm between
the two stable states, in a down-state / up-state manner. If the prolonged
depolarizations near Vdr prove experimentally plausible, such catastrophic
instability would impact all aspects of the glial function, from metabolic
support to membrane transport and practically all neuromodulatory roles
assigned to glia.

Otherwise, they park there and the car parked in that spot is bumped to the
next unoccupied spot on the street. If all cars can park under this parking
procedure, we say the list of preferences of the $n$ cars is an MVP parking
function of length $n$. We show that the set of (classical) parking functions
is exactly the set of MVP parking functions although the parking outcome (order
in which the cars park) is different under each parking process. Motivating the
question: Given a permutation describing the outcome of the MPV parking
process, what is the number of MVP parking functions resulting in that given
outcome? Our main result establishes a bound for this count which is tight
precisely when the permutation describing the parking outcome avoids the

closed formulas for the number of MVP parking functions with those outcomes. In
particular, we show that the number of MVP parking functions which park in
reverse order (that is the permutation describing the outcome is the longest
word in $\mathfrak{S}_n$, which does not avoid the pattern 321) is given by the
$n$th Motzkin number. We also give families of permutations describing the
parking outcome for which the cardinality of the set of cars parking in that

module that utilizes the structure of the involved constant-weight code. We
apply the encoding structure to (i) the unsourced random access setting, where
all users employ a common dictionary, and (ii) to the ""sourced"" random access

that standard network analysis on social media data can be unreliable in the

operations needed in order to prepare a quantum state. As typical measures
either involve minimization procedures or a computational cost exponential in
the number of qubits $N$, it is notoriously hard to characterize for many-body
states. In this work, we show that nonstabilizerness, as quantified by the
recently introduced Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies (SREs), can be computed
efficiently for matrix product states (MPSs). Specifically, given an MPS of
bond dimension $\chi$ and integer R\'enyi index $n>1$, we show that the SRE can
be expressed in terms of the norm of an MPS with bond dimension $\chi^{2n}$.
For translation-invariant states, this allows us to extract it from a single
tensor, the transfer matrix, while for generic MPSs this construction yields a
computational cost linear in $N$ and polynomial in $\chi$. We exploit this
observation to revisit the study of ground-state nonstabilizerness in the
quantum Ising chain, providing accurate numerical results up to large system
sizes. We analyze the SRE near criticality and investigate its dependence on
the local computational basis, showing that it is in general not maximal at the
critical point.

of frequencies in an aggregated dataset. We study how well offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can accommodate data with a mixture of

different rates for different discretizations, leading to a number of learning
challenges for off-the-shelf offline RL. We present a simple yet effective
solution that enforces consistency in the rate of $Q$-value updates to
stabilize learning. By scaling the value of $N$ in $N$-step returns with the
discretization size, we effectively balance $Q$-value propagation, leading to
more stable convergence. On three simulated robotic control problems, we

and $S_8$ tensions. Inspired from string theory, our model includes two fields:
an axion, which plays a role similar to the scalar field in early dark energy
models, and a dilaton. This theory differs from other axio-dilaton models aimed
at the Hubble tension in that there is necessarily kinetic mixing between the
two fields which allows for efficient energy transfer from the axion into the
dilaton which has $w\approx1$. As a direct consequence of these dynamics, we
find the model does not need to resort to a fine-tuned potential to solve the
Hubble tension and naturally accommodates a standard axion potential.
Furthermore, the axion will necessarily makeup a small (fuzzy) fraction of
$\Omega_{\rm cdm}$ once it begins to oscillate at the bottom of its potential
and will suppress the growth of perturbations on scales sensitive to $S_8$.
Interestingly, the scale of the potential for the dilaton has to be small,
$\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10~{\rm meV})^4$, suggesting the possibility for a
connection to dark energy. Implementing the dynamics for the background and
perturbations in a modified Boltzmann code we calculate the CMB and matter

Recently, the typical fidelity $F_{\rm typ}$ was found in quantum critical
phases to decay exponentially with system size $L$ as $F \sim \exp(-c L^{z
\eta})$\cite{Kettemann2016} as found in an analytical derivation due to
critical correlations. For the critical AA model $\eta = 1/2$ is the power of
multifractal intensity correlations, and $z$ the dynamical exponent due to the
fractal structure of the density of states which is numerically found to be $z
\gg 1$. Surprisingly, however, we find for a weak single site impurity that the
fidelity decays with a power law, in the critical phase. Even though it is
found to be smaller and decays faster than in the metallic phase, it does not
decay exponentially as predicted. We find an exponential AOC however in the
insulator phase for which we give a statistical explanation, a mechanism which
is profoundly different from the AOC in metals, where it is the coupling to a
continuum of states which yields there the power law suppression of the
fidelity. By reexamination of the analytical derivation we identify
nonperturbative corrections due to the impurity potential and multipoint
correlations among wave functions as possible causes for the absence of the
exponential AOC in the critical phase. For an extended impurity, however, we
find indications of an exponential AOC at the quantum critical point of the AA

be observed as Type IIn events. The leading hypothesis of the cause of these
outbursts is the response of the envelope of the red supergiant (RSG)
progenitor to energy deposition in the months to years prior to collapse. Early
theoretical studies of this phenomena were limited to 1D, leaving the 3D
convective RSG structure unaddressed. Using FLASH's hydrodynamic capabilities,
we explore the 3D outcomes by constructing convective RSG envelope models and
depositing energies less than the envelope binding energies on timescales
shorter than the envelope dynamical time deep within them. We confirm the 1D
prediction of an outward moving acoustic pulse steepening into a shock,
unbinding the outermost parts of the envelope. However, we find that the
initial 2-4 km/s convective motions seed the intrinsic convective instability
associated with the high entropy material deep in the envelope, enabling gas
from deep within the envelope to escape, increasing the amount of ejected mass
compared to an initially ""quiescent"" envelope. The 3D models reveal a rich
density structure, with column densities varying by 10x along different lines
of sight. Our work highlights that the 3D convective nature of RSG envelopes
impacts our ability to reliably predict the outburst dynamics, the amount, and

a galaxy's energy budget is crucial for studying the co-evolution of AGN and
their host galaxies. Brightness temperature ($T_b$) measurements from
high-resolution radio observations at GHz frequencies are widely used to
identify AGN. Here we investigate using new sub-arcsecond imaging at 144 MHz
with the International LOFAR Telescope to identify AGN using $T_b$ in the
Lockman Hole field. We use ancillary data to validate the 940 AGN
identifications, finding 83 percent of sources have AGN classifications from
SED fitting and/or photometric identifications, yielding 160 new AGN
identifications. Considering the multi-wavelength classifications, brightness
temperature criteria select over half of radio-excess sources, 32 percent of
sources classified as radio-quiet AGN, and 20 percent of sources classified as
star-forming galaxies. Infrared colour-colour plots and comparison with what we
would expect to detect based on peak brightness in 6 arcsec LOFAR maps, imply
that the star-forming galaxies and sources at low flux densities have a mixture
of star-formation and AGN activity. We separate the radio emission from
star-formation and AGN in unresolved, $T_b$-identified AGN with no significant
radio excess and find the AGN comprises $0.49\pm 0.16$ of the radio luminosity.
Overall the non-radio excess AGN show evidence for having a variety of
different radio emission mechanisms, which can provide different pathways for
AGN and galaxy co-evolution. This validation of AGN identification using
brightness temperature at low frequencies opens the possibility for securely
selecting AGN samples where ancillary data is inadequate.

targets in our initial sample. The first detection, around TOI 560b, was
announced in a previous paper. We now announce three additional detections
around TOI 1430.01, 2076b, and TOI 1683.01. All four planets show an average
in-transit excess absorption of 0.7--1.0%. However, the outflows differ in
their kinematic properties. TOI 1430b exhibits pre-ingress absorption, while
TOI 2076b's outflow is exceptionally optically thick and shows significant
post-egress absorption. For all four planets, the width of the measured helium
absorption signal is consistent with expectations for a photoevaporative
outflow (10--30 km/s, 5000--10,000 K). Unless broadening mechanisms other than
thermal velocity and the bulk outflow velocity are significant, our
observations disfavor core-powered mass loss models, which predict much slower
(1--3 km/s) outflows. We utilize both an isothermal Parker wind model and an
order-of-magnitude method to estimate the mass loss timescale, and obtain
$\sim$ a few hundred Myr for each planet. We conclude that many, if not all, of
these planets will lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes and become super Earths.
Our results demonstrate that most mini Neptunes orbiting sun-like stars have
primordial atmospheres, and that photoevaporation is an efficient mechanism for
stripping these atmospheres and transforming these planets into super Earths.

velocity dispersions are of order 30 km/s, similar to that of old stellar
populations in the LMC disk. Similar to the case for Milky Way disk clusters,
the velocity anisotropy is such that the dispersion is smallest in the
azimuthal direction; however, alternative anisotropies cannot be ruled out due
to distance uncertainties. The data are consistent with a single

except F150W, where we find a marginally steeper slope of $\beta=0.53\pm0.15$.
The steep UV slope is mainly driven by the smallest and faintest galaxies. If
confirmed by larger samples, it implies that the UV size-luminosity relation
breaks toward the faint end as suggested by lensing studies.

asynchronous rise across the Universe. The latter might have left imprints
visible in present day observations. Several numerical simulation-based studies
show correlations between reionization time and overdensities and object masses
today. To remove the mass from the study, as it may not be the sole important
parameter, this paper focuses solely on the properties of paired halos within
the same mass range as the Milky Way. For this purpose, it uses CoDaII, a
fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamics reionization simulation of the local
Universe. This simulation holds a halo pair representing the Local Group, in
addition to other pairs, sharing similar mass, mass ratio, distance separation
and isolation criteria but in other environments, alongside isolated halos
within the same mass range. Investigations of the paired halo reionization
histories reveal a wide diversity although always inside-out given our
reionization model. Within this model, halos in a close pair tend to be
reionized at the same time but being in a pair does not bring to an earlier
time their mean reionization. The only significant trend is found between the
total energy at z = 0 of the pairs and their mean reionization time: pairs with
the smallest total energy (bound) are reionized up to 50 Myr earlier than
others (unbound). Above all, this study reveals the variety of reionization
histories undergone by halo pairs similar to the Local Group, that of the Local
Group being far from an average one. In our model, its reionization time is
~625 Myr against 660+/-4 Myr (z~8.25 against 7.87+/-0.02) on average.

covered to an unprecedented sensitivity. This range encodes the reflection
features arising from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Especially, the reflection
of the primary radiation off the accretion disk carries the features of the
manifestation of General Relativity described by the Kerr metric due to
rotating supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show the results of the broadband
analyses of Mrk 876. The spectra exhibit the signature of a Compton hump at
energies above 10 keV and a broadened and skewed excess at energies ~6 keV. We
establish this spectral excess to be statistically significant at 99.71%
(~3sigma) that is the post-trail probability through Monte Carlo simulations.
Based on the spectral fit results and the significance of spectral features the
relativistic reflection model is favored over the distant reflection scenario.
The excess at ~6 keV has a complex shape that we try to recover along with the
Compton hump through a self-consistent X-ray reflection model. This allows
inferring an upper limit to the black hole spin of a<0.85, while the
inclination angle of the accretion disk results in i=32.84 (+12.22\-8.99)
degrees, which is in agreement within the errors with a previous independent
measurement (i=15.4 (+12.1/-6.8) degrees). While most spin measurements are
biased toward high spin values, the black hole mass of Mrk~876 (2.4x10^8 Msun <
M < 1.3x10^9 Msun) lies in a range where moderately spinning SMBHs are
expected. Moreover, the analyses of twelve Chandra observations reveal for the
first time X-ray variability of Mrk876 with an amplitude of 40%.

Focusing on the $U(1)$ spin liquid ansatze, we find that only two of them are
physical when restricted to this model. We present an analytical solution to
the parton mean field theory for each of these two $U(1)$ spin liquids. It is
revealed that one of them has gapless, while the other one has gapped, spinon

degree of breathing anisotropy, and they can be differentiated by the
low-temperature heat capacity contribution from the quadratically-dispersing
gapless spinons. We further show that the latter is unaffected by fluctuations
of the $U(1)$ gauge field within the random phase approximation. Finally, we
demonstrate that a small Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction lifts the degeneracy
between the two $U(1)$ spin liquids, and it eventually causes the lattice to
decouple into independent tetrahedra at strong coupling. While current model
parameters for Ba$_3$Yb$_2$Zn$_5$O$_{11}$ place it indeed in the decoupled

between a set of high-resolution NR simulations and the state of the art
effective one body (EOB) model ${\tt TEOBResumS}$ with various tidal potentials

$f$-mode resonances can improve the agreement between EOB and NR, but there is
no clear evidence that the tidal enhancement after contact is due to a resonant
mechanism. Tidal models with $f$-mode resonances do not consistently reproduce,
at the same time, the NR waveforms and the energetics within the errors, and
their performances is comparable to resummed tidal models without resonances.
For highly eccentric mergers, we show for the first time that our EOB model

aiming to measure the inflationary B-mode signal is the removal of polarized
foregrounds. The thermal dust foreground is often modeled as a single modified
blackbody, however overly simplistic foreground models can bias measurements of
the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. As CMB polarization experiments become
increasingly sensitive, thermal dust emission models must account for greater
complexity in the dust foreground while making minimal assumptions about the
underlying distribution of dust properties within a beam. We use Planck dust
temperature data to estimate the typical variation in dust properties along the
line of sight and examine the impact of these variations on the bias in r if a
single modified blackbody model is assumed. We then assess the ability of the
moment method to capture the effects of spatial averaging and to reduce bias in
the tensor-to-scalar ratio for different possible toy models of dust emission.
We find that the expected bias due to temperature variations along the line of
sight is significant compared to the target sensitivities of future CMB
experiments, and that the use of the moment method could reduce bias as well as
shed light into the distribution of dust physical parameters.

non were able to consistently reproduce the observed properties of Ca-rich SNe,
nor their rates and host-galaxy distributions. Here we show that the
disruptions of low-mass carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) by hybrid
Helium-CO (HeCO) WDs during their merger could explain the origin and
properties of such SNe. We make use of detailed multi-dimensional
hydrodynamical-thermonuclear (FLASH) simulations models of HeCO-CO WD-WD
mergers to characterize such explosions. We find that the accretion of CO
material onto a HeCO-WD heats its He-shell and eventually leads to its ""weak""
detonation and ejection and the production of a sub-energetic $\sim10^{49}$erg
Ca-rich SN, while leaving the CO core of the HeCO-WD intact as a hot remnant
white dwarf, possibly giving rise to X-ray emission as it cools down. We model
the detailed light-curve and spectra of such explosions to find an excellent
agreement with observations of Ia/c Ca-rich SNe. In these models most of the He
is burned, producing Ia/c Ca-rich SNe but higher He-enrichment levels might
potentially also explain the Ib Ca-rich SNe. We thereby provide a viable,
consistent model for the origins of Ca-rich. These findings can shed new light
on the role of Ca-rich in the chemical evolution of galaxies and the
intra-cluster medium, and their contribution to the observed 511 kev signal in
the Galaxy originating from positrons produced from ${}^{44}\textrm{Ti}$ decay.
Finally, the origins of such SNe points to the key-role of HeCO WDs as SN
progenitors, and their potential role as progenitors of other thermonuclear SNe
including normal type Ia SNe.

JWST/NIRISS, combined with lensing magnification, enable us to resolve this

heterogenous machines in the presence of non-uniform job and machine
communication delays. We are given as input $n$ unit size precedence-ordered
jobs and $m$ related machines such that machine $i$ can execute up to $m_i$
jobs at a time. Each machine $i$ has an in-delay $\rho^{\mathrm{in}}_i$ and
out-delay $\rho^{\mathrm{out}}_i$. Likewise, each job $v$ has an in-delay
$\rho^{\mathrm{in}}_v$ and out-delay $\rho^{\mathrm{out}}_v$. In a schedule,
job $v$ may be executed on machine $i$ at time $t$ if each predecessor $u$ of
$v$ is completed on $i$ before time $t$ or on any machine $j$ before time $t -
(\rho^{\mathrm{in}}_i + \rho^{\mathrm{out}}_j + \rho^{\mathrm{out}}_u +
\rho^{\mathrm{in}}_v)$. The goal is to construct a schedule that minimizes
makespan.
  We consider schedules that allow duplication of jobs as well as schedules
which do not. When duplication is allowed, we provide an asymptotic
$\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation algorithms both when duplication is allowed
and when it is not. We also obtain a true $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation
for symmetric machine and job delays. These are the first polylogarithmic
approximation algorithms for scheduling with non-uniform communication delays.
  We also consider a more general model, where the delay can be an arbitrary
function of the job and the machine executing it: job $v$ can be executed on
machine $i$ at time $t$ if all of $v$'s predecessors are executed on $i$ by
time $t-1$ or on any machine by time $t - \rho_{v,i}$. We present an
approximation-preserving reduction from the Unique Machines
Precedence-constrained Scheduling (UMPS) problem, first defined in [DKRSTZ22],
to this job-machine delay model. The reduction entails logarithmic hardness for
this delay setting, as well as polynomial hardness if the conjectured hardness
of UMPS holds.

understandings of the many sources of decoherence. Within these devices,
two-level systems arise due to defects, interfaces, and grain boundaries, and
are thought to be a major source of qubit decoherence at millikelvin

superconducting qubits. Consequently, a significant effort is required to
develop and qualify processes that mitigate defects in Nb films. As the
fabrication of complete superconducting qubits and their characterization at
millikelvin temperatures is a time and resource intensive process, it is
desirable to have measurement tools that can rapidly characterize the
properties of films and evaluate different treatments. Here we show that
measurements of the variation of the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$

observing private signals about an unknown binary event, report their posterior
beliefs about the event to a principal, who then aggregates the reports into a
single prediction for the event. The signals of the experts and the outcome of
the event follow a joint distribution that is unknown to the principal, but the
principal has access to i.i.d. ""samples"" from the distribution, where each
sample is a tuple of the experts' reports (not signals) and the realization of
the event. Using these samples, the principal aims to find an
$\varepsilon$-approximately optimal aggregator, where optimality is measured in
terms of the expected squared distance between the aggregated prediction and
the realization of the event. We show that the sample complexity of this
problem is at least $\tilde \Omega(m^{n-2} / \varepsilon)$ for arbitrary
discrete distributions, where $m$ is the size of each expert's signal space.
This sample complexity grows exponentially in the number of experts $n$. But,
if the experts' signals are independent conditioned on the realization of the
event, then the sample complexity is significantly reduced, to $\tilde O(1 /
\varepsilon^2)$, which does not depend on $n$. Our results can be generalized
to non-binary events. The proof of our results uses a reduction from the
distribution learning problem and reveals the fact that forecast aggregation is
almost as difficult as distribution learning.

from the very small energy carried by a single photon at these wavelengths.
Usually to detect photons the photoelectric effect is used. It converts a
photon to a single electron making it very difficult to detect because of the
readout noise of the electronics. To overcome this there are two strategies,
either to amplify the signal to make it larger than the readout noise (used in
the so called gain or amplified detectors), or to lower the readout noise in a
standard image sensor. For a long time, only amplified detectors were able to
do some photon counting. Since the first photon counting systems in the
visible, developed by Boksenberg and his collaborators in 1972, many groups
around the world improved photon counting techniques. In the 2000's in the
visible, EMCCDs (electron multiplying charge coupled devices) allowed to
replace the classical image intensifier photon counting systems by solid state
devices and improved a lot the QE. But EMCCDs suffer from several issues, and
the most important of them is the excess noise factor which prevents to know
the exact incoming number of photons in the case of multiple photons per pixel.
In the infrared there was no equivalent to EMCCDs up to the development of
e-APD sensors and cameras made with HgCdTe material (electron initiated
avalanche photo diode). With an excess noise factor near 1 at low temperatures,
photon counting is possible with these devices but only in the infrared. We
will show that having excess noise factor prevents from being able to do
multiple photon counting (quanta imaging) and the only solution is to lower the
readout noise.

neutron mean lifetime, and update our evaluation for the nuclear rates $d+d

the independent constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) yields
tight limits on new physics that perturbs $N_\nu$ and $\eta$ prior to cosmic

resulting in $N_\nu < 3.180$ at $2\sigma$. We apply these limits to a wide
variety of new physics scenarios including right-handed neutrinos, dark
radiation, and a stochastic gravitational wave background. We also search for
limits on potential {\em changes} in $N_\nu$ and/or the baryon-to-photon ratio
$\eta$ between the two epochs. The present data place strong constraints on the
allowed changes in $N_\nu$ between BBN and CMB decoupling; for example, we find
$-0.708 < N_\nu^{\rm CMB}-N_\nu^{\rm BBN} < 0.328$ in the case where $\eta$ and
the primordial helium mass fraction $Y_p$ are unchanged between the two epochs;
we also give limits on the allowed variations in $\eta$ or in $(\eta,N_\nu)$
jointly. Looking to the future, we forecast the tightened precision for $N_\nu$
arising from both CMB Stage 4 measurements as well as improvements in
astronomical \he4 measurements. We find that CMB-S4 combined with present BBN
and light element observation precision can give $\sigma(N_\nu) \simeq 0.03$.
Such future precision would reveal the expected effect of neutrino heating

feed-forward of classical information, readily achievable in many experimental

large height variation, such as horizontally oriented cylinders, a wedge
(Jurestovsky, Usher, Astley, 2021, J. Exp. Biol.), and uneven terrain (Fu & Li,
2020, Roy. Soc. Open Sci.; Fu, Astley, Li, 2022 Bioinspiration & Biomimetics).
Here, to understand how vertical bending generates propulsion, we developed a
dynamic simulation of a snake traversing a wedge (height = 0.05 body length,
slope = 27 degrees) and a half cylindrical obstacle (height = 0.1 body length).
By propagating down the body an internal torque profile with a maximum around
the obstacle, the simulated snake moved forward as observed in the animal.
Remarkably, even when frictional drag is low (snake-terrain kinetic friction
coefficient of 0.20), the body must push against the wedge with a pressure 5
times that from body weight to generate sufficient forward propulsion to move
forward. This indicated that snakes are highly capable of bending vertically to
push against the environment to generate propulsion. Testing different
controllers revealed that contact force feedback further helps generate and
maintain propulsion effectively under unknown terrain perturbations.

energy transfer in a boundary layer undergoing bypass transition, with the aid
of the Karman-Howarth-Monin-Hill (KHMH) equation. A local binary indicator
function is used to detect the interface and employed subsequently to define
two-point intermittencies. These are used to decompose the standard-averaged
interscale and interspace energy fluxes into conditionally-averaged components.
We find that the inverse cascade in the streamwise direction reported in an
earlier work arises due to events across the downstream or upstream interfaces
(head or tail respectively) of a turbulent spot. However, the three-dimensional
energy flux maps reveal significant differences between these two regions: in
the downstream interface, inverse cascade is stronger and dominant over a
larger range of streamwise and spanwise separations. We explain this finding by
considering a propagating spot of simplified shape as it crosses a fixed
streamwise location. We derive also the conditionally-averaged KHMH equation,
thus generalising similar equations for single-point statistics to two-point
statistics. We compare the three-dimensional maps of the conditionally-averaged
production and total energy flux within turbulent spots against the maps of
standard-averaged quantities within the fully turbulent region. The results
indicate remarkable dynamical similarities between turbulent spots and the
fully turbulent region for two-point statistics. This has been known only for
single-point quantities, and we show here that the similarity extends to
two-point quantities as well.

superdiffusive exponent is almost invariant to the inhomogeneity degree. Both
the time-asymptotic regime and the finite-size scaling unveil an emergent

have emerged as a reliable alternative to predict the explosion behavior with
good accuracy and reduced labor and capital. In this work, numerical
simulations of biomass dust explosions are conducted with the open-source CFD
code OpenFOAM. The multi-phase (gas-solid) flow is treated in an
Eulerian-Lagrangian framework, using a two-way coupling regime and considering
the reactions of biomass conversion (moisture evaporation, devolatilization,
and char oxidation), the combustion of volatile gases, and convective and
radiative heat transfer. The model is validated with pressure-time and
concentration-dependent experimental measurements of two biomass samples.
Results suggest that the characteristics of the cold-flow (\i.e. turbulence
levels, actual dust concentration, spatial distribution of the dust cloud, and
turbophoresis effect) govern the course of the explosion process, and depend
strongly on particle size, dust concentration, and ignition delay time effects.
These findings may be relevant in the design of better dust explosion testing
devices and to the reexamination of the guidelines for the operation of the
experiment. Finally, a thorough discussion on the explosion pressures, degree
of biomass conversion, flame temperature, flame propagation patterns, and the
dust agglomeration effect is presented.

10Myr. The evolution is modelled for five different constant grain sizes, and
one model where the grain size changes with time according to a grain growth
model appropriate for the disk midplane. Local grain growth, with conservation
of total grain mass and the assumption of spherical grains, acts to reduced the
total grain-surface area that is available for ice-phase reactions. This
reduces these reactions efficiency compared to a chemical scenario with a
conventional grain-size choice of 0.1$\mu$m. The modelled chemical evolution

the inner disk, grain growth leads CO gas to overtake CO$_{2}$ ice as dominant
carrier, and in the outer disk, CH$_{4}$ ice to become the dominant carrier.
Overall, a constant grain size adopted from a grain evolution model leads to
almost identical chemical evolution, when compared with chemical evolution with
evolving grain sizes. A constant grain size choice, albeit larger than
0.1$\mu$m, may therefore be an appropriate simplification when approximating
the impact of grain growth on chemical evolution.

the work is on axisymmetric single contacts under arbitrary unidirectional

fact, even though a service can withstand a steady load of, e.g., 70% CPU
utilization, the autoscaler is triggered at, e.g., 30-40% (thus the service
uses twice as many nodes as it would be needed). We propose an alternative: a
worker-level method handling heavy load without increasing the number of nodes.
  FaaS executions are not interactive, compared to, e.g., text editors:
end-users do not benefit from the CPU allocated to processes often, yet for
short periods. Inspired by scheduling methods for High Performance Computing,
we take a radical step of replacing the classic OS preemption by (1) queuing

requests, as the average stretch is decreased by a factor of 18. This leads us
to show that we can provide better response-time statistics with 3 machines

heroic assumptions on the data. In this paper, we introduce unsupervised
learning under Latent Label Shift (LLS), where we have access to unlabeled data
from multiple domains such that the label marginals $p_d(y)$ can shift across
domains but the class conditionals $p(\mathbf{x}|y)$ do not. This work
instantiates a new principle for identifying classes: elements that shift
together group together. For finite input spaces, we establish an isomorphism
between LLS and topic modeling: inputs correspond to words, domains to
documents, and labels to topics. Addressing continuous data, we prove that when
each label's support contains a separable region, analogous to an anchor word,
oracle access to $p(d|\mathbf{x})$ suffices to identify $p_d(y)$ and
$p_d(y|\mathbf{x})$ up to permutation. Thus motivated, we introduce a practical
algorithm that leverages domain-discriminative models as follows: (i) push
examples through domain discriminator $p(d|\mathbf{x})$; (ii) discretize the
data by clustering examples in $p(d|\mathbf{x})$ space; (iii) perform
non-negative matrix factorization on the discrete data; (iv) combine the
recovered $p(y|d)$ with the discriminator outputs $p(d|\mathbf{x})$ to compute
$p_d(y|x) \; \forall d$. With semi-synthetic experiments, we show that our
algorithm can leverage domain information to improve upon competitive
unsupervised classification methods. We reveal a failure mode of standard
unsupervised classification methods when feature-space similarity does not
indicate true groupings, and show empirically that our method better handles
this case. Our results establish a deep connection between distribution shift
and topic modeling, opening promising lines for future work.

in the dynamics of open quantum systems. These measures are based on the
distinguishability of quantum states which is quantified, on the one hand, by
the trace distance or, more generally, by the trace norm of the Helstrom
matrix, and, on the other hand, by entropic quantifiers: the Jensen-Shannon
divergence, the Holevo or the quantum skew divergence. We explicitly construct
a qubit dynamics for which the trace norm based non-Markovianity measure is
nonzero, while all the entropic measures turn out to be zero. This leads to the
surprising conclusion that the non-Markovianity measure which employs the trace
norm of the Helstrom matrix is strictly stronger than all entropic
non-Markovianity measures.

therapy (IMRT) treatment planning problem. In superiorization, linear voxel
dose inequality constraints are the fundamental modeling tool within which a
feasibility-seeking projection algorithm will seek a feasible point. This
algorithm is then perturbed with gradient descent steps to reduce a nonlinear
objective function. Within the open-source inverse planning toolkit matRad, we
implement a prototypical algorithmic framework for superiorization using the
well-established Agmon, Motzkin, and Schoenberg (AMS) feasibility-seeking
projection algorithm and common nonlinear dose optimization objective
functions. Based on this prototype, we apply superiorization to
intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning and compare its
performance with feasibility-seeking and nonlinear constrained optimization.
For these comparisons, we use the TG119 water phantom and a head-and-neck
patient of the CORT dataset. Bare feasibility-seeking with AMS confirms
previous studies, showing it can find solutions that are nearly equivalent to
those found by the established piece-wise least-squares optimization approach.
The superiorization prototype solved the linearly constrained planning problem
with similar performance to that of a general-purpose nonlinear constrained
optimizer while showing smooth convergence in both constraint proximity and
objective function reduction. Superiorization is a useful alternative to
constrained optimization in radiotherapy inverse treatment planning. Future
extensions with other approaches to feasibility-seeking, e.g., with dose-volume

performing vector-matrix multiplication, inverting matrices, and solving
integral and differential equations, via electromagnetic wave interaction and

two sub-systems: a set of reconfigurable couplers with a proper feedback system

computes the magnitude and phase of the dipole polarization induced in the
scatterers when illuminated with a given incident wave (matrix inversion). The
second sub-system computes the magnitude and phase of the scattered fields at

theoretically evaluate its performance by comparing the simulation results of
this device with full-wave numerical simulations and numerically evaluated
matrix inversion. We also highlight that since the first section is

distributions of the scatterer and different incident excitations without
changing the inverse-designed section. Our proposed device may provide a

threats against practical audio signal classification systems, including speech

studies have mainly focused on ensuring the effectiveness of attacking an audio
signal classifier via creating a small noise-like perturbation on the original
signal. It is still unclear if an attacker is able to create audio signal
perturbations that can be well perceived by human beings in addition to its
attack effectiveness. This is particularly important for music signals as they
are carefully crafted with human-enjoyable audio characteristics.
  In this work, we formulate the adversarial attack against music signals as a
new perception-aware attack framework, which integrates human study into
adversarial attack design. Specifically, we conduct a human study to quantify
the human perception with respect to a change of a music signal. We invite
human participants to rate their perceived deviation based on pairs of original
and perturbed music signals, and reverse-engineer the human perception process
by regression analysis to predict the human-perceived deviation given a
perturbed signal. The perception-aware attack is then formulated as an
optimization problem that finds an optimal perturbation signal to minimize the
prediction of perceived deviation from the regressed human perception model. We
use the perception-aware framework to design a realistic adversarial music
attack against YouTube's copyright detector. Experiments show that the
perception-aware attack produces adversarial music with significantly better
perceptual quality than prior work.

years with great detail in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations taking into
account all the channels under which dust evolves in the interstellar medium.
We present a systematic analysis of the observed spectral energy distribution
of a large sample of galaxies in the local universe in order to derive not only
the total dust masses but also the relative mass fraction between small and
large dust grains (DS/DL). Simulations reproduce fairly well the observations
except for the high stellar mass regime where dust masses tend to be
overestimated. We find that ~45% of galaxies exhibit DS/DL consistent with the
expectations of simulations, while there is a sub-sample of massive galaxies
presenting high DS/DL (log(DS/DL)~-0.5), and deviating from the prediction in
simulations. For these galaxies, which also have high molecular gas mass
fractions and metallicities, coagulation is not an important mechanism
affecting the dust evolution. Including diffusion, transporting large grains
from dense regions to a more diffuse medium where they can be easily shattered,
would explain the observed high DS/DL values in these galaxies. With this study
we reinforce the use of the small-to-large grain mass ratio to study the
relative importance of the different mechanisms in the dust life cycle.
Multi-phase hydrodynamical simulations with detailed feedback prescriptions and
more realistic subgrid models for the dense phase could help to reproduce the
evolution of the dust grain size distribution traced by observations.

learned image priors specified using convolutional neural nets (CNNs). For
example, well-known frameworks for systematically designing DMBAs include
plug-and-play priors (PnP), deep unfolding (DU), and deep equilibrium models
(DEQ). While the empirical performance and theoretical properties of DMBAs have
been widely investigated, the existing work in the area has primarily focused
on their performance when the desired image prior is known exactly. This work
addresses the gap in the prior work by providing new theoretical and numerical
insights into DMBAs under mismatched CNN priors. Mismatched priors arise
naturally when there is a distribution shift between training and testing data,
for example, due to test images being from a different distribution than images
used for training the CNN prior. They also arise when the CNN prior used for
inference is an approximation of some desired statistical estimator (MAP or
MMSE). Our theoretical analysis provides explicit error bounds on the solution
due to the mismatched CNN priors under a set of clearly specified assumptions.
Our numerical results compare the empirical performance of DMBAs under

20-300 GHz, surveying more than 50 percent of the sky to arcminute resolution
with unprecedented sensitivity. CMB-S4 seeks to make a dramatic leap in
sensitivity while observing across a broad range of largely unprotected
spectrum which is increasingly being utilized for terrestrial and satellite
transmissions. Fundamental aspects of CMB instrument technology leave them
vulnerable to radio frequency interference (RFI) across a wide range of
frequencies, including frequencies outside of their observing bands.
Ground-based CMB instruments achieve their extraordinary sensitivities by
deploying large focal planes of superconducting bolometers to extremely dry,
high-altitude sites, with large fractional bandwidths, wide fields of view, and
years of integration time. Suitable observing sites have historically offered
significant protection from RFI, both naturally through their extremely remote
locations as well as through restrictions on local emissions. Since the
coupling mechanisms are complex, safe levels or frequencies of emission that
would not interfere with CMB measurements cannot always be determined through
straightforward calculations. We discuss models of interference for various
types of RFI relevant to CMB-S4, mitigation strategies, and the potential
impacts on survey sensitivity.

potential to improve the sensitivity of optical receivers. Recent studies of
SiPMs in communication focus on the speed rather than the power consumption of
the receiver. The gain bandwidth product (GBP) of the amplifiers in these
post-SiPM readout circuits is significantly higher than the target data rate.
Additionally, the SiPM experiments for optical communication are performed
using an offline method which uses instruments including oscilloscopes and
personal computers to process chunks of the transmitted data. In this work, we
have developed an embedded real-time FPGA-based system to evaluate a
commercially available 1 mm-sq SiPM. The implemented real-time system achieves
data rates from 10 kbps to 1 Mbps with a BER below 1E-3 approaching the Poisson
limit. Results showed that reducing either the dark count rate or the data rate
leads to lower dark counts per bit time, hence less power penalty to maintain a
PE of 1E-3. The numerically simulated results indicated that to maintain the
Poisson limit, the minimum GBP of the amplifier in the post-SiPM readout
circuit is 120 MHz based on the proposed setup within the tested data rates.
This GBP limitation is determined by the noise floor of the read-out circuit.
The analysis of the minimum GBP and electrical power consumption of the
receiver in photon counting and BER enables the potential future adoption of
this receiver technology when high optical sensitivity is required, such as
visible light communications (VLC) for low energy and low data rate IoT
applications.

applying QOC. Here, we study QOC pulses for strontium clock interferometry and
demonstrate their advantage over basic square pulses (primitive pulses) and

transitions between vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and forward flight.
The global control formulation enables maneuvering throughout the flight
envelope, including uncoordinated flight with sideslip. Differential flatness
of the nonlinear tailsitter dynamics with a simplified aerodynamics model is
shown. Using the flatness transform, the proposed controller incorporates
tracking of the position reference along with its derivatives velocity,
acceleration and jerk, as well as the yaw reference and yaw rate. The inclusion
of jerk and yaw rate references through an angular velocity feedforward term
improves tracking of trajectories with fast-changing accelerations. The
controller does not depend on extensive aerodynamic modeling but instead uses
incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) to compute control updates based
on only a local input-output relation, resulting in robustness against
discrepancies in the simplified aerodynamics equations. Exact inversion of the
nonlinear input-output relation is achieved through the derived flatness
transform. The resulting control algorithm is extensively evaluated in flight
tests, where it demonstrates accurate trajectory tracking and challenging agile

nonlinear robot dynamics. We evaluate PI-ARS on a set of challenging
visual-locomotion tasks where a quadruped robot needs to walk on uneven
stepping stones, quincuncial piles, and moving platforms, as well as to
complete an indoor navigation task. Across all tasks, PI-ARS demonstrates
significantly better learning efficiency and performance compared to the ARS

achieving a 100% success rate on the real-world stepping stone environment,
dramatically improving prior results achieving 40% success.

absolute-zero temperature, known as quantum phase transitions, require an
exacting treatment of particle correlations. In this work, we present a general
quantum-computing approach to quantum phase transitions that exploits the
geometric structure of reduced density matrices. While typical approaches to
quantum phase transitions examine discontinuities in the order parameters, the
origin of phase transitions -- their order parameters and symmetry breaking --
can be understood geometrically in terms of the set of two-particle reduced
density matrices (2-RDMs). The convex set of 2-RDMs provides a comprehensive
map of the quantum system including its distinct phases as well as the
transitions connecting these phases. Because 2-RDMs can potentially be computed
on quantum computers at non-exponential cost, even when the quantum system is
strongly correlated, they are ideally suited for a quantum-computing approach
to quantum phase transitions. We compute the convex set of 2-RDMs for a
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model on IBM superconducting-qubit quantum
processors. Even though computations are limited to few-particle models due to
device noise, comparisons with a classically solvable 1000-particle model
reveal that the finite-particle quantum solutions capture the key features of
the phase transitions including the strong correlation and the symmetry
breaking.

pioneer work in point cloud, proposed masked point modeling (MPM) to pre-train
point transformer on large scale unanotated dataset. Despite its great
performance, we find the inherent difference between language and point cloud
tends to cause ambiguous tokenization for point cloud. For point cloud, there
doesn't exist a gold standard for point cloud tokenization. Point-BERT use a
discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) as tokenizer, but it might generate
different token ids for semantically-similar patches and generate the same
token ids for semantically-dissimilar patches. To tackle above problem, we
propose our McP-BERT, a pre-training framework with multi-choice tokens.
Specifically, we ease the previous single-choice constraint on patch token ids
in Point-BERT, and provide multi-choice token ids for each patch as
supervision. Moreover, we utilitze the high-level semantics learned by
transformer to further refine our supervision signals. Extensive experiments on
point cloud classification, few-shot classification and part segmentation tasks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, e.g., the pre-trained transformer
achieves 94.1% accuracy on ModelNet40, 84.28% accuracy on the hardest setting
of ScanObjectNN and new state-of-the-art performance on few-shot learning. We
also demonstrate that our method not only improves the performance of

accelerate the rate of materials design over conventional human-guided

specified functional properties to then be synthesized or isolated in the
laboratory. For crystal structure generation, a key bottleneck lies in
developing suitable atomic structure fingerprints or representations for the
machine learning model, analogous to the graph-based or SMILES representations
used in molecular generation. However, finding data-efficient representations
that are invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations, while
remaining invertible to the Cartesian atomic coordinates remains an ongoing
challenge. Here, we propose an alternative approach to this problem by taking
existing non-invertible representations with the desired invariances and
developing an algorithm to reconstruct the atomic coordinates through
gradient-based optimization using automatic differentiation. This can then be
coupled to a generative machine learning model which generates new materials
within the representation space, rather than in the data-inefficient Cartesian
space. In this work, we implement this end-to-end structure generation approach
using atom-centered symmetry functions as the representation and conditional
variational autoencoders as the generative model. We are able to successfully
generate novel and valid atomic structures of sub-nanometer Pt nanoparticles as
a proof of concept. Furthermore, this method can be readily extended to any
suitable structural representation, thereby providing a powerful, generalizable
framework towards structure-based generation.

sequence. The addition of rocky planetary material during engulfment will lead
to refractory abundance enhancements in the host star photosphere, but the
level of enrichment and its duration will depend on mixing processes that occur
within the stellar interior, such as convection, diffusion, and thermohaline
mixing. We examine engulfment signatures by modeling the evolution of
photospheric lithium abundances. Because lithium can be burned before or after
the engulfment event, it produces unique signatures that vary with time and
host star type. Using MESA stellar models, we quantify the strength and
duration of these signatures following the engulfment of a 1, 10, or 100
$M_{\oplus}$ planetary companion with bulk Earth composition, for
solar-metallicity host stars with masses ranging from 0.5$-$1.4 $M_{\odot}$. We
find that lithium is quickly depleted via burning in low-mass host stars
($\lesssim 0.7 \, M_\odot$) on a time scale of a few hundred Myrs, but
significant lithium enrichment signatures can last for Gyrs in G-type stars
($\sim \! 0.9 \, M_{\odot}$). For more massive stars (1.3$-$1.4 $M_{\odot}$),
engulfment can enhance internal mixing and diffusion processes, potentially
decreasing the surface lithium abundance. Our predicted signatures from
exoplanet engulfment are consistent with observed lithium-rich solar-type stars
and abundance enhancements in chemically inhomogeneous binary stars.

The results show that the star is a non-native member star for the Hyades, with
its radial velocity being smaller than the radial velocity of the Hyades
cluster, even exceeding the standard deviation of the radial velocity of the
cluster by a factor of 9. Furthermore, by analyzing and comparing the orbits of
this star and its host, it may have intruded into its host in the past 2~Myr.
If the star's current motion orbit remains unchanged, it may leave its host in
the next 2~Myr. This implies that the intruder star may be temporarily residing
in the cluster. This study presents the first observational evidence of a star
intrusion into a cluster, which suggests that more evidence may be found.

constructing the H{\alpha} Dopplergrams,we found that the plasma is first
moving upward,whereas during the second phase of the jet,the plasma is flowing
back.Working with time slice diagrams,we investigated the propagation-projected
speed of the fan and its bright base.The fan-shaped jet developed within a few
minutes,with diverging beams. At its base,a bright point was slipping along the
LB and ultimately invaded the umbra of the sunspot.The H{\alpha} profiles of
the bright points enhanced the intensity in the wings, similarly to the case of
Ellerman bombs.Co-temporally,the extreme ultraviolet brightenings developed at
the front of the dark material jet and moved at the same speed as the fan,
leading us to propose that the fan-shaped jet material compressed and heated
the ambient plasma at its extremities in the corona.Our multi-wavelength
analysis indicates that the fan-shaped jet could result from magnetic
reconnection across the highly diverging field low in the chromosphere,leading
to an apparent slipping motion of the jet material along the LB.However,we did
not find any opposite magnetic polarity at the jet base,as would typically be
expected in such a configuration.We therefore discuss other plausible physical
mechanisms,based on waves and convection, that may have triggered the event.

segmentation and have achieved considerable performance. However, the
performance may be significantly affected by the domain gap between training

we propose a data manipulation based domain generalization method, called
Automated Augmentation for Domain Generalization (AADG). Our AADG framework can
effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and
diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we
introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented
novel domains as measured by the Sinkhorn distance in a unit sphere space,
making automated augmentation tractable. Adversarial training and deep
reinforcement learning are employed to efficiently search the objectives.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 11 publicly-accessible fundus image
datasets (four for retinal vessel segmentation, four for optic disc and cup
(OD/OC) segmentation and three for retinal lesion segmentation) are
comprehensively performed. Two OCTA datasets for retinal vasculature
segmentation are further involved to validate cross-modality generalization.
Our proposed AADG exhibits state-of-the-art generalization performance and
outperforms existing approaches by considerable margins on retinal vessel,
OD/OC and lesion segmentation tasks. The learned policies are empirically
validated to be model-agnostic and can transfer well to other models. The

$\sim$300 m at our observing frequency of 154 MHz, where the phase variance on

variance with that inferred with previous measurements of refractive shifts,
which are most sensitive to scales almost an order of magnitude larger. The two

between these two metrics is in line with what would be expected if the
ionosphere's structure is described by Kolmogorov turbulence between the

work is to suggest architectures that inherit the computational efficiency and
scalability of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and the distributed
nature of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). In this
direction, two frameworks are introduced. The first one called Nested
Distributed DDP (ND-DDP), is a three-level architecture which employs ADMM for
enforcing a consensus between all agents, an augmented Lagrangian layer for
satisfying local constraints and DDP as each agent's optimizer. In the second
approach, both consensus and local constraints are handled with ADMM, yielding
a two-level architecture called Merged Distributed DDP (MD-DDP), which further
reduces computational complexity. Both frameworks are fully decentralized since
all computations are parallelizable among the agents and only local
communication is necessary. Simulation results that scale up to thousands of
vehicles and hundreds of drones verify the effectiveness of the methods.
Superior scalability to large-scale systems against centralized DDP and
centralized/decentralized sequential quadratic programming is also illustrated.
Finally, hardware experiments on a multi-robot platform demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed algorithms, while highlighting the importance of
optimizing for feedback policies to increase robustness against uncertainty. A

efficiently and effectively model the 3D self-attention of video data has been
a great challenge for transformers. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Patch
Shift (TPS) method for efficient 3D self-attention modeling in transformers for
video-based action recognition. TPS shifts part of patches with a specific
mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, thus converting a vanilla spatial
self-attention operation to a spatiotemporal one with little additional cost.
As a result, we can compute 3D self-attention using nearly the same computation
and memory cost as 2D self-attention. TPS is a plug-and-play module and can be
inserted into existing 2D transformer models to enhance spatiotemporal feature
learning. The proposed method achieves competitive performance with

pneumonia, corresponding to community-acquired and hospital-acquired
infections. We show that the existence and local stability of equilibria depend
on three different parameters, which are interpreted as the basic reproduction

simulations are performed to complement our theoretical analysis, and we show
that both diseases can persist if the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is
greater than one.

adaptive approximation of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations
whose solutions may have singularities, by deep neural networks (DNNs) with a

intrinsic multi-scale structure which is favorable for adaptive representation
of functions, by employing a penalty with multiple parameters, we develop DNNs
with a multi-scale sparse regularization (SDNN) for effectively representing

still underwhelming. A concept known as imagefication-based intelligent FDC has
been studied in recent years. This concept advocates to stack the sensors
measurement data into an image format, the sensors FDC issue is then
transformed to abnormal regions detection problem on the stacked image, which
may well borrow the recent advances in the machine vision vision realm.
Although promising results have been claimed in the imagefication-based
intelligent FDC researches, due to the low size of the stacked image, small
convolutional kernels and shallow DNN layers were used, which hinders the FDC
performance. In this paper, we first propose a data augmentation method which
inflates the stacked image to a larger size (correspondent to the VGG16 net
developed in the machine vision realm). The FDC neural network is then trained
via fine-tuning the VGG16 directly. To truncate and compress the FDC net size
(hence its running time), we perform model pruning on the fine-tuned net. Class
activation mapping (CAM) method is also adopted for explainability analysis of
the FDC net to verify its internal operations. Via data augmentation,
fine-tuning from VGG16, and model pruning, the FDC net developed in this paper
claims an FDC accuracy 98.90% across 4 aircraft at 5 flight conditions (running
time 26 ms). The CAM results also verify the FDC net w.r.t. its internal

encouraging the correct room connectivity with our proposed geometric loss. We

One of the proposed scenarios for the formation of warps involves tidal
interactions among galaxies. A recent study identified a stellar warp in the
outer regions of the south-western (SW) disk of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) and suggested that it might have originated due to the tidal interaction
between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Due to the limited
spatial coverage of the data, the authors could not investigate the counterpart
of this warp in the north-eastern (NE) region, which is essential to
understanding the global shape, nature, and origin of the outer LMC warp. In
this work, we study the structure of the LMC disk using data on red clump stars
from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), which cover the entire Magellanic
system. We detected a warp in the NE outer LMC disk which is deviated from the
disk plane in the same direction as that of the SW outer warp, but with a lower
amplitude. This suggests that the outer LMC disk has an asymmetric stellar
warp, which is likely to be a U-shaped warp. Our result provides an
observational constraint to the theoretical models of the Magellanic system

report the first observation of the concurrent breakdown of the SM normal state
and superconductivity at a pressure-induced quantum critical point in an
iron-pnictide superconductor, Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe0.97Pt0.03)2As2)5. We find that,
upon suppressing the superconducting state by applying pressure, the power
exponent changes from 1 to 2, and the corresponding coefficient A, the slope of
the temperature-linear resistivity per FeAs layer, gradually diminishes. At a
critical pressure (12.5 GPa), A and Tc go to zero concurrently,where a quantum
phase transition (QPT) from a superconducting state with a SM normal state to a
non-superconducting Fermi liquid state takes place. Scaling analysis on the
results obtained from the pressurized 1048 superconductor reveals that A and Tc
have a positive relation, which exhibits a similarity with that is seen in
other chemically-doped unconventional superconductors, regardless of the type
of the tuning method (doping or pressurizing), the crystal structure, the bulk

generate short addition chains. We firstly present a Simplified Power-tree
method by deeply deleting the power-tree, whose time complexity is reduced to
O($k^2$) sacrificing some increasing of the addition chain length. Moreover, a
Cross Window method and its variant are introduced by improving the Window
method. More precisely, the Cross Window method uses the cross correlation to
deal with the windows and its pre-computation is optimized by the Addition
Sequence algorithm. The theoretical analysis is conducted to show the
correctness and effectiveness. Meanwhile, the experiment shows that the new
methods can obtain shorter addition chains compared to the existing methods.
The Cross Window method with the Addition Sequence algorithm can attain 9.5%
reduction of the addition chain length, in the best case, compared to the

increasing attention in the networking and machine learning communities thanks
to their versatility in modeling decentralized learning problems over

networks with limited computation and communication capabilities, how to
achieve low sample and communication complexities are two fundamental
challenges that remain under-explored so far. In this paper, we make the first
attempt to investigate the class of decentralized bilevel optimization problems
with nonconvex and strongly-convex structure corresponding to the outer and
inner subproblems, respectively. Our main contributions in this paper are
two-fold: i) We first propose a deterministic algorithm called INTERACT
(inner-gradient-descent-outer-tracked-gradient) that requires the sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \epsilon^{-1})$ and communication complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ to solve the bilevel optimization problem, where
$n$ and $\epsilon > 0$ are the number of samples at each agent and the desired
stationarity gap, respectively. ii) To relax the need for full gradient
evaluations in each iteration, we propose a stochastic variance-reduced version
of INTERACT (SVR-INTERACT), which improves the sample complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n} \epsilon^{-1})$ while achieving the same communication
complexity as the deterministic algorithm. To our knowledge, this work is the
first that achieves both low sample and communication complexities for solving
decentralized bilevel optimization problems over networks. Our numerical

describing the interaction of light and matter, and more importantly, the QRM
contains rich physics deserving further exploration despite its simplicity.
Here we propose a scheme consisting of two successive diagonalization to
accurately obtain the ground-state and excited states wavefunctions of the QRM
in full parameter regime ranging from weak to deep-strong couplings. Thus one
is able to see how the phase transition happens and how the photons populate in
Fock space of the superradiant phase. We characterize the photon populations by
borrowing the distribution concept in random matrix theory and find that the
photon population follows a Poissonian-like distribution once the phase
transition happens and further exhibits the statistics of Gaussian unitary
ensemble as increasing coupling strength. More interestingly, the photons in
the excited states behave even like the statistics of Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble. Our results not only deepen understanding on the superradiant phase
transition but also provide an insight on the nature of the superradiant phase
of the QRM and related models.

conditional generation models, leading to learning only the recolorization or

vector quantization technique into the image-to-image translation framework.
The vector quantized content representation can facilitate not only the
translation, but also the unconditional distribution shared among different
domains. Meanwhile, along with the disentangled style representation, the
proposed method further enables the capability of image extension with
flexibility in both intra- and inter-domains. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable performance to
the state-of-the-art image-to-image translation and image extension methods.
Compared to methods for individual tasks, the proposed method, as a unified

unconditional generation, and image extension altogether. For example, it
provides style variability for image generation and extension, and equips
image-to-image translation with further extension capabilities.

characteristic of many real-world datasets. Many imputation methods have been
proposed to address this problem of data incompleteness or sparsity. However,
the accuracy of a data imputation method for a given feature or a set of
features in a dataset is highly dependent on the distribution of the feature
values and its correlation with other features. Another problem that plagues
industry deployments of machine learning (ML) solutions is concept drift
detection, which becomes more challenging in the presence of missing values.
Although data imputation and concept drift detection have been studied
extensively, little work has attempted a combined study of the two phenomena,
i.e., concept drift detection in the presence of sparsity. In this work, we
carry out a systematic study of the following: (i) different patterns of
missing values, (ii) various statistical and ML based data imputation methods
for different kinds of sparsity, (iii) several concept drift detection methods,
(iv) practical analysis of the various drift detection metrics, (v) selecting
the best concept drift detector given a dataset with missing values based on
the different metrics. We first analyze it on synthetic data and publicly
available datasets, and finally extend the findings to our deployed solution of
automated change risk assessment system. One of the major findings from our
empirical study is the absence of supremacy of any one concept drift detection
method across all the relevant metrics. Therefore, we adopt a majority voting
based ensemble of concept drift detectors for abrupt and gradual concept
drifts. Our experiments show optimal or near optimal performance can be
achieved for this ensemble method across all the metrics.

complex organics and show moderate to high activity. We studied the formation
of a large number of CHO molecules, N-bearing molecules and the simplest amino

for HCOOH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$COOH, HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, and

total production rates. However, the production rates for C$_2$H$_5$OH,
(CH$_2$OH)$_2$ , CH$_2$OHCHO and the simplest amino acid glycine are low for
most comets; therefore, their formation requires surface chemistry almost
solely. We also found that factors such as initial cometary abundance, relative
abundances of the reactants and temperature of the reacting species

predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar

First, we focus on a fact that the static quark-antiquark potential is
independent of spatial gauge fields. We explicitly confirm this by performing
$\vec{A} = 0$ projection, where spatial gauge fields are all set to zero. We
also apply the $\vec{A} = 0$ projection to light hadron masses and find that
nucleon and delta baryon masses are almost degenerate, suggesting vanishing of
the color-magnetic interactions. After considering the physical meaning of the
$\vec{A} = 0$ projection, we next propose a generalized projection, where
spatial gauge fields are expanded in terms of Faddeev-Popov eigenmodes and only
some eigenmodes are left. We apply the proposed projection to light hadron and
glueball masses and find that the $N-\Delta$ and $0^{++}-2^{++}$ mass
splittings become evident when projected with more than 33 (0.10 \%) low-lying
eigenmodes, suggesting emergence of the color-magnetic interactions. We also
find that the original hadron masses are approximately reproduced with just 328

discrete sine transform (R-DST). The original DST \textit{leaks} the lowest
frequency (DC: direct current) components of signals into high frequency (AC:
alternating current) subbands. This property is not desired in many
applications, particularly image processing, since most of the frequency
components in natural images concentrate in DC subband. The characteristic of
filter banks whereby they do not leak DC components into the AC subbands is
called \textit{regularity}. While an R-DST has been proposed, it has no fast
implementation because of the singular value decomposition (SVD) in its
internal algorithm. In contrast, the proposed regularity-constrained fast sine
transform (R-FST) is obtained by just appending a regularity constraint matrix
as a postprocessing of the original DST. When the DST size is $M\times M$
($M=2^\ell$, $\ell\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}$), the regularity constraint matrix is
constructed from only $M/2-1$ rotation matrices with the angles derived from
the output of the DST for the constant-valued signal (i.e., the DC signal).
Since it does not require SVD, the computation is simpler and faster than the
R-DST while keeping all of its beneficial properties. An image processing
example shows that the R-FST has fine frequency selectivity with no DC leakage
and higher coding gain than the original DST. Also, in the case of $M=8$, the
R-FST saved approximately $0.126$ seconds in a 2-D transformation of $512\times
512$ signals compared with the R-DST because of fewer extra operations.

solutions to mitigation of coastal risks like coastal forests, but it remains
unclear how much protective benefits vegetation provides, particularly in the
limit of highly energetic flows after tsunami impact. The current study, using
a three-dimensional incompressible computational fluid dynamics model with a
fluid-structure interaction approach, aims to quantify how energy reflection
and dissipation vary with different degrees of rigidity and vegetation density
of a coastal forest.
  We represent tree trunks as cylinders and use the elastic modulus of hardwood
trees such as pine or oak to characterize the rigidity of these cylinders. The
numerical results show that energy reflection increases with rigidity only for
a single cylinder. In the presence of multiple cylinders, the difference in
energy reflection created by varying rigidity diminishes as the number of
cylinders increases. Instead of rigidity, we find that the blockage area
created by the presence of multiple tree trunks dominates energy reflection. As
tree trunks are deformed by the hydrodynamic forces, they alter the flow field
around them, causing turbulent kinetic energy generation in the wake region. As
a consequence, trees dissipate flow energy, highlighting coastal forests
reducing the onshore energy flux of tsunamis by means of both reflection and
dissipation.

95-98% of the peak heat flux to the target is mitigated as a synergetic effect
of ADCs, baffling, and nitrogen seeded detachment. The effect of divertor

Federated Selective Aggregation (FedSA). The goal of FedSA is to train a
student model for a new task with the help of several decentralized teachers,
whose pre-training tasks and data are different and agnostic. Our motivation
for investigating such a problem setup stems from a recent dilemma of model
sharing. Many researchers or institutes have spent enormous resources on
training large and competent networks. Due to the privacy, security, or
intellectual property issues, they are, however, not able to share their own
pre-trained models, even if they wish to contribute to the community. The
proposed FedSA offers a solution to this dilemma and makes it one step further
since, again, the learned student may specialize in a new task different from
all of the teachers. To this end, we proposed a dedicated strategy for handling
FedSA. Specifically, our student-training process is driven by a novel
saliency-based approach that adaptively selects teachers as the participants
and integrates their representative capabilities into the student. To evaluate
the effectiveness of FedSA, we conduct experiments on both single-task and
multi-task settings. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA effectively
amalgamates knowledge from decentralized models and achieves competitive
performance to centralized baselines.

we argue that neither of the assumptions applies to SGG: there are numerous
noisy ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions and harm
the training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we propose a novel NoIsy
label CorrEction and Sample Training strategy for SGG: NICEST. Specifically, it
consists of two parts: NICE and NIST, which rule out these noisy label issues
by generating high-quality samples and the effective training strategy,
respectively. NICE first detects noisy samples and then reassigns them more
high-quality soft predicate labels. NIST is a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation based training strategy, which enables the model to learn unbiased
fusion knowledge. And a dynamic trade-off weighting strategy in NIST is
designed to penalize the bias of different teachers. Due to the model-agnostic
nature of both NICE and NIST, our NICEST can be seamlessly incorporated into
any SGG architecture to boost its performance on different predicate
categories. In addition, to better evaluate the generalization of SGG models,
we further propose a new benchmark VG-OOD, by re-organizing the prevalent VG
dataset and deliberately making the predicate distributions of the training and
test sets as different as possible for each subject-object category pair. This
new benchmark helps disentangle the influence of subject-object category based
frequency biases. Extensive ablations and results on different backbones and

reveal extreme sensitivity of droplet motion to the presence of macromolecular

mode-switching, from the conventional pusher mode to a puller mode of
propulsion, characterized by a more persistent droplet motion. With a further
increase in concentration, a secondary transition from smooth to a jittery mode

photosphere, $\eta$, provides an important guide for identifying viscous
accretion disks, with $\eta=1$ (""transition line"") and $\eta=5$ (""sufficient
dominance line"") marking turning points in diagnostics, evaluated here in the
near-infrared. These turning points indicate the emergence and complete
development of FUor-characteristic strong CO absorption, weak metallic
absorption, the triangular spectral continuum shape in the $H$-band, and
location in color-magnitude diagrams. Lower stellar mass $M_*$ and higher
accretion rate $\dot{M}$ lead to larger $\eta$; for $M_*=0.3~{\rm M_\odot}$,
$\eta=1$ corresponds to $\dot{M}=2\times10^{-7}~{\rm M_\odot}/$yr and $\eta=5$
to $\dot{M}=6\times10^{-7}~{\rm M_\odot}/$yr. The sufficient dominance line
also coincides with the expected accretion rate where accreting material
directly reaches the star. We discuss implications of the models on extinction
diagnostics, FUor brightening timescales, viscous disks during initial
protostellar growth, and eruptive young stellar objects (YSO) associated with
FUors.

modern vision-language transformers, and propose a simple yet powerful
Selective Retraining (SiRi) mechanism for this challenging task. Particularly,
SiRi conveys a significant principle to the research of visual grounding, i.e.,
a better initialized vision-language encoder would help the model converge to a
better local minimum, advancing the performance accordingly. In specific, we
continually update the parameters of the encoder as the training goes on, while
periodically re-initialize rest of the parameters to compel the model to be
better optimized based on an enhanced encoder. SiRi can significantly
outperform previous approaches on three popular benchmarks. Specifically, our
method achieves 83.04% Top1 accuracy on RefCOCO+ testA, outperforming the
state-of-the-art approaches (training from scratch) by more than 10.21%.
Additionally, we reveal that SiRi performs surprisingly superior even with

point cloud learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Although existing 3D attack methods achieve high success rates, they
delve into the data space with point-wise perturbation, which may neglect the
geometric characteristics. Instead, we propose point cloud attacks from a new
perspective -- the graph spectral domain attack, aiming to perturb graph
transform coefficients in the spectral domain that corresponds to varying
certain geometric structure. Specifically, leveraging on graph signal
processing, we first adaptively transform the coordinates of points onto the
spectral domain via graph Fourier transform (GFT) for compact representation.
Then, we analyze the influence of different spectral bands on the geometric
structure, based on which we propose to perturb the GFT coefficients via a
learnable graph spectral filter. Considering the low-frequency components
mainly contribute to the rough shape of the 3D object, we further introduce a
low-frequency constraint to limit perturbations within imperceptible
high-frequency components. Finally, the adversarial point cloud is generated by
transforming the perturbed spectral representation back to the data domain via
the inverse GFT. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed attack in terms of both the imperceptibility and attack success rates.

non-maximal $\theta_{23}$ for possible $CP$ violation measurable in neutrino

We also present a heuristic segmentation algorithm that can even segment

frequency, and the exponentially decaying time surface, and apply video frame
reconstruction using a deep neural network called FireNet. We use the deep
convolutional neural network YOLOv4 as a detector. For particular
representations, we obtain a detection accuracy in the range of 86.9-88.9%
mAP@0.5. The use of a fusion of the considered representations allows us to
obtain a detector with higher accuracy of 89.9% mAP@0.5. In comparison, the
detector for the frames reconstructed with FireNet is characterised by an
accuracy of 72.67% mAP@0.5. The results obtained illustrate the potential of
event cameras in automotive applications, either as standalone sensors or in
close cooperation with typical frame-based cameras.

mixed influence on the growth of other planetary embryos. Gravitational
perturbation from the planet can increase the relative velocities of
planetesimals at the mean motion resonances to very high values and impede
accretion at those locations. However, gas drag can also align the orbital
pericenters of equal-size planetesimals in certain disk locations and make them
dynamically quiet and ""accretion-friendly"" locations for planetesimals of
similar sizes. Following the previous paper, where we investigated the effect
of a Jupiter-like planet on an external planetesimal disk, we generalize our
findings to extrasolar planetary systems by varying the planet parameters. In
particular, we focus on the dependence of the planetesimal relative velocities
on the mass and eccentricity of the existing planet. We found that the velocity
dispersion of identical-mass particles increases monotonically with increasing
planet mass. Meanwhile, the dependence of the relative velocity between
different-mass planetesimals on their mass ratio becomes weaker as the planet
mass increases. While the relative velocities generally increases with
increasing planet eccentricity, the velocity dispersion of smaller-mass
particles ($m \lesssim 10^{18}~\rm{g}$) is almost independent of planet
eccentricity owing to their strong coupling to gas. We find that the erosion
limits are met for a wider range of parameters (planet mass/eccentricity,
planetesimal mass ratio) when the planetesimal size decreases. Our results
could provide some clues for the formation of Saturn's core as well as the
architecture of some exoplanetary systems with multiple cold giant planets.

multiple protocols, the hydrogels consistently exhibit power-law
viscoelasticity in the linear viscoelastic regime with an exponent $\beta =

undergoes stiffening and energy dissipation, indicating simultaneous alignment
and unfolding of the folded proteins. Remarkably, this behaviour is highly
reversible, as the value of $\beta$, $d_f$ and the viscoelastic moduli return
to their equilibrium value, even after multiple cycles of deformation. This
highlights a previously unrevealed diversity of viscoelastic properties that

does not evolve with redshift, we use these measurements in order to estimate
the expected AGN cavity power in the core of each system. We estimate the X-ray
luminosity within the cooling radius $L_{\mathrm{cool}}$ of each cluster from a
joint analysis of the available $Chandra$ X-ray and SPT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)

$P_{\mathrm{cav}} / L_{\mathrm{cool}}$ ratio. When combined with low-redshift
results, these constraints enable investigations of the properties of the
feedback/cooling cycle across 9~Gyr of cluster growth. We model the redshift
evolution of this ratio measured for cool core clusters by a log-normal
distribution $\mathrm{Log}$-$\mathcal{N}(\alpha + \beta z, \sigma^2)$ and
constrain the slope of the mean evolution $\beta = -0.05\pm 0.47$. This
analysis improves the constraints on the slope of this relation by a factor of
two. We find no evidence of redshift evolution of the feedback/cooling

Implementing new maintenance operations often necessitates modifications in the

Such modifications are only possible with a new DRAM standard, which takes a

  In this paper, our goal is to 1) ease, and thus accelerate, the process of
enabling new DRAM maintenance operations and 2) enable more efficient in-DRAM
maintenance operations. Our idea is to set the memory controller free from
managing DRAM maintenance. To this end, we propose Self-Managing DRAM (SMD), a

enables easy adoption of efficient maintenance mechanisms that significantly

reliability compared to conventional DDR4 DRAM. A combination of SMD-based
maintenance mechanisms that perform refresh, RowHammer protection, and memory

associated with any undetected X-ray cavities. We place upper limits on any
significant X-ray AGN in the brightest cluster galaxy, and show that the X-ray
peak is offset from the central radio source, which exhibits a steep low
frequency radio spectrum indicative of electron ageing. The SOAR data reveal an
extended, luminous emission line source. From our narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging
of the BCG, the central H$\alpha$ peak is coincident with the radio
observations, yet offset from the X-ray peak, consistent with sloshing found
previously in this cluster. ALMA observations reveal a large reservoir of
molecular gas that traces the extended H$\alpha$ emission. We conclude either
that the radio source and its cavities in the X-ray gas are nearly aligned
along the line of sight, or that ram pressure induced by sloshing has
significantly displaced the cool molecular gas feeding it, perhaps preempting
the AGN feedback cycle. We argue that the sloshing near the core is likely
subsonic, as expected, given the co-location of the H$\alpha$, CO(1-0), radio

multi-level features with our Attention-induced Cross-level Fusion Module
(ACFM), which further integrates the features under the guidance of attention
coefficients. We then propose a Dual-branch Global Context Module (DGCM) to
refine the fused features for informative feature representations by exploiting
rich global context information. Multiple ACFMs and DGCMs are integrated in a
cascaded manner for generating a coarse prediction from high-level features.
The coarse prediction acts as an attention map to refine the low-level features
before passing them to our Camouflage Inference Module (CIM) to generate the
final prediction. We perform extensive experiments on three widely used
benchmark datasets and compare C2F-Net with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The
results show that C2F-Net is an effective COD model and outperforms SOTA models
remarkably. Further, an evaluation on polyp segmentation datasets demonstrates
the promising potentials of our C2F-Net in COD downstream applications. Our

maps data points to a latent space, and a clustering head that groups data
points into clusters in the latent space. Although the two components used to
be trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion, recent works have proved it
beneficial to train them separately in two stages. In the first stage, the
feature extractor is trained via self-supervised learning, which enables the
preservation of the cluster structures among the data points. To preserve the
cluster structures even better, we propose to replace the first stage with
another model that is pretrained on a much larger dataset via self-supervised

we have empirically shown that it can achieve superior clustering performance.
When a vision transformer (ViT) architecture is used for feature extraction,

new complex scalar both having nonzero chemical potentials can be asymmetric DM
particles. After the spontaneous breaking of a U(1)$^{}_\textsf{D}$ dark gauge
symmetry, these two particles can have accidental $\mathbb{Z}^{}_4$ charges
making them stable. By adding one more complex scalar as a mediator between the
SIMP DM, the relic density of DM is determined by $3 \to 2$ and two-loop
induced $2 \to 2$ annihilations in this model. On the other hand, the SIMP DM
can maintain kinetic equilibrium with the thermal bath until the DM freeze-out
temperature via the new gauge interaction. Interestingly, this model can have a
bouncing effect on DM, whereby the DM number density rises after the chemical
freeze-out of DM. With this effect, the prediction of the DM self-interacting
cross section in this model can be consistent with astrophysical observations,
and the ratio of the DM energy density to the baryonic matter energy density
can be explained by primordial asymmetries. We also predict the DM-electron
elastic scattering cross section that can be used to test this model in future

and temporally varying blur. An intuitive approach for video deblurring
includes two steps: a) detecting the blurry region in the current frame; b)
utilizing the information from clear regions in adjacent frames for current
frame deblurring. To realize this process, our idea is to detect the pixel-wise
blur level of each frame and combine it with video deblurring. To this end, we
propose a novel framework that utilizes the motion magnitude prior (MMP) as
guidance for efficient deep video deblurring. Specifically, as the pixel
movement along its trajectory during the exposure time is positively correlated
to the level of motion blur, we first use the average magnitude of optical flow
from the high-frequency sharp frames to generate the synthetic blurry frames
and their corresponding pixel-wise motion magnitude maps. We then build a
dataset including the blurry frame and MMP pairs. The MMP is then learned by a
compact CNN by regression. The MMP consists of both spatial and temporal blur
level information, which can be further integrated into an efficient recurrent
neural network (RNN) for video deblurring. We conduct intensive experiments to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on the public datasets.

the three proposed NLT benchmarks: ImageNet-NLT, Animal10-NLT, and Food101-NLT.
To this end, we design an iterative noisy learning framework called

reducing ""hard"" noises to ""easy"" ones, whose removal further improves the
invariance. Experimental results show that our H2E outperforms state-of-the-art

numerical methods have been proposed and successfully used for various
applications. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown their
superiority for high-dimensional PDEs where traditional methods fail. However,
for low dimensional problems, it remains unclear whether these methods have a
real advantage over traditional algorithms as a direct solver. In this work, we
propose the random feature method (RFM) for solving PDEs, a natural bridge
between traditional and machine learning-based algorithms. RFM is based on a
combination of well-known ideas: 1. representation of the approximate solution
using random feature functions; 2. collocation method to take care of the PDE;
3. the penalty method to treat the boundary conditions, which allows us to
treat the boundary condition and the PDE in the same footing. We find it
crucial to add several additional components including multi-scale
representation and rescaling the weights in the loss function. We demonstrate
that the method exhibits spectral accuracy and can compete with traditional
solvers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we find that RFM
is particularly suited for complex problems with complex geometry, where both

applications in optical communication, super-resolution imaging, and

the light source has been essential for generating OAM beams, as incoherent
ambient light would result in polychromatic and obscured OAM beams in the
visible spectrum. Here, we extend the applications of OAM to ambient lighting
conditions. By miniaturizing spiral phase plates and integrating them with
structural color filters, we achieve spatio-temporal coherence using only an
incoherent white light source. These optical elements act as building blocks
that encode both color and OAM information in the form of colorful optical
vortices. Thus, pairs of transparent substrates that contain matching positions
of these vortices constitute a reciprocal optical lock and key system. Due to
the multiple helical eigenstates of OAM, the pairwise coupling can be further
extended to form a one-to-many matching and validation scheme. Generating and
decoding colorful optical vortices with broadband white light could find
potential applications in anti-counterfeiting, optical metrology, high-capacity

significant sampling of crystal structures on the nanometre scale by means of
Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction (SEND). Characterisation of structural
similarity across this length scale is key to bridging the gap between local
atomic structure (using atomic resolution techniques such as High Resolution
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM)) and the macro-scale (using
bulk techniques such as powder X-ray and neutron diffraction). The use of SEND
technique allows for structural investigation of a broad range of samples, due
to the techniques ability to operate with low electron dosage and its tolerance
for sample thickness, relative to HR-STEM. This, coupled with the capacity for
data collection over a wide areas and the automation of this collection, allows
for statistically representative sampling of the microstructure. Also due to
these factors, SEND generates large datasets and as a result automated/
semi-automated data processing workflows are required to aid in maximal
extraction of useful information. As such, this paper outlines a versatile,
data-driven approach for producing domain maps, as well as a statistical
approach for assessing their applicability. The production of such domain maps
for a dataset can help highlight nuance in the microstructure, as well as
improve the manageability of that dataset for further investigation. The
workflow outlined utilises a Variational AutoEncoder to identify and learn the
sources of variance in the diffraction signal and this, in combination with
clustering techniques, is used to produce domain maps for a set of varied
example cases. This approach: is agnostic to domain crystallinity; requires no
prior knowledge of crystal structure; and does not require the, potentially
prohibitive, simulation of a library of appropriate diffraction patterns.

Fuzzers execute many inputs to maximize the amount of reached code. Recently,
Directed Greybox Fuzzers (DGFs) propose an alternative strategy that goes
beyond ""just"" coverage: driving testing toward specific code targets by
selecting ""closer"" seeds. DGFs go through different phases: exploration (i.e.,
reaching interesting locations) and exploitation (i.e., triggering bugs). In
practice, DGFs leverage coverage to directly measure exploration, while
exploitation is, at best, measured indirectly by alternating between different
targets. Specifically, we observe two limitations in existing DGFs: (i) they
lack precision in their distance metric, i.e., averaging multiple paths and
targets into a single score (to decide which seeds to prioritize), and (ii)
they assign energy to seeds in a round-robin fashion without adjusting the
priority of the targets (exhaustively explored targets should be dropped).
  We propose FishFuzz, which draws inspiration from trawl fishing: first
casting a wide net, scraping for high coverage, then slowly pulling it in to
maximize the harvest. The core of our fuzzer is a novel seed selection strategy
that builds on two concepts: (i) a novel multi-distance metric whose precision
is independent of the number of targets, and (ii) a dynamic target ranking to
automatically discard exhausted targets. This strategy allows FishFuzz to
seamlessly scale to tens of thousands of targets and dynamically alternate
between exploration and exploitation phases. We evaluate FishFuzz by leveraging
all sanitizer labels as targets. Extensively comparing FishFuzz against modern
DGFs and coverage-guided fuzzers shows that FishFuzz reached higher coverage
compared to the direct competitors, reproduces existing bugs (70.2% faster),
and finally discovers 25 new bugs (18 CVEs) in 44 programs.

deconfined state of QCD matter, made of free quarks and gluons, called
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is expected to be formed. To probe such an
environment, the study of quarkonium production is an important tool as the
heavy quarks are produced during the initial stage of the collision and
experience the entire medium evolution. Surprisingly, in small colliding
systems as pp and p--Pb, QGP-like behaviours are observed when selecting high
multiplicity events. The physics interpretation of these behaviours remains
unclear. However, multiparton interaction is one of the main promising
scenarios to explain such observation. Studies of charmonium yields as a

molecules and the perspectives they open not only in evolutionary and synthetic
biology but also in medicine, we will introduce the important notions of energy
and fitness landscapes for these molecules. In Section III we will review some
models and algorithms for RNA sequence-to-secondary-structure mapping. Section
IV discusses how the secondary-structure energy landscape can be derived from
unzipping data. Section V deals with the inference of RNA structure from
evolutionary sequence data sampled in different organisms. This will shift the
focus from the `sequence-to-structure' mapping described in Section III to a
`sequence-to-function' landscape that can be inferred from laboratory
evolutionary data on DNA aptamers. Finally, in Section VI, we shall discuss the
rich theoretical picture linking networks of interacting RNA molecules to the
organization of robust, systemic regulatory programs. Along this path, we will
therefore explore phenomena across multiple scales in space, number of
molecules and time, showing how the biological complexity of the RNA world can
be captured by the unifying concepts of statistical physics.

problem in a finite rectangular grid by autonomous robots. Suppose we are given
a set of identical robots, where each robot is placed on a node of a finite

The $\mathcal{MIS}$ formation problem asks to design an algorithm, executing

execute the same distributed algorithm.
  Previous works solving this problem used one or several door nodes through

the $\mathcal{MIS}$ formation problem in a more generalized scenario, i.e.,
when the total number of required robots to form an $\mathcal{MIS}$ are
arbitrarily placed on the grid. The proposed algorithm works under a
semi-synchronous scheduler using robots with only 2 hop visibility range and

numerical simulations to study the impact of a 2D hill on the sound propagation
for a turbine in non flat terrain. The simulations employed a propagation model
derived from the linearized Euler equations, solved in a moving frame following
the wavefront. The wind turbine noise was modeled using a point source
approach. The flow structure in the atmospheric boundary layer and the wind
turbine wake were obtained from large-eddy simulations. We find that the wind
turbine wake acts as a waveguide that focuses sound propagation towards the
ground. This effect is most pronounced for the flat terrain case and when the
turbine is placed on the hill. The sound attenuation is more localized and
closer to the turbine when the wind turbine is placed on the hilltop than in
the flat case. As the wind speed increases, the sound focusing is observed
closer to the turbine. For a turbine placed in front of the hill, the sound
propagation is mainly determined by the flow over the hill. This demonstrates
that terrain topography can have surprising effects on wind turbine noise
propagation.

neuroscience. Recently, it has been demonstrated as a promising approach for
constructing goal-driven behavior in robotics. Specifically, the active
inference controller (AIC) has been successful on several continuous control
and state-estimation tasks. Despite its relative success, some established
design choices lead to a number of practical limitations for robot control.
These include having a biased estimate of the state, and only an implicit model
of control actions. In this paper, we highlight these limitations and propose
an extended version of the unbiased active inference controller (u-AIC). The
u-AIC maintains all the compelling benefits of the AIC and removes its
limitations. Simulation results on a 2-DOF arm and experiments on a real 7-DOF
manipulator show the improved performance of the u-AIC with respect to the
standard AIC. The code can be found at

different computation costs. The branch to execute can be selected on-demand

can be easily reconfigured after training, even directly on a mobile device. In
addition, the proposed approach shows substantially better overall performance
in comparison to the original MobileNetV2 as tested on CelebA-Spoof dataset.
Different PTA block configurations are sampled at training time, which also

U-Net, have been the prevailing technique in the medical image processing era.
Specifically, the seminal U-Net, as well as its alternatives, have successfully
managed to address a wide variety of medical image segmentation tasks. However,
these architectures are intrinsically imperfect as they fail to exhibit
long-range interactions and spatial dependencies leading to a severe
performance drop in the segmentation of medical images with variable shapes and
structures. Transformers, preliminary proposed for sequence-to-sequence
prediction, have arisen as surrogate architectures to precisely model global
information assisted by the self-attention mechanism. Despite being feasibly
designed, utilizing a pure Transformer for image segmentation purposes can
result in limited localization capacity stemming from inadequate low-level
features. Thus, a line of research strives to design robust variants of
Transformer-based U-Net. In this paper, we propose Trans-Norm, a novel deep
segmentation framework which concomitantly consolidates a Transformer module
into both encoder and skip-connections of the standard U-Net. We argue that the
expedient design of skip-connections can be crucial for accurate segmentation
as it can assist in feature fusion between the expanding and contracting paths.
In this respect, we derive a Spatial Normalization mechanism from the
Transformer module to adaptively recalibrate the skip connection path.
Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for medical image segmentation
demonstrate the effectiveness of TransNorm. The codes and trained models are

omega-regular transducers equipped with B\""uchi conditions -- that rewrite
strings and associate a cost sequence to these rewritings. To translate the
resulting cost-sequences to easily interpretable payoffs, we consider several
aggregator functions to map cost sequences to numbers -- including limit
superior, supremum, discounted-sum, and average-sum -- to define quantitative
cost semantics. The problem of optimal repair, then, is to determine whether
traces from a given system can be rewritten to satisfy an $\omega$-regular
property when the allowed cost is bounded by a given threshold. We also
consider the dual challenge of impair verification that assumes that the
rewritings are resolved adversarially under some given cost restriction, and
asks to decide if all traces of the system satisfy the specification
irrespective of the rewritings. With a negative result to the impair
verification problem, we study the problem of designing a minimal mask of the
Kripke structure such that the resulting traces satisfy the specifications
despite the threshold-bounded impairment. We dub this problem as the mask
synthesis problem. This paper presents automata-theoretic solutions to repair
synthesis, impair verification, and mask synthesis problem for limit superior,

attention due to their widespread use in various applications. Recently, the
deployed DNNs have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to Trojan attacks, which
manipulate model parameters with bit flips to inject a hidden behavior and
activate it by a specific trigger pattern. However, all existing Trojan attacks
adopt noticeable patch-based triggers (e.g., a square pattern), making them
perceptible to humans and easy to be spotted by machines. In this paper, we
present a novel attack, namely hardly perceptible Trojan attack (HPT). HPT
crafts hardly perceptible Trojan images by utilizing the additive noise and per
pixel flow field to tweak the pixel values and positions of the original
images, respectively. To achieve superior attack performance, we propose to
jointly optimize bit flips, additive noise, and flow field. Since the weight
bits of the DNNs are binary, this problem is very hard to be solved. We handle
the binary constraint with equivalent replacement and provide an effective
optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet

images, while achieving comparable or better attack performance compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at:

the band edge. At the same time, NPLs have finite lateral dimensions such that
NPLs are not true extended 2D structures. Here we study the photophysics and
gain properties of CdSe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell NPLs upon electrochemical n
doping and optical excitation. Steady-state absorption and PL spectroscopy show
that excitonic effects are weaker in core-shell-shell nanoplatelets due to the
reduced exciton binding energy. Transient absorption studies reveal a gain
threshold of only one excitation per nanoplatelet. Using electrochemical n
doping we observe the complete bleaching of the band edge exciton transitions.
Combining electrochemical doping with transient absorption spectroscopy we
demonstrate that the gain threshold is fully removed over a broad spectral
range and gain coefficients of several thousand cm-1 are obtained. These doped
NPLs are the best performing colloidal nanomaterial gain medium reported to
date. The low exciton binding energy due to the CdS and ZnS shells, in
combination with the relatively small lateral size of the NPLs, result in
excited states that are effectively delocalised over the entire platelet.
Core-shell NPLs are thus on the border between strong confinement in QDs and
dominant Coulombic effects in 2D materials. We demonstrate that this limit is
in effect ideal for optical gain, and that it results in an optimal lateral
size of the platelets where the gain threshold per nm2 is minimal.

this end, we first apply a multiscale scanning procedure on STED microscopy
measurements of the sample to obtain a system of significant regions, each of

system of regions will typically be highly redundant and consists of
rectangular building blocks. To choose an informative but non-redundant subset

order of the resolution of the microscope. Using multiple photon coincidence
measurements of the same sample in confocal mode, we are then able to estimate
the brightness and number of the molecules and give uniform confidence
intervals on the molecule counts for each previously constructed segment. In

RGB space and conducting interpolation between RGB segmentation maps and
original images. Specifically, we design a fine-tuning strategy to
progressively tune an image generator into a segmentation generator, where the
supervision of the generator varying from images to segmentation maps by

segmentation stream to generate task-specific features, and an image stream to
provide spatial constraints. The image stream can be regarded as a
self-supervised auto-encoder, and this enables our model to benefit from
large-scale support images. Overall, this work is an attempt to explore the
internal relevance between generation tasks and perception tasks by prompt
designing. Extensive experiments show that our model can achieve

concept drift challenge in data has been ignored or poorly handled by the
majority of the anomaly detection frameworks. The state-of-the-art approaches
assume that the data distribution at training and deployment time will be the
same. However, due to various real-life environmental factors, the data may
encounter drift in its distribution or can drift from one class to another in
the late future. Thus, a one-time trained model might not perform adequately.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of concept drift on
various detection models and propose a modified Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model
(AGMM) based framework for anomaly detection in multimedia data. In contrast to
the baseline AGMM, the proposed extension of AGMM remembers the past for a
longer period in order to handle the drift better. Extensive experimental

small and not discernible on its own). In this work, we propose a novel
framework for scene graph generation that addresses this limitation, as well as
introduces dynamic conditioning on the image, using message passing in a Markov
Random Field. This is implemented as an iterative refinement procedure wherein
each modification is conditioned on the graph generated in the previous
iteration. This conditioning across refinement steps allows joint reasoning
over entities and relations. This framework is realized via a novel and
end-to-end trainable transformer-based architecture. In addition, the proposed
framework can improve existing approach performance. Through extensive
experiments on Visual Genome and Action Genome benchmark datasets we show
improved performance on the scene graph generation.

posing significant challenges to machine learning algorithms. Recently neural
network architectures have been widely applied to the problem of time series
forecasting. Most of these models are trained by minimizing a loss function
that measures predictions' deviation from the real values. Typical loss
functions include mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In
the presence of noise and uncertainty, neural network models tend to replicate
the last observed value of the time series, thus limiting their applicability
to real-world data. In this paper, we provide a formal definition of the above
problem and we also give some examples of forecasts where the problem is
observed. We also propose a regularization term penalizing the replication of
previously seen values. We evaluate the proposed regularization term both on
synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the regularization
term mitigates to some extent the aforementioned problem and gives rise to more
robust models.

(NLVL). Almost all existing works follow the ""only look once"" framework that
exploits a single model to directly capture the complex cross- and self-modal
relations among video-query pairs and retrieve the relevant segment. However,
we argue that these methods have overlooked two indispensable characteristics
of an ideal localization method: 1) Frame-differentiable: considering the
imbalance of positive/negative video frames, it is effective to highlight
positive frames and weaken negative ones during the localization. 2)
Boundary-precise: to predict the exact segment boundary, the model should
capture more fine-grained differences between consecutive frames since their
variations are often smooth. To this end, inspired by how humans perceive and
localize a segment, we propose a two-step human-like framework called
Skimming-Locating-Perusing (SLP). SLP consists of a Skimming-and-Locating (SL)
module and a Bi-directional Perusing (BP) module. The SL module first refers to
the query semantic and selects the best matched frame from the video while
filtering out irrelevant frames. Then, the BP module constructs an initial
segment based on this frame, and dynamically updates it by exploring its
adjacent frames until no frame shares the same activity semantic. Experimental
results on three challenging benchmarks show that our SLP is superior to the
state-of-the-art methods and localizes more precise segment boundaries.

to understand galaxy interactions and mergers. In observations they are usually
defined by setting a maximum separation in the sky and in velocity along the
line of sight, and finding galaxies within these ranges. However, when
observing the sky, projection effects can affect the results, by creating
spurious pairs that are not close in physical distance. In this work we mimic
these observational techniques to find pairs in The Three Hundred simulations
of clusters of galaxies. The galaxies' 3D coordinates are projected into 2D,
with Hubble flow included for their line-of-sight velocities. The pairs found
are classified into ""good"" or ""bad"" depending on whether their 3D separations
are within the 2D spatial limit or not. We find that the fraction of good pairs
can be between 30 and 60 per cent depending on the thresholds used in
observations. Studying the ratios of observable properties between the pair
member galaxies, we find that the likelihood of a pair being ""good"" can be
increased by around 40, 20 and 30 per cent if the given pair has, respectively,
a mass ratio below 0.2, metallicity ratio above 0.8, or colour ratio below 0.8.
Moreover, shape and stellar-to-halo mass ratios respectively below 0.4 and 0.2
can increase the likelihood by 50 to 100 per cent. These results suggest that
these properties can be used to increase the chance of finding good pairs in
observations of galaxy clusters and their environment.

multimedia information retrieval. Although previous TSG methods have achieved
decent performance, they tend to capture the selection biases of frequently

reasoning abilities, especially for the rarely appeared pairs. In this paper,
we study the above issue of selection biases and accordingly propose a
Debiasing-TSG (D-TSG) model to filter and remove the negative biases in both
vision and language modalities for enhancing the model generalization ability.
Specifically, we propose to alleviate the issue from two perspectives: 1)
Feature distillation. We built a multi-modal debiasing branch to firstly
capture the vision and language biases, and then apply a bias identification
module to explicitly recognize the true negative biases and remove them from
the benign multi-modal representations. 2) Contrastive sample generation. We
construct two types of negative samples to enforce the model to accurately
learn the aligned multi-modal semantics and make complete semantic reasoning.
We apply the proposed model to both commonly and rarely appeared TSG cases, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on

reconstruction pipelines remains an open problem. While systems that pass the
output of traditional multi-view stereo approaches to a network for
regularisation or refinement currently seem to get the best results, it may be
preferable to treat deep neural networks as separate components whose results
can be probabilistically fused into geometry-based systems. Unfortunately, the
error models required to do this type of fusion are not well understood, with
many different approaches being put forward. Recently, a few systems have
achieved good results by having their networks predict probability
distributions rather than single values. We propose using this approach to fuse
a learned single-view depth prior into a standard 3D reconstruction system.
  Our system is capable of incrementally producing dense depth maps for a set
of keyframes. We train a deep neural network to predict discrete, nonparametric
probability distributions for the depth of each pixel from a single image. We
then fuse this ""probability volume"" with another probability volume based on
the photometric consistency between subsequent frames and the keyframe image.
We argue that combining the probability volumes from these two sources will
result in a volume that is better conditioned. To extract depth maps from the
volume, we minimise a cost function that includes a regularisation term based
on network predicted surface normals and occlusion boundaries. Through a series
of experiments, we demonstrate that each of these components improves the
overall performance of the system.

underground and employ cryogenics to cool down its test masses. While the
underground location provides a quiet site with low seismic noise, the cooling
infrastructure is known to generate large mechanical vibrations due to
cryocooler operation and structural resonances of the cryostat. As cooling
system components are relatively heavy and in close proximity to the test
masses, oscillation of gravity force induced by their vibration, so-called
Newtonian noise, could contaminate the detector sensitivity. In this paper, we
use the results from vibration analysis of the KAGRA cryostat to estimate
cooling system Newtonian noise in the 1-100 Hz frequency band. Our calculations
show that, while this noise does not limit the current detector sensitivity or
inspiral range, it will be an issue in the future when KAGRA improves its

From the optical spectra, we establish that free excitons in InSe are more
likely to be captured by ionized donors due to the large exciton Bohr radius,
leading to the formation of bound exciton complexes. Surprisingly, a pronounced
redshift of the exciton energy accompanied by a decrease of the exciton binding
energy upon hole-doping reveals a significant band gap renormalization and

affected by the interaction. The locations of the action space clusters (i.e.
the orbits of the stream stars) are only preserved by the time-evolving model,
while the time-independent models can lose significant amounts of information
as soon as 0.5--1 Gyr ago, even if the system does not undergo a significant
merger. Our results imply that reverse-integration of stream orbits in the MW

longer than 0.5 Gyr into the past.

regularization by considering geometric configurations in momentum twistor
space corresponding to their leading singularities (LS). Cutting propagators in
momentum twistor space amounts to intersecting lines associated with loop and
external dual momenta, including the special line associated with the point at
infinity, which breaks dual conformal symmetry. We show that cross-ratios of
intersection points on these lines, especially those on the infinity line,
naturally produce symbol letters for Feynman integrals in $D=4-2\epsilon$,
which include and generalize their LS. At one loop, we obtain all symbol
letters using intersection points from quadruple cuts for integrals up to
pentagon kinematics with two massive corners, which agree perfectly with
canonical differential equation (CDE) results. We then obtain all two-loop
letters, for up to four-mass box and one-mass pentagon kinematics, by
considering more intersections arising from two-loop cuts. Finally we comment
on how cluster algebras appear from this construction, and importantly how we
may extend the method to non-planar integrals.

systematic analysis of the $z=0.1$ Fundamental Plane (FP), the tight relation
between galaxy size, mass and velocity dispersion. We first measure the total
mass and velocity dispersion (including both random and rotational motions)
within the effective radius to show that simulated galaxies obey a total mass
FP that is very close to the virial relation ($<10\%$ deviation), indicating
that the effects of non-homology are weak. When we instead use the stellar
mass, we find a strong deviation from the virial plane, which is driven by
variations in the dark matter content. The dark matter fraction is a smooth
function of the size and stellar mass, and thereby sets the coefficients of the
stellar mass FP without substantially increasing the scatter. Hence, both
star-forming and quiescent galaxies obey the same FP, with equally low scatter
(0.02 dex). We employ simulations with a variable stellar initial mass function
(IMF) to show that IMF variations have a modest additional effect on this FP.
Moreover, when we use luminosity-weighted mock observations of the size and
spatially-integrated velocity dispersion, the inferred FP changes only
slightly. However, the scatter increases significantly, due to the
luminosity-weighting and line-of-sight projection of the velocity dispersions,
and measurement uncertainties on the half-light radii. Importantly, we find
significant differences between the simulated FP and observations, which likely
reflects a systematic difference in the stellar mass distributions. Therefore,
we suggest the stellar mass FP offers a simple test for cosmological
simulations, requiring minimal post-processing of simulation data.

that time-based augmentations achieve large performance gains over

wavelengths. A total of 3 spacecraft and 6 ground-based telescopes participated
in this campaign, covering the 52 to 1700~nm wavelength range. After careful
evaluation of the observational data, we focused on the data sets acquired by 4
facilities. We accomplished our primary goal by analyzing the reflectivity
spectrum of the Venus disk over the 283-800 nm wavelengths. Considerable
absorption is present in the 350-450 nm range, for which we retrieved the
corresponding optical depth by the unknown absorber. The result shows a
consistent wavelength dependence of the relative optical depth with that at low
latitudes during the Venus flyby by MESSENGER in 2007 (P\'erez-Hoyos et al.

low latitudes. Last, we summarize the experience obtained during this first

explore in particular the sensitivity to $m_{12}$ in the decays of the lightest
Higgs boson $h$ to two photons, assuming: 1) that $h$ is the state observed at
the LHC at $\sim 125 \ \mathrm{GeV}$, and 2) the $h$ couplings to the SM
particles are SM-like, by going to the alignment limit, $\cos(\beta-\alpha) =

constraints as well as experimental constraints from LHC Higgs rate
measurements, Higgs boson searches, flavor physics and precision observables.
The exploration is performed in the four different Yukawa types of 2HDM, where
the allowed region by all the other constraints depends on the model type. We

to design a novel multi-task, multi-domain learning framework in which a single
segmentation network is optimized over the union of multiple datasets arising
from distinct parts of the anatomy. Unlike previous approaches, we
simultaneously consider multiple intensity domains and segmentation tasks to
overcome the inherent scarcity of pediatric data while leveraging shared
features between imaging datasets. To further improve generalization
capabilities, we employ a transfer learning scheme from natural image
classification, along with a multi-scale contrastive regularization aimed at
promoting domain-specific clusters in the shared representations, and
multi-joint anatomical priors to enforce anatomically consistent predictions.
We evaluate our contributions for performing bone segmentation using three
scarce and pediatric imaging datasets of the ankle, knee, and shoulder joints.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms individual,
transfer, and shared segmentation schemes in Dice metric with statistically
sufficient margins. The proposed model brings new perspectives towards

(1) a Geometric-align Feature Extractor (GaFE) that leverages measured 3D
points to bridge the geometric gap between ground and overhead views, (2) a
Pose Aware Branch (PAB) adopting a triplet loss to encourage pose-aware feature
extraction, and (3) a Recursive Pose Refine Branch (RPRB) using the
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to align the initial pose towards the true
vehicle pose iteratively. Our method is validated on KITTI and Ford Multi-AV
Seasonal datasets as ground view and Google Maps as the satellite view. The
results demonstrate the superiority of our method in cross-view localization
with median spatial and angular errors within $1$ meter and $1^\circ$,
respectively.

semiconductor heterostructures can often be quite challenging. Although density
functional theory has been reasonably successful to carry out such calculations
and efficient and accurate semilocal functionals are desirable to reduce the
computational cost. In general, the semilocal functionals based on the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) significantly underestimate the bulk
band gaps. This, in turn, results in inaccurate estimates of the band offsets
at the heterointerfaces. In this paper, we investigate the performance of
several advanced meta-GGA functionals in the computational prediction of band
offsets at semiconductor heterojunctions. In particular, we investigate the
performance of r2SCAN (revised strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed
functional), rMGGAC (revised semilocal functional based on cuspless hydrogen
model and Pauli kinetic energy density functional), mTASK (modified Aschebrock
and K\""ummel meta-GGA functional), and LMBJ (local modified Becke-Johnson)
exchange-correlation functionals. Our results strongly suggest that these
meta-GGA functionals for supercell calculations perform quite well, especially,
when compared to computationally more demanding GW calculations. We also
present band offsets calculated using ionization potentials and electron
affinities, as well as band alignment via the branch point energies. Overall,
our study shows that the aforementioned meta-GGA functionals can be used within
the DFT framework to estimate the band offsets in semiconductor
heterostructures with predictive accuracy.

non-self-consistently on the Hartree-Fock (HF) density is often recommended as
a computationally cheap remedy for delocalization errors. For sophisticated
meta-GGAs like SCAN, this approach can achieve remarkable accuracy. When this
HF-DFT (or DFA@HF) significantly improves over the DFA, it is often presumed
that the HF density is more accurate than the self-consistent DFA density. By
applying the metrics of density-corrected density functional theory (DFT), we
show that HF-DFT works for barrier heights by making a localizing charge
transfer error or density over-correction, thereby producing a
somewhat-reliable cancellation of density- and functional-driven errors for the
energy. A quantitative analysis of the charge transfer errors in a few
transition states confirms this trend. We do not have the exact functional and
exact densities that are needed to evaluate the exact density- and
functional-driven errors for the large BH76 database of barrier heights.
Instead, we have identified and used three non-local proxy functionals (the
SCAN 50% global hybrid, the range-separated hybrid LC-$\omega$PBE, and
SCAN-FLOSIC) and their self-consistent densities. These functionals yield
reasonably accurate self-consistent barrier heights, and their self-consistent
total energies are nearly piecewise linear in fractional electron number - two
important points of similarity to the exact functional. We argue that
density-driven errors of the energy in a self-consistent density functional
calculation are second-order in the density error, and that large
density-driven errors arise primarily from incorrect electron transfers over
length scales larger than the diameter of an atom.

at zero magnetic fields (antiferromagnetic phase, AFM) in thin film transport,
which coincides with gapless surface states observed by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, while it can become a Chern insulator at field
larger than 6 T (ferromagnetic phase, FM). Thus, the zero-field surface
magnetism was once speculated to be different from the bulk AFM phase. However,
recent magnetic force microscopy refutes this assumption by detecting
persistent AFM order on the surface. In this work, we propose a mechanism
related to surface defects that can rationalize these contradicting

magnetic gap down to several meV in the AFM phase without violating the
magnetic order but preserve the magnetic gap in the FM phase. The different gap
sizes between AFM and FM phases are caused by the defect-induced surface charge
redistribution among top two van der Waals layers. This theory can be validated
by the position- and field-dependent gap in future surface spectroscopy
measurements. Our work suggests suppressing related defects in samples to
realize the quantum anomalous Hall insulator or axion insulator at zero fields.

the timing of the changes. We observe that in general, changes in extremes are
stronger and more rapid over land masses than over oceans. In addition, our
models differentiate between changes in mean, in variability and in
distributional shape, allowing for developments in these statistics to take
place independently and at different times. Different models are presented and
the Bayesian Information Criterion is used for model selection. It turns out
that in most regions, changes in mean and variance take place simultaneously
while the shape parameter of the distribution is predicted to stay constant. In
the Arctic region, however, a different picture emerges: There, climate
variability drastically and abruptly increases around 2050 due to the melting

  Approach",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Combinatorial optimization (CO) layers in machine learning (ML) pipelines are
a powerful tool to tackle data-driven decision tasks, but they come with two
main challenges. First, the solution of a CO problem often behaves as a
piecewise constant function of its objective parameters. Given that ML
pipelines are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent, the absence
of slope information is very detrimental. Second, standard ML losses do not
work well in combinatorial settings. A growing body of research addresses these
challenges through diverse methods. Unfortunately, the lack of well-maintained
implementations slows down the adoption of CO layers.
  In this paper, building upon previous works, we introduce a probabilistic
perspective on CO layers, which lends itself naturally to approximate
differentiation and the construction of structured losses. We recover many
approaches from the literature as special cases, and we also derive new ones.
Based on this unifying perspective, we present InferOpt.jl, an open-source
Julia package that 1) allows turning any CO oracle with a linear objective into
a differentiable layer, and 2) defines adequate losses to train pipelines
containing such layers. Our library works with arbitrary optimization
algorithms, and it is fully compatible with Julia's ML ecosystem. We
demonstrate its abilities using a pathfinding problem on video game maps as
guiding example, as well as three other applications from operations research.

discontinuity of their velocities. This ""breaking"" must satisfy a specific
condition in terms of the Finsler metrics defined by the speed profiles, thus
establishing the generalized Snell's law. In the same way, optimal paths
bouncing off the interface -- without crossing into the second domain --
provide the generalized law of reflection. The classical Snell's and reflection
laws are recovered in this setting when the velocities are isotropic. If one
considers a wave that propagates in all directions from a given ignition point,
the trajectories that globally minimize the traveltime generate the wavefront
at each instant of time. We study in detail the global properties of such
wavefronts in the Euclidean plane with anisotropic speed profiles. Like the
individual rays, they break when they encounter the discontinuity interface.
But they are also broken due to the formation of cut loci -- stemming from the
self-intersection of the wavefronts -- which typically appear when they
approach a high-speed profile domain from a low-speed profile.

followed by a process of connecting each pair of nodes with a probability

feature is system modularity, which offers the possibility to harness agent
specialization, while also enabling system-level upgrades. However, altering
the agents' capacities can change the exploration-exploitation balance required
to maximize the system's performance. Here, we study the effect of a swarm's
heterogeneity on its exploration-exploitation balance while tracking multiple
fast-moving evasive targets under the Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of
Multiple Moving Targets framework. To this end, we use a decentralized search
and tracking strategy with adjustable levels of exploration and exploitation.
By indirectly tuning the balance, we first confirm the presence of an optimal
balance between these two key competing actions. Next, by substituting slower
moving agents with faster ones, we show that the system exhibits a performance
improvement without any modifications to the original strategy. In addition,
owing to the additional amount of exploitation carried out by the faster
agents, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous system's performance can be further
improved by reducing an agent's level of connectivity, to favor the conduct of
exploratory actions. Furthermore, in studying the influence of the density of
swarming agents, we show that the addition of faster agents can counterbalance
a reduction in the overall number of agents while maintaining the level of

confirm with SPIRou measurements spanning 2.7 years that the candidate
super-Earth on a 233-day orbit around Barnard's star is an artifact due to a
combination of time-sampling and activity. The LBL analysis of the Proxima

three popular programming languages: MATLAB, C, and Java. UltimateKalman is a
slight simplification and slight generalization of an elegant Kalman filter and
smoother that was proposed in 1977 by Paige and Saunders. Their algorithm
appears to be numerically superior and more flexible than other Kalman filters
and smoothers, but curiously has never been implemented or used before.
UltimateKalman is flexible: it can easily handle time-dependent problems,
problems with state vectors whose dimensions vary from step to step, problems
with varying number of observations in different steps (or no observations at
all in some steps), and problems in which the expectation of the initial state
is unknown. The programming interface of UltimateKalman is broken into simple
building blocks that can be used to construct filters, single or multi-step
predictors, multi-step or whole-track smoothers, and combinations. The paper
describes the algorithm and its implementation as well as with a test suite of
examples and tests.

traditionally been addressed by the mismatch between the model and
numerical-relativity simulations. This is a measure of the overall agreement
between the two waveforms. However, the largest modelling error typically
appears in the strong-field merger regime and may affect subdominant signal
harmonics more strongly. These inaccuracies are often not well characterised by
the mismatch. We explore the use of a complementary, physically motivated tool
to investigate the accuracy of gravitational-wave harmonics in waveform models:
the remnant's recoil, or kick velocity. Asymmetric binary mergers produce
remnants with significant recoil, encoded by subtle imprints in the
gravitational-wave signal. The kick estimate is highly sensitive to the
intrinsic inaccuracies of the modelled gravitational-wave harmonics during the
strongly relativistic merger regime. Here we investigate the accuracy of the

NRHybSur3dq8 models are not consistent in their kick predictions. Our results
enable us to identify regions in the parameter space where the models require
further improvement and support the use of the kick estimate to investigate

be used to calibrate waveform models further, proposing the first steps towards
kick-based gravitational-wave tuning.

tasks. However, the limited discriminability of learned representation
manifests there is still plenty to go for making a stronger vision learner.
Towards this goal, we propose Contrastive Masked Autoencoders (CMAE), a new
self-supervised pre-training method for learning more comprehensive and capable
vision representations. By elaboratively unifying contrastive learning (CL) and
masked image model (MIM) through novel designs, CMAE leverages their respective
advantages and learns representations with both strong instance
discriminability and local perceptibility. Specifically, CMAE consists of two
branches where the online branch is an asymmetric encoder-decoder and the
target branch is a momentum updated encoder. During training, the online
encoder reconstructs original images from latent representations of masked
images to learn holistic features. The target encoder, fed with the full
images, enhances the feature discriminability via contrastive learning with its
online counterpart. To make CL compatible with MIM, CMAE introduces two new
components, i.e. pixel shift for generating plausible positive views and
feature decoder for complementing features of contrastive pairs. Thanks to
these novel designs, CMAE effectively improves the representation quality and
transfer performance over its MIM counterpart. CMAE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on highly competitive benchmarks of image
classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Notably, CMAE-Base
achieves $85.3\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and $52.5\%$ mIoU on ADE20k,

understand the respective role of the different classes of proteins in the
supramolecular structure of gluten and its link to the material properties, we
investigate here concentrated dispersions of gluten proteins in water with a
fixed total protein concentration but variable composition in gliadin and
glutenin. Linear viscoelasticity measurements show a gradual increase of the
viscosity of the samples as the glutenin mass content increases from 7 to 66%.
While the gliadin-rich samples are microphase-separated viscous fluids,
homogeneous and transparent pre-gel and gels are obtained with the replacement
of gliadin by glutenin. To unravel the flow properties of the gluten samples,
we perform shear start-up experiments at different shear-rates. In accordance
with the linear viscoelastic signature, three classes of behaviour are
evidenced depending on the protein composition. As samples get depleted in
gliadin and enriched in glutenin, distinctive features are measured: (i)
viscosity undershoot suggesting droplet elongation for microphase-separated
dispersions, (ii) stress overshoot and partial structural relaxation for
near-critical pre-gels, and (iii) strain hardening and flow instabilities of
gels. We discuss the experimental results by analogy with the behaviour of
model systems, including viscoelastic emulsions, branched polymer melts and
critical gels, and provide a consistent physical picture of the supramolecular

learn this stroke-to-primitive mapping end-to-end with a distance-transform
loss that is minimal when the original sketch is precisely reconstructed with

Solutions of this type are commonly referred to as temporal dissipative

of a prototypical example that -- analogous to traveling pulses in
reaction-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) -- the branching of
two-pulse TDSs from one-pulse TDSs with non-oscillating tails is organized by
codimension-two homoclinic bifurcation points of a real saddle equilibrium in a
corresponding traveling wave frame. We consider a generalization of Sandstede's
model (a prototypical model for studying codimension-two homoclinic bifurcation
points in ODEs) with an additional time-shift parameter, and use Auto07p and
DDE-BIFTOOL to compute numerically the unfolding of these bifurcation points in
the resulting DDE. We then interpret this model as the traveling wave equation
for TDSs in a DDE with large delay by exploiting the reappearance of periodic
solutions in DDEs. In doing so, we identify both the non-orientable resonant
homoclinic bifurcation and the orbit flip bifurcation of case $\mathbf{B}$ as
organizing centers for the existence of two-pulse TDSs in the DDE with large

auxiliary system bound the existence region of TDSs in the DDE with large

explain why using two examples, the first of which is one-dimensional and
scalar-valued with a non-convex constraint, and the second of which is
multidimensional and non-convex in a different way. The latter example

realize high-power energy transfer, high-rate data transfer, human safety, and
self-alignment simultaneously, mobile transmission channel (MTC) analysis under

we propose analytical models and simulation tools for reflector-assisted NLOS
transmission of RB-SLIPT, where transmission loss and accurate beam field
profile of NLOS MTC can be obtained with a receiver at arbitrary positions and
attitude angles. We establish analytical models relying on full diffraction
theory for beam propagation between tilted or off-axis planes. Then, we provide
three numerical methods (i.e., NUFFT-based, cubic interpolation-based, and
linear interpolation-based methods) in simulations. Moreover, to deal with the
contradiction between limited computing memory and high sampling requirements
for long-range transmission analysis, we propose a multi-hop sliding window
approach, which can reduce the sampling number by a factor of thousands.
Finally, numerical results demonstrate that RB-SLIPT can achieve $4$W charging
power and $12$bit/s/Hz data rate over $2$m distance in NLOS scenarios.

nonlocality that describes fully collective nonlocal correlations among all
experimental parties, can be observed when different distant parties each
locally measure a particle from a shared entangled many-particle state. For the
demonstration of GMN, the experimentally observed statistics are typically
postselected: Events for which some parties do not detect a particle must be
discarded. This coincidence postselection generally leads to the detection
loophole that invalidates a proper nonlocality demonstration. In this work, we
address how to close the detection loophole for a coincidence detection in
demonstrations of nonlocality and GMN. We first show that if the number of
detected particles is conserved, i.e., using ideal and noiseless experimental
devices, one can employ causal diagrams and the no-signalling principle to
prove that a coincidence postselection cannot create any detection loophole.
Furthermore, for realistic experimental devices with finite detection
efficiencies, we show how a general Bell inequality can be sharpened such that
its new version is still valid after a postselection of the measurement data.
In this case, there are threshold detection efficiencies that, if surpassed in
the experiment, lead to the possibility to demonstrate nonlocality and GMN
without opening the detection loophole. Our results imply that genuine
$N$-partite nonlocality can be generated from $N$ independent particle sources
even when allowing for non-ideal detectors.

nanomaterials, with widespread applications in optoelectronics, high resolution
microscopy, imaging and sensing, among others. With the current ability of
ultrathin noble metal film deposition down to a few monolayers in thickness,
there is a need for an analytical expression of the thickness dependent complex
dielectric function for predicting optical properties for arbitrary
thicknesses. The free and bound electron contributions to the dielectric
function are dealt with independently, since their influences affect separate
wavelengths ranges. The former is dealt within the Drude model framework for
large wavelengths with appropriately addressed damping constant and plasma
frequency parameters to account for thickness dependence. Applying our
previously developed method, we determine these parameters for specific film
thicknesses, based on refractive index experimental values for Ag and Au thin
films. Fitting separately each one of these parameters allowed us to find an
analytical expression for their dependence on arbitrary film thickness and
consequently for the free electron contribution. Concerning bound electrons, it
is seen that its contribution for small wavelengths is the same for all
analyzed thicknesses and may be set equal to the bulk bound contribution.
Taking all these facts into account, the complex dielectric function can be
rewritten analytically, in terms of the bulk dielectric function plus
corrective film thickness dependent terms. In particular, the fitting process
for the damping constant allows us to determine that the electron scattering at
the film boundary is mainly diffusive (inelastic) for both silver and gold thin
films. It is also shown that, in accordance with theoretical studies, plasma
frequency shows a red shift as the film thickness decreases.

have been found instrumental to account for imprecisely known, latent
functions. It is often the case that such functions may be directly or
indirectly evaluated, be it in static or in sequential settings. Here we focus
on situations where, rather than pointwise evaluations, evaluations of
prescribed linear operators at the function of interest are (sequentially)
assimilated. While working with operator data is increasingly encountered in
the practice of Gaussian process modelling, mathematical details of
conditioning and model updating in such settings are typically by-passed. Here
we address these questions by highlighting conditions under which Gaussian
process modelling coincides with endowing separable Banach spaces of functions
with Gaussian measures, and by leveraging existing results on the
disintegration of such measures with respect to operator data. Using recent
results on path properties of GPs and their connection to RKHS, we extend the
Gaussian process - Gaussian measure correspondence beyond the standard setting
of Gaussian random elements in the Banach space of continuous functions.
Turning then to the sequential settings, we revisit update formulae in the
Gaussian measure framework and establish equalities between final and
intermediate posterior mean functions and covariance operators. The latter
equalities appear as infinite-dimensional and discretization-independent

reactions named Neuroevolution of Artificial General Intelligence (NAGI), a
framework for low-level AGI. This method allows the evolutionary
complexification of a randomly-initialized spiking neural network with adaptive

with a proof of the fact that there cannot be feasible solutions better than
the one given (the ""negative"" information). We model negative information by
introducing the concept of ""norphisms"", as opposed to the positive information
of morphisms. A ""nategory"" is a category that has ""nom""-sets in addition to
hom-sets, and specifies the interaction between norphisms and morphisms. In
particular, we have composition rules of the form $\text{morphism} +
\text{norphism} \to \text{norphism}$. Norphisms do not compose by themselves;
rather, they use morphisms as catalysts. After providing several applied
examples, we connect nategories to enriched categtory theory. Specifically, we
prove that categories enriched in de Paiva's dialectica categories
$\mathbf{GC}$, in the case $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{Set}$ and equipped with a
modified monoidal product, define nategories which satisfy additional
regularity properties. This formalizes negative information categorically in a
way that makes negative and positive morphisms equal citizens.

While recent studies have obtained non-perturbative contributions to the
collisional broadening kernel $C(b_\bot)$ using lattice simulation of the
dimensionally reduced long-distance effective theory of QCD, Electrostatic QCD
(EQCD), so far all phenomenological calculations of jet quenching rely on
perturbative determinations of the collisional broadening kernel. By matching
the short-distance behavior of the lattice extracted EQCD broadening kernel, we
determine the fully matched QCD broadening kernel non-perturbatively. We
present results for the collisional broadening kernel in impact-parameter

them to determine the rates of medium induced radiation in infinite and finite
size QCD plasmas. By contrasting our results with leading and next-to-leading
order perturbative determinations as well as various approximations of the
splitting rates employed in the literature, we investigate the effect of the
non-peturbative determination of CQCD($q_\bot$) on medium-induced radiation

Demanding vanishing vacuum energy with supergravity corrections constrains the
structure of the superpotential and Kahler potential; there is superpotential

$||\hat{\Sigma}-\Sigma||$ of the sample covariance $\hat{\Sigma}$. In the
path-breaking work of Koltchinskii and Lounici [KL17a], the `zeroth-order'

Gaussian widths over spherical slices of the (standardized) $\Sigma$-ellipsoid,
playing the role of a first-order analogue to the zeroth-order characteristic
$r(\Sigma)$. As an immediate application of the first-order characterization,
we obtain a version of the Koltchinskii-Lounici bound with optimal constants.
In the more special context of spiked covariance models, our first-order
characterization reveals a new phase transition of $||\hat{\Sigma}-\Sigma||$

transitional behavior of $||\hat{\Sigma}||$. A similar phase transition is also

and Pb0.24Sn0.76Te (PST) are widely investigated for spintronic applications
because graphene's high carrier mobility and PST's topologically protected

monolayer graphene with PST and demonstrate a hybrid system with properties
enhanced relative to the constituent parts. Using magnetotransport
measurements, we find carrier mobilities up to 20,000 cm2/Vs and a
magnetoresistance approaching 100 percent, greater than either material prior
to stacking. We also establish that there are two distinct transport channels

can be explained using the polar catastrophe model, whereby a high mobility

special emphasis is placed on the jump condition for the axiom of entropy
inequality, thereby recovering the conventional result that stable phase
equilibrium coincides with continuity of temperature, pressure, and free
enthalpy across the phase boundary. Moreover, this jump condition leads to the
formulation of a constitutive relation for the phase transformation mass flux,
$-\left[\left[\frac{1}{T}\mathbf{q}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}^{\Gamma}/\left[\left[s\right]\right]$,
where $\left[\left[\frac{1}{T}\mathbf{q}\right]\right]\cdot\mathbf{n}^{\Gamma}$
is the jump in entropy flux normal to, and across the phase interface $\Gamma$,

relation implies that phase transformations must be accompanied by a jump in
temperature across the phase boundary. Encouraging agreement is found between
this formula and limited available experimental data. Further evidence is
needed to conclusively validate this proposed constitutive model. This
continuum framework is well suited for implementation in a computational

test-retest reliability and validated RCUA based on 40 participants using the
known group and known treatment. We also compared it with a discrete
self-report scale and continuous postexperiment video annotation (CUA). The
result demonstrated that most participants were able to output four distinct
levels of uncertainty, though high variability and errors were observed. Both
known group and known treatment proved good validity of the measure and RCUA
was moderately correlated with self-report uncertainty. Self-report surveys
showed that participants can continuously push the joystick and conduct
wayfinding tasks at the same time. A comparison between RCUA and CUA showed
that RCUA had a higher granularity but participants tended to overreport
uncertainty using RCUA.

palsy, we proposed an innovative non-intrusive approach using a pressure
sensing device to classify infant general movements (GMs). Here, we tested the
feasibility of using pressure data to differentiate typical GM patterns of the
''fidgety period'' (i.e., fidgety movements) vs. the ''pre-fidgety period''
(i.e., writhing movements). Participants (N = 45) were sampled from a
typically-developing infant cohort. Multi-modal sensor data, including pressure
data from a 32x32-grid pressure sensing mat with 1024 sensors, were
prospectively recorded for each infant in seven succeeding laboratory sessions
in biweekly intervals from 4-16 weeks of post-term age. For proof-of-concept,
1776 pressure data snippets, each 5s long, from the two targeted age periods
were taken for movement classification. Each snippet was pre-annotated based on
corresponding synchronised video data by human assessors as either fidgety
present (FM+) or absent (FM-). Multiple neural network architectures were
tested to distinguish the FM+ vs. FM- classes, including support vector
machines (SVM), feed-forward networks (FFNs), convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The CNN achieved the
highest average classification accuracy (81.4%) for classes FM+ vs. FM-.
Comparing the pros and cons of other methods aiming at automated GMA to the
pressure sensing approach, we concluded that the pressure sensing approach has
great potential for efficient large-scale motion data acquisition and sharing.
This will in return enable improvement of the approach that may prove scalable
for daily clinical application for evaluating infant neuromotor functions.

that the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture holds for the $n^\text{th}$ centered

into functional groups (clusters) based on the common inputs they receive; 2)
clusters may significantly differ from the classical definition of motor neuron
pools, such that they may span across muscles and/or involve only a portion of
a muscle; 3) clusters represent functional modules used by the central nervous

increased demands which might not be met by embedded devices. Constraining the
usage of memory in such cases is of paramount importance. It is important that
such code size improvements should not have a negative impact on the runtime.
Improving the execution time while optimizing for code size is a non-trivial
but a significant task. The ordering of standard optimization sequences in
modern compilers is fixed, and are heuristically created by the compiler domain
experts based on their expertise. However, this ordering is sub-optimal, and
does not generalize well across all the cases. We present a reinforcement
learning based solution to the phase ordering problem, where the ordering
improves both the execution time and code size. We propose two different
approaches to model the sequences: one by manual ordering, and other based on a
graph called Oz Dependence Graph (ODG). Our approach uses minimal data as
training set, and is integrated with LLVM. We show results on x86 and AArch64
architectures on the benchmarks from SPEC-CPU 2006, SPEC-CPU 2017 and MiBench.
We observe that the proposed model based on ODG outperforms the current Oz
sequence both in terms of size and execution time by 6.19% and 11.99% in SPEC
2017 benchmarks, on an average.

makes students prepared for future problem solving. Researchers have explored
subgoal labeled instructional materials with explanations in traditional
problem solving and within tutoring systems to help novices learn to subgoal.
However, only a little research is found on problem-solving strategies in
relationship with subgoal learning. Also, these strategies are under-explored
within computer-based tutors and learning environments. Backward
problem-solving strategy is closely related to the process of subgoaling, where
problem solving iteratively refines the goal into a new subgoal to reduce
difficulty. In this paper, we explore a training strategy for backward strategy
learning within an intelligent logic tutor that teaches logic proof
construction. The training session involved backward worked examples (BWE) and
problem-solving (BPS) to help students learn backward strategy towards
improving their subgoaling and problem-solving skills. To evaluate the training
strategy, we analyzed students' 1) experience with and engagement in learning
backward strategy, 2) performance, and 3) proof construction approaches in new
problems that they solved independently without tutor help after each level of
training and in post-test. Our results showed that, when new problems were
given to solve without any tutor help, students who were trained with both BWE
and BPS outperformed students who received none of the treatment or only BWE
during training. Additionally, students trained with both BWE and BPS derived
subgoals during proof construction with significantly higher efficiency than
the other two groups.

absence of a human tutor. Prior evaluations showed that these systems improve
learning in terms of test scores, or task completion efficiency. However,
crucial aspects which can impact learning or reveal insights important for
future improvement of such systems are ignored in these evaluations. These
aspects include inherent fallibility of current state-of-the-art, students'
programming behavior in response to correct/incorrect feedback, and
effective/ineffective system components. Consequently, a great deal of
knowledge is yet to be discovered about such systems. In this paper, we apply a
multi-criteria evaluation with 5 criteria on a data-driven feedback system
integrated within a block-based novice programming environment. Each criterion
in the evaluation reveals a unique pivotal aspect of the system: 1) How
accurate the feedback system is; 2) How it guides students throughout
programming tasks; 3) How it helps students in task completion; 4) What happens
when it goes wrong; and 5) How students respond generally to the system. Our
evaluation results showed that the system was helpful to students due to its
effective design and feedback representation despite being fallible. However,
novices can be negatively impacted by this fallibility due to high reliance and
lack of self-evaluation. The negative impacts include increased working time,
implementation, or submission of incorrect/partially correct solutions. The
evaluation results reinforced the necessity of multi-criteria system
evaluations while revealing important insights helpful to ensuring proper usage
of data-driven feedback systems, designing fallibility mitigation steps, and
driving research for future improvement.

the synchronization when the system is affected by stochastic disturbances. We
model the disturbances by Gaussian noise and use the mean first hitting time
when the state hits the boundary of a secure domain, that is a subset of the
basin of the attraction, to measure the synchronization stability. Based on the
invariant probability distribution of a system of phase oscillators subject to
Gaussian disturbances, we propose an optimization method to increase the mean
first hitting time, and thus increase the synchronization stability. In this
method, a new metric for the synchronization stability is defined as the
probability of the state being absent from the secure domain, which reflects
the impact of all the system parameters and the strength of the disturbances.
Furthermore, by this new metric, one may identify those edges which may lead to
desynchronization with a high risk. A case study shows that the mean first
hitting time is dramatically increased after solving the corresponding
optimization problems and the vulnerable edges are effectively identified. It
is also found that optimizing the synchronization by maximizing the order
