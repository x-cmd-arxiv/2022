spent by a quantum mechanical particle or a photon to tunnel through an opaque
potential barrier becomes independent of barrier width for long barriers. Such
an effect, which has been observed in different physical settings, raised a
lively debate and some controversies, owing to the correct definition and
interpretation of tunneling times and the apparent superluminal transmission. A
rather open question is whether (and under which conditions) the Hartman effect
persists for inelastic scattering, i.e. when the potential becomes
non-Hermitian and the scattering matrix is not unitary. Here we consider
tunneling through a heterojunction barrier in the tight-binding picture, where
the barrier consists of a generally non-Hermitian finite-sized lattice attached
to two semi-infinite nearest-neighbor Hermitian lattice leads. We derive a
simple and general condition for the persistence of the Hartman effect in
non-Hermitian barriers, showing that it can be found rather generally when
non-Hermiticity arises from non-reciprocal couplings, i.e. when the barrier
displays the non-Hermitian skin effect, without any special symmetry in the
system.

performance applications and (2) parallel algorithms for the 3D simulation of
strongly nonlinear processes as mechanical and reactive porosity waves. To
simulate mechanical porosity waves we employ a massively parallel algorithm
that permits to resolve the deformation of fluid-filled viscoelastic porous
media in 3D. The utilized mathematical model is based on Biot's poroelastic
theory, extended to account for viscous deformation and plastic yielding. The
modelling results exhibit the impact of decompaction weakening on the formation
of three-dimensional solitary-wave-like moving porosity channels. To simulate
reactive porosity waves we use a solver for 3D deformation of fluid-filled
reactive viscous porous media. The Damk\""ohler number (Da) of the simulations
is varied in order to estimate the respective roles of viscous deformation (low
Da) and reaction (high Da) on wave propagation. 3D waves are found to propagate
independently of their source at constant speed by going through each other for
all the investigated Da. Soliton-like wave propagation as a result of
metamorphic reaction provides an efficient mechanism for fluid flow in the
Earth's crust. We illustrate the great performance and versatility of HPC.m by
deploying it to generate solvers for a variety of physics across multiple Earth
Science disciplines. All solvers run close to hardware's peak performance and
were shown to scale linearly on a institute cluster with 80 GPUs. Moreover, our
nonlinear poroviscoelastic two-phase flow solver scales close to ideally on Piz

the ISM based on optical observations have been widely spread over decades for
SFG and, more recently, for AGN, similar studies need to be performed using IR
data. This regime can be especially useful in the case of AGN given that it is
less affected by temperature and dust extinction, traces higher ionic species
and can also provide robust estimations of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. We
present a new tool based on a bayesian-like methodology to estimate chemical
abundances from IR emission lines in AGN. We use a sample of 58 AGN with IR
spectroscopic data retrieved from the literature to probe the validity of our
method. The estimations of the chemical abundances based on IR lines in our
sample are later compared with the corresponding abundances derived from the
optical emission lines in the same objects. HII-CHI-Mistry-IR takes advantage
of photoionization models, characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H
and N/O and the ionization parameter $U$, to compare their predicted
emission-line fluxes with a set of observed values. Instead of matching single
emission lines, the code uses some specific emission-line ratios sensitive to
the above free parameters. We report mainly solar and also subsolar abundances
for O/H in the nuclear region for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters
around solar values. We find a discrepancy between the chemical abundances
derived from IR and optical emission lines, being the latter higher than the
former. This discrepancy, also reported by previous studies of the composition
of the ISM in AGN from IR observations, is independent from the gas density or
the incident radiation field to the gas.

via dynamic interaction with the environment. Here, due to the specifics of the
application, it is not generally possible to perform long pre-training, as it
is commonly done in off-line, model-free approaches, which are akin to dynamic
programming. Such applications may be found more frequently in industry, rather
than in pure digital fields, such as cloud services, video games, database
management, etc., where reinforcement learning has been demonstrating success.
Online reinforcement learning, in contrast, is more akin to classical control,
which utilizes some model knowledge about the environment. Stability of the
closed-loop (agent plus the environment) is a major challenge for such online
approaches. In this paper, we tackle this problem by a special fusion of online
reinforcement learning with elements of classical control, namely, based on the
Lyapunov theory of stability. The idea is to start the agent at once, without
pre-training, and learn approximately optimal policy under specially designed
constraints, which guarantee stability. The resulting approach was tested in an
extensive experimental study with a mobile robot. A nominal parking controller
was used as a baseline. It was observed that the suggested agent could always
successfully park the robot, while significantly improving the cost. While many
approaches may be exploited for mobile robot control, we suggest that the
experiments showed the promising potential of online reinforcement learning
agents based on Lyapunov-like constraints. The presented methodology may be
utilized in safety-critical, industrial applications where stability is
necessary.

  Traditional Chinese Medicine","25 pages, 4 figures plus 1 table",,,,"q-bio.MN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) relies on natural medical products to
treat symptoms and diseases. While clinical data have demonstrated the
effectiveness of selected TCM-based treatments, the mechanistic root of how TCM
herbs treat diseases remains largely unknown. More importantly, current
approaches focus on single herbs or prescriptions, missing the high-level
general principles of TCM. To uncover the mechanistic nature of TCM on a system
level, in this work we establish a generic network medicine framework for TCM
from the human protein interactome. Applying our framework reveals a network
pattern between symptoms (diseases) and herbs in TCM. We first observe that
genes associated with a symptom are not distributed randomly in the
interactome, but cluster into localized modules; furthermore, a short network
distance between two symptom modules is indicative of the symptoms'
co-occurrence and similarity. Next, we show that the network proximity of a
herb's targets to a symptom module is predictive of the herb's effectiveness in
treating the symptom. We validate our framework with real-world hospital
patient data by showing that (1) shorter network distance between symptoms of
inpatients correlates with higher relative risk (co-occurrence), and (2)
herb-symptom network proximity is indicative of patients' symptom recovery rate
after herbal treatment. Finally, we identified novel herb-symptom pairs in
which the herb's effectiveness in treating the symptom is predicted by network
and confirmed in hospital data, but previously unknown to the TCM community.
These predictions highlight our framework's potential in creating herb
discovery or repurposing opportunities. In conclusion, network medicine offers
a powerful novel platform to understand the mechanism of traditional medicine
and to predict novel herbal treatment against diseases.

vastly discussed in the literature, little attention has been given to the
robustness of such centralised implementation, such as the provision of
redundant control solutions during a communication failure. This paper aims to
implement a machine learning-based algorithm at each Intelligent Electronic
Device (IED) that mimics the centralised OPF used during communication failures
using IEC 61850 data models. Under normal circumstances, the IEDs communicate
for centralised OPF. In addition, the system is trained offline for all
operational conditions and the individual look-up tables linking the actual
voltages to the DER setpoints are sent to the respective controllers. The
regression models allow for the local reconstruction of the DER setpoints,
emulating the overall OPF, in case of a communication failure. In addition to
the regression control, the paper also explains an offline learning approach
for periodic re-training of the regression models. The implementation is
experimentally verified using a Hardware-in-the-loop test setup. The tests
showed promising results compared to conventional control strategies during
communication failures. When properly trained and coordinated, such an
intuitive local control approach for each DER could be very beneficial for the
bulk power system. This machine learning-based approach could also replace the
existing Q(V) control strategies, to better support the bulk power system.

designed various pooling variants in spatial domain to handle these limitations
with much progress, the temporal aspect is rarely visited where directly
applying hand-crafted methods or these specialized spatial variants may not be
optimal. In this paper, we derive temporal lift pooling (TLP) from the Lifting
Scheme in signal processing to intelligently downsample features of different
temporal hierarchies. The Lifting Scheme factorizes input signals into various
sub-bands with different frequency, which can be viewed as different temporal
movement patterns. Our TLP is a three-stage procedure, which performs signal

downsized feature map. We select a typical temporal task with long sequences,

effectiveness of TLP. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show TLP
outperforms hand-crafted methods and specialized spatial variants by a large

on one domain to a new domain using one reference image only. However, it
remains very challenging for the adapted generator (i) to generate diverse
images inherited from the pre-trained generator while (ii) faithfully acquiring
the domain-specific attributes and styles of the reference image. In this
paper, we present a novel one-shot generative domain adaption method, i.e.,
DiFa, for diverse generation and faithful adaptation. For global-level
adaptation, we leverage the difference between the CLIP embedding of reference
image and the mean embedding of source images to constrain the target
generator. For local-level adaptation, we introduce an attentive style loss
which aligns each intermediate token of adapted image with its corresponding
token of the reference image. To facilitate diverse generation, selective
cross-domain consistency is introduced to select and retain the domain-sharing
attributes in the editing latent $\mathcal{W}+$ space to inherit the diversity
of pre-trained generator. Extensive experiments show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-arts both quantitatively and qualitatively,
especially for the cases of large domain gaps. Moreover, our DiFa can easily be
extended to zero-shot generative domain adaption with appealing results. Code

  Split for Massive MIMO","13 pages, 11 figures, submitted to IEEE journal",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has attracted tremendous
attention for the future 6G wireless communication systems. To improve the
transmission rates and sensing accuracy, massive multi-input multi-output
(MIMO) technique is leveraged with large transmission bandwidth. However, the
growing size of transmission bandwidth and antenna array results in the beam
squint effect, which hampers the communications. Moreover, the time overhead of
the traditional sensing algorithm is prohibitive for practical systems. In this
paper, instead of alleviating the wideband beam squint effect, we take
advantage of joint beam squint and beam split effect and propose a novel user
directions sensing method integrated with massive MIMO orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, with the beam squint
effect, the BS utilizes the true-time-delay (TTD) lines to steer the beams of
different OFDM subcarriers towards different directions simultaneously. The
users feedback the subcarrier frequency with the maximum array gain to the BS.
Then, the BS calculates the direction based on the subcarrier frequency
feedback. Futhermore, the beam split effect introduced by enlarging the
inter-antenna spacing is exploited to expand the sensing range. The proposed
sensing method operates over frequency-domain, and the intended sensing range
is covered by all the subcarriers simultaneously, which reduces the time
overhead of the conventional sensing significantly. Simulation results have
demonstrated the effectiveness as well as the superior performance of the
proposed ISAC scheme.

the language biases. Current mainstream DA strategies are synthetic-based
methods, which synthesize new samples by either editing some visual
regions/words, or re-generating them from scratch. However, these synthetic
samples are always unnatural and error-prone. To avoid this issue, a recent DA
work composes new augmented samples by randomly pairing pristine images and
other human-written questions. Unfortunately, to guarantee augmented samples
have reasonable ground-truth answers, they manually design a set of heuristic
rules for several question types, which extremely limits its generalization
abilities. To this end, we propose a new Knowledge Distillation based Data
Augmentation for VQA, dubbed KDDAug. Specifically, we first relax the
requirements of reasonable image-question pairs, which can be easily applied to
any question types. Then, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) based answer
assignment to generate pseudo answers for all composed image-question pairs,
which are robust to both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Since
KDDAug is a model-agnostic DA strategy, it can be seamlessly incorporated into
any VQA architectures. Extensive ablation studies on multiple backbones and

KDDAug.

powerful model systems for deciphering the behavior of real molecules and
building units for creating materials with designed properties. While many
strategies for their assembly have been developed, they typically yield a broad
distribution or are limited to a specific type. We hypothesize that the shape
and relative sizes of colloidal particles can be exploited to efficiently
direct their assembly into colloidal molecules of desired valence.
  Experiments: We exploit electrostatic self-assembly of negatively charged
spheres made from either polystyrene or silica onto positively charged hematite
cubes. We thoroughly analyze the role of the shape and size ratio of particles
on the cluster size and yield of colloidal molecules.
  Findings: Using a combination of experiments and simulations, we demonstrate
that cubic particle shape is crucial to generate high yields of distinct
colloidal molecules over a wide variety of size ratios. We find that
electrostatic repulsion between the satellite spheres is important to leverage
the templating effect of the cubes, leading the spheres to preferentially
assemble on the facets rather than the edges and corners of the cube.
Furthermore, we reveal that our protocol is not affected by the specific choice
of the material of the colloidal particles. Finally, we show that the permanent
magnetic dipole moment of the hematite cubes can be utilized to separate
colloidal molecules from non-assembled satellite particles. Our simple and
effective strategy might be extended to other templating particle shapes,
thereby greatly expanding the library of colloidal molecules that can be
achieved with high yield and purity.

elasticity functionals is paramount to understanding and controlling the

solve this problem for a wide array of well-known origami tessellations

universal properties. On one hand, they all admit equal but opposite in-plane

detaches from their in-plane strain and depends instead on the strain gradient.

simulations, we explore in detail the conditions where nucleation of cubic
diamond from tetrahedral building blocks is favored. In particular, we focus on
the effect of depletion and DNA-mediated interactions to form and stabilize
this cubic diamond crystal. We find that a particular balance between the
strength and range of the depletion interactions enhances the self-assembly of
stable cubic diamond, leading to a narrow region where this structure is
nucleated. Moreover, we determine that stronger short-range depletion
attractions may arrest the system leading to the formation of percolating
diamond networks or fully disordered gel structures. Accordingly, the internal
arrangements of these structures exhibit a distinct variation in terms of
fractal dimension and the presence of six-membered rings that increasingly
acquire internal strain as the arrest gets more pronounced. With these results
we provide a clear route for the self-assembly of cubic colloidal diamond,
towards the realization of crystals with superior photonic properties.

$\sim$~0.001 -- 30~au.
  Aims: We have surveyed pulsars for scintillation arcs in a relatively
unbiased sample with DM < 100 pc cm-3. We present multi-frequency observations
of 22 low to moderate DM pulsars. Many of the 54 observations were also
observed at another frequency within a few days.
  Methods: For all observations we present dynamic spectra, autocorrelation
functions, and secondary spectra. We analyze these data products to obtain
scintillation bandwidths, pulse broadening times, and arc curvatures.
  Results: We detect definite or probable scintillation arcs in 19 of the 22
pulsars and 34 of the 54 observations, showing that scintillation arcs are a
prevalent phenomenon. The arcs are better defined in low DM pulsars. We show
that well-defined arcs do not directly imply anisotropy of scattering. Only the
presence of reverse arclets and a deep valley along the delay axis, which
occurs in about 20\% of the pulsars in the sample, indicates substantial
anisotropy of scattering.
  Conclusions: The survey demonstrates substantial patchiness of the ionized
ISM on both au size scales transverse to the line of sight and on $\sim$~100~pc
scales along it. We see little evidence for distributed scattering along most
lines of sight in the survey.

systematic and comprehensive review of rank-based decomposable losses in
machine learning. Specifically, we provide a new taxonomy of loss functions

Bilinear stability introduces norms to the mix: The growth factor of the

larger growth factors correlate with less accurate results. Compared to similar
studies of numerical stability, bilinear stability is more general, applying to
any bilinear operators and not just matrix or complex multiplications; is more

our boosting works in the past years. In particular, the package includes
mainly three lines of techniques, among which the following two are already the
standard implementations in popular boosted tree platforms:
  (i) The histogram-based (feature-binning) approach makes the tree
implementation convenient and efficient. In Li et al (2007), a simple
fixed-length adaptive binning algorithm was developed. In this report, we
demonstrate that such a simple algorithm is still surprisingly effective
compared to more sophisticated variants in popular tree platforms.
  (ii) The explicit gain formula in Li (20010) for tree splitting based on
second-order derivatives of the loss function typically improves, often
considerably, over the first-order methods. Although the gain formula in Li
(2010) was derived for logistic regression loss, it is a generic formula for
loss functions with second-derivatives. For example, the open-source package
also includes $L_p$ regression for $p\geq 1$.
  The main contribution of this package is the ABC-Boost (adaptive base class
boosting) for multi-class classification. The initial work in Li (2008) derived
a new set of derivatives of the classical multi-class logistic regression by
specifying a ""base class"". The accuracy can be substantially improved if the
base class is chosen properly. The major technical challenge is to design a
search strategy to select the base class. The prior published works implemented
an exhaustive search procedure to find the base class which is computationally
too expensive. Recently, a new report (Li and Zhao, 20022) presents a unified
framework of ""Fast ABC-Boost"" which allows users to efficiently choose the
proper search space for the base class.

demonstrates that these devices can work as Josephson diodes, with
dissipation-less current flowing in only one direction. For small fields, the
supercurrent asymmetry increases linearly with the external field, then it
saturates as the Zeeman energy becomes relevant, before it finally decreases to
zero at higher fields. We show that the effect is maximum when the in-plane

Unfortunately, to date there have been no concrete technical proposals to

show platform-supported auditing need not risk user privacy nor disclosure of

Finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signal model, which is ubiquitous in many
applications, can be used to reduce the sampling rate. In the context of modulo
folding for FRI sampling, existing works operate at a very high sampling rate
compared to the rate of innovation (RoI) and require a large number of samples
compared to the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the FRI signal. Moreover, these
approaches use infinite length filters that are practically infeasible. We
consider the FRI sampling problem with a compactly supported kernel under the

of each type of galactic component. To perform this kind of analysis, is
necessary to define some criteria to separate those components. Decomposition
methods based on dynamical properties are more physically motivated than
photometry-based ones. We use the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture model of
\texttt{galactic structure finder} to extract the components of a sub-sample of
galaxies with Milky Way-like masses from the EAGLE simulations. A clustering in
the space of first and second order dynamical moments of all identified
substructures reveals five types of galaxy components: thin and thick disks,
stellar halos, bulges and spheroids. We analyse the dynamical, morphological
and stellar population properties of these five component types, exploring to
what extent these properties correlate with each other, and how much they
depend on the total galaxy stellar and dark matter halo masses. All galaxies
contain a bulge, a stellar halo and a disk. 60% of objects host two disks (thin
and thick), and 68% host also a spheroid. The dynamical disk-to-total ratio
does not depend on stellar mass, but the median rotational velocities of the
two disks do. Thin disks are well separated in stellar ages, [Fe/H] and
$\alpha$-enhancement from the three dispersion-dominated components, while
thick disks are in between. Except for thin disks, all components show
correlations among their stellar population properties: older ages mean lower
metallicities and larger $\alpha$-enhancement. Finally, we quantify the weak
dependence of stellar population properties on each component's dynamics.

an extensional normalisation result. In the second part of the paper the
analysis is refined further by considering intensional Kripke relations (in the
form of Artin glueing) and shown to provide a function for normalising terms,
casting normalisation by evaluation in the context of categorical glueing. The
technical development includes an algebraic treatment of the syntax and
semantics of the typed lambda calculus that allows the definition of the
normalisation function to be given within a simply typed metatheory. A
normalisation-by-evaluation program in a dependently-typed functional

high-SNR emission line detections, with 5 objects at $1 < z < 3$ displaying

5 higher-redshift galaxies we extract fluxes in 6 NIRCam bands spanning
$\lambda_\mathrm{obs}=0.8-5\mu$m and perform spectral energy distribution

exhibit a U-shaped pattern across the F277W, F356W and F444W bands, indicating
a Balmer break seen in emission (Balmer jump) and high-equivalent-width

measure average error rates or process infidelities. However, thresholds for
fault-tolerant quantum error correction are given in terms of worst-case error
rates -- defined via the diamond norm -- which can differ from average error
rates by orders of magnitude. One method for resolving this discrepancy is to
randomize the physical implementation of quantum gates, using techniques like
randomized compiling (RC). In this work, we use gate set tomography to perform
precision characterization of a set of two-qubit logic gates to study RC on a
superconducting quantum processor. We find that, under RC, gate errors are
accurately described by a stochastic Pauli noise model without coherent errors,
and that spatially-correlated coherent errors and non-Markovian errors are
strongly suppressed. We further show that the average and worst-case error
rates are equal for randomly compiled gates, and measure a maximum worst-case
error of 0.0197(3) for our gate set. Our results show that randomized
benchmarks are a viable route to both verifying that a quantum processor's
error rates are below a fault-tolerance threshold, and to bounding the failure
rates of near-term algorithms, if -- and only if -- gates are implemented via
randomization methods which tailor noise.

While there are some accounts of how these resources modulate statistical

model training. This work conducts such an exploration through the lens of
learning a $k$-sparse parity of $n$ bits, a canonical discrete search problem
which is statistically easy but computationally hard. Empirically, we find that
a variety of neural networks successfully learn sparse parities, with
discontinuous phase transitions in the training curves. On small instances,
learning abruptly occurs at approximately $n^{O(k)}$ iterations; this nearly
matches SQ lower bounds, despite the apparent lack of a sparse prior. Our
theoretical analysis shows that these observations are not explained by a
Langevin-like mechanism, whereby SGD ""stumbles in the dark"" until it finds the
hidden set of features (a natural algorithm which also runs in $n^{O(k)}$
time). Instead, we show that SGD gradually amplifies the sparse solution via a
Fourier gap in the population gradient, making continual progress that is
invisible to loss and error metrics.

it takes $\widetilde{\Theta}(d/\varepsilon)$ applications of the unitaries to

are close to optimal. In particular, we show that a trace-norm ($q=1$) estimate
can be obtained with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dr/\varepsilon)$ queries. This
improves (assuming our stronger input model) the $\varepsilon$-dependence over
the algorithm of Haah et al.\ (2017) that uses a joint measurement on
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dr/\varepsilon^2)$ copies of the state. To our
knowledge, the most sample-efficient results for pure-state tomography come
from setting the rank to $1$ in generic mixed-state tomography algorithms,
which can be computationally demanding. We describe sample-optimal algorithms
for pure states that are easy and fast to implement. Along the way we show that
an $\ell_\infty$-norm estimate of a normalized vector induces a (slightly
worse) $\ell_q$-norm estimate for that vector, without losing a
dimension-dependent factor in the precision. We also develop an unbiased and
symmetric version of phase estimation, where the probability distribution of

interstellar medium (ISM) because they are incorporated into dust grains, a
phenomenon called dust depletion. The study of dust depletion in the ISM is
important to investigate the origin and evolution of metals and cosmic dust.
Here we aim at characterizing the dust depletion of several metals from the
Milky Way to distant galaxies. We collect ISM metal column densities from
absorption-line spectroscopy in the literature, and in addition, we determine
Ti and Ni column densities from a sample of 70 damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers
(DLAs) towards quasars, observed with UVES/VLT. We use ISM relative abundances
to estimate the dust depletion of 18 metals (C, P, O, Cl, Kr, S, Ge, Mg, Si,
Cu, Co, Mn, Cr, Ni, Al, Ti, Zn and Fe) for different environments (the Milky
Way, the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), DLAs towards quasars and towards gamma-ray
bursts). We observe linear relations between the depletion of each metal and
the strength of dust depletion, which we trace with the observed [Zn/Fe]. In
the neutral ISM of the MCs we find small deviations from linearity observed as
an overabundance of the $\alpha$-elements Ti, Mg, S and an underabundance of
Mn. The deviations disappear if we assume that all OB stars observed towards
the MCs in our sample have an $\alpha$-element enhancement and Mn
underabundance. This may imply that the MCs have been recently enriched in
$\alpha$-elements, potentially due to recent bursts of star formation. The
observed strong correlations of the depletion sequences of the metals all the
way from low metallicity QSO-DLAs to the Milky Way suggest that cosmic dust has
a common origin, independently of the star formation history, which varies
significantly between these different galaxies. This supports the importance of
grain growth in the ISM as a significant process of dust production.

it incurs polynomially long time overhead. To address these problems, we here

location of CN and CO isotopologues in Elias 2-27 is layered and consistent
with predictions from thermochemical models. A north/south asymmetry in the
radial extent of CN is detected and we find that the CN emission is mostly
optically thin and constrained vertically to a thin slab at $z/r \sim$0.5. A
column density of 10$^{14}$\,cm$^{-2}$ is measured in the inner disk which for
the north side decreases to 10$^{12}$\,cm$^{-2}$ and for the south side to
10$^{13}$\,cm$^{-2}$ in the outer regions. In Elias 2-27, CN traces a
vertically elevated region above the midplane, very similar to that traced by

orbits that are inconsistent with these measurements, we constructed a function
that estimates the probability of each of the Gaia orbits to be correct, using
the published robust parameters. We devise a clean but still very large Gaia
SB1 sample of 91740 orbits. The sample differs from the parent sample by the
absence of - physically unlikely and hence presumably spurious - short-period
binaries with high eccentricity. The clean SB1 sample offers the prospect of
thorough statistical studies of the binary population after carefully modeling
of the remaining selection effects. At a first look, two possible features
emerge from the clean sample - a paucity of short-period binaries with low-mass
primaries, which might be a result of some observational bias, and a sub-sample
of main-sequence binaries on circular orbits, probable evidence for
circularization processes.

of a sample of star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0.75-1.45$, to probe the
baryonic composition of galaxies in and during the epoch of peak star-formation
activity in the universe. The $\langle M_{Atom}\rangle$ values of star-forming
galaxies in two stellar-mass matched samples at $z=0.74-1.25$ and
$z=1.25-1.45$, were derived by stacking their HI 21cm signals in the
GMRT-CAT$z1$ survey. We find that the baryonic composition of star-forming
galaxies at $z\gtrsim 1$ is dramatically different from that at $z\approx0$.
For star-forming galaxies with $\langle M_*\rangle\approx10^{10} M_\odot$, the
contribution of stars to the total baryonic mass, $M_{Baryon}$, is
$\approx61\%$ at $z\approx0$, but only $\approx16\%$ at $z\approx1.3$, while
molecular gas constitutes $\approx6\%$ of the baryonic mass at $z\approx0$, and
$\approx14\%$ at $z\approx1.3$. Remarkably, we find that atomic gas makes up
$\approx70\%$ of $M_{Baryon}$ in star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1.3$. We
find that the ratio $\langle M_{Atom}\rangle/\langle M_*\rangle$ is higher both
at $z\approx1.0$ and at $z\approx1.3$ than in the local Universe, with $\langle
M_{Atom}\rangle/\langle M_*\rangle\approx1.4$ at $z\approx1.0$, and
$\approx4.4$ at $z\approx1.3$, compared to its value of $\approx0.5$ today.
Further, we find that the ratio $\langle M_{Atom}\rangle/\langle
M_{Mol}\rangle$ in star-forming galaxies with $\langle M_*\rangle
\approx10^{10} M_\odot$ is $\approx2.3$ at $z\approx1.0$ and $\approx5.0$ at

the baryonic mass of star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1.3$, during the epoch

the population synthesis code SeBa to simulate the evolution of massive

the mass transfer efficiency and the angular momentum loss during the first

with radiative envelopes, 4) the effective temperature at which an evolved star
develops a deep convective envelope, and 5) the stellar winds. Our varied

GW sources. Most notably, the impact of the mass transfer stability criteria
parameter depends on the assumed mass transfer efficiency. The uncertainties in
the assumed angular momentum loss have significant effects on the relative

lack of reliable models direct inference of massive binary physics from

Fermi Bubbles, extending ~10 kpc both above and below the Galactic plane.
Spectroscopic observations of Fermi Bubble directions at radio, ultraviolet,
and optical wavelengths have detected multi-phase gas clouds thought to be
embedded within the bubbles referred to as Fermi Bubble high-velocity clouds
(FB HVCs). While these clouds have kinematics that can be modeled by a
biconical nuclear wind launched from the Galactic center, their exact origin is
unknown because, until now, there has been little information on their
heavy-metal abundance (metallicity). Here we show that FB HVCs have a wide
range of metallicities from <20% solar to ~320% solar. This result is based on
the first metallicity survey of FB HVCs. These metallicities challenge the
previously accepted tenet that all FB HVCs are launched from the Galactic
center into the Fermi Bubbles with solar or super-solar metallicities. Instead,
we suggest that FB HVCs originate in both the Milky Way's disk and halo. As
such, some of these clouds may characterize circumgalactic medium that the
Fermi Bubbles expand into, rather than material carried outward by the nuclear
wind, changing the canonical picture of FB HVCs. More broadly, these results
reveal that nuclear outflows from spiral galaxies can operate by sweeping up
gas in their halos while simultaneously removing gas from their disks.

universal horizon. By working in the tunneling picture for a gravitating scalar
field, we show that universal horizons emit Hawking radiation in a manner akin
to standard results in General Relativity, with a temperature controlled by the
high-energy behavior of the dispersion relation of the gravitating field, and
in agreement with alternative derivations in the literature. Our results
substantiate the link between the universal horizon and thermodynamics in
Lorentz violating theories.

  in Multiple Dimensions?",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111882",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since proposed in [X. Zhang and C.-W. Shu, J. Comput. Phys., 229: 3091--3120,
2010], the Zhang--Shu framework has attracted extensive attention and motivated
many bound-preserving (BP) high-order discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume
schemes for various hyperbolic equations. A key ingredient in the framework is
the decomposition of the cell averages of the numerical solution into a convex
combination of the solution values at certain quadrature points, which helps to
rewrite high-order schemes as convex combinations of formally first-order
schemes. The classic convex decomposition originally proposed by Zhang and Shu
has been widely used over the past decade. It was verified, only for the 1D
quadratic and cubic polynomial spaces, that the classic decomposition is
optimal in the sense of achieving the mildest BP CFL condition. Yet, it
remained unclear whether the classic decomposition is optimal in multiple
dimensions. In this paper, we find that the classic multidimensional
decomposition based on the tensor product of Gauss--Lobatto and Gauss
quadratures is generally not optimal, and we discover a novel alternative
decomposition for the 2D and 3D polynomial spaces of total degree up to 2 and
3, respectively, on Cartesian meshes. Our new decomposition allows a larger BP
time step-size than the classic one, and moreover, it is rigorously proved to
be optimal to attain the mildest BP CFL condition, yet requires much fewer
nodes. The discovery of such an optimal convex decomposition is highly
nontrivial yet meaningful, as it may lead to an improvement of high-order BP
schemes for a large class of hyperbolic or convection-dominated equations, at
the cost of only a slight and local modification to the implementation code.
Several numerical examples are provided to further validate the advantages of
using our optimal decomposition over the classic one in terms of efficiency.

particles trapped in turbulent ring-like gas pressure bumps. This major
paradigm shift also challenges the leading theory of planetesimal formation
from such pebbles by the streaming instability, which operates in a pressure
gradient and can be suppressed by turbulence. Here we conduct three-dimensional
local shearing-box, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of dust
trapping in enforced gas pressure bumps including dust backreaction. Under the
moderate level of turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) with ambipolar diffusion that is suitable for outer disk conditions, we
achieve quasi-steady states of dust trapping balanced by turbulent diffusion.
We find strong dust clumping in all simulations near the gas pressure maxima,
reaching a maximum density well above the threshold of triggering gravitational
collapse to form planetesimals. A strong pressure bump concentrates dust
particles towards bump center. With a weak pressure bump, dust can also
concentrate in secondary filaments off the bump center due to dust
backreaction, but strong clumping still occurs mainly in the primary ring
around the bump center. Our results reveal dust-trapping rings as robust
locations for planetesimal formation in outer PPDs, while they may possess
diverse observational properties.

standard adversarial training (SAT). However, initial FAT encounters
catastrophic overfitting, i.e.,the robust accuracy against adversarial attacks
suddenly and dramatically decreases. Though several FAT variants spare no
effort to prevent overfitting, they sacrifice much calculation cost. In this
paper, we explore the difference between the training processes of SAT and FAT
and observe that the attack success rate of adversarial examples (AEs) of FAT
gets worse gradually in the late training stage, resulting in overfitting. The
AEs are generated by the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) with a zero or random
initialization. Based on the observation, we propose a prior-guided FGSM
initialization method to avoid overfitting after investigating several
initialization strategies, improving the quality of the AEs during the whole
training process. The initialization is formed by leveraging historically
generated AEs without additional calculation cost. We further provide a
theoretical analysis for the proposed initialization method. We also propose a
simple yet effective regularizer based on the prior-guided initialization,i.e.,
the currently generated perturbation should not deviate too much from the
prior-guided initialization. The regularizer adopts both historical and current
adversarial perturbations to guide the model learning. Evaluations on four
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can prevent catastrophic

Navier-Stokes equations (ASNS) with Navier-Hodge-Lions slip boundary condition
has a finite-energy solution that stays bounded for all time. In particular, no
finite-time blowup of the fluid velocity occurs. Compared with standard
smallness assumptions on the initial velocity, no size restriction is made on
the components $v_{0,r}$ and $v_{0,3}$. In a broad sense, this result appears
to solve $2/3$ of the regularity problem of ASNS in such domains in the class
of solutions with the above symmetry. Equivalently, this result is connected to
the general open question which asks that if an absolute smallness of one
component of the initial velocity implies the global smoothness, see e.g. page
873 in \cite{CZZ17}. Our result seems to give a positive answer in a special
setting.
  As a byproduct, we also construct an unbounded solution of the forced Navier
Stokes equation in a special cusp domain that has finite energy. The forcing
term, with the scaling factor of $-1$, is in the standard regularity class.
This result confirms the intuition that if the channel of a fluid is very thin,
arbitrarily high speed in the classical sense can be attained under a mildly
singular force which is physically reasonable in view that Newtonian gravity
and Coulomb force have scaling factor $-2$.

controls the properties of the inner horizon, whose displacement away from the

the conformal factor regularizes the singularity in a way that is parametrized

the stability issues that are common to regular black hole models endowed with

justified in many applications in economics. We show that the nature of the
isotonic estimator can help us to fix many problems of existing matching
methods, including efficiency, choice of the number of matches, choice of
tuning parameters, robustness to propensity score misspecification, and
bootstrap validity. As a by-product, a uniformly consistent isotonic estimator
is developed for our proposed matching method.

(UDA) an attractive technique in many real-world applications, though it also
brings great challenges as model adaptation becomes harder without labeled
target data. In this paper, we address this issue by seeking compensation from
target domain prior knowledge, which is often (partially) available in
practice, e.g., from human expertise. This leads to a novel yet practical
setting where in addition to the training data, some prior knowledge about the
target class distribution are available. We term the setting as
Knowledge-guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (KUDA). In particular, we
consider two specific types of prior knowledge about the class distribution in
the target domain: Unary Bound that describes the lower and upper bounds of
individual class probabilities, and Binary Relationship that describes the
relations between two class probabilities. We propose a general rectification
module that uses such prior knowledge to refine model generated pseudo labels.
The module is formulated as a Zero-One Programming problem derived from the
prior knowledge and a smooth regularizer. It can be easily plugged into
self-training based UDA methods, and we combine it with two state-of-the-art
methods, SHOT and DINE. Empirical results on four benchmarks confirm that the
rectification module clearly improves the quality of pseudo labels, which in
turn benefits the self-training stage. With the guidance from prior knowledge,
the performances of both methods are substantially boosted. We expect our work
to inspire further investigations in integrating prior knowledge in UDA. Code

By leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to
find regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the
pixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform
poorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin
objects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest
are highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic
segmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship
between component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete
cracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will
be masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection
model could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and
avoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale
augmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves
contextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling
small and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important
sampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g.,
railway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which
addresses the imbalanced data challenge.

three distinct types of explosive phase transitions for epidemic dynamics with
capacity-limited interventions. Depending on the capacity limit, interventions
may (i) leave the standard second order phase transition unchanged but
exponentially suppress the probability of large outbreaks, (ii) induce a
first-order discontinuous transition to macroscopic outbreaks, or (iii) cause a
secondary explosive yet continuous third-order transition. These insights
highlight inherent limitations in predicting and containing epidemic outbreaks.
More generally our study offers a cornerstone example of a third order

paper puts forward a generally applicable 'push-button' solution to problems of

diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both
demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term
dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity
is determined by the sign of $\Lambda_0$, the external Lyapunov exponent, as
follows: $\Lambda_0<0$ implies (asymptotic) extinction and $\Lambda_0>0$
implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution $\mu_0$. If
the system is of size $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\epsilon>0$ (the
intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the
extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the
dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD)
$\mu_\epsilon$ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is
well-known under mild assumptions.
  We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, i.e.,
when $\epsilon\to 0$. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a
key role: 1) If $\Lambda_0<0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \delta_0$, the mean
extinction time is of order $|\ln \epsilon|$ and the extinction rate associated
with the QSD $\mu_{\epsilon}$ has a lower bound of order
$\frac{1}{|\ln\epsilon|}$; 2) If $\Lambda_0>0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \mu_0$,
the mean extinction time is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ and the
extinction rate is polynomial in $\epsilon^{2}$. Furthermore, when
$\Lambda_0>0$ we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics:
at first the process quickly approaches the QSD $\mu_\epsilon$ and then, after
spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We
give sharp asymptotics in $\epsilon$ for the time spent close to
$\mu_\epsilon$.

homogeneous (or only mildly heterogeneous) sets of data. More recently, as data
is becoming more accessible, the question of if data sets from different
sources should be integrated is becoming more relevant. The current literature
treats this as a question with only two answers: integrate or don't. Here we
take a different approach, motivated by information-sharing principles coming
from the shrinkage estimation literature. In particular, we deviate from the
do/don't perspective and propose a dial parameter that controls the extent to
which two data sources are integrated. How far this dial parameter should be
turned is shown to depend, for example, on the informativeness of the different
data sources as measured by Fisher information. In the context of generalized
linear models, this more nuanced data integration framework leads to relatively
simple parameter estimates and valid tests/confidence intervals. Moreover, we
demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that setting the dial parameter
according to our recommendation leads to more efficient estimation compared to
other binary data integration schemes.

possible for the first time with JWST. One challenge to characterizing such
planets is that it is not known a priori whether they possess optically thick
atmospheres or even any atmospheres altogether. But this challenge also
presents an opportunity - the potential to detect the surface of an extrasolar
world. This study explores the feasibility of characterizing the atmosphere and
surface of a terrestrial exoplanet with JWST, taking LHS 3844b as a test case
because it is the highest signal-to-noise rocky thermal emission target among
planets that are cool enough to have non-molten surfaces. We model the
planetary emission, including the spectral signal of both atmosphere and
surface, and we explore all scenarios that are consistent with the existing
Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m measurement of LHS 3844b from Kreidberg et al. (2019). In
summary, we find a range of plausible surfaces and atmospheres that are within
3 $\sigma$ of the observation - less reflective metal-rich, iron oxidized and
basaltic compositions are allowed, and atmospheres are restricted to a maximum
thickness of 1 bar, if near-infrared absorbers at $\gtrsim$ 100 ppm are
included. We further make predictions on the observability of surfaces and
atmospheres, perform a Bayesian retrieval analysis on simulated JWST data and
find that a small number, ~3, of eclipse observations should suffice to
differentiate between surface and atmospheric features. However, the surface
signal may make it harder to place precise constraints on the abundance of
atmospheric species and may even falsely induce a weak H$_2$O detection.

learned form sensor data and used for data cleanup, model completion, shape
editing, and shape synthesis. Current neural representations can be categorized
as either overfitting to a single object instance, or representing a collection
of objects. However, neither allows accurate editing of neural scene
representations: on the one hand, methods that overfit objects achieve highly
accurate reconstructions, but do not generalize to unseen object configurations
and thus cannot support editing; on the other hand, methods that represent a
family of objects with variations do generalize but produce only approximate
reconstructions. We propose NEUFORM to combine the advantages of both
overfitted and generalizable representations by adaptively using the one most
appropriate for each shape region: the overfitted representation where reliable
data is available, and the generalizable representation everywhere else. We
achieve this with a carefully designed architecture and an approach that blends
the network weights of the two representations, avoiding seams and other
artifacts. We demonstrate edits that successfully reconfigure parts of
human-designed shapes, such as chairs, tables, and lamps, while preserving
semantic integrity and the accuracy of an overfitted shape representation. We
compare with two state-of-the-art competitors and demonstrate clear
improvements in terms of plausibility and fidelity of the resultant edits.

and dynamics of each robot. The proposed D3G enables each robot to
automatically tune its individual dynamics and objectives in a distributed

This learning framework features a new design, including a forward-pass, where
all robots collaboratively seek Nash equilibrium of a game, and a
backward-pass, where gradients are propagated via the communication graph. We
test the D3G in simulation with two types of robots given different task

interactions between the physical qubits lead to effective interactions between

only the intrinsic two-body interactions and control of individual physical

Li-enriched RGB stars might also be related to either enhanced extra-mixing or
pollution from external sources. We measure the Li abundance and carbon
isotopic ratio 12C/13C in a sample of 166 field red giants with
-0.3<[Fe/H]<0.2, targeted by the EXPRESS radial velocity program to analyze the
effects of extra-mixing. Multiple-epoch observations needed for exoplanet

measurements. Due to the prevalence of upper limits, the Li abundance pattern
is complicated to interpret, but the comparison between RGB and core-He burning
giants shows effects of extra-mixing consistent with thermohaline. The most
Li-enriched giant in the sample, classified as a RGB star close to the RGB
bump, has low 12C/13C. Given that the 12C/13C should not be affected by planet
engulfment, this does not seem to be the source of the high Li. There is a
decreasing correlation between mass and 12C/13C in the RGB and an increasing
correlation in the horizontal branch, which, once again, is consistent with
thermohaline mixing. Our data also shows a correlation between 12C/13C and
[Fe/H]. There is no evident impact of binarity either on Li or on 12C/13C. Our
sample shows behavior consistent with additional mixing acting after the RGB
bump. The 12C/13C adds new clues to describe extra-mixing, and could well be

nonlinear thermoelectric effect, predicted and observed in SIS' junctions is
not affected by the competitive effect of the Josephson coupling. From a
fundamental perspective, the most intriguing feature of this effect is its
bipolarity. The capability to open and control the BLG gap guarantees improved
thermoelectric performances, that reach up to 1 mV/K regarding the Seebeck
coefficient and a power density of 1 nW/$\mu$m$^2$ for temperature gradients of
tens of Kelvins. Furthermore, the externally controlled gating can also dope
the BLG, which is otherwise intrinsically PH symmetric, giving us the
opportunity to investigate the bipolar thermoelectricity even in presence of a
controlled suppression of the PH symmetry. The predicted robustness of this
system could foster further experimental investigations and applications in the
near future, thanks to the available techniques of nano-fabrication.

For $n\geqslant 3$, this implies nonlinearity, and for $n\geqslant 2$, the
existence of $F_2$ in ${\rm Aut}(X)$ (hence nonamenability of the latter) for

approximate 3-coloring have primarily centered around SDP-based rounding.
However, it is likely that important combinatorial or algebraic insights are
needed in order to break the $n^{o(1)}$ threshold. One way to develop new
understanding in graph coloring is to study special subclasses of graphs. For
instance, Blum studied the 3-coloring of random graphs, and Arora and Ge
studied the 3-coloring of graphs with low threshold-rank.
  In this work, we study graphs which arise from a tensor product, which appear
to be novel instances of the 3-coloring problem. We consider graphs of the form
$H = (V,E)$ with $V =V( K_3 \times G)$ and $E = E(K_3 \times G) \setminus E'$,
where $E' \subseteq E(K_3 \times G)$ is any edge set such that no vertex has
more than an $\epsilon$ fraction of its edges in $E'$. We show that one can
construct $\widetilde{H} = K_3 \times \widetilde{G}$ with $V(\widetilde{H}) =
V(H)$ that is close to $H$. For arbitrary $G$, $\widetilde{H}$ satisfies $|E(H)
\Delta E(\widetilde{H})| \leq O(\epsilon|E(H)|)$. Additionally when $G$ is a
mild expander, we provide a 3-coloring for $H$ in polynomial time. These
results partially generalize an exact tensor factorization algorithm of Imrich.
On the other hand, without any assumptions on $G$, we show that it is NP-hard

the idea of axial self-attention to save the memory cost and accelerate the

impact of new interventions, and calls for novel wearable technologies.
Egocentric video can capture hand-object interactions in context, as well as
show how more-affected hands are used during bilateral tasks (for stabilization
or manipulation). Automated methods are required to extract this information.
Objective: To use artificial intelligence-based computer vision to classify
hand use and hand role from egocentric videos recorded at home after stroke.
Methods: Twenty-one stroke survivors participated in the study. A random forest
classifier, a SlowFast neural network, and the Hand Object Detector neural
network were applied to identify hand use and hand role at home.
Leave-One-Subject-Out-Cross-Validation (LOSOCV) was used to evaluate the
performance of the three models. Between-group differences of the models were
calculated based on the Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: For
hand use detection, the Hand Object Detector had significantly higher
performance than the other models. The macro average MCCs using this model in
the LOSOCV were 0.50 +- 0.23 for the more-affected hands and 0.58 +- 0.18 for
the less-affected hands. Hand role classification had macro average MCCs in the
LOSOCV that were close to zero for all models. Conclusion: Using egocentric
video to capture the hand use of stroke survivors at home is feasible. Pose

roles in the future.

behavioral economics to model consumers' behavior in response to a PWYW pricing
strategy where there is an information asymmetry between the consumer and
supplier. In an effort to minimize the information asymmetry, we incorporated
the supplier's cost and the consumer's reference prices as two parameters that
might influence the consumer's payment decision. Our model shows that
consumers' behavior varies depending on the available information. As a result,
when an external reference point is provided, the consumer tends to pay higher
amounts to follow the social herd or respect her self-image. However, the
external reference price can also decrease her demand when, in the interest of
fairness, she forgoes the purchase because the amount she is willing to pay is
less that what she recognizes to be an unrecoverable cost to the supplier.

Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters to analyze
$15455$ forecasting contests to predict a variety of economic indicators. We
find that the median has advantages over the mean as a method to combine the
experts' estimates: the odds that the crowd beats all participants of a

$0.026$ when it is given by the median. In addition, the median is always
guaranteed to beat the majority of the participants, whereas the mean beats

yield a $20$ percent error on the average, which must be contrasted with the
$15$ percent error of the contests' winners. A standard time series forecasting
algorithm, the ARIMA model, yields a $31$ percent error on the average.

equivariance as a model constraint is typically not possible with 2D image

just produce ""positive parts"" of whole algebras. We also provide a geometric
sufficient criterion ensuring the vanishing of the commutator between two
different operators.
  In the quiver case, we obtain the action of the two-dimensional cohomological
Hall algebra of a quiver on the cohomology of Nakajima quiver varieties within
our framework. Besides the quiver case, we also apply our framework to two
torsion pairs on a smooth projective complex surface, and we investigate the
corresponding Hall algebras and their representations associated to them.
Finally, we slightly modify our method to construct representations of the
cohomological Hall algebra of zero-dimensional sheaves on $S$ on the
Borel-Moore homology of the moduli spaces of Pandharipande-Thomas stable pairs
on surfaces and on relative Hilbert schemes of points (and we obtain similar
results at the level of K-theory and bounded derived category).

energy distribution (SED) modeling using the Code Investigating GALaxy Emission
(CIGALE) and UltraNest codes. The radio SEDs include our new observations at
325 and 610 MHz from the GMRT and the measurements from public archives. Our
main results are (1) radio SEDs show turnovers and bends, (2) the synchrotron
spectral index of the fitted radio spectra ranges between $-$0.5 and $-$1.7,
and (3) the infrared luminosity, dust mass, dust temperature, stellar mass,
star-formation rates (SFRs) and AGN fraction obtained from CIGALE falls in the
range exhibited by galaxies of the same class. The ratio of 60$\mu$m infrared
and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, the 1.4 GHz thermal fraction, and emission
measure range between 2.1 and 2.9, 0.1% and 10%, 0.02 and 269.5$\times$10$^{6}$
cm$^{-6}$ pc, respectively. We conclude that the turnovers seen in the radio
SEDs are due to free-free absorption; this is supported by the low AGN fraction
derived from the CIGALE analysis. The decomposed 1.4 GHz thermal and nonthermal
radio luminosities allowed us to compute the star formation rate (SFR) using
scaling relations. A positive correlation is observed between the SFR$_{IR}$
obtained 10 Myr ago (compared to 100 Myr ago) and 1.4 GHz radio (total and
nonthermal) because similar synchrotron lifetimes are expected for typical
magnetic field strengths observed in these galaxies ($\approx$50$\mu$G).

Lagrangian. Although the canonical fields acquire regular propagators,
irregular propagators persist for the field associated to the measure of the
second-class constraints. Loops can be formed with the irregular propagators
producing potentially dangerous subdivergences. We show that all these loops
cancel exactly between them due to a perfect matching between the propagators

regularizers for denoising signals and images. Sparsity-promoting
regularization is a key ingredient in solving modern signal reconstruction
problems; however, the operators underlying these regularizers are usually
either designed by hand or learned from data in an unsupervised way. The recent
success of supervised learning (mainly convolutional neural networks) in
solving image reconstruction problems suggests that it could be a fruitful
approach to designing regularizers. Towards this end, we propose to denoise
signals using a variational formulation with a parametric, sparsity-promoting
regularizer, where the parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize
the mean squared error of reconstructions on a training set of ground truth
image and measurement pairs. Training involves solving a challenging bilievel
optimization problem; we derive an expression for the gradient of the training
loss using the closed-form solution of the denoising problem and provide an
accompanying gradient descent algorithm to minimize it. Our experiments with
structured 1D signals and natural images show that the proposed method can
learn an operator that outperforms well-known regularizers (total variation,
DCT-sparsity, and unsupervised dictionary learning) and collaborative filtering
for denoising. While the approach we present is specific to denoising, we
believe that it could be adapted to the larger class of inverse problems with
linear measurement models, giving it applicability in a wide range of signal

early-time spectra dominated by \FeIII\ features and a weak \SiII\,6355\,\AA\
line, but it exhibited a high-velocity \CaII\,H\&K line and morphed into a
spectroscopically normal SN\,Ia earlier. Three explosion models are
investigated, yielding comparable fits. The innermost layers are dominated by
$\sim 0.3$\,\Msun\ of neutron-rich stable Fe-group elements, mostly stable
iron. Above that central region lies a \Nifs-dominated shell, extending to $v
\approx 11,000$ -- $12,000$\,\kms, with mass $\sim 0.65$\,\Msun. These inner
layers are therefore similar to those of normal SNe\,Ia. However, the outer
layers exhibit composition peculiarities similar to those of SN\,1991T: the
intermediate-mass elements shell is very thin, containing only $\sim
0.2$\,\Msun, and is sharply separated from an outer oxygen-dominated shell,
which includes $\sim 0.22$\,\Msun. These results imply that burning suddenly
stopped in SN\,1999aa. This is a feature SN\,1999aa shares with SN\,1991T, and
explain the peculiarities of both SNe, which are quite similar in nature apart
from the different luminosities. The spectroscopic path from normal to
SN\,1991T-like SNe\,Ia cannot be explained solely by a temperature sequence. It
also involves composition layering differences, suggesting variations in the
progenitor density structure or in the explosion parameters.

recent years, especially in outdoor environments. However, depth prediction
results are not satisfying in indoor scenes where most of the existing data are
captured with hand-held devices. As compared to outdoor environments,
estimating depth of monocular videos for indoor environments, using
self-supervised methods, results in two additional challenges: (i) the depth
range of indoor video sequences varies a lot across different frames, making it
difficult for the depth network to induce consistent depth cues for training;
(ii) the indoor sequences recorded with handheld devices often contain much
more rotational motions, which cause difficulties for the pose network to
predict accurate relative camera poses. In this work, we propose a novel
framework-MonoIndoor++ by giving special considerations to those challenges and
consolidating a set of good practices for improving the performance of
self-supervised monocular depth estimation for indoor environments. First, a
depth factorization module with transformer-based scale regression network is
proposed to estimate a global depth scale factor explicitly, and the predicted
scale factor can indicate the maximum depth values. Second, rather than using a
single-stage pose estimation strategy as in previous methods, we propose to
utilize a residual pose estimation module to estimate relative camera poses
across consecutive frames iteratively. Third, to incorporate extensive
coordinates guidance for our residual pose estimation module, we propose to
perform coordinate convolutional encoding directly over the inputs to pose
networks. The proposed method is validated on a variety of benchmark indoor
datasets, i.e., EuRoC MAV, NYUv2, ScanNet and 7-Scenes, demonstrating the
state-of-the-art performance.

influence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show
that there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$
different candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower
bounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a
construction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.
Additionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over
ballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any
feasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions
influence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different
winners impossible but still allows at least $\Omega(\sqrt k)$. Finally, we
analyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to

the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial
resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end
deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of
the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and
last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal
correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this
process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial)
resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In
this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to
enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among
features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the
spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low-
and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and
interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are
respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation
among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion
consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among
reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks,

repeatedly observed over the past decade for 3 days during each perihelion

activity is still debated, and the suggested mechanisms lack clear supporting
evidence. Phaethon has been identified as the likely parent body of the annual
Geminid meteor shower, making it one of the few active asteroids associated
with a meteoroid stream. Its low albedo and B-type reflectance spectrum
indicates that Phaethon's composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite
meteorites, but a connection to a specific meteorite group is ambiguous due to
the lack of diagnostic absorption features. In this study, we analyze the
mid-infrared emissivity spectrum of Phaethon and find that it is closely
associated with the Yamato-group (CY) of carbonaceous chondrites. The CY
chondrites represent primitive carbonaceous material that experienced early
aqueous alteration and subsequent late-stage thermal metamorphism. Minerals in
these meteorites, some of which we identify in Phaethon's spectrum, show
evidence of thermal decomposition; notably, the dehydroxylation and
transformation of phyllosilicates into poorly crystalline olivine.
Additionally, sulfides and carbonates in CYs are known release S2and CO2 gas
upon heating to ~700oC. We show that Phaethon's surface temperature during its
observed window of activity is consistent with the thermal decomposition
temperatures of several components in CY meteorites. All of these lines of
evidence are strong indicators that gas release from thermal decomposition
reactions is responsible for Phaethon's activity. The results of this study
have implications for the formation of the Geminid meteoroid stream, the
origins of thermally-altered primitive meteorites, and the destruction of

dependent magnetization $M(B)$ variation below $\approx 80$\,K and the reduced
entropy at the ordering temperature $S(T_N)= 0.64R\ln(8)$. A significant change
of the exchange interactions occurs between $T\approx 70$\,K (where $\theta_P =
18$\,K) and $T_N = 13.3$\,K (where $\theta_P =-4.5$\,K). The strong electronic
overlap, arising from the reduced Eu-Eu spacing compared with that of pure

derivatives of the magnetic parameters: $\partial \chi/\partial T$ and
$\partial M/\partial B$, and the field dependence of the specific heat. Two
critical points are recognized and a tentative description of the magnetic
structures is proposed. The possible formation of a skyrmion lattice, that
arises from the presence of magnetically frustrated pockets in the phase
diagram, is suggested by theoretical studies on hexagonal structures exhibiting
similar interactions pattern.

in a vibrated powder bed consisting of glass beads of 5 {\mu}m in diameter. The
vibrated powder bed exhibits three distinct phases depending on the vibration
conditions: consolidation (CS), static fracture (SF), and dynamic fracture
(DF). Particularly, we found an upward wave propagation in the DF regime when
the powder bed is strongly vibrated. As a remarkable feature, we found that in
fine cohesive powders, the decompaction-wave propagation speed normalized to
gravitational speed is independent of the shaking strength. This result implies
that the wave propagation speed is governed by the balance between gravity and
cohesion effect rather than vibration strength. We also explore the
universality of wave propagation phenomenon in coarser and low-density granular
powders.

efficiently and effectively accomplish tasks, better conservation of resources
often results in worse task performance. We specifically address the problem of
finding strategies for managing measurement communication costs between agents.
A well understood technique for trading off communication costs with estimation
accuracy is event triggering (ET), where measurements are only communicated
when useful, e.g., when Kalman filter innovations exceed some threshold. In the
absence of measurements, agents can use implicit information to achieve results
almost as well as when explicit data is always communicated. However, there are
no methods for setting this threshold with formal guarantees on task
performance. We fill this gap by developing a novel belief space discretization
technique to abstract a continuous space dynamics model for ET estimation to a
discrete Markov decision process, which scalably accommodates
threshold-sensitive ET estimator error covariances. We then apply an existing
probabilistic trade-off analysis tool to find the set of all optimal trade-offs
between resource consumption and task performance. From this set, an ET
threshold selection strategy is extracted. Simulated results show our approach
identifies non-trivial trade-offs between performance and energy savings, with
only modest computational effort.

the main factors responsible for within-class variance of genuine comparison
scores in iris recognition. In dominant approaches to iris recognition, the
size of a ring-shaped iris region is linearly scaled to a canonical rectangle,
used further in encoding and matching. However, the biological complexity of
the iris sphincter and dilator muscles causes the movements of iris features to
be nonlinear in a function of pupil size, and not solely organized along radial
paths. Alternatively to the existing theoretical models based on the
biomechanics of iris musculature, in this paper we propose a novel deep
autoencoder-based model that can effectively learn complex movements of iris
texture features directly from the data. The proposed model takes two inputs,
(a) an ISO-compliant near-infrared iris image with initial pupil size, and (b)
the binary mask defining the target shape of the iris. The model makes all the
necessary nonlinear deformations to the iris texture to match the shape of the
iris in an image (a) with the shape provided by the target mask (b). The
identity-preservation component of the loss function helps the model in finding
deformations that preserve identity and not only the visual realism of the
generated samples. We also demonstrate two immediate applications of this
model: better compensation for iris texture deformations in iris recognition
algorithms, compared to linear models, and the creation of a generative
algorithm that can aid human forensic examiners, who may need to compare iris
images with a large difference in pupil dilation. We offer the source codes and
model weights available along with this paper.

Materials, lights and cameras need to be set in order to get the best quality
results. Nevertheless, the optimal output may not be obtained in the first
render. This all makes the rendering process a tedious process. Since
Goodfellow et al. introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014
[1], they have been used to generate computer-assigned synthetic data, from
non-existing human faces to medical data analysis or image style transfer. GANs
have been used to transfer image textures from one domain to another. However,
paired data from both domains was needed. When Zhu et al. introduced the
CycleGAN model, the elimination of this expensive constraint permitted
transforming one image from one domain into another, without the need for
paired data. This work validates the applicability of CycleGANs on style
transfer from an initial sketch to a final render in 2D that represents a 3D

number of Resident Space Objects has steadily increased. It is estimated that
around one million objects larger than one cm are currently orbiting the Earth,
with only thirty thousand larger than ten cm being tracked. To avert a chain
reaction of collisions, known as Kessler Syndrome, it is essential to
accurately track and predict debris and satellites' orbits. Current approximate
physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day
predictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris, typically
with less than one meter. This failure is usually due to uncertainty around the
state of the space object at the beginning of the trajectory, forecasting
errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown
characteristics such as the mass or geometry of the space object. Operators can
enhance Orbit Prediction accuracy by deriving unmeasured objects'
characteristics and improving non-conservative forces' effects by leveraging
data-driven techniques, such as Machine Learning. In this survey, we provide an

we consider known environment (i.e., known system statistics) and develop a

devise a learning-based transmission policy by relaxing the CMDP problem into

a deep learning system (DLS) that takes external eye photos as input and
predicts multiple systemic parameters, such as those related to the liver
(albumin, AST); kidney (eGFR estimated using the race-free 2021 CKD-EPI

and blood count (Hgb, WBC, platelets). Development leveraged 151,237 images

systemic parameters and leveraged 3 validation sets (A, B, C) spanning 28,869
patients with and without diabetes undergoing eye screening in 3 independent
sites in Los Angeles County, CA, and the greater Atlanta area, GA. We compared
against baseline models incorporating available clinicodemographic variables

the DLS achieved statistically significant superior performance at detecting
AST>36, calcium<8.6, eGFR<60, Hgb<11, platelets<150, ACR>=300, and WBC<4 on
validation set A (a patient population similar to the development sets), where

extracted from the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum by marginalizing the memory
of reionization over cosmological information. This impact of cosmic
reionization on the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum can survive cosmological
time scales because cosmic reionization, which is inhomogeneous, and subsequent
shocks from denser regions can heat the gas in low-density regions to $\sim
3\times10^4$ K and compress it to mean-density. Current approach of
marginalization over the memory of reionization, however, is not only
model-dependent, based on the assumption of a specific reionization model, but
also computationally expensive. Here we propose a simple analytical template
for the impact of cosmic reionization, thereby treating it as a broadband
systematic to be marginalized over for Bayesian inference of cosmological
information from the Ly$\alpha$ forest in a model-independent manner. This
template performs remarkably well with an error of $\leq 6 \%$ at large scales
$k \approx 0.19$ Mpc$^{-1}$ where the effect of the memory of reionization is
important, and reproduces the broadband effect of the memory of reionization in
the Ly$\alpha$ forest correlation function, as well as the expected bias of
cosmological parameters due to this systematic. The template can successfully
recover the morphology of forecast errors in cosmological parameter space as
expected when assuming a specific reionization model for marginalization
purposes, with a slight overestimation of tens of per cent for the forecast
errors on the cosmological parameters. We further propose a similar template
for this systematic on the Ly$\alpha$ forest 1D power spectrum.

increasingly important in many scientific fields. Most literature develop a
variety of separate methods designed for specified models (e.g. mean shift

provide a unified framework for structural break detection which is suitable
for a large class of models. Moreover, the proposed algorithm automatically
achieves consistent parameter estimates during the change point detection
process, without the need for refitting the model. Specifically, we introduce a
three-step procedure. The first step utilizes the block segmentation strategy
combined with a fused lasso based estimation criterion, leads to significant
computational gains without compromising the statistical accuracy in
identifying the number and location of the structural breaks. This procedure is
further coupled with hard-thresholding and exhaustive search steps to
consistently estimate the number and location of the break points. The strong
guarantees are proved on both the number of estimated change points and the
rates of convergence of their locations. The consistent estimates of model
parameters are also provided. The numerical studies provide further support of
the theory and validate its competitive performance for a wide range of models.

simulations and the breakdown of raytracing approximation. Previous studies of
LHCD using non-Maxwellian full-wave/FP simulations have been performed, but
these simulations were not self-consistent and enforced power conservation
between the FP and full-wave code using a numerical rescaling factor. Here we
have created a fully-self consistent full-wave/FP model for LHCD that is
automatically power conserving. This was accomplished by coupling an overhauled
version of the non-Maxwellian TORLH full-wave solver and the CQL3D FP code
using the Integrated Plasma Simulator. We performed converged full-wave/FP
simulations of Alcator C-Mod discharges and compared them to raytracing. We
found that excellent agreement in the power deposition profiles from raytracing
and TORLH could be obtained, however, TORLH had somewhat lower current drive
efficiency and broader power deposition profiles in some cases. This
discrepancy appears to be a result of numerical limitations present in the
TORLH model and a small amount of diffractional broadening of the TORLH wave
spectrum. Our results suggest full-wave simulation of LHCD is likely not
necessary as diffraction and interference represented only a small correction

Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) 2022 Competition. The three tasks that are
considered in this challenge are valence-arousal(VA) estimation, classification
of expressions into 6 basic (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness,
surprise), neutral, and the 'other' category and 12 action units(AU) numbered
AU-{1,2,4,6,7,10,12,15,23,24,25,26}. Our method Semi-supervised Multi-task
Facial Affect Recognition titled SS-MFAR uses a deep residual network with task
specific classifiers for each of the tasks along with adaptive thresholds for
each expression class and semi-supervised learning for the incomplete labels.

monitoring data's large volume and variety and complex dependencies across or
within its components (e.g., services or databases). Furthermore, engineers
require fault localization solutions to be actionable and interpretable, which
existing research approaches cannot satisfy. Therefore, the common industry
practice is that, for a specific online service system, its experienced
engineers focus on localization for recurring failures based on the knowledge
accumulated about the system and historical failures. Although the above common
practice is actionable and interpretable, it is largely manual, thus slow and
sometimes inaccurate. In this paper, we aim to automate this practice through
machine learning. That is, we propose an actionable and interpretable fault
localization approach, DejaVu, for recurring failures in online service
systems. For a specific online service system, DejaVu takes historical failures
and dependencies in the system as input and trains a localization model
offline; for an incoming failure, the trained model online recommends where the
failure occurs (i.e., the faulty components) and which kind of failure occurs
(i.e., the indicative group of metrics) (thus actionable), which are further
interpreted by both global and local interpretation methods (thus
interpretable). Based on the evaluation on 601 failures from three production
systems and one open-source benchmark, in less than one second, DejaVu can on
average rank the ground truths at 1.66-th to 5.03-th among a long candidate
list, outperforming baselines by at least 51.51%.

identification system to ensure the security of the utilized software. However,
most of the existing works for security patch identification just consider the
changed code and the commit message of a commit as a flat sequence of tokens
with simple neural networks to learn its semantics, while the structure
information is ignored. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose
our well-designed approach E-SPI, which extracts the structure information
hidden in a commit for effective identification. Specifically, it consists of
the code change encoder to extract the syntactic of the changed code with the
BiLSTM to learn the code representation and the message encoder to construct
the dependency graph for the commit message with the graph neural network (GNN)
to learn the message representation. We further enhance the code change encoder
by embedding contextual information related to the changed code. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct the extensive experiments against
six state-of-the-art approaches on the existing dataset and from the real

the design allows for further advancement of compact, high-sensitivity, quantum

quantum-enhanced accelerometers and gyroscopes. We discuss TAI protocols for
both spin-dependent and scalar trapping potentials. Using optimal control
theory, we demonstrate the splitting of the wave function on a time scale two
orders of magnitude shorter than the previous proposal using adiabatic

interferometric phase is accumulated. Lastly, we explore the possibility of

four scientific contributions towards the development of personalized ambient

environments. First, it presents a probabilistic reasoning-based mathematical
approach to model all possible forms of user interactions for any activity
arising from the user diversity of multiple users in such environments. Second,
it presents a system that uses this approach with a machine learning method to
model individual user profiles and user-specific user interactions for
detecting the dynamic indoor location of each specific user. Third, to address
the need to develop highly accurate indoor localization systems for increased
trust, reliance, and seamless user acceptance, the framework introduces a novel
methodology where two boosting approaches Gradient Boosting and the AdaBoost
algorithm are integrated and used on a decision tree-based learning model to
perform indoor localization. Fourth, the framework introduces two novel
functionalities to provide semantic context to indoor localization in terms of
detecting each user's floor-specific location as well as tracking whether a
specific user was located inside or outside a given spatial region in a
multi-floor-based indoor setting. These novel functionalities of the proposed
framework were tested on a dataset of localization-related Big Data collected

254 indoor spatial regions. The results show that this approach of indoor
localization for personalized AAL that models each specific user always

associated limitations of quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly correlated

associated with special symmetries for which the sign problem is absent or
because particular fillings are often primary targets, e.g.~those densities
which maximize superconducting transition temperature (the top of the `dome' of
cuprate systems). Here we describe a new analysis of the sign problem, which
demonstrates that the {\it spin-resolved} sign $\langle {\cal S}_\sigma\rangle$
already possesses signatures of universal behavior traditionally associated
with order parameters, even in the absence of symmetry protection that makes
$\langle {\cal S} \rangle = 1$. When appropriately scaled, $\langle {\cal

show these behaviors occur in the vicinity of quantum critical points of three
well-understood models, exhibiting either second-order or Kosterlitz-Thouless

UV-shielding to be able to increase emission of organics. Here, we expand on
these models and investigate how UV-shielding may impact chemical composition
in the inner 5 au. In this work, we use the model from arxiv:2204.07108 and
expand it with a larger chemical network. We focus on the chemical abundances
in the upper disk atmosphere where the effects of water UV-shielding are most
prominent and molecular lines originate. We find rich carbon and nitrogen
chemistry with enhanced abundances of C2H2, CH4, HCN, CH3CN, and NH3 by > 3
orders of magnitude. This is caused by the self-shielding of H2O, which locks
oxygen in water. This subsequently results in a suppression of
oxygen-containing species like CO and CO2. The increase in C2H2 seen in the
model with the inclusion of water UV-shielding allows us to explain the
observed C2H2 abundance without resorting to elevated C/O ratios as water
UV-shielding induced an effectively oxygen-poor environment in oxygen-rich gas.
Thus, water UV-shielding is important for reproducing the observed abundances
of hydrocarbons and nitriles. From our model result, species like CH4, NH3, and
NO are expected to be observable with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

estimate uncertainty, but these parameters are often subject to the same
vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by adversarial attacks. We propose a
novel ensemble approach based on feature decorrelation and Fourier partitioning
for teaching networks diverse complementary features, reducing the chance of
perturbation-based fooling. We test our approach on electrocardiogram
classification, demonstrating superior accuracy confidence measurement, on a
variety of adversarial attacks. For example, on our ensemble trained with both

angle-independent tetrad-component metric. That is, we shall write $g_{ab} =
g_{AB} \; e^A{}_a\; e^B{}_b$ seeking to keep both the tetrad-component metric
$g_{AB}$ and the non-ortho-normal co-tetrad $e^A{}_a$ relatively simple but
non-trivial. We shall see that it is possible to put all the mass dependence
into $g_{AB}$, while the non-ortho-normal co-tetrad $e^A{}_a$ can be chosen to
be a mass-independent representation of flat Minkowski space in oblate
spheroidal coordinates: $(g_\mathrm{Minkowski})_{ab} = \eta_{AB} \; e^A{}_a\;
e^B{}_b$. This procedure separates out, to the greatest extent possible, the
mass dependence from the rotational dependence, and makes the Kerr solution

invariant under tilting. The second class applies when the elasticity is
non-linear, or the surface grows preferentially in its normal direction. It
encompasses fluid imbibition, the Tang-Leschorn cellular automaton of 1992
(TL92), depinning with anharmonic elasticity (aDep), and qKPZ. While the field
theory is well developed for qEW, there is no consistent theory for qKPZ. The
aim of this paper is to construct this field theory within the Functional
renormalization group (FRG) framework, based on large-scale numerical
simulations in dimensions $d=1$, $2$ and $3$, presented in a companion paper.
In order to measure the effective force correlator and coupling constants, the
driving force is derived from a confining potential with curvature $m^2$. We
show, that contrary to common belief this is allowed in the presence of a KPZ
term. The ensuing field theory becomes massive, and can no longer be Cole-Hopf
transformed. In exchange, it possesses an IR attractive stable fixed point at a
finite KPZ non-linearity $\lambda$. Since there is neither elasticity nor a KPZ
term in dimension $d=0$, qEW and qKPZ merge there. As a result, the two
universality classes are distinguished by terms linear in $d$. This allows us
to build a consistent field theory in dimension $d=1$, which loses some of its

system utilizes a collimated laser beam to illuminate the tracers with internal
markers and a digital sensor to record the generated holograms. The tracers
made of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer mixed with internal markers
are fabricated using a standard microfluidic droplet generator. A rotation
measurement algorithm is developed based on the 3D location reconstruction and
tracking of the internal markers and is assessed through synthetic holograms to
identify the optimal parameter settings and measurement range (e.g., rotation
rate from 0.3 to 0.7 rad/frame under numerical aperture of imaging of 0.25).
Our proposed method based on DIH is evaluated by a calibration experiment of
single tracer rotation, which yields the same optimal measurement range. Using
von K\'arm\'an swirling flow setup, we further demonstrate the capability of
the approach to simultaneously measure the Lagrangian rotation and translation
of multiple tracers. Our method can measure vorticity in a small region on the
order of 100 ${\mu}$m or less and can be potentially used to quantify the
Kolmogorov-scale vorticity field in turbulent flows.

investigate hierarchical properties of spatial distribution of young stellar
objects (YSOs) in this region. We develop a minimum spanning tree (MST)-based

longer than an algorithmically determined critical value. A total of 832 YSOs
are divided into 5 levels with 23 groups. For describing the hierarchical
properties in a controlled way, we construct a set of synthetic source
distributions at various fractal dimensions, and apply the same method to
explore their group characters. By comparing the $Q$ parameter and the surface
density profiles of the observed and the synthetic data, we find that the YSO
observation matches spatial patterns from multi-fractal dimensions. In the
periphery region where the molecular clouds are more diffuse, the YSO structure
is close to a fractal dimension of 2.0, while in the core regions the fractal
dimensions are close to 1.6 and 1.4 for the W40 and the Serpens South regions,

Myr.

First, we present an automatic domain separation to find the optimal number of

be available in the house to perform assistive tasks. However, when these items
run out, the assistive robot must remind its user to buy the missing items. In
this paper, we present a computational architecture that can allow a robot to
learn personalized contextual knowledge of a household through interactions
with its user. The architecture can then use the learned knowledge to make
predictions about missing items from the household over a long period of time.
The architecture integrates state-of-the-art perceptual learning algorithms,
cognitive models of memory encoding and learning, a reasoning module for
predicting missing items from the household, and a graphical user interface
(GUI) to interact with the user. The architecture is integrated with the Fetch
mobile manipulator robot and validated in a large indoor environment with
multiple contexts and objects. Our experimental results show that the robot can
adapt to an environment by learning contextual knowledge through interactions
with its user. The robot can also use the learned knowledge to correctly
predict missing items over multiple weeks and it is robust against sensory and

networks, hyperbolic space has attracted considerable attention and achieved
impressive performance in the recommender system recently. The advantage of
hyperbolic recommendation lies in that its exponentially increasing capacity is
well-suited to describe the power-law distributed user-item network whereas the
Euclidean equivalent is deficient. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which kinds
of items can be effectively recommended by the hyperbolic model and which
cannot. To address the above concerns, we take the most basic recommendation
technique, collaborative filtering, as a medium, to investigate the behaviors
of hyperbolic and Euclidean recommendation models. The results reveal that (1)
tail items get more emphasis in hyperbolic space than that in Euclidean space,
but there is still ample room for improvement; (2) head items receive modest
attention in hyperbolic space, which could be considerably improved; (3) and
nonetheless, the hyperbolic models show more competitive performance than
Euclidean models. Driven by the above observations, we design a novel learning
method, named hyperbolic informative collaborative filtering (HICF), aiming to
compensate for the recommendation effectiveness of the head item while at the
same time improving the performance of the tail item. The main idea is to adapt
the hyperbolic margin ranking learning, making its pull and push procedure
geometric-aware, and providing informative guidance for the learning of both
head and tail items. Extensive experiments back up the analytic findings and
also show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The work is valuable for
personalized recommendations since it reveals that the hyperbolic space
facilitates modeling the tail item, which often represents user-customized
preferences or new products.

majority categories occupy most of the data while most minority categories
contain a limited number of samples. Classification models minimizing
cross-entropy struggle to represent and classify the tail classes. Although the
problem of learning unbiased classifiers has been well studied, methods for
representing imbalanced data are under-explored. In this paper, we focus on
representation learning for imbalanced data. Recently, supervised contrastive
learning has shown promising performance on balanced data recently. However,
through our theoretical analysis, we find that for long-tailed data, it fails
to form a regular simplex which is an ideal geometric configuration for
representation learning. To correct the optimization behavior of SCL and
further improve the performance of long-tailed visual recognition, we propose a
novel loss for balanced contrastive learning (BCL). Compared with SCL, we have
two improvements in BCL: class-averaging, which balances the gradient
contribution of negative classes; class-complement, which allows all classes to
appear in every mini-batch. The proposed balanced contrastive learning (BCL)
method satisfies the condition of forming a regular simplex and assists the
optimization of cross-entropy. Equipped with BCL, the proposed two-branch
framework can obtain a stronger feature representation and achieve competitive
performance on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10-LT,

low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a
multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple
simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic
complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a
46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively,

that the model is required not only to learn a discriminative classifier to

inputs from unseen classes that never appear at training time. In this paper,
we propose to solve the problem from two novel aspects. First, instead of
learning the decision boundaries between seen classes, as is done in standard
close-set classification, we reserve space for unseen classes, such that images
located in these areas are recognized as the unseen classes. Second, to
effectively learn such decision boundaries, we propose to utilize the
background features from seen classes. As these background regions do not
significantly contribute to the decision of close-set classification, it is
natural to use them as the pseudo unseen classes for classifier learning. Our

complex potential structure between features. We believe that these structures
are very important for the feature selection process, especially when labels
are lacking and data is noisy.
  To this end, we innovatively introduce a deep learning-based self-supervised
mechanism into feature selection problems, namely batch-Attention-based
Self-supervision Feature Selection(A-SFS). Firstly, a multi-task
self-supervised autoencoder is designed to uncover the hidden structure among
features with the support of two pretext tasks. Guided by the integrated
information from the multi-self-supervised learning model, a batch-attention
mechanism is designed to generate feature weights according to batch-based
feature selection patterns to alleviate the impacts introduced by a handful of
noisy data. This method is compared to 14 major strong benchmarks, including
LightGBM and XGBoost. Experimental results show that A-SFS achieves the highest
accuracy in most datasets. Furthermore, this design significantly reduces the
reliance on labels, with only 1/10 labeled data needed to achieve the same
performance as those state of art baselines. Results show that A-SFS is also
most robust to the noisy and missing data.

fill this gap, we propose PiC -- a dataset of ~28K of noun phrases accompanied
by their contextual Wikipedia pages and a suite of three tasks for training and
evaluating phrase embeddings. Training on PiC improves ranking models' accuracy
and remarkably pushes span-selection (SS) models (i.e., predicting the start

Interestingly, we find evidence that such impressive performance is because the
SS models learn to better capture the common meaning of a phrase regardless of
its actual context. SotA models perform poorly in distinguishing two senses of
the same phrase in two contexts (~60% EM) and in estimating the similarity
between two different phrases in the same context (~70% EM).

variable, or the risk factor) is common in epidemiologic and health studies. It
can effect the relative risk estimator or other types of coefficients derived
from the fitted regression model. In order to perform a measurement error
analysis, one needs information about the error structure. Two sources of
validation data are an internal subset of the main data, and external or
independent study. For the both sources, the true covariate is measured (that
is, without error), or alternatively, its surrogate, which is error-prone
covariate, is measured several times (repeated measures). This paper compares
the precision in estimation via the different validation sources in the Cox
model with a changepoint in the main covariate, using the bias correction
methods RC and RR. The theoretical properties under each validation source is
presented. In a simulation study it is found that the best validation source in
terms of smaller mean square error and narrower confidence interval is the
internal validation with measure of the true covariate in a common disease
case, and the external validation with repeated measures of the surrogate for a
rare disease case. In addition, it is found that addressing the correlation
between the true covariate and its surrogate, and the value of the changepoint,
is needed, especially in the rare disease case.

means that galaxy distribution can be a substitution for DM for the

more than 10 years, while the classification accuracy drops by a large margin

tricked into deciding that texts written over a time span of multiple years
were actually written by two different people, which in turn leads us to

analysis of VLR in a class of open-source Federated Learning frameworks, where
the protocols might differ between one another, yet a procedure of obtaining
local gradients is implicitly shared. We first consider the honest-but-curious

only the shared procedure is assumed, which we abstract as an oracle. We find
that even under this general setting, single-dimension feature and label can
still be recovered from the other party under suitable constraints of batch
size, thus demonstrating the potential vulnerability of all frameworks
following the same philosophy. Then we look into a popular instantiation of the
protocol based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE). We propose an active attack that
significantly weaken the constraints on batch size in the previous analysis via
generating and compressing auxiliary ciphertext. To address the privacy leakage
within the HE-based protocol, we develop a simple-yet-effective countermeasure
based on Differential Privacy (DP), and provide both utility and privacy
guarantees for the updated algorithm. Finally, we empirically verify the
effectiveness of our attack and defense on benchmark datasets. Altogether, our
findings suggest that all vertical federated learning frameworks that solely
depend on HE might contain severe privacy risks, and DP, which has already
demonstrated its power in horizontal federated learning, can also play a
crucial role in the vertical setting, especially when coupled with HE or secure

system performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this work, we propose
an optimal deployment method for practical heterogeneous WSNs which gives a
deep insight into the trade-off between the reliability and deployment cost.
Specifically, this work aims to provide the optimal deployment of SNs to
maximize the coverage degree and connection degree, and meanwhile minimize the
overall deployment cost. In addition, this work fully considers the
heterogeneity of SNs (i.e. differentiated sensing range and deployment cost)
and three-dimensional (3-D) deployment scenarios. This is a multi-objective
optimization problem, non-convex, multimodal and NP-hard. To solve it, we
develop a novel swarm-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, known as
the competitive multi-objective marine predators algorithm (CMOMPA) whose
performance is verified by comprehensive comparative experiments with ten other
stateof-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms. The computational
results demonstrate that CMOMPA is superior to others in terms of convergence
and accuracy and shows excellent performance on multimodal multiobjective
optimization problems. Sufficient simulations are also conducted to evaluate
the effectiveness of the CMOMPA based optimal SNs deployment method. The
results show that the optimized deployment can balance the trade-off among

enhance the physical layer security of an integrated sensing and communication

communication for multiple users, but also create a virtual line-of-sight (LoS)
link for target sensing. In particular, we consider a challenging scenario
where the target may be a suspicious eavesdropper that potentially intercepts
the communication-user information transmitted by the base station (BS). We
investigate the joint design of the phase shifts at the IRS and the
communication as well as radar beamformers at the BS to maximize the sensing
beampattern gain towards the target, subject to the maximum information leakage
to the eavesdropping target and the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) required by users. Based on the availability of perfect channel
state information (CSI) of all involved user links and the accurate target
location at the BS, two scenarios are considered and two different optimization
algorithms are proposed. For the ideal scenario where the CSI of the user links
and the target location are perfectly known at the BS, a penalty-based
algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution. In particular, the
beamformers are obtained with a semi-closed-form solution using Lagrange
duality and the IRS phase shifts are solved for in closed form by applying the
majorization-minimization (MM) method. On the other hand, for the more
practical scenario where the CSI is imperfect and the target location is
uncertain, a robust algorithm based on the $\cal S$-procedure and
sign-definiteness approaches is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving a trade-off between the

interest in quantifying the importance of a given input variable for making a

model-agnostic methods to measure variable importance (VI) that analyze the
difference in predictive power between a full model trained on all variables
and a reduced model that excludes the variable(s) of interest. A bottleneck
common to these methods is the estimation of the reduced model for each
variable (or subset of variables), which is an expensive process that often
does not come with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a fast and
flexible method for approximating the reduced model with important inferential
guarantees. We replace the need for fully retraining a wide neural network by a
linearization initialized at the full model parameters. By adding a ridge-like
penalty to make the problem convex, we prove that when the ridge penalty
parameter is sufficiently large, our method estimates the variable importance
measure with an error rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ where $n$ is the number
of training samples. We also show that our estimator is asymptotically normal,
enabling us to provide confidence bounds for the VI estimates. We demonstrate

Theoretically, we analyze the statistical rate of ReBoot for generalized linear
models (GLM) and noisy phase retrieval, which represent convex and non-convex
problems respectively. In both cases, ReBoot provably achieves the full-sample
statistical rate whenever the subsample size is not too small. In particular,
we show that the systematic bias of ReBoot, the error that is independent of
the number of subsamples, is $O(n ^ {-2})$ in GLM, where n is the subsample
size. This rate is sharper than that of model parameter averaging and its
variants, implying the higher tolerance of ReBoot with respect to data splits
to maintain the full-sample rate. Simulation study exhibits the statistical
advantage of ReBoot over competing methods including averaging and CSL

is either selected or not. This final outcome is not considered in IRR, which
instead focuses on the ratings of the individual subjects or objects. In this
work, we outline the connection between the ratings' measurement model (used

approximation which allows us to estimate the probability of correctly
selecting the best applicants and compute error probabilities of the selection
procedure (i.e., false-positive and false-negative rate) under the assumption
of the ratings' validity. If the ratings are not completely valid, the computed
error probabilities correspond to a lower bound on the true error
probabilities. We draw connections between the inter-rater reliability and the

depend solely on the IRR coefficient and proportion of selected applicants. We

Given as input an explicit distribution $\mu$, an $\varepsilon>0$, and access
to sampling oracle(s) for a hidden distribution $\pi$, the goal in identity
testing is to distinguish whether the two distributions $\mu$ and $\pi$ are
identical or are at least $\varepsilon$-far apart. When there is only access to
full samples from the hidden distribution $\pi$, it is known that exponentially
many samples (in the dimension) may be needed for identity testing, and hence
previous works have studied identity testing with additional access to various
""conditional"" sampling oracles. We consider a significantly weaker conditional
sampling oracle, which we call the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$, and provide a
computational and statistical characterization of the identity testing problem
in this new model.
  We prove that if an analytic property known as approximate tensorization of
entropy holds for an $n$-dimensional visible distribution $\mu$, then there is
an efficient identity testing algorithm for any hidden distribution $\pi$ using
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ queries to the $\mathsf{Coordinate\ Oracle}$.
Approximate tensorization of entropy is a pertinent condition as recent works
have established it for a large class of high-dimensional distributions. We
also prove a computational phase transition: for a well-studied class of
$n$-dimensional distributions, specifically sparse antiferromagnetic Ising
models over $\{+1,-1\}^n$, we show that in the regime where approximate
tensorization of entropy fails, there is no efficient identity testing
algorithm unless $\mathsf{RP}=\mathsf{NP}$. We complement our results with a

Considering view-dependent semantic measurements, there is a coupling between
different classes, resulting in a combinatorial number of hypotheses. A common
solution is to prune hypotheses that have a sufficiently low probability and to
retain only a limited number of hypotheses. However, after pruning and
renormalization, the updated probability is overconfident with respect to the
original probability. This is especially problematic for systems that require
high accuracy. If the prior probability of the classes is independent, the
original normalization factor can be computed efficiently without pruning
hypotheses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to present
these results. If the prior probability of the classes is dependent, we propose
a lower bound on the normalization factor that ensures cautious results. The

a decision-making approach for object manipulation in a setting of stacked

Adj-Net, a model that leverages existing Transformer Encoder-Decoder object
detectors by adding an adjacency head. The output of this head
probabilistically infers the underlying hierarchical structure of the objects
in the scene. We utilize the properties of the adjacency matrix in DUQIM-Net to
perform decision making and assist with object-grasping tasks. Our experimental
results show that Adj-Net surpasses the state-of-the-art in object-relationship
inference on the Visual Manipulation Relationship Dataset (VMRD), and that
DUQIM-Net outperforms comparable approaches in bin clearing tasks.

have varying complexity, quality and can result in different utility gained for
the model. The inadequacy of explainability can limit the extent to which
humans can evaluate the decisions, often leading to updates which are unfit for

The novel contribution of this paper is an approach to harnessing
explainability in human-in-the-loop DDDAS and DT systems, leveraging

Descriptor Matching process, event clusters that reappear in a different
polarity are continually tracked, elongating the feature tracks. Thanks to our
clustering approach in spatio-temporal space, our method automatically solves
feature detection and feature tracking simultaneously. Also, eCDT can extract
feature tracks at any frequency with an adjustable time window, which does not
corrupt the high temporal resolution of the original event data. Our method
achieves 30% better feature tracking ages compared with the state-of-the-art

active learning (AL) plays a vital role, but current AL tools 1) require users
to manually select AL strategies, and 2) can not perform AL tasks efficiently.
To this end, this paper presents an automatic and efficient MLOps system for
AL, named ALaaS (Active-Learning-as-a-Service). Specifically, 1) ALaaS
implements an AL agent, including a performance predictor and a workflow
controller, to decide the most suitable AL strategies given users' datasets and
budgets. We call this a predictive-based successive halving early-stop (PSHEA)
procedure. 2) ALaaS adopts a server-client architecture to support an AL
pipeline and implements stage-level parallelism for high efficiency. Meanwhile,
caching and batching techniques are employed to further accelerate the AL
process. In addition to efficiency, ALaaS ensures accessibility with the help
of the design philosophy of configuration-as-a-service. Extensive experiments
show that ALaaS outperforms all other baselines in terms of latency and
throughput. Also, guided by the AL agent, ALaaS can automatically select and
run AL strategies for non-expert users under different datasets and budgets.

photoionized X-ray narrow and broad emission line models. We report on an X-ray

characterize any potential spectroscopic features in addition to the known
primary spectral components that are already modeled in high precision. We
detect a weak unidentified excess emission feature at 18.4 Angstrom (18.1
Angstrom in the restframe). The feature is seen at >5 sigma statistical
significance taking into account the look elsewhere effect. No known
instrumental issues, atomic transitions, and astrophysical effects can explain
this excess. The observed intensity of the possible feature seems to
anti-correlate in time with the hardness ratio of the source. However, the
variability might not be intrinsic, it might be caused by the time-variable
obscuration by the outflows. An intriguing possibility is the line emission
from charge exchange between a partially ionized outflow and a neutral layer in
the same outflow, or in the close environment. Other possibilities, such as
emission from a highly-ionized component with high outflowing speed, cannot be
fully ruled out.

report a new comprehensive catalogue of 386 open clusters. This catalogue has
homogeneous parameter determinations of radial velocity, metallicity, and
dynamical properties, such as orbit, eccentricity, angular momenta, total
energy, and 3D Galactic velocity. These parameters allow the first radial
velocity determination and the first spectroscopic [Fe/H] determination for 44
and 137 clusters, respectively. The metallicity distribution of majority
clusters shows falling trends in the parameter space of the Galactocentric
radius, the total energy, and the Z component of angular momentum -- except for
two old groups that show flat tails in their own parameter planes. Cluster
populations of ages younger and older than 500 Myrs distribute diversely on the

3-D spatial comparison between very young clusters (< 100 Myr) and nearby
molecular clouds revealed a wide range of metallicity distribution along the

function is extended to a slice hyperholomorphic function, by means of the
so-called slice operator. In the second step a monogenic function is built by
applying the Laplace operator in four real variables ($\Delta$) to the slice
hyperholomorphic function. In this paper we use the factorization of the
Laplace operator, i.e. $\Delta= \mathcal{\overline{D}} \mathcal{D}$ to split
the previous procedure. From this splitting we get a class of functions that
lies between the set of slice hyperholomorphic functions and the set of axially
monogenic functions: the set of axially polyanalytic functions of order 2, i.e.
null-solutions of $ \mathcal{D}^2$. We show an integral representation formula
for this kind of functions. The formula obtained is fundamental to define the

the Ly$\alpha$ coupling and X-ray heating, making this signal highly
non-Gaussian. The impact of these processes on the 21-cm signal and its

source parameters i.e. the minimum halo mass $M_{\rm h,\, min}$ and X-ray
photon production efficiency $f_{\rm X}$ in a 1D radiative transfer code
GRIZZLY. We study the impact of variation in these source parameters on the
large scale ($k_1 = 0.16 {\, \rm Mpc}^{-1}$) 21-cm bispectrum for all possible

of the power spectrum and bispectrum shows that the shape, sign and magnitude
of the bispectrum combinedly provide the best measure of the signal
fluctuations and its non-Gaussianity compared to the power spectrum. We also
conclude that it is important to study the sequence of sign changes along with
the variations in the shape and magnitude of the bispectrum throughout the CD
history to arrive at a robust conclusion about the dominant IGM processes at
different cosmic times. We further observe that among all the possible unique
$k$-triangles, the large-scale non-Gaussianity in signal is best probed by the
small $k$-triangles in the squeezed limit and by triangles of similar shapes.
This opens up the possibility of constraining the source parameters during the

universality class of the Anderson transition (AT) driven by QP is similar to
that of the AT driven by the random potential in the same symmetry class. Here,
we study the critical behavior of the ATs driven by QP in the three-dimensional
(3D) Anderson model, Peierls phase model, and Ando model, which belong to the
Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. The localization length and two-terminal
conductance have been calculated by the transfer matrix method, and we argue
that their error estimations in statistics suffer from the correlation of QP.
With the correlation under control, the critical exponents $\nu$ of the ATs
driven by QP are estimated by the finite size scaling analysis of conductance,
which are consistent with $\nu$'s of the ATs driven by the random potential.
Moreover, the critical conductance distribution and the level spacing ratio

available. It is well-known that in classical Nim, the introduction of the pass
alters the underlying structure of the game, significantly increasing its

point trajectories and use it to learn robust estimation of motion
segmentation. A novel neural network architecture is proposed for processing
irregular point trajectory data. Camera poses are then estimated and optimized
with global bundle adjustment over the portion of long-range point trajectories
that are classified as static. Experiments on MPI Sintel dataset show that our
system produces significantly more accurate camera trajectories compared to

reasonable accuracy of camera poses on fully static scenes, which consistently

kernels with a set of neural subnetworks with shared parameters such that every
subnetwork implements the trainable kernel, but the whole network implements
the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. The network memorizes how the feature vectors

correct overall direction of the motion. However, previous works only search
locally to determine a soft correspondence, ignoring the distant points that
turn out to be the actual matching ones. In addition, the estimated
correspondence is usually from the forward direction of the adjacent point

from the backward direction. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel

the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, edge-preservation is often achieved
using Markov random field priors based on heavy-tailed distributions. Another
strategy, popular in statistics, is the application of hierarchical shrinkage
priors. An advantage of this formulation lies in expressing the prior as a
conditionally Gaussian distribution depending of global and local
hyperparameters which are endowed with heavy-tailed hyperpriors. In this work,
we revisit the shrinkage horseshoe prior and introduce its formulation for

pulsational characteristics. We find unresolved g-mode pulsations at
frequencies 1--1.5 d$^{-1}$ in CM Lac, and measure the masses and radii of the
component stars from the TESS data and published radial velocities. MZ Lac
shows a much richer frequency spectrum, including pressure modes and
tidally-excited g-modes. RX Dra is in the northern continuous viewing zone of
TESS so has a light curve covering a full year, but shows relatively few
pulsation frequencies. For V2077 Cyg we formally measure four pulsation
frequencies, but the available data are inadequate to properly resolve the
g-mode pulsations. V2077 Cyg also shows total eclipses, with which we obtain
the first measurement of the surface gravity of the faint secondary star. All
four systems are bright and good candidates for detailed study. Further TESS
observations are scheduled for all four systems, with much improved temporal
baselines in the cases of RX Dra and V2077 Cyg.

roundness is taken into account by the convex envelope of a disk displaced

polydispersity described by a Schultz distribution function. We implemented the
scaled particle theory for this model with the aim to studying: (i) the effect
of roundness on the phase behavior of the one-component hard-rectangle fluid,
and (ii) how polydispersity affects phase transitions between isotropic,
nematic and tetratic phases. We found that roundness greatly affects the
tetratic phase, whose region of stability in the phase diagram strongly
decreases as the roundness parameter is increased. Also the interval of aspect
ratios where the tetratic-nematic and isotropic-nematic phase transitions are
of first order considerably reduces with roundness, both transitions becoming
weaker. Polydispersity induces strong fractionation between the coexisting
phases, with the nematic phase enriched in particles of lower roundness.
Finally, for high enough polydispersity and certain mean aspect ratios, the
isotropic-to-nematic transition can change from second (for the one-component

to provide mechanical support and signal routes between the photosensor and the

Silicon and quartz are two candidates to construct the low background
interposer because of their good radio-purity; nevertheless, it is non-trivial
to produce through silicon vias (TSV) or through quartz vias (TQV) on the large
area silicon or quartz wafer. In this work, based on double-sided TSV
interconnect technology, we developed the first prototype of a silicon

electrical properties of the interposer are carefully evaluated at room

integrated SiPM on the interposer. The testing results reveal quite promising
performance of the prototype, and the single photoelectron signals can be
clearly observed from the SiPM. The features of the observed signals are
comparable with those from the SiPM mounted on a normal FR4-based PCB. Based on
the success of the silicon interposer prototype, we started the follow-up

InfoMax principle, our method learns comprehensive representations by capturing
the intrinsic structure of the data. Specifically, we maximize the mutual
information (MI) of instances and their representations with a low-bias MI
estimator to perform self-supervised pre-training. Rather than supervised
pre-training focusing on the discriminable features of the seen classes, our
self-supervised model has less bias toward the seen classes, resulting in
better generalization for unseen classes. We explain that supervised

performance with various training settings. Surprisingly, the results show that
self-supervised pre-training can outperform supervised pre-training under the

latent space using a linear projection matrix. This way, we create a flexible

pre-trained models, cross-generate data from different domains, and perform
transfer learning between generative models.

layer reverser devices can be achieved using the layer-locked chiral domain

wide range of logics and system types, including quantitative versions where
lower bounds on behavioural distance (e.g.~in weighted, metric, or
probabilistic transition systems) are witnessed by quantitative modal formulas.
Both the qualitative and the quantitative versions have been accommodated
within the framework of coalgebraic logic, with distances taking values in
quantales, subject to certain restrictions, such as being so-called value
quantales. While previous quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorems
apply only to liftings of set functors to (pseudo-)metric spaces, in the
present work we provide a quantitative coalgebraic Hennessy-Milner theorem that
applies more widely to functors native to metric spaces; notably, we thus
cover, for the first time, the well-known Hennessy-Milner theorem for
continuous probabilistic transition systems, where transitions are given by
Borel measures on metric spaces, as an instance. In the process, we also relax
the restrictions imposed on the quantale, and additionally parametrize the
technical account over notions of closure and, hence, density, providing
associated variants of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem; this allows us to cover,
for instance, behavioural ultrametrics.

tools might not be available due to the high uncertainty in far future. To
address this issue, we propose in this paper a self-contained DNA storage

separate storage scheme is developed to reduce the data redundancy while an
effective indexing is designed for random read operations to the stored data

and self-explanatory method can not only get rid of the reliance on external
tools for data restoration but also minimise the data redundancy brought about
when the amount of data to be stored reaches a certain scale.

The NDF is spatially aligned by the underlying reference surface. A neural

novel poses with a detailed and reasonable dynamic appearance. Experiments show
that our method significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

on its deflection angle and gravitational lensing in the equatorial plane of
arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. To do this we developed a
perturbative method that can be applied to spinning signals with arbitrary
asymptotic velocity and takes into account the finite distance effect of the
source and the observer. The deflection angle $\Delta\varphi$ and total travel
time $\Delta t$ are expressed as (quasi-)power series whose coefficients are
polynomials of the asymptotic expansion coefficients of the metric functions.
It is found that when the spin and orbital angular momenta are parallel (or
antiparallel), the deflection angle is decreased (or increased). Apparent
angles $\theta$ of the images in gravitational lensing and their time delays
are also solved. In Kerr spacetime, spin affects the apparent angle $\theta_K$
in a way similar to its effect on $\Delta\varphi_K$. The time delay between
signals with opposite spins is found to be proportional to the signal spin at
leading order. These time delays might be used to constrain the spin to mass
ratio of neutrinos.

completion-time's mean and randomness change. The explicit effect of restart on
the mean is well understood, and it is known that: from a mean perspective,
deterministic restart protocols -- termed sharp restart -- can out-perform any
other restart protocol. However, little is known on the explicit effect of
restart on randomness. This paper is the second in a duo exploring the effect
of sharp restart on randomness: via a Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy analysis
in the first part, and via a diversity analysis in this part. Specifically,
gauging randomness via diversity -- a measure that is intimately related to the
Renyi entropy -- this paper establishes a set of universal criteria that
determine: A) precisely when a sharp-restart protocol decreases/increases the
diversity of completion times; B) the very existence of sharp-restart protocols
that decrease/increase the diversity of completion times. Moreover, addressing
jointly mean-behavior and randomness, this paper asserts and demonstrates when
sharp restart has an aligned effect on the two (decreasing/increasing both),
and when the effect is antithetical (decreasing one while increasing the
other). The joint mean-diversity results require remarkably little information

dust columns, making detection at short wavelengths difficult. In this study
the use of the less extinguished far-red spectrum (8400 -- 8800 \AA ) for
radial velocity measurement is examined. Results are reported for a sample of
164 confirmed OB stars within a 2-degree field positioned on the Carina Arm.
Most stars are at distances between 3 and 6 kpc, and Westerlund 2 is at the
field edge. The measured radial velocities have errors concentrated in the
3--10 km s$^{-1}$ range, with a systematic uncertainty of 2--3 km s$^{-1}$.
These are combined with Gaia-mission astrometry to allow full space motions to
be constructed. Up to 22 stars are likely to be runaways although 8 of them are
as likely to be interloping (so far undetected) binaries. The mean azimuthal
motion of the sample fits in with recent measurements of Galactic disk
rotation. In the Galactocentric radial direction the mean motion indicates
modest infall at a speed of $\sim$ 10 km s$^{-1}$. This experiment shows that
weak Paschen lines in the far-red can yield credible radial velocity
determination, offering the prospect of exploring OB-star kinematics over much
more of the Galactic disk than has hitherto been possible.

malicious clients corrupt the global model via sending manipulated model
updates to the server. Existing defenses mainly rely on Byzantine-robust FL
methods, which aim to learn an accurate global model even if some clients are
malicious. However, they can only resist a small number of malicious clients in
practice. It is still an open challenge how to defend against model poisoning
attacks with a large number of malicious clients. Our FLDetector addresses this
challenge via detecting malicious clients. FLDetector aims to detect and remove
the majority of the malicious clients such that a Byzantine-robust FL method
can learn an accurate global model using the remaining clients. Our key
observation is that, in model poisoning attacks, the model updates from a
client in multiple iterations are inconsistent. Therefore, FLDetector detects
malicious clients via checking their model-updates consistency. Roughly
speaking, the server predicts a client's model update in each iteration based
on its historical model updates using the Cauchy mean value theorem and L-BFGS,
and flags a client as malicious if the received model update from the client
and the predicted model update are inconsistent in multiple iterations. Our
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that FLDetector can
accurately detect malicious clients in multiple state-of-the-art model
poisoning attacks. After removing the detected malicious clients, existing
Byzantine-robust FL methods can learn accurate global models.Our code is

integral of discrete Boltzmann equation in the finite volume framework.
Numerical fluxes at the cell interface related to the macroscopic variables,
stress and heat flux can be reconstructed from the Boltzmann integration
equation at surrounding points of the cell interface directly, so the
complicated partial differential equations with tedious implementation of
boundary conditions in the moment method can be avoided. Meanwhile, the
explicit expression of numerical fluxes is proposed, which could release the
present solver the from the discretization and numerical summation in molecular
velocity space. To evaluate the Grad's distribution function for 13 moments in
the present framework, the G13-MGKS with the discrete and explicit form of
numerical fluxes are examined by several test cases covering the steady and
unsteady rarefied flows. Numerical results indicate that the G13-MGKS could
simulate continuum flows accurately and present reasonable prediction for
rarefied flows at moderate Knudsen number. Moreover, the tests of computations

amplitude and phase fluctuations in a semiconductor laser, and has recently
been shown to be a crucial component for frequency comb formation in addition
to linewidth broadening. It necessarily arises from causality, as famously
formulated by the Kramers-Kronig relation, in media with non-trivial dependence
of the susceptibility on intensity variations. While thermal contributions are
typically slow, and thus can often be excluded by suitably designing the
dynamics of an experiment, the many quantum contributions are harder to
separate. In order to understand and, ultimately, design the LEF to suitable
values for frequency comb formation, soliton generation, or narrow laser
linewidth, it is therefore important to systematically model all these effects.
In this comprehensive work, we introduce a general scheme for computing the
LEF, which we employ with a non-equilibrium Green's function model. This direct
method, based on simulating the system response under varying optical
intensity, and extracting the dependence of the susceptibility to intensity
fluctuations, can include all relevant electronic effects and predicts the LEF
of an operating quantum cascade laser to be in the range of 0.1 - 1, depending
on laser bias and frequency. We also confirm that many-body effects,
off-resonant transitions, dispersive (Bloch) gain, counter-rotating terms,
intensity-dependent transition energy, and precise subband distributions all
significantly contribute and are important for accurate simulations of the LEF.

three-dimensional direct numerical simulations to investigate the heat and salt
fluxes in two-scalar vertical convection. For parameters relevant to ice-ocean
interfaces in the convection-dominated regime, we observe that the salinity
field drives the convection and that heat is essentially transported as a
passive scalar. By varying the diffusivity ratio of heat and salt (i.e., the
Lewis number $Le$), we identify how the different molecular diffusivities
affect the scalar fluxes through the system. Away from the walls, we find that
the heat transport is determined by a turbulent Prandtl number of $Pr_t\approx
1$ and that double-diffusive effects are practically negligible. However, the
difference in molecular diffusivities plays an important role close to the
boundaries. In the (unrealistic) case where salt diffused faster than heat, the
ratio of salt-to-heat fluxes would scale as $Le^{1/3}$, consistent with
classical nested scalar boundary layers. However, in the realistic case of
faster heat diffusion (relative to salt), we observe a transition towards a
$Le^{1/2}$ scaling of the ratio of the fluxes. This coincides with the thermal
boundary layer width growing beyond the thickness of the viscous boundary
layer. We find that this transition is not determined by a critical Lewis
number, but rather by a critical Prandtl number $Pr\approx 10$, slightly below
that for cold seawater where $Pr=14$. We compare our results to similar studies
of sheared and double-diffusive flow under ice shelves, and discuss the
implications for fluxes in large-scale ice-ocean models. By coupling our
results to ice-ocean interface thermodynamics, we describe how the flux ratio
impacts the interfacial salinity, and hence the strength of solutal convection
and the ablation rate.

massless, travel at speeds near the speed of light and are electrically
neutral. Neutrinos can be generated through man-made sources like particle
accelerators or by natural sources like the sun. Neutrinos only interact via
the weak force and gravity. Since gravitational interaction is extremely weak
and the weak force has a very short range, neutrinos can travel long distances
unimpeded through matter, reaching places inaccessible to GNSS (Global
Navigation Satellite System) signals such as underwater locations. The main
objective of this work is to sketch an early high-level design of a Neutrino
PNT (Position, Navigation and Timing) mission and analyze its feasibility for
submarine navigation since there is a need to improve current navigation
technologies for submarines. The high-level preliminary concept proposes
Cyclotrons or Linear Accelerators based on the physical process Pion Decay at
Rest as neutrino sources. For detecting such isotropic neutrino fluxes user
equipment must be composed of a high-performance clock synchronized with the
system, a detector and possibly additional sensors such as IMU (Inertial
Measurement Unit). A feasibility analysis of the recommended system option is
performed based on simulations for determining the neutrino detection rate and
on a PNT tool to estimate the PNT performances. Although the submarine
navigation application is in the limit of being feasible with current
technology, it could be realized with some important but reasonable progress in
source and neutrino detector technology.

mobile users (MUs) aim to reach a consensus on a global model with the help of
a parameter server (PS) that aggregates the local gradients. In OTA FL, MUs
train their models using local data at every training round and transmit their
gradients simultaneously using the same frequency band in an uncoded fashion.
Based on the received signal of the superposed gradients, the PS performs a
global model update. While the OTA FL has a significantly decreased
communication cost, it is susceptible to adverse channel effects and noise.
Employing multiple antennas at the receiver side can reduce these effects, yet
the path-loss is still a limiting factor for users located far away from the
PS. To ameliorate this issue, in this paper, we propose a wireless-based
hierarchical FL scheme that uses intermediate servers (ISs) to form clusters at
the areas where the MUs are more densely located. Our scheme utilizes OTA
cluster aggregations for the communication of the MUs with their corresponding
IS, and OTA global aggregations from the ISs to the PS. We present a
convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm, and show through numerical
evaluations of the derived analytical expressions and experimental results that
utilizing ISs results in a faster convergence and a better performance than the
OTA FL alone while using less transmit power. We also validate the results on
the performance using different number of cluster iterations with different
datasets and data distributions. We conclude that the best choice of cluster
aggregations depends on the data distribution among the MUs and the clusters.

for the simple tasks of classification and regression has received a lot of

complex prediction tasks with structurally dependent variables. This is the
case of multi-label classification and hierarchical multi-label classification
tasks, which may require additional information, possibly coming from the

characterize the properties of the source catalog. We produced a half-sky
eRASS1 simulation, by combining models that truthfully represent the clusters
and AGN. In total, we simulated 1 116 758 clusters and 225 583 320 AGN. We ran
the standard eROSITA detection algorithm. We matched the input and source
catalogs with a photon-based algorithm. We perfectly recovered the bright
sources. We detected half of the AGN brighter than 2e-14 erg/s/cm2 as point
sources and half of the clusters brighter than 3e-13 erg/s/cm2 as extended in
the 0.5-2.0 keV band. We quantified the detection performance in terms of
completeness, false detection rate, and contamination. We studied the source
catalog according to multiple cuts of detection and extension likelihood. We
find that the detection of clusters is mainly driven by flux and exposure. It
depends on secondary effects, such as the size of the clusters and their
dynamical state. The cool core bias mostly affects faint clusters classified as
point sources, while its impact on the extent-selected sample is small. The
measured X-ray luminosity of the detected clusters is compatible with the
simulated values. We discuss how to best build samples of galaxy clusters for
cosmological purposes, accounting for the nonuniform depth of eROSITA. This
simulation provides a digital twin of the real eRASS1.

the navigation of chemical space. The roughness (or smoothness) of these
molecular property landscapes is one of their most studied geometric
attributes, as it can characterize the presence of activity cliffs, with
rougher landscapes generally expected to pose tougher optimization challenges.
Here, we introduce a general, quantitative measure for describing the roughness
of molecular property landscapes. The proposed roughness index (ROGI) is
loosely inspired by the concept of fractal dimension and strongly correlates

Darwinian evolution. Quantum computation is a new computational paradigm which
exploits quantum resources to speed up information processing tasks. Therefore,
it is sensible to explore the potential enhancement in the performance of
genetic algorithms by introducing quantum degrees of freedom. Along this line,
a modular quantum genetic algorithm has recently been proposed, with
individuals encoded in independent registers comprising exchangeable quantum
subroutines [arXiv:2203.15039], which leads to different variants. Here, we
address the numerical benchmarking of these algorithms against classical
genetic algorithms, a comparison missing from previous literature. To overcome
the severe limitations of simulating quantum algorithms, our approach focuses
on measuring the effect of quantum resources on the performance. In order to
isolate the effect of the quantum resources in the performance, the classical
variants have been selected to resemble the fundamental characteristics of the
quantum genetic algorithms. Under these conditions, we encode an optimization
problem in a two-qubit Hamiltonian and face the problem of finding its ground
state. A numerical analysis based on a sample of 200 random cases shows that
some quantum variants outperform all classical ones in convergence speed
towards a near-to-optimal result. Additionally, we have considered a diagonal
Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule to complete the
analysis with two relevant use-cases. If this advantage holds for larger
systems, quantum genetic algorithms would provide a new tool to address
optimization problems with quantum computers.

of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Due to the black-box property and
various types of CAVs, how to test and evaluate CAVs adaptively remains a major
challenge. Many approaches have been proposed to adaptively generate testing
scenarios during the testing process. However, most existing approaches cannot
be applied to complex scenarios, where the variables needed to define such
scenarios are high dimensional. Towards filling this gap, the adaptive testing
with sparse control variates method is proposed in this paper. Instead of
adaptively generating testing scenarios, our approach evaluates CAVs'
performances by adaptively utilizing the testing results. Specifically, each
testing result is adjusted using multiple linear regression techniques based on
control variates. As the regression coefficients can be adaptively optimized
for the CAV under test, using the adjusted results can reduce the estimation
variance, compared with using the testing results directly. To overcome the
high dimensionality challenge, sparse control variates are utilized only for
the critical variables of testing scenarios. To validate the proposed method,
the high-dimensional overtaking scenarios are investigated, and the results
demonstrate that our approach can further accelerate the evaluation process by
about 30 times.

sensitive to the two-photon drive and nonlinearity of the system, and compared
to the previous nonlinearity sensor, the proposed sensor achieves an

Passenger activities in the confined aircraft cabin must be evaluated to
potential virus transmission, and boarding procedures should be designed to
minimize the negative impact on passengers and operations. In our approach, we
generate an optimized seat allocation that considers passengers' physical
activities when they store their hand luggage items in the overhead
compartment. We proposed a mixed-integer programming formulation including the
concept of shedding rates to determine and minimize the risk of virus
transmission by solving the NP-hard seat assignment problem. We are improving
the already efficient outside-in boarding, where passengers in the window seat
board first and passengers in the aisle seat board last, taking into account
COVID-19 regulations and the limited capacity of overhead compartments. To
demonstrate and evaluate the improvements achieved in aircraft boarding, a
stochastic agent-based model is used in which three operational scenarios with
seat occupancy of 50\%, 66\%, and 80\% are implemented. With our optimization
approach, the average boarding time and the transmission risk are significantly
reduced already for the general case, i.e., when no specific boarding order is
specified (random boarding). If the already efficient outside-in boarding is
used as a reference, the boarding time can be reduced by more than 30\% by
applying our approach, while keeping the transmission risk at the lowest level.

axis. Despite the fact that the gravity field is central, the Earth's
trajectory is not closed and the equinoxes drift. Milankovic (1920) argued that
the shortest precession period of solstices is 20,7kyr: the Summer solstice in
one hemisphere takes place alternately every 11kyr at perihelion and at
aphelion. We have submitted the time series for the Earth's pole of rotation,
global mean surface temperature and ephemeris to iterative Singular Spectrum
Analysis. iSSA extracts from each a trend, a 1yr and a 60yr component. Both the
apparent drift of solstices of Earth around the Sun and the global mean
temperature exhibit a strong 60yr oscillation. The ""fixed dates"" of solstices
actually drift. Comparing the time evolution of the Winter and Summer solstices
positions of the rotation pole and the first iSSA component (trend) of the
temperature allows one to recognize some common features. A basic equation from
Milankovic links the derivative of heat received at a given location on Earth
to solar insolation, known functions of the location coordinates, solar
declination and hour angle, with an inverse square dependence on the Sun-Earth
distance. We have translated the drift of solstices as a function of distance
to the Sun into the geometrical insolation theory of Milankovic. Shifting the
inverse square of the 60yr iSSA drift of solstices by 15 years with respect to
the first derivative of the 60yr iSSA trend of temperature, that is exactly a
quadrature in time, puts the two curves in quasi-exact superimposition. The
probability of a chance coincidence appears very low. Correlation does not
imply causality when there is no accompanying model. Here Milankovic's equation
can be considered as a model that is widely accepted. This paper identifies a
case of agreement between observations and a mathematical formulation.

resolving the task poses unique challenges due to subtle visual differences.
Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on the holistic video
representations for score regression or ranking, which limits the
generalization to capture fine-grained intra-class variation. To overcome the
above limitation, we propose a temporal parsing transformer to decompose the
holistic feature into temporal part-level representations. Specifically, we
utilize a set of learnable queries to represent the atomic temporal patterns
for a specific action. Our decoding process converts the frame representations
to a fixed number of temporally ordered part representations. To obtain the
quality score, we adopt the state-of-the-art contrastive regression based on
the part representations. Since existing AQA datasets do not provide temporal
part-level labels or partitions, we propose two novel loss functions on the
cross attention responses of the decoder: a ranking loss to ensure the
learnable queries to satisfy the temporal order in cross attention and a
sparsity loss to encourage the part representations to be more discriminative.

""fractal correction"" $S\propto A^{1+\Delta/2}$ due to quantum gravitational
effects, with $0\leqslant \Delta \leqslant 1$ measures the deviation from the
standard area law. While such a modification has been widely studied in the
literature, its corresponding theory of gravity has not been discussed. We
follow Jacobson's approach to derive the modified gravity theory (interpreted
as an effective theory), and find that in the stationary case the resulting
theory only differs from general relativity by a re-scaled cosmological
constant. Consequently in asymptotically flat stationary spacetimes the theory
is identical to general relativity. The theory is not applicable when there is
no horizon; the multi-horizon case is complicated. We emphasize on the
importance of identifying the correct thermodynamic mass in a theory with
modified thermodynamics to avoid inconsistencies. We also comment on the
Hawking evaporation rate beyond the effective theory. In addition, we show that
the Bekenstein bound is satisfied if the thermodynamic mass is used as the
energy, up to a constant prefactor. We briefly comment on the Tsallis entropy
case as well. Interestingly, for the latter, the requirement that Bekenstein
bound holds imposes a lower bound on the non-extensive parameter: $\delta >
1/2$, which unfortunately rules out the previously suggested possibility that
the expansion of the universe can accelerate with normal matter field alone.

different (positive) temperatures. Nonthermal baths may, however, lead to a
significant performance boost. We here experimentally analyze the power output
of a single-atom quantum Otto engine realized in the quasi-spin states of
individual Cesium atoms interacting with an atomic Rubidium bath. From measured
time-resolved populations of the quasi-spin state, we determine the dynamics
during the cycle of both the effective spin temperature and of the quantum
fluctuations of the engine, which we quantify with the help of the Shannon
entropy. We find that power is enhanced in the negative temperature regime, and
that it reaches its maximum value at half the maximum entropy. Quantitatively,
operating our engine at negative effective temperatures increases the power by
up to 30% compared to operation at positive temperatures, including even the
case of infinite temperature. At the same time, entering the negative
temperature regime allows for reducing the entropy to values close to zero,
offering highly stable operation at high power output. We furthermore
numerically investigate the influence of the size of the Hilbert space on the
performance of the quantum engine by varying the number of levels of the
working medium. Our work thereby paves the way to fluctuation control in the
operation of high-power and efficient single-atom quantum engines.

classes from the source domain to the target domain without any prior knowledge
on the label set, which requires distinguishing in the target domain the
unknown samples from the known ones. Recent methods usually focused on
categorizing a target sample into one of the source classes rather than
distinguishing known and unknown samples, which ignores the inter-sample
affinity between known and unknown samples and may lead to suboptimal
performance. Aiming at this issue, we propose a novel UDA framework where such
inter-sample affinity is exploited. Specifically, we introduce a
knowability-based labeling scheme which can be divided into two steps: 1)
Knowability-guided detection of known and unknown samples based on the
intrinsic structure of the neighborhoods of samples, where we leverage the
first singular vectors of the affinity matrices to obtain the knowability of
every target sample. 2) Label refinement based on neighborhood consistency to
relabel the target samples, where we refine the labels of each target sample
based on its neighborhood consistency of predictions. Then, auxiliary losses
based on the two steps are used to reduce the inter-sample affinity between the
unknown and the known target samples. Finally, experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

purposes by allowing advertisers to select specific users and target them (the
practice is being called micro-targeting). However, advertisers such as
Cambridge Analytica have maliciously used these targeting features to
manipulate users in the context of elections. The European Commission plans to
restrict or ban some targeting functionalities in the new European Democracy
Action Plan act to protect users from such harms. The difficulty is that we do
not know the economic impact of these restrictions on regular advertisers. In
this paper, to inform the debate, we take a first step by understanding who is
advertising on Facebook and how they use the targeting functionalities. For
this, we asked 890 U.S. users to install a monitoring tool on their browsers to
collect the ads they receive on Facebook and information about how these ads
were targeted. By matching advertisers on Facebook with their LinkedIn
profiles, we could see that 71% of advertisers are small and medium-sized
businesses with 200 employees or less, and they are responsible for 61% of ads
and 57% of ad impressions. Regarding micro-targeting, we found that only 32% of
small and medium-sized businesses and 30% of large-sized businesses
micro-target at least one of their ads. These results should not be interpreted
as micro-targeting not being useful as a marketing strategy, but rather that
advertisers prefer to outsource the micro-targeting task to ad platforms.
Indeed, Facebook is employing optimization algorithms that exploit user data to
decide which users should see what ads; which means ad platforms are performing
an algorithmic-driven micro-targeting. Hence, when setting restrictions,
legislators should take into account both the traditional advertiser-driven
micro-targeting as well as algorithmic-driven micro-targeting performed by ad
platforms.

seeking deviations that can manifest the presence of physics beyond the
standard model. These measurements are in general designed for being easily
comparable to any present or future theoretical prediction, and to achieve this
goal it is important to keep the model dependence to a minimum. Nevertheless,
the reduction of the model dependence usually comes at the expense of the
measurement precision, preventing to exploit the full potential of the signal
extraction procedure. In this paper a novel methodology based on the machine
learning concept of domain adaptation is proposed, which allows using a complex
deep neural network in the signal extraction procedure while ensuring a minimal
dependence of the measurements on the theoretical modelling of the signal.

determine the phase coexistence regions by considering the instabilities in the

some spin and lattice rotations become decoupled, leading to considerably
larger symmetry groups than typical magnetic groups. Thus, we provide a

has a strong effect on the splittings observed in the spin excitation spectra.
We further identify a number of self-duality transformations that map the

Machine Learning (ML) binary classification problem of disentangling
prospective DM sources (simulated data) from astrophysical sources (observed

two {\it systematic} features for the DM data which are originally inherent to
observed data: the detection significance and the uncertainty on the spectral

that the DM distributions would, if any, follow the latter. We consider
different ML models: Logistic Regression, Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes and
Gaussian Process, out of which the best, in terms of classification accuracy,
is the NN, achieving around $93.3\% \pm 0.7\%$ performance. Other ML evaluation
parameters, such as the True Negative and True Positive rates, are discussed in

saliency-based block ratio aggregation (BRA) strategy for sampling rate
allocation. A unified learnable generating matrix is then developed to produce
sampling matrix of any CS ratio with an ordered structure. Being equipped with
the optimization-inspired recovery subnet guided by saliency information and a
multi-block training scheme preventing blocking artifacts, CASNet jointly
reconstructs the image blocks sampled at various sampling rates with one single

unstructured environments. To solve this problem, we propose a robot learning
approach to actively interact with novel objects and collect each object's
training label for further fine-tuning to improve the segmentation model
performance, while avoiding the time-consuming process of manually labeling a
dataset. The Singulation-and-Grasping (SaG) policy is trained through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. Given a cluttered pile of objects, our
approach chooses pushing and grasping motions to break the clutter and conducts
object-agnostic grasping for which the SaG policy takes as input the visual
observations and imperfect segmentation. We decompose the problem into three
subtasks: (1) the object singulation subtask aims to separate the objects from
each other, which creates more space that alleviates the difficulty of (2) the
collision-free grasping subtask; (3) the mask generation subtask to obtain the
self-labeled ground truth masks by using an optical flow-based binary
classifier and motion cue post-processing for transfer learning. Our system
achieves 70% singulation success rate in simulated cluttered scenes. The
interactive segmentation of our system achieves 87.8%, 73.9%, and 69.3% average
precision for toy blocks, YCB objects in simulation and real-world novel
objects, respectively, which outperforms several baselines.

trust decisions. Examples are revocation registries and trust status lists. By
introducing distributed ledgers (DLs), it is also possible to create
decentralized registries. A verifier then queries a node of the respective
ledger, e.g., to retrieve trust status information during the verification of a
credential. While this ensures trustworthy information, the process requires
the verifier to be online and the ledger node available. Additionally, the
connection from the verifier to the registry poses a privacy issue, as it leaks
information about the user's behavior.
  In this paper, we resolve these issues by extending existing ledger APIs to
support results that are trustworthy even in an offline setting. We do this by
introducing attestations of the ledger's state, issued by ledger nodes,
aggregatable into a collective attestation by all nodes. This attestation
enables a user to prove the provenance of DL-based data to an offline verifier.
Our approach is generic. So once deployed it serves as a basis for any use case
with an offline verifier. We also provide an implementation for the Ethereum

of the Universe can be constrained by the accurate estimation of time delays
arising in gravitationally lensed systems. We propose TD-CARMA, a Bayesian
method to estimate cosmological time delays by modelling the observed and
irregularly sampled light curves as realizations of a Continuous
Auto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) process. Our model accounts for
heteroskedastic measurement errors and microlensing, an additional source of
independent extrinsic long-term variability in the source brightness. The
semi-separable structure of the CARMA covariance matrix allows for fast and
scalable likelihood computation using Gaussian Process modeling. We obtain a
sample from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using a
nested sampling approach. This allows for ``painless'' Bayesian Computation,
dealing with the expected multi-modality of the posterior distribution in a
straightforward manner and not requiring the specification of starting values
or an initial guess for the time delay, unlike existing methods. In addition,
the proposed sampling procedure automatically evaluates the Bayesian evidence,
allowing us to perform principled Bayesian model selection. TD-CARMA is
parsimonious, and typically includes no more than a dozen unknown parameters.
We apply TD-CARMA to six doubly lensed quasars HS 2209+1914, SDSS J1001+5027,

underlying stellar population. Stochastic fluctuations in the number of ULXs
may allow for equal contributions in the HeII emission, in a fraction of

used in both regression and classification branches of single-stage 2D object
detectors. Recently, several 3D object detection methods adopt IoU-based
optimization and directly replace the 2D IoU with 3D IoU. However, such a
direct computation in 3D is very costly due to the complex implementation and
inefficient backward operations. Moreover, 3D IoU-based optimization is
sub-optimal as it is sensitive to rotation and thus can cause training
instability and detection performance deterioration. In this paper, we propose
a novel Rotation-Decoupled IoU (RDIoU) method that can mitigate the
rotation-sensitivity issue, and produce more efficient optimization objectives
compared with 3D IoU during the training stage. Specifically, our RDIoU
simplifies the complex interactions of regression parameters by decoupling the
rotation variable as an independent term, yet preserving the geometry of 3D
IoU. By incorporating RDIoU into both the regression and classification
branches, the network is encouraged to learn more precise bounding boxes and
concurrently overcome the misalignment issue between classification and

star-forming galaxies. Their powerful ionising radiation and stellar winds
inject a large amount of energy in the interstellar medium. Furthermore,
mass-loss ($\dot{M}$) through radiatively driven winds plays a key role in the
evolution of massive stars. Even so, the wind mass-loss prescriptions used in
stellar evolution models, population synthesis, and stellar feedback models
often disagree with mass-loss rates empirically measured from the UV spectra of
low metallicity massive stars. The most massive young star cluster in the low
metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy is NGC346. This cluster contains more
than half of all O stars discovered in this galaxy so far. A similar age,
metallicity ($Z$), and extinction, the O stars in the NGC346 cluster are
uniquely suited for a comparative study of stellar winds in O stars of
different subtypes. We aim to use a sample of O stars within NGC346 to study
stellar winds at low metallicity. We mapped the central 1"" of NGC346 with the
long-slit UV observations performed by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) on board of the {\em Hubble Space Telescope} and complemented these new
datasets with archival observations. Multi-epoch observations allowed for the
detection of wind variability. The UV dataset was supplemented by optical
spectroscopy and photometry. The resulting spectra were analysed using a
non-local thermal equilibrium model atmosphere code (PoWR) to determine wind
parameters and ionising fluxes. The effective mapping technique allowed us to
obtain a mosaic of almost the full extent of the cluster and resolve stars in
its core. Among hundreds of extracted stellar spectra, 21 belong to O stars.
Nine of them are classified as O stars for the first time. We analyse, in
detail, the UV spectra of 19 O stars... (continued)

testing various physical parameters. Soft robotics is a field that presents
unique physical challenges for simulating its subjects due to the nonlinearity
of deformable material components along with other innovative, and often
complex, physical properties. Because of the computational cost of simulating
soft and heterogeneous objects with traditional techniques, rigid robotics
simulators are not well suited to simulating soft robots. Thus, many engineers
must build their own one-off simulators tailored to their system, or use
existing simulators with reduced performance. In order to facilitate the
development of this exciting technology, this work presents an
interactive-speed, accurate, and versatile simulator for a variety of types of
soft robots. Cronos, our open-source 3D simulation engine, parallelizes a
mass-spring model for ultra-fast performance on both deformable and rigid
objects. Our approach is applicable to a wide array of nonlinear material
configurations, including high deformability, volumetric actuation, or
heterogenous stiffness. This versatility provides the ability to mix materials
and geometric components freely within a single robot simulation. By exploiting
the flexibility and scalability of nonlinear Hookean mass-spring systems, this
framework simulates soft and rigid objects via a highly parallel model for near
real-time speed. We describe an efficient GPU CUDA implementation, which we
demonstrate to achieve computation of over 1 billion elements per second on
consumer-grade GPU cards. Dynamic physical accuracy of the system is validated
by comparing results to Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, natural frequency
predictions, and empirical data of a soft structure under large deformation.

models is to some extent owed to extensive (self-)supervised contrastive
pretraining on large-scale datasets. In contrastive learning, the network is
presented with pairs of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) datapoints
and is trained to find an embedding vector for each datapoint, i.e., a
representation, which can be further fine-tuned for various downstream tasks.
In order to safely deploy these models in critical decision-making systems, it
is crucial to equip them with a measure of their uncertainty or reliability.
However, due to the pairwise nature of training a contrastive model, and the
lack of absolute labels on the output (an abstract embedding vector), adapting
conventional uncertainty estimation techniques to such models is non-trivial.
In this work, we study whether the uncertainty of such a representation can be
quantified for a single datapoint in a meaningful way. In other words, we
explore if the downstream performance on a given datapoint is predictable,
directly from its pre-trained embedding. We show that this goal can be achieved
by directly estimating the distribution of the training data in the embedding
space and accounting for the local consistency of the representations. Our
experiments show that this notion of uncertainty for an embedding vector often
strongly correlates with its downstream accuracy.

devastated area. Here, based on Pudasaini and Krautblatter (2022), I develop a
novel extended landslide velocity model that includes the force induced by the
hydraulic pressure gradient which was neglected by all the existing analytical
landslide velocity models. By a rigorous conversion between this force and
inertia, I develop two peer systems expecting to produce the same results.
However, this contradicts with our conventional wisdom. This raises a question
of whether we should develop some new balance equations. I compare the two
velocity models that neglects and includes the force induced by the hydraulic
pressure gradient. Analytical solutions produced by the two systems are
different. The new model is comprehensive, elegant, and yet an extraordinary
development as it reveals serendipitous circumstances resulting in a
pressure-inertia-paradox. Surprisingly, the mass first moves upstream, then it
winds back and accelerates downslope. The difference between the extended and
simple solution widens strongly as the force associated with the hydraulic
pressure gradient increases, demonstrating its importance. Viscous drag plays
an important role in controlling the landslide dynamics. However, no explicit
mechanical and analytical model exists for this. The careful sagacity of the
graceful form of new velocity equation results in a mechanically extensive,
dynamically evolving analytical model for viscous drag, the first of this kind.
A dimensionless drag number is constructed. Contrary to the prevailing
practices, I have proven that drags are essentially different for the expanding
and contracting motions, an entirely novel perception. Drag coefficients are
close to the often used empirical or numerical values. But, now, I offer an

shifted the methodologies for visual representation learning. In particular,
ViTs learn visual representation at full receptive field per layer across all
the image patches, in comparison to the increasing receptive fields of CNNs
across layers and other alternatives (e.g., large kernels and atrous
convolution). In this work, for the first time we explore the global context
learning potentials of ViTs for dense visual prediction (e.g., semantic
segmentation). Our motivation is that through learning global context at full
receptive field layer by layer, ViTs may capture stronger long-range dependency
information, critical for dense prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that
encoding an image as a sequence of patches, a vanilla ViT without local
convolution and resolution reduction can yield stronger visual representation
for semantic segmentation. For example, our model, termed as SEgmentation
TRansformer (SETR), excels on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU, the first position in the
test leaderboard on the day of submission) and Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU),
and performs competitively on Cityscapes. For tackling general dense visual
prediction tasks in a cost-effective manner, we further formulate a family of
Hierarchical Local-Global (HLG) Transformers, characterized by local attention
within windows and global-attention across windows in a pyramidal architecture.
Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve appealing performance on a
variety of dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection and instance
segmentation and semantic segmentation) as well as image classification. Our

the signal structure is the range of a generative neural network (GNN). The
problem of compressed sensing with GNNs has since been extensively analyzed
when the measurement matrix and/or network weights follow a subgaussian
distribution. We move beyond the subgaussian assumption, to measurement
matrices that are derived by sampling uniformly at random rows of a unitary
matrix (including subsampled Fourier measurements as a special case).
Specifically, we prove the first known restricted isometry guarantee for
generative compressed sensing with subsampled isometries and provide recovery
bounds, addressing an open problem of Scarlett et al. (2022, p. 10). Recovery
efficacy is characterized by the coherence, a new parameter, which measures the
interplay between the range of the network and the measurement matrix. Our
approach relies on subspace counting arguments and ideas central to
high-dimensional probability. Furthermore, we propose a regularization strategy
for training GNNs to have favourable coherence with the measurement operator.
We provide compelling numerical simulations that support this regularized
training strategy: our strategy yields low coherence networks that require
fewer measurements for signal recovery. This, together with our theoretical
results, supports coherence as a natural quantity for characterizing generative
compressed sensing with subsampled isometries.

comprehensive photometric redshift approach, using $10$deg$^2$ of deep
extragalactic legacy fields covered by both HSC and VISTA. The use of template
fitting spanning a wavelength range of $0.3\text{--}2.4\mu$m achieves
$80\text{--}90$ per cent completeness, much higher than classical colour-colour

further extended to $-28.5<M_{\rm UV}<-16$ using complementary results from
other studies, allowing for the simultaneous fitting of the combined AGN and
galaxy LF. We find that there are fewer UV luminous galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}<-22$)
at $z\sim3$ than $z\sim4$, indicative of an onset of widespread quenching
alongside dust obscuration, and that the evolution of the AGN LF is very rapid,
with their number density rising by around 2 orders of magnitude from $3<z<6$.
It remains difficult to determine if a double power law (DPL) functional form
is preferred over the Schechter function to describe the galaxy UV LF.
Estimating the Hydrogen ionizing photon budget from our UV LFs, we find that

However, despite over a decade of active developments of QCL frequency comb
devices, their bandwidth is limited to around $100$ cm$^{-1}$, severely
limiting their application for multi-gas, liquid, and solid sensing. Even
though very broad gain QCLs have been presented, these were not able to improve
the comb bandwidth, whose main limitations are variations of the gain and
dispersion with frequency. A perfectly flat gain spectrum would mitigate this,
as the dispersion as well as the parametric gain necessary to overcome the
losses at gain clamping, vanishes. On the other hand, comb formation rests on
four-wave mixing, a third-order nonlinear process, which is very strong in
QCLs. Due to the subband nature of these devices, this nonlinearity can be
designed and enhanced in order to facilitate comb formation. In this work, we
present optimised designs with broad and flat-top gain spectra spanning as much
as 220 cm$^{-1}$, as well as up to 30 times stronger FWM nonlinearity than a
typical bound-to-continuum QCL design. The optimisation utilises a
nonequilibriumn Green's function model with high predictive power, and obeys
constraints on gain and current density, ensuring efficient devices. Such high
nonlinearity in combination with a moderate, saturable gain, could allow for
non-classical light generation in QCLs. On the other hand, doubling the
spectral bandwidth of QCL combs would be a large step towards high-speed
spectroscopy of complex gas mixtures and liquids.

sampling assumption (FSA) that, in its original form, states that the
collectively postselected statistics are a fair sample of the ideal statistics.
Here, we analyze the FSA from the viewpoint of causal inference: We derive a
causal structure that must be present in any causal model that faithfully
encapsulates the FSA. This provides an easy, intuitive, and unifying approach
that includes different accepted forms of the FSA and underlines what is really
assumed when using the FSA. We then show that the FSA can not only be applied
in scenarios with non-ideal detectors or transmission losses, but also in ideal
experiments where only parts of the correlations are postselected, e.g., when
the particles' destinations are in a superposition state. Finally, we
demonstrate that the FSA is also applicable in multipartite scenarios that test
for (genuine) multipartite nonlocality.

mass when the Standard Model is considered as an effective quantum field
theory. Supersymmetry is the only currently known symmetry which can protect
the Higgs mass while still treating the Higgs as an elementary quantum field.
However in the view of null experimental confirmation from both direct (LHC)
and indirect searches (flavour, dark matter) of the supersymmetric particles
and the constraints from the Higgs mass, several possible heavy spectra for
supersymmetric partners have been proposed.
  In the present thesis, we study the possible origins of these heavy spectra
by considering a considering many sequestered spurion fields as carriers of
supersymmetry breaking. We show that ""natural"" supersymmetric spectrum is
possible in these models and in particular a ""coherent"" scenario leads to low
fine tuning, light Higgsino mixed dark matter ( a la focus point region) even
with heavy supersymmetric spectrum. We then consider this model within the
context of string landscape, where we use the Bousso-Polchinski framework of
four form fluxes to model the spurions. We show that the flavour violating
parameters of supersymmetric spectrum can be ""diluted"" away in the presence of
large number of fluxes.
  One of the possible supersymmetric spectra which emerges by considering all
the data is the generation split (Gensplit) spectrum which allows for flavour
violation to be present for the first two generations, which are heavy. We
study this spectrum within the context of supersymmetric SU(5) and proton
decay. The results are quite interesting and dependent on the proton decay mode
considered. The strongest bound p to k \nu is now modified depending on the
flavour of the neutrino and brings the parameter space within the realms of
upcoming experiments of JUNO, DUNE and Hyper K. These results will be
discussed.

The standard Riemannian stochastic gradient methods for non-compositional

composition optimization, we present a Riemannian Stochastic Composition
Gradient Descent (R-SCGD) method that finds an approximate stationary point,
with expected squared Riemannian gradient smaller than $\epsilon$, in
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ calls to the stochastic gradient oracle of the outer
function and stochastic function and gradient oracles of the inner function.
Furthermore, we generalize the R-SCGD algorithms for problems with multi-level
nested compositional structures, with the same complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$
for the first-order stochastic oracle. Finally, the performance of the R-SCGD
method is numerically evaluated over a policy evaluation problem in

laborious clinical expert assessments. In this paper, we develop a computer
vision based infant symmetry assessment system, leveraging 3D human pose
estimation for infants. Evaluation and calibration of our system against ground
truth assessments is complicated by our findings from a survey of human ratings
of angle and symmetry, that such ratings exhibit low inter-rater reliability.
To rectify this, we develop a Bayesian estimator of the ground truth derived
from a probabilistic graphical model of fallible human raters. We show that the
3D infant pose estimation model can achieve 68% area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve performance in predicting the Bayesian aggregate
labels, compared to only 61% from a 2D infant pose estimation model and 60%
from a 3D adult pose estimation model, highlighting the importance of 3D poses
and infant domain knowledge in assessing infant body symmetry. Our survey
analysis also suggests that human ratings are susceptible to higher levels of
bias and inconsistency, and hence our final 3D pose-based symmetry assessment
system is calibrated but not directly supervised by Bayesian aggregate human
ratings, yielding higher levels of consistency and lower levels of inter-limb
assessment bias.

This model depends only on one free parameter beta=0-1.99. For beta's near
zero, the deviation of the model compared with the Lambda CDM model is tangible
while for values beta=1.99, the suggested model has no conflict with Lambda CDM
theory. Regardless of the value of beta, the model presents dark energy that

for present and near-future Universe treats like the cosmological constant

the results and reducing the uncertainty. Furthermore, this tool has the
characteristic of providing extremely fast responses, essential to identify

neural network, which has been trained to handle different cases, represents
the data-driven model. Firstly, to identify the concentration of the pollutant
at specific observation points in the study area (forward problem); secondly,
to deal with inverse problems identifying the release history at known source

history and, at the same time, the location of the source in a specific

investigated and estimated. The results are satisfactorily achieved,

derived by Fl\""ugge under suitable simplifications. His results are confirmed,
together with all the limit equations, now rigorously obtained, and his theory
is extended. This extension of the theory of buckling of thin shells allows for

hidden treatment effect through a cross network in a multi-task learning
manner. Our method jointly learns the treatment and response functions in the
entire sample space to avoid treatment bias and employs an intermediate pseudo
treatment effect prediction network to relieve sample imbalance. Extensive
experiments are conducted on a synthetic dataset and a large-scaled production
dataset from the E-commerce voucher distribution business. The results indicate
that DESCN can successfully enhance the accuracy of ITE estimation and improve
the uplift ranking performance. A sample of the production dataset and the

increases, great costs are incurred to manage the signatures that are generated
by malicious communication pattern files. Experts in network security need to
classify signatures by importance for an IDPS to work. We propose and evaluate
a machine learning signature classification model with a reject option (RO) to
reduce the cost of setting up an IDPS. To train the proposed model, it is
essential to design features that are effective for signature classification.
Experts classify signatures with predefined if-then rules. An if-then rule
returns a label of low, medium, high, or unknown importance based on keyword
matching of the elements in the signature. Therefore, we first design two types
of features, symbolic features (SFs) and keyword features (KFs), which are used
in keyword matching for the if-then rules. Next, we design web information and
message features (WMFs) to capture the properties of signatures that do not
match the if-then rules. The WMFs are extracted as term frequency-inverse
document frequency (TF-IDF) features of the message text in the signatures. The
features are obtained by web scraping from the referenced external attack
identification systems described in the signature. Because failure needs to be
minimized in the classification of IDPS signatures, as in the medical field, we
consider introducing a RO in our proposed model. The effectiveness of the
proposed classification model is evaluated in experiments with two real
datasets composed of signatures labeled by experts: a dataset that can be
classified with if-then rules and a dataset with elements that do not match an
if-then rule. In the experiment, the proposed model is evaluated. In both
cases, the combined SFs and WMFs performed better than the combined SFs and
KFs. In addition, we also performed feature analysis.

modifies the input sequence by selecting certain vulnerable elements and
substituting them with adversarial items. In both untargeted and targeted
attack scenarios, we observe significant performance deterioration using the
proposed profile pollution algorithm. Motivated by such observations, we design
an efficient adversarial defense method called Dirichlet neighborhood sampling.
Specifically, we sample item embeddings from a convex hull constructed by
multi-hop neighbors to replace the original items in input sequences. During
sampling, a Dirichlet distribution is used to approximate the probability
distribution in the neighborhood such that the recommender learns to combat
local perturbations. Additionally, we design an adversarial training method
tailored for sequential recommender systems. In particular, we represent
selected items with one-hot encodings and perform gradient ascent on the
encodings to search for the worst case linear combination of item embeddings in
training. As such, the embedding function learns robust item representations
and the trained recommender is resistant to test-time adversarial examples.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of both our attack and defense

challenge in building a robust RAN slicing is, therefore, designing a RAN

among slices to map (embed) VNFs onto live substrate nodes. With such
motivation, we propose a machine-learning-powered RAN slicing scheme that aims

disciplines. Typically, this challenge is addressed using side-by-side
comparisons of histograms or density plots. However, comparing multiple density
plots is mentally demanding. Uniform histograms often represent distributions
imprecisely since missing values, outliers, or modes are hidden by a grouping
of equal size. In this paper, a novel type of overview visualization for the
comparison of univariate data distributions is presented: AccuStripes (i.e.,
accumulated stripes) is a new visual metaphor encoding accumulations of data
distributions according to adaptive binning using color coded stripes of
irregular width. We provide detailed insights about challenges of binning.
Specifically, we explore different adaptive binning concepts such as Bayesian
Blocks binning and Jenks Natural Breaks binning for the computation of binning
boundaries, in terms of their capabilities to represent the datasets as
accurately as possible. In addition, we discuss issues arising with the
representation of designs for the comparative visualization of distributions:
To allow for a comparison of many distributions, their accumulated
representations are plotted below each other in a stacked mode. Based on our
findings, we propose three different layouts for comparative visualization of
multiple distributions. The usefulness of AccuStripes is investigated using a
statistical evaluation of the binning methods. Using a similarity metric from
cluster analysis, it is shown, which binning method statistically yields the
best grouping results. Through a user study we evaluate, which binning strategy
visually represents the distribution in the most intuitive form and
investigate, which layout allows the user the comparison of many distributions
in the most effortless way.

modelling to overcome. This work empirically assesses several approaches
utilising machine learning classifiers to detect stress using physiological
data recorded in an ambulatory setting with self-reported stress annotations. A
subset of the training portion SMILE dataset enables the evaluation of
approaches before submission. The optimal stress detection approach achieves
90.77% classification accuracy, 91.24 F1-Score, 90.42 Sensitivity and 91.08
Specificity, utilising an ExtraTrees classifier and feature imputation methods.
Meanwhile, accuracy on the challenge data is much lower at 59.23% (submission
#54 from BEaTS-MTU, username ZacDair). The cause of the performance disparity
is explored in this work.

coordination, and transformation. Mobile apps are becoming an increasingly
important aspect of teaching and learning in many countries. The use of mobile
applications in education is not only beneficial, but also provides students
with an enjoyable and interactive experience. For a mobile product launch to be
as successful as it can be, it is imperative that a systematic, precise,
controlled, and well-established process is in place, which is controlled,
efficient, and well-established. Many educational organisation's find
themselves in situations where they have to get all departments working
effectively and together in order to meet a specific deadline, including
marketing, production, and operations, after the organization's product
clearance board approves the new product. In many ways, the situation is
similar to the software crisis that took place in the middle of the 1970's. As
a result of globalisation and communication, oftentimes the effects of
globalisation are amplified because of the vast amount of information that must
be shared among project team members. Every educational organization has a
unique style and way of doing things, and the project management team is no
exception. As a consequence, it is commonplace to see that every education
entity has its own particular style and way of doing things. In regards to the
creation of a mobile application that is going to function efficiently, it is
important to remember that it is extremely important to stick to the strategies
and requirements that will yield the best results for the education sector.

  CARLA","Paper accepted at IEEE International Conference on Intelligent
  Transportation Systems (IEEE ITSC 2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite recent advances in autonomous driving systems, accidents such as the
fatal Uber crash in 2018 show these systems are still susceptible to edge
cases. Such systems must be thoroughly tested and validated before being
deployed in the real world to avoid such events. Testing in open-world
scenarios can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. These challenges can
be addressed by using driving simulators such as CARLA instead. A key part of
such tests is adversarial testing, in which the goal is to find scenarios that
lead to failures of the given system. While several independent efforts in
testing have been made, a well-established testing framework that enables
adversarial testing has yet to be made available for CARLA. We therefore
propose ANTI-CARLA, an automated testing framework in CARLA for simulating
adversarial weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) and sensor faults (e.g.,
camera occlusion) that fail the system. The operating conditions in which a
given system should be tested are specified in a scenario description language.
The framework offers an efficient search mechanism that searches for
adversarial operating conditions that will fail the tested system. In this way,
ANTI-CARLA extends the CARLA simulator with the capability of performing
adversarial testing on any given driving pipeline. We use ANTI-CARLA to test
the driving pipeline trained with Learning By Cheating (LBC) approach. The
simulation results demonstrate that ANTI-CARLA can effectively and
automatically find a range of failure cases despite LBC reaching an accuracy of
100% in the CARLA benchmark.

an Extremal Index, that informs on the tendency of nearby observations to

We present diverse numerical applications illustrating the theory and discuss

when a shockwave passes through a perturbed interface. Over a thousand
hydrodynamic simulations were performed to study the formation of RMI for a
parameterized high velocity impact. Deep learning was used to learn the
temporal mapping of initial geometric perturbations to the full-field
hydrodynamic solutions of density and velocity. The continuity equation was
used to include physical information into the loss function, however only
resulted in very minor improvements at the cost of additional training
complexity. Predictions from the deep learning model appear to accurately
capture temporal RMI formations for a variety of geometric conditions within
the domain. First principle physical laws were investigated to infer the
accuracy of the model's predictive capability. While the continuity equation
appeared to show no correlation with the accuracy of the model, conservation of
mass and momentum were weakly correlated with accuracy. Since conservation laws
can be quickly calculated from the deep learning model, they may be useful in
applications where a relative accuracy measure is needed.

  Point and Set Classification","6 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The problem of covering random points in a plane with sets of a given shape
has several practical applications in communications and operations research.
One especially prominent application is the coverage of randomly-located points
of interest by randomly-located sensors in a wireless sensor network. In this
article we consider the situation of a large area containing randomly placed
points (representing points of interest), as well a number of randomly-placed
disks of equal radius in the same region (representing individual sensors'
coverage areas). The problem of finding the smallest possible set of disks that
cover the given points is known to be NP-complete. We show that the
computational complexity may be reduced by classifying the disks into several
definite classes that can be characterized as necessary, excludable, or
indeterminate. The problem may then be reduced to considering only the
indeterminate sets and the points that they cover. In addition, indeterminate
sets and the points that they cover may be divided into disjoint ``islands''
that can be solved separately. Hence the actual complexity is determined by the
number of points and sets in the largest island. We run a number of simulations
to show how the proportion of sets and points of various types depend on two
basic scale-invariant parameters related to point and set density. We show that
enormous reductions in complexity can be achieved even in situations where
point and set density is relatively high.

ultracold atoms experiments attempting to approach the thermodynamic limit,
provide evidence of disruption of the antiferromagnetic background with mobile
holes in a slightly doped Hubbard model. The charge correlators reveal the
presence of hole-doublon pairs near half filling and signatures of hole-hole

supports an absolutely continuous physical measure (acpm). We finally show that
