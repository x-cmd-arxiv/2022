  with Infinite Dimensional Decision Spaces","22 pages",,,,"math.OC math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Optimal values and solutions of empirical approximations of stochastic
optimization problems can be viewed as statistical estimators of their true
values. From this perspective, it is important to understand the asymptotic
behavior of these estimators as the sample size goes to infinity, which is both
of theoretical as well as practical interest. This area of study has a long
tradition in stochastic programming. However, the literature is lacking
consistency analysis for problems in which the decision variables are taken
from an infinite-dimensional space, which arise in optimal control, scientific
machine learning, and statistical estimation. By exploiting the typical problem
structures found in these applications that give rise to hidden norm
compactness properties for solution sets, we prove consistency results for
nonconvex risk-averse stochastic optimization problems formulated in
infinite-dimensional space. The proof is based on several crucial results from
the theory of variational convergence. The theoretical results are demonstrated
for several important problem classes arising in the literature.

  Image-Text Matching and Retrieval","CBMI 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image-text matching is gaining a leading role among tasks involving the joint
understanding of vision and language. In literature, this task is often used as
a pre-training objective to forge architectures able to jointly deal with
images and texts. Nonetheless, it has a direct downstream application:
cross-modal retrieval, which consists in finding images related to a given
query text or vice-versa. Solving this task is of critical importance in
cross-modal search engines. Many recent methods proposed effective solutions to
the image-text matching problem, mostly using recent large vision-language (VL)
Transformer networks. However, these models are often computationally
expensive, especially at inference time. This prevents their adoption in
large-scale cross-modal retrieval scenarios, where results should be provided
to the user almost instantaneously. In this paper, we propose to fill in the
gap between effectiveness and efficiency by proposing an ALign And DIstill
Network (ALADIN). ALADIN first produces high-effective scores by aligning at
fine-grained level images and texts. Then, it learns a shared embedding space -
where an efficient kNN search can be performed - by distilling the relevance
scores obtained from the fine-grained alignments. We obtained remarkable
results on MS-COCO, showing that our method can compete with state-of-the-art
VL Transformers while being almost 90 times faster. The code for reproducing
our results is available at https://github.com/mesnico/ALADIN.

  Aim: To identify optimal source-detector distances for Dual-Slope (DS)
measurements in Frequency-Domain (FD) Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) and
demonstrate preferential sensitivity of Dual-Slope (DS) imaging to deeper
tissue (brain) versus superficial tissue (scalp).
  Approach: Theoretical studies (in-silico) based on diffusion theory in
two-layered and in homogeneous scattering media. In-vivo demonstrations of DS
imaging of the human brain during visual stimulation and during systemic blood
pressure oscillations.
  Results: The mean distance (between the two source-detector distances needed
for DS) is the key factor for depth sensitivity. In-vivo imaging of the human
occipital lobe with FD NIRS and a mean distance of 31 mm indicated: (1) greater
hemodynamic response to visual stimulation from FD phase versus intensity, and
from DS versus Single-Distance (SD); (2) hemodynamics from FD phase and DS
mainly driven by blood flow, and hemodynamics from SD intensity mainly driven
by blood volume.
  Conclusions: DS imaging with FD NIRS may suppress confounding contributions
from superficial hemodynamics without relying on data at short source-detector
distances. This capability can have significant implications for non-invasive

quasar NVSS J141922-083830, originally classified as a blazar candidate of

Relatively bright flares (>3 magnitudes) were observed on 21 February 2015 (MJD
57074) and 8 September 2018 (MJD 58369) in the optical band with the MASTER
Global Robotic Net (MASTER-Net) telescopes. Optical spectra obtained with the
Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) on 1 March 2015 (MJD 57082), during
outburst, and on 30 May 2017 (MJD 57903), during quiescence, showed emission
lines at 5325\r{A} and at $\approx$3630\r{A} that we identified as the Mg II
2798\r{A} and C III] 1909\r{A} lines, respectively, and hence derived a

regime (5 years of data) and during four prominent flaring states in
February-April 2014, October-November 2014, February-March 2015 and September
2018. We present spectral and timing analysis with Fermi-LAT. We report a
hardening of the gamma-ray spectrum during the last three flaring periods, with
a power-law spectral index $\Gamma = 2.0$-$2.1$. The maximum gamma-ray flux
level was observed on 24 October 2014 (MJD 56954) at $(7.57 \pm 1.83) \times
10^{-7}$ ph~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The multi-wavelength spectral energy
distribution during the February-March 2015 flare supports the earlier evidence
of this blazar to belong to the FSRQ class. The SED can be well represented
with a single-zone leptonic model with parameters typical of FSRQs, but also a
hadronic origin of the high-energy emission can not be ruled out.

spin. However, producing rapidly spinning ones is extremely difficult as the
stars that produce them lose most of their angular momentum before the BH is
formed. Binaries where the progenitor is paired with a low-mass star in a tight
orbit can produce rapidly spinning BHs (through tides), whereas those with
massive companions cannot (as they do not fit in such an orbit). A few
rapidly-spinning black holes (BHs) have been observed paired with very massive
companion stars, defying stellar-formation paradigm. Models which reduce the
stellar-core--envelope interaction (and winds) do not match observations nor
theory well; I show they also miss explaining the energetics. BH spins cannot
be produced during stellar collapse; using orbital spin through
explosion-fallback material does not match the observations; spinning BHs up
through accepted mass-transfer channels takes longer than their lifetimes, it
is usually discarded. I show that fast mass-transfer mechanisms, predicted to
merge the BH and star, successfully spin the BHs up and show a mechanism to
avoid said mergers and main dangers of the alternatives while naturally
explaining the observations. The implications are potentially paradigm-shifting
and far-reaching in the high-energy, BH astrophysics context.

phase of giant impacts among Moon-to-Mars mass planetary embryos. While the
classic model and its adaptations have produced adequate analogs of the outer
three terrestrial planets, Mercury's origin remains elusive. Mercury's
high-core mass fraction compared to the Earth's is particularly outstanding.
Among collisional hypotheses, this feature has been long interpreted as the
outcome of an energetic giant impact among two massive protoplanets. Here, we
revisit the classical scenario of terrestrial planet formation with focus on
the outcome of giant impacts. We have performed a large number of N-body
simulations considering different initial distributions of planetary embryos
and planetesimals. Our simulations tested the effects of different giant planet
configurations, from virtually circular to very eccentric configurations. We
compare the giant impacts produced in our simulations with those that are more
likely to account for the formation of Mercury and the Moon according to
smoothed hydrodynamic simulations. Impact events that could lead to Moon's
formation are observed in all our simulations with up to ~20% of all giant
impacts, consistent with the range of the expected Moon-forming event
conditions. On the other hand, Mercury-forming events via a single giant impact
are extremely rare, accounting for less than ~1% of all giant impacts. Our
results suggest that producing Mercury as a remnant of a single giant impact
that strips out the mantle of a differentiated planetary object with Earth-like
iron-silicate ratio is challenging and alternative scenarios may be required
(e.g. multiple collisions).

the linear regime, causal and stable dissipative hydrodynamic theories that,
alongside with the usual hydrodynamic modes, also allow for an arbitrary number
of non-hydrodynamic modes with complex dispersion relation (such theories are
often referred to as ""quasi-hydrodynamic""). To increase the number of
non-hydrodynamic modes one needs to add more effective fields to the model. The
system of equations governing this class of quasi-hydrodynamic theories is
symmetric hyperbolic, thermodynamically consistent (i.e. the entropy is a
Lyapunov function) and can be derived from an action principle. As a first
application of the formalism, we prove that, in the linear regime, the
Israel-Stewart theory in the Eckart frame and the Israel-Stewart theory in the
Landau frame are exactly the same theory. In addition, with an Onsager-Casimir
analysis, we show that in strongly coupled plasmas the non-equilibrium degrees
of freedom typically appear in pairs, whose members acquire opposite phase
under time reversal. We use this insight to modify Cattaneo's model for
diffusion, in a way to make its initial transient consistent with the transient
dynamics of holographic plasmas.

accelerate our analysis by using the BACCO linear emulator instead of a
Boltzmann solver. We perform two sets of analyses: one with $3\sigma$ Planck
priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$, and another that is CMB-free, without such priors.
Firstly, we study $\Lambda$CDM, reproducing previous results obtained with the
same estimator. We find a low value of $A_s$ in the CMB-free case, in agreement
with many previous full-shape analyses of the BOSS data. We then study $w$CDM,
finding a lower value of the amplitude in the CMB-free run, coupled with a
preference for phantom dark energy with $w=-1.17^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, again in
broad agreement with previous results. Finally, we investigate the dark
scattering model, which we label $wA$CDM. In the CMB-free analysis, we find a
large degeneracy between the interaction strength $A$ and the amplitude $A_s$,
hampering measurements of those parameters. On the contrary, in our run with a
CMB prior, we are able to constrain the dark energy parameters to be
$w=-0.972^{+0.036}_{-0.029}$ and $A = 3.9^{+3.2}_{-3.7}$, which show a
1$\sigma$ hint of interacting dark energy. This is the first measurement of
this parameter and demonstrates the ability of this model to alleviate the
$\sigma_8$ tension. Our analysis can be used as a guide for any model with
scale-independent growth. Finally, we study the dependence of the results on
the priors of the nuisance parameters and find these priors to be informative,
with their broadening creating shifts in the contours. We argue for an in depth
study of this issue, which can affect current and forthcoming analyses of LSS
data.

challenging. Here, we present the first bulk probe evidence of a Bragg glass
phase in the systematically disordered CDW material Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$ using
comprehensive x-ray data and a novel machine learning data analysis tool, X-ray

to the observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at 95GHz. It is
designed to target degree angular scale polarization patterns, in particular
the very-much-sought-after primordial B-mode signal, which is a unique
signature of cosmic inflation. The polarized signal from the sky is
reconstructed by differencing co-localized, orthogonally polarized
superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers. In this work, we
present absolute measurements of the polarization response of the detectors for
more than $\sim 800$ functioning detector pairs of the BICEP3 experiment, out
of a total of $\sim 1000$. We use a specifically designed Rotating Polarized
Source (RPS) to measure the polarization response at multiple source and
telescope boresight rotation angles, to fully map the response over 360
degrees. We present here polarization properties extracted from on-site
calibration data taken in January 2022. A similar calibration campaign was
performed in 2018, but we found that our constraint was dominated by
systematics on the level of $\sim0.5^\circ$. After a number of improvements to
the calibration set-up, we are now able to report a significantly lower level
of systematic contamination. In the future, such precise measurements will be
used to constrain physics beyond the standard cosmological model, namely cosmic
birefringence.

segmentation annotations. Recently, segmentation-free methods based on
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention mechanism, have
dominated the field of HCTR. However, people actually read text character by
character, especially for ideograms such as Chinese. This raises the question:
are segmentation-free strategies really the best solution to HCTR? To explore
this issue, we propose a new segmentation-based method for recognizing
handwritten Chinese text that is implemented using a simple yet efficient fully
convolutional network. A novel weakly supervised learning method is proposed to
enable the network to be trained using only transcript annotations; thus, the
expensive character segmentation annotations required by previous
segmentation-based methods can be avoided. Owing to the lack of context
modeling in fully convolutional networks, we propose a contextual
regularization method to integrate contextual information into the network
during the training stage, which can further improve the recognition
performance. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmarks,
namely CASIA-HWDB, CASIA-OLHWDB, ICDAR2013, and SCUT-HCCDoc, show that our
method significantly surpasses existing methods on both online and offline

orbit within larger systems, are fundamental to understanding the detailed
distribution of dark matter at the present day. Numerical simulations of
subhalo evolution support the idea that the mass loss associated with tidal
stripping is most naturally understood in energy space, with the particles that
are the least bound being removed first. Starting from this premise, we
recently proposed a zero-parameter ""energy-truncation model"" for subhalo
evolution. We tested this model with simulations of tidal stripping of
satellites with initial NFW profiles, and showed that the energy-truncation
model accurately predicts both the mass loss and density profiles. In this
work, we apply the model to a variety of Hernquist, Einasto and King profiles.
We show that it matches the simulation results quite closely in all cases,
indicating that it may serve as a universal model to describe tidally stripped
collisionless systems. A key prediction of the energy-truncation model is that
the central density of dark matter subhaloes is conserved as they lose mass;
this has important implications for dark matter annihilation calculations, and
for other observational tests of dark matter.

more robust and flexible when dealing with complex layouts including
multi-directional and curved text lines. Utilizing the proposed weakly

annotated for real data; however, it can still output detection and recognition
results at both the character and line levels, avoiding the labor and cost of
labeling bounding boxes of characters and text lines. Extensive experiments
conducted on five datasets demonstrate the superiority of PageNet over existing

function, assuming star formation is 100% efficient and all gas in halos is
converted into stars, and that galaxies are at the peak age for UV emission
(~10 Myr). This upper limit is ~4 orders of magnitude greater than current

halo formation timescales derived from extended Press-Schechter theory as a
proxy for star formation rate (SFR). We predict that the galaxies observed so
far at $z\gtrsim10$ are dominated by those with the fastest formation
timescales, and thus most extreme SFRs and young ages. These galaxies can be
upscattered by ~1.5 mag compared to the median UV magnitude vs halo mass
relation. This likely introduces a selection effect at high redshift whereby
only the youngest ($\lesssim$10 Myr), most highly star forming galaxies
(specific SFR$\gtrsim$30 Gyr$^{-1}$) have been detected so far. Furthermore,
our modelling suggests that redshift evolution at the bright end of the UV
luminosity function is substantially affected by the build-up of dust
attenuation. We predict that deeper JWST observations (reaching m~30) will
reveal more typical galaxies with relatively older ages (~100 Myr) and less

fermion and chiral gauge theory with a generic theta instanton term

analogous puzzle here is the CT or P problem in 1+1d: Why can the

problem can be solved by a Symmetric Mass Generation mechanism (SMG, namely
generating a mass or energy gap while preserving an anomaly-free symmetry).
This 1+1d toy model mimics several features of the 3+1d Standard Model: chiral
matter content, confinement, and Anderson-Higgs-induced mass by Yukawa-Higgs
term. One solution replaces some chiral fermion's Higgs-induced mean-field mass
with SMG-induced non-mean-field mass. Another solution enriches this toy model
by introducing several new physics beyond the Standard Model: a
parity-reflection PR discrete symmetry maps between the chiral and mirror
fermions as fermion doubling localized on two domain walls at high energy, and
SMG dynamically generates mass to the mirror fermion while still preserving the
anomaly-free chiral symmetry at an intermediate energy scale, much before the
Higgs mechanism generates mass to the chiral fermion at lower energy. Without
loss of generality, an arguably simplest 1+1d U(1) symmetric anomaly-free
chiral fermion/gauge theory (e.g., Weyl fermions with $3_L$-$4_L$-$5_R$-$0_R$
U(1) charges) is demonstrated. As an analogy to the superfluid-insulator or
order-disorder quantum phase transition, in contrast to the Peccei-Quinn

analyze the predictions of the TNG50 simulation for the size evolution of

redshift, mass, and angular resolution of the images. We find that the
effective radius accurately describes the three-dimensional half-mass radius of
TNG50 galaxies. Sizes observed at 2~$\mu$m are consistent with those measured
at 3.56~$\mu$m at all redshifts and masses. At all masses, the population of
higher-$z$ galaxies is more compact than their lower-$z$ counterparts. However,
the intrinsic sizes are smaller than the mock observed sizes for the most
massive galaxies, especially at $z \lesssim 4$. This discrepancy between the
mass and light distribution may point to a transition in the galaxy morphology
at $z$=4-5, where massive compact systems start to develop more extended
stellar structures.

two-mode squeezed light, which can be used to herald definite-photon-number

there is loss in the heralding arm or its detector is imperfect. We show that
this paradigm can be used to simultaneously measure distinct loss parameters in

demonstrate this protocol on Xanadu's X8 chip, accessed via the cloud, building
photon-number probability distributions from $10^6$ shots and performing
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) on these distributions $10^3$ independent

simultaneously estimate the actual input power, using the theory of nuisance

Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl specifically designed to predict
rapidly and efficiently, in a full cosmological context, galaxy assembly and
merger histories for any given input stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation.
DECODE generates object-by-object dark matter merger trees (hence discrete)
from accurate subhalo mass and infall redshift probability functions (hence
statistical) for all subhaloes, including those residing within other
subhaloes, with virtually no resolution limits on mass or volume. Merger trees
are then converted into galaxy assembly histories via an input, redshift
dependent SMHM relation, which is highly sensitive to the significant
systematics in the galaxy stellar mass function and on its evolution with
cosmic time. DECODE can accurately reproduce the predicted mean galaxy merger
rates and assembly histories of hydrodynamic simulations and semi-analytic
models, when adopting in input their SMHM relations. In the present work we use
DECODE to prove that only SMHM relations implied by stellar mass functions
characterized by large abundances of massive galaxies and significant redshift
evolution, at least at $M_\star \gtrsim 10^{11} \, M_\odot$, can simultaneously
reproduce the local abundances of satellite galaxies, the galaxy (major merger)
pairs since $z \sim 3$, and the growth of Brightest Cluster Galaxies. The same
models can also reproduce the local fraction of elliptical galaxies, on the
assumption that these are strictly formed by major mergers, but not the full
bulge-to-disc ratio distributions, which require additional processes.

  Patient-independent Seizure Detection in EEG","Submitting to IJNS",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Neurologists typically identify epileptic seizures from electroencephalograms
(EEGs) by visual inspection. This process is often time-consuming, especially
for EEG recordings that last hours or days. To expedite the process, a
reliable, automated, and patient-independent seizure detector is essential.
However, developing a patient-independent seizure detector is challenging as
seizures exhibit diverse characteristics across patients and recording devices.
In this study, we propose a patient-independent seizure detector to
automatically detect seizures in both scalp EEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG).
First, we deploy a convolutional neural network with transformers and belief
matching loss to detect seizures in single-channel EEG segments. Next, we
extract regional features from the channel-level outputs to detect seizures in
multi-channel EEG segments. At last, we apply postprocessing filters to the
segment-level outputs to determine seizures' start and end points in
multi-channel EEGs. Finally, we introduce the minimum overlap evaluation
scoring as an evaluation metric that accounts for minimum overlap between the
detection and seizure, improving upon existing assessment metrics. We trained
the seizure detector on the Temple University Hospital Seizure (TUH-SZ) dataset
and evaluated it on five independent EEG datasets. We evaluate the systems with
the following metrics: sensitivity (SEN), precision (PRE), and average and
median false positive rate per hour (aFPR/h and mFPR/h). Across four adult
scalp EEG and iEEG datasets, we obtained SEN of 0.617-1.00, PRE of 0.534-1.00,
aFPR/h of 0.425-2.002, and mFPR/h of 0-1.003. The proposed seizure detector can
detect seizures in adult EEGs and takes less than 15s for a 30 minutes EEG.
Hence, this system could aid clinicians in reliably identifying seizures
expeditiously, allocating more time for devising proper treatment.

systems displaying unitary dynamics also when the roles of space and time are
exchanged. These systems have recently emerged as a remarkable framework where
certain features of many-body quantum chaos can be studied exactly. In
particular, they admit a class of ``solvable"" initial states for which, in the
thermodynamic limit, one can access the full non-equilibrium dynamics. This
reveals a surprising property: when a dual-unitary circuit is prepared in a
solvable state the quantum entanglement between two complementary spatial
regions grows at the maximal speed allowed by the local structure of the
evolution. Here we investigate the fate of this property when the system is
prepared in a generic pair-product state. We show that in this case the
entanglement increment during a time step is sub-maximal for finite times,
however, it approaches the maximal value in the infinite-time limit. This
statement is proven rigorously for dual-unitary circuits generating high enough

Eventually, one cannot see an increase in paddy yield. Accurate and timely

to the number of scatterers. This decay indicates that the eigenstate

indicator extraction tools, which does not require a manually-built ground

collected reports using multiple tools, and comparing their accuracy.
  GoodFATR supports 6 threat report sources: RSS, Twitter, Telegram, Malpedia,
APTnotes, and ChainSmith. GoodFATR continuously monitors the sources, downloads
new threat reports, extracts 41 indicator types from the collected reports, and
filters non-malicious indicators to output the IOCs. We run GoodFATR over 15
months to collect 472,891 reports from the 6 sources; extract 978,151
indicators from the reports; and identify 618,217 IOCs. We analyze the
collected data to identify the top IOC contributors and the IOC class

get spin polarized after passing through organic chiral molecules in a
nanoscale device. In CISS, chiral molecules are commonly believed to be a spin
filter through which one favored spin transmits and the opposite spin gets
reflected, i.e., transmitted and reflected electrons exhibit opposite spin
polarization. In this work, we point out that such a spin filter scenario
contradicts the principle that equilibrium spin current must vanish. Instead,
we find that both transmitted and reflected electrons present the same type
spin polarization, which is actually ubiquitous for a two-terminal device. More
accurately, chiral molecules play the role of a spin polarizer rather than a
spin filter. The direction of spin polarization is determined by the molecule
chirality and the electron incident direction. And the magnitude of spin
polarization replies on local spin-orbit coupling in the device. Our work
brings a deeper understanding on CISS and interprets recent experiments, for
example, the CISS-driven anomalous Hall effect.

and how, while taking into account risks, costs and other complexities.
  Objective: This study aims to empirically investigate objectives and
complexities organizations need to consider and balance between when deciding
on what software to share as OSS, when to share it, and whether to create a new

  Method: A multiple-case study of three case organizations was conducted in
two research cycles, with data gathered from interviews with 20 practitioners
from these organizations. The data was analyzed qualitatively in an inductive
and iterative coding process.
  Results: 12 contribution objectives and 15 contribution complexities were
found. Objectives include opportunities for improving reputation, managing
suppliers, managing partners and competitors, and exploiting externally
available knowledge and resources. Complexities include risk of loosing

  Conclusions: Cross-case analysis and interview validation show that the
identified objectives and complexities offer organizations a possibility to

This is usually addressed by animating a neutral 3D face to reach an expression
peak, and then get back to the neutral state. In the real world though, people
show more complex expressions, and switch from one expression to another. We
thus propose a new model that generates transitions between different
expressions, and synthesizes long and composed 4D expressions. This involves
three sub-problems: (i) modeling the temporal dynamics of expressions, (ii)
learning transitions between them, and (iii) deforming a generic mesh. We
propose to encode the temporal evolution of expressions using the motion of a
set of 3D landmarks, that we learn to generate by training a manifold-valued
GAN (Motion3DGAN). To allow the generation of composed expressions, this model
accepts two labels encoding the starting and the ending expressions. The final
sequence of meshes is generated by a Sparse2Dense mesh Decoder (S2D-Dec) that
maps the landmark displacements to a dense, per-vertex displacement of a known
mesh topology. By explicitly working with motion trajectories, the model is
totally independent from the identity. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets show that our proposed approach brings significant improvements with
respect to previous solutions, while retaining good generalization to unseen

for applications that require resiliency to extreme temperature (>2000{\deg}C),

transition metal carbides as standalone materials using additive manufacturing
(AM) methods has not been fully realized due to their extremely slow atomic
diffusivities that impede sintering and large volume changes during indirect AM
that can induce defect structures. In this work, a two-step, reactive AM
approach was studied for the formation of the ultra-high temperature ceramic
TiCx. Readily available equipment including a polymer powder bed fusion AM
machine and a traditional tube furnace were used to produce UHTC cubes and
lattice structures with sub-millimeter resolution. This processing scheme
incorporated, (1) selective laser sintering of a Ti precursor mixed with a
phenolic binder for green body shaping, and (2) ex-situ, isothermal gas-solid
conversion of the green body in CH4 to form TiCx structures. Reactive
post-processing in CH4 resulted in up to 98.2 wt% TiC0.90 product yield and a
reduction in net-shrinkage during consolidation due to the volume expansion
associated with the conversion of Ti to TiC. Results indicated that reaction
bonding associated with the Gibbs free energy release associated with TiC
formation produced interparticle adhesion at low furnace processing
temperatures. The ability to bond highly refractory materials through this type
of process resulted in structures that were crack-free and resisted fracture
during thermal shock testing. Broadly, the additive manufacturing approach
presented could be useful for the production of many UHTC carbides that might
otherwise be incompatible with prevailing AM techniques that do not include

However, this approach requires a large number of simulations when
investigating a large composition phase space. In addition, there is difficulty
in predicting whether each simulation is yielding biomolecular materials with
the desired properties or outcomes and how long each simulation will run for.
These difficulties can be overcome by rules-based management systems which
include intermittent inspection, variable sampling, premature termination and
extension of the individual Molecular Dynamics simulations. The automation of
such a management system can significantly reduce the overhead of managing
large ensembles of Molecular Dynamics simulations. To this end, a
high-throughput workflows-based computational framework, Pipeline for
Automating Compliance-based Elimination and Extension (PACE2), for biomolecular
materials simulations is proposed. The PACE2 framework encompasses
Simulation-Analysis Pipelines. Each Pipeline includes temporally separated
simulation and analysis tasks. When a Molecular Dynamics simulation completes,
an analysis task is triggered which evaluates the Molecular Dynamics trajectory
for compliance. Compliant Molecular Dynamics simulations are extended to the
next Molecular Dynamics phase with a suitable sample rate to allow additional,
detailed analysis. Non-compliant Molecular Dynamics simulations are eliminated,
and their computational resources are either reallocated or released. The
framework is designed to run on local desktop computers and high performance
computing resources. In the future, the framework will be extended to address
generalized workflows and investigate other classes of materials.

Wigner/friend gedanken experiment to argue that quantum mechanics cannot
describe complex systems involving measuring agents. They produced a
contradictory statement starting with 4 statements about measurements performed
on an entangled spin system. These statements were combined using the
transitive property of logic: If A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C.
However, in combining successive statements for the Frauchiger-Renner gedanken
experiment we show that quantum mechanics does not obey transitivity and that
this invalidates their analysis. We also demonstrate that certain pairs of
premises among the four statements are logically incompatible, meaning that
they cannot all be used at once. To produce the contradiction, Frauchiger and
Renner choose a particular run, which they call the 'OK'-'OKbar' one. However,
the restriction to this case invalidates 3 of the 4 statements. Thus, there are
3 separate problems with logic in the 2018 publication. We also demonstrate the
violation of the rules of logic - including transitivity - in certain
situations in quantum mechanics in general. We use the Frauchiger-Renner
gedanken experiment as a laboratory to explore wavefunction logic,
Wigner/friend experiments, and the deduction of mathematical statements from
knowledge of a wavefunction and obtain a number of interesting results. We show
that Wigner/friend experiments of the type used by Frauchiger and Renner are
impossible if the Wigner measurements are performed on macroscopic objects.
They are possible on certain microscopic entities but then the Wigner
measurements are rendered ""ordinary"" (such as measurements on a spin), in which
case it is straightforward to perform the Frauchiger-Renner experiment in a
real laboratory setting.

automatic speech recognition (ASR). It converts numbers, dates, abbreviations,
and other semiotic classes from the spoken form generated by ASR to their
written forms. One can consider ITN as a Machine Translation task and use
neural sequence-to-sequence models to solve it. Unfortunately, such neural
models are prone to hallucinations that could lead to unacceptable errors. To
mitigate this issue, we propose a single-pass token classifier model that
regards ITN as a tagging task. The model assigns a replacement fragment to
every input token or marks it for deletion or copying without changes. We
present a dataset preparation method based on the granular alignment of ITN
examples. The proposed model is less prone to hallucination errors. The model
is trained on the Google Text Normalization dataset and achieves
state-of-the-art sentence accuracy on both English and Russian test sets.
One-to-one correspondence between tags and input words improves the
interpretability of the model's predictions, simplifies debugging, and allows
for post-processing corrections. The model is simpler than sequence-to-sequence
models and easier to optimize in production settings. The model and the code to
prepare the dataset is published as part of NeMo project.

dot is present in each device, (ii) dot nucleation proceeds without the
formation of a wetting layer, and (iii) the sidewalls of the photonic nanowire

be described by an independent Boson model that considers both deformation and

systems by reducing the unnecessary degrees of freedom of the fine-grained (FG)
system while recapitulating major structural correlations. Unlike structural
properties, assessing dynamic properties in CG modeling is often unfeasible due
to the accelerated dynamics of the CG models, which allows for more efficient
structural sampling. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the present series of
articles is to establish a better correspondence between the FG and CG
dynamics. To assess and compare dynamical properties in the FG and the
corresponding CG models, we utilize the excess entropy scaling relationship.
For Paper I of this series, we provide evidence that the FG and the
corresponding CG counterpart follow the same universal scaling relationship. By
carefully reviewing and examining the literature, we develop a new theory to
calculate excess entropies for the FG and CG systems while accounting for
entropy representability. We demonstrate that the excess entropy scaling idea
can be readily applied to liquid water and methanol systems at both the FG and
CG resolutions. For both liquids, we reveal that the scaling exponents remain
unchanged from the coarse-graining process, indicating that the scaling
behavior is universal for the same underlying molecular systems. Combining this
finding with the concept of mapping entropy in CG models, we show that the
missing entropy plays an important role in accelerating the CG dynamics.

ideas and reinforcement learning (RL), enables the agent to adapt to different
tasks using a few samples. However, this sampling-based adaptation also makes
meta RL vulnerable to adversarial attacks. By manipulating the reward feedback
from sampling processes in meta RL, an attacker can mislead the agent into
building wrong knowledge from training experience, which deteriorates the
agent's performance when dealing with different tasks after adaptation. This
paper provides a game-theoretical underpinning for understanding this type of
security risk. In particular, we formally define the sampling attack model as a
Stackelberg game between the attacker and the agent, which yields a minimax
formulation. It leads to two online attack schemes: Intermittent Attack and
Persistent Attack, which enable the attacker to learn an optimal sampling
attack, defined by an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point, within
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. These attack schemes freeride the
learning progress concurrently without extra interactions with the environment.
By corroborating the convergence results with numerical experiments, we observe
that a minor effort of the attacker can significantly deteriorate the learning
performance, and the minimax approach can also help robustify the meta RL
algorithms.

Converter stations (VSC-MTDC) is expected to be one of the most important
contributors to the future of electric power systems. In fact, among other
features, it has already been shown how this technology can contribute to
improve transient stability in power systems by the use of supplementary
controllers. Along this line, this paper will investigate in detail how these
supplementary controllers may affect electromechanical oscillations, by means
of small-signal stability analysis. The paper analyses two control strategies
based on the modulation of active-power injections (P-WAF) and reactive-power
injections (Q-WAF) in the VSC stations. Both control strategies use global
signals of the frequencies of the VSC-MTDC system and they presented
significant improvements on transient stability. The paper will provide
guidelines for the design of these type of controllers to improve both, large-
and small-disturbance angle stability. Small-signal stability techniques (in
Matlab) will be used to assess electromechanical-oscillation damping, while
non-linear time domain simulation (in PSS/E) will be used to confirm the
results. Results will be illustrated in Nordic32A test system with an embedded
VSC-MTDC system. The paper analyses the impact of the controller gains and
communication latency on electromechanical-oscillation damping. The main
conclusion of the paper is that transient-stability-tailored supplementary
controllers in VSC-MTDC systems can be tuned to damp inter-area oscillations
too, maintaining their effectiveness for transient-stability improvement.

over a mMIMO flat fading channel. The proposed scheme greatly outperforms the

optimization algorithms for OIL by analyzing one of the most popular OIL
algorithms, DAGGER. Specifically, if the class of policies is sufficiently
expressive to contain the expert policy, we prove that DAGGER achieves constant
regret. Unlike previous bounds that require the losses to be strongly-convex,
our result only requires the weaker assumption that the losses be
strongly-convex with respect to the policy's sufficient statistics (not its
parameterization). In order to ensure convergence for a wider class of policies
and losses, we augment DAGGER with an additional regularization term. In
particular, we propose a variant of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and
its adaptive variant for OIL and develop a memory-efficient implementation,
which matches the memory requirements of FTL. Assuming that the loss functions
are smooth and convex with respect to the parameters of the policy, we also
prove that FTRL achieves constant regret for any sufficiently expressive policy

priors/constraints, data augmentation, or implicit reasoning, they still fail
to generalize to unseen poses or occlusion cases and may make large mistakes
when multiple people are present. Inspired by the remarkable ability of humans
to infer occluded joints from visible cues, we develop a method to explicitly
model this process that significantly improves bottom-up multi-person human
pose estimation with or without occlusions. First, we split the task into two
subtasks: visible keypoints detection and occluded keypoints reasoning, and
propose a Deeply Supervised Encoder Distillation (DSED) network to solve the
second one. To train our model, we propose a Skeleton-guided human Shape
Fitting (SSF) approach to generate pseudo occlusion labels on the existing

explicitly learning from occlusions improves human pose estimation. In
addition, exploiting feature-level information of visible joints allows us to
reason about occluded joints more accurately. Our method outperforms both the

X-ray binaries (BH LMXBs) are still largely unknown. In this paper we present
the first quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray detection in quiescence of the BH
LMXB MAXI J1348$-$630, which is known to display a hybrid disk/jet connection
that depends on the accretion rate. We performed deep X-ray and radio
observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Australia Telescope
Compact Array. MAXI J1348$-$630 is detected for the first time in quiescence at
an X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X} = (7.5 \pm 2.9) \times 10^{30} (D/2.2 \ {\rm

quiescent BH LMXB, possibly implying a short orbital period for the system.
MAXI J1348$-$630 is also detected in radio at $L_{\rm R} = (4.3 \pm 0.9) \times
10^{26} (D/2.2 \ {\rm kpc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$. These detections allow us to
constrain the location of MAXI J1348$-$630 on the radio/X-ray diagram in
quiescence, finding that the source belongs to the standard (radio-loud) track
in this phase. This provides a strong confirmation that hybrid-correlation
sources follow the standard track at low luminosities and down to quiescence,
thus improving our knowledge of the disk/jet connection in BH LMXBs.

with the subsequent even one in the 22-year Hale solar cycle was found. It is
shown that 3 years before the 11-year minimum $m$, the value of the relative
sunspot number SN in an odd cycle is closely related to the value of the
maximum in the next even cycle (correlation coefficient $\rho=0.94$), and the
same relation of an odd cycle with the previous even one is weaker. Like GOR,
cycles are linked in pairs, but opposite to the Rule.
  Based on this result, we propose to use SN$_{m-3}$ on the descending phase of
the previous odd cycle as a precursor of the subsequent EVEN cycle (Figure 3a)
-- a precursor called MI3E. For the prediction of an odd cycle or a prediction
without consideration of parity (as in the article by Braj\v{s}a et al., 2022),
this method gives less reliable results.
  To predict the amplitude of an ODD cycle, we propose to use the precursor of
the seventh year to its maximum $M$ MA7O -- SN$_{M-7}$ on the descending phase
of the previous even cycle (Figure 3b). It turned out that in this case, we can
also predict the years near the maximum with a high correlation coefficient
($\rho=0.90{-}0.94$).
  Thus, the proposed approaches allow us to predict cycles of different parity.
According to our prediction, the current solar Cycle 25 in 2023 will reach a
maximum of 154 units with a prediction error of $\pm25$ (68% confidence) and
$\pm53$ (95% confidence). In 2024, SN will be almost as high as in 2023 -- 147
units, so with smaller time averaging scales, the maximum will fall at the end
of 2023.

investigated by combining the nuclear structure and reaction calculations for
the analysis of Sn(p,p) reactions at 295 MeV. The Sn(p,p) reactions were
calculated employing relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) with theoretical
densities obtained for the Sn isotopes from relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov
(RHB) calculations with the DD-ME2 interaction and nonrelativistic Skyrme
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (SHFB) calculations with the SKM* interaction.
Calculation using the DD-ME2 density reproduced the experimental data for
$^{122}$Sn(p,p) but overestimated the $^{116}$Sn(p,p) and $^{118}$Sn(p,p) cross
sections at backward angles. In the isotopic analysis of the cross section
ratio $R(\sigma)$ of $^{122}$Sn to $^{116}$Sn, a calculation using the SKM*
density reproduced the peak amplitudes of $R(\sigma)$ obtained from the
experimental cross sections, whereas a calculation using the DD-ME2 density did
not. The ratio $R(\sigma)$ was found to be sensitive to the isotopic change of
the neutron $3s_{1/2}$ occupation through the isotopic difference of the
surface neutron density around r=4--5 fm. Isotopic analysis indicated that a
rapid increase of the $3s_{1/2}$ occupation from $^{116}$Sn to $^{122}$Sn
obtained by the DD-ME2 calculation is unlikely. This result derived from the
295 MeV Sn(p,p) cross section data is consistent with the direct measurement of
the neutron occupations in Sn isotopes by neutron transfer and pick-up
reactions.

merging binaries from the observed gravitational wave signals through Bayesian
inference. Although we have access to a large collection of signal models that
are sufficiently accurate to infer the properties of black holes, for some
signals, small discrepancies in the models lead to systematic differences in
the inferred properties. In order to provide a single estimate for the
properties of the black holes, it is preferable to marginalize over the model
uncertainty. Bayesian model averaging is a commonly used technique to
marginalize over multiple models, however, it is computationally expensive. An
elegant solution is to simultaneously infer the model and model properties in a
joint Bayesian analysis. In this work we demonstrate that a joint Bayesian
analysis can not only accelerate but also account for model-dependent
systematic differences in the inferred black hole properties. We verify this
technique by analysing 100 randomly chosen simulated signals and also the real
gravitational wave signal GW200129_065458. We find that not only do we infer
statistically identical properties as those obtained using Bayesian model
averaging, but we can sample over a set of three models on average $2.5\times$
faster. In other words, a joint Bayesian analysis that marginalizes over three
models takes on average only $20\%$ more time than a single model analysis. We
then demonstrate that this technique can be used to accurately and efficiently
quantify the support for one model over another, thereby assisting in Bayesian
model selection.

identifying and fixing performance issues. This is especially important in high
performance computing contexts where even minor performance tweaks can
translate into large savings in terms of computational resource use. To aid
performance analysis, developers may collect an execution trace - a
chronological log of program activity during execution. As traces represent the
full history, developers can discover a wide array of possibly previously
unknown performance issues, making them an important artifact for exploratory
performance analysis. However, interactive trace visualization is difficult due
to issues of data size and complexity of meaning. Traces represent
nanosecond-level events across many parallel processes, meaning the collected
data is often large and difficult to explore. The rise of asynchronous task
parallel programming paradigms complicates the relation between events and
their probable cause. To address these challenges, we conduct a continuing
design study in collaboration with high performance computing researchers. We
develop diverse and hierarchical ways to navigate and represent execution trace
data in support of their trace analysis tasks. Through an iterative design
process, we developed Traveler, an integrated visualization platform for task
parallel traces. Traveler provides multiple linked interfaces to help navigate
trace data from multiple contexts. We evaluate the utility of Traveler through
feedback from users and a case study, finding that integrating multiple modes
of navigation in our design supported performance analysis tasks and led to the
discovery of previously unknown behavior in a distributed array library.

they are believed to be important in the context of coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration. We present an observational study on a sequence of jets with
the data acquired with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). This sequence is peculiar in that an EUV
jet, $\sim29\arcsec$ long and with a dome-like base, appears to be a
consequence of a series of transition region (TR) micro-jets that are a few
arcsecs in length.We find that the occurrence of any TR micro-jets is always
associated with the change of geometry of micro-loops at the footpoints of the
microjets. A bundle of TR flux ropes is seen to link a TR micro-jet to the
dome-like structure at the base of the EUV jet. This bundle rises as a response
to the TR micro-jets, with the rising motion eventually triggering the EUV jet.
We propose a scenario involving a set of magnetic reconnections, in which the
series of TR micro-jets are associated with the processes to remove the
constraints to the TR flux ropes and thus allow them to rise and trigger the
EUV jet. Our study demonstrates that small-scale dynamics in the lower solar
atmosphere are crucial in understanding the energy and mass connection between
the corona and the solar lower atmosphere, even though many of them might not
pump mass and energy to the corona directly.

is inspired by recent PIFu-style methods for 3D reconstruction, enables
reasoning about the whole object, including its (self-)occluded parts. For a 3D

fully-connected neural network to predict: (i) the corresponding 3D object
coordinates, and (ii) the signed distance to the object surface, with the first

realized by this network as Neural Correspondence Field. The object pose is
then robustly estimated from the predicted 3D-3D correspondences by the

non-randomized observational studies for estimating the average treatment
effect. An important assumption underlying this approach is that all
confounders that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome of
interest are measured and included in the propensity score model. In the
absence of strong prior knowledge about potential confounders, researchers may
agnostically want to adjust for a high-dimensional set of pre-treatment
variables. As such, variable selection procedure is needed for propensity score
estimation. In addition, recent studies show that including variables related
to treatment only in the propensity score model may inflate the variance of the
treatment effect estimates, while including variables that are predictive of
only the outcome can improve efficiency. In this paper, we propose a flexible
approach to incorporating outcome-covariate relationship in the propensity
score model by including the predicted binary outcome probability (OP) as a
covariate. Our approach can be easily adapted to an ensemble of variable
selection methods, including regularization methods and modern machine learning
tools based on classification and regression trees. We evaluate our method to
estimate the treatment effects on a binary outcome, which is possibly censored,

21.78$^\circ$ is stable at 100 K with a larger bulk gap than the tbG. The
non-trivial topological indicators, including the real Chern number and a

an effective four band tight-binding model capturing the topology and

semantically similar data into nearby embedding space and plays a vital role in
many applications, such as image retrieval and face recognition. However, the
performance of DML methods often highly depends on sampling methods to choose
effective data from the embedding space in the training. In practice, the
embeddings in the embedding space are obtained by some deep models, where the
embedding space is often with barren area due to the absence of training
points, resulting in so called ""missing embedding"" issue. This issue may impair
the sample quality, which leads to degenerated DML performance. In this work,
we investigate how to alleviate the ""missing embedding"" issue to improve the
sampling quality and achieve effective DML. To this end, we propose a
Densely-Anchored Sampling (DAS) scheme that considers the embedding with
corresponding data point as ""anchor"" and exploits the anchor's nearby embedding
space to densely produce embeddings without data points. Specifically, we
propose to exploit the embedding space around single anchor with Discriminative
Feature Scaling (DFS) and multiple anchors with Memorized Transformation
Shifting (MTS). In this way, by combing the embeddings with and without data
points, we are able to provide more embeddings to facilitate the sampling
process thus boosting the performance of DML. Our method is effortlessly
integrated into existing DML frameworks and improves them without bells and

superiority of our method.

polynomial $P(x)= \sum_{i\leq m} p_i(x)^d$ with component $p_i$s. The case of
linear $p_i$s is equivalent to the well-studied tensor decomposition problem
while the quadratic case occurs naturally in studying identifiability of
non-spherical Gaussian mixtures from low-order moments.
  Unlike tensor decomposition, both the unique identifiability and algorithms
for this problem are not well-understood. For the simplest setting of quadratic
$p_i$s and $d=3$, prior work of Ge, Huang and Kakade yields an algorithm only
when $m \leq \tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. On the other hand, the more general recent
result of Garg, Kayal and Saha builds an algebraic approach to handle any
$m=n^{O(1)}$ components but only when $d$ is large enough (while yielding no
bounds for $d=3$ or even $d=100$) and only handles an inverse exponential
noise.
  Our results obtain a substantial quantitative improvement on both the prior
works above even in the base case of $d=3$ and quadratic $p_i$s. Specifically,
our algorithm succeeds in decomposing a sum of $m \sim \tilde{O}(n)$ generic
quadratic $p_i$s for $d=3$ and more generally the $d$th power-sum of $m \sim
n^{2d/15}$ generic degree-$K$ polynomials for any $K \geq 2$. Our algorithm
relies only on basic numerical linear algebraic primitives, is exact (i.e.,
obtain arbitrarily tiny error up to numerical precision), and handles an
inverse polynomial noise when the $p_i$s have random Gaussian coefficients.
  Our main tool is a new method for extracting the linear span of $p_i$s by
studying the linear subspace of low-order partial derivatives of the input $P$.
For establishing polynomial stability of our algorithm in average-case, we
prove inverse polynomial bounds on the smallest singular value of certain
correlated random matrices with low-degree polynomial entries that arise in our
analyses.

However, existing calibration methods cannot do this well due to the model
identifiability problem. This paper proposes a semi-parametric model, called

present numerical simulations of relativistic jets propagating through a
massive, stripped envelope star associated to long GRBs, breaking out of the
star and accelerating into the circumstellar medium. We compute the
gravitational wave (GW) signal resulting from the propagation of the jet
through the star and the circumstellar medium. We show that key parameters of
the jet propagation can be directly determined by the GW signal. The signal
presents a first peak corresponding to the jet duration and a second peak which
corresponds to the break-out time for an observer located close to the jet axis
(which in turn depends on the stellar size), or to much larger times
(corresponding to the end of the acceleration phase) for off-axis observers. We
also show that the slope of the GW signal before and around the first peak
tracks the jet luminosity history and the structure of the progenitor star. The
amplitude of the GW signal is $h_+D \sim$ hundreds to several thousands cm.
Although this signal, for extragalactic sources, is outside the range of
detectability of current GW detectors, it can be detected by future instruments
as BBO, DECIGO and ALIA. Our results illustrate that future detections of GW
associated to GRB jets may represent a revolution in our understanding of this

forecast selection due to its ability to mitigate the uncertainty associated
with identifying a single ""best"" forecast. Nonetheless, sophisticated
combinations are often empirically dominated by simple averaging, which is
commonly attributed to the weight estimation error. The issue becomes more
problematic when dealing with a forecast pool containing a large number of
individual forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecast trimming
algorithm to identify an optimal subset from the original forecast pool for
forecast combination tasks. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed
algorithm simultaneously takes into account the robustness, accuracy and
diversity issues of the forecast pool, rather than isolating each one of these
issues. We also develop five forecast trimming algorithms as benchmarks,
including one trimming-free algorithm and several trimming algorithms that
isolate each one of the three key issues. Experimental results show that our
algorithm achieves superior forecasting performance in general in terms of both
point forecasts and prediction intervals. Nevertheless, we argue that diversity
does not always have to be addressed in forecast trimming. Based on the
results, we offer some practical guidelines on the selection of forecast
trimming algorithms for a target series.

frames.In this paper, we present a novel Shadow-Consistent Correspondence
method (SC-Cor) to enhance pixel-wise similarity of the specific shadow regions

advantages. Firstly, without requiring the dense pixel-to-pixel correspondence
labels, SC-Cor can learn the pixel-wise correspondence across frames in a
weakly-supervised manner. Secondly, SC-Cor considers intra-shadow separability,
which is robust to the variant textures and illuminations in videos. Finally,
SC-Cor is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into existing

process is about 1250 days. The epoch when the dissipation process stopped and
the reformation period began is estimated to be around MJD 58530. We find a
delay of about 100 to 200 days between the minimum of the optical or infrared
intensity and the strength of the Halpha line after the X-ray outburst, which
may indicate that the dissipation of the disk begins from the inner parts. The
motion of the density perturbation inside the disk is prograde, with a V/R
quasi-period of about four years. The source shows a positive correlation in
the (B-V) color index versus V-band magnitude diagram, which implies that the
system is seen at a small or moderate inclination angle.

analysis by defining certain local features and vector representations of nodes
and then using them to learn globally defined metrics and properties of the
nodes by means of deep neural networks. By extending the notion of the degree
of a node via Breath-First Search, a general family of {\bf parametric
centrality functions} is defined which are able to reveal the importance of
nodes. We introduce the {\bf neighbors degree frequency (NDF)}, as a locally
defined embedding of nodes of undirected graphs into euclidean spaces. This
gives rise to a vectorized labeling of nodes which encodes the structure of
local neighborhoods of nodes and can be used for graph isomorphism testing. We
add flexibility to our construction so that it can handle dynamic graphs as
well. Afterwards, the Breadth-First Search is used to extend NDF vector
representations into two different matrix representations of nodes which
contain higher order information about the neighborhoods of nodes. Our matrix
representations of nodes provide us with a new way of visualizing the shape of
the neighborhood of a node. Furthermore, we use these matrix representations to
obtain feature vectors, which are suitable for typical deep learning
algorithms. To demonstrate these node embeddings actually contain some
information about the nodes, in a series of examples, we show that PageRank and
closeness centrality can be learned by applying deep learning to these local
features. Our constructions are flexible enough to handle evolving graphs.
Finally, we explain how to adapt our constructions for directed graphs.

drive it's target pest population extinct, if supplemented with high quality
additional food of quantity $\xi > \xi_{critical}$, \cite{SP11, SPV18, SPD17,
SPM13}. We show this approach leads to infinite time blow-up of the predator

predator competition. Analysis herein indicates that there are threshold values
$c^{*}_{1} < c^{*}_{2} < c^{*}_{3}$ of the competition parameter $c$, s.t. when
$c < c^{*}_{1}$, the pest free state is globally stable, when $c^{*}_{2} < c <
c^{*}_{3}$, bi-stability is possible, and when $c^{*}_{3} < c$, up to three
interior equilibriums could exist. As $c$ and $\xi$-$c$ are varied, standard
co-dimension one and co-dimension two bifurcations are observed. The recent
dynamical systems literature involving predator competition, report several
non-standard bifurcations such as the saddle-node-transcritical bifurcation
(SNTC) occurring in co-dimension two \cite{KSV10, BS07}, and cusp-transcritical
bifurcation (CPTC) in co-dimension three, \cite{D20, BS07}. We show that in our
model structural symmetries can be exploited to construct a SNTC in
co-dimension two, and a CPTC also in co-dimension two. We further use these
symmetries to construct a novel pitchfork-transcritical bifurcation (PTC) in
co-dimension two, thus explicitly characterizing a new organizing center of the
model. Dynamics such as homoclinic orbits, concurrently occurring limit cycles,
and competition driven Turing patterns are also observed. Our findings indicate
that increasing additional food in predator-pest models, can hinder
bio-control, contrary to some of the literature. However, additional food that
also induces predator competition, leads to novel bio-control scenarios, and
complements the work in \cite{H21, B98, K04, D20, BS07, VH19}.

exploitation defined by the dispersion of action distribution. However, this
balance depends on the task, the current stage of the learning process, and the
current environment state. Existing methods that designate the action
distribution dispersion require problem-dependent hyperparameters. In this
paper, we propose to automatically designate the action distribution dispersion
using the following principle: This distribution should have sufficient
dispersion to enable the evaluation of future policies. To that end, the
dispersion should be tuned to assure a sufficiently high probability
(densities) of the actions in the replay buffer and the modes of the
distributions that generated them, yet this dispersion should not be higher.
This way, a policy can be effectively evaluated based on the actions in the
buffer, but exploratory randomness in actions decreases when this policy
converges. The above principle is verified here on challenging benchmarks Ant,
HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2D, with good results. Our method makes the
action standard deviations converge to values similar to those resulting from
trial-and-error optimization.

cost and critical functions for robotic tasks such as localization, mapping and
obstacle detection. Supervised approaches have led to great success with the
advance of deep learning, but they rely on large quantities of ground-truth
depth annotations that are expensive to acquire. Unsupervised domain adaptation
(UDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data, so
as to relax the constraint of supervised learning. However, existing UDA
approaches may not completely align the domain gap across different datasets
because of the domain shift problem. We believe better domain alignment can be
achieved via well-designed feature decomposition. In this paper, we propose a
novel UDA method for MDE, referred to as Learning Feature Decomposition for
Adaptation (LFDA), which learns to decompose the feature space into content and
style components. LFDA only attempts to align the content component since it
has a smaller domain gap. Meanwhile, it excludes the style component which is
specific to the source domain from training the primary task. Furthermore, LFDA
uses separate feature distribution estimations to further bridge the domain
gap. Extensive experiments on three domain adaptative MDE scenarios show that
the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and lower computational cost
compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

first averaging is performed over the Gibbs canonical state of the heat bath

$P_k(\omega)$. We analyze this result further, and also demonstrate its
consistency in the weak-coupling limit. Following this, we compute the
equilibrium magnetic moment of the system, and reveal an interesting connection
with the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem. The expressions

superposition whose amplitudes are greater than a specified threshold;
probability filtering is defined analogously for probabilities. Given the
scarcity of qubits, the focus of this work is to design log-space algorithms
for them. Both algorithms follow a similar pattern of estimating the amplitude
(or, probability for the latter problem) of each state, in superposition, then
comparing each estimate against the threshold for setting up a flag qubit upon
success, finally followed by amplitude amplification of states in which the
flag is set. We show how to implement each step using very few qubits by
designing three subroutines. Our first algorithm performs amplitude
amplification even when the ""good state'' operator has a small probability of
being incorrect -- here we improve upon the space complexity of the previously
known algorithms. Our second algorithm performs ""true amplitude estimation'' in
roughly the same complexity as that of ""amplitude estimation'', which actually
estimates a probability instead of an amplitude. Our third algorithm is for
performing amplitude estimation in parallel (superposition) which is difficult
when each estimation branch involves different oracles. As an immediate reward,
we observed that the above algorithms for the filtering problems directly
improved the upper bounds on the space-bounded query complexity of problems

Quantized Distilled Low Rank Neural Radiance Field (QDLR-NeRF) representation.
While existing compression methods encode the set of light field sub-aperture
images, our proposed method instead learns an implicit scene representation in
the form of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which also enables view synthesis.
For reducing its size, the model is first learned under a Low Rank (LR)
constraint using a Tensor Train (TT) decomposition in an Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. To further reduce the
model size, the components of the tensor train decomposition need to be
quantized. However, performing the optimization of the NeRF model by
simultaneously taking the low rank constraint and the rate-constrained weight
quantization into consideration is challenging. To deal with this difficulty,
we introduce a network distillation operation that separates the low rank
approximation and the weight quantization in the network training. The
information from the initial LR constrained NeRF (LR-NeRF) is distilled to a
model of a much smaller dimension (DLR-NeRF) based on the TT decomposition of
the LR-NeRF. An optimized global codebook is then learned to quantize all TT
components, producing the final QDLRNeRF. Experimental results show that our
proposed method yields better compression efficiency compared with
state-of-the-art methods, and it additionally has the advantage of allowing the
synthesis of any light field view with a high quality.

observed in the multicyclic chains, but not in the monocyclic chains. This
topological transition drastically changes the stress of the rings. Although
the topological transition was also observed in asymmetric-multicyclic/linear

of fetoscopic procedures may contribute to surgical training without putting

a pure spin current is generated in the alpha-NPD layer with the spin pumping
driven by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The generated spin current is absorbed
into the Pd layer, and converted into a charge current with the inverse

for the spin transport in an alpha-NPD film. The spin diffusion length in an

the gravitational fields generated by a G\""odel-type Som-Raychaudhuri (SR)
cosmic string spacetime on KG-oscillators (KG-particles in general) are studied
and reported. In so doing, we revisit the KG-oscillators in a topologically
trivial G\""odel-type spacetime background and use textbook procedures to report
its exact solution that covers even and odd parities. Next, we discuss the
drawbacks associated with the power series expansion approach that implies the
biconfluent Heun functions/polynomials solution. We, therefore, recollect the
so called pseudo perturbative shifted L expansion technique (PSLET) as an
alternative and more sophisticated method/technique. Illustrative examples are
used: (i) a KG-oscillator in a topologically trivial G\""odel-type spacetime,
(ii) a quasi-free KG-oscillator in G\""odel SR-type cosmic string spacetime,
(iii) a KG-Coulombic particle in G\""odel SR-type cosmic string spacetime at
zero vorticity, and (iv) a massless KG-particle in G\""odel SR-type cosmic
string spacetime in a Cornell-type Lorentz scalar potential. The corresponding
exact energies are obtained from the zeroth (leading) order correction of
PSLET, where all higher order correction identically vanish. The comprehensive
exactness of the reported solutions manifestly suggest degeneracies associated
with spacetime (STAD) phenomenon.

dynamics, where governing dynamic equations consist of heterogenous equations
that are switched depending on the state of the system. Legged robots and
manipulator robots experience contact-noncontact discrete transitions, causing
switching of governing equations. Analysis of these robot systems have been a
challenge due to the lack of a global, unified model that is amenable to
analysis of the global behaviors. Composition operator theory has the potential
to provide a global, unified representation of those heterogenous dynamical
systems. It is expected that, if the theory is applicable, those fundamentally
challenging robotics systems can be treated as linear dynamical systems in a
lifted space. The current work addresses under which conditions a unified
linear representation exists in a global sense for a class of heterogenous
dynamical systems and how the theory can be applied to those robotics problems.
First, a kernel representation of composition operators is obtained, and
conditions required for converting the kernel representation to a linear state
transition equation are established. This analysis results in an algorithm to
convert a class of heterogenous systems including hybrid and switched systems
directly to a global, unified linear model. Unlike prevalent data-driven
methods and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, where results can vary depending on
numerical data, the proposed method does not require numerical simulation of
the original dynamics. The implication of the new method and its impact upon
robotics are discussed. A few examples validate and demonstrate the method.

compactifications understood in a broad sense. In the first half of the thesis,
we will begin by reviewing the four-dimensional description of the tree-level
perturbative type IIB action. We will then review a number of open questions in
cosmology and their relevance with regards to the remainder of the thesis. We
will first explore some of these cosmological questions from the perspective of
effective field theories motivated by supergravity. From the naturalness of
dark energy and how to obtain a naturally light dark energy field in terms of
the clockwork mechanism and the Dvali-Kaloper-Sorbo four-form mixing. We also
discuss the coincidence problem for dynamical models of dark energy consistent
with a quintessence field slowly rolling down a potential slope, of the type
one would expect from the asymptotics of moduli space.
  In the second half of the thesis, we introduce the effects of perturbative
and non-perturbative corrections to the tree-level type IIB action. We then
focus on obtaining a viable model of quintessence from the type IIB effective
field theory. However, we are able to show that such a model must have a
non-supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum at leading order. When we consider the
effects of quantum fluctuations during the early Universe, we see that such
models must have extremely fine-tuned initial conditions to describe a
slow-rolling scalar field at present times. We conclude that quintessence faces
more challenges than a true cosmological constant, to the point that
quintessence is very unattractive for model building modulo a ruling out of the
cosmological constant by observations. Following this line of reasoning, we
consider whether other perturbative corrections can generate de Sitter

fundamental differences. A skyrmion wall prefers areas with a weaker exchange
stiffness, a larger DMI constant, or a smaller magnetic anisotropy while a
skyrmion core experiences only the magnetic anisotropy, not exchange stiffness
and DMI. Depending on disk type, skyrmion type, and the relative size of the
disk (to skyrmion), a skyrmion can be pinned at the symmetric (center) or
asymmetric (off-center) point of a disk. In case a skyrmion is pinned by a
local energy minimum, thermal agitation can depin the skyrmion, and the pinning
lifetime follows an Arrhenius law. Interestingly, when the disk size is
comparable to the skyrmion size, the skyrmion deforms greatly such that the
skyrmion will shrink or expand to fill the whole disk. These findings should be
important for skyrmion manipulations.

trading activity changed around the Covid-19 lockdown period (March 9 - May 19,
2020) and more generally in the period of the pandemic. The results pinpoint
that the lockdown restriction was accompanied by a surge in interest toward
stock market, as testified by the trading volume by households. Given the
generically falling prices during the lockdown, the households, which are
typically contrarian, were net buyers, even if less than expected from their
trading activity in 2019. This can be explained by the arrival, during the
lockdown, of a group of about 185k new investors (i.e. which had never traded
since January 2019) which were on average ten year younger and with a larger
fraction of males than the pre-lockdown investors. By looking at the gross P&L,
there is clear evidence that these new investors were more skilled in trading.
There are thus indications that the lockdown, and more generally the Covid
pandemic, created a sort of regime change in the population of financial
investors.

data summarization, web search, and recommender systems. Given a set $X$ of $n$
elements, it asks to select a subset $S$ of $k \ll n$ elements with maximum
\emph{diversity}, as quantified by the dissimilarities among the elements in
$S$. In this paper, we focus on the diversity maximization problem with
fairness constraints in the streaming setting. Specifically, we consider the
max-min diversity objective, which selects a subset $S$ that maximizes the
minimum distance (dissimilarity) between any pair of distinct elements within
it. Assuming that the set $X$ is partitioned into $m$ disjoint groups by some
sensitive attribute, e.g., sex or race, ensuring \emph{fairness} requires that
the selected subset $S$ contains $k_i$ elements from each group $i \in [1,m]$.
A streaming algorithm should process $X$ sequentially in one pass and return a
subset with maximum \emph{diversity} while guaranteeing the fairness
constraint. Although diversity maximization has been extensively studied, the
only known algorithms that can work with the max-min diversity objective and
fairness constraints are very inefficient for data streams. Since diversity
maximization is NP-hard in general, we propose two approximation algorithms for
fair diversity maximization in data streams, the first of which is
$\frac{1-\varepsilon}{4}$-approximate and specific for $m=2$, where
$\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, and the second of which achieves a
$\frac{1-\varepsilon}{3m+2}$-approximation for an arbitrary $m$. Experimental
results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that both algorithms provide
solutions of comparable quality to the state-of-the-art algorithms while
running several orders of magnitude faster in the streaming setting.

representation learning, a compressed representation of the experimental
pedestal electron density and temperature profiles is established. By
conditioning the representation with machine control parameters, a
probabilistic generative predictive model is established. For prediction, the
machine parameters can be used to establish a conditional distribution of the
compressed pedestal profiles, and the decoder that is trained as part of the
algorithm can be used to decode the compressed representation back to full
pedestal profiles. Although, in this work, a proof-of-principle for predicting

uniform Kruskal theorem. On the one hand, this variant still implies
$\Pi^1_1$-comprehension over $\mathsf{RCA}_0+\mathsf{CAC}$. On the other hand,
it becomes weak when $\mathsf{CAC}$ is removed from the base theory.

the close relationship between the petrochemical industry's smoke emission and
its safety production and environmental damage. There are several production
situations in the real industrial production environment, including complete
combustion of exhaust gas, inadequate combustion of exhaust gas, direct
emission of exhaust gas, etc. We discovered that the datasets used in previous
research work can only determine whether smoke is present or not, not its type.
That is, the dataset's category does not map to the real-world production
situations, which are not conducive to the precise regulation of the production
system. As a result, we created a multi-categories smoke detection database
that includes a total of 70196 images. We further employed multiple models to
conduct the experiment on the proposed database, the results show that the
performance of the current algorithms needs to be improved and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed database.

collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission
by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. The GDR3 catalogue
contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes,
and broad band photometry in the G, G$_{BP}$, and G$_{RP}$ pass-bands already
present in the Early Third Data Release. GDR3 introduces an impressive wealth
of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges $G_{rvs} < 14$
and $3100 <T_{eff} <14500 $, have new determinations of their mean radial
velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide G$_{rvs}$ magnitudes for
most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed
for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community.
The GDR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial
velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism
photometer BPRP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry
are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. GDR3
includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470
million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and
quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some $800\,000$
astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than $150\,000$ Solar
System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions
and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra
derived from the epoch BPRP spectral data are published for about 60\,000
asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia

will cause privacy leakage if not carefully protected. To mitigate privacy
risks, current works primarily utilize non-invertible transformations or fully
cryptographic algorithms. However, transformation-based methods usually fail to
achieve satisfying matching performances while cryptosystems suffer from heavy

be improved to confront potential adversary attacks. To address these issues,
this paper proposes a plug-in module called SecureVector that protects features
by random permutations, 4L-DEC converting and existing homomorphic encryption
techniques. For the first time, SecureVector achieves real-time and lossless
feature matching among sanitized features, along with much higher security
levels than current state-of-the-arts. Extensive experiments on face

region proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class
correlation among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization

we design Meta-DETR, which (i) is the first image-level few-shot detector, and
(ii) introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to

capture the inter-class correlation among different classes, thus significantly
reducing the misclassification over similar classes and enhancing knowledge
generalization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot object

techniques that can be used to gain knowledge about properties of unknown

different black-box optimizers on 30 HPO problems, which consist of two-,
three- and five-dimensional continuous search spaces of the XGBoost learner
trained on 10 different data sets. This is contrasted with the performance of
the same optimizers evaluated on 360 problem instances from the black-box

problems and examine similarities and differences. A cluster analysis of the
HPO and BBOB problems in ELA feature space allows us to identify how the HPO
problems compare to the BBOB problems on a structural meta-level. We identify a

wireless networks. However, contemporary clock skew estimation is based on
inaccurate transmission time measurement, which makes credible estimation
challenging. Based on one-way broadcast synchronization, this study presents a
novel maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with an innovative implementation to
minimize the clock skew estimation error caused by delay. A multiple one-way
broadcast model is developed for observation and set collection, while the
distribution of actual delay is discussed. A clock skew MLE based on Gaussian
delay is then proposed and its Cramer-Rao lower bound provided. The developed
MLE is independent of the clock offset estimation, and requires only two
synchronization periods to generate an accurate estimation. Extensive
experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed MLE is
better than the methods popularly used in existing time synchronization
protocols.

continuously, capture precise geometry of the surrounding environment and are
crucial to many autonomous detection and navigation tasks. Though many 3D deep
architectures have been developed, efficient collection and annotation of large
amounts of point clouds remain one major challenge in the analytic and
understanding of point cloud data. This paper presents PolarMix, a point cloud
augmentation technique that is simple and generic but can mitigate the data
constraint effectively across different perception tasks and scenarios.
PolarMix enriches point cloud distributions and preserves point cloud fidelity
via two cross-scan augmentation strategies that cut, edit, and mix point clouds
along the scanning direction. The first is scene-level swapping which exchanges
point cloud sectors of two LiDAR scans that are cut along the azimuth axis. The
second is instance-level rotation and paste which crops point instances from
one LiDAR scan, rotates them by multiple angles (to create multiple copies),
and paste the rotated point instances into other scans. Extensive experiments
show that PolarMix achieves superior performance consistently across different
perception tasks and scenarios. In addition, it can work as plug-and-play for
various 3D deep architectures and also performs well for unsupervised domain
adaptation.

radiation-induced effects in various applications, from dosimetry and

Learning (EML) algorithm was developed to predict electronic stopping power for
any incident ion and target combination over a wide range of ion energies. For
this purpose, five ML models, namely BR, XGB, AdB, GB, and RF, were selected as
base and meta learners to construct the final Stacking EML. Methods: 40,044
experimental measurements, from 1928 to the present, available on the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website were used to train machine
learning (ML) algorithms. This database consists of 593 ion-target combinations
across the energy range of 0.037 to 985 MeV. For model training, the eleven
most important features were selected. The model evaluation was performed using
several error metrics, including R-squared (R2), root-mean-squared-error
(RMSE), mean-absolute-error (MAE), and mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE),
on both the training and test datasets. Results: Based on model performance
evaluation tests, a stack of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Random Forest
(RF) via Bagging Regressor (BR) meta-learner had the highest lowest error
margin. The value of R2=0.9985 indicated a near-ideal fit to all samples in the
training data across the entire range of stopping powers. R2=0.9955 for
predictions made by the model on the unseen test data suggested that the model
accurately predicted the test data. Conclusions: The developed model resulted
in highly accurate predictions for any ion-target combination across the whole
particle energy spectrum. The associated model can serve as a universal tool to
generate the stopping power data in a wide range of cases, regardless of the
availability of experimental data or reliable theoretical equations.

e.g., MS MARCO and NLI, where the base model is continuingly trained based on

Natural Questions, and the sentence embeddings' quality for standard STS and

large-scale software applications. To satisfy such requirements, caching is
often used at various levels and infrastructure layers. Application-level
caching -- or memoization -- is an increasingly used form of caching within the
application boundaries, which consists of storing the results of computations
in memory to avoid re-computing them. This is typically manually done by
developers, who identify caching opportunities in the code and write additional
code to manage the cache content. The task of identifying caching opportunities
is a challenge because it requires the analysis of workloads and code locations
where it is feasible and beneficial to cache objects. To aid developers in this
task, there are approaches that automatically identify cacheable methods.
Although such approaches have been individually evaluated, their effectiveness
has not been compared. We thus in this paper present an empirical evaluation to
compare the method recommendations made by the two existing application-level
caching approaches at the method level, namely APLCache and MemoizeIt, using
seven open-source web applications. We analyse the recommendations made by each
approach as well as the hits, misses and throughput achieved with their valid
caching recommendations. Our results show that the effectiveness of both
approaches largely depends on the specific application, the presence of invalid
recommendations and additional configurations, such as the time-to-live. By
inspecting the obtained results, we observed in which cases the recommendations
of each approach fail and succeed, which allowed us to derive a set of seven
lessons learned that give directions for future approaches to support
developers in the adoption of this type of caching.

forward-looking sonar is a well-known problem in the field of underwater
robotics. There are works attempting to retrieve 3D information from a single
image which allows the robot to generate 3D maps with fly-through motion.
However, owing to the unique image formulation principle, estimating 3D
information from a single image faces severe ambiguity problems. Classical
methods of multi-view stereo can avoid the ambiguity problems, but may require
a large number of viewpoints to generate an accurate model. In this work, we
propose a novel learning-based multi-view stereo method to estimate 3D
information. To better utilize the information from multiple frames, an
elevation plane sweeping method is proposed to generate the
depth-azimuth-elevation cost volume. The volume after regularization can be
considered as a probabilistic volumetric representation of the target. Instead
of performing regression on the elevation angles, we use pseudo front depth
from the cost volume to represent the 3D information which can avoid the 2D-3D
problem in acoustic imaging. High-accuracy results can be generated with only
two or three images. Synthetic datasets were generated to simulate various
underwater targets. We also built the first real dataset with accurate ground

superiority of our method, compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

security bound in quantum cryptographic applications, such as quantum random
number generation (QRNG) and quantum key distribution (QKD). All security
proofs derive a relation between the information accessible to the legitimate
group and the maximum knowledge that an adversary may have gained, Eve, which
exploits entropic uncertainty relations to lower bound Eve's uncertainty about
the raw key generated by one party, Alice. The standard entropic uncertainty
relations is to utilize the smooth min- and max-entropies to show these
cryptographic applications' security by computing the overlap of two
incompatible measurements or positive-operator valued measures (POVMs). This
paper draws one case of the POVM-versioned standard entropic uncertainty
relation yielding the trivial bound since the maximum overlap in POVMs always
produces the trivial value, ""one."" So, it fails to tie the smooth min-entropy

modulation in heap flows can create well-segregated layers, which effectively
mix the deposited material normal to the free surface at lengths greater than
the combined layer-thickness. This mitigates the strong streamwise segregation
that would otherwise occur at larger particle-size ratios and equivalent steady
feed rates and can significantly reduce concentration variation during hopper
discharge. Coupling segregation, deposition and erosion is challenging but has

can be done indirectly by observing the major components, such as NH3 and CH3OH
at cm wavelengths, once they are released into the gas-phase during the warm
protostellar stage. We observed several CH3OH and NH3 lines toward three Class
0 protostars in NGC1333 (IRAS 4A1, IRAS 4A2, and IRAS 4B), at high angular
resolution (1""; ~300 au) with the VLA interferometer at 24-26 GHz. Using a
non-LTE LVG analysis, we derived a similar NH3/CH3OH abundance ratio in the
three protostars (<0.5, 0.015-0.5, and 0.003-0.3 for IRAS 4A1, 4A2, and 4B,
respectively). Hence, we infer they were born from pre-collapse material with

astrochemical model predictions, we constrained the dust temperature at the

temperature of the southern NGC 1333 diffuse cloud. We suggest that a brutal
event started the collapse that eventually formed IRAS 4A1, 4A2 and 4B,

can lead to inefficient learning, or even prevent the algorithm from ever
learning an optimal policy, even with infinite data. In this work we develop an
online algorithm that uses a Bayesian hypothesis testing approach to learn the
nature of the environment. Our algorithm allows practitioners to incorporate
prior knowledge about whether the environment is that of a CB or an MDP, and
effectively interpolate between classical CB and MDP-based algorithms to
mitigate against the effects of misspecifying the environment. We perform
simulations and demonstrate that in CB settings our algorithm achieves lower
regret than MDP-based algorithms, while in non-bandit MDP settings our
algorithm is able to learn the optimal policy, often achieving comparable
regret to MDP-based algorithms.

and the random model. As the number of layers increases, the performance
improvement of EMA over EM decreases. The inferred multiplex networks can be
leveraged to inform the decision-making on monitoring covert networks as well
as allocating limited resources for collecting additional information to
improve reconstruction accuracy. For law enforcement agencies, the inferred
complete network structure can be used to develop more effective strategies for
covert network interdiction.

have formulated electronic self-energy interaction with acoustic and polar

Feynman's diagrammatic techniques to investigate combined electronic transport.
Furthermore, the aforementioned can readily expand for the three and four
phonon interactions on choice based upon the particular class of organic
semiconductor crystal and organic polymers for the modern organic device

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) currently receive a lot of interest in the
literature. Despite the large body of existing works, however, one of their
core features has never been quantified in detail, namely their physical
unclonability. This paper tackles this fundamental and yet largely unaddressed
issue. In simulations and/or experiments, the sensitivity of diffraction-based
optical responses is investigated with respect to various small alterations
such as variation in the position, size, and number of the scatterers, as well
as perturbations in the spatial alignment between the physical unclonable
function (PUF) and the measurement apparatus. Our analysis focuses on 2D
optical PUFs because of their relevance in integrated applications and the need
to reply to security concerns that can be raised when the physical structure of
the geometry is accessible. Among the results of this study, the sensitivity
analysis shows that a positional perturbation of scatterers on the order of
\SI{30}{\nano\meter}, i.e., far below the wavelength of the probing laser light
of \SI{632}{\nano\meter} wavelength, is sufficient to invalidate the PUF
response and thus detect a forgery attempt. These results support and quantify
the high adversarial efforts required to clone optical PUFs, even for 2D
layouts.

  Requirements in Meritocratic Open Source Software Communities?",,,"10.1016/j.infsof.2019.04.010",,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context: In the Requirements Engineering (RE) process of an Open Source
Software (OSS) community, an involved firm is a stakeholder among many.
Conflicting agendas may create miss-alignment with the firm's internal
requirements strategy. In communities with meritocratic governance or with
aspects thereof, a firm has the opportunity to affect the RE process in line
with their own agenda by gaining influence through active and symbiotic
engagements.
  Objective: The focus of this study has been to identify what aspects that
firms should consider when they assess their need of influencing the RE process
in an OSS community, as well as what engagement practices that should be
considered in order to gain this influence.
  Method: Using a design science approach, 21 interviews with 18 industry
professionals from 12 different software-intensive firms were conducted to
explore, design and validate an artifact for the problem context.
  Results: A Community Strategy Framework (CSF) is presented to help firms
create community strategies that describe if and why they need influence on the
RE process in a specific (meritocratic) OSS community, and how the firm could
gain it. The framework consists of aspects and engagement practices. The
aspects help determine how important an OSS project and its community is from
business and technical perspectives. A community perspective is used when
considering the feasibility and potential in gaining influence. The engagement
practices are intended as a tool-box for how a firm can engage with a community
in order to build influence needed.
  Conclusion: It is concluded from interview-based validation that the proposed
CSF may provide support for firms in creating and tailoring community
strategies and help them to focus resources on communities that matter and gain
the influence needed on their respective RE processes.

it is argued that multiple entangled photon quantum illumination could help to
reduce the integration time when evaluating range-delay. Our analysis is
performed in the framework of three entangled photon states discrete quantum
illumination protocols. In this setting it is shown explicitly that using a
direct generalization of Lloyd's protocol to the case where signal states
describe two photons presents interesting advantages: 1. The reduction of the
probability of error with respect to Lloyd's quantum illumination, 2. The
reduction of the integration time with respect to Lloyd's quantum illumination,
3. The increase in the ultimate in the measurement of the range-delay accuracy.
