the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) model, a homogeneous distribution of
charge, spatially-confined in a few atomic layers. Here, by combining scanning
probe microscopy with density functional theory calculations, we show that
excess charge on the polar TaO$_2$ termination of KTaO$_3$(001) forms more
complex electronic states with different degrees of spatial and electronic
localization: charge density waves (CDW) coexist with strongly-localized
electron polarons and bipolarons. These surface electronic reconstructions,
originating from the combined action of electron-lattice interaction and
electronic correlation, are energetically more favorable than the 2DEG
solution. They exhibit distinct spectroscopy signals and impact on the surface
properties, as manifested by a local suppression of ferroelectric distortions.
Controlling the degree of charge ordering and the transition from ferroelectric
to paraelectric states could be of great benefit for the generation and
transport of carriers in electronic applications.

  Automata","28 pages",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Algorithms for model checking and satisfiability of the modal $\mu$-calculus
start by converting formulas to alternating parity tree automata. Thus, model
checking is reduced to checking acceptance by tree automata and satisfiability
to checking their emptiness. The first reduces directly to the solution of
parity games but the second is more complicated.
  We review the non-emptiness checking of alternating tree automata by a
reduction to solving parity games of a certain structure, so-called emptiness
games. Since the emptiness problem for alternating tree automata is
EXPTIME-complete, the size of these games is exponential in the number of
states of the input automaton. We show how the construction of the emptiness
games combines a (fixed) structural part with (history-)determinization of
parity word automata. For tree automata with certain syntactic structures,
simpler methods may be used to handle the treatment of the word automata, which
then may be asymptotically smaller than in the general case.
  These results have direct consequences in satisfiability and validity
checking for (various fragments of) the modal $\mu$-calculus.

  Vlasov dynamics","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2201.10397",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel Local Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) low
rank tensor method for simulating the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. The LoMaC
property refers to the exact local conservation of macroscopic mass, momentum
and energy at the discrete level. This is a follow-up work of our previous
development of a conservative low rank tensor approach for Vlasov dynamics
(arXiv:2201.10397). In that work, we applied a low rank tensor method with a
conservative singular value decomposition (SVD) to the high dimensional VP
system to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, while maintaining the local
conservation of mass and momentum. However, energy conservation is not
guaranteed, which is a critical property to avoid unphysical plasma
self-heating or cooling. The new ingredient in the LoMaC low rank tensor
algorithm is that we simultaneously evolve the macroscopic conservation laws of
mass, momentum and energy using a flux-difference form with kinetic flux vector
splitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank
kinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables
by a conservative orthogonal projection. The algorithm is extended to the high
dimensional problems by hierarchical Tuck decomposition of solution tensors and
a corresponding conservative projection algorithm. Extensive numerical tests on
the VP system are showcased for the algorithm's efficacy.

goal: analyzing the distribution of particles at `microscales' to predict
physical properties at `macroscales', whether for a liquid, composite material,
or entire Universe. The former theory provides an array of techniques to
characterize a wide class of microstructures; in this work, we apply them to
the distributions of galaxies. We focus on the lower-order correlation
functions, `void' and `particle' nearest-neighbor functions, pair-connectedness
functions, percolation properties, and a scalar order metric. Compared to
homogeneous Poisson and typical disordered systems, the cosmological
simulations exhibit enhanced large-scale clustering and longer tails in the
nearest-neighbor functions, due to the presence of quasi-long-range
correlations. On large scales, the system appears `hyperuniform', due to
primordial density fluctuations, whilst on the smallest scales, the system
becomes almost `antihyperuniform', and, via the order metric, is shown to be a
highly correlated disordered system. Via a finite scaling analysis, we show
that the percolation threshold of the galaxy catalogs is significantly lower
than for Poisson realizations; this is consistent with the observation that the
galaxy distribution contains larger voids. However, the two sets of simulations
share a fractal dimension, implying that they lie in the same universality
class. Finally, we consider the ability of large-scale clustering statistics to
constrain cosmological parameters using simulation-based inference. Both the
nearest-neighbor distribution and pair-connectedness function considerably
tighten bounds on the amplitude of cosmological fluctuations at a level
equivalent to observing twenty-five times more galaxies. These are a useful
alternative to the three-particle correlation, and are computable in much
reduced time. (Abridged)

tipping point transitions and long-term post-tipping-point behavior associated
with the time evolution of an unknown (or partially unknown), non-stationary,
potentially noisy and chaotic, dynamical system. We focus on the particularly
challenging situation where the past dynamical state time series that is
available for ML training predominantly lies in a restricted region of the
state space, while the behavior to be predicted evolves on a larger state space
set not fully observed by the ML model during training. In this situation, it
is required that the ML prediction system have the ability to extrapolate to
different dynamics past that which is observed during training. We investigate
the extent to which ML methods are capable of accomplishing useful results for
this task, as well as conditions under which they fail. In general, we found
that the ML methods were surprisingly effective even in situations that were
extremely challenging, but do (as one would expect) fail when ``too much""
extrapolation is required. For the latter case, we investigate the
effectiveness of combining the ML approach with conventional modeling based on
scientific knowledge, thus forming a hybrid prediction system which we find can
enable useful prediction even when its ML-based and knowledge-based components
fail when acting alone. We also found that achieving useful results may require
using very carefully selected ML hyperparameters and we propose a
hyperparameter optimization strategy to address this problem. The main
conclusion of this paper is that ML-based approaches are promising tools for
predicting the behavior of non-stationary dynamical systems even in the case
where the future evolution (perhaps due to the crossing of a tipping point)
includes dynamics on a set outside of that explored by the training data.

example, the possibility to iteratively generate or modify images by manually
adding specific items is a desired property that, to our knowledge, has not

recent transformer-based methods, also employs a decoder to autoregressively

The proposed architecture is composed by three modules: 1) a graph
convolutional network, to encode the relationships of the input graph; 2) an
encoder-decoder transformer, which autoregressively composes the output image;
3) an auto-encoder, employed to generate representations used as input/output

the non-[WC] planetary nebulae, and together define a class of IR-[WC] stars.
They have unusual IRAS colours, resembling stars in the earliest post-AGB
evolution and possibly related to PAH formation. Most or all show a double
chemistry, with both a neutral (molecular) oxygen-rich and an inner carbon-rich
region. Their dense nebulae indicate recent evolution from the AGB, suggesting
a fatal-thermal-pulse (FTP) scenario. Although both the colours and the stellar
characteristics predict fast evolution, it is shown that this phase must last
for 10^4 yr. The morphologies of the nebulae are discussed. For one object in
Sgr, the progenitor mass (1.3 solar masses) is known. The stellar temperatures
of the IR-[WC] stars appear much higher in low metallicity systems (LMC, Sgr).
This may be indicative of an extended 'pseudo' photosphere. It is proposed that
re-accretion of ejected gas may slow down the post-AGB evolution and so extend
the life time of the IR-[WC] stars.

performance of spatial indexes, particularly the R-tree, for a given data and
query workloads. As the areas covered by the R-tree index nodes overlap in
space, upon searching for a specific point in space, multiple paths from root
to leaf may potentially be explored. In the worst case, the entire R-tree could
be searched. In this paper, we define and use the overlap ratio to quantify the
degree of extraneous leaf node accesses required by a range query. The goal is
to enhance the query performance of a traditional R-tree for high-overlap range
queries as they tend to incur long running-times. We introduce a new AI-tree
that transforms the search operation of an R-tree into a multi-label
classification task to exclude the extraneous leaf node accesses. Then, we
augment a traditional R-tree to the AI-tree to form a hybrid ""AI+R""-tree. The
""AI+R""-tree can automatically differentiate between the high- and low-overlap
queries using a learned model. Thus, the ""AI+R""-tree processes high-overlap
queries using the AI-tree, and the low-overlap queries using the R-tree.
Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the ""AI+R""-tree can enhance the

be described in terms of the Mixmaster (vacuum Bianchi IX) model. In order to
understand the role played by quantum-gravity effects in this context, in the
present work we consider the semiclassical behavior of this model. Classically,
this system undergoes a series of transitions between Kasner epochs, which are
described by a specific transition law. This law is derived based on the
conservation of certain physical quantities and the rotational symmetry of the
system. In a quantum scenario, however, fluctuations and higher-order moments
modify these quantities, and consequently also the transition rule. In
particular, we perform a canonical quantization of the model and then
analytically obtain the modifications of this transition law for semiclassical
states peaked around classical trajectories. The transition rules for the
quantum moments are also obtained, and a number of interesting properties are
derived concerning the coupling between the different degrees of freedom. More
importantly, we show that, due to the presence of quantum-gravity effects and
contrary to the classical model, there appear certain finite ranges of the
Kasner parameters for which the system will not undergo further transitions and
will follow a Kasner regime until the singularity. Even if a more detailed
analysis is still needed, this feature points toward a possible resolution of
the classical chaotic behavior of the model. Finally, a numerical integration
of the equations of motion is also performed in order to verify the obtained
analytical results.

tracker solutions, and if these are located the overshoot problem is solved. We
show that, provided a sufficiently large hierarchy exists between the
inflationary scale and the weak scale, this will always occur in LVS as initial
seed radiation grows into the tracker solution. The consistency requirement of
ending in a stable vacuum containing the weak hierarchy therefore gives a
preference for high inflationary scales -- an anthropic argument, if one likes,
for a large inflation/weak hierarchy. We discuss various origins, both
universal and model-dependent, of the initial seed radiation (or matter). One

  4.1, and updated presentation of Assumption A",,,,"math-ph hep-th math.MP math.SG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge theory on manifolds with
corners, and characterize symplectic reduction whenever the theory admits a
local momentum map for the gauge group action. This is achieved by adapting
reduction by stages to the case of gauge subgroups that emerge in the presence
of corners.
  We start from a decomposition of the local momentum map into a bulk term
called constraint map, and a boundary term called flux map. The first stage, or
constraint reduction, views the constraint as the zero locus of a momentum map
for a normal subgroup $\mathcal{G}_\circ\subset\mathcal{G}$ (the constraint
gauge group). The second stage, or flux superselection, interprets the flux map
as the momentum map for the residual action of the flux gauge group
$\underline{\mathcal G}\doteq\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{G}_\circ$. Whereas the only
physically admissible value of the constraint map is zero, the flux map is
(largely) unconstrained. Equivariance is controlled by cocycles of the flux
gauge group.
  Reduction assigns to the boundary a Poisson manifold
$\underline{\underline{\mathcal P}}$, whose symplectic leaves correspond to the
preimages with respect to the flux map of the coadjoint (or affine) orbits of
the flux gauge group. We call them superselection sectors, for they provide a
classical analogue of the phenomenon of quantum superselection.
  To the corner, we further assign a symplectic Lie algebroid over a Poisson
manifold, $\mathsf{A}_{\partial} \to \mathcal{P}_{\partial}$, and a Poisson
submanifold of on-shell configurations
$\mathcal{C}_{\partial}\subset\mathcal{P}_{\partial}$. Both
$\mathcal{C}_{\partial}$ and $\underline{\underline{\mathcal{P}}}$ fibrate over
a common space of superselections.
  We work out in detail the application of the formalism to a class of
Yang--Mills theories, and discuss applications to Chern--Simons and $BF$
theories.

branch bump (AGBb) as a standard candle given the weak dependence between its

asymptotic-giant branch (AGB) samples, detecting the AGBb is not an easy task.
However, this is now possible thanks to the wealth of data collected by the
CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS space-borne missions. It is well-know that the AGB bump
provides valuable information on the internal structure of low-mass stars,
particularly on mixing processes such as core overshooting during the core
He-burning phase. In this context, we analysed ~ 4,000 evolved giants observed
by Kepler and TESS, including red-giant branch stars and AGB stars, for which
asteroseismic and spectrometric data are available. By using statistical
mixture models, we detected the AGBb both in frequency at maximum oscillation
power and in effective temperature. Then, we used the Modules for Experiments
in Stellar Astrophysics MESA stellar evolution code to model AGB stars and
match the AGBb occurrence with observations. From observations, we could derive
the AGBb location in 15 bins of mass and metallicity. We noted that the higher
the mass, the later the AGBb occurs in the evolutionary track, which agrees
with theoretical works. Moreover, we found a slight increase of the luminosity
at the AGBb when the metallicity increases, which complicates the use of the
AGBb as a standard candle. By fitting those observations with stellar models,
we noticed that low-mass stars (M < 1.0 $M_{\odot}$) require a small core
overshooting region during the core He-burning phase. This core overshooting
extent increases toward high mass, but above M > 1.5 $M_{\odot}$ we found that
the AGBb location cannot be reproduced with a realistic He-core overshooting
alone, and instead additional mixing processes have to be invoked.

acquires dMRI data consisting of only 6 diffusion weighted images (DWIs),
limiting the accuracy and precision of estimated microstructure indices.
Machine learning (ML) has been proposed to address this challenge. However,
existing ML-based methods are not robust to differing dMRI gradient sampling
schemes, nor are they rotation equivariant. Lack of robustness to sampling
schemes requires a new network to be trained for each scheme, complicating the
analysis of data from multiple sources. A possible consequence of the lack of
rotational equivariance is that the training dataset must contain a diverse
range of microstucture orientations. Here, we show spherical CNNs represent a
compelling alternative that is robust to new sampling schemes as well as
offering rotational equivariance. We show the latter can be leveraged to
decrease the number of training datapoints required.

be ambiguous, with disagreement between $\textit{ab initio}$ studies, which
favor $\Gamma_4^-$ as the primary mode, and global crystal refinements, which
point to $\Gamma_5^-$ instead. Here, we resolve this issue by demonstrating
from x-ray pair distribution function measurements that locally, $\Gamma_4^-$
dominates, but globally, $\Gamma_5^-$ dominates. This behavior is consistent
with the near degeneracy of the energy surfaces associated with these two
distortion modes found in our own $\textit{ab initio}$ simulations. Our
first-principles calculations also show that these energy surfaces are almost
isotropic, providing an explanation for the numerous structural transitions
found in Cd$_2$Nb$_2$O$_7$, as well as its relaxor behavior. Our results point
to several candidate descriptions of the local structure, some of which
demonstrate two-in/two-out behavior for Nb displacements within a given Nb

non-colliding trajectories for multiple robots acting in an environment, under

utilize simplifying assumptions or are incomplete. This work introduces
kinodynamic conflict-based search (K-CBS), a decentralized (decoupled) MRMP
algorithm that is general, scalable, and probabilistically complete. The
algorithm takes inspiration from successful solutions to the discrete analogue
of MRMP over finite graphs, known as multi-agent path finding (MAPF).
Specifically, we adapt ideas from conflict-based search (CBS) - a popular
decentralized MAPF algorithm - to the MRMP setting. The novelty in this
adaptation is that we work directly in the continuous domain, without the need
for discretization. In particular, the kinodynamic constraints are treated
natively. K-CBS plans for each robot individually using a low-level planner and
and grows a conflict tree to resolve collisions between robots by defining
constraints for individual robots. The low-level planner can be any
sampling-based, tree-search algorithm for kinodynamic robots, thus lifting
existing planners for single robots to the multi-robot settings. We show that
K-CBS inherits the (probabilistic) completeness of the low-level planner. We
illustrate the generality and performance of K-CBS in several case studies and

quantum science, with applications from quantum computation to many-body
physics and quantum-enhanced metrology. Approaches to solving this problem
include step-by-step assembly, reservoir engineering to irreversibly pump
towards a target state, and adiabatic evolution from a known initial state.
Here we construct low-entropy quantum fluids of light in a Bose Hubbard circuit
by combining particle-by-particle assembly and adiabatic preparation. We inject
individual photons into a disordered lattice where the eigenstates are known &
localized, then adiabatically remove this disorder, allowing quantum
fluctuations to melt the photons into a fluid. Using our plat-form, we first
benchmark this lattice melting technique by building and characterizing
arbitrary single-particle-in-a-box states, then assemble multi-particle
strongly correlated fluids. Inter-site entanglement measurements performed
through single-site tomography indicate that the particles in the fluid
delocalize, while two-body density correlation measurements demonstrate that
they also avoid one another, revealing Friedel oscillations characteristic of a
Tonks-Girardeau gas. This work opens new possibilities for preparation of
topological and otherwise exotic phases of synthetic matter.

pre-processing; and (2) the systems are specialized for temporal queries and
lack spatial query support. This paper presents CoVA, a novel cascade
architecture that splits the cascade computation between compressed domain and
pixel domain to address the decoding bottleneck, supporting both temporal and
spatial queries. CoVA cascades analysis into three major stages where the first
two stages are performed in compressed domain while the last one in pixel
domain. First, CoVA detects occurrences of moving objects (called blobs) over a
set of compressed frames (called tracks). Then, using the track results, CoVA
prudently selects a minimal set of frames to obtain the label information and
only decode them to compute the full DNNs, alleviating the decoding bottleneck.
Lastly, CoVA associates tracks with labels to produce the final analysis
results on which users can process both temporal and spatial queries. Our
experiments demonstrate that CoVA offers 4.8x throughput improvement over
modern cascade systems, while imposing modest accuracy loss.

Euclid and the LSST. Utilising these large samples to study the inner structure
of lens galaxies requires source redshifts, to turn lens models into mass
measurements. However, obtaining spectroscopic source redshifts for large lens
samples is prohibitive with the capacity of spectroscopic facilities.
Alternatively, we study the possibility of obtaining source photometric
redshifts (photo-zs) for large lens samples. Our strategy consists of
deblending the source and lens light by simultaneously modelling the lens and
background source in all available photometric bands, and feeding the derived
source colours to a template-fitting photo-z algorithm. We describe the lens
and source light with a Sersic profile, and the lens mass with a Singular
Isothermal Ellipsoid. We test our approach on a simulated and a real sample of
lenses, both in broad-band photometry of the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We
identify the deviations of the lens light from a Sersic profile and the
contrast between the lens and source image as the main drivers of the source
colour measurement error. We split the real sample based on the ratio $\Lambda$
of the lens to source surface brightness measured at the image locations. In
the $\Lambda<1$ regime, the photo-z outlier fraction is $20\%$, and the
accuracy of photo-z estimation is limited by the performance of
template-fitting process. In the opposite regime, the photo-z outlier fraction
is $75\%$, and the errors from the source colour measurements dominate the
photo-z uncertainty. Measuring source photo-zs for lenses with $\Lambda<1$
poses no particular challenges, compared to isolated galaxies. For systems with
significant lens light contamination, however, improving the description of the
surface brightness distribution of the lens is required: a single Sersic model
is not sufficiently accurate.

the quasar, between 2003 and 2010. We measure a period of $P_{o}=172.6\pm0.9$
days. We explore four scenarios to explain the origin of the periodicity: 1-
the high magnification microlensing event is due to a binary star in the
lensing galaxy, 2- QJ0158-4325 contains a massive binary black hole system in
its final dynamical stage before merging, 3- the quasar accretion disk contains
a bright inhomogeneity in Keplerian motion around the black hole, and 4- the
accretion disk is in precession. Among these four scenarios, only a
supermassive binary black hole can account for both the short observed period
and the amplitude of the signal, through the oscillation of the accretion disk
towards and away from high-magnification regions of a microlensing caustic. The
short measured period implies that the semi-long axis of the orbit is
$\sim10^{-3}$pc, and the coalescence timescale is $t_{coal}\sim1000$ years,
assuming that the decay of the orbit is solely powered by the emission of
gravitational waves. The probability of observing a system so close to
coalescence suggests either a much larger population of supermassive black hole
binaries than predicted, or, more likely, that some other mechanism
significantly increases the coalescence timescale. Three tests of the binary
black hole hypothesis include: i) the recurrence of oscillations in photometric
monitoring during any future microlensing events in either image, ii)
spectroscopic detection of Doppler shifts (up to 0.01$c$), and iii) the
detection of gravitational waves through Pulsar Timing Array experiments, such
as the SKA, which will have the sensitivity to detect the $\sim$100 nano-hertz

relatively high velocity dispersions and ICM temperatures often corresponding
to cluster-like potential wells. Their measured concentrations are typically
high, indicating early formation epochs as expected from the originally
proposed scenario for their origin as being older undisturbed systems. This is,
however, in contradiction with the typical lack of expected well developed cool
cores. Here, we apply a cluster dynamical indicator recently discovered in the
intracluster light fraction (ICLf) to a classic FG, RX J1000742.53+380046.6, to
assess its dynamical state. We also refine that indicator to use as an
independent age estimator. We find negative radial temperature and metal
abundance gradients, the abundance achieving supersolar values at the hot core.
The X-ray flux concentration is consistent with that of cool core systems. The
ICLf analysis provides an independent probe of the system's dynamical state and
shows that the system is very relaxed, more than all clusters, where the same
analysis has been performed. The specific ICLf is more $\sim$5 times higher
than any of the clusters previously analyzed, which is consistent with an older

the remnant of an NFW halo that is exposed to a slowly increasing isotropic

used to predict the asymptotic mass loss limit for orbiting subhaloes, solely
as a function of the initial structure of the subhalo and the value of the
tidal field at pericentre. Predictions can easily be made for differently
concentrated host-haloes with and without baryonic components, which differ
most notably in their relation between pericentre radius and tidal field. The
model correctly predicts several empirically measured relations such as the
`tidal track' and the `orbital frequency relation' that was reported by Errani
& Navarro (2021) for the case of an isothermal sphere. Further, we propose
applications of the `structure-tide' degeneracy which implies that increasing
the concentration of a subhalo has exactly the same impact on tidal stripping
as reducing the amplitude of the tidal field. Beyond this, we find that simple
relations hold for the bound mass, truncation radius, WIMP annihilation
luminosity and tidal ratio of tidally stripped NFW haloes in relation to
quantities measured at the radius of maximum circular velocity. Finally, we
note that NFW haloes cannot be completely disrupted when exposed adiabatically

in the transition of galaxies from actively star forming to quiescence. While
7/12 galaxies have statistically significant detections (with 2 more marginal
detections), the brightest only obtained 10 photons. Given the wide variety of
hardness ratios in this sample, we chose to pursue a forward modeling approach
to constrain the intrinsic luminosity and obscuration of these galaxies rather
than stacking. We constrain intrinsic luminosity of obscured power-laws based
on the total number of counts and spectral shape, itself mostly set by the
obscuration, with hardness ratios consistent with the data. We also tested
thermal models. While all the galaxies have power-law models consistent with
their observations, a third of the galaxies are better fit as an obscured
power-law and another third are better fit as thermal emission. If these
post-starburst galaxies, early in their transition, contain AGN, then these are
mostly confined to a lower obscuration ($n_H \leq10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) and lower
luminosity ($L_{2-10~ \rm keV}\leq10^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$). Two galaxies, however,
are clearly best fit as significantly obscured AGN. At least half of this
sample show evidence of at least low luminosity AGN activity, though none could
radiatively drive out the remaining molecular gas reservoirs. Therefore, these
AGN are more likely along for the ride, having been fed gas by the same
processes driving the transition.

nearly 50 years of Ca II H & K activity data from Mount Wilson and Keck-HIRES

timescale during the Mount Wilson survey that became flat when picked up later
with Keck-HIRES planet-search observations. Unfortunately, the transition
between these two data sets -- and therefore the transition into the candidate
Maunder Minimum phase -- contained little to no data. Here we present
additional Mount Wilson data not present in Baum et al. (2022) along with
photometry over a nearly 30-year baseline that definitively trace the
transition from cyclic activity to a prolonged phase of flat activity. We
present this as conclusive evidence of the star entering a grand magnetic
minimum and therefore the first true Maunder Minimum analog. We further show
that neither the overall brightness nor the chromospheric activity level (as
measured by S$_{\mathrm{HK}}$) is significantly lower during the grand magnetic
minimum than its activity cycle minimum, implying that anomalously low mean or
instantaneous activity levels are not a good diagnostic or criterion for
identifying additional Maunder Minimum candidates. Intraseasonal variability in
S$_{\mathrm{HK}}$, however, is lower in the star's grand minimum; this may
prove a useful symptom of the phenomenon.

[arXiv:1608.05134]. Accurate calibration of the interferometers must therefore
track and compensate for temporal variations in calibration model parameters.
These variations were tracked during the first three Advanced LIGO observing
runs, and compensation for some of them has been implemented in the calibration
procedure. During the second observing run, multiplicative corrections to the
interferometer response were applied while producing calibrated strain data
both in real-time and in high-latency. In a high-latency calibration produced
after the second observing run and during the entirety of the third observing
run, a correction involving updating filters was applied to the calibration --
the time dependence of the coupled cavity pole frequency $f_{\rm cc}$. This
paper describes the methods developed to compensate for variations in the
interferometer response requiring time-dependent filters, including variable
zeros, poles, gains, and time delays. The described methods were used to
provide compensation for well-modeled time dependence of the interferometer
response, which has helped to reduce systematic errors in the calibration to
$<2$% in magnitude and $<2^{\circ}$ in phase across LIGO's most sensitive
frequency band of 20 - 2000 Hz [arXiv:2005.02531, arXiv:2107.00129].

astrophysical inference studies by reducing uncertainty and bias in the sky

efficiently accelerated by ultra strong electromagnetic fields. However so far,
no numerical simulations were able to handle such extreme regimes of very high
Lorentz factors and magnetic field strengths. It is the purpose of this paper
to study particle acceleration and radiation reaction damping in a rotating
magnetic dipole with realistic field strengths typical of millisecond and young
pulsars as well as of magnetars. To this end, we implemented an exact
analytical particle pusher including radiation reaction in the reduced
Landau-Lifshitz approximation where the electromagnetic field is assumed
constant in time and uniform in space during one time step integration. The
position update is performed using a velocity Verlet method. We extensively
tested our algorithm against time independent background electromagnetic fields
like the electric drift in cross electric and magnetic fields and the magnetic
drift and mirror motion in a dipole. Eventually, we apply it to realistic
neutron star environments. We investigated particle acceleration and the impact
of radiation reaction for electrons, protons and iron nuclei plunged around
millisecond pulsars, young pulsars and magnetars, comparing it to situations
without radiation reaction. We found that the maximum Lorentz factor depends on
the particle species but only weakly on the neutron star type. Electrons reach
energies up to $\gamma_e \approx 10^8-10^9$ whereas protons energies up to
$\gamma_p \approx 10^5-10^6$ and iron up to $\gamma \approx 10^4-10^5$. While
protons and irons are not affected by radiation reaction, electrons are
drastically decelerated, reducing their maximum Lorentz factor by 2 orders of
magnitude. We also found that the radiation reaction limit trajectories fairly
agree with the reduced Landau-Lifshitz approximation in almost all cases.

sized domains has become a focal area of research from both a modelling and a
complexity viewpoint.Recently, projectivity of a family of distributions
emerged as a key property, ensuring that marginal probabilities are independent
of the domain size. However, the formalisation used currently assumes that the
domain is characterised only by its size. This contribution extends the notion
of projectivity from families of distributions indexed by domain size to
functors taking extensional data from a database. This makes projectivity
available for the large range of applications taking structured input. We
transfer key known results on projective families of distributions to the new
setting. This includes a characterisation of projective fragments in different
statistical relational formalisms as well as a general representation theorem
for projective families of distributions. Furthermore, we prove a
correspondence between projectivity and distributions on countably infinite
domains, which we use to unify and generalise earlier work on statistical
relational representations in infinite domains. Finally, we use the extended
notion of projectivity to define a further strengthening, which we call
$\sigma$-projectivity, and which allows the use of the same representation in
different modes while retaining projectivity.

Logic (STL) is a formal logic that can serve as a versatile, expressive, and
unambiguous formal language to describe robotic tasks. On one hand, existing
work in using STL for the robotics domain typically requires end-users to
express task specifications in STL, a challenge for non-expert users.
  On the other, translating from NL to STL specifications is currently
restricted to specific fragments. In this work, we propose DIALOGUESTL, an
interactive approach for learning correct and concise STL formulas from (often)
ambiguous NL descriptions. We use a combination of semantic parsing,
pre-trained transformer-based language models, and user-in-the-loop
clarifications aided by a small number of user demonstrations to predict the
best STL formula to encode NL task descriptions. An advantage of mapping NL to
STL is that there has been considerable recent work on the use of reinforcement
learning (RL) to identify control policies for robots. We show we can use Deep
Q-Learning techniques to learn optimal policies from the learned STL
specifications. We demonstrate that DIALOGUESTL is efficient, scalable, and
robust, and has high accuracy in predicting the correct STL formula with a few

Pressure-induced SC in Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_x$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ (SCCO) has long been
explained within one-band ladder theories. The dramatic pressure-driven
crossover from quasi one-to-two dimensional (1D-to-2D) transport and the
simultaneous vanishing of the spin gap due to ladder singlets in the metallic
state preceding SC however lie outside the scope of ladder-based theories.
Recent demonstration of rapid decay of superconducting correlations with
distance within a realistic multiband model of the cuprate ladder gives
additional credence to this viewpoint. Here we show that the assumption of
pressure-driven increase in hole concentration in the ladders cannot explain
the dimensionality crossover. The dimensionality crossover is due to discrete
change in Cu-ion ionicity accompanied by transfer of holes from the Cu to
O-ions, leading to ""negative charge-transfer gap"". Our theory of valence
transition driven dimensionality crossover in SCCO provides a generic
explanation of the very large increase in charge carrier density at critical
doping concentrations in both hole and electron doped layered cuprates We
propose a falsifiable experimental test of our theory.

examples how high confidence in life detection claims require either (1) a
strong prior hypothesis about the existence of life in a particular alien

false positives. As a case study, we discuss the role of priors and hypothesis
testing in recent results reporting potential detection of life in the Venusian
atmosphere and in the icy plumes of Enceladus. While many current leading
biosignature candidates are subject to false positives because they are not
definitive of life, our analyses demonstrate why it is necessary to shift focus
to candidate signatures that are definitive. This indicates a necessity to
develop methods that lack false positives, by using observables for life that
rely on prior hypotheses with strong theoretical and empirical support in
identifying defining features of life. Abstract theories developed in pursuit
of understanding universal features of life are more likely to be definitive
and to apply to life-as-we-don't-know-it. In the absence of alien examples
these are best validated in origin of life experiments, substantiating the need

off-policy reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia, which enables learning
in such an architecture. The model accounts for action-related modulation of
dopamine activity that is not captured by previous models that implement
on-policy algorithms. In particular, the model predicts that dopamine activity
signals a combination of reward prediction error (as in classic models) and
""action surprise,"" a measure of how unexpected an action is relative to the
basal ganglia's current policy. In the presence of the action surprise term,
the model implements an approximate form of Q-learning. On benchmark navigation
and reaching tasks, we show empirically that this model is capable of learning
from data driven completely or in part by other policies (e.g. from other brain
regions). By contrast, models without the action surprise term suffer in the
presence of additional policies, and are incapable of learning at all from
behavior that is completely externally driven. The model provides a
computational account for numerous experimental findings about dopamine
activity that cannot be explained by classic models of reinforcement learning
in the basal ganglia. These include differing levels of action surprise signals
in dorsal and ventral striatum, decreasing amounts movement-modulated dopamine
activity with practice, and representations of action initiation and kinematics
in dopamine activity. It also provides further predictions that can be tested

the non-abelian gauge field action in three dimensions. Next, by applying the
Ward identity, we determine the general tensorial structure for the amplitude
of $\langle GG\rangle$ in VSR, which is valid at any order of the loop
analysis. Moreover, we discuss the leading VSR corrections to the non-abelian
Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills action through the analysis of $\langle GG\rangle$,

a yielding single-degree-of-freedom oscillator coupled to a rocking wall with
supplemental damping (hysteretic or linear viscous) along its sides. The full
nonlinear equations of motion are derived, and the study presents an earthquake
response analysis in term of inelastic spectra. The study shows that for
structures with preyielding period T1<1.0 s the effect of supplemental damping
along the sides of the rocking wall is marginal even when large values of
damping are used. The study uncovers that occasionally the damped response
matches or exceeds the undamped response; however, when this happens, the
exceedance is marginal. The paper concludes that for yielding structures with
strength less than 10% of their weight the use of supplemental damping along
the sides of a rocking wall coupled to a yielding structure is not recommended.
The paper shows that supplemental damping along the sides of the rocking wall
may have some limited beneficial effects for structures with longer preyielding
periods (say T1>1.0 s). Nevertheless, no notable further response reduction is
observed when larger values of hysteretic or viscous damping are used.

in the formation and architecture of planetary systems. Astronomical
observations suggest that PPDs evolve in two timescales, accreting onto the
star for up to several million years (Myr) followed by gas dissipation within
<1 Myr. Because solar nebula magnetic fields are sustained by the gas of the
protoplanetary disk, we can use paleomagnetic measurements to infer the
lifetime of the solar nebula. Here, we use paleomagnetic measurements of
meteorites to constrain this lifetime and investigate whether the solar nebula
had a two-timescale evolution. We report on paleomagnetic measurements of bulk
subsamples of two CO carbonaceous chondrites: Allan Hills A77307 and Dominion
Range 08006. If magnetite in these meteorites can acquire a crystallization
remanent magnetization that recorded the ambient field during aqueous
alteration, our measurements suggest that the local magnetic field strength at
the CO parent body location was <0.9 \muT at some time between 2.7 and 5.1 Myr
after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions. Coupled with previous
paleomagnetic studies, we conclude that the dissipation of the solar nebula in
the 3-7 AU region occurred <1.5 Myr after the dissipation of the nebula in the
1-3 AU region, suggesting that protoplanetary disks go through a two-timescale
evolution in their lifetime, consistent with dissipation by photoevaporation
and/or magnetohydrodynamic winds. We also discuss future directions necessary
to obtain robust records of solar nebula fields using bulk chondrites,

  with Neural Network Based Battery Degradation Model","6 pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Battery energy storage system (BESS) can effectively mitigate the uncertainty
of variable renewable generation and provide flexible ancillary services.
However, degradation is a key concern for rechargeable batteries such as the
most widely used Lithium-ion battery. A neural network based battery
degradation (NNBD) model can accurately quantify the battery degradation. When
incorporating the NNBD model into security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC),
we can establish a battery degradation based SCUC (BD-SCUC) model that can
consider the equivalent battery degradation cost precisely. However, the
BD-SCUC may not be solved directly due to high non-linearity of the NNBD model.
To address this issue, the NNBD model is linearized by converting the nonlinear
activation function at each neuron into linear constraints, which enables
BD-SCUC to become a linearized BD-SCUC (L-BD-SCUC) model. Case studies
demonstrate the proposed L-BD-SCUC model can be efficiently solved for multiple
BESS buses power system day-ahead scheduling problems with the lowest total
cost including the equivalent degradation cost and normal operation cost.

$B\varphi^4$ model) is introduced in which the potential form for the values of
the field whose magnitudes are greater than $1$ is multiplied by the positive
number $B$. All features related to a single kink (antikink) solution remain
unchanged and are independent of parameter $B$. However, when a kink interacts
with an antikink in a collision, the results will significantly depend on
parameter $B$. Hence, for kink-antikink collisions, many features such as the
critical speed, output velocities for a fixed initial speed, two-bounce escape
windows, extreme values, and fractal structure in terms of parameter $B$ are
considered in detail numerically. The role of parameter $B$ in the emergence of
a nearly soliton behavior in kink-antikink collisions at some initial speed
intervals is clearly confirmed. The fractal structure in the diagrams of escape
windows is seen for the regime $B\leq 1$. However, for the regime $B >1$, this
behavior gradually becomes fuzzing and chaotic as it approaches $B = 3.3$. The
case $B = 3.3$ is obtained again as the minimum of the critical speed curve as
a function of $B$. For the regime $3.3< B \leq 10$, the chaotic behavior
gradually decreases. However, a fractal structure is never observed.
Nevertheless, it is shown that despite the fuzzing and shuffling of the escape
windows, they follow the rules of the resonant energy exchange theory.

boasting great soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but
unfortunately suffers from long acquisition times. Long scan times can lead to
motion artifacts, for example due to bulk patient motion such as head movement
and periodic motion produced by the heart or lungs. Motion artifacts can
degrade image quality and in some cases render the scans nondiagnostic. To
combat this problem, prospective and retrospective motion correction techniques
have been introduced. More recently, data driven methods using deep neural
networks have been proposed. As a large number of publicly available MRI
datasets are based on Fast Spin Echo (FSE) sequences, methods that use them for
training should incorporate the correct FSE acquisition dynamics.
Unfortunately, when simulating training data, many approaches fail to generate
accurate motion-corrupt images by neglecting the effects of the temporal
ordering of the k-space lines as well as neglecting the signal decay throughout
the FSE echo train. In this work, we highlight this consequence and demonstrate
a training method which correctly simulates the data acquisition process of FSE
sequences with higher fidelity by including sample ordering and signal decay
dynamics. Through numerical experiments, we show that accounting for the FSE
acquisition leads to better motion correction performance during inference.

the line transfer by including the three cyclotron resonant processes
(cyclotron absorption, cyclotron emission, cyclotron scattering). Subsequently,
the effects of gravitational red-shift and light bending on the emergent
spectra are computed. We have applied our code to predict the observable
spectra from three different emission geometries; 1) an optically thin slab
near the stellar surface, 2) an accretion mound formed by the accumulation of
the accreted matter, 3) an accretion column representing the zone of a settling
flow onto the star. Our results show that the locally emergent spectra from the
emission volume are significantly anisotropic. However, in the presence of
strong light bending the anisotropy reduces considerably. This averaging also
drastically reduces the strength of harmonics higher than second in the
observable cyclotron spectra. We find that uniform field slabs produce line
features that are too narrow, and mounds with large magnetic distortions
produce features that are too wide compared to the average widths of the
spectral features observed from various sources. The column with a gently
varying (dipole) field produces widths in the intermediate range, similar to
those observed.

Conventionally, smooth pycnophylactic interpolation is achieved by a cellular

the corresponding integer counting function $N(x)$, and the corresponding error
term $\Delta_{\mathcal{G}}(x):=\psi_{\mathcal{G}}(x)-x$ in the PNT of Beurling,
where $\psi_{\mathcal{G}}(x)$ is the Beurling analog of $\psi(x)$. First we
prove that if the Beurling zeta function $\zeta_{\mathcal{G}}$ does not vanish

$|\Delta_{\mathcal{G}}(x)| \le
x\exp(-(1-\varepsilon)\omega_\eta(x))~(x>x_0(\varepsilon))$, where
$\omega_\eta(y)$ is the naturally occurring conjugate function to $\eta(t)$,

  Workshop 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The limited and dynamically varied resources on edge devices motivate us to
deploy an optimized deep neural network that can adapt its sub-networks to fit
in different resource constraints. However, existing works often build
sub-networks through searching different network architectures in a
hand-crafted sampling space, which not only can result in a subpar performance
but also may cause on-device re-configuration overhead. In this paper, we
propose a novel training algorithm, Dynamic REal-time Sparse Subnets (DRESS).
DRESS samples multiple sub-networks from the same backbone network through
row-based unstructured sparsity, and jointly trains these sub-networks in
parallel with weighted loss. DRESS also exploits strategies including parameter
reusing and row-based fine-grained sampling for efficient storage consumption
and efficient on-device adaptation. Extensive experiments on public vision
datasets show that DRESS yields significantly higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art sub-networks.

with high penetration of inverter-connected resources under low and
time-varying inertia due to renewable energy (RE). We provide a distributed
virtual inertia (VI) allocation method using the distributed subgradient
algorithm. We implement our distributed control strategy under full and sparse
communication architectures. The distributed full and sparse communication
controllers achieve comparable performance to a centralized controller and
stabilize the test system within 6~s. We study the sensitivity of the
controller performance to varying objective function weights on phase angle
versus frequency deviation, gradient step sizes, and allowed rate of change of
inertia (RoCoI) coefficients. We observe that the settling time of the states
and the controller performance and effort are susceptible to changes in the
gradient step size and objective weights on the frequency and angle deviation.
While a higher objective weight on angle versus frequency deviations positively
affects their settling times, it negatively impacts controller performance and
control effort. The impact of this work is to propose distributed control
schemes as new mechanisms that act before or in alignment with primary and
secondary control to safely regulate the frequency in future power grids.

fidelity-varying bases. For efficient inference, we reorganize the bases as a
tensor, and use a tensor-Gaussian variational posterior to develop a scalable

vulnerable to the active power injection from distributed energy resources

brings new challenges to the voltage control. This paper proposes a two-stage
stochastic optimization strategy to optimally place the PV smart inverters with
Volt-VAr capability for distribution systems with high photovoltaic (PV)
penetration to mitigate voltage violation issues. The proposed optimization
strategy enables a planningstage guide for upgrading the existing PV inverters
to smart inverters with Volt-VAr capability while considering the
operationstage characteristics of the Volt-VAr control. One advantage of this
planning strategy is that it utilizes the local control capability of the smart
inverter that requires no communication, thus avoiding issues related to
communication delays and failures. Another advantage is that the Volt-VAr
control characteristic is internally integrated into the optimization model as
a set of constraints, making placement decisions more accurate. The objective
of the optimization is to minimize the upgrading cost and the number of the
smart inverters required while maintaining the voltage profile within the
acceptable range. Case studies on an actual 12.47kV, 9km long Arizona utility
feeder have been conducted using OpenDSS to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed placement strategy in both static and dynamic simulations. Index Terms

masses, from which we identify a sample of 24 binaries in long period orbits
($P_{\rm orb}\sim{\rm yrs}$) with a high probability of hosting a massive
($>$1.4 $M_{\odot}$), dark companion: a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH).
The luminous stars in these binaries tend to be F-, G-, and K-dwarfs with the
notable exception of one hot subdwarf. Follow-up spectroscopy of eight of these
stars shows no evidence for contamination by white dwarfs or other luminous
stars. The dark companions in these binaries span a mass range of 1.35-2.7
$M_{\odot}$ and therefore likely includes both NSs and BHs without a
significant mass gap in between. Furthermore, the masses of several of these
objects are $\simeq$1.7 $M_{\odot}$, similar to the mass of at least one of the
merging compact objects in GW190425. Given that these orbits are too wide for
significant mass accretion to have occurred, this sample implies that some NSs
are born heavy ($\gtrsim$1.5 $M_{\odot}$). Additionally, the low orbital
velocities ($\lesssim$20 km s$^{-1}$) of these binaries requires that at least
some heavy NSs receive low natal kicks, otherwise they would have been
disrupted during core collapse. Although none will become gravitational wave
sources within a Hubble time, these systems will be exceptionally useful for
testing binary evolution theory.

over-smoothing, which leads node states to become more similar with increased
depth. We build on the close connection between GNNs and PageRank, for which
personalized PageRank introduces the consideration of a personalization vector.
Adopting this idea, we propose the Personalized PageRank Graph Neural Network
(PPRGNN), which extends the graph convolutional network to an infinite-depth
model that has a chance to reset the neighbor aggregation back to the initial
state in each iteration. We introduce a nicely interpretable tweak to the
chance of resetting and prove the convergence of our approach to a unique
solution without placing any constraints, even when taking infinitely many
neighbor aggregations. As in personalized PageRank, our result does not suffer
from over-smoothing. While doing so, time complexity remains linear while we
keep memory complexity constant, independently of the depth of the network,
making it scale well to large graphs. We empirically show the effectiveness of

experimental psychology: equating American identity with being White. Embedding
association tests (EATs) using standardized images of self-identified Asian,
Black, Latina/o, and White individuals from the Chicago Face Database (CFD)
reveal that White individuals are more associated with collective in-group
words than are Asian, Black, or Latina/o individuals. In assessments of three
core aspects of American identity reported by social psychologists,
single-category EATs reveal that images of White individuals are more
associated with patriotism and with being born in America, but that, consistent
with prior findings in psychology, White individuals are associated with being
less likely to treat people of all races and backgrounds equally. Three
downstream machine learning tasks demonstrate biases associating American with
White. In a visual question answering task using BLIP, 97% of White individuals
are identified as American, compared to only 3% of Asian individuals. When
asked in what state the individual depicted lives in, the model responds China
53% of the time for Asian individuals, but always with an American state for
White individuals. In an image captioning task, BLIP remarks upon the race of
Asian individuals as much as 36% of the time, but never remarks upon race for
White individuals. Finally, provided with an initialization image from the CFD
and the text ""an American person,"" a synthetic image generator (VQGAN) using
the text-based guidance of CLIP lightens the skin tone of individuals of all
races (by 35% for Black individuals, based on pixel brightness). The results
indicate that biases equating American identity with being White are learned by
language-and-image AI, and propagate to downstream applications of such models.

controller can reason about the robot's underactuated dynamics in real-time to
guarantee collision-free motions. The effectiveness of this approach is
validated in simulation. First, a simple hand-reaching experiment shows that
the CBF-WBC enables the robot's hand to deviate from an infeasible reference
trajectory to avoid self-collisions. Second, the CBF-WBC is combined with a
linear model predictive controller (LMPC) designed for dynamic locomotion, and
the CBF-WBC is used to track the LMPC predictions. Walking experiments show
that adding CBFs avoids leg self-collisions when the footstep location or swing
trajectory provided by the high-level planner are infeasible for the real
robot, and generates feasible arm motions that improve disturbance recovery.

leads to improvements in convergence and reliability of adversarial training,

that using random sub-sampling of CIFAR10 to drop 40% of data, we lose 8%
adversarial accuracy against the strongest attackers, while by using only 20%

Interestingly, we discover that in some settings data pruning brings benefits
from both worlds-it both improves adversarial accuracy and training time.

networks owing to the abundant spectrum resources in the THz band. Whilst THz
signals suffer from severe propagation losses, a massive antenna array can be
deployed at the base station (BS) to mitigate those losses through beamforming.
Nevertheless, a large number of antennas increases the hardware complexity and
circuit power consumption, and hence it can lead to poor energy efficiency
(EE). To surmount this fundamental problem, we propose a novel array design
based on coupled antenna pairs. Specifically, we exploit the mutual coupling
between closely spaced antennas to form superdirective pairs. A unique property
of them is that all require the same excitation amplitude, and therefore can be
driven by a single radio frequency chain akin to conventional phased arrays.
Moreover, they facilitate the implementation of multi-port impedance matching,
which ensures maximum power transfer for any beamforming angle. After
addressing the hardware-related problems of superdirectivity, we show that the
number of BS antennas can be effectively reduced without sacrificing the
achievable rate. Simulation results showcase that our design offers huge EE
gains compared to uncoupled uniform linear arrays, and hence could be a radical
solution for future THz systems.

(both positive and negative) there exists a three-parameter, hence generic,
family of fronts (i.e., traveling-wave solutions with a contact line). A
two-parameter family of advancing ""linear-log"" fronts also exists, having a
logarithmically corrected linear behaviour in the liquid bulk. All these fronts
have finite rate of dissipation, indicating that singular potentials stand as
an alternative solution to the contact-line paradox. In agreement with steady
states, fronts have microscopic contact angle equal to $\pi/2$ for all $m>1$
and finite energy for all $m<3$. We also propose a selection criterion for the
fronts, based on thermodynamically consistent contact-line conditions modeling
friction at the contact line. So as contact-angle conditions do in the case of
slippage models, this criterion selects a unique (up to translation) linear-log
front for each positive speed. Numerical evidence suggests that, fixed the
speed and the frictional coefficient, its shape depends on the spreading
coefficient, with steeper fronts in partial wetting and a more prominent
precursor region in dry complete wetting.

the Kesten-Stigum theorem that holds in the entire supercritical regime and
states that the quenched and annealed exponential growth rates of an infinite

anomaly due to the opening of the ground-state Kramers doublet is observed from
the low-temperature specific-heat measurements when the applied magnetic fields
$\mu_0H >0.7$~T. At zero field, the increase of both $C_{\rm mag}/T$ and the
muon spin relaxation rate $\lambda$ below 1~K is due to the electronic spin
excitations, which often exist in quantum magnets where dipole-dipole
interaction creates an anisotropy of magnetic properties. The spin excitation
is also supported by the unusual maximum of field dependence of $\lambda$ due
to the field-induced increase of the density of excitations. We argue that

electoral control types, that C and D are identical: For each input I and each
election system, I is a Yes instance of both C and D, or of neither.
Surprisingly this had gone undetected, even as the field was score-carding how
many std. control types election systems were resistant to; various ""different""
cells on such score cards were, unknowingly, duplicate effort on the same
issue. This naturally raises the worry that other pairs of control types are
also identical, and so work still is being needlessly duplicated.
  We determine, for all std. control types, which pairs are, for elections
whose votes are linear orderings of the candidates, always identical. We show
that no identical control pairs exist beyond the known 7. We for 3 central
election systems determine which control pairs are identical (""collapse"") with
respect to those systems, and we explore containment/incomparability
relationships between control pairs. For approval voting, which has a different
""type"" for its votes, [HHM20]'s 7 collapses still hold. But we find 14
additional collapses that hold for approval voting but not for some election
systems whose votes are linear orderings. We find 1 additional collapse for
veto and none for plurality. We prove that each of the 3 election systems
mentioned have no collapses other than those inherited from [HHM20] or added
here. But we show many new containment relationships that hold between some
separating control pairs, and for each separating pair of std. control types
classify its separation in terms of containment (always, and strict on some
inputs) or incomparability.
  Our work, for the general case and these 3 important election systems,
clarifies the landscape of the 44 std. control types, for each pair collapsing
or separating them, and also providing finer-grained information on the
separations.

Timestamp supervision is a cost-effective way for this task. To obtain more
information to optimize the model, the existing method generated pseudo
frame-wise labels iteratively based on the output of a segmentation model and
the timestamp annotations. However, this practice may introduce noise and
oscillation during the training, and lead to performance degeneration. To
address this problem, we propose a new framework for timestamp supervised
temporal action segmentation by introducing a teacher model parallel to the
segmentation model to help stabilize the process of model optimization. The
teacher model can be seen as an ensemble of the segmentation model, which helps
to suppress the noise and to improve the stability of pseudo labels. We further
introduce a segmentally smoothing loss, which is more focused and cohesive, to
enforce the smooth transition of the predicted probabilities within action
instances. The experiments on three datasets show that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art method and performs comparably against the
fully-supervised methods at a much lower annotation cost.

called community detection in attributed networks. Most of the existing work
along this line has been carried out through objective function optimization
and has proposed numerous approaches. However, they tend to focus only on
lower-order details, i.e., capture node features and network topology from node
and edge views, and purely seek a higher degree of optimization to guarantee
the quality of the found communities, which exacerbates unbalanced communities
and free-rider effect. To further clarify and reveal the intrinsic nature of
networks, we conduct triangle-oriented community detection considering node
features and network topology. Specifically, we first introduce a
triangle-based quality metric to preserve higher-order details of node features
and network topology, and then formulate so-called two-level constraints to
encode lower-order details of node features and network topology. Finally, we
develop a local search framework based on optimizing our objective function
consisting of the proposed quality metric and two-level constraints to achieve
both non-overlapping and overlapping community detection in attributed
networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
our framework and its potential in alleviating unbalanced communities and

However, the linearized KG order is commonly obtained through a heuristic
search without data-driven optimization. In this paper, we optimize the
knowledge description order prediction under the order supervision extracted
from the caption and further enhance the consistency of the generated sentences

incorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed for decentralized

(fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple
sensors (varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely
unknown area. The MDM framework consists of a metacognitive component and a
self-cognitive component. The metacognitive component helps to self-regulate
the search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of
""which-sensor-to-use"", ""when-to-switch-sensor"", and ""how-to-search"". Each
sensor possesses inverse characteristics for the sensing attributes like
sensing range and accuracy. Based on the information gathered by multiple
sensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different
levels of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching. The
lower levels of search aim to localize the search space for the possible
presence of a target (detection) with different sensors. The highest level of a
search exploits the search space for target confirmation using the sensor with
the highest accuracy among all sensors. The performance of the MDM framework
with two sensors having low accuracy with wide range sensor for detection and
increased accuracy with low range sensor for confirmation is evaluated through
Monte-Carlo simulations and compared with six multi-UAV stochastic search

that transformers whose arithmetic precision is logarithmic in the number of
input tokens (and whose feedforward nets are computable using space linear in
their input) can be simulated by constant-depth logspace-uniform threshold
circuits. This provides insight on the power of transformers using known
results in complexity theory. For example, if $\mathsf L \neq \mathsf P$ (i.e.,
not all poly-time problems can be solved using logarithmic space), then
transformers cannot even accurately solve linear equalities or check membership
in an arbitrary context-free grammar with empty productions. Our result
intuitively emerges from the transformer architecture's high parallelizability.
We thus speculatively introduce the idea of a fundamental parallelism tradeoff:
any model architecture as parallelizable as the transformer will obey
limitations similar to it. Since parallelism is key to training models at
massive scale, this suggests a potential inherent weakness of the scaling
paradigm.

including computer graphics, computer vision, engineering design, etc. A search
engine requires primarily an input search query and a database of items to
search from. In engineering, which is the primary context of this paper, the
database consists of 3D CAD models, such as washers, pistons, connecting rods,
etc. A query from a user is typically in the form of a sketch, which attempts
to capture the details of a 3D model. However, sketches have certain typical
defects such as gaps, over-drawn portions (multi-strokes), etc. Since the
retrieved results are only as good as the input query, sketches need
cleaning-up and enhancement for better retrieval results.
  In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to improve or clean the
query sketches. Initially, sketches from various categories are analysed in
order to understand the many possible defects that may occur. A dataset of
cleaned-up or enhanced query sketches is then created based on an understanding
of these defects. Consequently, an end-to-end training of a deep neural network
is carried out in order to provide a mapping between the defective and the
clean sketches. This network takes the defective query sketch as the input and
generates a clean or an enhanced query sketch. Qualitative and quantitative
comparisons of the proposed approach with other state-of-the-art techniques
show that the proposed approach is effective. The results of the search engine
are reported using both the defective and enhanced query sketches, and it is
shown that using the enhanced query sketches from the developed approach yields
improved search results.

  Vision-Language Representation Learning and Retrieval",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the cross-modal pre-training task has been a hotspot because of its
wide application in various down-streaming researches including retrieval,
captioning, question answering and so on. However, exiting methods adopt a
one-stream pre-training model to explore the united vision-language
representation for conducting cross-modal retrieval, which easily suffer from
the calculation explosion. Moreover, although the conventional double-stream
structures are quite efficient, they still lack the vital cross-modal
interactions, resulting in low performances. Motivated by these challenges, we
put forward a Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training (COOKIE)
to grasp the joint text-image representations. Structurally, COOKIE adopts the
traditional double-stream structure because of the acceptable time consumption.
To overcome the inherent defects of double-stream structure as mentioned above,
we elaborately design two effective modules. Concretely, the first module is a
weight-sharing transformer that builds on the head of the visual and textual
encoders, aiming to semantically align text and image. This design enables
visual and textual paths focus on the same semantics. The other one is three
specially designed contrastive learning, aiming to share knowledge between
different models. The shared cross-modal knowledge develops the study of
unimodal representation greatly, promoting the single-modal retrieval tasks.
Extensive experimental results on multi-modal matching researches that includes
cross-modal retrieval, text matching, and image retrieval reveal the superiors
in calculation efficiency and statistical indicators of our pre-training model.

in the nearby galaxy NGC\,4631. The field of the object was routinely imaged
during the pre-eruptive stage by synoptic surveys, but the transient was
detected only at a few epochs from $\sim 231$\,days before maximum brightness.
The LRN outburst was monitored with unprecedented cadence both photometrically
and spectroscopically. AT\,2021biy shows a short-duration blue peak, with a
bolometric luminosity of $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{41}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, followed by
the longest plateau among LRNe to date, with a duration of 210\,days. A
late-time hump in the light curve was also observed, possibly produced by a
shell-shell collision. AT\,2021biy exhibits the typical spectral evolution of
LRNe. Early-time spectra are characterised by a blue continuum and prominent H
emission lines. Then, the continuum becomes redder, resembling that of a K-type
star with a forest of metal absorption lines during the plateau phase. Finally,
late-time spectra show a very red continuum ($T_{\mathrm{BB}} \approx 2050$ K)
with molecular features (e.g., TiO) resembling those of M-type stars.
Spectropolarimetric analysis indicates that AT\,2021biy has local dust
properties similar to those of V838\,Mon in the Milky Way Galaxy. Inspection of
archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} data taken on 2003 August 3 reveals a
$\sim 20$\,\msun\ progenitor candidate with log\,$(L/{\rm L}_{\odot}) =
5.0$\,dex and $T_{\rm{eff}} = 5900$\,K at solar metallicity. The above
luminosity and colour match those of a luminous yellow supergiant. Most likely,
this source is a close binary, with a 17--24\,\msun\ primary component.

of the most attractive parts. Producing natural language like humans using

dialogue systems, chatbots, machine translation, as well as computer-aid

natural language is relatively under-investigated, especially in the age of
pre-trained language models. In this work, we aim to preliminarily test whether
NLG can generate humor as humans do. We build a new dataset consisting of
numerous digitized Chinese Comical Crosstalk scripts (called C$^3$ in short),
which is for a popular Chinese performing art called `Xiangsheng' since 1800s.
(For convenience for non-Chinese speakers, we called `crosstalk' for
`Xiangsheng' in this paper.) We benchmark various generation approaches
including training-from-scratch Seq2seq, fine-tuned middle-scale PLMs, and
large-scale PLMs (with and without fine-tuning). Moreover, we also conduct a
human assessment, showing that 1) large-scale pretraining largely improves
crosstalk generation quality; and 2) even the scripts generated from the best
PLM is far from what we expect, with only 65% quality of human-created
crosstalk. We conclude, humor generation could be largely improved using
large-scaled PLMs, but it is still in its infancy.

aggregating the individual risks. This problem has no explicit solution except
in very limited situations. Deep learning is increasingly receiving attention

are two obstacles to reliably model the uncertain contingencies: 1)
decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) due to various line hardening decisions,
and 2) distributional ambiguity due to limited outage information during
extreme weather events (EWEs). To address these two challenges, this paper
develops scenario-wise decision-dependent ambiguity sets (SWDD-ASs), where the
DDU and distributional ambiguity inherent in EWE-induced contingencies are
simultaneously captured for each possible EWE scenario. Then, a two-stage
trilevel decision-dependent distributionally robust resilient enhancement
(DD-DRRE) model is formulated, whose outputs include the optimal line
hardening, distributed generation (DG) allocation, and proactive network
reconfiguration strategy under the worst-case distributions in SWDD-ASs.
Subsequently, the DD-DRRE model is equivalently recast to a mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP)-based master problem and multiple scenario-wise
subproblems, facilitating the adoption of a customized column-and-constraint
generation (C&CG) algorithm. Finally, case studies demonstrate a remarkable
improvement in the out-of-sample performance of our model, compared to its
prevailing stochastic and robust counterparts. Moreover, the potential values
of incorporating the ambiguity and distributional information are
quantitatively estimated, providing a useful reference for planners with

short pulse limit which resembles the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian where the
magnetic flux per plaquette is controlled by the ratio of the interaction
energy and the driving frequency. The quasispectrum of the Floquet operator of
the driving sequence shows the celebrated Hofstadter's butterfly pattern as
well as the existence of edge states. From the calculation of the local Chern

the dynamics of the edge states, show that they exhibit chirality. Finally, the
inclusion of the intraspecies interactions creates an overall harmonic trap in

a series of questions that can often be under- or over-specified. An ideal

with a user to resolve it. However, most existing studies either fail to or

Wikipedia and either asks for clarification or provides relevant information to
address user queries. We define two subtasks, namely evidence passage

use of contaminated speech in model training will apparently degrade the

proposed Glow-WaveGAN and propose a noise-independent speech representation
learning approach for high-quality voice conversion for noisy target speakers.
Specifically, we learn a latent feature space where we ensure that the target
distribution modeled by the conversion model is exactly from the modeled
distribution of the waveform generator. With this premise, we further manage to
make the latent feature to be noise-invariant. Specifically, we introduce a
noise-controllable WaveGAN, which directly learns the noise-independent
acoustic representation from waveform by the encoder and conducts noise control
in the hidden space through a FiLM module in the decoder. As for the conversion
model, importantly, we use a flow-based model to learn the distribution of
noise-independent but speaker-related latent features from phoneme
posteriorgrams. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves high speech quality and speaker similarity in the voice conversion for
noisy target speakers.

Training generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) usually requires large

central model using distributed data from different medical institutions while
keeping raw data locally. However, FL is vulnerable to backdoor attack, an
adversarial by poisoning training data, given the central server cannot access

classification models and centralized domains. In this study, we propose a way
of attacking federated GAN (FedGAN) by treating the discriminator with a
commonly used data poisoning strategy in backdoor attack classification models.
We demonstrate that adding a small trigger with size less than 0.5 percent of

attack, we provide two effective defense strategies: global malicious detection
and local training regularization. We show that combining the two defense

  Nets for Label Distribution Shift","This paper has been accepted by MICCAI 2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Class distribution plays an important role in learning deep classifiers. When
the proportion of each class in the test set differs from the training set, the
performance of classification nets usually degrades. Such a label distribution
shift problem is common in medical diagnosis since the prevalence of disease
vary over location and time. In this paper, we propose the first method to
tackle label shift for medical image classification, which effectively adapt
the model learned from a single training label distribution to arbitrary
unknown test label distribution. Our approach innovates distribution
calibration to learn multiple representative classifiers, which are capable of
handling different one-dominating-class distributions. When given a test image,
the diverse classifiers are dynamically aggregated via the consistency-driven
test-time adaptation, to deal with the unknown test label distribution. We
validate our method on two important medical image classification tasks
including liver fibrosis staging and COVID-19 severity prediction. Our
experiments clearly show the decreased model performance under label shift.
With our method, model performance significantly improves on all the test
datasets with different label shifts for both medical image diagnosis tasks.

models initially have a 50 percent primordial binary fraction. Using GalevNB we
convert the simulated data into synthetic spectra and photometry for the China
Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST). From the
spectral energy distributions we identify three stellar populations that
contribute to the UV-excess: (1) second asymptotic giant branch stars, which
contribute to the UV flux at early times; (2) naked helium stars, and (3) white
dwarfs, which are long-term contributors to the FUV spectra. Binary stars
consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence star are cataclysmic variable
(CV) candidates. The magnitude distribution of CV candidates is bimodal up to 2
Gyr. The bright CV population is particularly bright in FUV-NUV. The FUV-NUV
color of our model clusters is 1-2 mag redder than the UV-excess globular
clusters in M 87 and in the Milky Way. This discrepancy may be induced by
helium enrichment in observed clusters. Our simulations are based on simple
stellar evolution; we do not include the effects of variations in helium and
light elements or multiple stellar populations. A positive radial color
gradient is present in CSST NUV-y for main-sequence stars of all models with a
color difference of 0.2-0.5 mag, up to 4 half-mass radii. The CSST NUV-g color
correlates strongly with HST FUV-NUV for NUV-g>1 mag, with the linear relation
$FUV-NUV=(1.09\pm0.12)\times(NUV-g)+(-1.01\pm0.22)$. This allows for conversion
of future CSST NUV-g colors into HST FUV-NUV colors, which are sensitive to
UV-excess features. We find that CSST will be able to detect UV-excess in
galactic/extra-galactic star clusters with ages >200 Myr.

various model architectures, such as Bayesian networks and deep learning
methods, as well as on the analysis of different representations of the speech
signal. Despite significant progress in recent years, existing CAPT methods are
not able to detect pronunciation errors with high accuracy (only 60\% precision
at 40\%-80\% recall). One of the key problems is the low availability of
mispronounced speech that is needed for the reliable training of pronunciation
error detection models. If we had a generative model that could mimic
non-native speech and produce any amount of training data, then the task of
detecting pronunciation errors would be much easier. We present three
innovative techniques based on phoneme-to-phoneme (P2P), text-to-speech (T2S),
and speech-to-speech (S2S) conversion to generate correctly pronounced and
mispronounced synthetic speech. We show that these techniques not only improve
the accuracy of three machine learning models for detecting pronunciation
errors but also help establish a new state-of-the-art in the field. Earlier
studies have used simple speech generation techniques such as P2P conversion,
but only as an additional mechanism to improve the accuracy of pronunciation
error detection. We, on the other hand, consider speech generation to be the
first-class method of detecting pronunciation errors. The effectiveness of
these techniques is assessed in the tasks of detecting pronunciation and
lexical stress errors. Non-native English speech corpora of German, Italian,

technique improves the accuracy of detecting pronunciation errors in AUC metric
by 41\% from 0.528 to 0.749 compared to the state-of-the-art approach.

Extended to the two-qubit case, such solutions lie closet to a dark state
$\vert \psi_1\rangle$ with at most one photon in the spectrum, but will not
affect the adiabatic evolution along $\vert \psi_1\rangle$ because $\langle
\phi_K|\dot{H}|\psi_1\rangle=0$, and arbitrary single photon multimode $W$
state can be fast generated from $\vert \psi_1\rangle$. Interestingly, the
addition of Stark-shift terms could enlarge the effective energy gap between
$\vert \psi_1\rangle$ and its closet eigenstates, such that the $W$ state can
be ultrafast generated in a time proportional to the inverse of the resonator
frequency. Moreover, the generation time and fidelity can both be the same for
arbitrary $\vert W_M\rangle$. For this case, another kind of dark state which
is a product of just qubit ground states and photonic squeezed states exist in
the whole coupling regime with constant energy. The peculiarities of these dark
states pave the way of deterministic and ultrafast state-generation in the

language to explain neural language model (LM) behavior. However, free-text
rationales' unconstrained nature makes them prone to hallucination, so it is
important to have metrics for free-text rationale quality. Existing free-text
rationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's
predicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics'
reliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label
consistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three
axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales,
which maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately
sensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should
be robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text

concerning the pairing manner, and some of them postulate local pairing of
charge freedom through the strong correlation effect. Here we report the spin
resolved tunnelling measurements on extremely underdoped Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6-delta.
Our data reveal that, when holes are doped into the system, the
antiferromagnetic order is destroyed together with the filling up of the charge
transfer gap by some density of states (DOS) with a maximum at about 200 meV.
Consequently, an electronic structure with 4a0x4a0 basic plaquettes gradually
emerges, and they become more populated versus further hole doping. In the
central part of each plaquette, there are three unidirectional bars (along the
Cu-O bond) enlightened by the enhanced peaks of coherence-like DOS at about

that this confined nematic state within one 4a0x4a0 plaquette constitutes

different objects' local differences via Deep Neural Networks has achieved
success, how to exploit the query-support cross-image object semantic relations
in Transformer-based architecture remains under-explored in the few-shot
fine-grained scenario. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based
double-helix model, namely HelixFormer, to achieve the cross-image object
semantic relation mining in a bidirectional and symmetrical manner. The
HelixFormer consists of two steps: 1) Relation Mining Process (RMP) across
different branches, and 2) Representation Enhancement Process (REP) within each
individual branch. By the designed RMP, each branch can extract fine-grained
object-level Cross-image Semantic Relation Maps (CSRMs) using information from
the other branch, ensuring better cross-image interaction in semantically
related local object regions. Further, with the aid of CSRMs, the developed REP
can strengthen the extracted features for those discovered semantically-related
local regions in each branch, boosting the model's ability to distinguish
subtle feature differences of fine-grained objects. Extensive experiments
conducted on five public fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that HelixFormer
can effectively enhance the cross-image object semantic relation matching for
recognizing fine-grained objects, achieving much better performance over most

temperature model (M3TM), systematic, quantitative comparisons to both the
dynamics of energy flow and magnetic order are scarce. Here, we apply a M3TM to
the ultrafast magnetic order dynamics of the layered antiferromagnet

ferromagnetic order, and bulk antiferromagnetic order were explored at various
pump fluences employing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
time-resolved resonant magnetic soft x-ray diffraction, respectively. After
optical excitation, both the surface ferromagnetic order and the bulk
antiferromagnetic order dynamics exhibit two-step demagnetization behaviors
with two similar timescales (<1 ps, ~10 ps), indicating a strong exchange
coupling between localized 4f and itinerant conduction electrons. Despite a
good qualitative agreement, the M3TM predicts larger demagnetization than our
experimental observation, which can be phenomenologically described by a
transient, fluence-dependent increased N\'eel temperature. Our results indicate
that effects beyond a mean-field description have to be considered for a

Omniverse), which offers immediate assistance, resources specific to the
learner's needs, manipulation of these resources, and relevant feedback.
Considering guidance, we employ this prototype to investigate the effect of the
amount of guidance (fixed vs. adaptive-amount) and the type of guidance (fixed
vs. adaptive-associations) on the engagement and consequently the learning
outcomes of language learning in an AR environment. The results for the amount
of guidance show that compared to the adaptive-amount, the fixed-amount of
guidance group scored better in the immediate and delayed (after 7 days) recall
tests. However, this group also invested a significantly higher mental effort
to complete the task. The results for the type of guidance show that the
adaptive-associations group outperforms the fixed-associations group in the
immediate, delayed (after 7 days) recall tests, and learning efficiency. The
adaptive-associations group also showed significantly lower mental effort and
spent less time to complete the task.

envisioned in the beyond 5G wireless networks. This leads to the near-field
regime where the wavefront is no longer planar but spherical, bringing new
opportunities and challenges for communications and positioning. In this paper,
we improve the near-field positioning technology from the classical spherical
wavefront model (SWM) to the more accurate and true electromagnetic propagation
model (EPM). A generic near-field positioning model with different observation
capabilities for three electric field types (vector, scalar, and overall scalar
electric field) is developed based on the complete EPM. For these three
observed electric field types, the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) is adopted to
evaluate the achievable estimation accuracy. The expressions of the CRBs for
different electric field observations are derived by combining electromagnetic
propagation concepts with estimation theory. Closed-form expressions can be
further obtained as the terminal is assumed to be on the central perpendicular
line (CPL) of the receiving antenna surface. Moreover, the above discussions
are extended to the system with multiple receiving antennas. In this case, the
CRBs using various electric field types are derived, and the effect of
different numbers of receiving antennas is deeply investigated. Numerical
results are provided to quantify the CRBs and validate the analytical results.
Also, the impact of different system parameters, including electric field type,
wavelength, size of the receiving antenna, and number of antennas, is
evaluated.

geometry on oscillatory translational instabilities of $N$-spot equilibrium
solutions for a singularly perturbed Schnakenberg reaction-diffusion system
with $\mO(\eps^2) \ll \mO(1)$ activator-inhibitor diffusivity ratio. An
$N$-spot equilibrium is characterized by an activator concentration that is
exponentially small everywhere in $\Omega$ except in $N$ well-separated
localized regions of $\mO(\eps)$ extent. We use the method of matched
asymptotic analysis to analyze Hopf bifurcation thresholds above which the
equilibrium becomes unstable to translational perturbations, which result in
$\mO(\eps^2)$-frequency oscillations in the locations of the spots. We find
that stability to these perturbations is governed by a nonlinear
matrix-eigenvalue problem, the eigenvector of which is a $2N$-vector that
characterizes the possible modes (directions) of oscillation. The $2N\times 2N$
matrix contains terms associated with a certain Green's function on $\Omega$,
which encodes geometric effects. For the special case of a perturbed disk with
radius in polar coordinates $r = 1 + \sigma f(\theta)$ with \red{$0<
\varepsilon \ll \sigma \ll 1$}, $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$, and $f(\theta)$
$2\pi$-periodic, we show that only the mode-$2$ coefficients of the Fourier
series of $f$ impact the bifurcation threshold at leading order in $\sigma$. We
further show that when $f(\theta) = \cos2\theta$, the dominant mode of
oscillation is in the direction parallel to the longer axis of the perturbed
disk. Numerical investigations on the full Schnakenberg PDE are performed for
various domains $\Omega$ and $N$-spot equilibria to confirm asymptotic results

paved the way for the development of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.
Nevertheless, quantitative studies of the H-function, denoted by H(t), in
realistic systems are relatively scarce because of the difficulty of obtaining
the time-dependent momentum distribution analytically. Also, the earlier
attempts proceeded through the solution of Boltzmann's kinetic equation, which
was hard. Here we investigate, by direct molecular dynamics simulations and
analytic theory, the time dependence of H(t). We probe the sensitivity of
nonequilibrium relaxation to interaction potential and dimensionality by using
the H-function H(t). We evaluate H(t) for three different potentials in all
three dimensions and find that it exhibits surprisingly strong sensitivity to
these factors. The relaxation of H(t) is long in 1D, but short in 3D. We
obtain, for the first time, a closed-form analytic expression for H(t) using
the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the velocity space probability
distribution and compare its predictions with the simulation results.
Interestingly, H(t) is found to exhibit linear response when vastly different
initial nonequilibrium conditions are employed. The oft-quoted relation of
H-function with Clausius's entropy theorem is discussed.

adopting dynamical or statistical downscaling of precipitation, the accuracy is
limited by the availability of ground truth. A key challenge to gauge the
accuracy of such methods is to compare the downscaled data to point-scale

carry out the DL-based downscaling to estimate the local precipitation data

approximating the value from station location to a grid point. To test the

Deep Statistical Downscaling (DeepSD), augmented Convolutional Long Short Term

accretion disk surrounding a central object. The origin of the magnetic field,
which is a key component of the launching process, is still an open question.
Here we address the question of how the magnetic field required for jet
launching is generated and maintained by a dynamo process. By carrying out
non-ideal MHD simulations (PLUTO code), we investigate how the feedback of the
generated magnetic field on the mean-field dynamo affects the disk and jet
properties. We find that a stronger quenching of the dynamo leads to a
saturation of the magnetic field at a lower disk magnetization. Nevertheless,
we find that, while applying different dynamo feedback models, the overall jet
properties remain unaffected. We then investigate a feedback model which
encompasses a quenching of the magnetic diffusivity. Our modeling considers a
more consistent approach for mean-field dynamo modeling simulations, as the
magnetic quenching of turbulence should be considered for both, a turbulent
dynamo and turbulent magnetic diffusivity. We find that, after the magnetic
field is saturated, the Blandford-Payne mechanism can work efficiently, leading
to more collimated jets, that move, however, with slower speed. We find strong
intermittent periods of flaring and knot ejection for low Coriolis numbers. In
particular, flux ropes are built up and advected towards the inner disk thereby
cutting off of the inner disk wind, leading to magnetic field reversals,
reconnection and the emergence of intermittent flares.

bioactive molecules with structural diversity in various scenarios using a
trained variational autoencoder. We show that PGMG can generate molecules
matching given pharmacophore models while maintaining a high level of validity,
uniqueness, and novelty. In the case studies, we demonstrate the application of
PGMG to generate bioactive molecules in ligand-based and structure-based drug
de novo design, as well as in lead optimization scenarios. Overall, the
flexibility and effectiveness of PGMG make it a useful tool for accelerating
the drug discovery process.

modern transportation infrastructures. A variable speed limit (VSL) system can
be facilitated in the highway traffic network to provide useful and dynamic
speed limit information for drivers to travel with enhanced safety. Such system
is usually designed with a steady advisory speed in mind so that traffic can
move smoothly when drivers follow the speed, rather than speeding up whenever
there is a gap and slowing down at congestion. However, little attention has
been given to the research of vehicles' behaviours when drivers left the road
network governed by a VSL system, which may largely involve unexpected
acceleration, deceleration and frequent lane changes, resulting in chaos for
the subsequent highway road users. In this paper, we focus on the detection of
traffic flow anomaly due to drivers' lane change intention on the highway
traffic networks after a VSL system. More specifically, we apply graph
modelling on the traffic flow data generated by a popular mobility simulator,
SUMO, at road segment levels. We then evaluate the performance of lane changing
detection using the proposed Lane-GNN scheme, an attention temporal graph
convolutional neural network, and compare its performance with a temporal
convolutional neural network (TCNN) as our baseline. Our experimental results
show that the proposed Lane-GNN can detect drivers' lane change intention
within 90 seconds with an accuracy of 99.42% under certain assumptions.
Finally, some interpretation methods are applied to the trained models with a

arithmetic function defined by $\gcd(n, u_n).$ Recent studies have investigated
the distributional characteristics of $g_u$. Numerous results have been proven
based on the two extreme values $1$ and $n$ of $g_{u}(n)$. Sanna investigated
the average behaviour of $g_{u}$ and found asymptotic formulas for the moments
of $\log g_{u}$. In a related direction, Jha and Sanna investigated properties
of $g_{u}$ at shifted primes. In light of these results, we prove that for each
positive integer $\lambda,$ we have $$\sum_{\substack{p\le x\\p\text{ prime}}}
(\log g_{u}(p-1))^{\lambda} \sim P_{u,\lambda}\pi(x),$$ where $P_{u, \lambda}$
is a constant depending on $u$ and $\lambda$ which is expressible as an
infinite series. Additionally, we provide estimates for $P_{u,\lambda}$ and
$M_{u,\lambda},$ where $M_{u, \lambda}$ is the constant for an analogous sum
obtained by Sanna [J. Number Theory 191 (2018), 305-315]. As an application of
our results, we prove upper bounds on the count $\#\{p\le x : g_{u}(p-1)>y\}$
and also establish the existence of infinitely many runs of $m$ consecutive
primes $p$ in bounded intervals such that $g_{u}(p-1)>y$ based on a
breakthrough of Zhang, Maynard, Tao, et al. on small gaps between primes.
Exploring further in this direction, it turns out that for Lucas sequences with
nonunit discriminant, we have $\max\{g_{u}(n) : n \le x\} \gg x$. As an
analogue, we obtain that that $\max\{g_u(p-1) : p \le x\} \gg x^{0.4736}$

very low-confidence, leading cutting edge models to point cloud registration

question: Is it possible to exploit an intermediate yet misaligned image
between two low-overlap point clouds to enhance the performance of cutting-edge
registration models? To answer it, we propose a misaligned image supported
registration network for low-overlap point cloud pairs, dubbed ImLoveNet.
ImLoveNet first learns triple deep features across different modalities and
then exports these features to a two-stage classifier, for progressively
obtaining the high-confidence overlap region between the two point clouds.
Therefore, soft correspondences are well established on the predicted overlap
region, resulting in accurate rigid transformations for registration. ImLoveNet
is simple to implement yet effective, since 1) the misaligned image provides
clearer overlap information for the two low-overlap point clouds to better
locate overlap parts; 2) it contains certain geometry knowledge to extract
better deep features; and 3) it does not require the extrinsic parameters of
the imaging device with respect to the reference frame of the 3D point cloud.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on different kinds of
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our ImLoveNet over
state-of-the-art approaches.

nanoparticles (NPs) of different shape and increasing size up to 2.2 nm (700
atoms), by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We find that
Alizarin can bind in three different ways, depending on the number and type of

we investigate the optical properties of these systems by time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on the absorption spectra
and the Kohn-Sham orbitals analysis, we discovered that the mechanism of
electron injection depends on the Alizarin binding mode to the TiO2 surface.
While for bidented and chelated adsorption modes a direct charge transfer is
observed, for the tridented one an indirect mechanism governs the charge
transfer process following the excitation. Our results are in good agreement
with existing experimental data and suggests that by tailoring the shape of the
TiO2 NPs and, thus, determining the type of undercoordinated Ti atoms
prevalently exposed at the surface, it is possible to control the predominant
injection mechanism.

was discovered in a two-dimensional electron system placed in a strong
perpendicular magnetic field. It is entirely due to the electron-electron
interactions within a given Landau level. For special filling factors of the
Landau level, a many-particle incompressible state with a finite collective gap
is formed. Among these states, when the Landau level is half filled, there is a
special FQHE state that is described by the Pfaffian function and the state
supports charged excitations that obey non-Abelian statistics. Such a
$1/2$-FQHE state can be realized only for a special profile of the
electron-electron potential. For example, for conventional electron systems,
the $1/2$-FQHE state occurs only in the second Landau level, while in a
graphene monolayer, no $1/2$-FQHE state can be found in any Landau level.
Another type of low-dimensional system is the bilayer graphene, which consists
of two graphene monolayers coupled through the inter-layer hopping. The system
is quasi-two-dimensional, which makes it possible to tune the inter-electron
interaction potential by applying either the bias voltage or the magnetic field
that is applied parallel to the bilayer. It so happens that in the bilayer
graphene with AB staking, there is one Landau level per valley where the
$1/2$-FQHE state can indeed be present. The properties of that $1/2$-FQHE state
have a nonmonotonic dependence on the applied magnetic field and this can be
even more stable than the one discovered in conventional electron systems.

extremely challenging to be personalized if we directly apply federated

the real-time traffic state of roads, which we argue can significantly

Travel Time Estimation, which I) utilizes the federated learning approach,
allowing private data to be kept on client devices while training, and designs
the global model as an online generative model shared by all clients to infer

global energy function $H : E \to \mathbb{R}$, yielding Gibbs probability
measures (softmins) $\rho^\beta(H)$ for every inverse temperature $\beta =
T^{-1}$. Gibbs states are simultaneously characterized by free energy
principles and the max-entropy principle, with dual constraints on inverse
temperature $\beta$ and mean energy ${\cal U}(\beta) =
\mathbb{E}_{\rho^\beta}[H]$ respectively. The Legendre transform relates these
diverse variational principles which are unfortunately not tractable in high

  The global energy is generally given as a sum $H(x) = \sum_{\rm a \subset

E_{\rm a} \to \mathbb{R}$ indexed by bounded subregions ${\rm a} \subset
\Omega$, and this local structure can be used to design good approximation
schemes on thermodynamic functionals. We show that the generalized belief
propagation (GBP) algorithm solves a collection of local variational
principles, by converging to critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi approximations of
the free energy $F(\beta)$, the Shannon entropy $S(\cal U)$, and the
variational free energy ${\cal F}(\beta) = {\cal U} - \beta^{-1} S(\cal U)$,
extending an initial correspondence by Yedidia et al. This local form of
Legendre duality yields a possible degenerate relationship between mean energy

restricted mobility. We show that a certain class of gapless fractonic phases
are realized as a result of spontaneous breaking of continuous higher-form
symmetries whose conserved charges do not commute with spatial translations. We
refer to such symmetries as nonuniform higher-form symmetries. These symmetries
fall within the standard definition of higher-form symmetries in quantum field
theory, and the corresponding symmetry generators are topological. Worldlines
of particles are regarded as the charged objects of 1-form symmetries, and
mobility restrictions can be implemented by introducing additional 1-form
symmetries whose generators do not commute with spatial translations. These
features are realized by effective field theories associated with spontaneously
broken nonuniform 1-form symmetries. At low energies, the theories reduce to
known higher-rank gauge theories such as scalar/vector charge gauge theories,
and the gapless excitations in these theories are interpreted as
Nambu--Goldstone modes for higher-form symmetries. Due to the nonuniformity of
the symmetry, some of the modes acquire a gap, which is the higher-form
analogue of the inverse Higgs mechanism of spacetime symmetries. The gauge
theories have emergent nonuniform magnetic symmetries, and some of the magnetic
monopoles become fractonic. We identify the 't~Hooft anomalies of the
nonuniform higher-form symmetries and the corresponding bulk symmetry-protected
topological phases. By this method, the mobility restrictions are fully
determined by the choice of the commutation relations of charges with
translations. This approach allows us to view existing (gapless) fracton models

pricing of the related traded options which are written on non-storable assets
(i.e. the freight service) is not a trivial task. Management of freight risk is
of major importance to preserve the viability of shipping operations,
especially in periods where shocks appear in the world economy, which
introduces uncertainty in the freight rate prices. In practice, the reduction
of freight risk is almost exclusively performed by constructing hedging
portfolios relying on freight rate options. These portfolios needs to be robust
to the market uncertainties, i.e. to choose the portfolio which returns will be
as less as it gets affected by the market changes. Especially, for time periods
where the future states of the market (even in short term) are extremely
ambiguous, i.e. there are a number of different scenarios that can occur, it is
of great importance for the firms to decide robustly to these uncertainties. In
this work, a framework for the robust treatment of model uncertainty in (a)
modeling the freight rates dynamics employing the notion of Wasserstein
barycenter and (b) in choosing the optimal hedging strategy for freight risk
management, is proposed. A carefully designed simulation study in the discussed
hedging problem, employing standard modelling approaches in freight rates
literature, illustrates the capabilities of the proposed method with very
satisfactory results in approximating the optimal strategy even in high noise
cases.

using the following two main modules: (1) Stereo Disparity Estimation for Weak

utilizes the traditional stereo disparity estimation method to obtain reliable
disparity information from the overlap region. Given the disparity estimates as

potential of binocular images and improve the overall detection accuracy
accordingly. Further, the latter module minimizes the representational gap

proposes a doubly-iterative sparsified minimum mean square error (DI-S-MMSE)
turbo equalizer, which iteratively exchanges the extrinsic information between
a soft-input-soft-input (SISO) MMSE estimator and a SISO decoder. Our proposed
equalizer does not suffer from short loops and approaches the performance of
the near-optimal symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. To exploit
the inherent sparsity of OTFS system, we resort to graph theory to investigate
the sparsity pattern of the channel matrix, and propose two sparsification
guidelines to reduce the complexity of calculating the matrix inverse at the
MMSE estimator. Then, we apply two iterative algorithms to MMSE estimation,
i.e., the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) and Factorized Sparse
Approximate Inverse (FSPAI) algorithms. The former is used at the initial turbo
iteration, whose global convergence is proven in our equalizer, while the
latter is used at the subsequent turbo iterations with the help of our proposed
guidelines. Simulation results demonstrate that our equalizer has a linear
order of complexity while the performance loss incurred by the sparsification
is only 0.2 dB at $10^{-4}$ bit error rate.

compact object endowed with a mass of 2.50 to 2.67$M_{\odot}$. In the current
exposition, we are concerned with modeling of the lower mass component of the
coalescence pair. We utilise the $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity together with Minimum
Geometric Deformation (MGD) technique to obtain compact stellar objects with
masses aligned with the GW190814 event. Starting off with the Tolman IV ansatz
for one of the metric functions, together with a MIT Bag model equation of
state we are able to reduce the problem of fully describing the gravitational
behaviour of the seed solution to a quadrature. Through the MGD technique, we
introduce anisotropy by deforming the radial part of the gravitational
potential. This enables us to obtain two new classes of solutions which depend
on the metricity parameter, $\cal Q$ and the deformation constant, $\beta$. We
show that these two parameters play a crucial role in determining the
thermodynamical behaviour and stability of our models. In particular, we show
that the interplay between the metricity parameter and the deformation constant
leads to predicted mass of the progenitor articulating as the secondary

it's where even the rich use public transportation"". This is what Enrique
Penalosa, the celebrated ex-mayor of Bogota once said. However, in order to
achieve this objective, one of the crucial properties that the public
transportation systems need to satisfy is reliability. While reliability is
often referenced with respect to on-schedule arrivals and departures, in this
study we are interested in the ability of the system to satisfy the total
passenger demand. This is crucial, since if the capacity of the system is not
enough to satisfy all the passengers, then ridership will inevitably drop.
However, quantifying this excess demand is not straightforward since public
transit data, and in particular data from bus systems that we focus on in this
study, only include information for people that got on the bus, and not those
that were left behind at a stop due to a full bus. In this work, we design a
framework for estimating this excess demand. Our framework includes a mechanism
for identifying instances of potential excess demand, and a Poisson regression
model for the demand for a given bus route and stop. These instances of
potential excess demand are filtered out from the training phase of the Poisson
regression. We show through simulated data that this filtering is able to
remove the bias introduced by the censored data logged by the system. Failure
to remove these data points leads to an underestimation of the excess demand.
We then apply our approach on real data collected from the Pittsburgh Port
Authority and estimate the excess demand over an one-year period.
