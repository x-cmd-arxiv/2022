  Estimation from Longitudinal Observational Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating treatment effects, especially individualized treatment effects
(ITE), using observational data is challenging due to the complex situations of
confounding bias. Existing approaches for estimating treatment effects from
longitudinal observational data are usually built upon a strong assumption of
""unconfoundedness"", which is hard to fulfill in real-world practice. In this
paper, we propose the Variational Temporal Deconfounder (VTD), an approach that
leverages deep variational embeddings in the longitudinal setting using proxies
(i.e., surrogate variables that serve for unobservable variables).
Specifically, VTD leverages observed proxies to learn a hidden embedding that
reflects the true hidden confounders in the observational data. As such, our
VTD method does not rely on the ""unconfoundedness"" assumption. We test our VTD
method on both synthetic and real-world clinical data, and the results show
that our approach is effective when hidden confounding is the leading bias
compared to other existing models.

generated by neutrinos. Taking as reference a model of the Earth consisting of
55 concentric layers with constant densities determined from the PREM, we
evaluate the effect on the number of events due to changes in the composition

detector like ORCA to resolve such variations, we construct regions in planes
of two of these quantities where the statistical significance of the
discrepancies between the reference and the modified Earth are less than
$1\sigma$. The variations are implemented in such a way that the constraint
imposed by both the total mass of the Earth and its moment of inertia are

$m = 2$ mode. The growth in wall probe current is algebraic in nature and
increases for $f$ $\geq$ $0.005$, showing saturation at later time. Higher
values of ion temperatures than the electron temperatures indicate a resonant
energy transfer from electron plasma to ions via ion-resonance and concomitant
ion heating. The volume averaged temperature value of the electron plasma rises
with simulation time, attaining a quasi-steady nature near the end of the

the flux tube averaged electron temperatures along parallel and perpendicular

shared latent space from the Restricted Kernel Machine framework. Through the
lens of conjugate feature duality, we cast the weighted kernel principal
component analysis problem for MvSC and develop a modified weighted conjugate
feature duality to formulate dual variables. In our method, the dual variables,
playing the role of hidden features, are shared by all views to construct a
common latent space, coupling the views by learning projections from
view-specific spaces. Such single latent space promotes well-separated clusters
and provides straightforward data exploration, facilitating visualization and
interpretation. Our method requires only a single eigendecomposition, whose
dimension is independent of the number of views. To boost higher-order
correlations, tensor-based modelling is introduced without increasing
computational complexity. Our method can be flexibly applied with out-of-sample
extensions, enabling greatly improved efficiency for large-scale data with
fixed-size kernel schemes. Numerical experiments verify that our method is
effective regarding accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, showing a sharp
eigenvalue decay and distinct latent variable distributions.

We also give sufficient conditions on the elements of a block symmetric matrix
yielding an explicit form of its Moore-Penrose pseudo-inversion. Using the
explicit form of the pseudo-inverse matrix we can construct pseudo-inverse
graphs for a class of graphs which are constructed from the original graph by
adding pendent vertices or pendant paths.

considerably extending the stability of the original single relaxation time

subgrid model and the thickened flame approach have also been added allowing
for efficient large eddy simulations of turbulent reactive flows in complex

boundary conditions, is used to simulate combustion in two configurations:
flame front propagation in a 2-D combustion chamber with several obstacles, and
the 3-D PRECCINSTA swirl burner. Time evolution of the flame surface in the 2-D
configuration shows very good agreement compared to direct numerical and large
eddy simulation results available in the literature. The simulation of the
PRECCINSTA burner is first performed in the case of cold flow using two
different grid resolutions. Comparisons with experimental data reveal very good
agreement even at lower resolution. The model is then used, with a 2-step
chemistry and multi-component transport/thermodynamics, to simulate the
combustor at operating conditions similar to previously reported
experimental/numerical studies for $\phi$=0.83. Results are again in very good

show robots acting out toxic stereotypes with respect to gender, race, and

datasets and Dissolution Models (sometimes called ""foundation models"", e.g.

complexity and scale of the problem. Instead, we recommend that robot learning

proven safe, effective, and just. Finally, we discuss comprehensive policy

fully connected neural network, using a high polynomial order simulation but
only for a short time frame. With this corrective forcing, we can run the low
polynomial order simulation faster (with large time steps and low cost per time
step) while improving its accuracy.
  We explored this idea for a 1D Burgers' equation in (Marique and Ferrer, CAF
2022), and we have extended this work to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, with
and without a Large Eddy Simulation closure model. We test the methodology with
the turbulent Taylor Green Vortex case and for various Reynolds numbers (30,
200 and 1600). In addition, the Taylor Green Vortex evolves with time and
covers laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes, as time progresses.
  The proposed methodology proves to be applicable to a variety of flows and
regimes. The results show that the corrective forcing is effective in all
Reynolds numbers and time frames (excluding the initial flow development). We
can train the corrective forcing with a polynomial order of 8, to increase the
accuracy of simulations from a polynomial order 3 to 6, when correcting outside
the training time frame. The low order correct solution is 4 to 5 times faster
than a simulation with comparable accuracy (polynomial order 6).
  Additionally, we explore changes in the hyperparameters and use transfer
learning to speed up the training. We observe that it is not useful to train a
corrective forcing using a different flow condition. However, an already
trained corrective forcing can be used to initialise a new training (at the
correct flow conditions) to obtain an effective forcing with only a few

understand its source(s), and provide mitigation strategies. First, we develop
quantitative metrics to measure the Bperp bias and quantify the effect in both
local (physical) and native image-plane components. Second we test and evaluate
different inversion options and data sources, to systematically characterize
the impacts of choices, including explicitly accounting for the magnetic fill
fraction ff. Third we deploy a simple model to test how noise and different
models of the bias may manifest. From these three investigations we find that
while the bias is dominantly present in under-resolved structures, it is also
present in strong-field pixel-filling structures. Noise in the magnetograms can
exacerbate the problem, but it is not the primary cause. We show that fitting
ff explicitly provides significant mitigation, but that other considerations
such as choice of chi^2 weights and optimization algorithms can impact the
results as well. Finally, we demonstrate a straightforward ""quick fix"" that can
be applied post-facto but prior to solving the 180deg ambiguity in Bperp, and
which may be useful when global-scale structures are, e.g., used for model

crystalline silicate emissions share the similar parameters and are at the same
evolutionary stage. We detect a solar-nearby outbursting EXor Herbig star

lines of HI, HeI, OI, NaI, and CaII originated from the rapid accretion during

features are detected in its infrared spectrum. We also make a statistic
analysis on the disk properties of all known Herbig stars using the defined
infrared spectral indices. The proportion of Herbig stars with moderate
infrared excesses decreases as effective temperature increases. The majority of
the precursors (F-, G-, or K- type) have moderate infrared excesses. Hotter
Herbig stars tend to have a larger proportion with large infrared excesses. The
trends may be due to the fact that hotter stars have larger areas of
re-emitting dust, although there is some scatter due to the particularities of

analysis problems, overturning conventional machine learning and statistical
methods. Most often, a model trained for one market or security cannot be
directly applied to another market or security due to differences inherent in
the market conditions. In addition, as the market evolves through time, it is
necessary to update the existing models or train new ones when new data is made
available. This scenario, which is inherent in most financial forecasting
applications, naturally raises the following research question: How to
efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new set of data while retaining
performance on the old data, especially when the old data is not accessible? In
this paper, we propose a method to efficiently retain the knowledge available
in a neural network pre-trained on a set of securities and adapt it to achieve
high performance in new ones. In our method, the prior knowledge encoded in a
pre-trained neural network is maintained by keeping existing connections fixed,
and this knowledge is adjusted for the new securities by a set of augmented
connections, which are optimized using the new data. The auxiliary connections
are constrained to be of low rank. This not only allows us to rapidly optimize
for the new task but also reduces the storage and run-time complexity during
the deployment phase. The efficiency of our approach is empirically validated
in the stock mid-price movement prediction problem using a large-scale limit

complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the society, the positive
externalities faced by individuals, and the variety in the public response to

underlying societal structure. Our first main result is a structural
decomposition of the government's objectives into two independent components --
a component dependent on the utility function of individuals, and another
dependent on properties of the underlying network. Since the network dependent
term in this decomposition is unaffected by the signals sent by the government,
this characterization simplifies the problem of finding the optimal information
disclosure policies. We find explicit conditions, in terms of the risk aversion
and prudence, under which no disclosure, full disclosure, exaggeration and
downplay are the optimal policies. The structural decomposition results are
also helpful in studying other forms of interventions like incentive design and

and modern data processing techniques for the understanding of the universe.
Various approaches have been proposed for improving the efficiency of the
detection scheme, with hierarchical matched filtering being an important
strategy. Meanwhile, deep learning methods have recently demonstrated both
consistency with matched filtering methods and remarkable statistical
performance. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Detection Network (HDN), a
novel approach to efficient detection that combines ideas from hierarchical
matching and deep learning. The network is trained using a novel loss function,
which encodes simultaneously the goals of statistical accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the source of complexity reduction of the proposed model, and
describe a general recipe for initialization with each layer specializing in
different regions. We demonstrate the performance of HDN with experiments using
open LIGO data and synthetic injections, and observe with two-layer models a
$79\%$ efficiency gain compared with matched filtering at an equal error rate
of $0.2\%$. Furthermore, we show how training a three-layer HDN initialized
using two-layer model can further boost both accuracy and efficiency,
highlighting the power of multiple simple layers in efficient detection.

own novel skill-based method Hierarchical Kickstarting (HKS), which is shown to
outperform all other evaluated methods. Our experiments show that learning with

emission distribution in nearby edge-on spiral galaxies. Our sample consists of
16 angularly large and 13 less spatially resolved galaxies selected from the
DustPedia sample. To explore the dust emission distribution, we exploit the
Herschel photometry in the range 100-500 $\mu$m. We employ S\'ersic and
three-dimensional disc models to fit the observed two-dimensional profiles of
the galaxies. Both approaches give similar results. Our analysis unequivocally
states the case for the presence of extraplanar dust in between 6 to 10 large
galaxies. The results reveal that both the disc scale length and height
increase as a function of wavelength between 100 and 500 $\mu$m. The dust disc
scale height positively correlates with the dust disc scale length, similar to
what is observed for the stellar discs. We also find correlations between the
scale lengths and scale heights in the near- and far-infrared which suggest
that the stellar discs and their dust counterparts are tightly connected.
Furthermore, the intrinsic flattening of the dust disc is inversely
proportional to the maximum rotation velocity and the dust mass of the galaxy:
more massive spiral galaxies host, on average, relatively thinner dust discs.
Also, there is a tendency for the dust-to-stellar scale height ratio to
decrease with the dust mass and rotation velocity. We conclude that low-mass
spiral galaxies host a diffuse, puffed-up dust disc with a thickness similar to
that of the stellar disc.

modules $M$ over a given poset P, is defined as the map sending each comparable
pair $p\leq q$ in P to the rank of the linear map $M(p\leq q)$. The recently
introduced notion of generalized rank invariant (GRI) acquires more
discriminating power than the RI at the expense of enlarging the domain of RI
to the set Int(P) of intervals of P or to an even larger set. Given that the
size of Int(P) can be much larger than that of the domain of the RI,
restricting the domain of the GRI to smaller, more manageable subcollections
$\mathcal{I}$ of Int(P) would be desirable to reduce the total cost of
computing the GRI.
  This work studies the tension which exists between computational efficiency
and strength when restricting the domain of the GRI to different choices of
$\mathcal{I}$. In particular, we prove that the discriminating power of the GRI
over restricted collections $\mathcal{I}$ strictly increases as $\mathcal{I}$
interpolates between the domain of RI and Int(P). Along the way, some
well-known results regarding the RI or GRI from the literature are
contextualized within the framework of the M\""obius inversion formula and we
obtain a notion of generalize persistence diagram that does not require local
finiteness of the indexing poset for persistence modules.
  Lastly, motivated by a recent finding that zigzag persistence can be used to
compute the GRI, we pay a special attention to comparing the discriminating
power of the GRI for persistence modules $M$ over $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the
so-called Zigzag-path-Indexed Barcode (ZIB), a map sending each zigzag path
$\Gamma$ in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ to the barcode of the restriction of $M$ to
$\Gamma$. Clarifying the connection between the GRI and the ZIB is potentially
important to understand to what extent zigzag persistence algorithms can be
exploited for computing the GRI.

standard GBCs are called boundary GBCs while the new GBCs are called interior
GBCs. Then we present an analysis on these two kinds of harmonic GBCs to show
that each GBC function whose value is $1$ at a vertex (boundary or interior
vertex of $\Omega$) decays to zero away from its supporting vertex
exponentially fast except for a trivial example. Based on the exponential decay
property, we explain how to approximate the harmonic GBC functions locally.
That is, due to the locality of these two kinds of GBCs, one can approximate
each of
  these GBC functions by its local versions which is supported over a
sub-domain of $\Omega$. The local version of these GBC function will help
reduce the computational time for shape deformation in graphical design. Next,
with these two kinds of GBC functions at hand, we can use them to approximate
the solution of the Dirichlet problem of the Poisson equation. This may provide
a more efficient way to solve the Poisson equation by using a computer which
has graphical processing unit(GPU) with thousands or more processes than the
standard methods using a computer with one or few CPU kernels.

eigenvalue of the expected design matrix grows as $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ whenever
the expected cumulative regret of the algorithm is $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is
the learning horizon, and the action-space has a constant Hessian around the
optimal arm. This shows that such action-spaces force a polynomial lower bound
rather than a logarithmic lower bound, as shown by \cite{lattimore2017end}, in
discrete (i.e., well-separated) action spaces. Furthermore, while the previous
result is shown to hold only in the asymptotic regime (as $n \to \infty$), our
result for these ""locally rich"" action spaces is any-time. Additionally, under
a mild technical assumption, we obtain a similar lower bound on the minimum
eigen value holding with high probability.
  We apply our result to two practical scenarios -- \emph{model selection} and
\emph{clustering} in linear bandits. For model selection, we show that an
epoch-based linear bandit algorithm adapts to the true model complexity at a
rate exponential in the number of epochs, by virtue of our novel spectral
bound. For clustering, we consider a multi agent framework where we show, by
leveraging the spectral result, that no forced exploration is necessary -- the
agents can run a linear bandit algorithm and estimate their underlying
parameters at once, and hence incur a low regret.

problems: the user may not have a reference style image, or it may be difficult
to summarise the desired style in mind with just one image. The recently
proposed CLIPstyler has solved this problem, which is able to perform style
transfer based only on the provided description of the style image. Although
CLIPstyler can achieve good performance when landscapes or portraits appear
alone, it can blur the people and lose the original semantics when people and
landscapes coexist. Based on these issues, we demonstrate a novel framework
that uses a pre-trained CLIP text-image embedding model and guides image style
transfer through an FCN semantic segmentation network. Specifically, we solve
the portrait over-styling problem for both selfies and real-world landscape

transfer in portrait and landscape, and make the degree of image style transfer
in different semantic parts fully controllable. Our Generative Artisan resolve
the failure case of CLIPstyler and yield both qualitative and quantitative

transform to enable remote teaching. Adjusting courses on embedded systems and
micro-controllers was extra challenging since interaction with real hardware is
their integral part. We start by comparing our experience with four basic
alternatives of teaching embedded systems: 1) interacting with hardware at
school, 2) having remote access to hardware, 3) lending hardware to students
for at-home work and 4) virtualizing hardware. Afterward, we evaluate in detail
our experience of the fast transition from traditional, offline at-school
hardware programming course to using remote access to real hardware present in
the lab. The somewhat unusual remote hardware access approach turned out to be
a fully viable alternative for teaching embedded systems, enabling a relatively
low-effort transition. Our setup is based on existing solutions and stable open
technologies without the need for custom-developed applications that require
high maintenance. We evaluate the experience of both the students and teachers
and condense takeaways for future courses. The specific environment setup is
available online as an inspiration for others.

consisting of $K\geq 2$ distinct perishable components. These components arrive
randomly over time at high speed at the assemble-to-order production station,
and they wait in their respective queues according to their categories until
matched or their ""patience"" runs out. An instantaneous match occurs if all
categories are available, and thereafter the matched components leave
immediately. For a sequence of such matching queue systems parameterized by
$n$, when the arrival rates of all categories tend to infinity in concert as
$n$ tends to infinity, we obtain a heavy traffic limit of the appropriately
scaled queue length vector under mild assumptions, which is characterized by a
coupled stochastic integral equation with a scalar-valued non-linear term. We
demonstrate some crucial properties of such a coupling behavior for certain
coupled equations. We also exhibit that a generalized coupled stochastic
integral equation admits a unique weak solution that has the strong Markov
property. Moreover, we establish an asymptotic Little's law for each queue,
which reveals the asymptotic relationship between the queue length and its
virtual waiting time. Motivated by the cost structure of blood bank drives, we
formulate an infinite-horizon discounted cost functional and show that the
expected value of this cost functional for the $n$th system converges to that
of the heavy traffic limiting process as $n$ tends to infinity.

brightness changes for each pixel. Due to their high dynamic range, pixel
bandwidth, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational
simplicity, they are beneficial for vision-based projects in challenging
lighting conditions and they can detect fast movements with their microsecond
response time. The first generation of ECs are monochrome, but color data is
very useful and sometimes essential for certain vision-based applications. The
latest technology enables manufacturers to build color ECs, trading off the
size of the sensor and substantially reducing the resolution compared to
monochrome models, despite having the same bandwidth. In addition, ECs only
detect changes in light and do not show static or slowly moving objects. We
introduce a method to detect full RGB events using a monochrome EC aided by a
structured light projector. The projector emits rapidly changing RGB patterns
of light beams on the scene, the reflection of which is captured by the EC. We
combine the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques and allow depth and

information such as their check-in time and location is a primary objective of
Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. However, the issue of contextual
bias (i.e., how much consumers prefer one situation over another) has received
little attention from the research community. This paper examines the effect of
temporal bias, defined as the difference between users' check-in hours, leisure
vs.~work hours, on the consumer-side fairness of context-aware recommendation
algorithms. We believe that eliminating this type of temporal (and
geographical) bias might contribute to a drop in traffic-related air pollution,
noting that rush-hour traffic may be more congested. To surface effective POI
recommendations, we evaluated the sensitivity of state-of-the-art context-aware
models to the temporal bias contained in users' check-in activities on two POI

context-aware recommendation models prefer one group of users over another
based on the time of check-in and that this preference persists even when users
have the same amount of interactions.

As a direct application, we show how this type of convergence naturally
condenses the limit of several interesting genealogical quantities: the
population size, the time to the most-recent common ancestor, the reduced tree
and the tree generated by $k$ uniformly sampled individuals. As in a recent

average fraction of HCN luminosity from within the regions with $A_{V} \geq 8$

$0.478\pm0.149$. Based on a comparison with column density maps from Herschel,
HCN and HCO$^{+}$ trace dense gas in high column density regions better than

the relative velocity, while the effect of the relative velocity is strongest
on small scales (less than a few hundred kpc). This separation of scales
naturally lends itself to the use of `zoom' simulations, and here we present
our methodology to self-consistently incorporate the relative velocity at the

recombination through to the start time of the simulation. We also apply our
methodology to a large-scale cosmological zoom simulation. In qualitative
agreement with previous works, we find that the halo mass function and halo

allowing parties to conduct transactions off-chain, i.e, without broadcasting

sender and a receiver can either establish a direct payment channel with a
funding blockchain transaction or leverage existing channels in a multi-hop
payment. The security of PCNs usually relies on the synchrony of the underlying
blockchain, i.e., evidence of misbehavior needs to be published on the
blockchain within a time limit. Alternative payment channel proposals that do
not require blockchain synchrony rely on quorum certificates and use a
committee to register the transactions of a channel. However, these proposals
do not support multi-hop payments, a limitation we aim to overcome. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is in fact impossible to design a multi-hop
payment protocol with both network asynchrony and faulty channels, i.e.,
channels that may not correctly follow the protocol. We then detail two
committee-based multi-hop payment protocols that respectively assume
synchronous communications and possibly faulty channels, or asynchronous
communication and correct channels. The first protocol relies on possibly
faulty committees instead of the blockchain to resolve channel disputes, and
enforces privacy properties within a synchronous network. The second one relies
on committees that contain at most f faulty members out of 3f+1 and
successively delegate to each other the role of eventually completing a
multi-hop payment. We show that both protocols satisfy the security
requirements of a multi-hop payment and compare their communication complexity

charge density wave (CDW) order and phase transitions. These phenomena are
critical ingredients for superconductivity and predominantly occur in metallic

more recently, in Kagome lattice materials. However, CDW in semiconducting
systems, specifically at the limit of low carrier concentration region, is
uncommon. Here, we combine electrical transport, synchrotron X-ray diffraction

dilute d-band semiconductor, BaTiS3, which suggests the existence of strong
electron-phonon coupling. The CDW state further undergoes an unusual transition
featuring a sharp increase in carrier mobility. Our work establishes BaTiS3 as
a unique platform to study the CDW physics in the dilute filling limit to
explore novel electronic phases.

  Proof of Concept",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Falls, highly common in the constantly increasing global aging population,
can have a variety of negative effects on their health, well-being, and quality
of life, including restricting their capabilities to conduct Activities of
Daily Living (ADLs), which are crucial for one's sustenance. Timely assistance
during falls is highly necessary, which involves tracking the indoor location
of the elderly during their diverse navigational patterns associated with ADLs
to detect the precise location of a fall. With the decreasing caregiver
population on a global scale, it is important that the future of intelligent
living environments can detect falls during ADLs while being able to track the
indoor location of the elderly in the real world. To address these challenges,
this work proposes a cost-effective and simplistic design paradigm for an
Ambient Assisted Living system that can capture multimodal components of user
behaviors during ADLs that are necessary for performing fall detection and
indoor localization in a simultaneous manner in the real world. Proof of
concept results from real-world experiments are presented to uphold the
effective working of the system. The findings from two comparison studies with
prior works in this field are also presented to uphold the novelty of this
work. The first comparison study shows how the proposed system outperforms
prior works in the areas of indoor localization and fall detection in terms of
the effectiveness of its software design and hardware design. The second
comparison study shows that the cost for the development of this system is the
least as compared to prior works in these fields, which involved real-world
development of the underlining systems, thereby upholding its cost-effective
nature.

ensure software quality. However, the abundance of review tasks and the
intensity of the workload for reviewers negatively impact the quality of the
reviews. The short review text is often unactionable, which needs further
interaction between the reviewer and the developer. The problem becomes more
critical in dynamic teams and in the case of new team members who are less
familiar with their reviewers and perspectives. Aims: We are proposing the
Example Driven Review Explanation (EDRE) method to facilitate the code review
process by adding additional explanations through examples. EDRE recommends
similar code reviews as examples to further explain a review and help a
developer to understand the received reviews with less communication overhead.
Method: Through an empirical study in an industrial setting and by analyzing
3,722 code reviews across three open-source projects, we compared five methods
of data retrieval, text classification, and text recommendation. Results: EDRE
using TF-IDF word embedding along with an SVM classifier can provide practical
examples for each code review with 92% F-score and 90% Accuracy. Conclusions:
The example-based explanation is an established method for assisting experts in

accurately provide a set of context-specific examples to facilitate the code

geomagnetic storm (2018 August 26) in solar cycle 24. The underlying coronal
mass ejection (CME) originating from a quiescent filament region becomes a 440
km/s magnetic cloud (MC) at 1 au after ~5 days. The prolonged CME acceleration
(for about 24 hrs) coincides with the time profiles of the post-eruption arcade
intensity and reconnected flux. Chen et al. (2019) obtain lower speed since
they assumed that the CME does not accelerate after about 12 hrs. The presence
of multiple coronal holes near the filament channel and the high-speed wind
from them seem to have the combined effect of producing complex rotation in the
corona and IP medium resulting in a high-inclination MC. The Dst time profile
in the main phase steepens significantly (rapid increase in storm intensity)
coincident with the density increase (prominence material) in the second half
of the MC. Simulations using the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere
(CIMI) model shows that a higher ring current energy results from larger
dynamic pressure in MCs. Furthermore, the Dst index is highly correlated with
the main-phase time integral of the ring current injection that includes
density, consistent with the simulations. A complex temporal structure develops
in the storm main phase if the underlying MC has a complex density structure
during intervals of southward interplanetary magnetic field. We conclude that
the high intensity of the storm results from the prolonged CME acceleration,
complex rotation, and the high density in the 1-au MC.

  distribution correction",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bayesian inference for high-dimensional inverse problems is computationally
costly and requires selecting a suitable prior distribution. Amortized
variational inference addresses these challenges via a neural network that
approximates the posterior distribution not only for one instance of data, but
a distribution of data pertaining to a specific inverse problem. During
inference, the neural network -- in our case a conditional normalizing flow --
provides posterior samples at virtually no cost. However, the accuracy of
amortized variational inference relies on the availability of high-fidelity
training data, which seldom exists in geophysical inverse problems due to the
Earth's heterogeneity. In addition, the network is prone to errors if evaluated
over out-of-distribution data. As such, we propose to increase the resilience
of amortized variational inference in the presence of moderate data
distribution shifts. We achieve this via a correction to the latent
distribution that improves the posterior distribution approximation for the
data at hand. The correction involves relaxing the standard Gaussian assumption
on the latent distribution and parameterizing it via a Gaussian distribution
with an unknown mean and (diagonal) covariance. These unknowns are then
estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the corrected
and the (physics-based) true posterior distributions. While generic and
applicable to other inverse problems, by means of a linearized seismic imaging
example, we show that our correction step improves the robustness of amortized
variational inference with respect to changes in the number of seismic sources,
noise variance, and shifts in the prior distribution. This approach provides a
seismic image with limited artifacts and an assessment of its uncertainty at
approximately the same cost as five reverse-time migrations.

antenna arrays employed at BSs, the beamspace channel is sparse for each user,
and thus there is no need to serve all the users in a cell by all the beams
therein jointly. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop a flexible
clustered cell-free networking scheme that can decompose the whole network into
a number of weakly interfered small subnetworks operating independently and in
parallel. Given a per-user rate constraint for service quality guarantee, this
paper aims to maximize the number of decomposed subnetworks so as to reduce the
signaling overhead and system complexity as much as possible. By formulating it
as a bipartite graph partitioning problem, a rate-constrained network
decomposition (RC-NetDecomp) algorithm is proposed, which can smoothly tune the
network structure from the current cellular network with simple beam allocation
to a fully cooperative network by increasing the required per-user rate.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RC-NetDecomp algorithm
outperforms existing baselines in terms of average per-user rate, fairness

in the captured images. One way to reduce noise is to use longer exposure
during the capture. However, in the presence of motion (scene or camera
motion), longer exposures lead to motion blur, resulting in loss of image
information. This creates a trade-off between these two kinds of image
degradations: motion blur (due to long exposure) vs. noise (due to short
exposure), also referred as a dual image corruption pair in this paper. With
the rise of cameras capable of capturing multiple exposures of the same scene
simultaneously, it is possible to overcome this trade-off. Our key observation
is that although the amount and nature of degradation varies for these
different image captures, the semantic content remains the same across all
images. To this end, we propose a method to leverage these multi exposure
captures for robust inference under low-light and motion. Our method builds on
a feature consistency loss to encourage similar results from these individual
captures, and uses the ensemble of their final predictions for robust visual

many aspects of quantum information science and applications, where the
principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) plays an important role. The quantum
state compatibility problem asks whether there exists a density matrix $\rho$
compatible with some given measurement results. Such a compatibility problem
can be naturally formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP), which searches
directly for the existence of a $\rho$. However, for large system dimensions,
it is hard to represent $\rho$ directly, since it needs too many parameters. In
this work, we apply MaxEnt to solve various quantum state compatibility
problems, including the quantum marginal problem. An immediate advantage of the
MaxEnt method is that it only needs to represent $\rho$ via a relatively small
number of parameters, which is exactly the number of the operators measured.
Furthermore, in case of incompatible measurement results, our method will
further return a witness that is a supporting hyperplane of the compatible set.
Our method has a clear geometric meaning and can be computed effectively with
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

impact of this phenomenon includes human losses, environmental damage and high
economic costs. To mitigate these effects, several computer simulation systems
have been developed in order to predict fire behavior based on a set of input
parameters, also called a scenario (wind speed and direction; temperature;
etc.). However, the results of a simulation usually have a high degree of error
due to the uncertainty in the values of some variables, because they are not
known, or because their measurement may be imprecise, erroneous, or impossible
to perform in real time. Previous works have proposed the combination of
multiple results in order to reduce this uncertainty. State-of-the-art methods
are based on parallel optimization strategies that use a fitness function to
guide the search among all possible scenarios. Although these methods have
shown improvements in the quality of predictions, they have some limitations
related to the algorithms used for the selection of scenarios. To overcome
these limitations, in this work we propose to apply the Novelty Search
paradigm, which replaces the objective function by a measure of the novelty of
the solutions found, which allows the search to continuously generate solutions
with behaviors that differ from one another. This approach avoids local optima
and may be able to find useful solutions that would be difficult or impossible
to find by other algorithms. As with existing methods, this proposal may also
be adapted to other propagation models (floods, avalanches or landslides).

with coherent control of spin states, we achieve control of magnitude,

we confirm the multiplet spin structure of a WM, paving the way for active
control of newly emerging correlated electron states for application in

While ensuring scalability by distributed storage, FileInsurer guarantees

Therefore, only a relatively small deposit needs to be pledged by storage
providers to cover the potential file loss. Because of lower burdens of

redundancy in videos. Recent progress in masked video modelling, i.e.,
VideoMAE, has shown the ability of vanilla Vision Transformers (ViT) to
complement spatio-temporal contexts given only limited visual contents.
Inspired by this, we propose propose Masked Action Recognition (MAR), which
reduces the redundant computation by discarding a proportion of patches and
operating only on a part of the videos. MAR contains the following two
indispensable components: cell running masking and bridging classifier.
Specifically, to enable the ViT to perceive the details beyond the visible
patches easily, cell running masking is presented to preserve the
spatio-temporal correlations in videos, which ensures the patches at the same
spatial location can be observed in turn for easy reconstructions.
Additionally, we notice that, although the partially observed features can
reconstruct semantically explicit invisible patches, they fail to achieve
accurate classification. To address this, a bridging classifier is proposed to
bridge the semantic gap between the ViT encoded features for reconstruction and
the features specialized for classification. Our proposed MAR reduces the
computational cost of ViT by 53% and extensive experiments show that MAR
consistently outperforms existing ViT models with a notable margin. Especially,
we found a ViT-Large trained by MAR outperforms the ViT-Huge trained by a
standard training scheme by convincing margins on both Kinetics-400 and

$\mathfrak{p}^+_2:=(\mathfrak{p}^+)^{-\sigma}\subset\mathfrak{p}^+$. The object
of this article is to understand the decomposition of the restriction
$\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)|_{\widetilde{G}_1}$ by studying the weighted Bergman
inner product on each $\widetilde{K}_1$-type in
$\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2)\subset\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)$. For example, by
computing explicitly the norm $\Vert f\Vert_\lambda$ for
$f=f(x_2)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2)$, we can determine the
Parseval--Plancherel-type formula for the decomposition of
$\mathcal{H}_\lambda(D)|_{\widetilde{G}_1}$. Also, by computing the poles of
$\left\langle
f(x_2),e^{(x|\overline{z})_{\mathfrak{p}^+}}\right\rangle_{\lambda,x}$ for
$f(x_2)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2)$,
$x=(x_1,x_2),z\in\mathfrak{p}^+=\mathfrak{p}^+_1\oplus\mathfrak{p}^+_2$, we can
get some information on branching of
$\mathcal{O}_\lambda(D)|_{\widetilde{G}_1}$ also for $\lambda$ in non-unitary
range. In this article we consider these problems for all
$\widetilde{K}_1$-types in $\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{p}^+_2)$.

Bajic","Collaborative Inference for AI-Empowered IoT Devices","This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and particularly deep learning
systems, are traditionally the domain of large-scale cloud servers, which have
access to high computational and energy resources. Nonetheless, in
Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, the interface with the real-world is carried
out using edge devices that are limited in hardware and can communicate. The
conventional approach to provide AI processing to data collected by edge
devices involves sending samples to the cloud, at the cost of latency,
communication, connectivity, and privacy concerns. Consequently, recent years
have witnessed a growing interest in enabling AI-aided inference on edge
devices by leveraging their communication capabilities to establish
collaborative inference. This article reviews candidate strategies for
facilitating the transition of AI to IoT devices via collaboration. We identify
the need to operate in different mobility and connectivity constraints as a
motivating factor to consider multiple schemes, which can be roughly divided
into methods where inference is done remotely, i.e., on the cloud, and those
that infer on the edge. We identify the key characteristics of each strategy in
terms of inference accuracy, communication latency, privacy, and connectivity
requirements, providing a systematic comparison between existing approaches. We
conclude by presenting future research challenges and opportunities arising
from the concept of collaborative inference.

Meter-wavelength solar emission spans angular scales from a few arcminutes to a
few degrees. These emissions show temporal and spectral variability on a
sub-second and sub-MHz scales. The brightness temperature of these emissions
also varies by many orders of magnitude, which requires high-dynamic-range
spectroscopic snapshot imaging. With the unique array configuration of the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the robust calibration and imaging
pipeline, Automated Imaging Routine for the Compact Arrays for the Radio Sun
(AIRCARS) produces the best spectroscopic snapshot solar images available to
date. The working principle and the strength of this algorithm are demonstrated
using statistical analysis and simulation. AIRCARS uses the partial phase
stability of the MWA, which has a compact core with a large number of antenna
elements distributed over a small array footprint. The strength of this
algorithm makes it a state-of-the-art calibration and imaging pipeline for
low-frequency solar imaging, which is expected to be highly suitable for the
upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and other future radio interferometers
for producing high-dynamic-range and high-fidelity images of the Sun.

predator-prey systems and non-linear oscillators. In these bifurcations,
extended attractors such as limit cycles, limit tori and strange attractors
merge and split in a similar way as fixed points in a pitchfork bifurcation. We
show that this merging and splitting coincides with the coalescence of
covariant Lyapunov vectors, generalizing the notion of exceptional points to
non-linear dynamical systems. We distinguish two classes of systems,
corresponding respectively to continuous and discontinuous behaviors of the
covariant Lyapunov vectors at the transition. We illustrate our results with
concrete examples from neuroscience, ecology, and physics. Potential

are dedicated to exploring more insightful neural mechanisms to achieve
near-biological intelligence. Intuitively, biomimetic mechanisms are crucial to
understanding and improving SNNs. For example, the associative long-term
potentiation (ALTP) phenomenon suggests that in addition to learning mechanisms
between neurons, there are associative effects within neurons. However, most
existing methods only focus on the former and lack exploration of the internal
association effects. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Internal
Association~(AIA) neuron model to establish previously ignored influences
within neurons. Consistent with the ALTP phenomenon, the AIA neuron model is
adaptive to input stimuli, and internal associative learning occurs only when
both dendrites are stimulated at the same time. In addition, we employ weighted
weights to measure internal associations and introduce intermediate caches to
reduce the volatility of associations. Extensive experiments on prevailing
neuromorphic datasets show that the proposed method can potentiate or depress
the firing of spikes more specifically, resulting in better performance with
fewer spikes. It is worth noting that without adding any parameters at
inference, the AIA model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
DVS-CIFAR10~(83.9\%) and N-CARS~(95.64\%) datasets.

Previous work on the DQC communication optimization focus on optimizing the
communication protocol for each individual non-local gate and then adopt
quantum compilation designs which are designed for local multi-qubit gates
(such as controlled-x or CX gates) in a single quantum computer. The
communication patterns in distributed quantum programs are not yet well
studied, leading to a far-from-optimal communication cost. In this paper, we

Conventional anonymization methods unavoidably cause semantic information loss,
leading to limited data utility. Besides, existing learned anonymization
techniques, while retaining various identity-irrelevant utilities, will change
the pedestrian identity, and thus are unsuitable for training robust
re-identification models. To explore the privacy-utility trade-off for
pedestrian images, we propose a joint learning reversible anonymization
framework, which can reversibly generate full-body anonymous images with little
performance drop on person re-identification tasks. The core idea is that we
adopt desensitized images generated by conventional methods as the initial
privacy-preserving supervision and jointly train an anonymization encoder with
a recovery decoder and an identity-invariant model. We further propose a
progressive training strategy to improve the performance, which iteratively
upgrades the initial anonymization supervision. Experiments further demonstrate
the effectiveness of our anonymized pedestrian images for privacy protection,
which boosts the re-identification performance while preserving privacy. Code

into a quad-domain counterpart so that all the features in the sinogram, image,
and their corresponding Fourier domains are synergized to eliminate metal
artifacts optimally without compromising structural subtleties. Our proposed
quad-domain network for MAR, referred to as Quad-Net, takes little additional
computational cost since the Fourier transform is highly efficient, and works
across the four receptive fields to learn both global and local features as
well as their relations. Specifically, we first design a Sinogram-Fourier
Restoration Network (SFR-Net) in the sinogram domain and its Fourier space to
faithfully inpaint metal-corrupted traces. Then, we couple SFR-Net with an
Image-Fourier Refinement Network (IFR-Net) which takes both an image and its
Fourier spectrum to improve a CT image reconstructed from the SFR-Net output
using cross-domain contextual information. Quad-Net is trained on clinical
datasets to minimize a composite loss function. Quad-Net does not require
precise metal masks, which is of great importance in clinical practice. Our
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Quad-Net over the

These models are pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled corpus and then
fine-tuned in downstream tasks. However, as the inputs to pre-training and
downstream tasks are in different forms, it is hard to fully explore the
knowledge of pre-trained models. Besides, the performance of fine-tuning
strongly relies on the amount of downstream data, while in practice, the
scenarios with scarce data are common. Recent studies in the natural language
processing (NLP) field show that prompt tuning, a new paradigm for tuning,
alleviates the above issues and achieves promising results in various NLP
tasks. In prompt tuning, the prompts inserted during tuning provide
task-specific knowledge, which is especially beneficial for tasks with
relatively scarce data. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the usage and
effect of prompt tuning in code intelligence tasks. We conduct prompt tuning on
popular pre-trained models CodeBERT and CodeT5 and experiment with three code
intelligence tasks including defect prediction, code summarization, and code

outperforms fine-tuning in all three tasks. In addition, prompt tuning shows
great potential in low-resource scenarios, e.g., improving the BLEU scores of
fine-tuning by more than 26\% on average for code summarization. Our results
suggest that instead of fine-tuning, we could adapt prompt tuning for code

existing semi-supervised learning methods, adversarial training based methods
distinguish samples from different sources by learning the data distribution of

predictions. We argue that the current performance restrictions for such
approaches are the problems of feature extraction and learning preference. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised adversarial method called Patch
Confidence Adversarial Training (PCA) for medical image segmentation. Rather
than single scalar classification results or pixel-level confidence maps, our
proposed discriminator creates patch confidence maps and classifies them at the
scale of the patches. The prediction of unlabeled data learns the pixel
structure and context information in each patch to get enough gradient
feedback, which aids the discriminator in convergent to an optimal state and
improves semi-supervised segmentation performance. Furthermore, at the
discriminator's input, we supplement semantic information constraints on
images, making it simpler for unlabeled data to fit the expected data
distribution. Extensive experiments on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis

are reconsidered in light of a purely Carrollian perspective in this paper. In
direct analogy to the covariant transformation laws of the Lorentzian tensors,
the flat Carrollian multiplets are defined and their conformal transformation
properties are established. A first-principle derivation of the Ward identities
in a $1+1$D Carrollian conformal field theory (CCFT) is presented. This
derivation introduces the use of the complex contour-integrals (over the
space-variable) that provide a strong analytic handle to CCFT. The temporal
step-function factors appearing in these Ward identities enable the translation
of the operator product expansions (OPEs) into the language of the operator
commutation relations and vice versa, via a contour-integral prescription.
Motivated by the properties of these step-functions, the $i\epsilon$-forms of
the Ward identities and OPEs are proposed that permit for the hassle-free use
of the algebraic properties of the latter. Finally, utilizing the computational
techniques developed, it is shown that the modes of the quantum energy-momentum

infinite-dimensional $1+1$D Carrollian conformal algebra.

  Adversarial Transferability",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although many methods have been proposed to enhance the transferability of
adversarial perturbations, these methods are designed in a heuristic manner,
and the essential mechanism for improving adversarial transferability is still
unclear. This paper summarizes the common mechanism shared by twelve previous
transferability-boosting methods in a unified view, i.e., these methods all
reduce game-theoretic interactions between regional adversarial perturbations.
To this end, we focus on the attacking utility of all interactions between
regional adversarial perturbations, and we first discover and prove the
negative correlation between the adversarial transferability and the attacking
utility of interactions. Based on this discovery, we theoretically prove and
empirically verify that twelve previous transferability-boosting methods all
reduce interactions between regional adversarial perturbations. More crucially,
we consider the reduction of interactions as the essential reason for the
enhancement of adversarial transferability. Furthermore, we design the
interaction loss to directly penalize interactions between regional adversarial
perturbations during attacking. Experimental results show that the interaction
loss significantly improves the transferability of adversarial perturbations.

is the key mechanism of initiation and progression of many major diseases. The
formation and maintenance of calcium homeostasis are closely related to the
spatial distribution of calcium channels. In the current paper, a theoretical
framework is established by abstracting the spatial distribution of the calcium
channels as a nonlinear biological complex network with calcium channels as
nodes and Ca$^{2+}$ as edges. A dynamical model for a RyR is adopted to
investigate the effect of spatial distribution on calcium oscillation. The
mean-field model can be well reproduced from the complete graph and dense
Erd\""os-R\'enyi network. The synchronization of RyRs is found important to
generate a global calcium oscillation. The clique graph with a cluster
structure can not produce a global oscillation due to the failure of
synchronization between clusters. A more realistic geometric network is
constructed in a two-dimensional plane based on the experimental information
about the RyR arrangement of clusters and the frequency distribution of cluster
sizes. Different from the clique graph, the global oscillation can be generated
with reasonable parameters on the geometric network. The simulation also
suggests that existence of small clusters and rogue RyR's plays an important
role in the maintenance of global calcium oscillation through keeping
synchronization between large clusters. Such results support the heterogeneous
distribution of RyR's with different-size clusters, which is helpful to
understand recent observations with super resolution nanoscale imaging
techniques. The current theoretical framework can also be extent to investigate
other phenomena in calcium signal transduction.

merits in accuracy and completeness, meantime reducing the demand for expensive

learning-based MVS problem that only a tiny part of the MVS data is attached
with dense depth ground truth. However, due to huge variation of scenarios and
flexible setting in views, semi-supervised MVS problem (Semi-MVS) may break the
basic assumption in classic semi-supervised learning, that unlabeled data and
labeled data share the same label space and data distribution. To handle these
issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised MVS framework, namely SE-MVS. For
the simple case that the basic assumption works in MVS data, consistency
regularization encourages the model predictions to be consistent between
original sample and randomly augmented sample via constraints on KL divergence.
For further troublesome case that the basic assumption is conflicted in MVS
data, we propose a novel style consistency loss to alleviate the negative
effect caused by the distribution gap. The visual style of unlabeled sample is
transferred to labeled sample to shrink the gap, and the model prediction of
generated sample is further supervised with the label in original labeled
sample. The experimental results on DTU, BlendedMVS, GTA-SFM, and
Tanks\&Temples datasets show the superior performance of the proposed method.
With the same settings in backbone network, our proposed SE-MVS outperforms its
fully-supervised and unsupervised baselines.

power injection to minimize the system losses. In this paper, we extend these
algorithms to ensure the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of the
converters, and we integrate them with state-of-the-art Wavelet-CNN-LSTM RES

population should be optimally configured to efficiently encode information
about a stimulus subject to biophysical constraints. This poses the question of
how multiple neurons that together represent a common stimulus should optimize
their tuning curves to provide the optimal stimulus encoding. Previous
theoretical approaches have solved this problem with binary neurons that have a
step-function tuning curve, and have assumed that spike generation is noisy and
follows a Poisson process. Here we derive a general theory of optimal
population codes with biologically realistic neuronal tuning curves and noise
by maximizing the Shannon mutual information between a stimulus and the
neuronal spiking output. We demonstrate that the information does not depend on
how the population is divided into ON and OFF cells described by monotonically
increasing vs. decreasing tuning curves, respectively, independent of the shape
of the tuning curves and the nature of the spiking noise. Finally, we derive a
relationship for how these tuning curves should be distributed in stimulus
space.

an image based on an input mask. They may face problems when dealing with
different perturbations on different semantic regions without available input
masks. To deal with the problem that one image has been pasted with several
foregrounds coming from different images and needs to harmonize them towards
different domain directions without any mask as input, we propose a new
semantic-guided multi-mask image harmonization task. Different from the
previous single-mask image harmonization task, each inharmonious image is
perturbed with different methods according to the semantic segmentation masks.
Two challenging benchmarks, HScene and HLIP, are constructed based on $150$ and
$19$ semantic classes, respectively. Furthermore, previous baselines focus on
regressing the exact value for each pixel of the harmonized images. The
generated results are in the `black box' and cannot be edited. In this work, we
propose a novel way to edit the inharmonious images by predicting a series of
operator masks. The masks indicate the level and the position to apply a
certain image editing operation, which could be the brightness, the saturation,
and the color in a specific dimension. The operator masks provide more
flexibility for users to edit the image further. Extensive experiments verify
that the operator mask-based network can further improve those state-of-the-art
methods which directly regress RGB images when the perturbations are
structural. Experiments have been conducted on our constructed benchmarks to
verify that our proposed operator mask-based framework can locate and modify
the inharmonious regions in more complex scenes. Our code and models are

learning-based methods are proposed, especially reinforcement learning (RL)
methods. However, current RL methods need retraining when the scenarios change.
In other words, current RL methods cannot reuse accumulated knowledge. They
forget learned knowledge when new scenarios are given. To solve this problem,
we propose a hierarchical framework that can autonomously accumulate and reuse
knowledge. The proposed method combines the idea of motion primitives (MPs)
with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). It decomposes complex problems
into multiple basic subtasks to reduce the difficulty. The proposed method and
other baseline methods are tested in a challenging intersection scenario based
on the CARLA simulator. The intersection scenario contains three different
subtasks that can reflect the complexity and uncertainty of real traffic flow.

frames. These distortions become significant under fast camera/scene motions.
Undoing effects of RS is sometimes addressed as a spatial problem, where
objects need to be rectified/displaced in order to generate their correct
global shutter (GS) frame. However, the cause of the RS effect is inherently
temporal, not spatial. In this paper we propose a space-time solution to the RS
problem. We observe that despite the severe differences between their xy
frames, a RS video and its corresponding GS video tend to share the exact same
xt slices -- up to a known sub-frame temporal shift. Moreover, they share the
same distribution of small 2D xt-patches, despite the strong temporal aliasing
within each video. This allows to constrain the GS output video using
video-specific constraints imposed by the RS input video. Our algorithm is
composed of 3 main components: (i) Dense temporal upsampling between
consecutive RS frames using an off-the-shelf method, (which was trained on
regular video sequences), from which we extract GS ""proposals"". (ii) Learning
to correctly merge an ensemble of such GS ""proposals"" using a dedicated
MergeNet. (iii) A video-specific zero-shot optimization which imposes the
similarity of xt-patches between the GS output video and the RS input video.
Our method obtains state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, both
numerically and visually, despite being trained on a small synthetic RS/GS
dataset. Moreover, it generalizes well to new complex RS videos with motion
types outside the distribution of the training set (e.g., complex non-rigid
motions) -- videos which competing methods trained on much more data cannot
handle well. We attribute these generalization capabilities to the combination
of external and internal constraints.

46(6):3351--3398, 2018) studied the optimal transport problem with
supermartingale constraints and introduced two canonical couplings, namely the
increasing and decreasing transport plans, that are optimal for a large class
of cost functions. In the present paper we provide an explicit construction of
the decreasing coupling $\pi^D$ by establishing a Brenier-type result: (a
generalised version of) $\pi^D$ concentrates on the graphs of two functions.
  Our construction is based on the concept of the supermartingale
\textit{shadow} measure and requires a suitable extension of the results by
Juillet (Stability of the shadow projection and the left-curtain coupling, Ann.

prove the stability of the supermartingale shadow measure with respect to
initial and target measures $\mu,\nu$, introduce an infinite family of lifted
supermartingale couplings that arise via shadow measure, and show how to
explicitly determine the `martingale points' of each such coupling.

quantum mechanics introduced by pioneer work of Einstein, Schr\""odinger, and
others. It has been shown to be NP-hard; so it must be solve by efficient
heuristic algorithms such as the block improvement method (BIM). This paper
focuses on the maximization of bi-quadratic forms, which leads to a rank-one
approximation problem that is equivalent to computing the M-spectral radius and
its corresponding eigenvectors. Specifically, we provide a tight upper bound of
the M-spectral radius for nonnegative fourth-order partially symmetric (PS)
tensors, which can be considered as an approximation of the M-spectral radius.
Furthermore, we showed that the proposed upper bound can be obtained more
efficiently, if the nonnegative fourth-order PS-tensors is a member of certain
monoid semigroups. Furthermore, as an extension of the proposed upper bound, we
derive the exact solutions of the M-spectral radius and its corresponding
M-eigenvectors for certain classes of fourth-order PS-tensors. Lastly, as an
application of the proposed bound, we obtain a practically testable sufficient
condition for nonsingular elasticity M-tensors with strong ellipticity
condition.
  We conduct several numerical experiments to demonstrate the utility of the
proposed results. The results show that: (a) our proposed method can attain a
tight upper bound of the M-spectral radius with little computational burden,
and (b) such tight and efficient upper bounds greatly enhance the convergence
speed of the BIM-algorithm, allowing it to be applicable for large-scale
problems in applications.

applied to learn the physical processes and obtain a sparse representation of
the solution given a large snapshot space. Assume that there is a rich class of
precomputed basis functions that can be used to approximate the quantity of
interest. We then design a neural network architecture to learn the
coefficients of solutions in the spaces which are spanned by these basis
functions. The information of the basis functions are incorporated in the loss
function, which minimizes the differences between the downscaled reduced order
solutions and reference solutions at multiple time steps. The network contains
multiple submodules and the solutions at different time steps can be learned
simultaneously. We propose some strategies in the learning framework to
identify important degrees of freedom. To find a sparse solution
representation, a soft thresholding operator is applied to enforce the sparsity
of the output coefficient vectors of the neural network. To avoid
over-simplification and enrich the approximation space, some degrees of freedom
can be added back to the system through a greedy algorithm. In both scenarios,
that is, removing and adding degrees of freedom, the corresponding network
connections are pruned or reactivated guided by the magnitude of the solution
coefficients obtained from the network outputs. The proposed adaptive learning

a good basis selection and accurate approximation. More numerical tests are
performed on two-phase multiscale flow problems to show the capability and
interpretability of the proposed method on complicated applications.

motions of the stars, with stars having radially outward (mass loss) or inward
(mass accretion) bulk motions. Here we test the feasibility of using the mean
radial motion of stars in the stellar halo to constrain the rate of change of
mass in the Galaxy, for example, due to decay of dark matter into invisible
dark sector particles or more conservatively from the settling of baryons. In
the current $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of structure formation, the stellar halo is
formed by accretion of satellites onto the host galaxy. Over time, as the
satellites disrupt and phase mix, the mean radial motion $\langle V_{R}
\rangle$ of the stellar halo is eventually expected to be close to zero. But
most halos have substructures due to incomplete mixing of specific accretion
events and this can lead to nonzero $\langle V_{R} \rangle$ in them. Using
simulations, we measure the mean radial motion, $\langle V_{R} \rangle$, of
stars in 13 $\Lambda$CDM stellar halos lying in a spherical shell of radius 30
kpc. We find that for most halos, the shell motion is quite small, with 75\% of
halos having $\langle V_{R}\rangle \lesssim 1.2 \ {\rm km}s^{-1}$. When
substructures are removed by using a clustering algorithm, $\langle
V_{R}\rangle$ is reduced even further, with 75\% of halos having $\langle
V_{R}\rangle \lesssim 0.6 \ {\rm km}s^{-1}$. A value of $\langle V_{R}\rangle
\approx 0.6 \ {\rm km}s^{-1}$ can be attained corresponding to a galactic mass
loss rate of 2\% per Gyr. We show that this can place constraints on dark
matter decay parameters such as the decay lifetime and the kick velocity that
is imparted to the daughter particle. The advent of all-sky stellar surveys
involving millions to billions of stars is encouraging for detecting signatures
of dark matter decay.

galaxies at these high redshifts. Covering $1.4$deg$^2$, our COSMOS catalogues
were constructed from the latest UltraVISTA data release (DR4) combined with
the final Spitzer/IRAC COSMOS images and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program DR2 release. We identify $17$ new $7.5<z<10$ candidate sources, and
confirm $15$ previously published candidates. Using deblended photometry
extracted by fitting surface brightness models on multi-band images, we select
four candidates which would be rejected using fixed aperture photometry. We
test the robustness of all our candidates by comparing six different
photometric redshift estimates. Finally, we compute the galaxy UV luminosity
function in three redshift bins centred at $z=8,9,10$. We find no clear
evolution of the number density of the brightest galaxies $M_\text{UV}<-21.5$,
in agreement with previous works. Rapid changes in the quenching efficiency or
attenuation by dust could explain such lack of evolution between $z\sim 8$ and
$z\sim 9. A spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts, already planned with
JWST and the Keck telescopes, will be essential to confirm our results.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-label learning, a particular case of multi-task learning where a
single data point is associated with multiple target labels, it was widely
assumed in the literature that, to obtain best accuracy, the dependence among
the labels should be explicitly modeled. This premise led to a proliferation of
methods offering techniques to learn and predict labels together, for example
where the prediction for one label influences predictions for other labels.
Even though it is now acknowledged that in many contexts a model of dependence
is not required for optimal performance, such models continue to outperform
independent models in some of those very contexts, suggesting alternative
explanations for their performance beyond label dependence, which the
literature is only recently beginning to unravel. Leveraging and extending
recent discoveries, we turn the original premise of multi-label learning on its
head, and approach the problem of joint-modeling specifically under the absence
of any measurable dependence among task labels; for example, when task labels
come from separate problem domains. We shift insights from this study towards
building an approach for transfer learning that challenges the long-held
assumption that transferability of tasks comes from measurements of similarity
between the source and target domains or models. This allows us to design and
test a method for transfer learning, which is model driven rather than purely
data driven, and furthermore it is black box and model-agnostic (any base model
class can be considered). We show that essentially we can create
task-dependence based on source-model capacity. The results we obtain have
important implications and provide clear directions for future work, both in
the areas of multi-label and transfer learning.

regulated by distributed secondary frequency control. Secondly, voltage is
regulated by distributed average voltage control and decentralized individual
voltage control. It offers a tunable trade-off between voltage regulation,
active, and reactive power sharing accuracy. Therefore, it avoids the abuse of
sacrificing reactive power sharing accuracy for exact voltage regulation which
is a common issue of existing methods. The proposed method is implemented in a

  Generation","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique to enhance
the performance of physical-layer key generation (PKG) due to its ability to
smartly customize the radio environments. Existing RIS-assisted PKG methods are
mainly based on the idealistic assumption of an independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) channel model at both the transmitter and the RIS.
However, the i.i.d. model is inaccurate for a typical RIS in an isotropic
scattering environment. Also, neglecting the existence of channel spatial
correlation would degrade the PKG performance. In this paper, we establish a
general spatially correlated channel model in multi-antenna systems and propose
a new PKG framework based on the transmit and the reflective beamforming at the
base station (BS) and the RIS. Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression
for characterizing the key generation rate (KGR) and obtain a globally optimal
solution of the beamformers to maximize the KGR. Furthermore, we analyze the
KGR performance difference between the one adopting the assumption of the
i.i.d. model and that of the spatially correlated model. It is found that the
beamforming designed for the correlated model outperforms that for the i.i.d.
model while the KGR gain increases with the channel correlation. Simulation
results show that compared to existing methods based on the i.i.d. fading
model, our proposed method achieves about $5$ dB performance gain when the BS
antenna correlation $\rho$ is $0.3$ and the RIS element spacing is half of the
wavelength.

learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter
server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from
spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally,
the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to
correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each

(RL)-based dialogue policy. Its favorable performance and wise action decisions
rely on an accurate estimation of action values. The overestimation problem is
a widely known issue of RL since its estimate of the maximum action value is
larger than the ground truth, which results in an unstable learning process and
suboptimal policy. This problem is detrimental to RL-based dialogue policy
learning. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a dynamic partial
average estimator (DPAV) of the ground truth maximum action value. DPAV
calculates the partial average between the predicted maximum action value and
minimum action value, where the weights are dynamically adaptive and
problem-dependent. We incorporate DPAV into a deep Q-network as the dialogue
policy and show that our method can achieve better or comparable results
compared to top baselines on three dialogue datasets of different domains with
a lower computational load. In addition, we also theoretically prove the
convergence and derive the upper and lower bounds of the bias compared with
those of other methods.

progresses made in the field. Secondly, we extensively investigated the
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction for a media system that moves with
an acceleration. We concluded that, the newly developed MEs-f-MDMS are required
for describing the electrodynamics inside a media that has a finite size and
volume and move with and even without acceleration. The classical Maxwell's
equations are to describe the electrodynamics in vacuum space when the media in
the nearby are moving.

This paper proposes a framework Contrastive Vision Transformer (CVT), which
designs a focal contrastive learning strategy based on a transformer

Specifically, we design a new external attention mechanism for online CL that
implicitly captures previous tasks' information. Besides, CVT contains
learnable focuses for each class, which could accumulate the knowledge of
previous classes to alleviate forgetting. Based on the learnable focuses, we
design a focal contrastive loss to rebalance contrastive learning between new

CVT contains a dual-classifier structure for decoupling learning current
classes and balancing all observed classes. The extensive experimental results
show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with even fewer

is possible to perform material design rationally. Liquid-metal embedded

variational autoencoder network (VAE). The design parameters are the
microstructural descriptors that are physically meaningful and have affine

machine learning (ML) model is trained on a generated dataset of
microstructural descriptors with their multifunctional property quantities as
their labels. Sobol sequence is used for in-silico Design of Experiment (DoE)

microstructure realizations via a packing algorithm. The mechanical responses
of the generated microstructures are simulated using a previously developed
Finite Element (FE) model, considering the surface tension induced by LM
inclusions, while the linear thermal and dielectric constants are homogenized
with the help of our in-house Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) package. Following
the training by minimization of an appropriate loss function, the VAE encoder
acts as the surrogate of numerical solvers of the multifunctional
homogenizations, and its decoder is used for the material design. Our results

to show that the response of a material to irradiation is generally anisotropic
that depends on the ion-beam direction, and should be described using tensorial
quantities. We demonstrate that accelerator-based ion beam irradiation,
combined with the intrinsic lattice anisotropy and externally induced
anisotropy (such as anisotropic mechanical loadings), causes radiation-actuated
shear transformation strains in addition to hydrostatic expansion. We map out
these complex correlations for several materials. Radiation-induced defects are
shown to be responsible for residual shear stresses in the manner of Eshelby
inclusion transformation. We propose such tensorial response model should be
