  during Physical Human-Robot Interaction",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Humans can leverage physical interaction to teach robot arms. This physical
interaction takes multiple forms depending on the task, the user, and what the
robot has learned so far. State-of-the-art approaches focus on learning from a
single modality, or combine multiple interaction types by assuming that the
robot has prior information about the human's intended task. By contrast, in
this paper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that unites learning from
demonstrations, corrections, and preferences. Our approach makes no assumptions
about the tasks the human wants to teach the robot; instead, we learn a reward
model from scratch by comparing the human's inputs to nearby alternatives. We
first derive a loss function that trains an ensemble of reward models to match
the human's demonstrations, corrections, and preferences. The type and order of
feedback is up to the human teacher: we enable the robot to collect this
feedback passively or actively. We then apply constrained optimization to
convert our learned reward into a desired robot trajectory. Through simulations
and a user study we demonstrate that our proposed approach more accurately
learns manipulation tasks from physical human interaction than existing
baselines, particularly when the robot is faced with new or unexpected
objectives. Videos of our user study are available at:

be too rapid to arrest before it triggers undesirable responses from generators

equipment damage. Electric utilities, to combat this, study inertia adequacy in
systems that are particularly vulnerable. This process, involving detailed
transient simulations, usually leads to a notion of a system-wide inertia
floor. Ongoing questions in this analysis are in how to set the inertial floor
and to what extent the location of frequency control resources matters. This
paper proposes a new analysis technique that quantifies theoretical locational
rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) as a computationally efficient screening
algorithm scalable to large systems. An additional challenge in moving this
area forward is the lack of high-quality, public benchmark dynamics cases. This
paper presents a synthetic case for such purposes and a methodology for
validation, to ensure that it is well suited to inertia adequacy studies to
improve electric grid performance.

that shot sensitivity is broadly present across metric-based few-shot learners,

built-in robustness to varying test shot. More importantly, a simple,
previously known but greatly overlooked class of approaches based on cosine
distance consistently and greatly improves robustness to shot variation, by
removing sensitivity to sample noise. We derive cosine alternatives to popular

performance measured on unseen data excluded from the training phase. Along
with the development of DNNs, the generalization performance converges to the

metric. The robustness against adversarial attack has been used as an
additional metric to evaluate DNNs by measuring their vulnerability. However,
few studies have been performed to analyze the adversarial robustness in terms
of the geometry in DNNs. In this work, we perform an empirical study to analyze
the internal properties of DNNs that affect model robustness under adversarial
attacks. In particular, we propose the novel concept of the Populated Region

the internal properties of DNNs in a practical setting. From systematic
experiments with the proposed concept, we provide empirical evidence to
validate that a low PRS ratio has a strong relationship with the adversarial

research. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and
it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical
internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed
globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over
long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize
quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in
order to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the
limitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work
provides an initial step towards this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory
of near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we
show that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model
protocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific
implementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links
introduced in prior work, and by providing new results on policies for
elementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. In particular, we
show that the well-known memory-cutoff policy is optimal in the steady-state
limit. Then we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a
quantum network protocol in which we wait for all elementary links to be active
before creating end-to-end links. We then provide an extension of the MDP
formalism to two elementary links, which is useful for analyzing more
sophisticated quantum network protocols. Here, as new results, we derive linear
programming relaxations that allow us to obtain optimal steady-state policies
with respect to the expected fidelity and waiting time of the end-to-end link.

sampling solutions. We conclude that entanglement plays a minor role in the
MaxCut and Exact Cover 3 problems studied here since the simulated algorithm

  1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds",,,,,"math.DG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown in by Huang-Lucia-Tarantello [17] that, for given $\vert c
\vert <1$, the moduli space of constant mean curvature (CMC) $c$-immersions of
a closed orientable surface of genus $\mathfrak{g} \geq 2$ into a hyperbolic
$3$-manifold can be parametrized by elements of the tangent bundle of the
corresponding Teichm\""uller space. This is attained by showing the unique
solvability of the Gauss-Codazzi equations governing (CMC) c-immersions. The
corresponding unique solution is identified as the global minimum (and only
critical point) of the Donaldson functional $D_t$ (introduced in [11]) given in
(1.3) with $t=1-c^{2}$.
  When $\vert c \vert \geq 1$ (i.e. $t\leq 0$), so far nothing is known about
the existence of analogous (CMC) c-immersions. Indeed, for $t\leq 0$ the
functional $D_{t}$ may no longer be bounded from below and evident
non-existence situations do occur.
  Already the case $\vert c \vert =1$ (i.e. $t=0$) appears rather involved and
actually (CMC) 1-immersions can be attained only as ""limits"" of (CMC)
c-immersions for $\vert c \vert \longrightarrow 1^{-}$. To handle this
situation, here we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of minimizers of $D_{t}$ as
$t \longrightarrow 0^{+}$.
  We use an accurate asymptotic analysis to describe possible blow-up
phenomena. In this way, we can relate the existence of (CMC) 1-immersions to
the Kodaira map. As a consequence, we obtain the first existence and uniqueness
result about (CMC) 1-immersions of surfaces of genus $\mathfrak{g}=2$ into
hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

ideal incompressible fluid conserve energy if $u (\cdot ,t) \in C^{0, \theta}
(\mathbb{T}^3)$ with $\theta > \frac{1}{3}$. In this paper, we prove an
analogue of Onsager's conjecture for several subgrid scale $\alpha$-models of
turbulence. In particular we find the required H\""older regularity of the
solutions that ensures the conservation of energy-like quantities (either the
$H^1 (\mathbb{T}^3)$ or $L^2 (\mathbb{T}^3)$ norms) for these models. We
establish such results for the Leray-$\alpha$ model, the Euler-$\alpha$
equations (also known as the inviscid Camassa-Holm equations or Lagrangian
averaged Euler equations), the modified Leray-$\alpha$ model, the
Clark-$\alpha$ model and finally the magnetohydrodynamic Leray-$\alpha$ model.
In a sense, all these models are inviscid regularisations of the Euler
equations; and formally converge to the Euler equations as the regularisation
length scale $\alpha \rightarrow 0^+$. Different H\""older exponents, smaller
than $1/3$, are found for the regularity of solutions of these models (they are
also formulated in terms of Besov and Sobolev spaces) that guarantee the
conservation of the corresponding energy-like quantity. This is expected due to
the smoother nonlinearity compared to the Euler equations. These results form a
contrast to the universality of the $1/3$ Onsager exponent found for general
systems of conservation laws by (Gwiazda et al., 2018; Bardos et al., 2019).

the laboratory rotational spectrum of vinyl isocyanate into the millimeter wave
region and to undertake a check for its presence in the high-mass star forming
region Sgr B2. The rotational spectrum of vinyl isocyanate was recorded in the
frequency regions 127.5-218 and 285-330 GHz using the Prague millimeter wave
spectrometer. The spectral analysis was supported by high-level
quantum-chemical calculations. We assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium to
compute synthetic spectra of vinyl isocyanate and to search for it in the
ReMoCA survey performed with ALMA toward Sgr B2(N). We also searched for ethyl
isocyanate in the same source. Accurate values for the rotational and
centrifugal distortion constants are reported for the ground vibrational states
of trans and cis vinyl isocyanate. We report nondetections of vinyl and ethyl
isocyanate toward the main hot core of Sgr B2(N). We find that vinyl and ethyl
isocyanate are at least 11 and 3 times less abundant than methyl isocyanate in
this source, respectively. Although the precise formation mechanism of
interstellar methyl isocyanate itself remains uncertain, we infer from existing
astrochemical models that our observational upper limit for the CH3NCO:C2H5NCO
ratio in Sgr B2(N) is consistent with ethyl isocyanate being formed on dust
grains via the abstraction or photodissociation of an H atom from methyl
isocyanate, followed by the addition of a methyl radical. The dominance of such
a process for ethyl isocyanate production, combined with the absence of an
analogous mechanism for vinyl isocyanate, would indicate that the ratio
C2H3NCO:C2H5NCO should be rather less than unity.

acquisition and recovery technique that relies on linear operations. However,
the actual measurements of signals have to be quantized before storing or
processing. 1(One)-bit compressed sensing is a heavily quantized version of
compressed sensing, where each linear measurement of a signal is reduced to
just one bit: the sign of the measurement. Once enough of such measurements are
collected, the recovery problem in 1-bit compressed sensing aims to find the
original signal with as much accuracy as possible. The recovery problem is
related to the traditional ""halfspace-learning"" problem in learning theory.
  For recovery of sparse vectors, a popular reconstruction method from 1-bit
measurements is the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm. The
algorithm is a simple projected sub-gradient descent method, and is known to
converge well empirically, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. The
convergence property of BIHT was not theoretically justified, except with an
exorbitantly large number of measurements (i.e., a number of measurement
greater than $\max\{k^{10}, 24^{48}, k^{3.5}/\epsilon\}$, where $k$ is the
sparsity, $\epsilon$ denotes the approximation error, and even this expression
hides other factors). In this paper we show that the BIHT algorithm converges
with only $\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ measurements. Note that, this
dependence on $k$ and $\epsilon$ is optimal for any recovery method in 1-bit
compressed sensing. With this result, to the best of our knowledge, BIHT is the
only practical and efficient (polynomial time) algorithm that requires the
optimal number of measurements in all parameters (both $k$ and $\epsilon$).
This is also an example of a gradient descent algorithm converging to the
correct solution for a nonconvex problem, under suitable structural conditions.

distinct, flexible design targets like scattering due to specific multipoles in
narrow spectral windows. Varying the design problem does not require any

semi-supervised object detectors, underpinned by pseudo labelling, are
appealing. However, handling confusing samples is nontrivial: discarding
valuable confusing samples would compromise the model generalisation while
using them for training would exacerbate the confirmation bias issue caused by
inevitable mislabelling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to use
confusing samples proactively without label correction. Specifically, a virtual
category (VC) is assigned to each confusing sample such that they can safely
contribute to the model optimisation even without a concrete label. It is
attributed to specifying the embedding distance between the training sample and
the virtual category as the lower bound of the inter-class distance. Moreover,
we also modify the localisation loss to allow high-quality boundaries for
location regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VC
learning significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art, especially with small
amounts of available labels.

via manual creation or using 3D scanning tools. Therefore, techniques to
reconstruct articulated 3D objects from 2D images are crucial and highly
useful. In this work, we propose a practical problem setting to estimate 3D
pose and shape of animals given only a few (10-30) in-the-wild images of a
particular animal species (say, horse). Contrary to existing works that rely on
pre-defined template shapes, we do not assume any form of 2D or 3D ground-truth
annotations, nor do we leverage any multi-view or temporal information.
Moreover, each input image ensemble can contain animal instances with varying
poses, backgrounds, illuminations, and textures. Our key insight is that 3D
parts have much simpler shape compared to the overall animal and that they are
robust w.r.t. animal pose articulations. Following these insights, we propose
LASSIE, a novel optimization framework which discovers 3D parts in a
self-supervised manner with minimal user intervention. A key driving force
behind LASSIE is the enforcing of 2D-3D part consistency using self-supervisory
deep features. Experiments on Pascal-Part and self-collected in-the-wild animal
datasets demonstrate considerably better 3D reconstructions as well as both 2D
and 3D part discovery compared to prior arts. Project page:

the ground state is populated with bunched photons. In addition, it is shown
that the diamagnetic $\mathbf{A}^2$ term is necessary for the stability of the

present the simulation framework and the modelling of one complex type of

cause intertemporal constraints for flexibility coordination that lead to
aggregation errors in case flexibility is aggregated from heterogeneous groups

drones cooperate to serve customers in the minimum amount of time. The drones
are launched and retrieved by the truck at customer locations, and each of
their flights must not consume more energy than allowed by their batteries.
Most problem settings in the literature restrict the feasible truck routes to
cycles, i.e., closed paths, which never visit a node more than once. Revisiting
a node, however, may lower the time required to serve all the customers.
Additionally, we observe that optimal solutions for the TSP-mD may retraverse
arcs, i.e., optimal truck routes may contain the same arcs multiple times. We
refer to such solutions as arc-retraversing, and include them in our solution
space by modeling the truck route as a closed walk. We describe Euclidean
instances where all the optimal solutions are arc-retraversing. The necessity
of arc retraversals does not seem to have been investigated in previous
studies, and those that allow node revisits seem to assume that there always
exists an optimal solution without arc retraversals. We prove that under
certain conditions, which are commonly met in the literature, this assumption
is correct. When these conditions are not met, however, excluding
arc-retraversing solutions might result in an increase of the optimal value; we
identify cases where a priori and a posteriori upper bounds hold on such
increase. Finally, we prove that there is no polynomial-time heuristic that can
approximate the metric TSP-mD within a constant factor, unless P=NP. We
identify a (non-constant) approximation factor explicitly when the truck can
visit all the nodes.

evidence for the so-called ""centrifugal barrier,"" where the protostellar
envelope infall is gradually decelerated to a stop by the centrifugal force in
a region of super-Keplerian rotation. To test the concept of centrifugal
barrier, which was originally based on angular momentum conserving-collapse of
a rotating test particle around a fixed point mass, we carry out simple
axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar disk formation including
a minimum set of ingredients: self-gravity, rotation, and a prescribed
viscosity that enables the disk to accrete. We find that a super-Keplerian
region can indeed exist when the viscosity is relatively large but, unlike the
classic picture of centrifugal barrier, the infalling envelope material is not
decelerated solely by the centrifugal force. The region has more specific
angular momentum than its surrounding envelope material, which points to an
origin in outward angular momentum transport in the disk (subject to the
constraint of disk expansion by the infalling envelope), rather than the
spin-up of the envelope material envisioned in the classic picture as it falls
closer to the center in order to conserve angular momentum. For smaller
viscosities, the super-Keplerian rotation is weaker or non-existing. We
conclude that, despite the existence of super-Keplerian rotation in some

major relativistic effects, we present an analytical model of the GI

non-vanishing odd multipole anisotropies. Focusing particularly on the dipole
anisotropy, we show that the Doppler effect dominates at large scales, while
the gravitational redshift effect originated from the halo potential dominates
at the scales below $10$-$30\, {\rm Mpc}/h$, with the amplitude of the dipole
GI correlation being positive over all the scales. Also, we newly derive the
covariance matrix for the modelled GI dipole. Taking into account the full

helpful to detect relativistic effects in combination with the conventional

control problem which is a subject of intensive research activities in the
field of subsurface reservoir management. For this problem, the system is
partially observed since the data is only available at well locations.
Furthermore, the model parameters are highly uncertain due to sparsity of
available field data. In principle, RL algorithms are capable of learning
optimal action policies -- a map from states to actions -- to maximize a
numerical reward signal. In deep RL, this mapping from state to action is
parameterized using a deep neural network. In the RL formulation of the robust
optimal well control problem, the states are represented by saturation and
pressure values at well locations while the actions represent the valve
openings controlling the flow through wells. The numerical reward refers to the
total sweep efficiency and the uncertain model parameter is the subsurface
permeability field. The model parameter uncertainties are handled by
introducing a domain randomisation scheme that exploits cluster analysis on its
uncertainty distribution. We present numerical results using two
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, proximal policy optimization (PPO) and
advantage actor-critic (A2C), on two subsurface flow test cases representing
two distinct uncertainty distributions of permeability field. The results were
benchmarked against optimisation results obtained using differential evolution

by evaluating the learned control policy on unseen samples drawn from the
parameter uncertainty distribution that were not used during the training

Carinae reached its observed maximum X-ray flux on 7 January 2020, at a flux

plunge to its observed minimum flux, $0.03 \times 10^{-10}$ ergs s$^{-1}$

from minimum of only $\sim$16 days, the shortest X-ray minimum observed so far.
We provide new constraints of the ""deep"" and ""shallow"" minimum intervals.
Variations in the characteristic X-ray temperature of the hottest observed
X-ray emission indicate that the apex of the wind-wind ""bow shock"" enters the
companion's wind acceleration zone about 81 days before the start of the X-ray
minimum. There is a step-like increase in column density just before the X-ray
minimum, probably associated with the presence of dense clumps near the shock
apex. During recovery and after, the column density shows a smooth decline,
which agrees with previous $N_{H}$ measurements made by SWIFT at the same
orbital phase, indicating that changes in mass-loss rate are only a few percent
over the two cycles. Finally, we use the variations in the X-ray flux of the
outer ejecta seen by NICER to derive a kinetic X-ray luminosity of the ejecta
of $\sim 10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ near the time of the ""Great Eruption'.

by the strong lattice dissipation, in particular, the fractional scaling of the
emission rate with the lattice dissipation depends on the number of
excitations. The FQZ effect originates uniquely from the strong coupling of
emitters to the dissipation band-edge when the lattice is significantly
dissipative. Remarkably, we show it enables a novel mechanism for the strong
single-photon nonlinearity in the limit of weak interactions. Moreover, we
establish a general connection between the non-Hermitian bands of a dissipative
lattice and quantum statistics of emitter excitations quantified by the
second-order correlation functions, using the Keldysh formalism and scattering
theory. Our setup is experimentally feasible, advanced by recent progress on
tunable dissipative lattices in photonic and atomic systems. This work opens a
new perspective for the design and exploration of light-matter interactions. It
also showcases a route to uncover quantum many-body effect arising purely from

intertwined by anomalous fade-outs with periods of low but persistent epidemic
prevalence. These long-living epidemic states complicate epidemic control and
challenge current modeling approaches as classical epidemic models fail to
explain their emergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a simple
mechanism able to reproduce several features observed in real data.
Specifically, here we introduce a modification of the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in a meta-population framework where
a small inflow of infected individuals accounts for undetected internal or
imported cases. Focusing on a regime where this external seeding is so small
that cannot be detected from the analysis of epidemic curves, we find that
outbreaks of finite duration percolate in time resulting in overall low but
long-living epidemic states below and above the epidemic threshold. Using a
two-state description of the local dynamics, we can extract analytical
predictions for the phase space. The comparison with epidemic data demonstrates
that our model is able to reproduce some critical signatures observed in
COVID-19 spreading in England. Finally, our findings defy our understanding of
the concept of epidemic threshold and its relationship with outbreaks survival
for disease control.

can exclusively be addressed by nonperturbative calculations. Quantum computers
can solve problems for which well established QCD methods are inapplicable,
such as real-time evolution. We take a key step in exploring this possibility
by performing a real-time evolution of tetraquark and pentaquark physics in
one-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory on a superconducting quantum computer. Our
experiment represents a first quantum computation involving quarks with three
colour degrees of freedom, i.e. with the gauge group of QCD.

confirm this novel detection, we provide a new 475-825nm transmission spectrum
obtained with Magellan/IMACS, which indeed confirms the presence of a broad
sodium absorption feature. We find the same result when reanalyzing the
400-825nm VLT/FORS2 data. We also utilize synthetic data to test the
effectiveness of two common detrending techniques: (1) a Gaussian processes
(GP) routine, and (2) common-mode correction followed by polynomial correction
(CMC+Poly). We find that both methods poorly reproduce the absolute transit
depths but maintain their true spectral shape. This emphasizes the importance
of fitting for offsets when combining spectra from different sources or epochs.
Additionally, we find that for our datasets both methods give consistent
results, but CMC+Poly is more accurate and precise. We combine the
Magellan/IMACS and VLT/FORS2 spectra with literature 800-1644nm HST/WFC3
spectra, yielding a global spectrum from 400-1644nm. We used the PLATON and
Exoretrievals retrieval codes to interpret this spectrum, and find that both
yield relatively deeper pressures where the atmosphere is optically thick at
log-pressures between $1.3^{+1.0}_{-1.1}$ and 0.29$^{+1.86}_{-2.02}$ bars,
respectively. Exoretrievals finds a solar to super-solar ${\rm Na~I}$ and ${\rm

respectively, while PLATON finds an overall metallicity of
$log_{10}(Z/Z_{\odot}) = -0.49^{+1.0}_{-0.37}$dex. Therefore, our findings are
in agreement with literature and support the inference that the terminator of
WASP-96b has few aerosols obscuring prominent features in the optical to

sizes by leveraging different forms of weak supervision. This helps generalize
to novel objects at inference. Two popular forms of weak-supervision used in
open-vocabulary detection (OVD) include pretrained CLIP model and image-level
supervision. We note that both these modes of supervision are not optimally
aligned for the detection task: CLIP is trained with image-text pairs and lacks
precise localization of objects while the image-level supervision has been used
with heuristics that do not accurately specify local object regions. In this
work, we propose to address this problem by performing object-centric alignment
of the language embeddings from the CLIP model. Furthermore, we visually ground
the objects with only image-level supervision using a pseudo-labeling process
that provides high-quality object proposals and helps expand the vocabulary
during training. We establish a bridge between the above two object-alignment
strategies via a novel weight transfer function that aggregates their
complimentary strengths. In essence, the proposed model seeks to minimize the
gap between object and image-centric representations in the OVD setting. On the
COCO benchmark, our proposed approach achieves 36.6 AP50 on novel classes, an
absolute 8.2 gain over the previous best performance. For LVIS, we surpass the

plankton has long been explored as a potentially important source of ocean
mixing. However, direct evidence of enhanced mixing due to these migrations
remains challenging to obtain and inconclusive. These shortcomings are due to
the limitations of current measurement techniques, i.e., velocimetry
techniques, which require a priori knowledge of the precise aggregation
location and typically trigger animal avoidance behavior from introducing
instrumentation into the migration. Here we develop a new approach to overcome
these longstanding limitations by leveraging advancements in modern
magnetometry to detect the flow-induced magnetic fields that naturally arise
from seawater as it moves through the Earth's geomagnetic field. We derive
quantitative predictions showing that these flow-induced magnetic fields in the
vicinity of migrating aggregations have a strength proportional to the
integrated fluid transport due to the migration. Importantly these magnetic
signatures are potentially detectable remotely at a significant distance far
from the aggregation and region of moving fluid with emerging quantum-enhanced
magnetometry techniques such as Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond. These
results provide a new, testable framework for quantifying the significance of
fluid transport in the ocean due to swimming organisms that may finally resolve
a scientific debate with potentially enormous implications for our

aggregate measurements contain the total consumption of multiple loads, and the
existence of some loads is unknown. We develop two model-free disaggregation
approaches based on deterministic dictionary learning and Bayesian dictionary

patterns given partially labeled aggregate data. Therefore, our partial label
formulation is more applicable in the real world. Compared with deterministic

the uncertainty measure for the disaggregation results, at the cost of
increased computational complexity. All the methods are validated by numerical

compromised by open clusters, great distances, or dust extinction and used
Gaussian processes to arrive at a smooth, non-parametric estimate for the
underlying number density field. We find that the number density and velocity
fields depart significantly from an axisymmetric and mirror-symmetric model.
These departures, which include projections of the Gaia phase-space spiral,
signal the presence of local disturbances in the disk. We identify two features
that are present in both stellar number density and mean vertical velocity. One
of these features appears to be associated with the Local Spiral Arm. It is
most prominent at small heights and is largely symmetric across the mid-plane
of the disk. The density and velocity field perturbations are phase-shifted by
roughly a quarter wavelength, suggesting a breathing mode that is propagating
in the direction of Galactic longitude $l\sim 270$ deg. The second feature is a
gradient in the stellar number density and mean vertical velocity with respect
to Galactocentric radius. This feature, which extends across the entire region

density distribution, a semi-empirical description using the velocity

a small but finite absorption of radiation in order to guarantee the positivity
of the net entropy production and abide by the second law of thermodynamics. We
show, however, that the intra-band non-linear Hall effect arising from the
Berry curvature is a special kind of in-gap rectification mechanism that
behaves as a ``photo-voltaic demon'', namely it can operate as an ideal
reversible and dissipationless conveyor of energy between the radiation and an
external circuit. Its reversible nature allows for an interesting mode of
operation as an amplifier of circularly polarized light, whose efficiency can
approach 100%, and which could be technologically promising especially in the

radio galaxy (J1140-2629) in a galaxy proto-cluster at $z=2.16$. These yield
the most detailed polarimetric maps yet made of a high redshift radio galaxy.
The intrinsic polarization angles and Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs) reveal
coherent magnetic fields spanning the $\sim60$ kpc length of the jets, while
$\sim50$% fractional polarizations indicate these fields are well-ordered.
Source-frame absolute RM values of $\sim1,000$ rad/m/m are typical, and values
up to $\sim11,100$ rad/m/m are observed. The Faraday-rotating gas cannot be
well-mixed with the synchrotron-emitting gas, or stronger-than-observed
depolarization would occur. Nevertheless, an observed spatial coincidence
between a localized absolute RM enhancement of $\sim1,100$ rad/m/m, a bright
knot of Ly$\alpha$ emission, and a deviation of the radio jet provide direct
evidence for vigorous jet-gas interaction. We detect a large-scale RM gradient
totaling $\sim1,000$s rad/m/m across the width of the jet, suggesting a net
clockwise (as viewed from the AGN) toroidal magnetic field component exists at
10s-of-kpc-scales, which we speculate may be associated with the operation of a
Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery. We conclude the RMs are mainly generated in
a sheath of hot gas around the radio jet, rather than the ambient foreground
proto-cluster gas. The estimated magnetic field strength decreases by
successive orders-of-magnitude going from the jet hotspots ($\sim90$ $\mu$G) to
the jet sheath ($\sim10$ $\mu$G) to the ambient intracluster medium ($\sim1$
$\mu$G). Synthesizing our results, we propose that the Spiderweb radio galaxy
is actively magnetizing its surrounding proto-cluster environment, with

signatures. If, in the era prior to recombination, a relativistic species
becomes non-relativistic and is then depopulated in equilibrium, there can be
measurable impacts on the CMB as the entropy is transferred to lighter
relativistic particles. In particular, if this ``step'' occurs near $z\sim
20,000$, the model can naturally accommodate larger values of $H_0$. If this
stepped radiation is additionally coupled to dark matter, there can be a
meaningful impact on the matter power spectrum as dark matter can be coupled
via a species that becomes non-relativistic and depleted. This can naturally
lead to suppressed power at scales inside the sound horizon before the step,
while leaving conventional CDM signatures for power outside the sound horizon.
We study these effects and show such models can naturally provide lower values
of $S_8$ than scenarios without a step. This suggests these models may provide
an interesting framework to address the $S_8$ tension, both in concert with the
$H_0$ tension and without.

generally have reduced central dark matter densities, which reduces the total
acceleration in the central region when compared with CDM. We compare the RARs

inferred from CLASH observations. Our comparison shows that the cluster-scale
RAR in the CDM model provides an excellent match to the CLASH RAR obtained by
Tian et al. including the high-acceleration regime probed by the brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs). By contrast, models with a larger SIDM cross-section
yield increasingly poorer matches to the CLASH RAR. Excluding the BCG regions
results in a weaker but still competitive constraint on the SIDM cross-section.

efforts to model the GW signal from cosmic strings are often based on minimal
models, such as, eg, the Nambu--Goto action that describes cosmic strings as
exactly one-dimensional objects without any internal structure. In order to
arrive at more realistic predictions, it is therefore necessary to consider
nonminimal models that make an attempt at accounting for the microscopic

the GW spectrum emitted by current-carrying cosmic strings (CCCSs), which may

generalized version of the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model, which, in
addition to the mean velocity and correlation length of the string network,
also describes the evolution of a chiral (light-like) current. As we are able
to show, the solutions of the VOS equations imply a temporarily growing
fractional cosmic-string energy density, $\Omega_{\rm cs}$. This results in an
enhanced GW signal across a broad frequency interval, whose boundaries are
determined by the times of generation and decay of cosmic-string currents. Our
findings have important implications for GW experiments in the Hz to MHz band

magnitude below the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) estimate. This is several
orders of magnitude above the Eddington limit and above the limit for
neutrino-cooled accretion (i.e., hypercritical accretion, or HCA). Considering
that a binary system inside the CE of a third star accretes material at nearly
the same rate as a single object of the same total mass, we propose
stellar-evolution channels which form binary black hole (BBH) systems with its
component masses within the pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. Our
model is based on HCA onto the BBH system engulfed into the CE of a massive
tertiary star. Furthermore, we propose a mass transfer mode which allows to
store mass lost by the binary onto a third star. Through the use of population
synthesis simulations for the evolution of BBHs and standard binary-evolution
principles for the interaction with a tertiary star, we are able to produce
BBHs masses consistent with those estimated for GW190521. We also discuss the
massive binary system Mk34 as a possible progenitor of BBHs in the PISN gap, as
well as the spin distribution of the observed mergers in the gravitational-wave
catalog.

elements, standard finite element discretisations of the vector transport
equation typically have a low order of spatial accuracy. This paper describes
two schemes that improve the accuracy of transporting such vector-valued fields
on two-dimensional curved manifolds.
  The first scheme that is presented reconstructs the transported field in a
higher-order function space, where the transport equation is then solved. The
second scheme applies a mixed finite element formulation to the vector
transport equation, simultaneously solving for the transported field and its
vorticity. An approach to stabilising this mixed vector-vorticity formulation
is presented that uses a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. These
schemes are then demonstrated, along with their accuracy properties, through
some numerical tests. Two new test cases are used to assess the transport of
vector-valued fields on curved manifolds, solving the vector transport equation
in isolation. The improvement of the schemes is also shown through two standard
test cases for rotating shallow-water models.

hypothesized that improved detection efficiency requires a paradigm shift,
towards the unequal processing of proposals, assigning more computation to good

this as a learning problem where the goal is to assign operators to proposals,

learned as a function that maps each proposal embedding into a one-hot code

brain, and can solve a variety of difficult computational problems requiring
memory, error-correction, or selection [Hopfield, 1982, Maass et al., 2002,
Maass, 2011]. However, fully-connected RNNs contrast structurally with their
biological counterparts, which are extremely sparse (~0.1%). Motivated by the
neocortex, where neural connectivity is constrained by physical distance along
cortical sheets and other synaptic wiring costs, we introduce locality masked
RNNs (LM-RNNs) that utilize task-agnostic predetermined graphs with sparsity as
low as 4%. We study LM-RNNs in a multitask learning setting relevant to
cognitive systems neuroscience with a commonly used set of tasks, 20-Cog-tasks
[Yang et al., 2019]. We show through reductio ad absurdum that 20-Cog-tasks can
be solved by a small pool of separated autapses that we can mechanistically
analyze and understand. Thus, these tasks fall short of the goal of inducing
complex recurrent dynamics and modular structure in RNNs. We next contribute a
new cognitive multi-task battery, Mod-Cog, consisting of upto 132 tasks that
expands by 7-fold the number of tasks and task-complexity of 20-Cog-tasks.
Importantly, while autapses can solve the simple 20-Cog-tasks, the expanded
task-set requires richer neural architectures and continuous attractor
dynamics. On these tasks, we show that LM-RNNs with an optimal sparsity result
in faster training and better data-efficiency than fully connected networks.

enables the generation of aerobatics trajectories that exploit the entire
flight envelope, enabling agile maneuvering through the stall regime, sideways
uncoordinated flight, inverted flight etc. The method uses the differential
flatness property of the global tailsitter flying wing dynamics, which is
derived in this work. By performing snap minimization in the differentially

follows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required for a centralized

We
aim to systematically identify the massive cores which contain a hot core and
compare their molecular composition. We used ALMA high-spatial resolution (2500
au) data of W43-MM1 to identify line-rich protostellar cores and make a
comparative study of their temperature and molecular composition. The
identification of hot cores is based on both the spatial distribution of the
complex organic molecules and the contribution of molecular lines relative to
the continuum intensity. We rely on the analysis of CH3CN and CH3CCH to
estimate the temperatures of the selected cores. Finally, we rescale the
spectra of the different hot cores based on their CH3OCHO line intensities to
directly compare the detections and line intensities of the other species.
  W43-MM1 turns out to be a region rich in massive hot cores with at least 1
less massive and 7 massive hot cores. The excitation temperature of CH3CN is of
the same order for all of them (120-160 K). There is a factor of up to 30
difference in the intensity of the complex organic molecules (COMs) lines.
However the molecular emission of the hot cores appears to be the same within a
factor 2-3. This points towards both a similar chemical composition and
excitation of most of the COMs over these massive cores, which span about an
order of magnitude in core mass. In contrast, CH3CCH emission is found to
preferentially trace more the envelope, with a temperature ranging from 50 K to
90 K. Core 1, the most massive hot core of W43-MM1, shows a richer line
spectrum than the other cores. In core 2, the emission of O-bearing molecules
does not peak at the dust continuum core center; the blue and red shifted
emission correspond to the outflow lobes, suggesting a formation via the
sublimation of the ice mantles through shocks or UV irradiation on the walls of
the cavity.

OV dynamics that drives the memristive behavior is restricted to an internal
electromigration between TiOx and TaOy layers. Our work provides relevant
information for the design of reliable binary oxide memristive devices.

method is motivated by the observation that the specular highlight of an image
is sparsely distributed while the remaining diffuse reflection can be well
approximated by a linear combination of several distinct colors using a
low-rank and sparse decomposition framework. Unlike current solutions, our
tensor low-rank decomposition keeps the spatial structure of specular and
diffuse information which enables us to recover the diffuse image under strong
specular reflection or in saturated regions. We further define and impose a new
polarization regularization term as constraint on color channels. This
regularization boosts the performance of the method to recover an accurate
diffuse image by handling the color distortion, a common problem of
chromaticity-based methods, especially in case of strong specular reflection.
Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real polarization

accuracy of highlight specular removal, and outperform the competitive methods
to recover the diffuse image, especially in regions of strong specular

a complex fluid are inferred from the free or forced motion of embedded
colloidal probe particles. Theoretical machinery developed for forced-probe
microrheology of colloidal suspensions focused on either constant-force (CF) or
constant-velocity (CV) probes while in experiments neither the force nor the
kinematics of the probe is fixed. More importantly, the constraint of CF or CV
introduces a difficulty in the meaningful quantification of the fluctuations of
the probe due to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. It is known that for a
Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential well, the product of the
standard deviations of the trap force and the particle position is $d k_BT$ in
$d$ dimensions with $k_BT$ being the thermal energy. As a result, if the force
(position) is not allowed to fluctuate, the position (force) fluctuation
becomes infinite. To allow the measurement of fluctuations, in this work we
consider a microrheology model in which the embedded probe is dragged along by
a moving harmonic potential so that both its position and the trap force are
allowed to fluctuate. Starting from the full Smoluchowski equation governing
the dynamics of $N$ hard active Brownian particles, we derive a pair
Smoluchowski equation describing the dynamics of the probe as it interacts with
one bath particle by neglecting hydrodynamic interactions among particles in
the dilute limit. From this, we determine the mean and the variance (i.e.,
fluctuation) of the probe position in terms of the pair probability
distribution. We then characterize the behavior of the system in the limits of
both weak and strong trap. By taking appropriate limits, we show that our
generalized model can be reduced to the well-studied CF or CV microrheology
models.

optimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic
model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive
force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a
globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective
highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la
BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a
purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved
performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle
coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview
centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view
embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the
particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian
diffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on
ImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained

greedy computation of hypervolume content. We demonstrate that the method is
tunable with respect to expected accuracy, which can be forecast by an
information-theoretic measure of dataset similarity (divergence) between source

proposes a first-of-its-kind mathematical framework for the optimal integrated

incorporates essential nonlinearities such as voltage drops due to losses in

transmission lines, losses in HVDC converter stations, reactive power flow,
pressure drops in pipelines, and linepack, all of which play an important role
in determining the optimal infrastructure investment decision. Capturing these

size due to the relatively high temporal resolution of RES forecasts. This work
then leverages recent advancements in convex relaxations to instead solve a
tractable alternative in the form of a mixed-integer quadratically constrained

transmission distance and RES capacity is also thoroughly analysed on a
canonical two-node system. The integrated planning model is then demonstrated
on a real-world case study involving renewable energy zones in Australia.

neuronal elements, shaping diverse coactivation patterns that can be captured
as functional connectivity. While the link between structure and function
remains an ongoing challenge, the prevailing hypothesis is that the
structure-function relationship may itself be gradually decoupled along a
macroscale functional gradient spanning unimodal to transmodal regions.
However, this hypothesis is strongly constrained by the underlying models which
may neglect requisite signaling mechanisms. Here, we transform the structural
connectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific
diffusion patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary
markedly under different signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency
eigenmodes, which are considered sufficient to capture the essence of the
functional network, contribute little to functional connectivity reconstruction
in transmodal regions, resulting in structure-function decoupling along the
unimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are
usually on the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and
random dynamical patterns, contribute significantly to functional connectivity
prediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually convergent
structure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although
the information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it
effectively enhances the structure-function correspondence by 35% in unimodal
regions and 56% in transmodal regions. Altogether, our findings suggest that
the structure-function divergence in transmodal areas may not be an intrinsic
property of brain organization, but can be narrowed through multiplexed and
regionally specialized signaling mechanisms.

platform benefits from the high-carrier mobility and minimal free carrier

expression of emotion and to human communication more generally. This year's
competition comprises four tracks using a large-scale and in-the-wild dataset
of 59,299 vocalizations from 1,702 speakers. The first, the A-VB-High task,
requires competition participants to perform a multi-label regression on a
novel model for emotion, utilizing ten classes of richly annotated emotional
expression intensities, including; Awe, Fear, and Surprise. The second, the
A-VB-Two task, utilizes the more conventional 2-dimensional model for emotion,
arousal, and valence. The third, the A-VB-Culture task, requires participants
to explore the cultural aspects of the dataset, training native-country
dependent models. Finally, for the fourth task, A-VB-Type, participants should
recognize the type of vocal burst (e.g., laughter, cry, grunt) as an 8-class
classification. This paper describes the four tracks and baseline systems,
which use state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The baseline performance
for each track is obtained by utilizing an end-to-end deep learning model and
is as follows: for A-VB-High, a mean (over the 10-dimensions) Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.5687 CCC is obtained; for A-VB-Two, a mean
(over the 2-dimensions) CCC of 0.5084 is obtained; for A-VB-Culture, a mean CCC
from the four cultures of 0.4401 is obtained; and for A-VB-Type, the baseline
Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) from the 8-classes is 0.4172 UAR.

of possible states. When the states are mutually orthogonal, perfect state
discrimination is alway possible using a global measurement. In the case of
multipartite systems when the parties are constrained to use multiple rounds of
local operations and classical communications (LOCC), perfect state
discrimination is often impossible even with the use of \emph{asymptotic LOCC},
wherein an error is allowed but must vanish in the limit of an infinite number
of rounds. Utilizing our recent results on asymptotic LOCC, we derive a lower
bound on the error probability for LOCC discrimination of any given set of
mutually orthogonal pure states. We use this lower bound to prove necessary
conditions for perfect state discrimination by asymptotic LOCC. We then
illustrate by example the power of these necessary conditions in significantly
simplifying the determination of whether perfect discrimination of a given set
of states can be accomplished arbitrarily closely using LOCC. The latter
examples include a proof that perfect discrimination by asymptotic LOCC is
impossible for any \emph{minimal} unextendible product basis (UPB), where
minimal means that for the given multipartite system, no UPB with a smaller
number of states can exist. We also give a simple proof that what has been
called \emph{strong nonlocality without entanglement} is considerably stronger
than had previously been demonstrated.

the first theoretical justification of graph topology sampling in training (up

GCN training leads to a diminishing generalization error. Moreover, our method
tackles the nonconvex interaction of weights across layers, which is

a black box tool, and users should expect to fine-tune some settings for each

creates intermediate figures and outputs that allow users to compare
$\texttt{Eureka!}$'s performance using different parameter settings or to
compare $\texttt{Eureka!}$ with an independent pipeline. The ECF used to run
each stage is also copied into the output folder from each stage to enhance

predictions for weak lensing statistics are needed to limit the impact of
theoretical uncertainties on cosmological parameter constraints. For this
purpose, we present a comparison of the theoretical predictions for the
nonlinear matter and weak lensing power spectra, based on the widely used
fitting functions ($\texttt{mead}$ and $\texttt{rev-halofit}$), emulators
($\texttt{EuclidEmulator}$, $\texttt{EuclidEmulator2}$,
$\texttt{BaccoEmulator}$ and $\texttt{CosmicEmulator}$) and N-body simulations
($\texttt{Pkdgrav3}$). We consider the forecasted constraints on the $\Lambda
\texttt{CDM}$ and $\texttt{wCDM}$ models from weak lensing for stage III and
stage IV surveys. We study the relative bias on the constraints and their
dependence on the assumed prescriptions. Assuming a $\Lambda \texttt{CDM}$
cosmology, we find that the relative agreement on the $S_8$ parameter is
between $0.2-0.3\sigma$ for a stage III-like survey between the above
predictors. For a stage IV-like survey the agreement becomes $1.4-3.0\sigma$.
In the $\texttt{wCDM}$ scenario, we find broader $S_8$ constraints, and
agreements of $0.18-0.26\sigma$ and $0.7-1.7\sigma$ for stage III and stage IV
surveys, respectively. The accuracies of the above predictors therefore appear
adequate for stage III surveys, while the fitting functions would need
improvements for future stage IV weak lensing surveys. Furthermore, we find
that, of the fitting functions, $\texttt{mead}$ provides the best agreement
with the emulators. We discuss the implication of these findings for the
preparation of the future weak lensing surveys.

molecular similarity. Such descriptors are key for traversing chemical compound
space with machine learning. Our focus is on the Coulomb matrix and on the
smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP). We adopt a basic framework that
allows us to connect both descriptors to electronic structure theory. This
framework enables us then to define two new descriptors that are more closely
related to electronic structure theory, which we call Coulomb lists and smooth
overlap of electron densities (SOED). By investigating their usefulness as
molecular similarity descriptors, we gain new insights in how and why Coulomb
matrix and SOAP work. Moreover, Coulomb lists avoid the somewhat mysterious
diagonalization step of the Coulomb matrix and might provide a direct means to
extract subsystem information that can be compared across Born-Oppenheimer
surfaces of varying dimension. For the electron density we derive the necessary
formalism to create the SOED measure in close analogy to SOAP. Since this
formalism is more involved than that of SOAP, we review the essential theory,
but also introduce a set of approximations that eventually allow us to work
with SOED in terms of the same implementation available for the evaluation of
SOAP. We focus our analysis on elementary reaction steps, where transition
state structures are more similar to either reactant or product structures than
the latter two are with respect to one another. The prediction of electronic
energies of transition state structures can, however, be more difficult than
that of stable intermediates due to multi-configurational effects. The question
arises to what extent molecular similarity descriptors rooted in electronic
structure theory can resolve these intricate effects.

performance as compared with soft copper ones. The results of experiments
showed that welded, hard copper cavities have shown breakdown rate of
$10^{-3}$/pulse/meter at a gradient of about 150 MV/m, in the X-band, a using a
shaped pulse with a 150 ns flat part. We continue the design, construction, and
higher power experimental tests of three cells standing wave (SW) 11.424 GHz
accelerating cavities fabricated with hard CuAg alloy to study the RF breakdown
physics. Our aim is to fabricate the accelerating structures with innovative
technologies easier to handle and cheaper; easier for surfaces inspection;
easier for data elaboration and validation of joining techniques. The choice of
these new technological approaches and design methods provides also the
possibility of allocating the parasitic Higher Order Mode dampers. This paper
describes the design of an optimized cavity made with sectors which provides a
high longitudinal shunt impedance $R_{sh}$ of the operating mode. The cavity
will be fabricated by using the Tungsten Inert Gas process to realize a hard
CuAg structure. Two three-cells SW X-band accelerating cavities, to be operated
in the $\pi$-mode and made out of hard CuAg alloy, were already fabricated at
INFN-LNF by means of clamping and welding by using the TIG approach. Finally,
we also report the RF characterization and low-power RF tests of a two-halves
split hard CuAg structure that will be consequently TIG welded and employed for
high-gradient tests and for the study of the RF breakdown physics.

This work is motivated by such debate by using a complex systems framework in
which we study the form as an emergent property of rhythm. Such a framework
corresponds with the traditional notion of musical form and allows us to
generalize this concept to more general shapes and structures in music. We
develop the three following metrics of the rhythmic complexity of a musical
piece and its parts: 1) the rhythmic heterogeneity, based on the permutation
entropy, where high values indicate a wide variety of rhythmic patterns; 2) the
syncopation, based on the distribution of on-beat onsets, where high values
indicate a high proportion of off-the-beat notes; and 3) the component
extractor, based on the communities of a visibility graph of the rhythmic
figures over time, where we identify structural components that constitute the
piece at a (to be explained) perceptual level. With the same parameters, our
metrics are comparable within a piece or between pieces.

twisted string actuators (TSAs) to drive a soft robotic gripper. TSAs have been
used in numerous robotic applications, but their inclusion in soft robots has
been limited. The proposed design of the gripper was inspired by the human
hand. Tunable stiffness was implemented in the fingers with antagonistic TSAs.
The fingers' bending angles, actuation speed, blocked force output, and
stiffness tuning were experimentally characterized. The gripper achieved a
score of 6 on the Kapandji test and recreated 31 of the 33 grasps of the Feix

13 times its own weight. A comparison study revealed that the proposed gripper
exhibited equivalent or superior performance compared to other similar soft

transforms the observation space of each terminal into a scalable form
independent of the number of terminals. To compensate for the partial

infer behaviors of their hidden terminals from the carrier sensed channel

is proposed, whereby the terminals are instructed to maximize the system
throughput while balancing the terminals' transmission opportunities over the

optimize the process and reduce stopovers because it can provide constant
valuable information regarding the machine condition to the operators. However,
formalizing operational (tacit) knowledge to explicit knowledge is not an easy
task. This transformation considers modeling expert knowledge, quantification
of knowledge uncertainty, and validation of the acquired knowledge. This study
proposes a novel approach for production assessment using a knowledge transfer
framework and evidence theory to address the aforementioned challenges. The
main contribution of this paper is a methodology for the formalization of tacit
knowledge based on an extended failure mode and effect analysis for knowledge
extraction, as well as the use of evidence theory for the uncertainty
definition of knowledge. Moreover, this approach uses primitive recursive
functions for knowledge modeling and proposes a validation strategy of the
knowledge using machine data. These elements are integrated into an interactive
recommendation system hosted on a backend that uses HoloLens as a visual

bulk good system. The results yield interesting insights, including the
knowledge validation, uncertainty behavior of knowledge, and interactive

aerial vehicle (UAV) communications has focused on a fixed location for the IRS

will prohibit mobile users from maximizing many wireless network benefits, such
as data rate and coverage. Furthermore, assuming that the IRS is placed on a
UAV is impractical for various reasons, including the IRS's weight and size and
the speed of wind in severe weather. Unlike previous studies, this study
assumes a single UAV and an IRS mounted on a mobile ground vehicle (M-IRS) to
be deployed in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) 6G wireless network to maximize the
average data rate. Such a methodology for providing wireless coverage using an
M-IRS assisted UAV system is expected in smart cities. In this paper, we
formulate an optimization problem to find an efficient trajectory for the UAV,
an efficient path for the M-IRS, and users' power allocation coefficients that
maximize the average data rate for mobile ground users. Due to its
intractability, we propose efficient techniques that can help in finding the
solution to the optimization problem. First, we show that our dynamic power
allocation technique outperforms the fixed power allocation technique in terms
of network average sum rate. Then we employ the individual movement model
(Random Waypoint Model) in order to represent the users' movements inside the
coverage area. Finally, we propose an efficient approach using a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) for finding an efficient trajectory for the UAV, and an
efficient path for the M-IRS to provide wireless connectivity for mobile users
during their movement. We demonstrate through simulations that our methodology
can enhance the average data rate by 15\% on average compared with the static
IRS and by 25\% on average compared without the IRS system.

a natural way in the modeling of many practical problems, in particular, in
theoretical computer science.
  We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of closed
Euler dynamic $H$-trail in $H$-colored multigraphs. Also we provide polynomial

$L_2^H(G)$, in a closed dynamic H-trail in $G$, and vice versa, where

internet advertising as it allows advertisers to specify high-level goals, such
as maximizing value subject to a value-per-spend constraint. Prior research has
mostly focused on auctions which are truthful (such as SPA) since uniform
bidding is optimal in such auctions, which makes it manageable to reason about
equilibria. A tantalizing question is whether one can obtain more efficient
outcomes by leaving the realm of truthful auctions.
  This is the first paper to study non-truthful auctions in the prior-free
auto-bidding setting. Our first result is that non-truthfulness provides no
benefit when one considers deterministic auctions. Any deterministic mechanism
has a price of anarchy (PoA) of at least $2$, even for $2$ bidders; this
matches what can be achieved by deterministic truthful mechanisms. In
particular, we prove that the first price auction has PoA of exactly $2$. For
our second result, we construct a randomized non-truthful auction that achieves
a PoA of $1.8$ for $2$ bidders. This is the best-known PoA for this problem.
The previously best-known PoA for this problem was $1.9$ and was achieved with
a truthful mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefit of non-truthfulness
in this setting by showing that the truthful version of this randomized auction
also has a PoA of $1.9$. Finally, we show that no auction (even randomized,
non-truthful) can improve upon a PoA bound of $2$ as the number of advertisers
grow to infinity.

motivated by a suggestion that ""superconducting diode effect"" may be an
intrinsic property of non-centrosymmetric superconductors with strong
spin-orbit interactions[1]. Theoretically it has been understood that linear in
the Cooper pair momentum terms, caused by the Rashba spin-orbit and Zeeman
interactions or, more generally, any symmetry-allowed Lifshitz invariants[2] in
uniform singlet superconductors, do not contribute to the supercurrent,

show that critical current non-reciprocity is a generic property of
multilayered superconductor structures in the presence of magnetic
field-generated diamagnetic currents. In the regime of an intermediate coupling
between the layers, the Josephson vortices are predicted to form at high fields
and currents. We report the observation of NRC in nanowires fabricated from
InAs/Al heterostructures. The effect is independent of the crystallographic
orientation of the wire, ruling out an intrinsic origin of NRC. Non-monotonic
NRC evolution with magnetic field is consistent with the generation of
diamagnetic currents and formation of the Josephson vortices. This extrinsic
NRC mechanism can be used to design novel devices for superconducting circuits.

The reward distributions are conditioned on the arm and unknown latent states.
The goal is to use the reward history to identify the latent state, allowing
for the optimal choice of arms in the future. The latent bandit setting lends
itself to many practical applications, such as recommender and decision support
systems, where rich data allows the offline estimation of environment models
with online learning remaining a critical component. Previous solutions in this
setting always choose the highest reward arm according to the agent's beliefs
about the state, not explicitly considering the value of information-gathering
arms. Such information-gathering arms do not necessarily provide the highest
reward, thus may never be chosen by an agent that chooses the highest reward
arms at all times.
  In this paper, we present a method for information-gathering in latent
bandits. Given particular reward structures and transition matrices, we show
that choosing the best arm given the agent's beliefs about the states incurs
higher regret. Furthermore, we show that by choosing arms carefully, we obtain
an improved estimation of the state distribution, and thus lower the cumulative
regret through better arm choices in the future. We evaluate our method on both
synthetic and real-world data sets, showing significant improvement in regret

  Algorithm",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The tree pruning process is the key to promoting fruits' growth and improving
their productions due to effects on the photosynthesis efficiency of fruits and
nutrition transportation in branches. Currently, pruning is still highly
dependent on human labor. The workers' experience will strongly affect the
robustness of the performance of the tree pruning. Thus, it is a challenge for
workers and farmers to evaluate the pruning performance. Intended for a better
solution to the problem, this paper presents a novel pruning classification
strategy model called ""OTSU-SVM"" to evaluate the pruning performance based on
the shadows of branches and leaves. This model considers not only the available
illuminated area of the tree but also the uniformity of the illuminated area of
the tree. More importantly, our group implements OTSU algorithm into the model,
which highly reinforces robustness of the evaluation of this model. In
addition, the data from the pear trees in the Yuhang District, Hangzhou is also
used in the experiment. In this experiment, we prove that the OTSU-SVM has good
accuracy with 80% and high performance in the evaluation of the pruning for the
pear trees. It can provide more successful pruning if applied into the orchard.
A successful pruning can broaden the illuminated area of individual fruit, and
increase nutrition transportation from the target branch, dramatically
elevating the weights and production of the fruits.

  Performance Analysis and Beamforming Optimization",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Delay alignment modulation (DAM) has been recently proposed to enable
manipulable channel delay spread for efficient single- or multi-carrier
communications. In particular, with perfect delay alignment, inter-symbol
interference (ISI) can be eliminated even with single-carrier (SC)
transmission, without relying on sophisticated channel equalization. The key
ideas of DAM are delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming, so that all
multi-path signal components may arrive at the receiver simultaneously and be
superimposed constructively, rather than causing the detrimental ISI. Compared
to the classic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission,
DAM-enabled SC communication has several appealing advantages, including low
peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) and high tolerance for Doppler frequency
shift, which renders DAM also appealing for radar sensing. Therefore, in this
paper, DAM is investigated for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
systems. We first study the output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for ISI-free
SC communication and radar sensing, and then derive the closed-form expressions
for DAM-based sensing in terms of the ambiguity function (AF) and integrated
sidelobe ratio (ISR). Furthermore, we study the beamforming design problem for
DAM-based ISAC to maximize the communication SNR while guaranteeing the sensing
performance in terms of the sensing SNR and ISR. Finally, we provide
performance comparison between DAM and OFDM for ISAC, and it is revealed that
DAM signal may achieve better communication and sensing performance, thanks to
its low PAPR, reduced guard interval overhead, as well as higher tolerance for
Doppler frequency shift. Simulation results are provided to show the great
potential of DAM for ISAC.

saliency map, and even locate features that are irrelevant to decisions. In
this paper, we propose an Absolute value Class Activation Mapping-based
(Abs-CAM) method, which optimizes the gradients derived from the
backpropagation and turns all of them into positive gradients to enhance the
visual features of output neurons' activation, and improve the localization
ability of the saliency map. The framework of Abs-CAM is divided into two
phases: generating initial saliency map and generating final saliency map. The
first phase improves the localization ability of the saliency map by optimizing
the gradient, and the second phase linearly combines the initial saliency map
with the original image to enhance the semantic information of the saliency
map. We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method,
including Deletion, Insertion, and Pointing Game. The experimental results show
that the Abs-CAM can obviously eliminate the noise in the saliency map, and can
better locate the features related to decisions, and is superior to the

Under pulsed laser irradiation, the absorption behaviors of the TiAlN-TiN

learning. However, AUC maximization algorithms may decrease generalization
performance due to the noisy data. Self-paced learning is an effective method

limited to pointwise learning, while AUC maximization is a pairwise learning
problem. To solve this challenging problem, we innovatively propose a balanced
self-paced AUC maximization algorithm (BSPAUC). Specifically, we first provide
a statistical objective for self-paced AUC. Based on this, we propose our
self-paced AUC maximization formulation, where a novel balanced self-paced
regularization term is embedded to ensure that the selected positive and
negative samples have proper proportions. Specially, the sub-problem with
respect to all weight variables may be non-convex in our formulation, while the
one is normally convex in existing self-paced problems. To address this, we
propose a doubly cyclic block coordinate descent method. More importantly, we
prove that the sub-problem with respect to all weight variables converges to a
stationary point on the basis of closed-form solutions, and our BSPAUC
converges to a stationary point of our fixed optimization objective under a
mild assumption. Considering both the deep learning and kernel-based

high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of isothermal and inviscid gas flow
around a planet to investigate planetary-mass dependence of gas accretion band
width and gas accretion rate onto circumplanetary disks. We examined cases with
various planetary masses corresponding to M_p=0.05-1M_{Jup} at 5.2 au, where
M_{Jup} is the current Jovian mass. We found that the radial width of the gas
accretion band is proportional to M_p^{1/6} for the low-mass regime with M_p <
0.2 M_{Jup} while it is proportional to M_p for the high-mass regime with M_p >
0.2M_{Jup}. We found that the ratio of the mass accretion rate onto the

externally oscillations, shape-changes, and internal oscillations. We find that
large-amplitude changes of the particle's shape using the shape-change

the aspect ratio (l/w), improving the tensile strength of the collective. We
demonstrate application of these simulations in two experimental systems:
robotic chains and entangled worm blobs. In the robophysical models, we find

and minimizing the event space of an action model under certain structural
relationships. The Kripke model equivalence is perfectly caught by the
structural relationship called bisimulation. In this paper, we propose the
generalized action emulation perfectly catching the action model equivalence.
Previous structural relationships sufficient for the action model equivalence,
i.e. the bisimulation, the propositional action emulation, the action
emulation, and the action emulation of canonical action models, can be
described by various restricted versions of the generalized action emulation.
We summarize four critical properties of the atom set over preconditions, and
prove that any formula set satisfying these properties can be used to restrict
the generalized action emulation to determine the action model equivalence by
an iteration algorithm. We also construct a new formula set with these four
properties, which is generally more efficient than the atom set. The technique
of the partition refinement has been used to minimize the world space of a
Kripke model under the bisimulation. Applying the partition refinement to
action models allows one to minimize their event spaces under the bisimulation.
The propositional action emulation is weaker than bismulation but still
sufficient for the action model equivalence. We prove that it is
PSPACE-complete to minimize the event space of an action model under the
propositional action emulation, and provide a PSPACE algorithm for it. Finally,
we prove that minimize the event space under the action model equivalence is
PSPACE-hard, and propose a computable method based on the canonical formulas of
modal logics to solve this problem.

one-dimensional (1D) bichromatic silicon carbide nanoparticle (NP) chains, and
demonstrate that they can considerably enhance radiative heat transfer for an
array much longer than the wavelength of radiation. By introducing
incommensurate or commensurate modulations on the interparticle distances, the
NP chain can be regarded as an extension of the off-diagonal
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model. By calculating the eigenstate spectra with
respect to the modulation phase that creates a synthetic dimension, we
demonstrate that under this type of modulation the chain supports nontrivial
topological modes localized over the boundaries, since the present system
inherits the topological property of two-dimensional integer quantum Hall
systems. In this circumstance the gap-labeling theorem and corresponding Chern
number can be used to characterize the features of band gaps and topological
edge modes. Based on many-body radiative heat transfer theory for a set of
dipoles, we theoretically show the presence of topological gaps and midgap
TPhPs can substantially enhance radiative heat transfer for an array much

acts as the synthetic dimension can tailor the radiative heat transfer rate by
inducing or annihilating topological modes. We also discuss the role of

searching for efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) from a given supernet. In
parallel, the lottery ticket hypothesis has shown that DNNs contain small
subnetworks that can be trained from scratch to achieve a comparable or higher
accuracy than original DNNs. As such, it is currently a common practice to
develop efficient DNNs via a pipeline of first search and then prune.
Nevertheless, doing so often requires a search-train-prune-retrain process and
thus prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we discover for the first
time that both efficient DNNs and their lottery subnetworks (i.e., lottery
tickets) can be directly identified from a supernet, which we term as
SuperTickets, via a two-in-one training scheme with jointly architecture
searching and parameter pruning. Moreover, we develop a progressive and unified
SuperTickets identification strategy that allows the connectivity of
subnetworks to change during supernet training, achieving better accuracy and
efficiency trade-offs than conventional sparse training. Finally, we evaluate
whether such identified SuperTickets drawn from one task can transfer well to
other tasks, validating their potential of handling multiple tasks
simultaneously. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three tasks and
four benchmark datasets validate that our proposed SuperTickets achieve boosted
accuracy and efficiency trade-offs than both typical NAS and pruning pipelines,

networks (Agg-GNNs) considering perturbations of the underlying graph. An
Agg-GNN is a hybrid architecture where information is defined on the nodes of a
graph, but it is processed block-wise by Euclidean CNNs on the nodes after
several diffusions on the graph shift operator. We derive stability bounds for
the mapping operator associated to a generic Agg-GNN, and we specify conditions
under which such operators can be stable to deformations. We prove that the
stability bounds are defined by the properties of the filters in the first
layer of the CNN that acts on each node. Additionally, we show that there is a
close relationship between the number of aggregations, the filter's
selectivity, and the size of the stability constants. We also conclude that in
Agg-GNNs the selectivity of the mapping operators is tied to the properties of
the filters only in the first layer of the CNN stage. This shows a substantial
difference with respect to the stability properties of selection GNNs, where
the selectivity of the filters in all layers is constrained by their stability.
We provide numerical evidence corroborating the results derived, testing the
behavior of Agg-GNNs in real life application scenarios considering
perturbations of different magnitude.

have achieved good performance in several medical imaging tasks. However, these
methods focus only on global distribution adaptation and ignore distribution
constraints at the category level, which would lead to sub-optimal adaptation
performance. This paper presents an unsupervised domain adaptation framework
based on category-level regularization that regularizes the category
distribution from three perspectives. Specifically, for inter-domain category
regularization, an adaptive prototype alignment module is proposed to align
feature prototypes of the same category in the source and target domains. In
addition, for intra-domain category regularization, we tailored a
regularization technique for the source and target domains, respectively. In
the source domain, a prototype-guided discriminative loss is proposed to learn
more discriminative feature representations by enforcing intra-class
compactness and inter-class separability, and as a complement to traditional
supervised loss. In the target domain, an augmented consistency category
regularization loss is proposed to force the model to produce consistent
predictions for augmented/unaugmented target images, which encourages
semantically similar regions to be given the same label. Extensive experiments
on two publicly fundus datasets show that the proposed approach significantly

vulnerabilities and some of the most worrying are the adversarial inputs, which

Furthermore, for an energy efficient testing and retraining, data scientists
need support on which are the best guidance metrics and optimal dataset
configurations.
  Aims: We examined four guidance metrics for retraining convolutional neural
networks and three retraining configurations. Our goal is to improve the models
against adversarial inputs regarding accuracy, resource utilization and time
from the point of view of a data scientist in the context of image
classification.
  Method: We conducted an empirical study in two datasets for image
classification. We explore: (a) the accuracy, resource utilization and time of
retraining convolutional neural networks by ordering new training set by four
different guidance metrics (neuron coverage, likelihood-based surprise
adequacy, distance-based surprise adequacy and random), (b) the accuracy and
resource utilization of retraining convolutional neural networks with three
different configurations (from scratch and augmented dataset, using weights and
augmented dataset, and using weights and only adversarial inputs).
  Results: We reveal that retraining with adversarial inputs from original
weights and by ordering with surprise adequacy metrics gives the best model

  Conclusions: Although more studies are necessary, we recommend data
scientists to use the above configuration and metrics to deal with the

improve their models against adversarial inputs without using many inputs.

we modify the equation of the area and volume operator. In the quantum
geometry, for \(SO(3)\) group, the angular momentum operators \(J^{k}\) is the

Therefore, new perspective of quantum spin can be directly applicable to

increases with \(n^{2}\) in discrete way that suggests discrete spectrum of the
area operator similar to the actual formula of the area operator. This

  Robots and Systems (IROS 2022)",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To accomplish task efficiently in a multiple robots system, a problem that
has to be addressed is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). LiDAR
(Light Detection and Ranging) has been used for many SLAM solutions due to its
superb accuracy, but its performance degrades in featureless environments, like
tunnels or long corridors. Centralized SLAM solves the problem with a cloud
server, which requires a huge amount of computational resources and lacks
robustness against central node failure. To address these issues, we present a
distributed SLAM solution to estimate the trajectory of a group of robots using
Ultra-WideBand (UWB) ranging and odometry measurements. The proposed approach
distributes the processing among the robot team and significantly mitigates the
computation concern emerged from the centralized SLAM. Our solution determines
the relative pose (also known as loop closure) between two robots by minimizing
the UWB ranging measurements taken at different positions when the robots are
in close proximity. UWB provides a good distance measure in line-of-sight
conditions, but retrieving a precise pose estimation remains a challenge, due
to ranging noise and unpredictable path traveled by the robot. To deal with the
suspicious loop closures, we use Pairwise Consistency Maximization (PCM) to
examine the quality of loop closures and perform outlier rejections. The
filtered loop closures are then fused with odometry in a distributed pose graph
optimization (DPGO) module to recover the full trajectory of the robot team.
Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

algorithms usually out-perform their single-modality counterparts in robotics.
Camera and LIDAR, with complementary semantic and depth information, are the
typical choices for detection tasks in complicated driving environments. For
most camera-LIDAR fusion algorithms, however, the calibration of the sensor
suite will greatly impact the performance. More specifically, the detection
algorithm usually requires an accurate geometric relationship among multiple
sensors as the input, and it is often assumed that the contents from these
sensors are captured at the same time. Preparing such sensor suites involves
carefully designed calibration rigs and accurate synchronization mechanisms,
and the preparation process is usually done offline. In this work, a
segmentation-based framework is proposed to jointly estimate the geometrical
and temporal parameters in the calibration of a camera-LIDAR suite. A semantic
segmentation mask is first applied to both sensor modalities, and the
calibration parameters are optimized through pixel-wise bidirectional loss. We
specifically incorporated the velocity information from optical flow for
temporal parameters. Since supervision is only performed at the segmentation
level, no calibration label is needed within the framework. The proposed
algorithm is tested on the KITTI dataset, and the result shows an accurate
real-time calibration of both geometric and temporal parameters.

first fabricates a 3D object with multi-material active composites and apply
external loads in the programming stage. Then, a change in an environmental
stimulus and the removal of loads cause the object deform in the programmed
stage. The dynamic transition between the original and deformed shapes is
achieved with appropriate applications of the stimulus. The mathematical
interest is to find an optimal distribution for the materials such that the 3D

best as possible.
  Casting the problem as a PDE-constrained minimisation problem, we consider a
vector-valued order parameter representing the volume fractions of the
different materials in the composite as a control variable. We prove the
existence of optimal designs and formulate first order necessary conditions for
minimisers. Moreover, by suitable asymptotic techniques, we relate our approach
to a sharp interface description. Finally, the theoretical results are

compares the auto- and cross-correlation function multipoles of these

improved when combining these two sources of information in comparison to
fitting to either peculiar velocity or clustering information separately. When
combining velocity and density statistics in the range $27 < s < 123 \, h^{-1}$

Current path planning methods for such scenarios consider the aircraft pose,

presents a framework for incorporating uncertainty in these quantities into a
radar detection model that is used by a path planner. The developed path
planner evaluates the radar detection risk in the presence of uncertainties and
uses linear covariance analysis to efficiently generate error budgets. The
error budgets identify the contribution of each source of uncertainty (e.g.,
sensor measurement noise, radar position uncertainty) to the overall
variability in the probability of detection. The framework is applied to a
modified visibility graph path planner that uses the detection risk and its
variability to calculate path adjustments, which maintain the detection risk
below a specified threshold. The results show that the framework is effective
at providing actionable information to the mission planner that improves the

first few layers for short data and more layers for long data. Furthermore, to
address the second problem, we introduce Temporal Encoding, which embeds the

improve classification accuracy especially on short data obtained as partial

video quality assessment (VQA) has become a challenging and demanding problem.
Although lots of efforts have been made to solve this problem, it remains
unclear how the human visual system (HVS) relates to the temporal quality of
videos. Meanwhile, recent work has found that the frames of natural video
transformed into the perceptual domain of the HVS tend to form a straight
trajectory of the representations. With the obtained insight that distortion
impairs the perceived video quality and results in a curved trajectory of the
perceptual representation, we propose a temporal perceptual quality index
(TPQI) to measure the temporal distortion by describing the graphic morphology
of the representation. Specifically, we first extract the video perceptual
representations from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual
area (V1) of the HVS, and then measure the straightness and compactness of
their trajectories to quantify the degradation in naturalness and content
continuity of video. Experiments show that the perceptual representation in the
HVS is an effective way of predicting subjective temporal quality, and thus
TPQI can, for the first time, achieve comparable performance to the spatial
quality metric and be even more effective in assessing videos with large
temporal variations. We further demonstrate that by combining with NIQE, a
spatial quality metric, TPQI can achieve top performance over popular
in-the-wild video datasets. More importantly, TPQI does not require any
additional information beyond the video being evaluated and thus can be applied
to any datasets without parameter tuning. Source code is available at

both issues, proposing a new predictivity criterion that carefully weights the

incremental experimental design methods to ""optimally"" select the test points

studied, including greedy-packing (coffee-house design), support points and

To this end, we formulate scene graph expansion as a sequential prediction task

clustering patterns amongst nodes. In addition, we leverage external knowledge

comprehensively evaluate different aspects of predicted relations. We conduct
extensive experiments on Visual Genome and VRD datasets to evaluate the

report on the image-charge detection of the Rydberg transition in a
many-electron system confined in an array of 20-um wide and 4-um deep channels

significant enhancement of the image-charge signal due to close proximity of

ancillary information about the noise (e.g., stellar activity indicators) and
specific data- or context-driven data (e.g., instrumental measurements,
simulations of stellar variability) . The detection part of the procedure uses
a detection test that is applied to a standardized periodogram. Standardization
allows an autocalibration of the noise sources with partially unknown
statistics. The estimation of the p-value of the test output is based on
dedicated Monte Carlo simulations that allow handling unknown parameters. The
procedure is versatile in the sense that the specific pair (periodogram and
test) is chosen by the user. We demonstrate by extensive numerical experiments
on synthetic and real RV data from the Sun and aCenB that the proposed method
reliably allows estimating the p-values. The method also provides a way to
evaluate the dependence of the estimated p-values that are attributed to a
reported detection on modeling errors. It is a critical point for RV planet
detection at low signal-to-noise ratio to evaluate this dependence. The python
algorithms are available on GitHub. Accurate estimation of p-values when
unknown parameters are involved is an important but only recently addressed
question in the field of RV detection. Although this work presents a method to
do this, the statistical literature discussed in this paper may trigger the
development of other strategies.

reaction and nuclear astrophysics. Experimental spectrum data for the 101Sn

region. Since there is not enough experimental data in the literature,
different approaches are used for the obtaining spes for the region such as
using the hole excitation spectrum in 131Sn or using the lightest and closest
isotope 107Sn which figures the model space orbitals. In this work, we have
performed second order polynomial fits of the tree single-particle states s1/2,
d3/2 and h11/2 in the light Sn isotopes up to 113Sn and 115Sn which are not
determined yet experimentally. By an extrapolation toward light Sn isotopes, we
can obtain the excitation energies of all the single-particle states in 101Sn.
Subsequently, neutron spes of the model space orbitals are defined. Shell model
calculations for even and odd 102-107Sn isotopes are carried out using the new
interactions and the results are compared with the experimental data and
results obtained using the widely used interaction sn100pn.

planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic
disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of
different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the
range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these reactions has a specific
midpoint redox potential accessible thanks to specialised proteins called
oxidoreductases, that constitute life's engines. These proteins have one or
more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These
metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into
the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of
these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of
the distribution (in time and space) of the supernovae explosions and complex
galaxy dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access
thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in
identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least

neighbours, which indicates the signal of coherence between the rotation of the
SAMI galaxies and the motion of neighbours, is 9.0 $\pm$ 5.4 km s$^{-1}$ (1.7
$\sigma$) for neighbours within 1 Mpc. In a large-scale analysis, we find that
the average velocity offsets increase for neighbours out to 2 Mpc. However, the
velocities are consistent with zero or negative for neighbours outside 3 Mpc.
The negative signals for neighbours at distance around 10 Mpc are also
significant at $\sim 2$ $\sigma$ level, which indicate that the positive
signals within 2 Mpc might come from the variance of large-scale structure. We
also calculate average velocities of different subsamples, including galaxies
in different regions of the sky, galaxies with different stellar masses, galaxy
type, $\lambda_{Re}$ and inclination. Although low-mass, high-mass, early-type
and low-spin galaxies subsamples show 2 - 3 $\sigma$ signal of coherence for
the neighbours within 2 Mpc, the results for different inclination subsamples
and large-scale results suggest that the $\sim 2 \sigma$ signals might result
from coincidental scatter or variance of large-scale structure. Overall, the
modest evidence of coherence signals for neighbouring galaxies within 2 Mpc
needs to be confirmed by larger samples of observations and simulation studies.

interplay between this global chirality and additional degrees of freedom, such
as magnetic ordering and the local octahedral chirality arising from the
geometry of the bonds, can yield striking phenomena. In this work, we focus on
collinear antiferromagnetic CrI$_3$ twisted homo-bilayers, which are

symmetry analysis, density functional theory and tight-binding model
calculations we show that layers twisting can lower the structural and magnetic
point-group symmetries, thus activating pyroelectricity and the magneto-optical
Kerr effect, which would otherwise be absent in untwisted antiferromagnetic
homo-bilayers. Interestingly, both electric polarization and Kerr angle are
controllable by the twist angle and their sign is reversed when switching from
left- to right-twisted bilayers. We further unveil the occurrence of
unconventional vortices with spin textures that alternate opposite chiralities
in momentum space. These findings demonstrate that the interplay between
twisting and octahedral chirality in magnetic bilayers and related van der

three-dimensional (2D/3D) materials comprised of weakly coupled correlated 1D

quantitative and unbiased study of USC and high-$T_c$ superconductivity - and
potentially many more correlated phases - in fermionic Q1D systems from
microscopic parameters, in ways inaccessible to previous methods. It opens the
possibility of designing deliberately optimized Q1D superconductors, from

the position of the wheels or axles during the passage of a vehicle is in most

bridge type specific methods, we propose a novel method for axle detection
through the placement of accelerometers at any point of a bridge. In order to
develop a model that is as simple and comprehensible as possible, the axle
detection task is implemented as a binary classification problem instead of a
regression problem. The model is implemented as a Fully Convolutional Network
to process signals in the form of Continuous Wavelet Transforms. This allows
passages of any length to be processed in a single step with maximum efficiency
while utilising multiple scales in a single evaluation. This enables our method
to use acceleration signals at any location of the bridge structure serving as
Virtual Axle Detectors (VADs) without being limited to specific structural
types of bridges. To test the proposed method, we analysed 3787 train passages
recorded on a steel trough railway bridge of a long-distance traffic line. Our
results on the measurement data show that our model detects 95% of the axes,
thus, 128,599 of 134,800 previously unseen axles were correctly detected. In
total, 90% of the axles can be detected with a maximum spatial error of 20cm,
with a maximum velocity of $v_{\mathrm{max}}=56,3~\mathrm{m/s}$. The analysis
shows that our developed model can use accelerometers as VADs even under real
operating conditions.

associated with the rotational motions of compressible three-dimensional
turbulence. This question is examined through the lens of circulicity, a
concept related to the angular momentum carried by large turbulent scales. By
deriving a Monin-Yaglom relation for circulicity, we show that an ``effective''
cascade of this quantity exists, provided the flow is stirred with a force
having a solenoidal component. This outcome is obtained independently from the
expression of the equation of state. To supplement these results, a
coarse-graining analysis of the flow is performed. This approach allows to
separate the contributions of the transfer and production terms of circulicity
and to discuss their respective effects in the inertial range.

electrodes has been revealed by single-particle measurements, which indicates a
huge potential for developing high-power batteries. However, the
charging/discharging behaviors of single particles at ultrahigh C-rates can no
longer be described by the traditional electrochemical kinetics in such
ion-intercalation active materials. In the meantime, regular kinetic measuring
methods meet a challenge due to the coupling of interface reaction and
solid-state diffusion processes of active particles. Here, we decouple the
reaction and diffusion kinetics via time-resolved potential measurements with
an interval of 1 ms, revealing that the classical Butler-Volmer equation
deviates from the actual relation between current density, overpotential, and
Li+ concentration. An interface ion-intercalation model is developed which
considers the excess driving force of Li+ (de)intercalation in the charge
transfer reaction for ion-intercalation materials. Simulations demonstrate that
the proposed model enables accurate prediction of charging/discharging at both
single-particle and electrode scales for various active materials. The kinetic
limitation processes from single particles to composite electrodes are
systematically revealed, promoting rational designs of high-power batteries.

  Precoding Design",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Using precoding to suppress multi-user interference is a well-known technique
to improve spectra efficiency in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems, and the pursuit of high performance and low complexity
precoding method has been the focus in the last decade. The traditional
algorithms including the zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm and the weighted minimum
mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm failed to achieve a satisfactory trade-off
between complexity and performance. In this paper, leveraging on the power of
deep learning, we propose a low-complexity precoding design framework for
MU-MIMO systems. The key idea is to transform the MIMO precoding problem into
the multiple-input single-output precoding problem, where the optimal precoding
structure can be obtained in closed-form. A customized deep neural network is
designed to fit the mapping from the channels to the precoding matrix. In
addition, the technique of input dimensionality reduction, network pruning, and
recovery module compression are used to further improve the computational
efficiency. Furthermore, the extension to the practical MIMO orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system is studied. Simulation
results show that the proposed low-complexity precoding scheme achieves similar
performance as the WMMSE algorithm with very low computational complexity.

for a macroblock, followed by a refinement step that pays attention to the
correlations between the macroblock and its surroundings. At the decoder, the
refinement step can be performed in the same manner, thus no additional side
information has to be transmitted. Implementation of the spatial refinement
step into the H.264/AVC video codec leads to reduction in data rate of up to
nearly 15% and increase in PSNR of up to 0.75 dB, compared to pure motion

(RSOC) on electron transmission through a single-channel Nanowire (NW) in the
quantum coherent regime. We show that, while for a finite length NW with
homogeneous RSOC contacted to two electrodes the sign of its RSOC does not
affect electron transport, the situation can be quite different in the presence
of an inhomogeneous RSOC and a magnetic field applied along the NW axis. By
analyzing transport across an interface between two regions of different RSOC
we find that, if the two regions have equal RSOC signs, the transmission within
the magnetic gap energy range is almost perfect, regardless of the ratio of the
spin-orbit energies to the Zeeman energy. In contrast, when the two regions
have opposite RSOC signs and are Rashba-dominated, the transmission gets
suppressed. Furthermore, we discuss the implementation on a realistic NW setup
where two RSOC regions are realized with suitably coupled gates separated by a
finite distance. We find that the low-temperature NW conductance exhibits a
crossover from a short distance behavior that strongly depends on the relative
RSOC sign of the two regions to a large distance oscillatory behavior that is
independent of such relative sign. We are thus able to identify the conditions
where the NW conductance mainly depends on the sign of the RSOC and the ones
where only the RSOC magnitude matters.

is introduced as a novel spatiotemporal error concealment algorithm. The
algorithm operates in two steps. First, temporal error concealment is used for
obtaining an initial estimate. Afterwards, a spatial denoising algorithm is
used for reducing the imperfectness of the temporal extrapolation. For this,
Non-Local Means denoising is used which is extended by a spiral scan processing
order and is improved by an adaptation step for taking the preliminary temporal
extrapolation into account. In doing so, a spatio-temporal error concealment
results. By making use of the refinement, a visually noticeable average gain of
1 dB over pure temporal error concealment is possible. With this, the algorithm
also is able to clearly outperform other spatio-temporal error concealment
algorithms.

only related to the real/fake labels of facial images. However, we observe that
the features learned by vanilla classification networks are correlated to
unnecessary properties, such as forgery methods and facial identities. Such
phenomenon would limit forgery detection performance especially for the
generalization ability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method which
utilizes adversarial learning to eliminate the negative effect of different
forgery methods and facial identities, which helps classification network to
learn intrinsic common discriminative features for face forgery detection. To
leverage data lacking ground truth label of facial identities, we design a
special identity discriminator based on similarity information derived from
off-the-shelf face recognition model. With the help of adversarial learning,
our face forgery detection model learns to extract common discriminative
features through eliminating the effect of forgery methods and facial
identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method under both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluation settings.

pretrained BERT and GPT-2 language models as encoder and decoder, respectively,
to infer networks of symbols (schemata) from natural language datasets. Our

post-mass-transfer systems (BSSs, white dwarfs and blue lurkers) present in the
open clusters and how they are formed. First, we identified the cluster members
using Gaia EDR3 data in six open clusters. Two of the clusters, M67 and King2,
were studied in detail using UVIT, Gaia, GALEX, 2MASS and other archival
photometric data. The comprehensive panchromatic study showed that (i) there is
a robust mass-transfer pathway for BSSs, and blue lurkers in M67, (ii) at least
15% of BSSs in King 2 were formed via binary mass transfer. We also created a
homogeneous catalogue of open cluster BSSs using Gaia DR2 data. The analysis of
868 BSSs across 208 clusters showed that (i) BSS frequency increases with age,
(ii) there is a power-law relation between cluster mass and maximum number of
BSSs, (iii) the formation mechanism of BSSs is dominated by binary mass
transfer (54-67%) though there exists a 10-16% chance of BSSs forming through
more than 2 stellar interactions. This study demonstrates that there exists an
extensive variety in the demographics of binary products, and the UV
observations are vital for their detection and characterisation.

embedding images close to their class representatives (proxies), commonly with
respect to the angle between them. However, this disregards the embedding norm,
which can carry additional beneficial context such as class- or image-intrinsic
uncertainty. In addition, proxy-based DML struggles to learn class-internal
structures. To address both issues at once, we introduce non-isotropic
probabilistic proxy-based DML. We model images as directional von Mises-Fisher
(vMF) distributions on the hypersphere that can reflect image-intrinsic
uncertainties. Further, we derive non-isotropic von Mises-Fisher (nivMF)
distributions for class proxies to better represent complex class-specific
variances. To measure the proxy-to-image distance between these models, we
develop and investigate multiple distribution-to-point and
distribution-to-distribution metrics. Each framework choice is motivated by a
set of ablational studies, which showcase beneficial properties of our
probabilistic approach to proxy-based DML, such as uncertainty-awareness,
better-behaved gradients during training, and overall improved generalization
performance. The latter is especially reflected in the competitive performance
on the standard DML benchmarks, where our approach compares favorably,

test, we use the 3-year photometric SN Ia sample of the SuperNova Legacy Survey
(SNLS), made of 437 objects between 0.1 and 1.05 in redshift. We combine this
sample with non-SNLS objects of the JLA spectroscopic sample, made of 501
objects mostly below 0.4 in redshift. We study two options for the origin of
the redshifts of the photometric sample, either provided entirely from the host
photometric redshift catalogue or a mixed origin where 75% of the sample can be
assigned spectroscopic redshifts. Using light curve simulations subject to the
same photometric selection as data, we study the impact of photometric redshift
uncertainties and contamination on flat $\Lambda CDM$ fits to Hubble diagrams
from such combined samples. We find that photometric redshifts and
contamination lead to biased cosmological parameters. The magnitude of the bias
is similar for both redshift options. This bias can be largely accounted for if
photometric redshift uncertainties and contamination are taken into account
when computing the SN magnitude bias correction due to selection effects. To
reduce the cosmological bias further, we explore two methods to propagate
redshift uncertainties into the cosmological likelihood computation, either by
refitting photometric redshifts with cosmology or by sampling the redshift
resolution function. Redshift refitting fails at correcting the cosmological
bias whatever the redshift option, while sampling slightly reduces it in both
cases. For actual data, we find compatible results with the JLA ones for mixed
photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, while the full photometric option is

been shown to follow a binomial distribution, in which all cumulants inherit
the universal power-law scaling with the quench rate, with cumulant rations

prominent in the limit of slow quenches, leading to the breaking of power-law

utilize atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate key
structural-functional parameters of these targeting ligands for an effective

cRGD ligands is conjugated to PEG chains grafted to highly curved TiO$_2$
nanoparticles to unveil the impact of cRGD density on the ligand's

We find that a low density leads to an optimal spatial presentation of cRGD
ligands out of the ""stealth"" PEGylated layer around the nanosystem, favoring a
straight upward orientation and spaced distribution of the targeting ligands in
the bulk-water phase. On the contrary, high densities favor clustering and
internalization of cRGD ligands in the inner region of the PEGylated layer,
driven by a concerted mechanism of enhanced ligand-ligand interactions and
reduced water accessibility over the ligand's molecular surface. These findings
strongly suggest that the ligand density modulation is a key factor in the
design of cRGD-targeting nanodevices to maximize their binding efficiency into
over-expressed $\alpha_V\beta_3$ integrin receptors.

design but instead the outcome of the interaction of local agents who are
selfishly optimizing for their individual utility. The famous Network Creation
Game [Fabrikant et al., PODC 2003] enables us to understand such processes,
their dynamics, and their outcomes in the form of equilibrium states. In this
model, agents buy incident edges towards other agents for a price of $\alpha$
and simultaneously try to minimize their buying cost and their total hop
distance. Since in many real-world networks, e.g., social networks, consent
from both sides is required to maintain a connection, Corbo and Parkes [PODC
2005] proposed a bilateral version of the Network Creation Game, in which
mutual consent and payment are required in order to create edges. It is known
that the bilateral version has a significantly higher Price of Anarchy,
compared to the unilateral version. This is counter-intuitive, since
cooperation should help to avoid socially bad states. We investigate this
phenomenon by analyzing the Price of Anarchy of the bilateral version with
respect to different solution concepts that allow for various degrees of
cooperation among the agents. With this, we provide insights into what kind of
cooperation is needed to ensure that socially good networks are created. We
present a collection of asymptotically tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy
that precisely map the impact of cooperation on the quality of tree networks
and we find that weak forms of cooperation already yield a significantly
improved Price of Anarchy. Moreover, for general networks we show that enhanced
cooperation yields close to optimal networks for a wide range of edge prices.

from silent videos of talking faces with no restriction on head poses or
vocabulary. Current works mainly use sequence-to-sequence models to solve this
problem, either in an autoregressive architecture or a flow-based
non-autoregressive architecture. However, these models suffer from several
drawbacks: 1) Instead of directly generating audios, they use a two-stage
pipeline that first generates mel-spectrograms and then reconstructs audios
from the spectrograms. This causes cumbersome deployment and degradation of
speech quality due to error propagation; 2) The audio reconstruction algorithm
used by these models limits the inference speed and audio quality, while neural
vocoders are not available for these models since their output spectrograms are
not accurate enough; 3) The autoregressive model suffers from high inference
latency, while the flow-based model has high memory occupancy: neither of them
is efficient enough in both time and memory usage. To tackle these problems, we
propose FastLTS, a non-autoregressive end-to-end model which can directly

challenges in stabilizing operational strategies. From the perspective of
production management, it is important to improve the profitability of an
enterprise by exploiting the different timing of the selling season in
different markets to develop an operational strategy that is optimized and
configured on a global scale. This paper examines the above issue with an
insightful model of selling the product to two markets (a primary and a
secondary market) with multiple risks of changes in the market environment and
nonoverlapping selling seasons. We refer to this problem as the ""global robust
newsvendor"" problem. We provide closed-form solutions of the optimal operation
strategy for demand-independent and demand-related scenarios for the above two
market stochastic systems. The closed-form solutions fully reflect the
influence of the relationship between supply and demand on strategy selection.
We find that the demand correlation and the lack of demand information will not
substantially affect the operation strategy, and the enterprise's industrial
chain and supply chain remain stable. However, the reduction of inter-market
tariffs or logistics costs will cause changes, and the existence of the
secondary market will lead to more capacity planning in the primary market. In
addition, our model explicitly considers the impact of exchange rate
uncertainty on operating strategies.

means that species which would survive in the Lotka-Volterra model can become
extinct. These noise-driven extinctions are the focus of the paper. We find
that, for increasing complexity of interactions, ecological communities
generally become less prone to extinctions induced by demographic noise. An
exception are systems composed entirely of predator-prey pairs. These systems
are known to be stable in deterministic Lotka-Volterra models with random

co-finetuning outperforms traditional transfer learning when using the same

multiple ``upstream'' datasets to further improve performance. In particular,
co-finetuning significantly improves the performance on rare classes in our

(J094124.028+394441.95) with the VLA maps at 4.9 GHz and 8.3 GHz that we built
based on archival data, establishes this X-shaped radio galaxy (XRG) as a
singularly robust case where the 'wings' exhibit a distinctly flatter radio
spectrum than the primary lobes. The details of its anomalous spectral gradient
are unravelled here with unprecedented precision. We also highlight the 'double
boomerang' type radio morphology of this XRG. It appears plausible that the
peculiar spectral gradient in this XRG is owed to particle acceleration
associated with the rebounding of the collimated backflows of synchrotron
plasma streaming through its two primary lobes, as they impinge upon and
encounter the magnetic tension in the prominent dusty disk of the elliptical
galaxy hosting this XRG. We also draw attention to an intriguing new
morphological peculiarity among XRGs, namely, a lateral offset observed between
the (parallel) axes of the two primary radio lobes.

along with consequent injuries, are reported as major public health problems
all over the world. For patients who do not require mechanical support,
vibrotactile feedback interfaces have proven to be a successful approach in
restoring balance. Most of the existing strategies assess trunk or head tilt
and velocity or plantar forces, and are limited to the analysis of stance. On
the other hand, central to balance control is the need to maintain the body's
centre of pressure (CoP) within feasible limits of the support polygon (SP), as
in standing, or on track to a new SP, as in walking. Hence, this paper proposes
an exploratory study to investigate whether vibrotactile feedback can be
employed to lead human CoP during walking. The ErgoTac-Belt vibrotactile device
is introduced to instruct the users about the direction to take, both in the
antero-posterior and medio-lateral axes. An anticipatory strategy is adopted
here, to give the users enough time to react to the stimuli. Experiments on ten
healthy subjects demonstrated the promising capability of the proposed device
to guide the users' CoP along a predefined reference path, with similar
performance as the one achieved with visual feedback. Future developments will
investigate our strategy and device in guiding the CoP of elderly or
individuals with vestibular impairments, who may not be aware of or, able to
figure out, a safe and ergonomic CoP path.

This means a model once trained can accurately predict performance metrics such

or the deployment of operators to hardware changes at runtime. That way, the
model can be used to solve tasks such as optimizing the placement of operators
to minimize the end-to-end latency of a streaming query or maximize its

in the training set. One representative solution is to directly learn an
embedding function associating visual features with corresponding class
semantics for recognizing new classes. Many methods extend upon this solution,
and recent ones are especially keen on extracting rich features from images,
e.g. attribute features. These attribute features are normally extracted within
each individual image; however, the common traits for features across images

propose a new framework to boost ZSL by explicitly learning attribute
prototypes beyond images and contrastively optimizing them with attribute-level
features within images. Besides the novel architecture, two elements are
highlighted for attribute representations: a new prototype generation module is
designed to generate attribute prototypes from attribute semantics; a hard
example-based contrastive optimization scheme is introduced to reinforce
attribute-level features in the embedding space. We explore two alternative
backbones, CNN-based and transformer-based, to build our framework and conduct

out-of-time-order correlator derived from the Loschmidt echo signal in the
quantum phases of the model and show that its exponential growth cannot be

that the collective spin observable in the two-mode Dicke model quickly
saturates to its long-time average value, and shows very good agreement between
its diagonal ensemble average and microcanonical average even for a small
number of spins. We show that the temporal fluctuations of the expectation
value of the collective spin observable around its average are small and
decrease with the effective system size, which leads to thermalization of the
spin system.

ecosystem stability and functions is of major importance in itself and for the

loss in species richness and homogenization of species pools as well as the
fragmentation of natural habitats and groundwater pollution. Constructed
wetlands stand as nature-based solutions (NBS) to buffer the degradation of
water quality by intercepting the transfer of particles, nutrients and
pesticides between crops and surface waters. In karstic watersheds where
sinkholes short-cut surface water directly to groundwater increasing water
resource vulnerability, constructed wetlands are recommended to mitigate
agricultural pollutants. Constructed wetlands also have the potential to
improve landscape connectivity by providing refuge and breeding sites for
wildlife, especially for amphibians. We propose here a methodology to identify
optimal locations for water pollution mitigation using constructed wetlands
from the perspective of habitat connectivity. We use ecological niche modelling
at the regional scale to model the potential of habitat suitability for nine
amphibian species, and to infer how the landscape impedes species movements. We
combine those results to graph theory to identify connectivity priorities at
the operational scale of an agricultural catchment area. Our framework allowed
us to identify optimal areas from the point of view of the species, to analyze
the effect of multifunctional constructed wetlands aiming to both reduce water
pollution and to improve amphibian species habitat overall connectivity. More
generally, we show the potential of habitat connectivity assessment to improve
multifunctionality of NBS for pollution mitigation.

present an experiment we did to explore minimalism in games using a bottom-up
approach. We invited a small group of professional game designers and a larger
group of game design students to participate in a seminal experiment on
minimalism in game design. We started from the most basic game elements: one
pixel and one key which provide the least amount of information we can display
and reasonably the most elementary action players can perform. We designed a
game that starts with a black pixel and asks players to press a key when the
pixel turns white. This minimal game, almost a Skinner box, captures the
essential elements of the mechanics of games like ""The Impossible Game,"" which
asks players to do nothing more than press a key at the right moment. We
presented this game concept to the professional game designers and challenged
them to create other games with the least amount of player interaction and
displayed information. We did not specify any constraints (as usually done in
other contexts) and left them free to express their view of minimalistic game
design. We repeated the experiment with 100+ students attending a master-level
course on video game design and development at our institution. We then
analyzed the creations of the two groups, discussing the idea of minimalistic

multi-energy management systems. It does not require a model a priori -
reducing the upfront and ongoing project-specific engineering effort and is
capable of learning better representations of the underlying system dynamics.
However, vanilla RL does not provide constraint satisfaction guarantees -
resulting in various potentially unsafe interactions within its safety-critical
environment. In this paper, we present two novel safe RL methods, namely
SafeFallback and GiveSafe, where the safety constraint formulation is decoupled
from the RL formulation. These provide hard-constraint, rather than soft- and
chance-constraint, satisfaction guarantees both during training a (near)
optimal policy (which involves exploratory and exploitative, i.e. greedy,
steps) as well as during deployment of any policy (e.g. random agents or
offline trained RL agents). This without the need of solving a mathematical
program, resulting in less computational power requirements and a more flexible
constraint function formulation (no derivative information is required). In a
simulated multi-energy systems case study we have shown that both methods start
with a significantly higher utility (i.e. useful policy) compared to a vanilla
RL benchmark and Optlayer benchmark (94,6% and 82,8% compared to 35,5% and
77,8%) and that the proposed SafeFallback method even can outperform the
vanilla RL benchmark (102,9% to 100%). We conclude that both methods are viably
safety constraint handling techniques applicable beyond RL, as demonstrated
with random policies while still providing hard-constraint guarantees.

Galactic-scale molecular cloud complexes, such as the G120 Complex, into
Galactic-scale filaments, and it also contributes to the destruction of the
filaments; while stellar feedback creates interconnected superbubbles whose
expansion injects peculiar velocities into the ISM. The Galactic-scale
molecular gas clumps are often precursors of the filaments and the
Galactic-scale filaments are transient structures under a constant stretch by
shear. This evolutionary sequence sets a foundation to interpret other gas

it with quasi-shuffle algebras over words. Its graded dual is the bialgebra
TSym introduced by N. Bergeron and al which is described by the lightening
splitting of a tree. As a consequence, this shows that TSym has a (1,

in three parts with convenient compatibilities. This can be extended to (3,

notion of (3, 2)--dendriform bialgebra. This is a Hopf algebra, where we can
split the product in three pieces and the coproduct in two with Hopf

methodology with a focus on mixed-integer linear optimization problems which
combines ideas from the chance constraint and constraint learning literature.
Chance constraints set a probabilistic confidence level for a single or a set
of constraints to be fulfilled, whereas the constraint learning methodology
aims to model the functional relationship between the problem variables through
predictive models. One of the main issues when establishing a learned
constraint arises when we need to set further bounds for its response variable:
the fulfillment of these is directly related to the accuracy of the predictive
model and its probabilistic behaviour. In this sense, CCL makes use of
linearizable machine learning models to estimate conditional quantiles of the
learned variables, providing a data-driven solution for chance constraints. An
open-access software has been developed to be used by practitioners.
Furthermore, benefits from CCL have been tested in two real-world case studies,
proving how robustness is added to optimal solutions when probabilistic bounds
are set for learned constraints.

However, as one departs from the typical ""Alice versus Bob"" setting into the

concept of entanglement is defined among these identical particles. Our
endeavor to recover the notion of subsystems, or mathematically speaking, the
tensor product structure of the Hilbert space, lead to two natural pictures of
defining fermionic entanglement: the particle picture and the mode picture. In
the particle picture, entanglement characterizes the deviation of a fermionic
quantum state from the non-interacting ones, e.g., single Slater determinants.
In the mode picture, we recover the notion of subsystems, by referring to the
partitioning of the orbital/mode that the fermions occupy, which allows us to
naturally adopt the formalism of entanglement between distinguishable
constituents. Both pictures reveal essential and interconnected aspects of
fermionic entanglement, and thus offer precise tools for studying electron
entanglement in highly relevant systems such as atoms and molecules. We
showcase here two applications: i) resolving the correlation paradox in the

Wav2Vec 2.0 (W2V2), have become the backbone of many speech tasks. In this
paper, to achieve speaker diarisation and speech recognition using a single
model, a tandem multitask training (TMT) method is proposed to fine-tune W2V2.
For speaker diarisation, the tasks of voice activity detection (VAD) and
speaker classification (SC) are required, and connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) is used for ASR. The multitask framework implements VAD,
SC, and ASR using an early layer, middle layer, and late layer of W2V2, which
coincides with the order of segmenting the audio with VAD, clustering the
segments based on speaker embeddings, and transcribing each segment with ASR.
Experimental results on the augmented multi-party (AMI) dataset showed that
using different W2V2 layers for VAD, SC, and ASR from the earlier to later
layers for TMT not only saves computational cost, but also reduces diarisation
error rates (DERs). Joint fine-tuning of VAD, SC, and ASR yielded 16%/17%
relative reductions of DER with manual/automatic segmentation respectively, and
consistent reductions in speaker attributed word error rate, compared to the
baseline with separately fine-tuned models.

as a reflection (or ""bounce"") in the connection variable, defined by the
inverse comoving Hubble length ($b=\dot a$, on-shell). We study the quantum
cosmology of this process. We use a formalism for obtaining relational time
variables either through the demotion of the constants of Nature to integration
constants, or by identifying fluid constants of motion. We extend its previous
application to a toy model (radiation and $\Lambda$) to the realistic setting
of a transition from dust matter to $\Lambda$ domination. In the dust and
$\Lambda$ model two time variables may be defined, conjugate to $\Lambda$ and
to the dust constant of motion, and we work out the monochromatic solutions to
the Schr\""odinger equation representing the Hamiltonian constraint. As for
their radiation and $\Lambda$ counterparts, these solutions exhibit ""ringing"",
whereby the incident and reflected waves interfere, leading to oscillations in
the amplitude. In the semi-classical approximation we find that, close to the
bounce, the probability distribution becomes double-peaked, one peak following
a trajectory close to the classical limit but with a Hubble parameter slightly
shifted downwards, the other with a value of $b$ stuck at its minimum
$b=b_\star$. Still closer to the transition, the distribution is better
approximated by an exponential distribution, with a single peak at $b=b_\star$,
and a (more representative) average $b$ biased towards a value higher than the
classical trajectory. Thus, we obtain a distinctive prediction for the average
Hubble parameter with redshift: slightly lower than its classical value when
$z\approx 0$, but potentially much higher than the classical prediction around
$z\sim 0.64$, where the bounce most likely occurred. The implications for the
""Hubble tension"" have not escaped us.

nature scene dataset and then fine-tuned on a few specific task labeling data
is the paradigm that has dominated the knowledge transfer learning. It has
reached the status of consensus solution for task-aware model training in
remote sensing domain (RSD). Unfortunately, due to different categories of
imaging data and stiff challenges of data annotation, there is not a large
enough and uniform remote sensing dataset to support large-scale pretraining in
RSD. Moreover, pretraining models on large-scale nature scene datasets by
supervised learning and then directly fine-tuning on diverse downstream tasks
seems to be a crude method, which is easily affected by inevitable labeling
noise, severe domain gaps and task-aware discrepancies. Thus, in this paper,
considering the self-supervised pretraining and powerful vision transformer
(ViT) architecture, a concise and effective knowledge transfer learning
strategy called ConSecutive PreTraining (CSPT) is proposed based on the idea of
not stopping pretraining in natural language processing (NLP), which can
gradually bridge the domain gap and transfer knowledge from the nature scene
domain to the RSD. The proposed CSPT also can release the huge potential of
unlabeled data for task-aware model training. Finally, extensive experiments
are carried out on twelve datasets in RSD involving three types of downstream
tasks (e.g., scene classification, object detection and land cover
classification) and two types of imaging data (e.g., optical and SAR). The
results show that by utilizing the proposed CSPT for task-aware model training,
almost all downstream tasks in RSD can outperform the previous method of
supervised pretraining-then-fine-tuning and even surpass the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance without any expensive labeling consumption and careful model
design.

explore an alternative paradigm in which AI is combined with physics-based

collective variables, akin to those used in enhanced sampled simulations, are
constructed using a machine learning (ML) model trained on data gathered from a
single system. Through the ML-constructed collective variables, it becomes
possible to identify critical molecular interactions in the system of interest,
the modulation of which enables a systematic tailoring of the system's free

to engineer allosteric regulation, and uniaxial strain fluctuations in a
complex disordered elastic network. Its successful application in these two
cases provides insights regarding how functionality is governed in systems

electron with a proton, single Higgs production takes place via so-called
charged-current ($e^-p \to \nu_e H j$) and neutral-current ($e^-p \to e^-H j$)
processes. We explore the potential of the azimuthal angle correlation between
the forward jet and scattered neutrino or electron in probing the non-standard
$HVV$ couplings at the collider center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} \approx
1.3$~TeV. We choose the most general modifications (of $CP$-even and $CP$-odd
nature) to these couplings due to new physics effects beyond the standard
model. We derive exclusion limits on new physics parameters of $HVV$ couplings
as a function of integrated luminosity at $95\%$ C.L. using the azimuthal
angular correlations in charged- and neutral-current processes. We find that
using 1000 $fb^{-1}$ data, the standard model-like new physics parameters in
$HWW$ and $HZZ$ couplings can be constrained with accuracies of $4\%$ and
$15\%$, respectively. The least constrained $CP$-even parameters of $HWW$
coupling can be as large as 0.04, while those of $HZZ$ coupling can have values
around 0.31. Allowed values of $CP$-odd parameters in $HWW$ and $HZZ$ couplings

scene understanding. By automatically detecting road regions that are occluded
from the vehicle's vantage point, we can proactively alert a manual driver or a
self-driving system to potential causes of accidents (e.g., draw attention to a
road region from which a child may spring out). Detecting blind spots in full
3D would be challenging, as 3D reasoning on the fly even if the car is equipped
with LiDAR would be prohibitively expensive and error prone. We instead propose
to learn to estimate blind spots in 2D, just from a monocular camera. We
achieve this in two steps. We first introduce an automatic method for
generating ``ground-truth'' blind spot training data for arbitrary driving
videos by leveraging monocular depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and
SLAM. The key idea is to reason in 3D but from 2D images by defining blind
spots as those road regions that are currently invisible but become visible in
the near future. We construct a large-scale dataset with this automatic offline
blind spot estimation, which we refer to as Road Blind Spot (RBS) dataset.
Next, we introduce BlindSpotNet (BSN), a simple network that fully leverages
this dataset for fully automatic estimation of frame-wise blind spot
probability maps for arbitrary driving videos. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the validity of our RBS Dataset and the effectiveness of our BSN.

the inner gravitational potential, and star formation quenching in 215
non-active galaxies across Hubble sequence from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral
Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Our results show that galaxies with similar CVCs
tend to have a certain star-formation quenching pattern. To explore these
findings in more details, we construct kpc-resolved relations of the equivalent
width of the H$\alpha$ ($W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$) versus the amplitude ($V_c$) and
shape ($\beta= d\ln V_c/ d\ln R$) of the circular velocity at given radius. We
find that the $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}-V_c$ is a declining relationship, where the
retired regions of the galaxies (the ones with $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ values below
3 \r{A}) tend to have higher $V_c$. Differently, $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}-\beta$ is a
bi-modal relationship, characterised by two peaks: concentration of the star
forming regions at a positive $\beta$ (rising CVC) and another one of the
retired regions with a negative $\beta$ (declining CVC). Our results show that
both the amplitude of the CVC, driven by the mass of the galaxies, and the
shape of the CVC, reflecting the internal structure of the galaxies, play an
important role in galaxy's quenching history.

a geometric field (every element is either invertible or else zero). Krull's
lemma for the related notion of prime ideal follows by passing to rings of

and researchers. The advantages of using this format compared to pcap are that
it contains fewer data, is less privacy intrusive, and is easier to collect and
process. However, having less data does mean that this format might not be able
to capture important network behaviour as all information is summarised into
statistics. Much research aims to overcome this disadvantage through the use of
machine learning, for instance, to detect attacks within a network. Many
approaches can be used to pre-process the NetFlow data before it is used to
train the machine learning algorithms. However, many of these approaches simply
apply existing methods to the data, not considering the specific properties of
network data. We argue that for data originating from software systems, such as
NetFlow or software logs, similarities in frequency and contexts of feature
values are more important than similarities in the value itself. In this work,
we, therefore, propose an encoding algorithm that directly takes the frequency
and the context of the feature values into account when the data is being
processed. Different types of network behaviours can be clustered using this
encoding, thus aiding the process of detecting anomalies within the network.
From windows of these clusters obtained from monitoring a clean system, we
learn state machine behavioural models for anomaly detection. These models are
very well-suited to modelling the cyclic and repetitive patterns present in
NetFlow data. We evaluate our encoding on a new dataset that we created for
detecting problems in Kubernetes clusters and on two well-known public NetFlow
datasets. The obtained performance results of the state machine models are
comparable to existing works that use many more features and require both clean
and infected data as training input.

to the current AI infrastructure. Among them, Trojan attacks are the hardest to
defend against. In this paper, we first introduce a variation of the Badnet
kind of attacks that introduces Trojan backdoors to multiple target classes and
allows triggers to be placed anywhere in the image. The former makes it more
potent and the latter makes it extremely easy to carry out the attack in the
physical space. The state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods fail with this
threat model. To defend against this attack, we first introduce a trigger
reverse-engineering mechanism that uses multiple images to recover a variety of
potential triggers. We then propose a detection mechanism by measuring the
transferability of such recovered triggers. A Trojan trigger will have very
high transferability i.e. they make other images also go to the same class. We
study many practical advantages of our attack method and then demonstrate the
detection performance using a variety of image datasets. The experimental
results show the superior detection performance of our method over the

au radial range (Maksimovic et al. 2020). In this article we show that recent
measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) are compatible with an extension
closer to the Sun of the latter Helios classification. For instance the well
established bulk speed/proton temperature (u,Tp) correlation and bulk
speed/electron temperature (u,Te) anti-correlation, together with the
acceleration of the slowest winds, are verified in PSP data. We also model the
combined PSP and Helios data, using empirical Parker-like models for which the
solar wind undergoes an ""iso-poly"" expansion: isothermal in the corona, then
polytropic at distances larger than the sonic point radius. The polytropic
indices are derived from the observed temperature and density gradients. Our
modelling reveals that the electron thermal pressure has a major contribution
in the acceleration process of slow and intermediate winds (in the range of
300-500 km/s at 1 au), over a broad range of distances and that the global
(electron and protons) thermal energy, alone, is able to explain the
acceleration profiles. Moreover, we show that the very slow solar wind requires
in addition to the observed pressure gradients, another source of acceleration.

pressing a styrene sphere of 15 mm diameter against a 44 x 44 x 47 mm$^3$
cuboid made of 5% wt. gelatin, inside a circular polariscope, and with a range
of forces. The emerging light rays are processed by considering that the
retardation of each ray carries the cumulative effect of traversing the
contact-induced axisymmetric stress field. Then, assuming Hertzian theory is
valid, the retardation is analytically calculated for each ray and compared to
the experimental one. Furthermore, a finite element model of the process
introduces the effect of finite displacements and strains. Beyond the
qualitative comparison of the retardation fields, the experimental,
theoretical, and numerical results are quantitatively compared in terms of the
maximum equivalent stress, surface displacement, and contact radius dimensions.
A favorable agreement is found at lower force levels, where the assumptions of
Hertz theory hold, whereas deviations are observed at higher force levels. A
major discovery of this work is that at the maximum equivalent stress location,
all three components of principal stress can be determined experimentally, and
show satisfactory agreement with theoretical and numerical ones in our
measurement range. This provides valuable insight into Hertzian contact
problems since the maximum equivalent stress controls the initiation of plastic
deformation or failure. The measured displacement and contact radii also
reasonably agree with the theoretical and numerical ones. Finally, the
limitations that arise due to the linearization of this problem are explored.

a novel interactiOn Pattern disenTangling (OPT) method, to disentangle not only
the joint value function into agent-wise value functions for decentralized
execution, but also the entity interactions into interaction prototypes, each
of which represents an underlying interaction pattern within a subgroup of the
entities. OPT facilitates filtering the noisy interactions between irrelevant
entities and thus significantly improves generalizability as well as
interpretability. Specifically, OPT introduces a sparse disagreement mechanism
to encourage sparsity and diversity among discovered interaction prototypes.
Then the model selectively restructures these prototypes into a compact
interaction pattern by an aggregator with learnable weights. To alleviate the
training instability issue caused by partial observability, we propose to
maximize the mutual information between the aggregation weights and the history
behaviors of each agent. Experiments on both single-task and multi-task
benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the
state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code is available at

their features, such as mono- or multilayer coverage, binding surface,
functional groups, valence electrons, and H-bond acceptors and donors. The
performance of the model is assessed with five-fold and leave-one-molecule-out
cross validation. Predictions are generally accurate, with differences between
predicted and literature binding energies values of less than $\pm$20\%. The
validated model is used to predict the binding energies of twenty one molecules

binding energy values are not known. A simplified model is used to visualize
where the snowlines of these molecules would be located in a protoplanetary

we consider a semiconductor/superconductor hybrid device with an in-plane
magnetic field, which exhibits several Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The number
and orientation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in this device can be readily
controlled by the applied magnetic field, which in turn alters the noise

substantially lower than two, whenever the charge dynamics is governed by a
large number of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Using experimentally relevant
parameters, we make a number of specific predictions for the noise spectra,
that can be used as direct evidence of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. In
particular, we find that the Fano factor as a function of magnetic field and
spin-orbit coupling exhibits characteristic discontinuities at the transition
lines that separate phases with different number of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces.

the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for the purpose of inverse modeling. The EnKF
is a data assimilation approach that forecasts and updates parameter estimates
sequentially in time as observations are being collected. The updating step is
based on the experimental covariances computed from an ensemble of realizations
and the updates are given as linear combinations of the differences between
observations and forecasted system state values. The ERFF replaces the linear
combination in the update step with a non-linear function represented by a
random forest. In this way, the non-linear relationships between the parameters
to be updated and the observations can be captured and a better update
produced. The ERFF is demonstrated for the purpose of log-conductivity
identification from piezometric head observations in a number of scenarios with
varying degrees of heterogeneity (log-conductivity variances going from 1 up to
6.25 (ln m/d)2), number of realizations in the ensemble (50 or 100), and number
of piezometric head observations (18 or 36). In all scenarios, the ERFF works
well, being able to reconstruct the log-conductivity spatial heterogeneity
while matching the observed piezometric heads at selected control points. For
benchmarking purposes the ERFF is compared to the restart EnKF to find that the
ERFF is superior to the EnKF for the number of ensemble realizations used
(small in typical EnKF applications). Only when the number of realizations
grows to 500, the restart EnKF is able to match the performance of the ERFF,
albeit at triple the computational cost.

are well known in aggregated communication data, temporal patterns of
reciprocal information exchange have received far less attention. Here we
propose measures of reciprocity based on the time ordering of interactions and
explore them in data from multiple communication channels, including calls,
messaging and social media. By separating each channel into reciprocal and
non-reciprocal temporal networks, we find persistent trends that point to the
distinct roles of one-on-one exchange versus information broadcast. We
implement several null models of communication activity, which identify memory,
a higher tendency to repeat interactions with past contacts, as a key source of
reciprocity. When adding memory to a model of activity-driven, time-varying
networks, we reproduce the levels of reciprocity seen in empirical data. Our
work adds to the theoretical understanding of the emergence of reciprocity in
human communication systems, hinting at the mechanisms behind the formation of
norms in social exchange and large-scale cooperation.

the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Their atmospheric properties
remain largely unaltered by tidal or radiative effects of the host star, and
their orbital arrangement reflects a different, and less extreme, migrational
history compared to close-in objects. The sample of long-period exoplanets with
well determined masses and radii is still limited, but a growing number of
long-period objects reveal themselves in the TESS data. Our goal is to vet and
confirm single transit planet candidates detected in the TESS space-based
photometric data through spectroscopic and photometric follow up observations
with ground-based instruments. We use the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS)
to photometrically monitor the candidates in order to observe additional
transits. We report the discovery of two massive, warm Jupiter-size planets,
one orbiting the F8-type star TOI-5153 and the other orbiting the G1-type star
NGTS-20 (=TOI-5152). From our spectroscopic analysis, both stars are metal-rich
with a metallicity of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. Follow-up radial velocity
observations were carried out with CORALIE, CHIRON, FEROS, and HARPS. TOI-5153
hosts a 20.33 day period planet with a planetary mass of 3.26 (+-0.18) Mj, a
radius of 1.06 (+-0.04) Rj , and an orbital eccentricity of 0.091 (+-0.026).
NGTS-20 b is a 2.98 (+-0.16) Mj planet with a radius of 1.07 (+-0.04) Rj on an
eccentric (0.432 +- 0.023) orbit with an orbital period of 54.19 days. Both
planets are metal-enriched and their heavy element content is in line with the
previously reported mass-metallicity relation for gas giants. Both warm
Jupiters orbit moderately bright host stars making these objects valuable
targets for follow-up studies of the planetary atmosphere and measurement of
the spin-orbit angle of the system.

small ship performance, a feature balance operation (FBO) to improve scale

Experimental results on two public SSDD and HRSID datasets reveal that
MAI-SE-Net outperforms the other nine competitive models, better than the

3.0% detection AP and 2.4% segmentation AP on HRSID.

flamelets is investigated numerically. Lean conditions are established at an
equivalence ratio of 0.7. Detailed-chemistry, one-dimensional simulations are
performed on a reactants-to-products counter-flow configuration with an applied
strain rate ranging from $a=100 \, {\rm s}^{-1}$ to $a=10000 \, {\rm s}^{-1}$
and the \texttt{GRI3.0} mechanism. Following a similar setup, two-dimensional
direct numerical simulations are also conducted for representative strain rates
of $2000 \, {\rm s}^{-1}$ and $5000 \, {\rm s}^{-1}$. Both solutions show a
decreasing NO$_{\rm x}$ trend as the applied strain rate is increased. This
decreasing emission outcome is highlighted for the first time in this study for
lean pure-hydrogen flamelets. A deep analysis of the 2D solution underlines
that there is no production of NO$_{\rm x}$ in the second dimension, thus
proving that the emission trend is not a result of a setup preconditioning, but
is instead a direct physical effect of stretch on the flame. Furthermore, a
detailed analysis of the NO$_{\rm x}$ formation pathways at $a=2000 \, {\rm
s}^{-1}$ and $a=5000 \, {\rm s}^{-1}$ is performed. Thermal NO$_{\rm x}$ and
NNH pathways are shown to both contribute significantly to the total NO$_{\rm
x}$ production. While the NNH route contribution is roughly constant at
different strain rates, a significant decrease is observed along the thermal
NO$_{\rm x}$ route. Overall, results show that lean and highly-strained
hydrogen flames experience a significant decrease of NO$_{\rm x}$. This
property is discussed and analysed in the paper.

approach based on quantile forecasting to represent the uncertainty originating
in DNs at the TN level. First, we aquire a required rich dataset employing

time-indexed family of integral or normal $k$-currents $t \mapsto T_t$ in

T_t$ is the Lie derivative of $T_t$ with respect to $b_t$. Written in
coordinates for different values of $k$, this PDE encompasses the classical
transport equation ($k = d$), the continuity equation ($k = 0$), as well as the
equations for the transport of dislocation lines in crystals ($k = 1$) and
membranes in liquids ($k =d-1$). The top-dimensional and bottom-dimensional
cases have received a great deal of attention in connection with the
DiPerna--Lions and Ambrosio theories of Regular Lagrangian Flows. On the other
hand, very little is rigorously known at present in the

transport equation for arbitrary $k$ and in the case of boundaryless currents
$T_t$, covering in particular existence and uniqueness of solutions, structure
theorems, rectifiability, and a number of Rademacher-type differentiability
results. The latter yield, given an absolutely continuous (in time) path $t

namely a driving vector field $b_t$. This subtle question turns out to be
intimately related to the critical set of the evolution, a new notion
introduced in this work, which is closely related to Sard's theorem and
concerns singularities that are ''smeared out in time''. Our differentiability
results are sharp, which we demonstrate through an explicit example.

of k colors in d-dimensional manifolds, we investigate the random submanifolds
of different codimensions, as the number of vertices in the triangulation

homological percolation and other topological properties. Finally, we explore a

applications, particularly in contexts where security and reliability are
critical aspects. While the definition of anomaly strictly depends on the
domain framework, it is often impractical or too time consuming to obtain a
fully labelled dataset. The use of unsupervised models to overcome the lack of
labels often fails to catch domain specific anomalies as they rely on general
definitions of outlier. This paper suggests a new active learning based
approach, ALIF, to solve this problem by reducing the number of required labels
and tuning the detector towards the definition of anomaly provided by the user.
The proposed approach is particularly appealing in the presence of a Decision
Support System (DSS), a case that is increasingly popular in real-world
scenarios. While it is common that DSS embedded with anomaly detection
capabilities rely on unsupervised models, they don't have a way to improve
their performance: ALIF is able to enhance the capabilities of DSS by
exploiting the user feedback during common operations. ALIF is a lightweight
modification of the popular Isolation Forest that proved superior performances

theory for interlayer exciton-exciton interactions including both the dipolar
nature of interlayer excitons as well as their fermionic substructure, which
gives rise to an attractive fermionic exchange. We find that these interactions
contribute to a drift force resulting in highly non-linear exciton propagation
at elevated densities in the MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We show that the
propagation can be tuned by changing the number of hBN spacers between the TMD
layers or by adjusting the dielectric environment. In particular, although
counter-intuitive, we reveal that interlayer excitons in free-standing samples
propagate slower than excitons in hBN-encapsulated TMDs - due to an enhancement
of the net Coulomb-drift with stronger environmental screening. Overall, our
work contributes to a better microscopic understanding of the interlayer
exciton transport in technologically promising atomically thin semiconductors.

we derive a variance expression for a set of persistence diagrams exhibiting a
multi-matching between the persistence points known as a grouping. Moreover, we
propose a condition for groupings, which we refer to as flatness: sets of
persistence diagrams that exhibit flat groupings give rise to unique Fr\'echet
means. We derive a finite sample convergence result for general groupings,
which results in convergence for Fr\'echet means if the groupings are flat.
Finally, we interpret flat groupings in a recently-proposed general framework
of Fr\'echet means in Alexandrov geometry. Together with recent results from
Alexandrov geometry, this allows for the first derivation of a finite sample
convergence rate for sets of persistence diagrams and lays the ground for
viability of the Fr\'echet mean as a practical statistical summary of

leads to symmetry restoration near the black hole horizon, prompting the
development of the scalar wall in its vicinity. The wall thickness depends on
the bare mass of the scalar and can be much smaller than the Schwarzschild

invariant effectively becomes linear, and no walls are formed. We find
approximate analytical solutions for the scalar field in the test field regime,

demand by dynamically adjusting the workload (or demand) embedding, i.e., the
mapping of communication requests into the network topology. SANs can thus
reduce routing costs for frequently communicating node pairs by paying a cost
for adjusting the embedding. This is particularly beneficial when the demand
has structure, which the network can adapt to. Demand can be represented in the
form of a demand graph, which is defined by the set of network nodes (vertices)
and the set of pairwise communication requests (edges). Thus, adapting to the
demand can be interpreted by embedding the demand graph to the network
topology. This can be challenging both when the demand graph is known in
advance (offline) and when it revealed edge-by-edge (online). The difficulty
also depends on whether we aim at constructing a static topology or a dynamic
(self-adjusting) one that improves the embedding as more parts of the demand

different, however: it is based on the celebrated method of Chambolle and Pock

$O(\kappa^{1/4})$, compared to $O(\kappa^{1/2})$ of ProxSkip), and performs a
deterministic number of local steps instead. Like ProxSkip, our method can be

Unlike previous atomic-level simulation approaches, our method does not rely on

electric-field-induced forces on atoms are explicitly calculated and added to
the interatomic forces. Atoms then simply move according to the laws of
classical molecular dynamics and are ""evaporated"" when the external force
overcomes interatomic bonding. This approach thus makes no ad-hoc assumptions
concerning evaporation fields and criteria, which makes the simulation fully
physics-based and ""ab-initio"" apart from the interatomic potential. As proof of
principle, we perform simulations to determine material dependent critical
voltages which allow assessing the evaporation fields and the corresponding
steady-state tip shapes in different metals. We also extract critical
evaporation fields in elemental metals and sublimation energies in a high
entropy alloy to have a more direct comparison with tabulated values. In

successfully reproduce the enhanced zone lines observed in experimental field

bifurcation in the Swift-Hohenberg equation using a novel approach based on
geometric blow-up. We show that the formally derived multiple scales ansatz
which is known from classical modulation theory can be adapted for use in the
fast-slow setting, by reformulating it as a blow-up transformation. This leads
to dynamically simpler modulation equations posed in the blown-up space, via a
formal procedure which directly extends the established approach to the
time-dependent setting. The modulation equations take the form of
non-autonomous Ginzburg-Landau equations, which can be analysed within the
blow-up. The asymptotics of solutions in weighted Sobelev spaces are given in
two different cases: (i) A symmetric case featuring a delayed loss of
stability, and (ii) A second case in which the symmetry is broken by a source
term. In order to characterise the dynamics of the Swift-Hohenberg equation
itself we derive rigorous estimates on the error of the dynamic modulation
approximation. These estimates are obtained by bounding weak solutions to an
evolution equation for the error which is also posed in the blown-up space.
Using the error estimates obtained, we are able to infer the asymptotics of a
large class of solutions to the dynamic Swift-Hohenberg equation. We provide
rigorous asymptotics for solutions in both cases (i) and (ii). We also prove
the existence of the delayed loss of stability in the symmetric case (i), and
provide a lower bound for the delay time.

controls at $>99\%$ significance level. We also simultaneously match the
control galaxies in stellar mass, redshift and local density to assess the role
of the environment. The null hypothesis can be rejected at $>99\%$ confidence
level even after matching the environment. Our analysis shows that the minor
interactions quench galaxies in the present Universe. The degree of quenching
decreases with the increasing pair separation and plateaus beyond 50 kpc.
Combining data from the Galaxy Zoo and Galaxy Zoo2, we find that only $\sim
1\%$ galaxies have a dominant bulge, $4\%-7\%$ galaxies host a bar, and
$5\%-10\%$ galaxies show the AGN activity in minor pairs. The quenching in
minor pairs can not be entirely explained by their environment and the presence
of bar, bulge or AGN. The more massive companion satisfies the criteria for
mass quenching in most of the minor pairs. We propose that the stripping and
starvation likely caused the quenching in the less massive companion at a later

characterized, which extends the capabilities of such generators used in

that resemble the shape of two bow-ties. Hot-wire anemometry and high-speed
imaging are performed to characterize the non-reacting flow produced by the
generator and the blades dynamics, respectively. Two mean bulk flow velocities
of 5.0 and 7.0 m/s are examined. For comparison purposes, in addition to the
developed generator, tests are also performed for a free jet as well as one and
two perforated plates. The results show that the centerline root mean square
velocity fluctuations can become about 1.8~m/s, which is several folds larger
than that in the literature for reacting flows generated by active grids. For
the newly developed device, the power-law decay of the one-dimensional kinetic
energy is -1.0 and -1.3 for the mean bulk flow velocities of 5.0 and 7.0 m/s,
respectively. The normalized energy dissipation rate is smallest for the newly
developed device, while the energy dissipation rate is the largest. The
spectral analysis of the velocity data does not show dominant frequencies equal
to the blades rotation frequencies; and, the one dimensional kinetic energy and
dissipation spectra follow -5/3 and 1/3 power-law relations. It is shown that,
the small eddies produced by the newly developed device dissipate the turbulent
kinetic energy faster than those corresponding to the rest of the tested

  Activity in Excitable Media",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many physical, chemical and biological processes rely on intrinsic
oscillations to employ resonance responses to external stimuli of certain
frequency. Such resonance phenomena in biological systems are typically
explained by one of two mechanisms: either a classical linear resonance of
harmonic oscillator, or entrainment and phase locking of nonlinear limit cycle
oscillators subjected to periodic forcing. Here, we discover a nonlinear
mechanism, which does not require intrinsic oscillations. Instead, the resonant
frequency dependence arises from coupling between an excitable and a monostable
region of the medium. This composite system is endowed with emergent
bistability between a stable steady state and stable spatiotemporal
oscillations. The resonant transition from stable state to oscillatory state is
induced by waves of particular frequency travelling through the medium. This
transition to the spatiotemporal oscillatory state requires accumulation of
multiple waves, resulting in the exclusion of lower frequencies. The cutting
off of high frequencies is realized by damping of wave amplitude in the
monostable zone and then by activating amplitude sensitive dynamics in the
monostable units. We demonstrate this new resonance mechanism in a simplistic
reaction-diffusion model. Also, we reveal this collective resonance mechanism
in in-vitro experiments and detailed biophysical simulations representing a
major type of arrhythmia. We further demonstrate, both experimentally and
theoretically, that the ongoing spatiotemporal oscillations, such as ectopic
activity in cardiac tissue, can be stopped by travelling waves of high
frequency. Overall, we claim the universality of this resonance mechanism in a
broad class of nonlinear biophysical systems. Specifically, we hypothesize that
such phenomena could be found in neuronal systems as an alternative to
traditional resonant processes.

Schwarzschild, Milne, Eddington and others on radiative transfer in stars.
There the scattering is isotropic or nearly so. It has been difficult to extend
traditional methods to highly anisotropic scattering, like that of sunlight in
Earth's clouds. The $2n$-stream method described here is a practical way to
handle highly anisotropic, conservative scattering. The basic ideas of the
$2n$-stream method are an extension of Wick's seminal work on transport of
thermal neutrons by isotropic scattering to scattering with arbitrary
anisotropy. How to do this for finite absorption and $\tilde\omega<1$ was
described in our previous paper (arXiv:2205.09713v2). But those methods fail
for conservative scattering, when $\tilde \omega = 1$. Here we show that minor

with top-down non-conformal holographic thermal duals at intermediate coupling,
has been entirely unexplored in the literature. We fill this gap in the context
of a doubly holographic setup relevant to the M-theory dual of thermal QCD-like
theories at $T>T_c$ at intermediate coupling. Remarkably, excluding the higher
derivative terms, the entanglement entropy(EE) of the Hawking radiation from
the on-shell Wald EE (for appropriate choices of constants of integration
appearing in the embeddings) increases almost linearly with the boundary time
due to dominance of EE contribution from the Hartman-Maldacena(HM)-like surface
$S_{EE}^{HM, \beta^0}, \beta\sim l_p^6$. Curiously, this imparts a
""Swiss-Cheese"" structure to the surface $S_{EE}^{HM, \beta^0}$ at a given time
(less than the Page time $t_{P}$), in $\mathbb{R}_{\geq0} \times \mathbb{C}$
effecting what could be dubbed as a ""Large N Scenario"" (LNS). Then, after
$t_{P}$, the EE contribution from the Island Surface (IS) $S_{EE}^{IS,
\beta^0}$ dominates and saturates the linear time growth of the EE of Hawking
radiation and leads to the Page curve. Requiring $S_{EE}^{IS,
\beta^0}/S_{BH}\sim2$ up to LO in the non-conformal analog of ""$c
G_N^{(11)}/r_h^9$"", and positivity of $t_{P}$, set respectively a lower and
upper bound on the horizon radius $r_h$ (the non-extremality parameter). With
the inclusion of the $O(R^4)$ terms in M theory, the turning point associated
with the HM-like surface/IS being in the deep IR, results in a relationship
between $l_p$ and $r_h$ along with a conjectural $e^{-{\cal O}(1)
N^{1/3}}$-suppression (motivated by $S_{EE}^{IS, \beta^0}/S_{BH}\sim2$). We
obtain a hierarchy with respect to this N-dependent exponential in $S_{EE}^{HM,

S_{EE}^{HM, \beta} (O(\beta))$.

interactions among nodes, where each hyperedge can connect any number of nodes.
Different from most existing studies which leverage statistical dependencies,
we study hypergraphs from the perspective of causality. Specifically, in this
paper, we focus on the problem of individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation
on hypergraphs, aiming to estimate how much an intervention (e.g., wearing face
covering) would causally affect an outcome (e.g., COVID-19 infection) of each
individual node. Existing works on ITE estimation either assume that the
outcome on one individual should not be influenced by the treatment assignments
on other individuals (i.e., no interference), or assume the interference only
exists between pairs of connected individuals in an ordinary graph. We argue
that these assumptions can be unrealistic on real-world hypergraphs, where
higher-order interference can affect the ultimate ITE estimations due to the
presence of group interactions. In this work, we investigate high-order
interference modeling, and propose a new causality learning framework powered
by hypergraph neural networks. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs
verify the superiority of our framework over existing baselines.

treatments and inducing disease-causing mechanisms. Multi-omics data
integration is attracting widespread interest in cancer research for providing

Many works, however, are limited because of the high dimensionality and
heterogeneity of multi-omics data. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
integrate multi-omics data for cancer survival prediction, called Stacked
AutoEncoder-based Survival Prediction Neural Network (SAEsurv-net). In the
cancer survival prediction for TCGA cases, SAEsurv-net addresses the curse of
dimensionality with a two-stage dimensionality reduction strategy and handles
multi-omics heterogeneity with a stacked autoencoder model. The two-stage
dimensionality reduction strategy achieves a balance between computation
complexity and information exploiting. The stacked autoencoder model removes
most heterogeneities such as data's type and size in the first group of
autoencoders, and integrates multiple omics data in the second autoencoder. The
experiments show that SAEsurv-net outperforms models based on a single type of

Automata (CA) Model. The GCA model consists of a collection of cells which
change their states depending on the states of their neighbors, like in the
classical CA model. In generalization of the CA model, the neighbors are no
longer fixed and local, they are variable and global. In the basic GCA model, a
cell is structured into a data part and a pointer part. The pointer part
consists of several pointers that hold addresses to global neighbors. The data
rule defines the new data state, and the pointer rule define the new pointer
states. The cell's state is synchronously or asynchronously updated using the
new data and new pointer states. Thereby the global neighbors can be changed
from generation to generation. Similar to the CA model, only the own cell's
state is modified. Thereby write conflicts cannot occur, all cells can work in
parallel which makes it a massively parallel model. The GCA model is related to
the CROW (concurrent read owners write) model, a specific PRAM (parallel random
access machine) model. Therefore many of the well-studied PRAM algorithms can
be transformed into GCA algorithms. Moreover, the GCA model allows to describe
a large number of data parallel applications in a suitable way. The GCA model
can easily be implemented in software, efficiently interpreted on standard
parallel architectures, and synthesized / configured into special hardware
target architectures. This article reviews the model, applications, and

exploiting inherent similarity across tracking scenes, attributed to common

online behavioral advertising. This sharing can be facilitated through a
variety of processes, including those not observable to the user's browser. The
unobservability of these processes limits the ability of researchers and
auditors seeking to verify compliance with regulations which require complete
disclosure of data sharing partners. Unfortunately, the applicability of
existing techniques to make inferences about unobservable data sharing
relationships is limited due to their dependence on protocol- or case-specific
artifacts of the online behavioral advertising ecosystem (e.g., they work only
when client-side header bidding is used for ad delivery or when advertisers
perform ad retargeting). As behavioral advertising technologies continue to
evolve rapidly, the availability of these artifacts and the effectiveness of
transparency solutions dependent on them remain ephemeral. In this paper, we
propose a generalizable technique, called ATOM, to infer data sharing
relationships between online trackers and advertisers. ATOM is different from
prior work in that it is universally applicable -- i.e., independent of ad
delivery protocols or availability of artifacts. ATOM leverages the insight
that by the very nature of behavioral advertising, ad creatives themselves can
be used to infer data sharing between trackers and advertisers -- after all,
the topics and brands showcased in an ad are dependent on the data available to
the advertiser. Therefore, by selectively blocking trackers and monitoring
changes in the characteristics of ads delivered by advertisers, ATOM is able to
identify data sharing relationships between trackers and advertisers. The
relationships discovered by our implementation of ATOM include those not found
using prior approaches and are validated by external sources.

adaptation method, called Test-time Adaptation via Self-Training with nearest
neighbor information (TAST), which is composed of the following procedures: (1)
adds trainable adaptation modules on top of the trained feature extractor; (2)
newly defines a pseudo-label distribution for the test data by using the
nearest neighbor information; (3) trains these modules only a few times during
test time to match the nearest neighbor-based pseudo label distribution and a
prototype-based class distribution for the test data; and (4) predicts the
label of test data using the average predicted class distribution from these
modules. The pseudo-label generation is based on the basic intuition that a
test data and its nearest neighbor in the embedding space are likely to share
the same label under the domain shift. By utilizing multiple randomly
initialized adaptation modules, TAST extracts useful information for the
classification of the test data under the domain shift, using the nearest
neighbor information. TAST showed better performance than the state-of-the-art
TTA methods on two standard benchmark tasks, domain generalization, namely
VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita, and image corruption, particularly
CIFAR-10/100C.

access our data across datacenters and handheld devices. Unfortunately, scaling
technology can have a significant environmental impact. Across the globe, most
semiconductor manufacturing use electricity that is generated from coal and
natural gas. For instance, manufacturing a Gigabyte of Flash emits 0.16 Kg
CO$_2$ and is a significant fraction of the total carbon emission in the
system. We estimate that manufacturing storage devices has resulted in 20
million metric tonnes of CO$_2$ emissions in 2021 alone. To better understand
this concern, this paper compares the sustainability trade-offs between Hard
Disk Drives (HDDs) and SSDs and recommends methodologies to estimate the
embodied carbon costs of the storage system. In this paper, we outline four
possible strategies to make storage systems sustainable. First, this paper
recommends directions that help select the right medium of storage (SSD vs
HDD). Second, this paper proposes lifetime extension techniques for SSDs.
Third, this paper advocates for effective and efficient recycling and reuse of
high-density multi-level cell-based SSDs. Fourth, specifically for hand-held
devices, this paper recommends leveraging elasticity in cloud storage.

  Control and Nonlinear Stability of Training Algorithm",,,,,"cs.LG math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As it stands, a robust mathematical framework to analyse and study various
topics in deep learning is yet to come to the fore. Nonetheless, viewing deep
learning as a dynamical system allows the use of established theories to
investigate the behaviour of deep neural networks. In order to study the
stability of the training process, in this article, we formulate training of
deep neural networks as a hydrodynamics system, which has a multisymplectic
structure. For that, the deep neural network is modelled using a stochastic
differential equation and, thereby, mean-field type control is used to train
it. The necessary conditions for optimality of the mean--field type control
reduce to a system of Euler-Poincare equations, which has the a similar
geometric structure to that of compressible fluids. The mean-field type control
is solved numerically using a multisymplectic numerical scheme that takes
advantage of the underlying geometry. Moreover, the numerical scheme, yields an
approximated solution which is also an exact solution of a hydrodynamics system
with a multisymplectic structure and it can be analysed using backward error
analysis. Further, nonlinear stability yields the condition for selecting the
number of hidden layers and the number of nodes per layer, that makes the
training stable while approximating the solution of a residual neural network
with a number of hidden layers approaching infinity.

vaccination at ecological level, which has been established through clinical
trials and other investigations at the individual level. We conducted an
exploratory, correlational, country-level analysis of open data centralized by
Our World in Data concerning the cumulative COVID-19 mortality for the winter
wave of the pandemic as function of the vaccination rate in October 2021. In
order to disentangle the protective relationship from confounding processes, we
controlled variables that capture country-level social development and level of
testing. We also deployed three segmentation tactics, distinguishing among
countries based on their level of COVID-19 testing, age structure, and types of
vaccines used. Controlling for confounding factors did not highlight a
statistically significant global relationship between vaccination and
cumulative mortality in the total country sample. As suggested by previous
estimates at country level, a strong, significant, negative relationship
between cumulative mortality and vaccination was highlighted through
segmentation analysis for countries positioned at the higher end of the social
development spectrum. The strongest estimate for vaccine effectiveness at
ecological level was obtained for countries that use Western-only vaccines.
This may partly reflect the higher effectiveness of Western vaccines in
comparison with the average of all vaccines in use; it may also derive from the
lower social heterogeneity of countries included in this segment. COVID-19
testing has a significant and positive relationship with cumulative mortality
for all subsamples. This indicates that testing intensity should be controlled
as a potential confounder in future ecological analyses of COVID-19 mortality.

  order closure models of nonlinear spatiotemporal transport systems",,,,,"cs.LG math.DS physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A central challenge in the computational modeling and simulation of a
multitude of science applications is to achieve robust and accurate closures
for their coarse-grained representations due to underlying highly nonlinear
multiscale interactions. These closure models are common in many nonlinear
spatiotemporal systems to account for losses due to reduced order
representations, including many transport phenomena in fluids. Previous
data-driven closure modeling efforts have mostly focused on supervised learning
approaches using high fidelity simulation data. On the other hand,
reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful yet relatively uncharted method in
spatiotemporally extended systems. In this study, we put forth a modular
dynamic closure modeling and discovery framework to stabilize the Galerkin
projection based reduced order models that may arise in many nonlinear
spatiotemporal dynamical systems with quadratic nonlinearity. However, a key
element in creating a robust RL agent is to introduce a feasible reward
function, which can be constituted of any difference metrics between the RL
model and high fidelity simulation data. First, we introduce a multi-modal RL
(MMRL) to discover mode-dependant closure policies that utilize the high
fidelity data in rewarding our RL agent. We then formulate a variational
multiscale RL (VMRL) approach to discover closure models without requiring
access to the high fidelity data in designing the reward function.
Specifically, our chief innovation is to leverage variational multiscale
formalism to quantify the difference between modal interactions in Galerkin
systems. Our results in simulating the viscous Burgers equation indicate that
the proposed VMRL method leads to robust and accurate closure
parameterizations, and it may potentially be used to discover scale-aware
closure models for complex dynamical systems.

neither. We introduce supervised and unsupervised approaches to differentiating
these questions. Our best model, a supervised RoBERTa model fine-tuned on our

with positive educational outcomes, including math instruction quality and
student achievement, showing the model's potential for use in automated teacher

environment. Using this observation as inspiration, we utilize a type of
embodied agent that exhibits layered representational capacity: meta-brain
models. Meta-brains are used to demonstrate how phenotypes process information
and exhibit self-regulation from development to maturity. We focus on two
candidate structures that potentially explain this capacity: folding and
layering. As layering and folding can be observed in a host of biological
contexts, they form the basis for our representational investigations. First,
an innate starting point (genomic encoding) is described. The generative output
of this encoding is a differentiation tree, which results in a layered
phenotypic representation. Then we specify a formal meta-brain model of the
gut, which exhibits folding and layering in development in addition to
different degrees of representation of processed information. This organ
topology is retained in maturity, with the potential for additional folding and
representational drift in response to inflammation. Next, we consider
topological remapping using the developmental Braitenberg Vehicle (dBV) as a
toy model. During topological remapping, it is shown that folding of a layered
neural network can introduce a number of distortions to the original model,
some with functional implications. The paper concludes with a discussion on how
the meta-brains method can assist us in the investigation of enactivism,
holism, and cognitive processing in the context of biological simulation.
