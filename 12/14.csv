applications due to its robustness and flexibility. We consider the scenario of
learning the conditional quantiles of a specific target population when the
available data may go beyond the target and be supplemented from other sources
that possibly share similarities with the target. A crucial question is how to
properly distinguish and utilize useful information from other sources to
improve the quantile estimation and inference at the target. We develop
transfer learning methods for high-dimensional quantile regression by detecting
informative sources whose models are similar to the target and utilizing them
to improve the target model. We show that under reasonable conditions, the
detection of the informative sources based on sample splitting is consistent.
Compared to the naive estimator with only the target data, the transfer
learning estimator achieves a much lower error rate as a function of the sample
sizes, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the similarity measures among the target
and the source models. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superiority
of our proposed approach. We apply our methods to tackle the problem of

protective mask integrity during deep fused silica wet etching is a big

one grayscale photolithography step. First, we provide a deep comprehensive
analysis of a fused quartz dissolution mechanism in BOE solution and calculate
the main fluoride fractions like $HF^-_2$, $F^-$, $(HF)_2$ components in a BOE
solution as a function of pH and $NH_4F:HF$ ratio at room temperature. Then, we
experimentally investigate the influence of BOE concentration ($NH_4F:HF$ from
1:1 to 14:1) on the mask resistance, etch rate and profile isotropy during
fused silica 60 minutes etching through a metal/photoresist mask. Finally, we
demonstrate a high-quality multilevel over-200 um isotropic wet etching process
with the rate up to 3 um/min, which could be of a great interest for advanced
fused silica microdevices with flexure suspensions, inertial masses,

Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical objects that are considered a

previous FRB analyses have solely used track events. This search utilizes seven
years of IceCube's cascade events which are statistically independent of the
track events. This event selection allows probing of a longer range of extended
timescales due to the low background rate. No statistically significant
clustering of neutrinos was observed. Upper limits are set on the
time-integrated neutrino flux emitted by FRBs for a range of extended

target for LISA space mission. While the individual masses of a BBH merger are
redshifted, the mass ratio of BBH mergers is independent of their redshift.
Therefore, if there is an independent correlation between the mass ratio and
redshift, such a relationship can be used to i) infer the redshift of the
merging binaries, and together with the luminosity distance measurement
($D_L$), constrain the expansion rate of the universe at high redshifts $H(z)$,
and ii) constrain models of supermassive black hole seed formation in the
universe assuming a fixed cosmology. We discuss why there is an expected
relation between the mass ratio of the massive BBHs with their redshift and
show the clues for this relation by analyzing cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations of BBH mergers. This approach opens up the possibility of directly
measuring the expansion rate at redshift $z \approx 2$ with LISA for the first
time. Moreover, we discover a trend between seed mass and mass ratio of massive
BBHs which by itself is a major result that could be exploited to constrain the
formation scenarios of supermassive BH seeds.

on the observation that on many medical imaging tasks text tokens should only
describe a small number of image regions and, likewise, each image region
should correspond to only a few text tokens. In CLIP-style models, this implies
that text-token embeddings should have high similarity to only a small number

achieving the desired effect. We demonstrate the promise of our approach in an

jointly attended by the test example using a rescaled attention mechanism. So
we can scale the number of exemplars with linear complexity instead of
quadratic complexity with respect to length. Experimental results on a diverse

complicated multimode resonators, such as the near-confocal optical
Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity, can provide intracavity atomic imaging in addition to
high cooperativity. This capability has recently proved important for exploring
quantum many-body physics in the driven-dissipative setting. In this work, we
show that a confocal cavity QED microscope can realize cooperativity in excess
of 110. This cooperativity is on par with the very best single-mode cavities
(which are far shorter) and 21$\times$ greater than single-mode resonators of
similar length and mirror radii. The 1.7-$\mu$m imaging resolution is naturally
identical to the photon-mediated interaction range. We measure these quantities
by determining the threshold of cavity superradiance when small, optically
tweezed Bose-Einstein condensates are pumped at various intracavity locations.
Transmission measurements of an ex situ cavity corroborate these results. We
provide a theoretical description that shows how cooperativity enhancement

stable and unstable manifolds of the traveling wave differential equation.
However, a re-scaling of the dependent variable leads to a lack of

heterodyne detection) have found increased attention in the terahertz (THz)
frequency range. However, holographic techniques rely on the use of a reference
beam in order to obtain phase information. This letter investigates the
potential of reference-free THz holographic imaging and proposes novel
supervised and unsupervised deep learning (DL) methods for amplitude and phase
recovery. The calculations incorporate Fresnel diffraction as prior knowledge.
We first show that our unsupervised dual network can predict amplitude and
phase simultaneously, thus overcoming the limitation of previous studies which
could only predict phase objects. This is demonstrated with synthetic 2D image
data as well as with measured 2D THz diffraction images. The advantage of
unsupervised DL is that it can be used directly without labeling by human
experts. We then address supervised DL -- a concept of general applicability.
We introduce training with a database set of 2D images taken in the visible
spectra range and modified by us numerically to emulate THz images. With this
approach, we avoid the prohibitively time-consuming collection of a large
number of THz-frequency images. The results obtained with both approaches
represent the first steps towards fast holographic THz imaging with
reference-beam-free low-cost power detection.

brain activity to infer mental states or internal representations of perceptual

relies on semantic and contextual similarity. We employ an fMRI dataset of
natural image vision and create a deep learning decoding pipeline inspired by
the existence of both bottom-up and top-down processes in human vision. We
train a linear brain-to-feature model to map fMRI activity features to visual
stimuli features, assuming that the brain projects visual information onto a
space that is homeomorphic to the latent space represented by the last
convolutional layer of a pretrained convolutional neural network, which
typically collects a variety of semantic features that summarize and highlight
similarities and differences between concepts. These features are then
categorized in the latent space using a nearest-neighbor strategy, and the
results are used to condition a generative latent diffusion model to create
novel images. From fMRI data only, we produce reconstructions of visual stimuli
that match the original content very well on a semantic level, surpassing the
state of the art in previous literature. We evaluate our work and obtain good
results using a quantitative semantic metric (the Wu-Palmer similarity metric

computer vision, yet we understand very little about why they work and what
they learn. While existing studies visually analyze the mechanisms of
convolutional neural networks, an analogous exploration of ViTs remains
challenging. In this paper, we first address the obstacles to performing
visualizations on ViTs. Assisted by these solutions, we observe that neurons in
ViTs trained with language model supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by
semantic concepts rather than visual features. We also explore the underlying
differences between ViTs and CNNs, and we find that transformers detect image
background features, just like their convolutional counterparts, but their
predictions depend far less on high-frequency information. On the other hand,
both architecture types behave similarly in the way features progress from
abstract patterns in early layers to concrete objects in late layers. In
addition, we show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except
the final layer. In contrast to previous works, we show that the last layer
most likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global
pooling operation. Finally, we conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide

This class is an analogue of a class known in RR Lyrae stars. Hundreds of other
signals were detected that cannot be attributed to radial modes or the

model where the dependence between the marginal densities is modeled using the

estimate all of the components of this model under a location-scale constraint
on the marginals. Here, we introduce a deterministic algorithm that seeks to
maximize a smoothed semiparametric likelihood. No location-scale assumption is
made about the marginals. The algorithm is monotonic in one special case, and,
in another, leads to ``approximate monotonicity'' -- whereby the difference
between successive values of the objective function becomes non-negative up to
an additive term that becomes negligible after a sufficiently large number of
iterations. The behavior of this algorithm is illustrated on several simulated

the original $\phi^{2}$ chaotic inflation model. We investigate the
compatibility of this model with the observed CMB when treated as an effective
theory of inflation in quantum gravity by examining the constraints on the
model parameters arising due to Planck-suppressed potential corrections and
reheating. Additionally, we consider two possible reheating channels and assess
their viability in relation to the constraints on the size of the coupling to
the $R^{2}$ term. We present an application of the Affleck-Dine mechanism, in
which quadratic $B$-violating potential terms generate the asymmetry, with a
complex inflaton as the Affleck-Dine field. We derive the $B$ asymmetry
generated in the inflaton condensate analytically and numerically. We use the
present-day asymmetry to constrain the size of the $B$-violating mass term and
derive an upper bound on the inflaton mass in order for the Affleck-Dine
dynamics to be compatible with non-minimally coupled inflation in the metric

inflatonic Q-balls in a non-minimally coupled Palatini inflation model, through
an analytical derivation of the Q-ball equation and numerical confirmation of
the existence of solutions, and derive a range of the inflaton mass squared
within which the model can inflate and produce Q-balls. We derive analytical
estimates of the properties of these Q-balls, explore the effects of curvature,
and discuss observational signatures of the model.

However, as recommender systems become ubiquitous in our society, recent years
have also witnessed significant fairness concerns for recommender systems.
Specifically, studies have shown that recommender systems may inherit or even
amplify biases from historical data, and as a result, provide unfair
recommendations. To address fairness risks in recommender systems, most of the
previous approaches to date are focused on modifying either the existing
training data samples or the deployed recommender algorithms, but unfortunately
with limited degrees of success. In this paper, we propose a new approach
called fair recommendation with optimized antidote data (FairRoad), which aims
to improve the fairness performances of recommender systems through the
construction of a small and carefully crafted antidote dataset. Toward this
end, we formulate our antidote data generation task as a mathematical
optimization problem, which minimizes the unfairness of the targeted
recommender systems while not disrupting the deployed recommendation
algorithms. Extensive experiments show that our proposed antidote data
generation algorithm significantly improve the fairness of recommender systems
with a small amounts of antidote data.

binning choice for the lens sample of galaxies. We divide the CosmoDC2 and
Buzzard simulated galaxy catalogs into a training set and an application set,
where the training set is non-representative in a realistic way, and then
estimate photometric redshifts for the application sets. The galaxies are
sorted into redshift bins covering equal intervals of redshift or comoving
distance, or with an equal number of galaxies in each bin, and we consider a
generalized extension of these approaches. We find that placing equal numbers
of galaxies in each bin produces the highest signal to noise of the initial
binning choices, but that the choice of bin edges can be further optimized. We
then train a neural network classifier to identify galaxies that are either
highly likely to have accurate photometric redshift estimates, or highly likely
to be sorted into the correct redshift bin. The neural network classifier is
used to remove poor redshift estimates from the sample, and the results are
compared to the case when none of the sample is removed. We find that the
choice of bin edges has a larger impact than the sample selection with the
NNCs, but the NNCs are able to recover ~70% of the loss in signal to noise that
occurs when a non-representative training sample is used.

class of exploration sets, called exit sets, which are naturally associated
with a 2D vector-valued GFF : $\phi : Z^2 \to R^N, N\geq 1$. We prove that,
somewhat surprisingly, these sets are a.s. degenerate as long as $N\geq 2$,
while they are conjectured to be macroscopic and fractal when $N=1$.
  This analysis allows us, when $N\geq 2$, to understand the percolation
properties of the level sets of $\{\|\phi(x)\|, x\in Z^2\}$ and leads us to our
second main motivation in this work: if one projects a spin $O(N+1)$ model
(classical Heisenberg model is $N=2$) down to a spin $O(N)$ model, we end up
with a spin $O(N)$ in a quenched disorder given by random conductances on
$Z^2$. Using the exit sets of the $N$-vector-valued GFF, we obtain a local and
geometric description of this random disorder in the limit $\beta\to \infty$.
This allows us to revisit a series of celebrated works by Patrascioiu and
Seiler ([PS92, PS93, PS02]) which argued against Polyakov's prediction that
spin $O(N+1)$ model is massive at all temperatures when $N\geq 2$ ([Pol75]). We
make part of their arguments rigorous and more importantly we provide the
following counter-example: we build ergodic environments of (arbitrary) high
conductances with (arbitrary) small and disconnected regions of low
conductances in which, despite the predominance of high conductances, the $XY$
model remains massive.
  Of independent interest, we prove that at high $\beta$, the transverse
fluctuations of a classical Heisenberg model are given by a $N=2$ vectorial
GFF. This is implicit in [Pol75] but we give here the first (non-trivial)
rigorous proof. Also, independently of the recent work [DF22], we show that
two-point correlation functions of the spin $O(N)$ model are given in terms of
certain percolation events in the cable graph for any $N\geq 1$.

the orbit. The CE can lead to mergers or to a subsequent phase of interactions.
Mergers may involve any combination of two compact objects and/or stars. Some
involving white dwarfs, may produce Type Ia supernovae, while merging neutron
stars may yield gamma-ray bursts, and merging compact objects of all kinds
produce gravitational radiation. Since CEs can arise from a variety of

tunneling, has been proposed in quantum gravity, which enhances the decay rate
of a meta-stable vacuum by many orders of magnitude. In this paper, we present
path integral formalism that is applicable to such systems. The formalism can
be directly extended to quantum gravity and has some implications on the
problem of time in quantum gravity. We also discuss a possible relation to the

Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoders, named as I2P-MAE. By self-supervised
pre-training, we leverage the well learned 2D knowledge to guide 3D masked
autoencoding, which reconstructs the masked point tokens with an
encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we first utilize off-the-shelf 2D
models to extract the multi-view visual features of the input point cloud, and
then conduct two types of image-to-point learning schemes on top. For one, we
introduce a 2D-guided masking strategy that maintains semantically important
point tokens to be visible for the encoder. Compared to random masking, the
network can better concentrate on significant 3D structures and recover the
masked tokens from key spatial cues. For another, we enforce these visible
tokens to reconstruct the corresponding multi-view 2D features after the
decoder. This enables the network to effectively inherit high-level 2D
semantics learned from rich image data for discriminative 3D modeling. Aided by
our image-to-point pre-training, the frozen I2P-MAE, without any fine-tuning,
achieves 93.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, competitive to the fully
trained results of existing methods. By further fine-tuning on on
ScanObjectNN's hardest split, I2P-MAE attains the state-of-the-art 90.11%

combination of continuum frameworks, numerical analyses and all-atom

tune their surface morphology and rotation extent in response to external
strains. Compression favors rotation to and growth of low energy GB phases
(complexions) at eGB valleys while tension favors the transitions at eGB
ridges, a reflection of the stress-induced mass efflux/influx that changes the
energetic balance between interfacial and deformation energies. Molecular
dynamics simulations of strained and growing bicrystal films reveal that the
eGB phase transition is coupled to island formation at the surface triple

and structural changes arise from the large strains that can be induced in
these layered materials by non-hydrostatic stresses. The pressure-volume
equations of state (EOS) measured under these quasi-hydrostatic conditions
cannot be fit to single phenomenological formulation over the pressure ranges

the sensitivity of $Bi_2Sr_2Ca_{n-1}Cu_nO_{2n+4+\delta}$ to deviatoric stresses
provides explanations for the numerous inconsistencies in reported EOS

behavior of all three compositions is a manifestation of the changes in
electronic properties that are also responsible for the remarkable
non-monotonic dependence of $\mathit{T_c}$ with pressure, including the
increase in $\mathit{T_c}$ at the highest pressures studied so far for each.

nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general

tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained
details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information
between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the
way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group
Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block,
features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group
tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged
between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated
grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer
decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including
image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance
segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous
works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution

semiconducting molecules, PTCDI and PTCDA, which possess similar bandgaps and
ionization potentials but form different lattice structures on MoS2, are
investigated.The PTCDI lattice on MoS2 is distorted geometrically, which lifts
the degeneracy of the two molecules within the crystal's unit cell. The
degeneracy lifting results in a spatial variation of the molecular orbital
energy, with an amplitude and periodicity of ~ 0.2 eV and ~ 2 nm, respectively.
On the other hand, no such energy variation is observed in PTCDA/MoS2, where
the PTCDA lattice is much less distorted. The periodic variation in molecular
orbital energies provides effective trapping sites for IXs. For IXs formed at
PTCDI/MoS2, rapid spatial localization of the electron in the organic layer
towards the interface is observed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of these

efficient operation of Smart Grids. The automated design of such accurate
forecasting models for individual PV plants includes two challenges: First,
information about the PV mounting configuration (i.e. inclination and azimuth
angles) is often missing. Second, for new PV plants, the amount of historical
data available to train a forecasting model is limited (cold-start problem). We
address these two challenges by proposing a new method for day-ahead PV power
generation forecasts called AutoPV. AutoPV is a weighted ensemble of
forecasting models that represent different PV mounting configurations. This
representation is achieved by pre-training each forecasting model on a separate
PV plant and by scaling the model's output with the peak power rating of the
corresponding PV plant. To tackle the cold-start problem, we initially weight
each forecasting model in the ensemble equally. To tackle the problem of
missing information about the PV mounting configuration, we use new data that
become available during operation to adapt the ensemble weights to minimize the
forecasting error. AutoPV is advantageous as the unknown PV mounting
configuration is implicitly reflected in the ensemble weights, and only the PV
plant's peak power rating is required to re-scale the ensemble's output. AutoPV
also allows to represent PV plants with panels distributed on different roofs
with varying alignments, as these mounting configurations can be reflected
proportionally in the weighting. Additionally, the required computing memory is
decoupled when scaling AutoPV to hundreds of PV plants, which is beneficial in
Smart Grids with limited computing capabilities. For a real-world data set with
11 PV plants, the accuracy of AutoPV is comparable to a model trained on two
years of data and outperforms an incrementally trained model.

symmetry between fermions and bosons. Experimental data imply that supergravity
must be broken. Among several mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking, gravity
mediated supersymmetry breaking is central in this thesis. These mechanisms
have the main feature to generate the so-called soft SUSY breaking terms.
Recently, new solutions have been identified, leading to the usual soft
breaking terms together with additional hard breaking terms. These new
solutions are characterized by a new singlet chiral superfield with a
non-standard behaviour.
  Along the line of these new solutions, two models with two singlet fields
were identified: one leading to hard breaking terms called S2MSSM and one with
only soft breaking terms called N2MSSM. In the S2MSSM, we study the effects of
the hard breaking terms on the Higgs boson mass through radiative corrections.
A comparison between the N2MSSM and the NMSSM through the fine-tuning of the

cosmological horizon, which opens up new opportunities for testing the
cosmological concordance model to high accuracy. In particular, constraints on
the squeezed bispectrum could rule out the single-field hypothesis during
inflation. However, the squeezed bispectrum is also sensitive to dynamical
effects of general relativity as well as interactions of matter with residual
radiation from the early Universe. In this paper, we present a relativistic
simulation pipeline that includes these relativistic effects consistently. We
produce light cones and calculate the observed number counts of cold dark
matter for five redshift bins between $z=0.55$-$2.25$. We compare the
relativistic results against reference Newtonian simulations by means of
angular power- and bispectra. We find that the dynamical relativistic effects
scale roughly inversely proportional to the multipole in the angular power
spectrum, with an amplitude of $0.5\%$ to $5\%$ of the total power. By using a
smoothing method applied to the binned bispectrum we detect the Newtonian
bispectrum with very high significance. The purely relativistic part of the
matter bispectrum, obtained by subtracting the Newtonian bispectrum from the
relativistic one, is detected with a significance of $\sim 3\,\sigma$, mostly
limited by cosmic variance. Our relativistic pipeline for modelling ultra-large
scales yields gauge-independent results as we compute observables consistently
on the past light cone, while the Newtonian treatment employs approximations
that leave some residual gauge dependence. A gauge-invariant approach is
required in order to meet the expected level of precision of forthcoming probes
of cosmic structures on ultra-large scales.

argument relies on a map from the $q$-Whittaker measure to a model of periodic
last passage percolation (LPP) with geometric weights in an infinite strip that
was recently established in [arXiv:2106.11922]. By a path routing argument we
bound the passage time in the periodic environment in terms of an infinite sum
of independent passage times for standard LPP on $N\times N$ squares with
geometric weights whose parameters decay geometrically. To prove our tail bound

uniformly over all $N \in \mathbb N$ and all the geometric parameters in

Furthermore, firms can find the stable network via iterative pairwise

under realistic settings, a regulator cannot pin down the changed beliefs that
caused the network changes. Also, each firm can use its view of the network to
inform its beliefs. For instance, it can detect outlier firms whose beliefs
deviate from their peers. But it cannot identify the deviant belief: increased

white dwarf stars in binaries, has recently undergone a major paradigm shift.
Though the bolometric luminosity of novae was long thought to arise directly
from photons supplied by the thermonuclear runaway, recent GeV gamma-ray
observations have supported the notion that a significant portion of the
luminosity could come from radiative shocks. More recently, observations of
novae have lent evidence that these shocks are acceleration sites for hadrons
for at least some types of novae. In this scenario, a flux of neutrinos may
accompany the observed gamma rays. As the gamma rays from most novae have only
been observed up to a few GeV, novae have previously not been considered as
targets for neutrino telescopes, which are most sensitive at and above TeV
energies. Here, we present the first search for neutrinos from novae with
energies between a few GeV and 10 TeV using IceCube-DeepCore, a densely
instrumented region of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with a reduced energy
threshold. We search both for a correlation between gamma-ray and neutrino
emission as well as between optical and neutrino emission from novae. We find
no evidence for neutrino emission from the novae considered in this analysis
and set upper limits for all gamma-ray detected novae.

source of long-period comets (LPCs) implanted from the outer Solar System
during the time of giant planet formation. The abundance of rocky ice-free
bodies is a key diagnostic of Solar System formation models as it can
distinguish between ``massive"" and ``depleted"" proto-asteroid belt scenarios
and thus disentangle competing planet formation models. Here we report a direct
observation of a decimeter-sized ($\sim2$ kg) rocky meteoroid on a retrograde
LPC orbit ($e \approx 1.0$, i = $121^{\circ}$). During its flight, it
fragmented at dynamic pressures similar to fireballs dropping ordinary
chondrite meteorites. A numerical ablation model fit produces bulk density and
ablation properties also consistent with asteroidal meteoroids. We estimate the
flux of rocky objects impacting Earth from the Oort cloud to be
$1.08^{+2.81}_{-0.95} \mathrm{meteoroids/10^6 km^2/yr}$ to a mass limit of 10
g. This corresponds to an abundance of rocky meteoroids of $\sim6^{+13}_{-5}$\%
of all objects originating in the Oort cloud and impacting Earth to these
masses. Our result gives support to migration-based dynamical models of the
formation of the Solar System which predict that significant rocky material is
implanted in the Oort cloud, a result not explained by traditional Solar System

fragile quantum states. Recent work suggests that spatial noise correlations
can be harnessed as a resource for noise mitigation via the use of spectator
qubits to measure environmental noise. In this work we generalize this concept
from spectator qubits to a spectator mode: a photonic mode which continuously
measures spatially correlated classical dephasing noise and applies a
continuous correction drive to frequency-tunable data qubits. Our analysis
shows that by using many photon states, spectator modes can surpass many of the
quantum measurement constraints that limit spectator qubit approaches. We also
find that long-time data qubit dephasing can be arbitrarily suppressed, even
for white noise dephasing. Further, using a squeezing (parametric) drive, the
error in the spectator mode approach can exhibit Heisenberg-limited scaling in
the number of photons used. We also show that spectator mode noise mitigation
can be implemented completely autonomously using engineered dissipation. In
this case no explicit measurement or processing of a classical measurement
record is needed. Our work establishes spectator modes as a potentially
powerful alternative to spectator qubits for noise mitigation.

performance of human-AI decision-making teams: overreliance, when people agree
with an AI, even when it is incorrect. Surprisingly, overreliance does not
reduce when the AI produces explanations for its predictions, compared to only
providing predictions. Some have argued that overreliance results from
cognitive biases or uncalibrated trust, attributing overreliance to an
inevitability of human cognition. By contrast, our paper argues that people
strategically choose whether or not to engage with an AI explanation,
demonstrating empirically that there are scenarios where AI explanations reduce
overreliance. To achieve this, we formalize this strategic choice in a
cost-benefit framework, where the costs and benefits of engaging with the task
are weighed against the costs and benefits of relying on the AI. We manipulate
the costs and benefits in a maze task, where participants collaborate with a
simulated AI to find the exit of a maze. Through 5 studies (N = 731), we find
that costs such as task difficulty (Study 1), explanation difficulty (Study 2,
3), and benefits such as monetary compensation (Study 4) affect overreliance.
Finally, Study 5 adapts the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm to quantify
the utility of different explanations, providing further support for our
framework. Our results suggest that some of the null effects found in
literature could be due in part to the explanation not sufficiently reducing
the costs of verifying the AI's prediction.

outside of the nematic phase, the superconducting critical temperature reaches
a minimum before it is quickly enhanced towards 40 K above 4 GPa. The
resistivity data reveal signatures of a fan-like structure of non-Fermi liquid
behaviour which could indicate the existence of a putative quantum critical
point buried underneath the superconducting dome around 4.3 GPa. Further
increasing the pressure, the zero-field electrical resistivity develops a
non-metallic temperature dependence and the superconducting transition broadens
significantly. Eventually, the system fails to reach a fully zero-resistance
state despite a continuous finite superconducting transition temperature, and
any remaining resistance at low temperatures becomes strongly
current-dependent. Our results suggest that the high-pressure, high-$T_c$ phase
of iron chalcogenides is very fragile and sensitive to uniaxial effects of the
pressure medium, cell design and sample thickness which can trigger a
first-order transition. These high-pressure regions could be understood

understanding matters in VOS, and integrating it with memory-based matching can
enjoy the synergy, which is intuitively sensible from the definition of VOS
task, \ie, identifying and segmenting object instances within the video.
Towards this goal, we present a two-branch network for VOS, where the
query-based instance segmentation (IS) branch delves into the instance details
of the current frame and the VOS branch performs spatial-temporal matching with
the memory bank. We employ the well-learned object queries from IS branch to
inject instance-specific information into the query key, with which the
instance-augmented matching is further performed. In addition, we introduce a
multi-path fusion block to effectively combine the memory readout with
multi-scale features from the instance segmentation decoder, which incorporates
high-resolution instance-aware features to produce final segmentation results.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS 2016/2017 val (92.6%

add up information to the standard two-point statistics by breaking the
isotropy of the matter density field. A Fisher analysis based on a set of
thousands of Quijote simulations allows us to conclude that the combination of
power spectra computed in the several cosmic web environments is able to break
some degeneracies. Compared to the matter monopole and quadrupole information
alone, the combination of environment-dependent spectra tightens down the
constraints on key parameters like the matter density or the summed neutrino
mass by up to a factor of $5.5$. Additionally, while the information contained
in the matter statistic quickly saturates at mildly non-linear scales in
redshift space, the combination of power spectra in the environments appears as
a goldmine of information able to improve the constraints at all the studied
scales from $0.1$ to $0.5$ $h$/Mpc and suggests that further improvements are

remaining from such H-ingestion. CCSN models with intermediate to low energy

isotopic abundances in grains without assuming mixing with O-rich CCSN ejecta.
The most $^{28}$Si-rich grains are reproduced by energetic models when material
from the C/Si zone is mixed with surrounding C-rich material, and the observed
trends of the $^{44}$Ti/$^{48}$Ti and $^{49}$Ti/$^{48}$Ti ratios are consistent

challenges of consistency, conservation, and accuracy, especially in
multi-physics simulations where species with different 'softening laws' may
interact. We therefore derive a generalized form of the energy-and-momentum
conserving gravitational equations of motion, applicable to arbitrary rules
used to determine the force softening, together with consistent associated
timestep criteria, interaction terms between species with different softening
laws, and arbitrary maximum/minimum softenings. We also derive new methods to
maintain better accuracy and conservation when symmetrizing forces between
particles. We review and extend previously-discussed adaptive softening schemes
based on the local neighbor particle density, and present several new schemes
for scaling the softening with properties of the gravitational field, i.e. the
potential or acceleration or tidal tensor. We show that the 'tidal softening'
scheme not only represents a physically-motivated, translation and Galilean
invariant and equivalence-principle respecting (and therefore conservative)
method, but imposes negligible timestep or other computational penalties,
ensures that pairwise two-body scattering is small compared to smooth
background forces, and can resolve outstanding challenges in properly capturing
tidal disruption of substructures (minimizing artificial destruction) while
also avoiding excessive N-body heating. We make all of this public in the GIZMO
code.

spontaneously broken global symmetry $U(1)'$ and a preserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. The three-loop suppression allows the new particles to have masses at
the TeV scale without fine-tuning the Yukawa couplings. The model leads to a
rich phenomenology while satisfying all the current constraints imposed by
neutrinoless double-beta decay, charged-lepton flavor violation, and
electroweak precision observables. The relatively large Yukawa couplings lead
to sizable rates for charged lepton flavor violation processes, well within
future experimental reach. The model could also successfully explain the $W$
mass anomaly and provides viable fermionic or scalar dark matter candidates.

between galaxy structure and broad stellar population properties, at stellar
masses log(M/Msun)>10.85. We find that quiescent and star-forming cluster
galaxy populations are largely dominated by bulge- and disk-dominated sources,
respectively, with relative contributions consistent with those of field
counterparts. At the same time, the enhanced quiescent galaxy fraction observed
in these clusters with respect to the coeval field is reflected in a
significant morphology-density relation, with bulge-dominated galaxies clearly
dominating the massive galaxy population in these clusters already at z~1.5. At
face value, these observations show no significant environmental signatures in
the correlation between broad structural and stellar population properties. In
particular, the Sersic index and axis ratio distribution of massive, quiescent
sources are consistent with field counterparts, in spite of the enhanced
quiescent galaxy fraction in clusters. This consistency suggests a tight
connection between quenching and structural evolution towards a bulge-dominated
morphology, at least in the probed cluster regions and galaxy stellar mass
range, irrespective of environment-related processes affecting star formation
in cluster galaxies. We also probe the stellar mass vs. size relation of
cluster galaxies, and find that star-forming and quiescent sources populate the
mass-size plane in a manner largely similar to their field counterparts, with
no evidence of a significant size difference for any probed sub-population. In
particular, both quiescent and bulge-dominated cluster galaxies have average
sizes at fixed stellar mass consistent with their counterparts in the field.

correlations between SMBH mass and stellar mass. We therefore construct three
samples of elliptical galaxies, one at $z\sim0$ and two at $0.7\lesssim z
\lesssim2.5$, and quantify their relative positions in the $M_{BH}-M_*$ plane.
Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we find evidence for translational offsets
in both stellar mass and SMBH mass between the local sample and both higher
redshift samples. The offsets in stellar mass are small, and consistent with
measurement bias, but the offsets in SMBH mass are much larger, reaching a
factor of seven between $z\sim1$ and $z\sim0$. The magnitude of the SMBH offset
may also depend on redshift, reaching a factor of $\sim20$ at $z\sim 2$. The
result is robust against variation in the high and low redshift samples and
changes in the analysis approach. The magnitude and redshift evolution of the
offset are challenging to explain in terms of selection and measurement biases.
We conclude that either there is a physical mechanism that preferentially grows
SMBHs in elliptical galaxies at $z\lesssim 2$, or that selection and
measurement biases are both underestimated, and depend on redshift.

and destruction at the boundaries of molecular clouds; (2) determining how
quickly and by what process massive star feedback disperses molecular clouds;
and (3) determining the mechanism driving the evolution of planet-forming disks
around young solar-analog stars. Hyperion conducts this science using a
straightforward, highly-efficient, single-channel instrument design. Hyperion's
instrument consists of a 48 cm primary mirror, with an f/5 focal ratio. The
spectrometer has two modes, both covering 138.5-161.5 nm bandpasses. A low
resolution mode has a spectral resolution of R>10,000 with a slit length of 65
arcmin, while the high resolution mode has a spectral resolution of R>50,000
over a slit length of 5 armin. Hyperion occupies a 2 week long, high-earth,
Lunar resonance TESS-like orbit, and conducts 2 weeks of planned observations
per orbit, with time for downlinks and calibrations. Hyperion was reviewed as
Category I, which is the highest rating possible, but was not selected.

assumes knowledge of (i) a region of interest displaying the object in the

work are threefold. First, we present a 6D pose refiner based on a
render&compare strategy which can be applied to novel objects. The shape and
coordinate system of the novel object are provided as inputs to the network by
rendering multiple synthetic views of the object's CAD model. Second, we
introduce a novel approach for coarse pose estimation which leverages a network
trained to classify whether the pose error between a synthetic rendering and an
observed image of the same object can be corrected by the refiner. Third, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of photorealistic images of thousands
of objects with diverse visual and shape properties and show that this
diversity is crucial to obtain good generalization performance on novel
objects. We train our approach on this large synthetic dataset and apply it
without retraining to hundreds of novel objects in real images from several
pose estimation benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the ModelNet and YCB-Video datasets. An extensive evaluation on the 7 core
datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that our approach achieves
performance competitive with existing approaches that require access to the

Spatial heterogeneity is one common stabilizing mechanism, but the rate at
which organisms disperse throughout the heterogeneous environment may strongly
impact the stabilizing effect that heterogeneity can provide. An intriguing
example is the gut microbiome, where active mechanisms exist to control the
movement of microbes and potentially maintain diversity. We investigate how
biodiversity is affected by migration rate using a simple evolutionary model
with heterogeneous selection pressure. We find that the biodiversity-migration
rate relationship is shaped by multiple phase transitions, including a
reentrant phase transition to coexistence. At each transition, an ecotype goes
extinct and dynamics exhibit critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is encoded in the
statistics of fluctuations due to demographic noise -- this may provide an

(8.0\pm 4.0)\times 10^{8}\,M_\odot$ based on the luminosity and spatial extent
of [CII]. This yields an exceptionally high gas fraction, $f_{\rm gas} = M_{\rm

this modeling to variations in the model training procedure, we build an
end-to-end pipeline to test the recently developed SALT3 model. We explore the
consequences of removing pre-2000s low-$z$ or poorly calibrated $U$-band data,
adjusting the amount and fidelity of SN Ia spectra, and using a
model-independent framework to simulate the training data. We find the SALT3
model surfaces are improved by having additional spectra and $U$-band data, and
can be shifted by $\sim 5\%$ if host galaxy contamination is not sufficiently
removed from SN spectra. We find that resulting measurements of $w$ are
consistent to within $2.5\%$ for all training variants explored in this work,
with the largest shifts coming from variants that add color-dependent
calibration offsets or host galaxy contamination to the training spectra, and
those that remove pre-2000s low-$z$ data. These results demonstrate that the
SALT3 model training procedure is largely robust to reasonable variations in
the training data, but that additional attention must be paid to the treatment
of spectroscopic data in the training process. We also find that the training
procedure is sensitive to the color distributions of the input data; the
resulting $w$ measurement can be biased by $\sim2\%$ if the color distribution
is not sufficiently wide. Future low-$z$ data, particularly $u$-band
observations and high signal-to-noise ratio SN Ia spectra, will help to
significantly improve SN Ia modeling in the coming years.

structure corresponding to the standard classical rational R-matrix structure
on the dual space $L^*gl(r)$ of the loop algebra $Lgl(r)$. Nonautonomous
isomonodromic counterparts of the isospectral systems generated by spectral
invariants are obtained by identifying the deformation parameters as Casimir
functions on the phase space. These are shown to coincide with the higher
Birkhoff invariants determining the local asymptotics near to irregular
singular points, together with the pole loci. Infinitesimal isomonodromic
deformations are shown to be generated by the sum of the Hamiltonian vector
field and an explicit derivative vector field that is transversal to the
symplectic foliation. The Casimir functions serve as coordinates complementing
those along the symplectic leaves, extended by the exponents of formal
monodromy, defining a local symplectomorphism between them. The explicit
derivative vector fields preserve the Poisson structure and define a flat
transversal connection, spanning an integrable distribution whose leaves,
locally, may be identified as the orbits of a free abelian group. The
projection of the infinitesimal isomonodromic deformations vector fields to the
quotient manifold under this action gives the commuting Hamiltonian vector

the noise level tends to zero. The standard regularization technique is defined
by variational image reconstruction, which minimizes a data discrepancy
augmented by a regularizer. The actual numerical implementation makes use of
iterative methods, often involving proximal mappings of the regularizer. In
recent years, Plug-and-Play image reconstruction (PnP) has been developed as a
new powerful generalization of variational methods based on replacing proximal
mappings by more general image denoisers. While PnP iterations yield excellent
results, neither stability nor convergence in the sense of regularization has
been studied so far. In this work, we extend the idea of PnP by considering
families of PnP iterations, each being accompanied by its own denoiser. As our
main theoretical result, we show that such PnP reconstructions lead to stable

observed. Results further suggest that similarity for turbulent energy
dissipation rate depends on both $Z$ and $\zeta$. The proposed mixed scaling of
$Z$ and relevance of $h$ can be explained by physical arguments related to the
limit of z-less stratification that is reached asymptotically above the surface
layer. While the presented evidence and fitted similarity relations are
promising, the results and arguments are limited to a small sample of idealized
stationary stable boundary layers. Corroboration is needed from independent
datasets and analyses, including for complex and transient conditions not

Theoretically, it belongs to a class of structurally centrosymmetric crystals
whose layered antiferromagnetic order breaks inversion symmetry for even layer

coupling between the crystal and magnetic structures. Here, we perform magnetic
field and temperature-dependent SHG measurements on MnBi2Te4 flakes ranging

maximal social welfare with minimal instability. To maximize social welfare,
our proposed framework enhances the quality of recommendations by exploring
allocations that optimistically maximize the rewards. To minimize instability,
a measure of users' incentives to deviate from recommended allocations, the
algorithm prices the items based on a scheme derived from the Walrasian
equilibria. Though it is known that these equilibria yield stable prices for
markets with known user preferences, our approach accounts for the inherent
uncertainty in the preferences and further ensures that the users accept their
recommendations under offered prices. To the best of our knowledge, our
approach is the first to integrate techniques from combinatorial bandits,
optimal resource allocation, and collaborative filtering to obtain an algorithm
that achieves sub-linear social welfare regret as well as sub-linear
instability. Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world data also
demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy compared to approaches that do not

cardinal to enhance infrastructure resilience. Unlike traditional approaches,
this paper proposes a novel infrastructure vulnerability assessment framework
that accounts for: various types of infrastructure interdependencies including
physical, logical and geographical from a holistic perspective; lack
of/incomplete information on supply-demand flow characteristics of
interdependent infrastructure; and, unavailability/inadequate data on
infrastructure network topology and/or interdependencies. Specifically, this
paper models multi-infrastructure vulnerabilities leveraging simulation-based
hybrid approach coupled with time-dependent Bayesian network analysis while
considering cascading failures within and across CIS networks, under incomplete
information. Existing synthetic data on electricity, water and supply chain
networks are used to implement/validate the framework. Infrastructure
vulnerabilities are depicted on a geo-map using Voronoi polygons. Our results
indicate that infrastructure vulnerability is inversely proportional to the
number of redundancies inbuilt in the infrastructure system, indicating that
allocating resources to add redundancies in an existing infrastructure system
is essential to reduce its risk of failure. It is observed that higher the
initial failure rate of the components, higher is the vulnerability of the
infrastructure, highlighting the importance of modernizing and upgrading the
infrastructure system aiming to reduce the initial failure probabilities. Our
results also underline the importance of collaborative working and sharing the
necessary information among multiple infrastructure systems, aiming towards
minimizing the overall failure risk of interdependent infrastructure systems.

transport to predict surprising features in the mature field of current pumping
by magnetization dynamics in spintronics -- in the presence of spin-orbit (SO)
coupling, the pumped charge current oscillates at both the frequency $\omega_0$
of magnetization precession and high harmonics $N=\omega/\omega_0$, reaching
{\em astonishingly high} cutoff \mbox{$N_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1000$} by
increasing the SO coupling. However, results in the paper violate two basic
theorems of time-dependent quantum transport: ({\em i}) current response to
time-periodic external field {\em must be perfectly periodic} itself in the
long time limit for a two-terminal device because its active region is attached
to two semi-infinite leads bringing continuous energy spectrum; and ({\em ii})
no DC component of charge current is allowed in the left-right symmetric
two-terminal devices, or in asymmetric devices its value cannot be changed by
simply increasing the SO coupling. We illustrate these two theorems by using
completely different calculations applied to one-dimensional two-terminal

vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is
useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used
to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop
progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on
ground truth data for training/calibration. This reliance on ground survey data
confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this
study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in
unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop
progress data generated for an unsurveyed region. Corn-growing zones in
Argentina were used as surrogate 'unsurveyed' regions. Existing weather
generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to
produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. A neural
network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was
trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different
combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. A stopping criterion was developed
which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation
loss. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when
trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall
performance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data
and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was
greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed
region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI
data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be
possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data.

quasars have been discovered in the first billion years of cosmic history, with
the quasar redshift frontier extended to z~7.6. Observations of quasars at

exponentially at z>5, suggesting that the earliest quasars emerge at z~10; the
lack of strong evolution in their average spectral energy distribution
indicates a rapid buildup of the AGN environment. (2) Billion-solar-mass BHs

combination of massive early BH seeds with highly efficient and sustained

Observations of heavy element absorption lines suggest that the circumgalactic

generation (6G) wireless systems, posing unprecedented challenges in terms of
its multi-modal data transmissions with stringent latency and reliability
requirements. Towards enabling this wireless metaverse, in this article we
propose a novel semantic communication (SC) framework by decomposing the
metaverse into human/machine agent-specific semantic multiverses (SMs). An SM
stored at each agent comprises a semantic encoder and a generator, leveraging
recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI). To improve
communication efficiency, the encoder learns the semantic representations (SRs)
of multi-modal data, while the generator learns how to manipulate them for
locally rendering scenes and interactions in the metaverse. Since these learned
SMs are biased towards local environments, their success hinges on
synchronizing heterogeneous SMs in the background while communicating SRs in
the foreground, turning the wireless metaverse problem into the problem of
semantic multiverse communication (SMC). Based on this SMC architecture, we
propose several promising algorithmic and analytic tools for modeling and
designing SMC, ranging from distributed learning and multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) to signaling games and symbolic AI.

energy transitions towards the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya. We carry out
a radial excitation analysis assuming both LTE and non-LTE to localize the

assessing deuterium fractionation efficiencies and pathways at different disk

programmatic weak supervision is a growing paradigm within machine learning. In
this setting, users design heuristics that provide noisy labels for subsets of

form pseudolabels, which are then used to train a downstream model. In this
work, we question a foundational premise of the typical weakly supervised
learning pipeline: given that the heuristic provides all ``label"" information,
why do we need to generate pseudolabels at all? Instead, we propose to directly
transform the heuristics themselves into corresponding loss functions that
penalize differences between our model and the heuristic. By constructing
losses directly from the heuristics, we can incorporate more information than
is used in the standard weakly supervised pipeline, such as how the heuristics
make their decisions, which explicitly informs feature selection during
training. We call our method Losses over Labels (LoL) as it creates losses
directly from heuristics without going through the intermediate step of a
label. We show that LoL improves upon existing weak supervision methods on
several benchmark text and image classification tasks and further demonstrate
that incorporating gradient information leads to better performance on almost

In the phases immediately
preceding core-collapse, massive stars in the Galaxy with $M_i \gtrsim 20$
$M_{\odot}$ may appear as classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. As the final
contribution of a homogeneous RV survey, this work constrains the multiplicity
properties of northern Galactic late-type nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WNL) stars.
We compare their intrinsic binary fraction and orbital period distribution to
the carbon-rich (WC) and early-type nitrogen-rich (WNE) populations from
previous works. We obtained high-resolution spectra of the complete
magnitude-limited sample of 11 Galactic WNL stars with the Mercator telescope
on the island of La Palma. We used cross-correlation to measure relative RVs
and flagged binary candidates based on the peak-to-peak RV dispersion. By using
Monte Carlo sampling and a Bayesian framework, we computed the
three-dimensional likelihood and one-dimensional posteriors for the upper
period cut-off, power-law index, and intrinsic binary fraction. Adopting a
threshold $C$ of 50 km s$^{-1}$, our Bayesian analysis produced an intrinsic
fraction of $0.42\substack{+0.15 \\ -0.17}$ for the parent WNL population
alongside distributions for the power-law index and the orbital periods. The
observed period distribution of Galactic WN and WC binaries from the literature
is in agreement with what is found. The period distribution of Galactic WN
binaries peaks at $P{\sim}1$-$10$d and that of the WC population at
$P{\sim}5000\,$d. This shift cannot be reconciled by orbital evolution due to
mass loss or mass transfer. At long periods, the evolutionary sequence
O($\xrightarrow{}$LBV)$\xrightarrow{}$WN$\xrightarrow{}$WC seems feasible. The
high frequency of short-period WN binaries compared to WC binaries suggests

cloaking or superscattering where the challenging problem of inverse design
needs to be solved: finding a quantum-dot structure according to certain

computational infeasible. We articulate a machine-learning approach to
addressing the inverse-design problem where artificial neural networks subject

scattering efficiency as a function of the energy. We construct a physical loss
function that enables accurate prediction of the scattering characteristics. We
demonstrate that, in the regime of Klein tunneling, the scattering efficiency
can be designed to vary over two orders of magnitudes, allowing any scattering
curve to be generated from a proper combination of the gate potentials. Our

field induced phase transition has been observed inside the superconducting
state, which is proposed to be a transition from an even to an odd-parity
superconducting state. The odd-parity superconducting state and its large upper
critical field has been explained by local inversion symmetry breaking and
consequent Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here we report the experimental tuning
of the parity of superconductivity in CeRh2As2 via applied pressure.
Superconductivity is enhanced by pressure after its initial suppression,
forming a second dome. However, the odd-parity state only exists in the first
dome and the second dome is dominated by the even-parity state. This parity
switch of superconductivity under pressure is consistent with the competition
between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer hopping in determining the
parity of superconductivity in systems with local inversion symmetry breaking.
Our results provide insightful guidance on how to look for new odd-parity
superconductors.

boundary layer out of thermochemical equilibrium is investigated for the first
time by means of a direct numerical simulation. The freestream Mach number is
equal to 9 and the oblique shock impinges with a cooled flat-plate boundary
layer with an angle of 10{\deg}, generating a reversal flow region. In
conjunction with freestream disturbances, the shock impingement triggers a
transition to a fully turbulent regime shortly downstream of the interaction
region. Accordingly, wall properties emphasize the presence of a laminar
region, a recirculation bubble, a transitional zone and fully turbulent region.
The breakdown to turbulence is characterized by an anomalous increase of skin
friction and wall heat flux, due to the particular shock pattern. At the
considered thermodynamic conditions the flow is found to be in a state of
thermal non-equilibrium throughout, with non-equilibrium effects enhanced and
sustained by the shock-induced laminar/turbulent transition, while chemical
activity is almost negligible due to wall cooling. In the interaction region,
relaxation towards thermal equilibrium is delayed and the fluctuating values of
the rototranslational and the vibrational temperatures strongly differ, despite
the strong wall-cooling. The fully turbulent portion exhibits evolutions of
streamwise velocity, Reynolds stresses and turbulent Mach number in good
accordance with previous results for highly-compressible cooled-wall boundary
layers in thermal nonequilibrium, with turbulent motions sustaining thermal
nonequilibrium. Nevertheless, the vibrational energy is found to contribute
little to the total wall heat flux.

Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS)
measurements reveal the existence of two types of adsorbed HATCN molecules with
distinctly different appearances and magnetic states, as evident from the
presence or absence of an Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance. Our DFT results show
that HATCN on Ag(111) supports two almost isoenergetic states, both with one
excess electron transferred from the Ag surface, but with magnetic moments of
either 0 or 0.65 uB. Therefore, even though all molecules undergo charge
transfer of one electron from the Ag substrate, they exist in two different
molecular magnetic states that resemble a free doublet or an entangled spin
state. We explain how the origin of this behavior lies in the twofold
degeneracy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of gas phase HATCN,
lifted upon adsorption and charge-transfer from Ag(111). Our combined STM and

transactions to generate profits, the so-called miner extractable value (MEV).
Existing research recognizes MEV as a severe security issue and proposes
potential solutions, including prominent Flashbots. However, previous studies
have mostly analyzed blockchain data, which might not capture the impacts of
MEV in a much broader AI society. Thus, in this research, we applied natural
language processing (NLP) methods to comprehensively analyze topics in tweets
on MEV. We collected more than 20000 tweets with MEV and Flashbots hashtags and
analyzed their topics. Our results show that the tweets discussed profound
topics of ethical concern, including security, equity, emotional sentiments,
and the desire for solutions to MEV. We also identify the co-movements of MEV
activities on blockchain and social media platforms. Our study contributes to
the literature at the interface of blockchain security, MEV solutions, and AI
ethics.

this work, we develop a kinetic modeling package in the Julia language capable
of efficient numerical inversion of rate relationships for general kinetic

several identity authentication methods, among which biometric authentication

Presentation attack detection is a countermeasure that attempts to identify

financial services, healthcare, and education, use biometric authentication
services on various devices. This illustrates the significance of presentation
attack detection as the verification step. In this paper, we study

stochastic integer programs whose first-stage solutions can decompose into
disjoint components, each one having a monotonic recourse function. In a
minimization problem, the monotonicity property stipulates that the recourse
cost of a component must always be higher or equal to that of any of its
subcomponents. The method exploits new types of optimality cuts and lower
bounding functionals that are valid under this property. The stochastic vehicle
routing problem is particularly well suited to be solved by this approach, as
its solutions can be decomposed into a set of routes. We consider the variant
with stochastic demands in which the recourse policy consists of performing a
return trip to the depot whenever a vehicle does not have sufficient capacity
to accommodate a newly realized customer demand. This work shows that this
policy can lead to a non-monotonic recourse function, but that the monotonicity
holds when the customer demands are modeled by several commonly used families
of probability distributions. We also present new problem-specific lower bounds
on the recourse that strengthen the lower bounding functionals and
significantly speed up the resolution process. Computational experiments on
instances from the literature show that the new approach achieves
state-of-the-art results.

astronomers have inferred the orbital properties of planets using stellar
radial velocity (RV) measurements. For a star orbited by a single planet, the
stellar orbit is a dilation and $180^\circ$ rotation of the planetary orbit.
Thus, many of the Keplerian orbital properties of the star are identical to
those of the planet. However, there is a notable exception: the argument of
periastron, $\omega$, defined as the angle between the periapsis of an orbiting
body and its ascending node. The argument of periastron of the star
($\omega_\star$) is $180^\circ$ offset from the argument of periastron of the
planet ($\omega_p$). This distinction is important because some derivations of
the RV equation use $\omega_\star$, while others use $\omega_p$. This
discrepancy arises because commonly used derivations of the RV equation do not
adhere to a single coordinate system. As a result, there are inconsistencies in
the definitions of the Keplerian orbital parameters in various RV models,
leading to values of the ascending node and $\omega$ that are $180^\circ$
offset. For instance, some packages, such as \texttt{RadVel} and
\texttt{ExoFast}, report values for $\omega_{\star}$ that are identical to the
$\omega_p$ values determined with other packages, such as \texttt{TTVFast} and
\texttt{Orvara}, resulting in orbital solutions that differ by $180^\circ$.
This discrepancy highlights the need for standardized conventions and
definitions in RV modeling, particularly as we enter the era of combining RVs
with astrometry.

respectively. However, it is still an open challenging research question to
extract prosodic information because of the intrinsic association of different
attributes, such as timbre and rhythm, and because of the need for unsupervised
training schemes to achieve robust large-scale and speaker-independent ASR. The
aim of this paper is to address the disentanglement of emotional prosody from
speech based on unsupervised reconstruction. Specifically, we identify, design,
implement and integrate three crucial components in our proposed speech
reconstruction model Prosody2Vec: (1) a unit encoder that transforms speech
signals into discrete units for semantic content, (2) a pretrained speaker
verification model to generate speaker identity embeddings, and (3) a trainable
prosody encoder to learn prosody representations. We first pretrain the
Prosody2Vec representations on unlabelled emotional speech corpora, then
fine-tune the model on specific datasets to perform Speech Emotion Recognition
(SER) and Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) tasks. Both objective and subjective
evaluations on the EVC task suggest that Prosody2Vec effectively captures
general prosodic features that can be smoothly transferred to other emotional
speech. In addition, our SER experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset reveal that the
prosody features learned by Prosody2Vec are complementary and beneficial for
the performance of widely used speech pretraining models and surpass the
state-of-the-art methods when combining Prosody2Vec with HuBERT
representations. Some audio samples can be found on our demo website.

improvements in accuracy over the previously used projected Ehrenfest approach
and that these benefits are particularly pronounced in cases where the initial

do not arise when calculating linear electronic spectra, they play a vital role
in capturing multidimensional spectroscopies. We demonstrate the performance of
our method by showing that it is able to quantitatively capture the exact
linear, 2DES, and pump-probe spectra for a Frenkel exciton model in slow bath
regimes and is even able to reproduce the main spectral features in fast bath

adversarial exploitation of imperfections in quantum devices, by providing an
approach for secret key distillation with modest security assumptions.
Advantage distillation, a two-way communication procedure in error correction,
has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and
device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against
IID collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol
known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving
the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap
between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the
calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close
this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the
fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure
that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective
attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the
repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the
latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that
this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol.
Furthermore, using this security condition we obtain some improvements over
previous results on the noise tolerance thresholds for DIQKD. Our results
provide insight into a fundamental question in quantum information theory
regarding the circumstances under which DIQKD is possible.

consistent classifications when rotating galaxy images, which is always
required to be satisfied physically but difficult to achieve algorithmically.
The adaptive polar coordinate transformation, compared with the conventional
method of data augmentation by including additional rotated images in the
training set, is proved to be an effective and efficient method in improving
the robustness of the SML methods. In the previous work, we generated a catalog
of galaxies with well-classified morphologies via our developed unsupervised
machine learning (UML) method. By using this UML-dataset as the training set,
we apply the new method to classify galaxies into five categories
(unclassifiable, irregulars, late-type disks, early-type disks, and spheroids).
In general, the result of our morphological classifications following the
sequence from irregulars to spheroids agrees well with the expected trends of
other galaxy properties, including S\'{e}rsic indices, effective radii,
nonparametric statistics, and colors. Thus, we demonstrate that the

mechanisms to incentivize LER investments, while ensuring adequate market
revenues for investors, guiding investors' strategic investments towards social
optimum, and protecting consumers from scarcity prices. To reduce the impact of
excessive scarcity prices, we present a new market mechanism, which consists of
a Penalty payment for lost load, a supply Incentive, and an energy price Uplift
(PIU). We establish a game-theoretical framework to analyze market equilibrium.
We prove that one Nash equilibrium under the penalty payment and supply
incentive can reach the social optimum given quadratic supply costs of CERs.
Although the price uplift can ensure adequate revenues, the resulting system
cost deviates from the social optimum while the gap decreases as more CERs
retire. Furthermore, under the traditional marginal-cost pricing (MCP)
mechanism, investors may withhold investments to cause scarcity prices, but
such behavior is absent under the PIU mechanism. Simulation results show that
the PIU mechanism can reduce consumers' costs by over 30% compared with the MCP
mechanism by reducing excessive revenues of low-cost CERs from scarcity prices.

been used to great effect in certain classes of classical codes. When applied
to quantum codes there exist constant-weight errors (such as half of a

considered modified versions of flip, sometimes in conjunction with other
decoders. We argue that this may not always be necessary, and present numerical
evidence for the existence of a threshold for flip when applied to the looplike
syndromes of a three-dimensional toric code on a cubic lattice. This result can
be attributed to the fact that the lowest-weight uncorrectable errors for this
decoder are closer (in terms of Hamming distance) to correctable errors than to
other uncorrectable errors, and so they are likely to become correctable in
future code cycles after transformation by additional noise. Introducing
randomness into the decoder can allow it to correct these ""uncorrectable""
errors with finite probability, and for a decoding strategy that uses a
combination of belief propagation and probabilistic flip we observe a threshold
of $\sim5.5\%$ under phenomenological noise. This is comparable to the best
known threshold for this code ($\sim7.1\%$) which was achieved using belief
propagation and ordered statistics decoding [Higgott and Breuckmann, 2022], a
strategy with a runtime of $O(n^3)$ as opposed to the $O(n)$ ($O(1)$ when
parallelised) runtime of our local decoder. We expect that this strategy could

of collider bias, or Berkson's bias. In the language of causal models, a
collider is a variable causally influenced by two or more other variables.
Conditioning on a collider typically produces non-causal associations between
its contributing causes, even if they are actually independent. It is easy to
show that this phenomenon can produce associations analogous to Bell
correlations, in suitable post-selected ensembles. It is also straightforward
that such collider artefacts may become real connections, resembling causality,
if a collider is 'constrained' (e.g., by a future boundary condition). We
consider the time-reversed analogues of these points in the context of
retrocausal models of QM. Retrocausality yields a collider at the source of an
EPR-Bell particle pair, and in this case constraint of the collider is possible
by normal methods of experimental preparation. It follows that connections
resembling causality may be expected to emerge across such colliders, from one

where the base pauses during manipulation. Reactive control of the manipulator
enables grasping objects with unpredictable motion while improving robustness
against perception errors, environmental disturbances, and inaccurate robot
control compared to open-loop, trajectory-based planning approaches. We present
an example implementation of the architecture and investigate the performance
on a series of pick and place tasks with both static and dynamic objects and
compare the performance to baseline methods. Our method demonstrated a
real-world success rate of over 99%, failing in only a single trial from 120
attempts with a physical robot system. The architecture is further demonstrated
on other mobile manipulator platforms in simulation. Our approach reduces task
time by up to 48%, while also improving reliability, gracefulness, and
predictability compared to existing architectures for mobile manipulation. See

unstructured robotic tasks. Safe reinforcement learning methods open up new
possibilities to tackle this problem. However, the conservative policy updates
make it intractable to achieve sufficient exploration and desirable performance
in complex, sample-expensive environments. In this paper, we propose a
dual-agent safe reinforcement learning strategy consisting of a baseline and a
safe agent. Such a decoupled framework enables high flexibility, data
efficiency and risk-awareness for RL-based control. Concretely, the baseline
agent is responsible for maximizing rewards under standard RL settings. Thus,
it is compatible with off-the-shelf training techniques of unconstrained
optimization, exploration and exploitation. On the other hand, the safe agent
mimics the baseline agent for policy improvement and learns to fulfill safety
constraints via off-policy RL tuning. In contrast to training from scratch,
safe policy correction requires significantly fewer interactions to obtain a
near-optimal policy. The dual policies can be optimized synchronously via a
shared replay buffer, or leveraging the pre-trained model or the
non-learning-based controller as a fixed baseline agent. Experimental results
show that our approach can learn feasible skills without prior knowledge as
well as deriving risk-averse counterparts from pre-trained unsafe policies. The
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms on
difficult robot locomotion and manipulation tasks with respect to both safety
constraint satisfaction and sample efficiency.

intriguing. We report on the discovery of fast outflowing warm absorbers (WAs)
in the NLS1 PG 1001+054, with velocities in the range of 7000 to 9000
kilometers per second. They are identified with blueshifted Lyman alpha, N v
and Si iv lines in the high resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectra taken with the
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We
perform photoionization modeling using XSTAR with three WAs. The derived
physical properties are typical of WAs in terms of ionization and column
density, whereas the outflow velocities are significantly higher. The estimated
location of these WAs ranges from 1 to 73 parsecs away from the AGN. Together
with previous detection of high ionization absorber in the X-ray for PG
1001+054, we suggest that the fast outflowing UV absorber is probably a part of
a multiphase outflow. Such structure is likely produced by the outflow launched
from AGN at accretion disk scale, which shocks the ambient ISM producing
stratified absorbers. Assuming contribution from the three WAs at tens of
parsecs, the estimated ratio between the kinetic power of the outflow and AGN
Eddington luminosity could reach 1.7 percent, raising the possibility of
sufficient influence on the host galaxy when compared to some theoretical
models for efficient AGN feedback.

Although the extended tail and shell are prominent in the deep optical images,

dataset and 50 3D turbo/fast spin-echo MR images from our institute (in 2020

the degree of knee OA was initially graded according to the MRI Osteoarthritis
Knee Score (MOAKS) before being converted to binary OA phenotype labels. The
proposed UDA pipeline included (a) pre-processing, which involved automatic
segmentation and region-of-interest cropping; (b) source classifier training,
which involved pre-training phenotype classifiers on the source dataset; (c)
target encoder adaptation, which involved unsupervised adaption of the source
encoder to the target encoder and (d) target classifier validation, which
involved statistical analysis of the target classification performance
evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

trained without UDA for comparison. Results: The target classifier trained with

knee OA phenotypes compared with the classifier trained without UDA.
Conclusion: The proposed UDA approach improves the performance of automated

minority groups (i.e., waterbirds in lands or landbirds in water) due to the

improved the worst-group accuracy by focusing on the high-loss samples. The
hypothesis behind this is that such high-loss samples are
\textit{spurious-cue-free} (SCF) samples. However, these approaches can be
problematic since the high-loss samples may also be samples with noisy labels
in the real-world scenarios. To resolve this issue, we utilize the predictive
uncertainty of a model to improve the worst-group accuracy under noisy labels.
To motivate this, we theoretically show that the high-uncertainty samples are
the SCF samples in the binary classification problem. This theoretical result
implies that the predictive uncertainty is an adequate indicator to identify
SCF samples in a noisy label setting. Motivated from this, we propose a novel
ENtropy based Debiasing (END) framework that prevents models from learning the
spurious cues while being robust to the noisy labels. In the END framework, we
first train the \textit{identification model} to obtain the SCF samples from a
training set using its predictive uncertainty. Then, another model is trained
on the dataset augmented with an oversampled SCF set. The experimental results
show that our END framework outperforms other strong baselines on several

end of cosmic reionization at $z\sim6$. We generate 3000 synthetic quasar
sightlines to obtain a large number of LLS samples in the simulations. In
addition, with the high physical fidelity and resolution of CROC, we are able
to quantify the association between these LLS samples and nearby galaxies. Our
results show that a higher fraction of higher column density LLSs are spatially
associated with nearby galaxies. Moreover, we find that LLSs that are not near
any galaxy typically reside in filamentary structures connecting neighboring
galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This quantification of the
distribution and associations of LLSs to large scale structures informs our
understanding of the IGM-galaxy connection during the Epoch of Reionization,
and provides a theoretical basis for interpreting future observations.

propagation problems based on a combination of a higher-order phase-field model
and a non-conforming mesh using a NURBS-based isogeometric approach. This
combination, as demonstrated in this paper, is of great benefit in reducing the
computational cost of using a local refinement mesh and a higher-order
phase-field, which needs higher derivatives of basis functions. Compared with
other approaches using a local refinement mesh, the Virtual
Uncommon-Knot-Inserted Master-Slave (VUKIMS) method presented here is not only
simple to implement but can also reduce the variable numbers. VUKIMS is an
outstanding choice in order to establish a local refinement mesh, i.e. a
non-conforming mesh, in a multi-patch problem. A phase-field model is an
efficient approach for various complicated crack patterns, including those with
or without an initial crack path, curved cracks, crack coalescence, and crack
propagation through holes. The paper demonstrates that cubic NURBS elements are
ideal for balancing the computational cost and the accuracy because they can
produce accurate solutions by utilising a lower degree of freedom number than
an extremely fine mesh of first-order B-spline elements.

different contrastive views, has become a popular paradigm for vision
representation learning. Inspired by the success in computer vision, recent
work introduces CL into graph modeling, dubbed as graph contrastive learning
(GCL). However, generating contrastive views in graphs is more challenging than
that in images, since we have little prior knowledge on how to significantly
augment a graph without changing its labels. We argue that typical data
augmentation techniques (e.g., edge dropping) in GCL cannot generate diverse
enough contrastive views to filter out noises. Moreover, previous GCL methods
employ two view encoders with exactly the same neural architecture and tied
parameters, which further harms the diversity of augmented views. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm named model augmented GCL
(MA-GCL), which will focus on manipulating the architectures of view encoders
instead of perturbing graph inputs. Specifically, we present three
easy-to-implement model augmentation tricks for GCL, namely asymmetric, random
and shuffling, which can respectively help alleviate high- frequency noises,
enrich training instances and bring safer augmentations. All three tricks are
compatible with typical data augmentations. Experimental results show that
MA-GCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification
benchmarks by applying the three tricks on a simple base model. Extensive
studies also validate our motivation and the effectiveness of each trick.

propagation. It uses a scalar auxiliary variable, namely a phase-field
variable, to model a discontinuity zone in a continuity domain. Furthermore,
the fourth-order phase-field approach produces a better convergence rate and
more accurate solutions than the second-order one. However, it is available for
modeling crack propagation in brittle material. This study addresses the
fourth-order phase-field model combining the non-standard phase-field form with
a cohesive zone model (CZM) to predict crack propagation in quasi-brittle
material. A Cornelisson's softening law is used to capture the high precision
of crack propagation prediction. The concrete material is considered as a
quasi-brittle one. For computation efficiency using NURBS-based finite
elements, Virtual Uncommon-Knot-Inserted Master-Slave (VUKIMS) technique is
employed to derive a local refinement mesh. Numerical results are verified by
the published ones from literature. It was found that the peak load and crack
path are independent of the element size and insensitive to the length-scale
number using the fourth-order phase-field CZM. Our proposed model shows the
most significant advantage compared to the standard phase-field approach in

that converts a full-precision model into a quantized model using
lower-precision data types. Although it can help reduce the size and
computational cost of deep neural networks, it can also introduce quantization
noise and reduce prediction accuracy, especially in extremely low-bit settings.
How to determine the appropriate quantization parameters (e.g., scaling factors
and rounding of weights) is the main problem facing now. Existing methods
attempt to determine these parameters by minimize the distance between features
before and after quantization, but such an approach only considers local
information and may not result in the most optimal quantization parameters. We
analyze this issue and ropose PD-Quant, a method that addresses this limitation
by considering global information. It determines the quantization parameters by
using the information of differences between network prediction before and
after quantization. In addition, PD-Quant can alleviate the overfitting problem
in PTQ caused by the small number of calibration sets by adjusting the
distribution of activations. Experiments show that PD-Quant leads to better
quantization parameters and improves the prediction accuracy of quantized
models, especially in low-bit settings. For example, PD-Quant pushes the
accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 53.14% and RegNetX-600MF up to 40.67% in weight

images to train a classification model. Existing studies, however, fine-tuned
the pre-trained model with the same contrastive learning objective, and failed
to exploit the multi-labeled nature of medical image-report pairs. In this
paper, we propose a new fine-tuning strategy based on sentence sampling and
positive pair loss relaxation for improving the downstream zero-shot pathology
classification performance, which can be applied to any pre-trained contrastive
image-text encoders. Our method consistently showed dramatically improved
zero-shot pathology classification performance on four different chest X-ray
datasets and 3 different pre-trained models (5.77% average AUROC increase). In
particular, fine-tuning CLIP with our method showed much comparable or
marginally outperformed to board-certified radiologists (0.619 vs 0.625 in F1

potential predictors can be larger than the sample size, we consider using
LASSO, a popular L1-penalized regression method, to estimate the sparse
coefficients when many unit root regressors are present. Consistency of LASSO
relies on two building blocks: the deviation bound of the cross product of the
regressors and the error term, and the restricted eigenvalue of the Gram matrix
of the regressors. In our setting where unit root regressors are driven by
temporal dependent non-Gaussian innovations, we establish original
probabilistic bounds for these two building blocks. The bounds imply that the
rates of convergence of LASSO are different from those in the familiar cross
sectional case. In practical applications given a mixture of stationary and
nonstationary predictors, asymptotic guarantee of LASSO is preserved if all
predictors are scale-standardized. In an empirical example of forecasting the
unemployment rate with many macroeconomic time series, strong performance is
delivered by LASSO when the initial specification is guided by macroeconomic
domain expertise.

control microfluidic dynamics due to the enhanced and confined light absorption
from the intrinsic losses of metals. Dielectrics, counterpart of metals, is
used to avoid undesired thermal effects due to its negligible light absorption.
Here, we report an innovative optofluidic system that leverages a quasi-BIC
driven all-dielectric metasurface to achieve nanoscale control of temperature
and fluid motion. Our experiments show that suspended particles down to 200
nanometers can be rapidly aggregated to the center of the illuminated
metasurface with a velocity of tens of micrometers per second, and up to
millimeter-scale particle transport is demonstrated. The strong electromagnetic
field enhancement of the quasi-BIC resonance can facilitate increasing the flow
velocity up to 3-times compared with the off-resonant situation. We also
experimentally investigate the dynamics of particle aggregation with respect to
laser wavelength and power. A physical model is presented to elucidate the
phenomena and surfactants are added to the particle colloid to validate the
model. Our study demonstrates the application of the recently emerged
all-dielectric thermonanophotonics in dealing with functional liquids and opens
new frontiers in harnessing non-plasmonic nanophotonics to manipulate

stimulus in a group, which is an important factor that shapes group behavior
and outcomes. Recognizing group affect involves identifying important
individuals and salient objects among a crowd that can evoke emotions. Most of
the existing methods are proposed to detect faces and objects using pre-trained
detectors and summarize the results into group emotions by specific rules.
However, such affective region selection mechanisms are heuristic and
susceptible to imperfect faces and objects from the pre-trained detectors.
Moreover, faces and objects on group-level images are often contextually
relevant. There is still an open question about how important faces and objects
can be interacted with. In this work, we incorporate the psychological concept
called Most Important Person (MIP). It represents the most noteworthy face in
the crowd and has an affective semantic meaning. We propose the Dual-branch
Cross-Patch Attention Transformer (DCAT) which uses global image and MIP
together as inputs. Specifically, we first learn the informative facial regions
produced by the MIP and the global context separately. Then, the Cross-Patch
Attention module is proposed to fuse the features of MIP and global context

PNS due to non-monotonicity and the challenge of counterfactual estimation
limit its wide use. To address the non-identifiability of PNS, we resort to a
lower bound of PNS that can be optimized via counterfactual estimation, and
propose Necessary and Sufficient Explanation for GNN (NSEG) via optimizing that

we introduce VINet, a unified deep learning-based CP network for scalable,

first CP method designed from the standpoint of large-scale system-level
implementation and can be divided into three main phases: 1) Global
Pre-Processing and Lightweight Feature Extraction which prepare the data into
global style and extract features for cooperation in a lightweight manner; 2)
Two-Stream Fusion which fuses the features from scalable and heterogeneous
perception nodes; and 3) Central Feature Backbone and 3D Detection Head which
further process the fused features and generate cooperative detection results.
An open-source data experimental platform is designed and developed for CP
dataset acquisition and model evaluation. The experimental analysis shows that
VINet can reduce 84% system-level computational cost and 94% system-level
communication cost while improving the 3D detection accuracy.

detected in the cores, jets and lobes of all the quasars, with cores primarily
displaying magnetic (B-) fields transverse to, and jets displaying fields
aligned with the jet direction. Hotspots display either transverse B-fields
signifying B- field compression at terminal shocks or more complex structures.
The fractional polarization in the cores ranges from 1-10% and jets/lobes from
10-40%. Several of the quasars show distorted or hybrid FRI/FRII radio
morphologies with indications of restarted AGN activity. We attribute this to
the optical/UV selection criteria of the PG sample that remains unbiased at
radio frequencies. The in-band spectral indices of the radio cores are
relatively flat while they are steep in the hotspots. This is consistent with
the polarization structures where the hotspots appear to be locations of jet
bends or bow-shocks. We present global properties for the entire PG ""blazar""

higher accretion rates result in more powerful radio jets. A correlation
between the radio core fractional polarization and the 150 MHz total radio
luminosity for the 9 quasars studied here may imply that more organized
B-fields at the jet bases lead to higher core fractional polarization and to
more powerful radio jets.

work on universal sound separation has investigated separating a target sound

systems provide a natural and scalable interface for specifying arbitrary
target sounds. However, supervised text-queried sound separation systems
require costly labeled audio-text pairs for training. Moreover, the audio
provided in existing datasets is often recorded in a controlled environment,
causing a considerable generalization gap to noisy audio in the wild. In this
work, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only
unlabeled data. We propose to leverage the visual modality as a bridge to learn
the desired audio-textual correspondence. The proposed CLIPSep model first
encodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to
condition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the
model is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test
time we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting,
thanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model.
Further, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background
noise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual
correspondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called
noise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on
noisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully
learn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled

of almost any machine learning algorithm. Existing deep ensemble methods
usually naively train many different models and then aggregate their
predictions. This is not optimal in our view from two aspects: i) Naively
training multiple models adds much more computational burden, especially in the
deep learning era; ii) Purely optimizing each base model without considering
their interactions limits the diversity of ensemble and performance gains. We
tackle these issues by proposing deep negative correlation classification
(DNCC), in which the accuracy and diversity trade-off is systematically
controlled by decomposing the loss function seamlessly into individual accuracy
and the correlation between individual models and the ensemble. DNCC yields a
deep classification ensemble where the individual estimator is both accurate
and negatively correlated. Thanks to the optimized diversities, DNCC works well
even when utilizing a shared network backbone, which significantly improves its
efficiency when compared with most existing ensemble systems. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and network structures demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method.

reaction $e^+e^- \rightarrow \bar{n}n$ with data collected with the BESIII

of 354.6 pb$^{-1}$ in total at twelve center-of-mass energies between $\sqrt{s}

magnetic form factors, respectively, is achieved at $\sqrt{s} = 2.3935$ GeV.
Our results are comparable in accuracy to those from electron scattering in the
comparable space-like (negative $q^2$) region of four-momentum transfer. The
electromagnetic form factor ratio $R_{\rm em}\equiv |G_E|/|G_M|$ is within the
uncertainties close to unity. We compare our result on $|G_E|$ and $|G_M|$ to
recent model predictions, and the measurements in the space-like region to test
the analyticity of electromagnetic form factors.

current systems have attained unprecedented performances for such tasks, the

systems performing poorly on rare senses. To this end, we consider data
augmentation to increase the frequency of these least frequent senses (LFS) to
reduce the distributional bias of senses during training. We propose
Sense-Maintained Sentence Mixup (SMSMix), a novel word-level mixup method that
maintains the sense of a target word. SMSMix smoothly blends two sentences
using mask prediction while preserving the relevant span determined by saliency
scores to maintain a specific word's sense. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt to apply mixup in NLP while preserving the meaning of a
specific word. With extensive experiments, we validate that our augmentation

scanners by embedding targets in gel wax to determine the image uniformity,
lateral and axial resolution, and diameter of a stainless-steel disc. Materials
and Methods: Acoustic property (AP), which includes the velocity of US (cus),
acoustic impedance (Z), and attenuation coefficient in gel wax were determined.
The cus, and attenuation coefficient were estimated using the pulse-echo
technique. Z was obtained from the product of sample density (\r{ho}) and cus.
Two rectangular frames using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheets with holes
separated by 5, 10, and 20 mm distances were constructed. Nylon filaments and
SS-disc (diameter = 16.8 mm) were threaded through the frames and suitably
placed in melted gel wax to obtain orthogonal targets. The targets were
measured using computerized tomography (CT) and a 2-9 MHz US probe. Results:
The AP of gel wax were cus=1418 m/s, \r{ho}= 0.87 g/cm3, Z=1.23 MRayls,
attenuation coefficient= 0.88 dB/cm/MHz. The results of US imaging of the
targets were compared with their physical sizes and served as baselines for the
scanner and probe. The maximum error in distance measurement in the phantom US
images was 7.1%, and the phantom volume decreased by 1.8% over 62 weeks.
Conclusion: Gel wax can be useful in developing affordable, highly stable, and
customizable diagnostic US phantoms that can be implemented widely.

that achieves high-resolution imaging. In the inversion part of the method that
brings high resolution in finding a convergence point in the model space, a
local numerical optimization algorithm minimizes the objective function based
on the norm using the least-square form. Since the norm is sensitive to
outliers and noise, the method may often lead to inaccurate imaging results.
Thus, a new regulation form with a more practical relaxation form is proposed
to solve the overfitting drawback caused by the use of the norm,, namely the
K-support norm, which has the form of more reasonable and tighter constraints.
In contrast to the least-square method that minimizes the norm, our K-support
constraints combine the and the norms. Then, a quadratic penalty method is
adopted to linearize the non-linear problem to lighten the computational load.
This paper introduces the concept of the K-support norm and integrates this
scheme with the quadratic penalty problem to improve the convergence and
robustness against background noise. In the numerical example, two synthetic
models are tested to clarify the effectiveness of the K-support norm by
comparison to the conventional norm with noisy data set. Experimental results
indicate that the modified FWI based on the new regularization form effectively
improves inversion accuracy and stability, which significantly enhances the
lateral resolution of depth inversion even with data with a low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR).

Converting classical image data into the quantum domain and state label
preparation complexity is still a challenging issue. The existing techniques
normally connect the pixel values and the state position directly. Recently,
the EFRQI (efficient flexible representation of the quantum image) approach
uses an auxiliary qubit that connects the pixel-representing qubits to the
state position qubits via Toffoli gates to reduce state connection. Due to the
twice use of Toffoli gates for each pixel connection still it requires a
significant number of bits to connect each pixel value. In this paper, we
propose a new SCMFRQI (state connection modification FRQI) approach for further
reducing the required bits by modifying the state connection using a reset gate
rather than repeating the use of the same Toffoli gate connection as a reset
gate. Moreover, unlike other existing methods, we compress images using
block-level for further reduction of required qubits. The experimental results
confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of
both image representation and compression points of view.

enough to correctly predict the identity of the user up to 85% of the time.
Moreover, by using a non-parametric classifier, we scale up TUL to over 100k
users which is an increase over state-of-the-art by three orders of magnitude.
Extensive empirical analysis on four real-world datasets (Brightkite,
Foursquare, Gowalla and Weeplaces) compares our findings to state-of-the-art

essentially on the study of flats which do not bound flat half-spaces --
so-called Morse flats. We show that the Tits boundary $\partial_T F$ of a

success on a wide range of downstream tasks, e.g., zero-shot classification,
retrieval and image captioning. However, their successes highly rely on the
scale and quality of web-crawled data that naturally contain incomplete and
noisy information (e.g., wrong or irrelevant content). Existing works either
design manual rules to clean data or generate pseudo-targets as auxiliary
signals for reducing noise impact, which do not explicitly tackle both the
incorrect and incomplete challenges simultaneously. In this paper, to
automatically mitigate the impact of noise by solely mining over existing data,
we propose a principled Noise-robust Language-Image Pre-training framework
(NLIP) to stabilize pre-training via two schemes: noise-harmonization and
noise-completion. First, in noise-harmonization scheme, NLIP estimates the
noise probability of each pair according to the memorization effect of
cross-modal transformers, then adopts noise-adaptive regularization to
harmonize the cross-modal alignments with varying degrees. Second, in
noise-completion scheme, to enrich the missing object information of text, NLIP
injects a concept-conditioned cross-modal decoder to obtain semantic-consistent
synthetic captions to complete noisy ones, which uses the retrieved visual
concepts (i.e., objects' names) for the corresponding image to guide captioning
generation. By collaboratively optimizing noise-harmonization and
noise-completion schemes, our NLIP can alleviate the common noise effects
during image-text pre-training in a more efficient way. Extensive experiments
show the significant performance improvements of our NLIP using only 26M data
over existing pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, FILIP and BLIP) on 12 zero-shot

aligning with publicly-available correlated databases has been of scientific
interest recently. While most of the rigorous analyses of database matching
have focused on random-distortion models, the adversarial-distortion models
have been wanting in the relevant literature. In this work, motivated by
synchronization errors in the sampling of time-indexed microdata, matching
(alignment) of random databases under adversarial column deletions is
investigated. It is assumed that a constrained adversary, which observes the
anonymized database, can delete up to a $\delta$ fraction of the columns
(attributes) to hinder matching and preserve privacy. Column histograms of the
two databases are utilized as permutation-invariant features to detect the
column deletion pattern chosen by the adversary. The detection of the column
deletion pattern is then followed by an exact row (user) matching scheme. The
worst-case analysis of this two-phase scheme yields a sufficient condition for
the successful matching of the two databases, under the near-perfect recovery
condition. A more detailed investigation of the error probability leads to a
tight necessary condition on the database growth rate, and in turn, to a
single-letter characterization of the adversarial matching capacity. This
adversarial matching capacity is shown to be significantly lower than the
random matching capacity, where the column deletions occur randomly. Overall,
our results analytically demonstrate the privacy-wise advantages of adversarial
mechanisms over random ones during the publication of anonymized time-indexed
data.

difficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that
there has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central
engine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical
mechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple
study addressing this question by making use of the ""high-latitude emission""
(HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature
of HLE in the decaying phase of ""broad pulses"" of GRBs. We show that the HLE
can emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\nu}$ spectra and dominate the
peak of $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectra even while the ""line-of-sight emission"" (LoSE) is
still ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence. We remark that this
""HLE break"" could be hidden in some broad pulses, depending on the proximity
between the peak energies of the LoSE and the HLE. Also, we present three
examples of Fermi-GBM GRBs with broad pulses that exhibit the HLE signature. We
show that their gamma-ray emitting region should be located at $\sim 10^{16}$
cm from the central engine, which disfavors the photosphere models and
small-radii internal shock models but favors magnetic dissipation models with a

a relativistic spherical jet, where higher latitude photons are delayed and
softer than the observer's line-of-sight emission. The signature of HLE has not
yet been identified undisputedly during the prompt emission of GRBs. The HLE
theory predicts a specific relation, F$_{\nu, E_{p}}$ $\propto$ E$_{p}\!^{2}$,
between the peak energy $E_{p}$ in $\nu$F$_{\nu}$ spectra and the spectral flux
F$_{\nu}$ measured at $E_{p}$, F$_{\nu, E_{p}}$. We search for evidence of this
relation in 2157 GRBs detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) from the years 2008 to 2017. After
imposing unbiased selection criteria in order to minimize contamination in a
signal by background and overlaps of pulses, we build a sample of 32 broad
pulses in 32 GRBs. We perform a time-resolved spectral analysis on each of
these 32 broad pulses and find that the evolution of 18 pulses (56%) is clearly
consistent with the HLE relation. For the 18 broad pulses, the exponent
$\delta$ in the relation of F$_{\nu, E_{p}}$ $\propto$ E$_{p}\!^{\delta}$ is

  The widespread adoption of data analytics has led to a call to improve the
traditional ways of big data processing. There have been demands for making the
analytics process more interactive and adaptive, especially for long running
jobs. The importance of initial results in the iterative process of data
wrangling has motivated a result-aware approach to big data analytics. This
dissertation is motivated by these calls for improvement in data processing and
the experiences over the past few years while working on the Texera project,
which is a collaborative data analytics service being developed at UC Irvine.
This dissertation mainly consists of three parts. The first part is about the
design of the Amber engine that serves as the backend data processing framework
for the Texera service. The second part is about an adaptive and result-aware
skew-handling framework called Reshape. Reshape uses fast control messages to
implement iterative skew mitigation techniques for a wide variety of operators.
The mitigation techniques in Reshape have also been analyzed from the
perspective of their effects on the results shown to the user. The last part is
about a result-aware workflow scheduling framework called Maestro. This part
talks about how to schedule a workflow for execution on computing clusters and
make result-aware decisions while doing so. This work improves the data
analytics process by bringing interactivity, adaptivity and result-awareness

aims to explicitly remove domain-specific features for domain generalization.
Following this approach, we propose a novel framework called Learning and
Removing Domain-specific features for Generalization (LRDG) that learns a
domain-invariant model by tactically removing domain-specific features from the
input images. Specifically, we design a classifier to effectively learn the
domain-specific features for each source domain, respectively. We then develop
an encoder-decoder network to map each input image into a new image space where
the learned domain-specific features are removed. With the images output by the
encoder-decoder network, another classifier is designed to learn the
domain-invariant features to conduct image classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance
compared with state-of-the-art methods.

  demonstrated in virtual reality",,,,,"cs.CV cs.GR cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A digital twin is a powerful tool that can help monitor and optimize physical
assets in real-time. Simply put, it is a virtual representation of a physical
asset, enabled through data and simulators, that can be used for a variety of
purposes such as prediction, monitoring, and decision-making. However, the
concept of digital twin can be vague and difficult to understand, which is why
a new concept called ""capability level"" has been introduced. This concept
categorizes digital twins based on their capability and defines a scale from
zero to five, with each level indicating an increasing level of functionality.
These levels are standalone, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive,
and autonomous. By understanding the capability level of a digital twin, we can
better understand its potential and limitations. To demonstrate the concepts,
we use a modern house as an example. The house is equipped with a range of
sensors that collect data about its internal state, which can then be used to
create digital twins of different capability levels. These digital twins can be
visualized in virtual reality, allowing users to interact with and manipulate
the virtual environment. The current work not only presents a blueprint for
developing digital twins but also suggests future research directions to
enhance this technology. Digital twins have the potential to transform the way
we monitor and optimize physical assets, and by understanding their
capabilities, we can unlock their full potential.

forest classifier or regressor as possible while keeping classification
performance. As a constraint for preventing from accuracy degradation, we first
consider the one that the decision paths of all the given feature vectors must
not change. For a branching condition that a value of a certain feature is at
most a given threshold, the set of values satisfying such constraint can be
represented as an interval. Thus, the problem is reduced to the problem of
finding the minimum set intersecting all the constraint-satisfying intervals
for each set of branching conditions on the same feature. We propose an
algorithm for the original problem using an algorithm solving this problem
efficiently. The constraint is relaxed later to promote further sharing of
branching conditions by allowing decision path change of a certain ratio of the
given feature vectors or allowing a certain number of non-intersected
constraint-satisfying intervals. We also extended our algorithm for both the
relaxations. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments using 21 datasets (13 classification and 8 regression

Doppler Imager instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory were utilized. Each AR was classified as a regular bipolar AR
(classes A1 or A2), or as an irregular bipolar AR (class B1), or as a
multipolar AR (classes B2 or B3). Unipolar ARs were segregated into a specific
class U. We found the following results. Unsigned magnetic fluxes from ARs of
different classes evolve synchronously following the cycle, the correlation
coefficient between the flux curves varies in a range of (0.70 - 0.99). The
deepest solar minimum is observed simultaneously for all classes. Only the most
simple ARs were observed during a deepest minimum: A1- and B1-class ARs. The
overall shape of a cycle is governed by the regular ARs, whereas the fine
structure of a solar maximum is determined by the most complex irregular ARs.
Approximately equal amount of flux (45$-$50% of the total flux) is contributed
by the A-class and B-class ARs during a solar maximum. Thus, observations allow
us to conclude that the appearance of ARs with the magnetic flux above
10$^{21}$ Mx is caused by the solar dynamo that operates as a unique process

learn, for example, delayed effects, high non-linearity, non-stationarity,
partial observability and, more important, error accumulation when using
bootstrapped predictions (predictions based on past predictions), over large
time horizons. Here we explore the use of Reinforcement Learning in this
problem. We elaborate on why and how this problem fits naturally and sound as a
Reinforcement Learning problem, and present some experimental results that
demonstrate RL is a promising technique to solve these kind of problems.

curves $P$ and $Q$. The data structure variant of the problem is a longstanding
open problem: Efficiently preprocess $P$, so that for any $Q$ given at query
time, one can efficiently approximate their Fr\'{e}chet distance. There exist
conditional lower bounds that prohibit $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate
Fr\'{e}chet distance computations in subquadratic time, even when preprocessing
$P$ using any polynomial amount of time and space. As a consequence, the
problem has been studied under various restrictions: restricting $Q$ to be a
(horizontal) segment, or requiring $P$ and $Q$ to be so-called \emph{realistic}
input curves.
  We give a data structure for $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate discrete
Fr\'{e}chet distance in any metric space $\mathcal{X}$ between a realistic
input curve $P$ and any query curve $Q$. After preprocessing the input curve
$P$ (of length $|P|=n$) in $O(n \log n)$ time, we may answer queries specifying
a query curve $Q$ and an $\varepsilon$, and output a value $d(P,Q)$ which is at
most a $(1+\varepsilon)$-factor away from the true Fr\'{e}chet distance between
$Q$ and $P$. Our query time is asymptotically linear in $|Q|=m$,
$\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, $\log n$, and the realism parameter $c$ or $\kappa$.
Our data structure is the first to: adapt to the approximation parameter
$\varepsilon$ at query time, handle query curves with arbitrarily many
vertices, work for any ambient space of the curves, or be dynamic.
  The method presented in this paper simplifies and generalizes previous
contributions to the static problem variant. We obtain efficient queries (and
therefore static algorithms) for Fr\'{e}chet distance computation in
high-dimensional spaces and other ambient metric spaces.

counterintuitive and contrasts with relative conclusions in the existing

explained by classical means -- is certainly one of the most striking features
of quantum mechanics. Its range of applications in device-independent protocols
is constantly growing. Many relevant quantum features can be inferred from
violations of Bell inequalities, including entanglement detection and
quantification, and state certification applicable to systems of arbitrary
number of particles. A complete characterisation of nonlocal correlations for
many-body systems is, however, a computationally intractable problem. Even if
one restricts the analysis to specific classes of states, no general method to
tailor Bell inequalities to be violated by a given state is known. In this work
we provide a general construction of Bell inequalities that are maximally
violated by graph states of any prime local dimension. These form a broad class
of multipartite quantum states that have many applications in quantum
information, including quantum error correction. We analytically determine
their maximal quantum violation, a number of high relevance for
device-independent applications of Bell inequalities. Finally, we show that

However, previous work on scaling laws has primarily used private data \&

limitations, we investigate scaling laws for contrastive language-image

training on large-scale labeled data. However, publicly available datasets
contain uncertain facial expressions caused by ambiguous annotations or
confusing emotions, which could severely decline the robustness. Previous
studies usually follow the bias elimination method in general tasks without
considering the uncertainty problem from the perspective of different
corresponding sources. In this paper, we propose a novel method of multi-task
assisted correction in addressing uncertain facial expression recognition
called MTAC. Specifically, a confidence estimation block and a weighted
regularization module are applied to highlight solid samples and suppress
uncertain samples in every batch. In addition, two auxiliary tasks, i.e.,
action unit detection and valence-arousal measurement, are introduced to learn
semantic distributions from a data-driven AU graph and mitigate category
imbalance based on latent dependencies between discrete and continuous
emotions, respectively. Moreover, a re-labeling strategy guided by
feature-level similarity constraint further generates new labels for identified
uncertain samples to promote model learning. The proposed method can flexibly
combine with existing frameworks in a fully-supervised or weakly-supervised
manner. Experiments on RAF-DB, AffectNet, and AffWild2 datasets demonstrate
that the MTAC obtains substantial improvements over baselines when facing
synthetic and real uncertainties and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

relationship between the water's thermodynamic anomalies and kinetics of phase
transition from metastable water is relatively unexplored. In this work, we
have employed classical density functional theory to provide a unified and
coherent picture of nucleation (both vapor and ice) from metastable water,
especially at negative pressure conditions. Our results suggest a peculiar
non-monotonic temperature dependence of liquid-vapor surface tension at
temperatures where liquid-vapor coexistence is metastable with respect to the
ice phase. The vapor nucleation barrier on isochoric cooling also shows a
non-monotonic temperature dependence. We further note that, for lower density
isochores, the temperature of minimum vapor nucleation barrier ($T_{\Delta
\Omega_{\rm v/min}^*}$) does not coincide with the temperature of maximum
density (TMD) where metastability is maximum. The temperature difference
between the $T_{\Delta \Omega_{\rm v/min}^*}$ and the TMD, however, decreases
with increasing the density of the isochore, suggesting a strong correlation
between the propensity of cavitation and metastability of the liquid water at
high densities. The vapor nucleation barrier along isobaric cooling shows an
interesting crossover behavior where it first increases on lowering the
temperature and then shows a non-monotonic behavior in the vicinity of the
Widom line on further lowering the temperature. Our results on the ice
nucleation from metastable water show an anomalous retracing behavior of the
ice nucleation barrier along isotherms and theoretically validate the recent
findings that the reentrant ice(Ih)-liquid coexistence can induce a drastic
change in the kinetics of ice nucleation. In addition, this study also provides
deeper insights into the origin of the isothermal compressibility maximum on
isochoric cooling.

insulating phase via an intermediate topological metallic phase. Single
crystals of SnBi2Te4 are characterized by various experimental probes including
Synchrotron based X-ray diffraction, magnetoresistance, Hall effect, Seebeck

unit cell volume below 100 K, which significantly affects the bulk band

functional theory calculations. Simulated surface states at 15 K agree fairly
well with our ARPES data and are found to be robust with varying T. This

hydrogen-helium mixtures (Chabrier \& Debras 2021), which takes into account
the interactions between hydrogen and helium species, upon the evolution of
very low mass stars and brown dwarfs (BD). These interactions modify the
thermodynamic properties of the H/He mixture, notably the entropy, a quantity
of prime importance for these fully convective bodies, but also the onset and
the development of degeneracy throughout the body. This translates into a
faster cooling rate, i.e. cooler isentropes for a given mass and age, and thus
larger brown dwarf masses and smaller radii for given effective temperature and
luminosity than the models based on previous EOSs. This means that objects of a
given mass and age, in the range $M\lesssim 0.1\,\msol$, $\tau\gtrsim 10^8$ yr,
will have cooler effective temperatures and fainter luminosities. Confronting
these new models with several observationally determined BD dynamical masses,
we show that this improves the agreement between evolutionary models and
observations and resolves at least part of the observed discrepancies between
the properties of dynamical mass determinations and evolutionary models. A
noticeable consequence of this improvement of the dense H/He EOS is that it
yields a larger H-burning minimum mass, now found to be $0.075\,\msol$

for speeding up air-traffic controllers (ATCos) training. E.g., a human pilot
is still required in EUROCONTROL's ESCAPE lite simulator (see
https://www.eurocontrol.int/simulator/escape) during ATCo training. However,
this need can be substituted by an automatic system that could act as a pilot.
In this paper, we aim to develop and integrate a pseudo-pilot agent into the
ATCo training pipeline by merging diverse artificial intelligence (AI) powered
modules. The system understands the voice communications issued by the ATCo,
and, in turn, it generates a spoken prompt that follows the pilot's phraseology
to the initial communication. Our system mainly relies on open-source AI tools
and air traffic control (ATC) databases, thus, proving its simplicity and ease
of replicability. The overall pipeline is composed of the following: (1) a
submodule that receives and pre-processes the input stream of raw audio, (2) an
automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transforms audio into a sequence
of words; (3) a high-level ATC-related entity parser, which extracts relevant
information from the communication, i.e., callsigns and commands, and finally,
(4) a speech synthesizer submodule that generates responses based on the
high-level ATC entities previously extracted. Overall, we show that this system
could pave the way toward developing a real proof-of-concept pseudo-pilot
system. Hence, speeding up the training of ATCos while drastically reducing its
overall cost.

(1) A constant factor, (2) a multi-ionisation photoelectric absorption model,

propagators within an approach based on the rainbow truncated Dyson-Schwinger
equations in Landau gauge. The method, early used for modeling the quark, ghost
and gluon propagators in vacuum, is extended to finite temperatures. In
Euclidean space, within the Matsubara imaginary-time formalism it is necessary
to distinguish between the transversal and longitudinal, with respect to the
heat bath, gluon dressing functions, for which the Dyson-Schwinger equation
splits into a corresponding system of coupled equations. This system is
considered within the rainbow approximation generalized to finite temperatures
and solved numerically. The solutions for the ghost and gluon propagators are
obtained as functions of temperature $T$, Matsubara frequency $\Omega_n$ and
three-momentum squared ${\bf k}^2$. It is found that, for zero Matsubara
frequency, the dependence of the ghost and gluon dressing functions on ${\bf
k}^2$ are not sensitive to the temperature $T$, while at ${\bf k}^2=0$ their
dependence on $T$ is quite strong. Dependence on the Matsubara frequency
$\Omega_n$ is investigated as well.The performed numerical analysis of the
solution of the Dyson-Schwinger equations shows that at certain value of the
temperature $T_0\sim 150$ MeV the iteration procedure does not longer converge.
In the vicinity of $T_0$ the longitudinal gluon propagator increases quite
fastly, whereas the transversal propagator does not exhibit any irregularity.
This in a qualitative agreement with results obtained within the QCD lattice
calculations in this temperature interval.

they resolve the inherent scarcity in the number of transactions that can be
added to each block. In early blockchain protocols, this scarcity was resolved
through a first-price auction in which users were forced to guess appropriate
bids from recent blockchain data. Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee market reform
streamlines this process through the use of a base fee that is increased (or
decreased) whenever a block exceeds (or fails to meet) a specified target block
size. Previous work has found that the EIP-1559 mechanism may lead to a base
fee process that is inherently chaotic, in which case the base fee does not
converge to a fixed point even under ideal conditions. However, the impact of
this chaotic behavior on the fee market's main design goal -- blocks whose
long-term average size equals the target -- has not previously been explored.
As our main contribution, we derive near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the
time-average block size in the EIP-1559 mechanism despite its possibly chaotic
evolution. Our lower bound is equal to the target utilization level whereas our
upper bound is approximately 6% higher than optimal. Empirical evidence is
shown in great agreement with these theoretical predictions. Specifically, the
historical average was approximately 2.9% larger than the target rage under
Proof-of-Work and decreased to approximately 2.0% after Ethereum's transition
to Proof-of-Stake. We also find that an approximate version of EIP-1559
achieves optimality even in the absence of convergence.

landscape and offers an objective analysis of the major FL algorithms through a
comprehensive cross-evaluation for a wide range of operating conditions. In
addition to the three foundational FL algorithms, this work also analyzes six
derived algorithms. To enable a uniform assessment, a multi-FL framework named
FLAGS: Federated Learning AlGorithms Simulation has been developed for rapid
configuration of multiple FL algorithms. Our experiments indicate that fully
decentralized FL algorithms achieve comparable accuracy under multiple
operating conditions, including asynchronous aggregation and the presence of
stragglers. Furthermore, decentralized FL can also operate in noisy
environments and with a comparably higher local update rate. However, the
impact of extremely skewed data distributions on decentralized FL is much more

  Message-Passing Approach","21 pages, 21 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multitarget tracking in the interference environments suffers from the
nonuniform, unknown and time-varying clutter, resulting in dramatic performance
deterioration. We address this challenge by proposing a robust multitarget
tracking algorithm, which estimates the states of clutter and targets
simultaneously by the message-passing (MP) approach. We define the
non-homogeneous clutter with a finite mixture model containing a uniform
component and multiple nonuniform components. The measured signal strength is
utilized to estimate the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of targets and the
mean clutter-to-noise ratio (CNR) of clutter, which are then used as additional
feature information of targets and clutter to improve the performance of
discrimination of targets from clutter. We also present a hybrid data
association which can reason over correspondence between targets, clutter, and
measurements. Then, a unified MP algorithm is used to infer the marginal
posterior probability distributions of targets, clutter, and data association
by splitting the joint probability distribution into a mean-field approximate
part and a belief propagation part. As a result, a closed-loop iterative
optimization of the posterior probability distribution can be obtained, which
can effectively deal with the coupling between target tracking, clutter
estimation and data association. Simulation results demonstrate the performance
superiority and robustness of the proposed multitarget tracking algorithm
compared with the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and the
cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter.

contrastive learning based on the latent variable model is used to decouple the
various textual genres in the latent space. We devise supervised and

We performed extensive experiments on three dialogue datasets, including a

reveals the presence of a contribution to level splitting in external magnetic
field that is proportional to $\cos \phi$, where $\phi$ is the gauge-invariant
phase difference across the junction. To elucidate the origin of this
unanticipated effect, we systematically study the Zeeman splitting of spinful
subgap states in the superconducting Anderson impurity model. The magnitude of
the splitting is renormalized by the exchange interaction between the local
moment and the continuum of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in a variant of the
Knight shift phenomenon. The leading term in the shift is linear in the
hybridisation strength $\Gamma$ (quadratic in electron hopping), while the
subleading term is quadratic in $\Gamma$ (quartic in electron hopping) and
depends on $\phi$ due to spin-polarization-dependent corrections to the
Josephson energy of the device. The amplitude of the $\phi$-dependent part is
largest for experimentally relevant parameters beyond the perturbative regime
where it is investigated using numerical renormalization group calculations.
Such magnetic-field-tunable coupling between the quantum dot spin and the
Josephson current could find wide use in superconducting spintronics.

definitions based on temperature/density thresholds or hybrid approaches. The
upper ocean pycnocline (UOP) that sits below the mixed layer base remains
poorly characterised, though this transition layer is an ubiquitous feature of
the ocean surface layer. Available hydrographic profiles provide near-global
coverage of the world's ocean and are used to build a seasonal climatology of
UOP properties -- intensity, depth, thickness -- to characterise the spatial
and seasonal variations of upper ocean stratification. The largest
stratification values $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}\,s^{-2})$ are found in the
intertropical band, where seasonal variations of the UOP are also very small.
The deepest ($>$ 200 m) and least stratified $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6}\,s^{-2})$
UOPs are found in winter along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and at
high latitudes of the North Atlantic. The UOP thickness has a median value of
23 m with limited seasonal and spatial variations; only a few regions have UOP
thicknesses exceeding 35 m. The UOP properties allow the characterisation of
the upper ocean restratification that generally occurs in early spring and is
generally associated with large variability. Depending on the region, this
restratification may happen gradually as around the Rockall plateau or abruptly
as in the Kuroshio Extension. The UOP is also likely to merge intermittently
with the permanent pycnocline in winter. The upper limit of the UOP is
eventually consistent with MLD estimates, except in a few notable regions such
as in the Pacific Warm Pool where barrier layers are important, and during
wintertime at high latitudes of the North Pacific.

We draw on research from Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis to compute
the optimal control policy for tracking a flight path, while enforcing safety
constraints on the system. In addition, the zero-sublevel set of the computed
value function inherent in HJ reachability analysis indicates the backward
reachable set, the set of states from which it is possible to safely drive the
system into a target set within a given time without entering undesirable

provide a safe hybrid control law. In such a setup, the safety controller is
only activated when the system approaches the boundary of its maneuverability

representing a $1$-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the
data into the circle that captures this hole, and that is of minimum energy in
a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the
output circle-valued maps can be ""geometrically correlated"" even if the chosen
cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work
that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear
combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being
chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric
correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case,
corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet
energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy
torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent
cohomology classes. We showcase our procedure with computational examples. Our
main algorithm is based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lov\'asz algorithm from
computational number theory.

self-consistently employ the atomistic non-equilibrium Green's function

different CBF, namely the zeroing control barrier functions (ZCBF), exponential

unfoldings of directed graphs in semantics of programs. We study these two
notions from a graph theoretical point of view so as to highlight their
similarities, as they are both defined in terms of surjective graph
homomorphisms. In particular, universal coverings and complete unfoldings are
infinite trees that are regular if the initial graphs are finite. Regularity
means that a tree has finitely many subtrees up to isomorphism. Two important
theorems have been established by Leighton and Norris for coverings. We prove
similar statements for unfoldings.
  Our study of the difficult proof of Leighton's Theorem lead us to generalize
coverings and similarly, unfoldings, by attaching finite or infinite weights to
edges of the covered or unfolded graphs. This generalization yields a canonical
factorization of the universal covering of any finite graph, that (provably)
does not exist without using weights. Introducing infinite weights provides us
with finite descriptions of regular trees having nodes of countably infinite
degree. We also generalize to weighted graphs and their coverings a classical
factorization theorem of their characteristic polynomials.

extreme values observed at a set of spatial sites. Full likelihood inference
for max-stable data is, however, complicated by the form of the likelihood
function as it contains a sum over all partitions of sites. As such, the number
of terms to sum over grows rapidly with the number of sites and quickly becomes
prohibitively burdensome to compute.
  We propose a variational inference approach to full likelihood inference that
circumvents the problematic sum. To achieve this, we first posit a parametric
family of partition distributions from which partitions can be sampled. Second,
we optimise the parameters of the family in conjunction with the max-stable
model to find the partition distribution best supported by the data, and to
estimate the max-stable model parameters.
  In a simulation study we show that our method enables full likelihood
inference in higher dimensions than previous methods, and is readily applicable
to data sets with a large number of observations. Furthermore, our method can
easily be extended to a Bayesian setting. Code is available at

the gauge freedom problem. To handle these problems, we propose a learnable
iterative graph optimizer minimizing a gauge-invariant cost function with an
edge rectification strategy to mitigate the effect of inaccurate measurements.
Our graph optimizer iteratively refines the global camera rotations by
minimizing each node's single rotation objective function. Besides, our
approach iteratively rectifies relative rotations to make them more consistent
with the current camera orientations and observed relative rotations.
Furthermore, we employ a gated recurrent unit to improve the result by tracing
the temporal information of the cost graph. Our framework is a real-time
learning-to-optimize rotation averaging graph optimizer with a tiny size
deployed for real-world applications. RAGO outperforms previous traditional and

scaling symmetry and its compensation (under the violations of the same). Due
to two photon coupling, they can produce optical signatures in a magnetic
field. In vacuum or plain matter they couple to one of the transversely
polarized state of the photon. But in a magnetized matter, they couple to both
the transversely polarized state of photon (due to emergence of a parity
violating part of photon self energy contribution from a magnetized matter). A
part of this work is directed towards understanding the issue of mixing of
scalar with various polarizations states of photon in a medium ( magnetized or
unmagnetized ) due to the constraints from different discrete (CPT) symmetries
associated with the interaction. Based on these symmetry aided arguments, the
structure of the mixing matrix is found to be $3 \times 3$. Thus there exists
non-zero finite probabilities of oscillation between different polarization
states of photon to dilaton. Our analytical and numerical analysis show no
existence of periodic oscillation length either in temporal or spatial

  We show that local tabularity does not depend on reflexivity. Namely, given a

frames, where the reflexive closure operation was applied to every relation in
every frame in $\mathcal{C}$ . We show that if the logic of

locally tabular as well.
  On relational structures and on logics, we describe operations which preserve
local tabularity. Namely, we consider the operation of sum on Kripke frames,
where a family of frames-summands is indexed by elements of another frame. We
show that if both the logic of indices and the logic of summands are locally
tabular, then the logic of corresponding sums is also locally tabular. Using
this theorem, we give a tabularity-preserving operation on logics. Namely, for

provided to ensure the global well-posedness of pathwise (strong in
probabilistic sense) weak (in the PDE sense) solutions to the KS-SNS system.
Compared with the existing works, the novelties here are three folds: First,
the initial data $n_0(x)$ belongs to a larger class of functions with decay
rate slower than $1/|x|^{3+}$ at infinity, which removes the condition
$n_0|x|\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ arising from the Lyapunov inequality; Second, the
structural and monotonicity conditions for the sensitivity $\chi(\cdot)$ and
consumption rate $\kappa (\cdot)$ are unnecessary, but instead concise
hypothesis on the diffusion coefficients $d_i$, $i=1,2,3$, which depends only
on the given profiles; Third, the proof of the main results depends upon a
newly introduced three-layer approximation procedure, and our approach is a
first combination of the direct convergence method in [Li, et al.
\emph{Stochastic Process. Appl.} 135 (2021) 139-182], the stochastic analogue
of entropy-energy functional inequality and the stochastic compactness method,

significant agile adoption barriers. Objective: Thus, our objective is to
tackle this field and come up with important contributions for further
research. To this end, we want to identify challenges that arise from the
interplay between agility and organizational culture. Method: This is done
based on an iterative research approach. On the one hand, we gathered
qualitative data among our network of agile practitioners. Then, we derived in
sum 15 challenges with agile culture. On the other hand, we gathered
quantitative data by means of a questionnaire study with 92 participants.
Results: We identified 7 key challenges out of the 15 challenges with agile
culture. The results that are presented in a conceptual model show a focus on
human aspects that we need to deal with more in future. Conclusion: Based on
our results, we started deriving future work aspects to do more detailed

at generating a concise summary in a different target language. Unlike
monolingual summarization (MS), naturally occurring source-language documents
paired with target-language summaries are rare. To collect large-scale CLS
samples, existing datasets typically involve translation in their creation.
However, the translated text is distinguished from the text originally written
in that language, i.e., translationese. Though many efforts have been devoted
to CLS, none of them notice the phenomenon of translationese. In this paper, we
first confirm that the different approaches to constructing CLS datasets will
lead to different degrees of translationese. Then we design systematic
experiments to investigate how translationese affects CLS model evaluation and
performance when it appears in source documents or target summaries. In detail,
we find that (1) the translationese in documents or summaries of test sets
might lead to the discrepancy between human judgment and automatic evaluation;
(2) the translationese in training sets would harm model performance in the
real scene; (3) though machine-translated documents involve translationese,
they are very useful for building CLS systems on low-resource languages under
specific training strategies. Furthermore, we give suggestions for future CLS
research including dataset and model developments. We hope that our work could
let researchers notice the phenomenon of translationese in CLS and take it into
account in the future.

the client optima by periodically skipping federated averaging and scattering
local models to the cross devices. We provide theoretical analysis of the
possible benefit from FedSkip and conduct extensive experiments on a range of

  In 1993, Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, Simonovits, S\'{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di proposed to
determine the value of $\rho(3,q)$ for $q\ge3$, and they conjectured that for
$q \ge 2$, $\rho \left( {3,2q - 1} \right) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \frac{1}{r(3,q) -
1})$. Recently, Kim, Kim and Liu (2019) conjectured that for $q \ge 2$, $\rho(
{3,2q } ) = \frac{1}{2}( 1 - \frac{1}{r( {3,q} )})$. Erd\H{o}s et al. (1993)
determined $\rho(3,q)$ for $q=3,4,5$ and $\rho(4,4)$. There is no progress on
this classical Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n density in the past thirty years. In this
paper, we obtain $\rho(3,6)=\frac{5}{12}$ and $\rho(3,7)=\frac{7}{16}$.
Moreover, we show that the corresponding asymptotically extremal structures are
weakly stable, which answers a problem of Erd\H{o}s et al. (1993) for the two
cases.

the HERA combined data as a base, heavy quark cross section measurement
together with Tevatron data on jet production and H1 and ZEUS jet cross
sections as ""non-LHC"" data, and especially the ""LHC"" data set for top-quark and
jet cross sections. These different data sets have allowed detailed information
at low $x$, worth information on the nucleon's flavor and have played an
important role for some PDFs at large-$x$ and strong coupling constant. Since
the large-$x$ gluon PDF benefits from an accurate determination of quark PDFs,
we have enough motivation to focus on the top-quark production and jet cross
section measurements from LHC to find the impact of these data on the gluon PDF
and strong coupling constant. These experimental data have an impact on the
relative uncertainties of PDF. The gluon PDF at large-$x$ and the values of
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$ are affected significantly. Although, the main motivation of
this paper is to focus on gluon PDF and also its uncertainty at large-$x$, but
notice to heavy PDFs behavior in this region is also very important. We study

and Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) modify the Hamiltonian of neutrino
oscillation in a similar fashion, it is very difficult to distinguish these two
effects. The only difference between them lies in the fact that NSI depends on
the matter density, whereas LIV is independent of the earth matter effect.
Therefore for a fixed baseline experiment, where matter density is constant,
the theories describing NSI and LIV are exactly equivalent. However, as the
present and future bounds of the NSI and LIV parameters are not equivalent, one
can distinguish these two scenarios in the long-baseline neutrino experiments
depending on their statistics with respect to the present and future bounds of
these parameters. In this paper, we attempt to differentiate between LIV and
NSI in the context of DUNE and P2SO, as these two future experiments are
believed to be sensitive to the strongest matter effect and will have very
large statistics. Taking LIV in the data and NSI in theory, our results show
that, indeed it is possible to have good discrimination between LIV and NSI.
The best separation between LIV and NSI at $3 \sigma$ C.L. is achieved for the
parameter $a_{\mu\mu}$ with P2SO. In this case, the value of LIV parameter for
which separation is possible, lies within its future bound, if one considers
the value of NSI parameter to be constrained by the present experiments.
Between DUNE and P2SO, the latter has better sensitivity for such
discrimination.

beneficial effect towards s-wave superconductivity. In the presence of a finite
Zeeman field, when superconductivity is suppressed by Pauli pair-breaking, the
Rashba coupling counteracts the spin imbalance created by the Zeeman field by
mixing the spins, and thus restores superconductivity at finite temperatures.

procedures for testing joint Gaussianity of structural errors vector is not
sufficient to validate the latter requirement, because rejection of the null

possibly non-fundamental SVARMA models. Under our setup, current procedures are
invalid since reduced-form errors are a possibly infinite, linear combination

to operations within a single blockchain, failing to support cross-chain

smart general fair exchange protocol, to ensure scalability, fairness, and
atomicity of cross-chain interactions. Besides, Cross-Channel provides strong

Through a 50-instance deployment of Cross-Channel on AliCloud, we demonstrate
that Cross-Channel is well-suited for processing cross-chain transactions in

which uses downscaled climate model precipitation projections to forecast
extremal streamflow. Spatial dependence for the model is specified as a convex
combination of transformed Gaussian and max-stable processes, indexed by a
weight parameter which identifies the asymptotic regime of the process. The
weight parameter is modeled as a function of the annual precipitation for each
of the two hydrologic regions within the CUS, introducing spatio-temporal
non-stationarity within the model. The NPMM is flexible with desirable tail
dependence properties, but yields an intractable likelihood. To address this,
we embed a neural network within a density regression model which is used to
learn a synthetic likelihood function using simulations from the NPMM with
different parameter settings. Our model is fitted using observational data for
1972--2021, and inference carried out in a Bayesian framework. The two regions
within the CUS are estimated to be in different asymptotic regimes based on the
posterior distribution of the weight parameter. Annual streamflow maxima

IRAS23226-3843 showed a strong X-ray and optical outburst in 2019. It varied in
the X-ray and optical continuum by a factor of 5 and 1.6, respectively, within
two months. This corresponds to a factor of 3 in the optical after correction
for the host galaxy contribution. The Balmer and FeII emission-line intensities
showed comparable variability amplitudes. The Halpha profiles changed from a
blue-peaked profile in the years 1997 and 1999 to a broad double-peaked profile
in 2017 and 2019. However, there were no major profile variations in the
extremely broad double-peaked profiles despite the strong intensity variations
in 2019. One year after the outburst, the optical spectral type changed and
became a Seyfert type 2 in 2020. Blue outflow components are present in the
Balmer lines and in the Fe band in the X-rays. A deep broadband
XMM-Newton/NuSTAR spectrum was taken during the maximum state in 2019. This
spectrum is qualitatively very similar to a spectrum taken in 2017, but by a
factor of 10 higher. The soft X-ray band appears featureless. The soft excess
is well modeled with a Comptonization model. A broadband fit with a power-law
continuum, Comptonized soft excess, and Galactic absorption gives a good fit to
the combined EPIC-pn and NuSTAR spectrum. In addition, we see a complex and

their rocking joints are protected against compressive concrete damage through
steel jacketing. To produce seismic fragility functions, initially,
multi-parameter probabilistic seismic demand models (PSDMs) are generated for
various engineering demand parameters through five different ML techniques
(including neural network) and considering various sources of uncertainty, and
the most accurate PSDMs are selected. The selected PSDMs are then interpreted
using four different methods to investigate the effects of two key SRR column
design parameters (self-centering coefficient and SMA link initial strain) and
ambient temperature on the seismic performance of SRR columns. Subsequently,
using neural networks, the PSDMs developed earlier, and appropriate capacity
models, multi-parameter fragility functions are developed for various bridge
damage states. After examining the effects of the two SRR column design
parameters on the seismic fragility of the bridge, its seismic fragility is
compared with those of the same bridge with monolithic RC and posttensioned

strain of the SMA links and decreasing the self-centering coefficient as
possible (i.e., without compromising the self-centering) reduce the overall
bridge damage. In addition, even considering the ambient temperature's
uncertainty, SRR columns are proven, at least, as effective as PT columns in

  Annotation-Efficient Supervision","12 pages and 7 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated medical image segmentation using deep neural networks typically
requires substantial supervised training. However, these models fail to
generalize well across different imaging modalities. This shortcoming,
amplified by the limited availability of annotated data, has been hampering the
deployment of such methods at a larger scale across modalities. To address
these issues, we propose M-GenSeg, a new semi-supervised training strategy for
accurate cross-modality tumor segmentation on unpaired bi-modal datasets. Based
on image-level labels, a first unsupervised objective encourages the model to
perform diseased to healthy translation by disentangling tumors from the
background, which encompasses the segmentation task. Then, teaching the model
to translate between image modalities enables the synthesis of target images
from a source modality, thus leveraging the pixel-level annotations from the
source modality to enforce generalization to the target modality images. We
evaluated the performance on a brain tumor segmentation datasets composed of
four different contrast sequences from the public BraTS 2020 challenge dataset.
We report consistent improvement in Dice scores on both source and unannotated
target modalities. On all twelve distinct domain adaptation experiments, the
proposed model shows a clear improvement over state-of-the-art domain-adaptive
baselines, with absolute Dice gains on the target modality reaching 0.15.

to its special design of multi-layer intermediate latent variables. However,
existing semantic discovery methods on StyleGAN rely on manual selection of
modified latent layers to obtain satisfactory manipulation results, which is
tedious and demanding. In this paper, we propose a model that automates this
process and achieves state-of-the-art semantic discovery performance. The model
consists of an attention-equipped navigator module and losses contrasting
deep-feature changes. We propose two model variants, with one contrasting
samples in a binary manner, and another one contrasting samples with learned
prototype variation patterns. The proposed losses are defined with pretrained
deep features, based on our assumption that the features can implicitly reveal
the desired semantic structure including consistency and orthogonality.
Additionally, we design two metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance
of semantic discovery methods on FFHQ dataset, and also show that disentangled
representations can be derived via a simple training process. Experimentally,
our models can obtain state-of-the-art semantic discovery results without
relying on latent layer-wise manual selection, and these discovered semantics
can be used to manipulate real-world images.

reconstructing particle tracks scales worse than quadratically with track
density. Accurately and efficiently assigning the collection of hits left in

paper presents a quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm that uses a
support vector machine (SVM) with a quantum-estimated kernel to classify a set
of three hits (triplets) as either belonging to or not belonging to the same
particle track. The performance of the algorithm is then compared to a fully

the classical algorithm for the innermost layers of the detector that are

economic complexity to quantify the ability of locations -- on the level of

neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity based on the local portfolio of
diverse and non-ubiquitous amenities in Budapest, Hungary. Socio-economic

individuals and by characterizing their status by the real-estate price of

correlated with the urban centrality of locations. Urban centrality is a strong
predictor of socio-economic mixing, but both neighborhood complexity and

combines urban mobility data with economic complexity thinking to show that the

of manifold-valued functions. On the one hand, we approach the problem via
computing suitable weighted Riemannian barycenters. To satisfy the conditions
for Hermite interpolation, the sampled derivative information is converted into
a condition on the derivatives of the associated weight functions. It turns out
that this requires the solution of linear systems of equations, but no vector
transport is necessary. This approach treats all given sample data points
equally and is intrinsic in the sense that it does not depend on local
coordinates or embeddings. As an alternative, we consider Hermite interpolation
in a tangent space. This is a straightforward approach, where one designated
point, for example one of the sample points or (one of) their center(s) of
mass, is chosen to act as the base point at which the tangent space is
attached. The remaining sampled locations and sampled derivatives are mapped to
said tangent space. This requires a vector transport between different tangent
spaces. The actual interpolation is then conducted via classical vector space
operations. The interpolant depends on the selected base point. The validity
and performance of both approaches is illustrated by means of numerical
examples.

Feedback Alignment and momentum to compute low-variance gradient estimates in

been the dominant approach to robust classification. Building on recent work on
adversarial training (AT)-based generative models, we investigate using AT to
learn unnormalized class-conditional density models and then performing
generative robust classification. Our result shows that, under the condition of
similar model capacities, the generative robust classifier achieves comparable
performance to a baseline softmax robust classifier when the test data is clean
or when the test perturbation is of limited size, and much better performance
when the test perturbation size exceeds the training perturbation size. The
generative classifier is also able to generate samples or counterfactuals that
more closely resemble the training data, suggesting that the generative
classifier can better capture the class-conditional distributions. In contrast
to standard discriminative adversarial training where advanced data
augmentation techniques are only effective when combined with weight averaging,
we find it straightforward to apply advanced data augmentation to achieve
better robustness in our approach. Our result suggests that the generative
classifier is a competitive alternative to robust classification, especially
for problems with limited number of classes.

MANTa is a differentiable tokenizer trained end-to-end with the language model.
The resulting system offers a trade-off between the expressiveness of

In addition, our tokenizer is highly explainable since it produces an explicit

several English datasets from different domains as well as on synthetic noise.
We find that MANTa improves robustness to character perturbations and
out-of-domain data. We then show that MANTa performs comparably to other models
on the general-domain GLUE benchmark. Finally, we show that it is considerably
faster than strictly byte-level models.

achieve direct sparse predictions, their performance still lags behind dense
detectors with post-processing for 3D object detection from point clouds. DETRs
usually adopt a larger number of queries than GTs (e.g., 300 queries v.s. 40
objects in Waymo) in a scene, which inevitably incur many false positives
during inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sparse 3D
detector, named Query Contrast Voxel-DETR (ConQueR), to eliminate the
challenging false positives, and achieve more accurate and sparser predictions.
We observe that most false positives are highly overlapping in local regions,
caused by the lack of explicit supervision to discriminate locally similar
queries. We thus propose a Query Contrast mechanism to explicitly enhance
queries towards their best-matched GTs over all unmatched query predictions.
This is achieved by the construction of positive and negative GT-query pairs
for each GT, and a contrastive loss to enhance positive GT-query pairs against
negative ones based on feature similarities. ConQueR closes the gap of sparse
and dense 3D detectors, and reduces up to ~60% false positives. Our
single-frame ConQueR achieves new state-of-the-art (sota) 71.6 mAPH/L2 on the

aims to improve the real-world test performance of a model trained on simulated
data. It can save the cost of manually labeling data in real-world applications
such as robot vision and autonomous driving. Traditional UDA often assumes that
there are abundant unlabeled real-world data samples available during training
for the adaptation. However, such an assumption does not always hold in
practice owing to the collection difficulty and the scarcity of the data. Thus,
we aim to relieve this need on a large number of real data, and explore the
one-shot unsupervised sim-to-real domain adaptation (OSUDA) and generalization
(OSDG) problem, where only one real-world data sample is available. To remedy
the limited real data knowledge, we first construct the pseudo-target domain by
stylizing the simulated data with the one-shot real data. To mitigate the
sim-to-real domain gap on both the style and spatial structure level and
facilitate the sim-to-real adaptation, we further propose to use class-aware
cross-domain transformers with an intermediate domain randomization strategy to
extract the domain-invariant knowledge, from both the simulated and
pseudo-target data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for OSUDA

through a planet's atmosphere during transit, are most often assessed globally,
resulting in a single spectrum per planetary atmosphere. However, the inherent
three-dimensional nature of planetary atmospheres, via thermal, chemical, and
dynamical processes, can imprint inhomogeneous structure and properties in the
observables. In this work, we devise a technique for spatially mapping the
atmospheres of exoplanets in transmission. Our approach relaxes the assumption
that transit light curves are created from circular stars occulted by circular
planets, and instead we allow for flexibility in the planet's sky-projected
shape. We define the planet's radius to be a single-valued function of angle
around its limb, and we refer to this mathematical object as a transmission
string. These transmission strings are parameterised in terms of Fourier
series, a choice motivated by these series having adjustable complexity,
generating physically practical shapes, while being reducible to the classical
circular case. The utility of our technique is primarily intended for
high-precision multi-wavelength light curves, from which inferences of
transmission spectra can be made as a function of angle around a planet's
terminator, enabling analysis of the multidimensional physics at play in
exoplanet atmospheres. More generally, the technique can be applied to any
transit light curve to derive the shape of the transiting body. The algorithm
we develop is available as an open-source package, called harmonica.

involves a trade-off between speed and effectiveness of convergence. While
there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of how large the

this work, we introduce the maximal initial learning rate $\eta^{\ast}$ - the
largest learning rate at which a randomly initialized neural network can
successfully begin training and achieve (at least) a given threshold accuracy.
Using a simple approach to estimate $\eta^{\ast}$, we observe that in
constant-width fully-connected ReLU networks, $\eta^{\ast}$ behaves differently
from the maximum learning rate later in training. Specifically, we find that
$\eta^{\ast}$ is well predicted as a power of depth $\times$ width, provided
that (i) the width of the network is sufficiently large compared to the depth,
and (ii) the input layer is trained at a relatively small learning rate. We
further analyze the relationship between $\eta^{\ast}$ and the sharpness
$\lambda_{1}$ of the network at initialization, indicating they are closely
though not inversely related. We formally prove bounds for $\lambda_{1}$ in

problems paved the way for learning methods with scarce number of samples. Due
to this reason, one-shot learning still remains one of the most challenging and
trending concepts of deep learning as it proposes to simulate the human-like
learning approach in classification problems. Previous studies have focused on
generating more accurate fingerprints of the population using graph neural
networks (GNNs) with connectomic brain graph data. Thereby, generated
population fingerprints named connectional brain template (CBTs) enabled
detecting discriminative bio-markers of the population on classification tasks.
However, the reverse problem of data augmentation from single graph data
representing brain connectivity has never been tackled before. In this paper,
we propose an augmentation pipeline in order to provide improved metrics on our
binary classification problem. Divergently from the previous studies, we
examine augmentation from a single population template by utilizing graph-based
generative adversarial network (gGAN) architecture for a classification
problem. We benchmarked our proposed solution on AD/LMCI dataset consisting of
brain connectomes with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Late Mild Cognitive

compositionality evaluation benchmark, CREPE, which measures two important
aspects of compositionality identified by cognitive science literature:
systematicity and productivity. To measure systematicity, CREPE consists of a
test dataset containing over $370K$ image-text pairs and three different
seen-unseen splits. The three splits are designed to test models trained on
three popular training datasets: CC-12M, YFCC-15M, and LAION-400M. We also
generate $325K$, $316K$, and $309K$ hard negative captions for a subset of the

different complexities plus $183K$ hard negative captions with atomic, swapping
and negation foils. The datasets are generated by repurposing the Visual Genome
scene graphs and region descriptions and applying handcrafted templates and
GPT-3. For systematicity, we find that model performance decreases consistently
when novel compositions dominate the retrieval set, with Recall@1 dropping by
up to $12\%$. For productivity, models' retrieval success decays as complexity
increases, frequently nearing random chance at high complexity. These results
hold regardless of model and training dataset size.

obtainable quality of solution using the state-of-the-art quantum annealer
D-Wave Advantage 5.2/5.3. By studying the annealing process, we find annealing
configuration parameters that obtain feasible solutions close to the reference
solution generated by the classical ILP-solver CPLEX.
  Further, we studied the scaling of the network problem and provide
estimations on quantum annealer's hardware requirements to enable a proper QUBO
problem embedding of larger networks. We achieved the QUBO embedding of
networks with up to 6 nodes on the D-Wave Advantage. According to our estimates
a real-sized network with 12 to 16 nodes require a QA hardware with at least
50000 qubits or more.

such as the open-ended evolution of virtual creatures, is one of the main goals
of artificial life. Lenia, a family of cellular automata (CA) generalizing
Conway's Game of Life to continuous space, time and states, has attracted a lot
of attention because of the wide diversity of self-organizing patterns it can
generate. Among those, some spatially localized patterns (SLPs) resemble
life-like artificial creatures and display complex behaviors. However, those
creatures are found in only a small subspace of the Lenia parameter space and
are not trivial to discover, necessitating advanced search algorithms.
Furthermore, each of these creatures exist only in worlds governed by specific
update rules and thus cannot interact in the same one. This paper proposes as
mass-conservative extension of Lenia, called Flow Lenia, that solve both of
these issues. We present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in
generating SLPs with complex behaviors and show that the update rule parameters
can be optimized to generate SLPs showing behaviors of interest. Finally, we
show that Flow Lenia enables the integration of the parameters of the CA update
rules within the CA dynamics, making them dynamic and localized, allowing for
multi-species simulations, with locally coherent update rules that define
properties of the emerging creatures, and that can be mixed with neighbouring
rules. We argue that this paves the way for the intrinsic evolution of
self-organized artificial life forms within continuous CAs.

Foresight, a novel transformer-based pipeline that uses named entity
recognition and linking tools to convert document text into structured, coded
concepts, followed by providing probabilistic forecasts for future medical
events such as disorders, substances, procedures and findings. We processed the
entire free-text portion from three different hospital datasets totalling
811336 patients covering both physical and mental health. Findings: On tests in

Foresight was also validated on 34 synthetic patient timelines by five

prioritisation of different population groups. Evaluating vaccine allocation is
therefore a crucial element of pandemics response. In the present work, we
develop a model to retrospectively evaluate age-dependent counterfactual
vaccine allocation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. To estimate the
effect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a
simulation-assisted causal modelling approach which combines a compartmental
infection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained, data-driven causal model and
literature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel's implemented
vaccine allocation strategy in 2021 to counterfactual strategies such as no
prioritisation, prioritisation of younger age groups or a strict risk-ranked
approach; we find that Israel's implemented strategy was indeed highly
effective. We also study the marginal impact of increasing vaccine uptake for a
given age group and find that increasing vaccinations in the elderly is most
effective at preventing severe cases, whereas additional vaccinations for
middle-aged groups reduce infections most effectively. Due to its modular
structure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We
demonstrate this flexibility by investigating vaccine allocation strategies for
a pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish Flu. Our approach thus helps
evaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic
factors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine

We introduce the Enumerated Signed-continued-fraction Massey Approve (ESMA)

in integer sequences that represent mathematical constants. The ESMA algorithm
found various known formulas for $e, e^2, tan(1)$, and ratios of values of
Bessel functions. The algorithm further discovered a large number of new
conjectures for these constants, some providing simpler representations and
some providing faster numerical convergence than the corresponding simple
continued fractions. Along with the algorithm, we present mathematical tools
for manipulating continued fractions. These connections enable us to

stressing the service from the point of view of an attacker. However, research
and practice show that different scanners perform differently in vulnerability
detection. This paper presents a qualitative evaluation of security
vulnerabilities found in web applications. Some well-known vulnerability
scanners have been used to identify security flaws in web service
implementations. Many vulnerabilities have been observed, which confirms that
many services are deployed without proper security testing. Additionally,
having reviewed and considered several articles, the differences in the
vulnerabilities detected and the high number of false positives observed
highlight the limitations of web vulnerability scanners in detecting security
vulnerabilities in web services. Furthermore, this work will discuss the static
analysis approach for discovering security vulnerabilities in web applications
and complimenting it with proven research findings or solutions. These
vulnerabilities include broken access control, cross-site scripting, SQL
injections, buffer overflow, unrestricted file upload, broken authentications,
etc. Web applications are becoming mission-essential components for businesses,
potentially risking having several software vulnerabilities that hackers can
exploit maliciously. A few Vulnerability scanners have been used to detect
security weaknesses in web service applications, and many vulnerabilities have
been discovered, thus confirming that many online apps are launched without
sufficient security testing.

correcting under and over-exposed images simultaneously. Three issues remain
open to handle and correct under and over-exposed images in a unified way.
First, a locally-adaptive exposure adjustment may be more flexible instead of
learning a global mapping. Second, it is an ill-posed problem to determine the
suitable exposure values locally. Third, photos with the same content but
different exposures may not reach consistent adjustment results. To this end,
we proposed a novel exposure correction network, ExReg, to address the
challenges by formulating exposure correction as a multi-dimensional regression
process. Given an input image, a compact multi-exposure generation network is
introduced to generate images with different exposure conditions for
multi-dimensional regression and exposure correction in the next stage. An
auxiliary module is designed to predict the region-wise exposure values,
guiding the mainly proposed Encoder-Decoder ANP (Attentive Neural Processes) to
regress the final corrected image. The experimental results show that ExReg can
generate well-exposed results and outperform the SOTA method by 1.3dB in PSNR

judicious beamforming and power allocation. Unfortunately, the iterative nature
of the commonly applied optimization-based algorithms cannot meet the low
latency requirements due to the high computational complexity. For real-time
implementations, deep learning-based approaches, especially the graph neural
networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated with good scalability and
generalization performance due to the permutation equivariance (PE) property.
However, the current architectures are only equipped with the node-update
mechanism, which prohibits the applications to a more general setup, where the
unknown variables are also defined on the graph edges. To fill this gap, we
propose an edge-update mechanism, which enables GNNs to handle both node and
edge variables and prove its PE property with respect to both transmitters and
receivers. Simulation results on typical radio resource management problems
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher sum rate but with much
shorter computation time than state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well on
different numbers of base stations and users, different noise variances,
interference levels, and transmit power budgets.

astronomical signals from harmonics. I thus show on diverse data (geomagnetic

that many-body subharmonic entrainment induces Earth's resonant response to
astronomical forcing, so that 2{\pi}-phase-shifted axial precession p=26 ky and
its Pi=2{\pi}p/i; i=1,...n harmonics get resonantly responsible for paleodata

solving the radiative transport equation with effective radiative properties or
with statistical ray tracing techniques. While effective for static particles,
this approach is not compatible with the more common discrete formulation of
heat fluxes in particle flow systems. This study focuses on such a discrete
approach to compute radiative fluxes by developing view factors correlations.
Training data is generated from physics-based Monte Carlo ray tracing
simulations on a monodisperse, packed bed with solid volume fractions ranging
from 0.016 to 0.45. This data was used to develop reduced-order correlations to
determine particle-particle and particle-wall radiative view factors as a
function of particle-particle and particle-wall separation distance, viewing
angle, and the number of shading particles. Uniquely, we determine best-fit
functions that are physically interpretable to account for shading effects by
particles. A sigmoid function with a non-linear dependence on viewing angle
governs the extent of shading cast by an intermediate particle. To scale the
net contribution of shading by intermediate particles between a particle and a
planar wall, a particle-wall correction factor that is dependent quadratically
on the particle-wall normal separation distance serves to be effective. View
factor correlations result in reliable and reasonably accurate predictions. For
a solid volume fraction of 0.45, the root mean squared errors of
particle-particle and particle-wall view factors are 2.7e-4 and 0.021 with data
in the ranges of 0-0.08 and 0-0.5 respectively. With thousands of particles,
the computational cost of proposed correlations with thresholding of 5 shading
particles is about 100 times faster than serial Monte Carlo ray tracing
simulations for a solid volume fraction of 0.45.
