attention due to their ability to accurately localize, classify, and segment
objects from aerial images. These technologies are commonly used in unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution cameras or sensors to
capture data over large areas. This data is useful for various applications,
such as monitoring and inspecting cities, towns, and terrains. In this paper,
we presented a method for classifying and segmenting city road traffic dashed
lines from aerial images using deep learning models such as U-Net and SegNet.
The annotated data is used to train these models, which are then used to
classify and segment the aerial image into two classes: dashed lines and
non-dashed lines. However, the deep learning model may not be able to identify
all dashed lines due to poor painting or occlusion by trees or shadows. To
address this issue, we proposed a method to add missed lines to the
segmentation output. We also extracted the x and y coordinates of each dashed
line from the segmentation output, which can be used by city planners to
construct a CAD file for digital visualization of the roads.

[29] and present a large new class of examples. Our notion of nonlinear Markov
property is in McKean's spirit, but, in fact, more general in order to include
examples of such processes whose one-dimensional time marginal densities solve
a nonlinear parabolic PDE (more precisely, a nonlinear
Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation) such as Burgers' equation, the porous
media equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for all $d \geq 1$, or variants of the latter
with transport-type drift. We show that the associated nonlinear Markov process
is given by path laws of weak solutions to a corresponding
distribution-dependent stochastic differential equation whose coefficients
depend singularly (i.e. Nemytskii-type) on its one-dimensional time marginals.
We stress that for this the nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations do
not necessarily have to be well-posed. In particular, we prove that the
classical Barenblatt solutions to the porous media equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$,
$d \geq 1$, are one-dimensional time marginal densities of a nonlinear Markov
process. Moreover, we show that also for general nonlinear Markov processes,
their path laws are uniquely determined by one-dimensional time marginals of
suitable associated conditional path laws.

substantially reduce the average time increment between scanner transitions by
increasing the number of gates that can be performed for a single spatial light

in the context of polymer science, molecular biology, and puzzles. In this
paper, we focus on a simple type of fixed-angle linkage: every edge has unit
length (equilateral), and each joint has a fixed angle of $90^\circ$
(orthogonal) or $180^\circ$ (straight). When the linkage forms a path (open
chain), it always has a planar configuration, namely the zig-zag which
alternating the $90^\circ$ angles between left and right turns. But when the
linkage forms a cycle (closed chain), or is forced to lie in a box of fixed
size, we prove that the flattening problem -- deciding whether there is a
planar noncrossing configuration -- is strongly NP-complete.
  Back to open chains, we turn to the Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic (HP) model of
protein folding, where each vertex is labeled H or P, and the goal is to find a
folding that maximizes the number of H-H adjacencies. In the well-studied HP
model, the joint angles are not fixed. We introduce and analyze the fixed-angle
HP model, which is motivated by real-world proteins. We prove strong
NP-completeness of finding a planar noncrossing configuration of a fixed-angle
orthogonal equilateral open chain with the most H--H adjacencies, even if the
chain has only two H vertices. (Effectively, this lets us force the chain to be
closed.)

two temperature-driven Lifshitz transitions were inferred to exist in the Dirac
nodal-line semimetal ZrSiSe, based on two-band model analysis of the Hall
magnetoconductivities where the second band exhibits a change in the carrier
type from holes to electrons when the temperature decreases below T = 106 K and
a dip is observed in the mobility versus temperature curve at T = 80 K. Here,
we revisit the experiments and two-band model analysis on ZrSiSe. We show that
the anomalies in the second band may be spurious, because the first band
dominates the Hall magnetoconductivities at T > 80 K, making the carrier type
and mobility obtained for the second band from the two-band model analysis
unreliable. That is, care must be taken in interpreting these anomalies as
evidences for temperature-driven Lifshitz transitions. Our skepticism on the
existence of such phase transitions in ZrSiSe is further supported by the
validation of the Kohler's rule for magnetoresistances at temperatures below
180 K. This work showcases potential issues in interpreting anomalies in the

importance for the field of molecular electronics. This question is often
addressed within the paradigm of current-induced heating of nuclear degrees of
freedom or current-induced forces acting upon the nuclei. At the same time, an
essential characteristic of the failure of a molecular electronic device is its
changing conductance -- typically from a finite value for the intact device to
zero for a device that lost its functionality. In this publication, we focus on
the current-induced changes in the molecular conductance, which are inherent to
molecular junctions at the limit of mechanical stability. We employ a
numerically exact framework based on the hierarchical equations of motion
approach, which treats both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom on an
equal footing and does not impose additional assumptions. Studying generic
model systems for molecular junctions with dissociative potentials for a wide
range of parameters spanning the adiabatic and the nonadiabatic regime, we find
that molecular junctions that exhibit a decrease in conductance upon
dissociation are more stable than junctions that are more conducting in their
dissociated state. This represents a new mechanism that stabilizes molecular
junctions under current. Moreover, we identify characteristic signatures in the
current of breaking junctions related to the interplay between changes in the
conductance and the nuclear configuration and show how these are related to
properties of the leads rather than characteristics of the molecule itself.

average temperature of $T \sim 10$ keV. In addition to the cyclotron harmonics,
the BS Tri spectra contain Zeeman components of H$\alpha$ line, which are

the magnetic dipole and the coordinates of the accretion spot are estimated by
modeling the light curves of the polar. We show that for a satisfactory

  Solvers",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Linear partial differential equations (PDEs) are an important, widely applied
class of mechanistic models, describing physical processes such as heat
transfer, electromagnetism, and wave propagation. In practice, specialized
numerical methods based on discretization are used to solve PDEs. They
generally use an estimate of the unknown model parameters and, if available,
physical measurements for initialization. Such solvers are often embedded into
larger scientific models with a downstream application and thus error
quantification plays a key role. However, by ignoring parameter and measurement
uncertainty, classical PDE solvers may fail to produce consistent estimates of
their inherent approximation error. In this work, we approach this problem in a
principled fashion by interpreting solving linear PDEs as physics-informed
Gaussian process (GP) regression. Our framework is based on a key
generalization of the Gaussian process inference theorem to observations made
via an arbitrary bounded linear operator. Crucially, this probabilistic
viewpoint allows to (1) quantify the inherent discretization error; (2)
propagate uncertainty about the model parameters to the solution; and (3)
condition on noisy measurements. Demonstrating the strength of this
formulation, we prove that it strictly generalizes methods of weighted
residuals, a central class of PDE solvers including collocation, finite volume,
pseudospectral, and (generalized) Galerkin methods such as finite element and
spectral methods. This class can thus be directly equipped with a structured
error estimate. In summary, our results enable the seamless integration of
mechanistic models as modular building blocks into probabilistic models by
blurring the boundaries between numerical analysis and Bayesian inference.

criterion, then we use two different per-letter privacy constraints. In the
first scenario, an agent observes useful data $Y$ that is correlated with
private data $X$, and wishes to disclose the useful information to a user. A
privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data $U$ which maximizes
the revealed information about $Y$ while satisfying a bounded privacy leakage
constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the
private data. To this end, we first extend the Functional Representation Lemma
and Strong Functional Representation Lemma by relaxing the independence
condition and thereby allowing a certain leakage to find lower bounds for the
second scenario with different privacy leakage constraints. Furthermore, upper
and lower bounds are derived in the first scenario considering different
privacy constraints. In particular, for the case where no leakage is allowed,
our upper and lower bounds improve previous bounds. Moreover, considering

the variational approach to Markov processes (VAMP) to quantify the suitability

reduce high-dimensional reaction coordinates constructed from these CVs to
build Markov State Models (MSMs), which indicate that two barriers separate a
supersaturated fluid phase from crystals in the simulated environment. The MSMs
provide consistent estimates for crystal nucleation rates, regardless of the
dimensionality of the order parameter space adopted; however, the two-step
mechanism is only consistently evident from spectral clustering of the MSMs in
higher dimensions. As the method is general and easily transferable, the
variational approach we adopt could provide a useful framework to study
controls for crystal nucleation.

prediction (GNNLP) tasks. Existing efforts first predefine the subgraph for the
whole dataset and then apply GNNs to encode edge representations by leveraging
the neighborhood structure induced by the fixed subgraph. The prominence of
GNNLP methods significantly relies on the adhoc subgraph. Since node
connectivity in real-world graphs is complex, one shared subgraph is limited
for all edges. Thus, the choices of subgraphs should be personalized to
different edges. However, performing personalized subgraph selection is
nontrivial since the potential selection space grows exponentially to the scale
of edges. Besides, the inference edges are not available during training in
link prediction scenarios, so the selection process needs to be inductive. To
bridge the gap, we introduce a Personalized Subgraph Selector (PS2) as a
plug-and-play framework to automatically, personally, and inductively identify
optimal subgraphs for different edges when performing GNNLP. PS2 is
instantiated as a bi-level optimization problem that can be efficiently solved
differently. Coupling GNNLP models with PS2, we suggest a brand-new angle
towards GNNLP training: by first identifying the optimal subgraphs for edges;
and then focusing on training the inference model by using the sampled
subgraphs. Comprehensive experiments endorse the effectiveness of our proposed
method across various GNNLP backbones (GCN, GraphSage, NGCF, LightGCN, and
SEAL) and diverse benchmarks (Planetoid, OGB, and Recommendation datasets). Our

regularization of inverse imaging problems is introduced. The proposed method
employs estimates of the posterior variance together with techniques from
conformal prediction in order to obtain coverage guarantees for the error
bounds, without making any assumption on the underlying data distribution. It
is generally applicable to Bayesian regularization approaches, independent,
e.g., of the concrete choice of the prior. Furthermore, the coverage guarantees
can also be obtained in case only approximate sampling from the posterior is
possible. With this in particular, the proposed framework is able to
incorporate any learned prior in a black-box manner. Guaranteed coverage
without assumptions on the underlying distributions is only achievable since
the magnitude of the error bounds is, in general, unknown in advance.
Nevertheless, experiments with multiple regularization approaches presented in

framework relies on a backward learning procedure by restricting the induced
risk of the treatment rule to be no larger than a pre-specified risk constraint

medium, completed by the thermoelectrochemical (TEC) system, which consists of
the energy equation and the mass transport associated with electrochemical
reactions, where the fluxes are given by generalized Fourier, Fick and Ohm
laws, by including the Dufour--Soret and Peltier--Seebeck cross effects, in the
multidimensional domain. The present model includes macrohomogeneous models for
both hydrogen and methanol crossover. The novelty in the presented model lies
in the presence of the Joule effect into the Stokes/Darcy-TEC system altogether

parameters such as the viscosities and the diffusion coefficients, by the
concentration-temperature dependence of cross-effects coefficients, and by the
pressure dependence of the permeability. The purpose of the present work is to
derive quantitative estimates for solutions to explicit smallness conditions on
the data. We use fixed point and compactness arguments based on the
quantitative estimates of approximated solutions.

the prediction and the computation cost. In the last few years, the plans of
upgrading the configuration of the Integrated Forecast System of the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) from a single forecast with 9
km resolution and a 51-member ensemble with 18 km resolution induced an
extensive study of the forecast skill of both raw and post-processed
dual-resolution predictions comprising ensemble members of different horizontal
resolutions.
  We investigate the predictive performance of the censored shifted gamma (CSG)
ensemble model output statistic (EMOS) approach for statistical post-processing
with the help of dual-resolution 24h precipitation accumulation ensemble
forecasts over Europe with various forecast horizons. As high-resolution, the
operational 50-member ECMWF ensemble is considered, which is extended with a
200-member low-resolution (29-km grid) experimental forecast. The investigated
dual-resolution combinations consist of (possibly empty) subsets of these two
forecast ensembles with equal computational cost, being equivalent to the cost
of the operational 50-member ECMWF ensemble.
  Our case study verifies that, compared with the raw ensemble combinations,
EMOS post-processing results in a significant improvement in forecast skill and
the differences between the various dual-resolution combinations are reduced to
a non-significant level. Moreover, the semi-locally trained CSG EMOS is fully
able to catch up with the state-of-the-art quantile mapping and provides an
efficient alternative without requiring additional historical data essential in
determining the quantile maps.

generalized Toffoli gate on the five-level quantum systems, so-called ququints,
that uses ququints' space as the space of two qubits with a joint ancillary

controlled-phase gate. The proposed $N$-qubit Toffoli gate decomposition has
$O(N)$ asymptotic depth using no ancillary qubits. We then apply our results
for Grover's algorithm, where we indicate on the sizable advantage of the using
qudit-based approach with the proposed decomposition. We expect that our

propose a method to integrate trading on the continuous intraday market into a
multi-market optimization for flexible industrial energy systems. To estimate
the intraday market revenues, we employ option-price theory. Subsequently, a
multi-stage stochastic optimization determines an optimized bidding strategy

multi-energy system showing that coordinated bidding in all three considered

investigations of turbulence. This is also the case in the accretion disk
theory, where turbulence is considered to be responsible for the outward
transport of angular momentum in the accretion disk. In turbulent flows,
vortices transport momentum over their length scales providing the mechanism of
viscosity that is controlled by mass entrainment. We have earlier proposed an
entrainment model for the particular case of the relativistic jets in the radio
galaxy 3C31. In this paper, we further constrain the model parameters. The
model (in the non-relativistic part) is successfully tested versus experimental
and simulation data on the Reynolds stresses of free mixing layers and predicts
the Smagorinsky constant $C_\mathrm{S} \approx 0.11$, which is consistent with
the experimental range for shear flows $C_\mathrm{S} \approx 0.1-0.12$. For
accretion disks, the entrainment model allows us to derive the same accretion
mass rate as in the Shakura \& Sunyaev's $\alpha$-model without appealing to
the turbulent kinematic viscosity $\nu_\mathrm{t}$, and the viscosity parameter
$\alpha$ derived in the form $\displaystyle \alpha = -\frac{8}{3} \beta

observed in nature: from bird flocks, animals herds, ants and fish schools.
But, what happens when gregarious animals have to momentarily adopt an
individual behavior? To challenge the balance between herd and individual
behaviours, a school of Neons (Paracheirodon innesi) was forced to cross a
constriction. This experiment is reminiscent of panic crowd escaping through a
narrow door. Using statistical analysis developed for granular matter and
applied to crowd evacuation, our results show clearly that contrarily to human
crowds or herds of sheep, no clogging is formed at the bottleneck. Fish don't
collide and wait by respecting their social distance and a minimum waiting time
between two successive exits. When the constriction starts to be comparable to
or smaller than their social distance, individual domains fixed by this
cognitive distance are forced to deform and the fish density is increased. We
show that the current of escaping fish indeed behaves as a set of deformable
2D-bubbles, their 2D domain, through a constriction and obeys the same law.

we have access to a representative example of input data used during training

The mapping from deep ReLU networks to SNNs causes zero percent drop in

strings to achieve accurate shape sensing and direct kinematics of continuum
robots. Assuming general string routing, a methodical Lie group formulation for
the shape sensing of these robots is presented. The shape kinematics is
expressed using arc-length-dependent curvature distributions parameterized by
modal functions, and the Magnus expansion for Lie group integration is used to
express the shape as a product of exponentials. The tendon and string length
kinematic constraints are solved for the modal coefficients and the
configuration space and body Jacobian are derived. The noise amplification
index for the shape reconstruction problem is defined and used for optimizing
the string/tendon routing paths, and a planar simulation study shows the
minimal number of strings/tendons needed for accurate shape reconstruction. A
torsionally stiff continuum segment is used for experimental evaluation,
demonstrating mean (maximal) end-effector absolute position error of less than
2% (5%) of total length. Finally, a simulation study of a torsionally compliant
segment demonstrates the approach for general deflections and string routings.
We believe that the methods of this paper can benefit the design process,
sensing and control of continuum and soft robots.

Serre functor. Generalising the construction of $\mathscr{D}$ to other quivers
with relations which have a Serre functor results in the $Q$-shaped derived

Y. We employ density-functional theory with Hubbard corrections accounting not

transition-metals and the ligands ($V$). All the \textit{U} and \textit{V}

perturbation theory, resulting in a fully \emph{ab initio} methodology. Our
simulations show that the inclusion of the inter-site interaction parameters
$V$ is necessary to simultaneously capture the features well-established by
experimental characterizations of the low-temperature state: insulating
character, antiferromagnetism and bond disproportionation. On the contrary, for
some magnetic orderings the inclusion of on-site interaction parameters $U$
alone completely suppresses the breathing distortion occurring in the
low-temperature phase and produces an erroneous electronic state with a
vanishing band gap. In addition -- only when both the \textit{U} and \textit{V}
are considered -- we predict a polar phase with a magnetization-dependent
electric polarization, supporting very recent experimental observations that
suggest a possible occurrence of type-II multiferroicity for these materials.

learned from a small number of random samples from each class. Assuming that
the classes appearing in the data are selected independently from a

average few-shot error for the source classes. Additionally, we show that the

patterns prevail and, as such, it takes the network a long time to fully change

$\epsilon$ and $h$. More precisely, using tools from statistical physics, we
derive rigorous estimates in probability, expectation, and law for the first
hitting time between metastable (or stable) states and (other) stable states,

contemporary applied category theory to supply functorial semantics for
approximate inference. To do so, we define on the `syntactic' side the new
notion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian updating composes according to
the compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by
compositional game theory, we define categories of statistical games and use
them to classify various problems of statistical inference. On the `semantic'
side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems
(particularly: deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and
continuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show
collect into monoidal opindexed categories (or, alternatively, into algebras
for multicategories of generalized polynomial functors). We use these opindexed
categories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia: dynamical systems which
control lenses, and which supply the target for our functorial semantics.
Accordingly, we construct functors which explain the bidirectional
compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free
energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the
bidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to
compose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of
linear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses
and polynomial functors. Because category theory is unfamiliar to many
computational neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, we have made a
particular effort to give clear, detailed, and approachable expositions of all
the category-theoretic structures and results of which we make use.

their continuum limit. The celebrated example is graphene, whose continuum
limit is described by the Dirac equation on a Minkowski spacetime. Not only
does the continuum limit provide us with a dictionary of geometric observables
to describe the models with, but it also allows one to solve models that were
otherwise analytically intractable. In this thesis, we investigate novel
features of this relativistic description for a range of quantum lattice
models. In particular, we demonstrate how to generate emergent curved
spacetimes and identify observables at the lattice level which reveal this
emergent behaviour, allowing one to simulate relativistic effects in the
laboratory. We first study carbon nanotubes, a system with an edge, which
allows us to test the interesting feature of the Dirac equation that it allows
for bulk states with support on the edges of the system. We then study Kitaev's
honeycomb model which has a continuum limit describing Majorana spinors on a
Minkowski spacetime. We show how to generate a non-trivial metric in the
continuum limit of this model and how to observe the effects of this metric and
its corresponding curvature in the lattice observables, such as Majorana
correlators, Majorana zero modes and the spin densities. We also discuss how
lattice defects and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields at the lattice level can
generate chiral gauge fields in the continuum limit and we reveal their
adiabatic equivalence. Finally, we discuss a chiral modification of the 1D XY
model which makes the model interacting and introduces a non-trivial phase
diagram. We see that this generates a black hole metric in the continuum limit,
where the inside and outside of the black hole are in different phases. We then
demonstrate that by quenching this model we can simulate Hawking radiation.

revisiting the self-attention responses in Transformers, we empirically observe
two interesting issues. First, Vision Transformers present a queryirrelevant
behavior at deep layers, where the attention maps exhibit nearly consistent

above observations, we generalize self-attention formulation to abstract a
queryirrelevant global context directly and further integrate the global
context into convolutions. The resulting model, a Fully Convolutional Vision

stationary action profile. We envision a scenario where an external observer,
endowed with a learning procedure, is allowed to make queries and observe the
agents' reactions through private action-reaction mappings, whose collective
fixed point corresponds to a stationary profile. By adopting a smart query
process to iteratively collect sensible data and update parametric estimates,
we establish sufficient conditions to assess the asymptotic properties of the
proposed learning-based methodology so that, if convergence happens, it can
only be towards a stationary action profile. This fact yields two main
consequences: i) learning locally-exact surrogates of the action-reaction
mappings allows the external observer to succeed in its prediction task, and
ii) working with assumptions so general that a stationary profile is not even
guaranteed to exist, the established sufficient conditions hence act also as
certificates for the existence of such a desirable profile. Extensive numerical
simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision

been known to experience an intrinsic lateral compressive stress, originating
from chain elasticity and excluded volume interactions. This lateral stress
complicates a proper definition of the interface and, thereby, of the
interfacial tension. Moreover, its effect on wettability has remained unclear.
Here, we study the link between grafting-induced compressive lateral stress in
polymer brushes, interfacial tension, and brush wettability using
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. A central result is that the
liquid contact angle is independent of grafting density, which implies that the
strength of the compressive stress inside brush has no influence on the
wettability. Interestingly, though the interfacial tensions lack a proper
definition, the difference in interfacial tension between wet and dry brushes
is perfectly well-defined. We confirm explicitly from Young's law that this
difference offers an accurate description of the brush wettability. It is
demonstrated how these results can be explained from the fact that the
compressive stress appears ""symmetrically"" in wet and dry brushes. We discuss
our findings in the light of autophobic dewetting and point out the connection

different scenarios: three flavors with the standard Wolfenstein matter

Hamiltonians. We use a method for calculating the eigenvalues that is well
known, determination of the zeros of determinant of matrix $(\lambda I -H)$,
where H is the Hamiltonian, I the identity matrix and $\lambda$ is a scalar. To
calculate the associated eigenvectors we use a method that is little known in

the cofactor matrix) of the same matrix, $(\lambda I -H)$. This method can be
applied to any Hamiltonian, but provides a very simple way to determine the
eigenvectors for neutrino oscillation in matter, independent of the complexity
of the matter potential. This method can be trivially automated using the
Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm for numerical calculations. For the above scenarios
we derive a number of quantities that are invariant of the matter potential,
many are new such as the generalization of the Naumov-Harrison-Scott identity
for four or more flavors of neutrinos. We also show how these matter potential
independent quantities become matter potential dependent when off-diagonal

efficiency of photons highly depends on the choice of both parameters. The
exact focal plane position of the pump beam relative to those of the detection
modes is difficult to determine in a real experiment. Usually, theoretical and
experimental studies assume that the focal plane positions of the pump and the
generated beams are positioned in the center of the crystal. The displacement
of beam focal planes can lead to deviations from expected results and the
coupling efficiency into SMF can increase or decrease. In this work, we
consider variable positions of focal planes and investigate how shifts of these
focal planes influence the spatial and temporal properties of photon pairs. We
present SPDC arrangements, in which the knowledge of the exact position of the
focal planes is essential, as well as scenarios, where focal plane
displacements do not contribute significantly to experimental outcomes. These
findings are of particular interest for achieving higher efficiency in SPDC
experiments.

  Learning for Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification with Partial
  Observations",,,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A hybrid data assimilation algorithm is developed for complex dynamical
systems with partial observations. The method starts with applying a spectral
decomposition to the entire spatiotemporal fields, followed by creating a
machine learning model that builds a nonlinear map between the coefficients of
observed and unobserved state variables for each spectral mode. A cheap
low-order nonlinear stochastic parameterized extended Kalman filter (SPEKF)
model is employed as the forecast model in the ensemble Kalman filter to deal
with each mode associated with the observed variables. The resulting ensemble
members are then fed into the machine learning model to create an ensemble of
the corresponding unobserved variables. In addition to the ensemble spread, the
training residual in the machine learning-induced nonlinear map is further
incorporated into the state estimation that advances the quantification of the
posterior uncertainty. The hybrid data assimilation algorithm is applied to a
precipitating quasi-geostrophic (PQG) model, which includes the effects of
water vapor, clouds, and rainfall beyond the classical two-level QG model. The
complicated nonlinearities in the PQG equations prevent traditional methods
from building simple and accurate reduced-order forecast models. In contrast,
the SPEKF model is skillful in recovering the intermittent observed states, and
the machine learning model effectively estimates the chaotic unobserved
signals. Utilizing the calibrated SPEKF and machine learning models under a
moderate cloud fraction, the resulting hybrid data assimilation remains
reasonably accurate when applied to other geophysical scenarios with nearly
clear skies or relatively heavy rainfall, implying the robustness of the
algorithm for extrapolation.

  arXiv:2110.04058",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DP-coloring (or correspondence coloring) is a generalization of list coloring
that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and
Postle in 2015. As the analogue of the chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$,
$P(G,m)$, and the list color function, $P_{\ell}(G,m)$, the DP color function
of $G$, denoted by $P_{DP}(G,m)$, counts the minimum number of DP-colorings
over all possible $m$-fold covers. It follows that $P_{DP}(G,m) \le
P_{\ell}(G,m) \le P(G,m)$. A function $f$ is chromatic-adherent if for every
graph $G$, $f(G,a) = P(G,a)$ for some $a \geq \chi(G)$ implies that $f(G,m) =
P(G,m)$ for all $m \geq a$. It is known that the DP color function is not
chromatic-adherent, but there are only two known graphs that demonstrate this.
Suppose $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph and $\mathcal{H}$ is a 3-fold cover of $G$,
in this paper we associate with $\mathcal{H}$ a polynomial $f_{G, \mathcal{H}}
\in \mathbb{F}_3[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ so that the number of non-zeros of $f_{G,
\mathcal{H}}$ equals the number of $\mathcal{H}$-colorings of $G$. We then use
a well-known result of Alon and F\""{u}redi on the number of non-zeros of a
polynomial to establish a non-trivial lower bound on $P_{DP}(G,3)$ when $2n >
|E(G)|$. An easy consequence of this is that $P_{DP}(G, 3) \geq 3^{n/6}$ for
every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ of girth at least 5, improving the previously
known bounds on both $P_{DP}(G, 3)$ and $P_{\ell}(G, 3)$. Finally, we use this
bound to show that there are infinitely many graphs that demonstrate the
non-chromatic-adherence of the DP color function.

corresponding geodetic measures on a reference ellipsoid. Like their
ellipsoidal counterparts, the datumless measures quantify area and length in

from being purely theoretical, the datumless measures can be approximated in

information of a sample is gained by simultaneously capturing both the position
and momentum (angular) information of light illuminating a scene. Conventional
LFM designs generally require a trade-off between position and momentum
resolution, requiring one to sacrifice resolving power for increased depth of
field (DOF) or vice versa. In this work, we demonstrate a LFM design that does
not require this trade-off by utilizing the inherent correlations between
spatial-temporal entangled photon pairs. Here, one photon from the pair is used
to illuminate a sample from which the position information of the photon is
captured directly by a camera. By virtue of the strong momentum
anti-correlation between the two photons, the momentum information of the
illumination photon can then be inferred by measuring the angle of its
entangled partner on a different camera. By using a combination of ray-tracing
and a Gerchberg-Saxton type algorithm for the light field reconstruction, we
demonstrate that a resolving power of 5 $\mu$m can be maintained with a DOF of
$\sim500$ $\mu$m, approximately 3 times of the latest LFM designs or $>100$
time that of a conventional microscope. In the extreme, at a resolving power of

thus allows the estimation of all parameters in ANOVA regression. Second, it
provides the optimal parameter estimation in the sense of minimizing the
generalized variance of the estimated parameters. Third, the model trained on a
balanced subsample provides robust predictions in the sense of minimizing the
worst-case prediction error. We demonstrate the usefulness of the balanced
subsampling over existing data reduction methods in extensive simulation
studies and a real-world application.

as a consequence of the initial conditions for fundamental dynamic variables. A
formulation of the Euclidean quantum theory of gravity is also proposed to
determine the initial state, which can be the source of the universe's own

affects the geometry of space and forms a dedicated frame of reference. The
existence of selected reference systems is taken into account by the
corresponding modification of the system of quantum gravitational links. A
variant of such a modification of the Wheeler-De Witt equation is the operator

the universe, determines the parameters of the reference system in the form of
a distribution of the spinor field on a spatial section.

inviscid Euler flows on a periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^3$ may develop
singularities in a finite time. Our point of departure is the well-known result
by Kato (1972), which asserts the local existence of classical solutions to the
Euler system in the Sobolev space $H^m(\mathbb{T}^3)$ for $m > 5/2$. Thus,
potential formation of a singularity must be accompanied by an unbounded growth
of the $H^m$ norm of the velocity field as the singularity time is approached.
We perform a systematic search for ""extreme"" Euler flows that may realize such
a scenario by formulating and solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem
where the $H^3$ norm of the solution at a certain fixed time $T > 0$ is
maximized with respect to the initial data subject to suitable normalization
constraints. This problem is solved using a state-of-the-art Riemannian
conjugate gradient method where the gradient is obtained from solutions of an
adjoint system. Computations performed with increasing numerical resolutions
demonstrate that, as asserted by the theorem of Kato (1972), when the
optimization time window $[0, T]$ is sufficiently short, the $H^3$ norm remains
bounded in the extreme flows found by solving the optimization problem, which
indicates that the Euler system is well-posed on this ""short"" time interval. On
the other hand, when the window $[0, T]$ is long, possibly longer than the time
of the local existence asserted by Kato's theorem, then the $H^3$ norm of the
extreme flows diverges upon resolution refinement, which indicates a possible
singularity formulation on this ""long"" time interval. The extreme flow obtained
on the long time window has the form of two colliding vortex rings and is
characterized by certain symmetries. In particular, the region of the flow in
which a singularity might occur is nearly axisymmetric.

approximation of the normal bundle of the data manifold. This allows us to
estimate the dimension of the tangent space, thus, the intrinsic dimension of
the data manifold. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first

developed quantum technologies to date. The scenarios range from
proof-of-principle experiments to on-chip integration for quantum information
units. In most cases, these systems have operated in a regime where the
magnitude of the ion-radiation coupling constant is much smaller than the trap
and electronic transition frequencies. This regime allows the use of simple
effective Hamiltonians based on the validity of the rotating wave
approximation. However, novel trap and cavity designs now permit regimes in
which the trap frequency and the ion-radiation coupling constant are
commensurate. This opens up new venues for faster quantum gates and state
transfers from the ion to a photon, and other quantum operations. From the
theoretical side, however, there is not yet much known in terms of models and
applications that go beyond the weak driving scenario. In this work, we will
present two main results in the scenario of stronger drivings. First, we
revisit a known protocol to reconstruct the motional Wigner function and expand
it to stronger driving lasers. This extension is not trivial because the
original protocol makes use of effective Hamiltonians valid only for weak
drivings. The use of stronger fields or faster operations is desirable since
experimental reconstruction methods of that kind are usually hindered by
decoherence. We then present a model that allows the analytical treatment of
stronger drivings and that works well for non-resonant interactions, which are
generally out of the reach of the previous models.

Row Hammer to flip bits in neighboring rows (victim rows). A recent work,
called Randomized Row-Swap (RRS), proposed proactively swapping aggressor rows
with randomly selected rows before an aggressor row can cause Row Hammer.
  Our paper observes that RRS is neither secure nor scalable. We first propose
the `Juggernaut attack pattern' that breaks RRS in under 1 day. Juggernaut
exploits the fact that the mitigative action of RRS, a swap operation, can
itself induce additional target row activations, defeating such a defense.
Second, this paper proposes a new defense Secure Row-Swap mechanism that avoids
the additional activations from swap (and unswap) operations and protects
against Juggernaut. Furthermore, this paper extends Secure Row-Swap with attack
detection to defend against even future attacks. While this provides better
security, it also allows for securely reducing the frequency of swaps, thereby
enabling Scalable and Secure Row-Swap. The Scalable and Secure Row-Swap
mechanism provides years of Row Hammer protection with 3.3X lower storage
overheads as compared to the RRS design. It incurs only a 0.7% slowdown as

wave infrared (LWIR) images to increase the performance of object detection
machine learning (ML) models. Currently LWIR ML models have received less
research attention, especially for both ground- and air-based platforms,
leading to a lack of baseline performance metrics evaluating LWIR, RGB and
LWIR-RGB fused object detection models. Therefore, this research contributes
such quantitative metrics to the literature. The results found that the
ground-based blended RGB-LWIR model exhibited superior performance compared to
the RGB or LWIR approaches, achieving a mAP of 98.4%. Additionally, the blended
RGB-LWIR model was also the only object detection model to work in both day and
night conditions, providing superior operational capabilities. This research
additionally contributes a novel labelled training dataset of 12,600 images for
RGB, LWIR, and RGB-LWIR fused imagery, collected from ground-based and
air-based platforms, enabling further multispectral machine-driven object
detection research.

robots have shown huge potential for improving human productivity. These mobile
agents require low power/energy consumption to have a long lifespan since they
are usually powered by batteries. These agents also need to adapt to
changing/dynamic environments, especially when deployed in far or dangerous
locations, thus requiring efficient online learning capabilities. These
requirements can be fulfilled by employing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) since
SNNs offer low power/energy consumption due to sparse computations and
efficient online learning due to bio-inspired learning mechanisms. However, a
methodology is still required to employ appropriate SNN models on autonomous
mobile agents. Towards this, we propose a Mantis methodology to systematically
employ SNNs on autonomous mobile agents to enable energy-efficient processing
and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments. The key ideas of our Mantis
include the optimization of SNN operations, the employment of a bio-plausible
online learning mechanism, and the SNN model selection. The experimental
results demonstrate that our methodology maintains high accuracy with a
significantly smaller memory footprint and energy consumption (i.e., 3.32x
memory reduction and 2.9x energy saving for an SNN model with 8-bit weights)
compared to the baseline network with 32-bit weights. In this manner, our
Mantis enables the employment of SNNs for resource- and energy-constrained

  Neural Networks","Accepted in IEEE Big Data 22",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nowadays, fake news easily propagates through online social networks and
becomes a grand threat to individuals and society. Assessing the authenticity
of news is challenging due to its elaborately fabricated contents, making it
difficult to obtain large-scale annotations for fake news data. Due to such
data scarcity issues, detecting fake news tends to fail and overfit in the
supervised setting. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been adopted to
leverage the richer relational information among both labeled and unlabeled
instances. Despite their promising results, they are inherently focused on
pairwise relations between news, which can limit the expressive power for
capturing fake news that spreads in a group-level. For example, detecting fake
news can be more effective when we better understand relations between news
pieces shared among susceptible users. To address those issues, we propose to
leverage a hypergraph to represent group-wise interaction among news, while
focusing on important news relations with its dual-level attention mechanism.
Experiments based on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields
remarkable performance and maintains the high performance even with a small

spectral function from the first four spectral moments, which may be obtained
numerically efficiently within a \textit{moment-functional based spectral
density functional theory} (MFbSDFT). In order to obtain a suitable potential
for the second moment, one may use existing models of the uniform electron gas

Therefore, we show that reproducing the momentum distribution of the UEG within

the Langevin Diffusion run with some discretization stepsize $\eta > 0$. This
discretization leads the Langevin Algorithm to have a stationary distribution
$\pi_{\eta}$ which differs from the stationary distribution $\pi$ of the
Langevin Diffusion, and it is an important challenge to understand whether the
well-known properties of $\pi$ extend to $\pi_{\eta}$. In particular, while
concentration properties such as isoperimetry and rapidly decaying tails are
classically known for $\pi$, the analogous properties for $\pi_{\eta}$ are open
questions with direct algorithmic implications. This note provides a first step
in this direction by establishing concentration results for $\pi_{\eta}$ that
mirror classical results for $\pi$. Specifically, we show that for any
nontrivial stepsize $\eta > 0$, $\pi_{\eta}$ is sub-exponential (respectively,
sub-Gaussian) when the potential is convex (respectively, strongly convex).
Moreover, the concentration bounds we show are essentially tight.
  Key to our analysis is the use of a rotation-invariant moment generating
function (aka Bessel function) to study the stationary dynamics of the Langevin
Algorithm. This technique may be of independent interest because it enables
directly analyzing the discrete-time stationary distribution $\pi_{\eta}$
without going through the continuous-time stationary distribution $\pi$ as an
intermediary.

2DEG by charge transfer from bulk towards interface under strain. The
superconductivity, residing within the strained SNO layer near the interface,
is contributed by an electron system with record-low carrier density. Notably,
although embedded in a normal metallic layer with a carrier density 4 to 5
orders higher, the electron system is still uniquely well-protected to retain
high mobility and lies deep in extreme quantum regime.

challenge, we introduce the notion of a matrix measure flow. Given a matrix
flow, a matrix measure flow captures the evolution of an associated matrix
measure (or logarithmic norm). We show that for certain matrix flows of
interest in computational neuroscience, the associated matrix measure flow
obeys a simple inequality. This inequality can be used in turn to infer the
stability and contraction properties of recurrent neural networks with plastic
synapses. We consider examples of synapses undergoing Hebbian and/or
Anti-Hebbian plasticity, as well as covariance-based and gradient-based rules.

mathematically expressing conservations of mass, momentum and energy. The
advantage of the NS equations over the Euler equations is that the NS equations
have taken into account the viscous stress caused by the thermal motion of
molecules. The viscous stress arises from applying Isaac Newton's second law to
fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress is proportional to
the gradient of velocity1. Thus, the assumption is the only empirical element
in the NS equations, and this is actually the reason why the NS equations
perform poorly under special circumstances. For example, the NS equations
cannot describe rarefied gas flows and shock structure. This work proposed a
correction to the NS equations with an argument that the viscous stress is
proportional to the gradient of momentum when the flow is under compression,
with zero additional empirical parameters. For the first time, the NS equations
have been capable of accurately solving shock structure and rarefied gas flows.
In addition, even for perfect gas, the accuracy of the prediction of heat flux
rate is greatly improved. The corrected NS equations can readily be used to
improve the accuracy in the computation of flows with density variations which
is common in nature.

While heuristics to develop an ideal class order have been researched, this

a neural network is trained on the full data first, and a statistical test for
the residuals is conducted to find the best split, corresponding to the two
sub-regions with the most significant uncertainty heterogeneity. USNRT is
computationally friendly because very few leaf nodes are sufficient and pruning
is unnecessary. On extensive UCI datasets, in terms of both calibration and
sharpness, USNRT shows superior performance compared to some recent popular
methods for variance prediction, including vanilla variance network, deep
ensemble, dropout-based methods, tree-based models, etc. Through comprehensive
visualization and analysis, we uncover how USNRT works and show its merits.

with the hypothesis that unfettered access to memory is not fundamentally

result is a system called MProtect that leverages a small piece of software
running at a higher privilege level than the OS. MProtect protects the entire
user space of a process, requires only a small modification to the OS, and
supports major architectures such as ARM, x86 and RISC-V. Unlike prior works
that resorted to nested virtualization, which is often undesirable in mobile

handles exceptions. We report an implementation of MProtect called MGuard with

caching,'' in \textit{IEEE Inf. Theory Workshop (ITW)}, 2021] The problem
setting consists of a central server having a library of $N$ files and $C$
caches each of capacity $M$. Each user in the system can access a unique set of
$r<C$ caches, and there exist users corresponding to every distinct set of $r$
caches. Therefore, the number of users in the system is $\binom{C}{r}$. For the
aforementioned combinatorial multi-access setting, we propose a coded caching
scheme with an MDS code-based coded placement. This novel placement technique
helps to achieve a better rate in the delivery phase compared to the optimal
scheme under uncoded placement, when $M> N/C$. For a lower memory regime, we
present another scheme with coded placement, which outperforms the optimal
scheme under uncoded placement if the number of files is no more than the
number of users. Further, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the
optimal rate-memory trade-off of the combinatorial multi-access coded caching

is optimal in the higher memory regime, and the second scheme is optimal if

  time-varying setting",,,,,"q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The estimation of market impact is crucial for measuring the information
content of trades and for transaction cost analysis. Hasbrouck's (1991) seminal
paper proposed a Structural-VAR (S-VAR) to jointly model mid-quote changes and
trade signs. Recent literature has highlighted some pitfalls of this approach:
S-VAR models can be misspecified when the impact function has a non-linear
relationship with the trade sign, and they lack parsimony when they are
designed to capture the long memory of the order flow. Finally, the
instantaneous impact of a trade is constant, while market liquidity highly
fluctuates in time. This paper fixes these limitations by extending Hasbrouck's
approach in several directions. We consider a nonlinear model where we use a
parsimonious parametrization allowing to consider hundreds of past lags.
Moreover we adopt an observation driven approach to model the time-varying
impact parameter, which adapts to market information flow and can be easily
estimated from market data. As a consequence of the non-linear specification of
the dynamics, the trade information content is conditional both on the local
level of liquidity, as modeled by the dynamic instantaneous impact coefficient,
and on the state of the market. By analyzing NASDAQ data, we find that impact
follows a clear intra-day pattern and quickly reacts to pre-scheduled
announcements, such as those released by the FOMC. We show that this fact has
relevant consequences for transaction cost analysis by deriving an expression
for the permanent impact from the model parameters and connecting it with the
standard regression procedure. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical analyses
support the reliability of our approach, which exploits the complete
information of tick-by-tick prices and trade signs without the need for
aggregation on a macroscopic time scale.

single quantum processing unit (QPU) can be extended through distributed
quantum computing (DQC), in which one can implement global operations over two
QPUs by entanglement-assisted local operations and classical communication. To
facilitate this type of DQC in experiments, we need an entanglement-efficient
protocol. To this end, we extend the gate teleportation protocol implementing
each controlled-unitary gate with one maximally entangled pair [Eisert et. al.,
PRA, 62:052317(2000)] to a packing protocol, which can pack multiple
controlled-unitary gates locally using one maximally entangled pair. In
particular, two types of packing processes are introduced as the building
blocks, namely the distributing processes and embedding processes. Each
distributing process distributes corresponding gates locally with one entangled
pair. The efficiency of entanglement is then enhanced by embedding processes,
which merge two non-sequential distributing processes and hence save the
entanglement cost. We show that the structure of distributability and
embeddability of a quantum circuit can be fully represented by the
corresponding packing graphs and conflict graphs. Based on these graphs, we
derive heuristic algorithms for finding an entanglement-efficient packing of
distributing processes for a given quantum circuit to be implemented by two
parties. These algorithms can determine the required number of local auxiliary
qubits in the DQC. We apply these algorithms for bipartite DQC of unitary
coupled-cluster circuits and find a significant reduction of entanglement cost
through embeddings. This method can determine a constructive upper bound on the
entanglement cost for the DQC of quantum circuits.

approach has two shortcomings: first, we need to explicitly know the set of
optimal test functions; and second, the optimal test functions may have large
supports inducing expensive dense linear systems. Nevertheless, parametric
families of PDEs are an example where it is worth investing some (offline)
computational effort to obtain stabilized linear systems that can be solved
efficiently, for a given set of parameters, in an online stage. Therefore, as a
remedy for the first shortcoming, we explicitly compute (offline) a function
mapping any PDE-parameter, to the matrix of coefficients of optimal test
functions (in a basis expansion) associated with that PDE-parameter. Next, as a
remedy for the second shortcoming, we use the low-rank approximation to
hierarchically compress the (non-square) matrix of coefficients of optimal test
functions. In order to accelerate this process, we train a neural network to
learn a critical bottleneck of the compression algorithm (for a given set of
PDE-parameters). When solving online the resulting (compressed) Petrov-Galerkin
formulation, we employ a GMRES iterative solver with inexpensive matrix-vector
multiplications thanks to the low-rank features of the compressed matrix. We
perform experiments showing that the full online procedure as fast as the
original (unstable) Galerkin approach. In other words, we get the stabilization

encompasses a stage of strain localization and is epitomized by the growth of
lithospheric-scale shear bands. Our aim in this paper, using a solid-mechanical
constitutive description relevant for oceanic lithosphere, is to investigate
factors that promote or inhibit localization of deformation in brittle and
ductile regimes in convergence-driven numerical experiments. We used the
Drucker-Prager yield criterion and a non-associative flow rule, allowing
viscoplastic deformation to take directions independent of the preferred
direction of yield. We present a step-by-step description of the constitutive
law and the consistent algorithmic tangent modulus. The model domain contains
an initial weak-zone on which localization can potentially nucleate. In solving
the energy conservation problem, we incorporate a heat source term from the
mechanical deformations which embodies the irreversible plastic work done. This
work term couples the energy equation to the constitutive description, and
hence hence the stress balance, via the evolving temperature field. On a
sample-scale, we first conduct a series of isothermal benchmark tests. We then
explore behavior including shear heating and volumetric work both separately
and in concert. and thereby address the (in)significance of the latter, and
hence assess their potential importance. We find that dilatational effects
mostly enhance both shear band development and shear heating. We also observe
that high temperature promotes shear band development whereas high confining
pressure inhibits it, and infer that the competition between these factors is
likely to be the major influence on the position within the lithosphere where
shear bands nucleate.

holding or selling of individual stocks affects other stocks in nonlinear and
collaborative ways that cannot be always captured using succinct models. Such
complexity arises due to several latent and confounding factors, such as
variations in decision making because of incomplete information, and differing
short/long-term objectives of traders. While few emergent phenomena such as
seasonality and fractal behaviors in individual stock price data have been
reported, universal scaling laws that apply collectively to the market are
rare. In this paper, we consider the market-mode adjusted pairwise correlations
of returns over different time scales ($\tau$), $c_{i,j}(\tau)$, and discover
two such novel emergent phenomena: (i) the standard deviation of the
$c_{i,j}(\tau)$'s scales as $\tau^{-\lambda}$, for $\tau$ larger than a certain
return horizon, $\tau_0$, where $\lambda$ is the scaling exponent, (ii)
moreover, the scaled and zero-shifted distributions of the $c_{i,j}(\tau)$'s
are invariant of $\tau > \tau_0$. Our analysis of S\&P500 market data collected
over almost $20$ years ($2004-2020$) demonstrates that the twin scaling
property holds for each year and across $2$ decades (orders of magnitude) of
$\tau$. Moreover, we find that the scaling exponent $\lambda$ provides a
summary view of market volatility: in years marked by unprecedented financial
crises -- for example $2008$ and $2020$ -- values of $\lambda$ are
substantially higher. As for analytical modeling, we demonstrate that such
scaling behaviors observed in data cannot be explained by existing theoretical
frameworks such as the single- and multi-factor models. To close this gap, we
introduce a promising agent-based model -- inspired by literature on swarming
-- that displays more of the emergent behaviors exhibited by the real market

structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for optimal
scheduling of the system to achieve the minimum overall estimation mean-square
error (MSE). In particular, we propose a structure-enhanced action selection
method, which tends to select actions that obey the policy structure. This
explores the action space more effectively and enhances the learning efficiency
of DRL agents. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-enhanced loss function to
add penalties to actions that do not follow the policy structure. The new loss
function guides the DRL to converge to the optimal policy structure quickly.
Our numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed structure-enhanced DRL

the behavior of frictional faults, embedded in either elastic or inelastic
mediums, and submitted to a far field loading (seismic cycle models), or
initial stresses (single dynamic rupture models). Those initial conditions
impact both on-fault and off-fault dynamics. Because of the sparsity of direct
measurements of fault stresses, modelers have to make assumptions about these
initial conditions. To this day, Anderson's theory is the only framework that
can be used to link fault generation and reactivation to the three-dimensional
stress field. In this work we look at the role of the three dimensional stress
field in modelling a 2D strike-slip fault under plane-strain conditions. We
show that setting up the incorrect initial stress field, based on Anderson's
theory, can lead to underestimation of the damage zone width by up to a factor
of six, for the studied cases. Moreover, because of the interactions between
fault slip and off-fault deformation, initial stress field influences the
rupture propagation. Our study emphasizes the need to set up the correct
initial 3D stress field, even in 2D numerical simulations.

heterogeneity at the clients. One pathway to understanding the drastic accuracy
drop in federated learning is by scrutinizing the behavior of the clients' deep
models on data with different levels of ""difficulty"", which has been left
unaddressed. In this paper, we investigate a different and rarely studied
dimension of FL: ordered learning. Specifically, we aim to investigate how
ordered learning principles can contribute to alleviating the heterogeneity
effects in FL. We present theoretical analysis and conduct extensive empirical
studies on the efficacy of orderings spanning three kinds of learning:
curriculum, anti-curriculum, and random curriculum. We find that curriculum
learning largely alleviates non-IIDness. Interestingly, the more disparate the
data distributions across clients the more they benefit from ordered learning.
We provide analysis explaining this phenomenon, specifically indicating how
curriculum training appears to make the objective landscape progressively less
convex, suggesting fast converging iterations at the beginning of the training
procedure. We derive quantitative results of convergence for both convex and
nonconvex objectives by modeling the curriculum training on federated devices
as local SGD with locally biased stochastic gradients. Also, inspired by
ordered learning, we propose a novel client selection technique that benefits
from the real-world disparity in the clients. Our proposed approach to client
selection has a synergic effect when applied together with ordered learning in
FL.

synthesis of structural and semantic representations. The structural
representation is obtained by meta-path-based sampling and a skip-gram-based

ultrahigh fields. In this work, we proposed a double cross magnetic wall
decoupling for quadrature transceiver RF arrays and implemented the decoupling
method on common-mode differential mode quadrature (CMDM) quadrature
transceiver arrays at ultrahigh field of 7T. The proposed magnetic decoupling
wall comprised of two intrinsic decoupled loops is used to reduce the mutual

novel 3D reconstruction method called Polarimetric Multi-View Inverse Rendering
(Polarimetric MVIR) that effectively exploits geometric, photometric, and
polarimetric cues extracted from input multi-view color-polarization images. We
first estimate camera poses and an initial 3D model by geometric reconstruction
with a standard structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo pipeline. We then
refine the initial model by optimizing photometric rendering errors and
polarimetric errors using multi-view RGB, AoP, and DoP images, where we propose
a novel polarimetric cost function that enables an effective constraint on the
estimated surface normal of each vertex, while considering four possible
ambiguous azimuth angles revealed from the AoP measurement. The weight for the
polarimetric cost is effectively determined based on the DoP measurement, which
is regarded as the reliability of polarimetric information. Experimental
results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our Polarimetric
MVIR can reconstruct a detailed 3D shape without assuming a specific surface

involves the resolution of a system of partial differential equations (PDE).
These problems make difficult to develop a real-time prediction tool.
Therefore, in this work, we propose using machine learning in conjunction with
(complementarily cheaper) single-phase flow numerical simulations in the
presence of tangential discontinuities to estimate the mixing process in
two-phase flows. In this meaning we study the application of two proposed
neural network (NN) models as PDE surrogate models. Where the future dynamics
is predicted by the NN, given some preliminary information. We show the low
computational cost required by these models, both in their training and
inference phases. We also show how NN training can be improved by reducing data
complexity through a modal decomposition technique called higher order dynamic
mode decomposition (HODMD), which identifies the main structures inside flow
dynamics and reconstructs the original flow using only these main structures.
This reconstruction has the same number of samples and spatial dimension as the
original flow, but with a less complex dynamics and preserving its main
features. The core idea of this work is to test the limits of applicability of
deep learning models to data forecasting in complex fluid dynamics problems.
Generalization capabilities of the models are demonstrated by using the same NN

various analysis tasks on graph data. A key premise for the remarkable
performance of GNNs relies on complete and trustworthy initial graph
descriptions (i.e., node features and graph structure), which is often not
satisfied since real-world graphs are often incomplete due to various
unavoidable factors. In particular, GNNs face greater challenges when both node
features and graph structure are incomplete at the same time. The existing
methods either focus on feature completion or structure completion. They
usually rely on the matching relationship between features and structure, or
employ joint learning of node representation and feature (or structure)
completion in the hope of achieving mutual benefit. However, recent studies
confirm that the mutual interference between features and structure leads to
the degradation of GNN performance. When both features and structure are
incomplete, the mismatch between features and structure caused by the missing
randomness exacerbates the interference between the two, which may trigger
incorrect completions that negatively affect node representation. To this end,
in this paper we propose a general GNN framework based on teacher-student
distillation to improve the performance of GNNs on incomplete graphs, namely
T2-GNN. To avoid the interference between features and structure, we separately
design feature-level and structure-level teacher models to provide targeted
guidance for student model (base GNNs, such as GCN) through distillation. Then
we design two personalized methods to obtain well-trained feature and structure
teachers. To ensure that the knowledge of the teacher model is comprehensively
and effectively distilled to the student model, we further propose a dual
distillation mode to enable the student to acquire as much expert knowledge as
possible.

transmission capability around kinematic singularity configurations. Here, we
harness the elastic potential energy of a linear spring attached to the coupler

parameter space for proper force transmission in slider-crank and rocker-crank

process of gadget discovery develops in three stages: First, we use an RL agent
to generate data, then, we employ a mining algorithm to extract gadgets and
finally, the obtained gadgets are grouped by a density-based clustering
algorithm. We demonstrate our method by applying it to two quantum-inspired RL

design of high-dimensional multipartite entangled states where the algorithm
finds gadgets that correspond to modern interferometer setups. Second, we
consider a circuit-based quantum computing environment where the algorithm
discovers various gadgets for quantum information processing, such as quantum

radial velocity measurements from the CORAVEL data base. We confirm that HD
213258 is definitely an Ap star. We found that, in its spectrum, the Fe II
{\lambda}6149.2 {\AA} line is resolved into its two magnetically split
components. The mean magnetic field modulus of HD 213258, <B> ~ 3.8 kG does not
show significant variations over ~2 years. Comparing our mean longitudinal
field determinations with a couple of measurements from the literature, we show
that the stellar rotation period must likely be of the order of 50 years, with
a reversal of the field polarity. Moreover, HD 213258 is a rapidly oscillating
Ap (roAp) star, in which high overtone pulsations with a period of 7.58 min are
detected. Finally, we confirm that HD 213258 has a mean radial velocity
exceeding (in absolute value) that of at least 99% of the Ap stars. The radial
velocity shows low amplitude variations, which suggests that the star is a
single-line spectroscopic binary. It is also a known astrometric binary. While
its orbital elements remain to be determined, its orbital period likely is one
of the shortest known for a binary roAp star. Its secondary is close to the
borderline between stellar and substellar objects. There is a significant
probability that it may be a brown dwarf. While most of the above-mentioned
properties, taken in isolation, are observed in a small fraction of the whole
population of Ap stars, the probability that a single star possesses all of
them is extremely low. This makes HD 213258 an exceptionally interesting object
that deserves to be studied in detail in the future.

secret state at all. We show that Bernoulli honeywords enable analytic
derivation of false breach-detection probabilities irrespective of what
information the attacker gathers about the sites' users; that their true and
false breach-detection probabilities demonstrate compelling efficacy; and that
Bernoulli honeywords can even enable performance improvements in modern

on the physiological structure of the muscle, The simulation calculations would
be natural, and also, It can be possible to analyze human movement using
reverse engineering methods. The model is also a suitable choice to be used in
modern prostheses, because the calculation of the model is less than other
machine learning models such as artificial neural network algorithms and It
makes our algorithm battery-friendly. We will also devise a method that can
calculate the intensity of human muscle during gait cycle using a reverse
engineering solution. The algorithm called Boots is different from some
optimization methods, so It would be able to compute the activities of both
agonist and antagonist muscles in a joint. As a consequence, By having an
agent-based model of human muscle and Boots algorithm, We would be capable to
develop software that can calculate the nervous stimulation of human's lower
body muscle based on the angular displacement during gait cycle without using
painful methods like electromyography. By developing the application as
open-source software, We are hopeful to help researchers and physicians who are
studying in medical and biomechanical fields.

empirical performance and excellent theoretical properties such as model
selection consistency and (near) minimax posterior contraction rates. In this
paper, the normal-compound gamma prior (NCG) resulting from compounding on the
respective inverse-scale parameters with gamma distribution is used as a prior
for the scale parameter. Attractiveness of this model becomes apparent due to
its relationship to various useful models. The tuning of the hyperparameters
gives the same shrinkage properties exhibited by some other models. Using
different sets of conditions, the posterior is shown to be both strongly
consistent and have nearly-optimal contraction rates depending on the set of
assumptions. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) and Variational
Bayes algorithms are derived, then a method is proposed for updating the
hyperparameters and is incorporated into the MCMC and Variational Bayes
algorithms. Finally, empirical evidence of the attractiveness of this model is
demonstrated using both real and simulated data, to compare the predicted
results with previous models.

overhead building damage detection, but the competition's pixel level scoring
can lead to reduced solution performance in areas with tight clusters of
buildings or uninformative context. We seek to advance automatic building
damage assessment for disaster relief by proposing an auxiliary challenge to
the original xView2 competition. This new challenge involves a new dataset and
metrics indicating solution performance when damage is more local and limited
than in xBD. Our challenge measures a network's ability to identify individual
buildings and their damage level without excessive reliance on the buildings'
surroundings. Methods that succeed on this challenge will provide more
fine-grained, precise damage information than original xView2 solutions. The
best-performing xView2 networks' performances dropped noticeably in our new
limited/local damage detection task. The common causes of failure observed are
that (1) building objects and their classifications are not separated well, and
(2) when they are, the classification is strongly biased by surrounding
buildings and other damage context. Thus, we release our augmented version of
the dataset with additional object-level scoring metrics
(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VuQZuAg6-Yo8r5J4OCx3ZRpa_fv9aaDX?usp=sharing)
to test independence and separability of building objects, alongside the
pixel-level performance metrics of the original competition. We also experiment
with new baseline models which improve independence and separability of
building damage predictions. Our results indicate that building damage
detection is not a fully-solved problem, and we invite others to use and build
on our dataset augmentations and metrics.

Twitter users to discover interesting content from the deluge of uninteresting
posts. In this work, we present a novel, explainable, topical recommendation
system, that utilizes social annotations, to help Twitter users discover
tweets, on topics of their interest. A major challenge in using traditional
rating dependent recommendation systems, like collaborative filtering and
content based systems, in high volume social networks is that, due to attention
scarcity most items do not get any ratings. Additionally, the fact that most
Twitter users are passive consumers, with 44% users never tweeting, makes it
very difficult to use user ratings for generating recommendations. Further, a
key challenge in developing recommendation systems is that in many cases users
reject relevant recommendations if they are totally unfamiliar with the
recommended item. Providing a suitable explanation, for why the item is
recommended, significantly improves the acceptability of recommendation. By
virtue of being a topical recommendation system our method is able to present
simple topical explanations for the generated recommendations. Comparisons with
state-of-the-art matrix factorization based collaborative filtering, content
based and social recommendations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
approach.

  Network and Variational Mode Decomposition",,,,,"q-fin.ST cs.CE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Financial time series prediction, a growing research topic, has attracted
considerable interest from scholars, and several approaches have been
developed. Among them, decomposition-based methods have achieved promising
results. Most decomposition-based methods approximate a single function, which
is insufficient for obtaining accurate results. Moreover, most existing
researches have concentrated on one-step-ahead forecasting that prevents stock
market investors from arriving at the best decisions for the future. This study
proposes two novel methods for multi-step-ahead stock price prediction based on
the issues outlined. DCT-MFRFNN, a method based on discrete cosine transform
(DCT) and multi-functional recurrent fuzzy neural network (MFRFNN), uses DCT to
reduce fluctuations in the time series and simplify its structure and MFRFNN to
predict the stock price. VMD-MFRFNN, an approach based on variational mode
decomposition (VMD) and MFRFNN, brings together their advantages. VMD-MFRFNN
consists of two phases. The input signal is decomposed to several IMFs using
VMD in the decomposition phase. In the prediction and reconstruction phase,
each of the IMFs is given to a separate MFRFNN for prediction, and predicted
signals are summed to reconstruct the output. Three financial time series,
including Hang Seng Index (HSI), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Standard &
Poor's 500 Index (SPX), are used for the evaluation of the proposed methods.
Experimental results indicate that VMD-MFRFNN surpasses other state-of-the-art
methods. VMD-MFRFNN, on average, shows 35.93%, 24.88%, and 34.59% decreases in
RMSE from the second-best model for HSI, SSE, and SPX, respectively. Also,
DCT-MFRFNN outperforms MFRFNN in all experiments.

government scientific procedures that inform and shape policy. Many governments
implemented COVID quarantine (stay-at-home) orders on the notion that this
nonpharmaceutical intervention would delay and flatten the epidemic peak and
largely benefit public health outcomes. The overall research capacity response
to COVID since late 2019 has been massive. Given lack of research transparency,
only a small fraction of published research has been judged by others to be
reproducible before COVID. Independent evaluation of published meta-analysis on
a common research question can be used to assess the reproducibility of a claim
coming from that field of research. We used a p-value plotting statistical
method to independently evaluate reproducibility of specific research claims
made in four meta-analysis studies related to benefits/risks of COVID
quarantine orders. Outcomes we investigated included: mortality, mental health
symptoms, incidence of domestic violence, and suicidal ideation (thoughts of
killing yourself). Three of the four meta-analyses that we evaluated
(mortality, mental health symptoms, incidence of domestic violence) raise
further questions about benefits/risks of this form of intervention. The fourth
meta-analysis study (suicidal ideation) is unreliable. Given lack of research
transparency and irreproducibility of published research, independent
evaluation of meta-analysis studies using p-value plotting is offered as a way
to strengthen or refute (falsify) claims made in COVID research.
