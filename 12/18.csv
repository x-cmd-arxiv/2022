  https://github.com/IvanWang0730/StyleAP",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Controlling styles in neural machine translation (NMT) has attracted wide
attention, as it is crucial for enhancing user experience. Earlier studies on
this topic typically concentrate on regulating the level of formality and
achieve some progress in this area. However, they still encounter two major
challenges. The first is the difficulty in style evaluation. The style
comprises various aspects such as lexis, syntax, and others that provide
abundant information. Nevertheless, only formality has been thoroughly
investigated. The second challenge involves excessive dependence on incremental
adjustments, particularly when new styles are necessary. To address both
challenges, this paper presents a new benchmark and approach. A multiway
stylized machine translation (MSMT) benchmark is introduced, incorporating
diverse categories of styles across four linguistic domains. Then, we propose a
method named style activation prompt (StyleAP) by retrieving prompts from
stylized monolingual corpus, which does not require extra fine-tuning.
Experiments show that StyleAP could effectively control the style of
translation and achieve remarkable performance.

temperature (HPHT) has been investigated by combining HPHT experiments and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Starting from beta rhombohedral
or amorphous boron and amorphous carbon at 5 GPa, the alpha boron phase has
been repeatedly observed between 1473 K and 2273 K, at temperatures that are
much higher than those reported in the phase diagram of boron. The DFT
investigation of the effect of carbon insertion into the alpha rhombohedral
boron atomic structure on the formation enthalpy, volume and optical properties
shows that only the (B11C) substituted icosahedron defect accounts for the
slight volume contraction observed in {\alpha} boron. It is also compatible
with the observed red colour of {\alpha} boron crystals, and consistently has a
very low formation energy. Our calculations also provide a calibration tool to
evaluate the carbon concentration in the samples. Finally, the synthesis
temperature is found to be an easy means to tune the carbon concentration on
demand.

pre-training on data for speech recognition and machine translation is

adapts the speech features with a new shrinking mechanism to mitigate the
length mismatch between speech and text features by predicting word boundaries.
Experiments on the MUST-C dataset demonstrate that AdaTranS achieves better
performance than the other shrinking-based methods, with higher inference speed
and lower memory usage. Further experiments also show that AdaTranS can be
equipped with additional alignment losses to further improve performance.

autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection, semantic map construction,
motion forecasting, and depth estimation. Nevertheless, the latency of
vision-centric approaches is too high for practical deployment (e.g., most
camera-based 3D detectors have a runtime greater than 300ms). To bridge the gap
between ideal research and real-world applications, it is necessary to quantify
the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Traditionally,
autonomous-driving perception benchmarks perform the offline evaluation,
neglecting the inference time delay. To mitigate the problem, we propose the
Autonomous-driving StreAming Perception (ASAP) benchmark, which is the first
benchmark to evaluate the online performance of vision-centric perception in
autonomous driving. On the basis of the 2Hz annotated nuScenes dataset, we
first propose an annotation-extending pipeline to generate high-frame-rate
labels for the 12Hz raw images. Referring to the practical deployment, the
Streaming Perception Under constRained-computation (SPUR) evaluation protocol
is further constructed, where the 12Hz inputs are utilized for streaming
evaluation under the constraints of different computational resources. In the
ASAP benchmark, comprehensive experiment results reveal that the model rank
alters under different constraints, suggesting that the model latency and

practical deployment. To facilitate further research, we establish baselines
for camera-based streaming 3D detection, which consistently enhance the

condensate and replacing it by ""excited"" collective pairs built on
time-reversed single-particle orbits. The second type of zero seniority excited
states is described by a condensate of identical excited pairs. The structure
of these excited states is analysed for the picked fence model and for the
valence neutrons of $^{108}$Sn. For a state-depending pairing interaction, the
first type of excited states agree well with the J=0 states which are known in
$^{108}$Sn. At the same time, these states can be also associated unambiguously
with those exact states which are the closest in energy to the experimental
levels. The states corresponding to the excited pair condensate appear at low
energies, around the energy of the second excited state of the first type, and
they do not have a simple correspondence with exact eigenstates. However, at a
much higher excitation energy there is an exact state which is similar in
structure to an EPC state. It is shown that this EPC state has the features of
a giant pairing vibration.

for $\kappa$. One of them leads us to a very intuitive estimator of
$\kappa$(X,Y) that is a nice function of four naturally arising U-statistics.
We derive the exact finite sample relation between all three estimates. The
asymptotic distribution of our estimator, and hence also of the other two
estimators, in the non-null (dependence) case, is then obtained by using the
U-statistics central limit theorem. For specific parametric bivariate
distributions, the value of $\kappa$ can be derived in terms of the natural
dependence parameters of these distributions. In particular, we derive the
formula for $\kappa$ when (X,Y) are distributed as Gumbel's bivariate
exponential. We bring out various aspects of these estimators through extensive
simulations from several prominent bivariate distributions. In particular, we
investigate the empirical relationship between $\kappa$ and the dependence
parameters, the distributional properties of the estimators, and the accuracy

shown in Cuckovic, Stessin, Tchernev (2021) that if $G$ is a non-special
Coxeter group of type $A,B$, or $D$, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are two linear

Coxeter generators of $G$ under $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ coincide as divisors in

therefore, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are equivalent. In Peebles, Stessin, Tchernev

Coxeter groups of types $B,C$, and $D$. It was shown there that each such group

equal. Notably, the affine Coxeter groups of $A$ type are not covered by this
result, as their combinatorics is quite different.mIn this paper we explicitly
construct a finite set in $\tilde{A}_n$ having the same property. We also show
that every group which is a semidirect product of a fine group and a finitely

every finite-dimensonal representation of the group, the determinantal

pair of instances but also triplets. Then, these factors are utilized to
jointly predict labels of all instances. To address the intractability problem
of exact high-order inference, we incorporate a high-order neural decoder that
is unfolded from a mean-field variational inference method, which achieves
consistent learning and inference. The experimental results show that our
approach achieves consistent improvements on three IE tasks compared with our

applications. Unfortunately, appropriately selecting hyperparameters is
challenging in federated networks. Issues of scale, privacy, and heterogeneity
introduce noise in the tuning process and make it difficult to evaluate the
performance of various hyperparameters. In this work, we perform the first
systematic study on the effect of noisy evaluation in federated hyperparameter
tuning. We first identify and rigorously explore key sources of noise,
including client subsampling, data and systems heterogeneity, and data privacy.
Surprisingly, our results indicate that even small amounts of noise can
significantly impact tuning methods-reducing the performance of
state-of-the-art approaches to that of naive baselines. To address noisy
evaluation in such scenarios, we propose a simple and effective approach that
leverages public proxy data to boost the evaluation signal. Our work
establishes general challenges, baselines, and best practices for future work
in federated hyperparameter tuning.

exhibit singularities which reflect various aspects of the cluster algebras
associated to the Grassmannians ${\rm Gr}(4,n)$ and their tropical
counterparts. Here we investigate the potential origins of such structures and
examine the extent to which they can be recovered from the Gr\""obner structure
of the underlying Pl\""ucker ideals, focussing on the Grassmannians
corresponding to finite cluster algebras.
  Starting from the Pl\""ucker ideal, we describe how the polynomial cluster
variables are encoded in non-prime initial ideals associated to certain maximal
cones of the positive tropical fan. Following [1] we show that extending the
Pl\""ucker ideal by such variables leads to a Gr\""obner fan with a single
maximal Gr\""obner cone spanned by the positive tropical rays. The associated
initial ideal encodes the compatibility relations among the full set of cluster
variables. Thus we find that the Gr\""obner structure naturally encodes both the
symbol alphabet and the cluster adjacency relations exhibited by scattering
amplitudes without invoking the cluster algebra at all.
  As a potential application of these ideas we then examine the kinematic ideal
associated to non-dual conformal massless scattering written in terms of spinor
helicity variables. For five-particle scattering we find that the ideal can be
identified with the Pl\""ucker ideal for ${\rm Gr}(3,6)$ and the corresponding
tropical fan contains a number of non-prime ideals which encode all additional
letters of the two-loop pentagon function alphabet present in various
calculations of massless five-point finite remainders.

approach with active learning of the disturbances. Our approach holds the dual
property of handling the two tasks simultaneously and iteratively: (i) learn
the disturbances affecting the system and (ii) drive the system output towards
a reference trajectory. Particularly, we model nonlinear system dynamics using
a specialized neural network (SNN). This SNN formulates the disturbances via
the designed additive and multiplicative disturbance components. We consider
both additive and multiplicative disturbances for precise description and
recognition of disturbance profile. We achieve the disturbance recognition in
the SNN via the design of a Bayesian-based active learning approach, which
allows the disturbance learning to be decoupled from the control law
derivation. Such a decoupling contributes to the control robustness in the
existence of varying and abrupt disturbances. We derive the dual control law
based on the active learning of the SNN, and validate our approach via one-time
and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate a fast disturbance
recognition by our method in real-time and the robustness of control of unknown
systems with abrupt disturbances. We evaluate our approach on the speed control
of high-speed train, and the results manifest efficient control of the train
speed with disturbance resilience, without prior knowledge about the train
dynamics and the disturbances imposed on the train. We openly released the code

constructing arbitrarily nonlinear manifold approximations for nonlinear model
reduction that exploited one form or another of ANN, the training of the

with that of the high-dimensional model; and this PROM-ANN is hyperreducible
using any well-established hyperreduction method. Hence, unlike many other

practical for large-scale and industry-relevant CFD problems. Its potential is
demonstrated here for a parametric, shock-dominated, benchmark problem.

promise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date

neural decompilers have achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring
language-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an
abstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the
overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to
the extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text,
and show that this allows us to build a decompiler that is easily retargetable

tokenization and training data selection on the quality of decompilation,
finding that it achieves comparable decompilation results to prior work in

shown that it is ionized by young stars, we have determined the gas oxygen
abundance by using conventional strong-line calibration methods. We have
inspected the gas kinematics in the ring with Fabry-Perot interferometer data
obtained at the William Herschel Telescope. The pattern and properties of the
brightest star formation regions are studied with the tunable filter MaNGaL at
the 2.5m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg
Astronomical Institute (CMO SAI MSU). The gas metallicity in the ring is
certainly subsolar, [O/H]$=-0.4 \pm 0.1$~dex, that is different from the
majority of the outer starforming rings in S0s studied by us which have
typically nearly solar metallicity. The total stellar component of the galaxy
which is old in the center is less massive than its extended gaseous disk. We
conclude that probably the ring and the outer disk of UGC~4599 are a result of
gas accretion from a cosmological filament.

obstacles, pushing objects, crawling under a table, pushing a door open with

  We propose a GPU fine-grained load-balancing abstraction that decouples load
balancing from work processing and aims to support both static and dynamic
schedules with a programmable interface to implement new load-balancing
schedules. Prior to our work, the only way to unleash the GPU's potential on
irregular problems has been to workload-balance through application-specific,
tightly coupled load-balancing techniques. With our open-source framework for
load-balancing, we hope to improve programmers' productivity when developing
irregular-parallel algorithms on the GPU, and also improve the overall
performance characteristics for such applications by allowing a quick path to
experimentation with a variety of existing load-balancing techniques.
  Using our insights from load-balancing irregular workloads, we build
Stream-K, a work-centric parallelization of matrix multiplication (GEMM) and
related computations in dense linear algebra. Whereas contemporary
decompositions are primarily tile-based, our method operates by partitioning an
even share of the aggregate inner loop iterations among physical processing
elements. This provides a near-perfect utilization of computing resources,
regardless of how efficiently the output tiling for any given problem quantizes
across the underlying processing elements. On GPU processors, our Stream-K
parallelization of GEMM produces a peak speedup of up to 14x and 6.7x, and an
average performance response that is both higher and more consistent across 32K

neural networks that learn from large training datasets, PiNNs only leverage
the strong form mathematical models to simultaneously solve for multiple

pressure) and their derivatives (i.e., velocity). Several case studies are
designed with the intention of investigating the proposed PiNN's capability to
handle different degrees of complexity. A manual hyperparameter tuning method
is used to find the best PiNN architecture for each test case. Point-wise error

decoupled independent environments fail to capture the coupled dynamics in a
networked microgrid, which leads us to propose a multi-agent vertically
federated variation of actor-critic algorithms, namely federated soft
actor-critic (FedSAC) algorithm. We created a customized simulation setup
encapsulating microgrid dynamics in the GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform

stable preferences for syntactically acceptable content over minimal-pair
unacceptable inputs. Most targeted syntactic evaluation datasets ask models to
make these judgements with just a single context-free sentence as input. This
does not match language models' training regime, in which input sentences are
always highly contextualized by the surrounding corpus. This mismatch raises an
important question: how robust are models' syntactic judgements in different
contexts? In this paper, we investigate the stability of language models'
performance on targeted syntactic evaluations as we vary properties of the
input context: the length of the context, the types of syntactic phenomena it
contains, and whether or not there are violations of grammaticality. We find
that model judgements are generally robust when placed in randomly sampled
linguistic contexts. However, they are substantially unstable for contexts
containing syntactic structures matching those in the critical test content.
Among all tested models (GPT-2 and five variants of OPT), we significantly
improve models' judgements by providing contexts with matching syntactic
structures, and conversely significantly worsen them using unacceptable
contexts with matching but violated syntactic structures. This effect is
amplified by the length of the context, except for unrelated inputs. We show
that these changes in model performance are not explainable by simple features
matching the context and the test inputs, such as lexical overlap and
dependency overlap. This sensitivity to highly specific syntactic features of
the context can only be explained by the models' implicit in-context learning
abilities.

Causality Layered Architecture), which combines multiple levels of categorical
abstraction for causal inference. At the top-most level, causal interventions
are modeled combinatorially using a simplicial category of ordinal numbers. At
the second layer, causal models are defined by a graph-type category. The
non-random ``surgical"" operations on causal structures, such as edge deletion,
are captured using degeneracy and face operators from the simplicial layer
above. The third categorical abstraction layer corresponds to the data layer in
causal inference. The fourth homotopy layer comprises of additional structure
imposed on the instance layer above, such as a topological space, which enables
evaluating causal models on datasets. Functors map between every pair of layers
in UCLA. Each functor between layers is characterized by a universal arrow,
which defines an isomorphism between every pair of categorical layers. These
universal arrows define universal elements and representations through the
Yoneda Lemma, and in turn lead to a new category of elements based on a
construction introduced by Grothendieck. Causal inference between each pair of

different types of fibrations. We illustrate the UCLA architecture using a
range of examples, including integer-valued multisets that represent a

on graphs and string diagrams using symmetric monoidal categories. We define
causal effect in terms of the homotopy colimit of the nerve of the category of

enhancement is the limited availability of high-quality training data.
Underwater images are difficult to capture and are often of poor quality due to
the distortion and loss of colour and contrast in water. This makes it
difficult to train supervised deep learning models on large and diverse
datasets, which can limit the model's performance. In this paper, we explore an
alternative approach to supervised underwater image enhancement. Specifically,
we propose a novel unsupervised underwater image enhancement framework that
employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to train a deep learning
model with probabilistic adaptive instance normalization (PAdaIN) and
statistically guided multi-colour space stretch that produces realistic
underwater images. The resulting framework is composed of a U-Net as a feature
extractor and a PAdaIN to encode the uncertainty, which we call UDnet. To
improve the visual quality of the images generated by UDnet, we use a
statistically guided multi-colour space stretch module that ensures visual
consistency with the input image and provides an alternative to training using
a ground truth image. The proposed model does not need manual human annotation
and can learn with a limited amount of data and achieves state-of-the-art
results on underwater images. We evaluated our proposed framework on eight
publicly-available datasets. The results show that our proposed framework
yields competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches in
quantitative as well as qualitative metrics. Code available at

collection of lightweight adapters. The shared encoder captures the general
knowledge of dialogues across domains, while each adapter specializes in one
specific domain and serves as a domain expert. To validate the idea, we
construct a high-quality multi-domain dialogue dataset leveraging data
augmentation and pseudo-labeling. The PoE network is comprehensively assessed
on 16 dialogue evaluation datasets spanning a wide range of dialogue domains.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean Spearman correlation
over all the evaluation datasets. It exhibits better zero-shot generalization
than existing state-of-the-art ADEMs and the ability to easily adapt to new
domains with few-shot transfer learning.

multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL). Existing multi-instance learning

MIPL problems since the former fail to disambiguate a candidate label set, and
the latter cannot handle a multi-instance bag. To address these issues, a

classifier that is provably robust to $\ell_2$-adversarial perturbations, viz.,
by averaging its predictions over the noise via randomized smoothing. Under the
smoothed classifiers, the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and
(adversarial) robustness has been well evidenced in the literature: i.e.,
increasing the robustness of a classifier for an input can be at the expense of
decreased accuracy for some other inputs. In this paper, we propose a simple
training method leveraging this trade-off to obtain robust smoothed
classifiers, in particular, through a sample-wise control of robustness over
the training samples. We make this control feasible by using ""accuracy under
Gaussian noise"" as an easy-to-compute proxy of adversarial robustness for an

proxy to filter out samples that are unlikely to benefit from the worst-case
(adversarial) objective. Our experiments show that the proposed method, despite
its simplicity, consistently exhibits improved certified robustness upon
state-of-the-art training methods. Somewhat surprisingly, we find these
improvements persist even for other notions of robustness, e.g., to various
types of common corruptions.

varying Weber number at moderate Reynolds numbers. A simplified chemical
reaction mechanism is used for combustion modelling. The Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) results show a net positive effect of Weber number on total
evaporation rate ($\dot{m}$) for both pure evaporation and combustion cases.
The enhancement in $\dot{m}$ for higher Weber number reaches upto 9% for
combustion. A non-spherical envelope flame is observed which grows with time.
The Damk\""{o}hler number is higher than 1 for this flame type which leads to
faster reaction rates in comparison to evaporation. Hence, the combustion
process is seen to be unaffected by droplet shape. An additional comparison
between 3-D and 2-D combustion results is performed to understand if 2-D
studies can reflect the right physical aspects of this problem. It is found
that local evaporation flux in 2-D is 42.5 % lower due to lower temperature
gradients near the droplet surface for the same inflow velocity. The
deformation of droplet is significantly different in 2-D which affects the
boundary layer development and the wake flow. This is seen to affect the flame
shape at the downstream of droplet. Hence, the 2-D simulations do not recover

state plays an essential role in observing macroscopic quantum effects in

protocol in cavity magnomechanics that is able to cool the mechanical vibration
mode of a macroscopic ferromagnet into its ground state. The mechanical mode
couples to a magnon mode via a dispersive magnetostrictive interaction, and the
latter further couples to a microwave cavity mode via the magnetic-dipole
interaction. A feedback loop is introduced by measuring the amplitude of the
microwave cavity output field and applying a force onto the mechanical
oscillator that is proportional to the amplitude fluctuation of the output
field. We show that by properly designing the feedback gain, the mechanical
damping rate can be significantly enhanced while the mechanical frequency
remains unaffected. Consequently, the vibration mode can be cooled into its
quantum ground state in the unresolved-sideband regime at cryogenic
temperatures. The protocol is designed for cavity magnomechanical systems using
ferromagnetic materials which possess strong magnetostriction along with large
magnon dissipation.

the costs of non-treatment exceed those of treatment for a subpopulation, to be
factored into the budget. It also accommodates simpler settings, such as
quantity constraints, and doesn't require outcome responses and costs to have
the same unit of measurement. Importantly, the approach accounts for settings
where budget or resource limitations may preclude treating all that can
benefit, where costs may vary with individual characteristics, and where there
may be uncertainty regarding the cost of treatment rules of interest. Despite
the nomenclature, our theoretical analysis examines frequentist properties of

derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for the target population costs and
sharp oracle-type inequalities that compare the rules' welfare regret to that

inference can be unnecessarily conservative if this set includes many questions
that were unlikely to be asked in the first place. We introduce a less
conservative solution to selective inference that we call locally simultaneous
inference, which only answers those questions that could plausibly have been
asked in light of the observed data, all the while preserving rigorous type I
error guarantees. For example, if the objective is to construct a confidence
interval for the ""winning"" treatment effect in a clinical trial with multiple
treatments, and it is obvious in hindsight that only one treatment had a chance
to win, then our approach will return an interval that is nearly the same as
the uncorrected, standard interval. Under mild conditions satisfied by common

simultaneous inference, meaning it can never yield less statistical power but

the electric fields. The numerical results show that with the increase of the
electric field, the transmission coefficient decreases, and the Seebeck
coefficient changes. The effect of a perpendicular electric field on the
Seebeck coefficient is weaker than a transverse electric field. For an applied
transverse electric field of 0.3 V/nm, the maximum Seebeck coefficient enhances
to 2.09 mV/K.

we are the first to use a GCN model in child activity recognition domain. In
overcoming the challenges of having small size publicly available child action
datasets, several learning methods such as feature extraction, fine-tuning and
curriculum learning were implemented to improve the model performance. Inspired
by the contradicting claims made on the use of transfer learning in CAR, we
conducted a detailed implementation and analysis on transfer learning together
with a study on negative transfer learning effect on CAR as it hasn't been
addressed previously. As the principal contribution, we were able to develop a
ST-GCN based CAR model which, despite the small size of the dataset, obtained
around 50% accuracy on vanilla implementations. With feature extraction and
fine-tuning methods, accuracy was improved by 20%-30% with the highest accuracy
being 82.24%. Furthermore, the results provided on activity datasets
empirically demonstrate that with careful selection of pre-train model datasets
through methods such as curriculum learning could enhance the accuracy levels.
Finally, we provide preliminary evidence on possible frame rate effect on the
accuracy of CAR models, a direction future research can explore.

decisions. However, big data is stored in massive databases that are difficult
to retrieve. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) is a technique for providing
approximate answers to aggregate queries based on a summary of the data
(synopsis) that closely replicates the behavior of the actual data, which can
be useful where an approximate answer to the queries would be acceptable in a
fraction of the real execution time. In this paper, we discuss the use of
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating tabular data that can be
employed in AQP for synopsis construction. We first discuss the challenges
associated with constructing synopses in relational databases and then
introduce solutions to those challenges. Following that, we organized
statistical metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated synopses. We
conclude that tabular data complexity makes it difficult for algorithms to
understand relational database semantics during training, and improved versions
of tabular GANs are capable of constructing synopses to revolutionize
data-driven decision-making systems.

prioritisation is the process of ranking the (unordered) set of retrieved

rooted at a source site, we suggest keeping one or more distance triples, for
each triangle, that may help determine the Voronoi bisectors when one uses a

squared distance to characterize the linear change of distance field restricted
in a triangle, which is proved to induce an exact VD when the base surface
reduces to a planar triangle mesh. Specially, our algorithm also supports the
Euclidean distance, which can handle thin-sheet models (e.g. leaf) and runs
faster than the traditional restricted Voronoi diagram~(RVD) algorithm. It is
very extensible to deal with various variants of surface-based Voronoi diagrams

marketplaces, social media, and search engines. Traditionally, ranking systems
only focus on how to get better relevance estimation. When relevance estimation
is available, they usually adopt a user-centric optimization strategy where
ranked lists are generated by sorting items according to their estimated
relevance. However, such user-centric optimization ignores the fact that item
providers also draw utility from ranking systems. It has been shown in existing
research that such user-centric optimization will cause much unfairness to item
providers, followed by unfair opportunities and unfair economic gains for item
providers.
  To address ranking fairness, many fair ranking methods have been proposed.
However, as we show in this paper, these methods could be suboptimal as they
directly rely on the relevance estimation without being aware of the
uncertainty (i.e., the variance of the estimated relevance). To address this
uncertainty, we propose a novel Marginal-Certainty-aware Fair algorithm named
MCFair. MCFair jointly optimizes fairness and user utility, while relevance
estimation is constantly updated in an online manner.
  In MCFair, we first develop a ranking objective that includes uncertainty,
fairness, and user utility. Then we directly use the gradient of the ranking
objective as the ranking score. We theoretically prove that MCFair based on
gradients is optimal for the aforementioned ranking objective. Empirically, we
find that on semi-synthesized datasets, MCFair is effective and practical and
can deliver superior performance compared to state-of-the-art fair ranking
methods. To facilitate reproducibility, we release our code

deal with various input/output features when specified with different

policy optimization to learn a goal-conditioned state planner; then, distills a
goal-planner to plan immediate landmarks in a model-free style that can be
shared among different agents. In our experiments, we show the power of PILoT
on various transferring challenges, including few-shot transferring across

from simple robot to complicated morphology; and we also illustrate a zero-shot

  Bridging GNNs and MLPs","Accepted to ICLR 2023. Codes in https://github.com/chr26195/PMLP",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph neural networks (GNNs), as the de-facto model class for representation
learning on graphs, are built upon the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
architecture with additional message passing layers to allow features to flow
across nodes. While conventional wisdom commonly attributes the success of GNNs
to their advanced expressivity, we conjecture that this is not the main cause
of GNNs' superiority in node-level prediction tasks. This paper pinpoints the
major source of GNNs' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization
capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as
P(ropagational)MLP, which is identical to standard MLP in training, but then
adopts GNN's architecture in testing. Intriguingly, we observe that PMLPs
consistently perform on par with (or even exceed) their GNN counterparts, while
being much more efficient in training. This finding sheds new insights into
understanding the learning behavior of GNNs, and can be used as an analytic
tool for dissecting various GNN-related research problems. As an initial step
to analyze the inherent generalizability of GNNs, we show the essential
difference between MLP and PMLP at infinite-width limit lies in the NTK feature
map in the post-training stage. Moreover, by examining their extrapolation
behavior, we find that though many GNNs and their PMLP counterparts cannot
extrapolate non-linear functions for extremely out-of-distribution samples,
they have greater potential to generalize to testing samples near the training
data range as natural advantages of GNN architectures.

error bound for black-box targeted attacks, which gives a rigorous theoretical
analysis for guaranteeing the success of the attack. We reveal that the attack
error on a target model mainly depends on empirical attack error on the
substitute model and the maximum model discrepancy among substitute models. On
the algorithmic side, we derive a new algorithm for black-box targeted attacks
based on our theoretical analysis, in which we additionally minimize the
maximum model discrepancy(M3D) of the substitute models when training the
generator to generate adversarial examples. In this way, our model is capable
of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples that are robust to the
model variation, thus improving the success rate for attacking the black-box

world's largest single-dish radio telescope. Its large reflecting surface
achieves unprecedented sensitivity but is prone to damage, such as dents and
holes, caused by naturally-occurring falling objects. Hence, the timely and
accurate detection of surface defects is crucial for FAST's stable operation.
Conventional manual inspection involves human inspectors climbing up and
examining the large surface visually, a time-consuming and potentially
unreliable process. To accelerate the inspection process and increase its
accuracy, this work makes the first step towards automating the inspection of
FAST by integrating deep-learning techniques with drone technology. First, a
drone flies over the surface along a predetermined route. Since surface defects
significantly vary in scale and show high inter-class similarity, directly
applying existing deep detectors to detect defects on the drone imagery is
highly prone to missing and misidentifying defects. As a remedy, we introduce
cross-fusion, a dedicated plug-in operation for deep detectors that enables the
adaptive fusion of multi-level features in a point-wise selective fashion,
depending on local defect patterns. Consequently, strong semantics and
fine-grained details are dynamically fused at different positions to support
the accurate detection of defects of various scales and types. Our AI-powered
drone-based automated inspection is time-efficient, reliable, and has good
accessibility, which guarantees the long-term and stable operation of FAST.

measure this ``distance'' by the ratio of the systemic temperature $\Ts$ to
$\Tc$, where $\Ts$ is the canonical-ensemble temperature for which the average
potential energy is equal to that of the active-matter system. $\Tc$ is
``local'' in the sense that it is the average of a function, which only depends
on how the potential energy varies in the vicinity of a given configuration; in
contrast $\Ts$ is a global quantity. The quantity $\Ts/\Tc$ is straightforward
to evaluate in a computer simulation; equilibrium simulations in conjunction
with a single steady-state active-matter configuration are enough to determine
$\Ts/\Tc$. We validate the suggestion that $\Ts/\Tc$ quantifies the deviation
from thermal equilibrium by data for the radial distribution function of 3d
Kob-Andersen and 2d Yukawa active-matter models with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

Inference of 3-D shape is a difficult task, especially when only silhouettes
are provided in a dataset. We provide a method for learning 3-D body inference
from silhouettes by transferring knowledge from 3-D shape prior from RGB

example, the two-photon cascaded emission from calcium atoms was used in
pioneering experiments to test Bell inequalities. In solid-state quantum
optics, the radiative biexciton-exciton cascade has proven useful to generate
entangled-photon pairs. More recently, correlations and entanglement of
microwave photons emitted from a two-photon cascaded process were measured
using superconducting circuits. All these experiments rely on the highly
non-linear nature of the underlying energy ladder, enabling direct excitation
and probing of specific single-photon transitions. Here, we use exciton
polaritons to explore the cascaded emission of photons in the regime where
individual transitions of the ladder are not resolved, a regime that has not
been addressed so far. We excite a polariton quantum cascade by off-resonant
laser excitation and probe the emitted luminescence using a combination of
spectral filtering and correlation spectroscopy. Remarkably, the measured
photon-photon correlations exhibit a strong dependence on the polariton energy,
and therefore on the underlying polaritonic interaction strength, with clear
signatures from two- and three-body Feshbach resonances. Our experiment
establishes photon-cascade correlation spectroscopy as a highly sensitive tool
to provide valuable information about the underlying quantum properties of
novel semiconductor materials and we predict its usefulness in view of studying
many-body quantum phenomena.

from unwanted listeners via the physical layer. In this work, we consider the
problem of perfect covert communication in wireless networks. Specifically,
harnessing an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), we turn our attention to
schemes which allow the transmitter to completely hide the communication, with
zero energy at the unwanted listener (Willie) and hence zero probability of
detection. Applications of such schemes go beyond simple covertness, as we
prevent detectability or decoding even when the codebook, timings and channel
characteristics are known to Willie. That is, perfect covertness also ensures
Willie is unable to decode, even assuming communication took place and knowing
the codebook. We define perfect covertness, give a necessary and sufficient
condition for it in IRS-assisted communication and define the optimization
problem. For N = 2 IRS elements, we analyze the probability of finding a
solution and derive its closed-form. We then investigate the problem of N > 2
IRS elements, by analyzing probability of such a zero-detection solution. We
prove that this probability converge to 1 as the number of IRS tends to
infinity. We provide an iterative algorithm to find a perfectly covert scheme
and prove its convergence. The results are also supported by simulations,
showing that a small amount of IRS elements allows for a positive rate at the
legitimate user yet with zero probability of detection at an unwanted listener.

  of a Neighbourhood Watch",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Neighbourhood watch is a concept that allows a community to distribute a
complex security task in between all members. Members of the community carry
out individual security tasks to contribute to the overall security of it. It
reduces the workload of a particular individual while securing all members and
allowing them to carry out a multitude of security tasks. Wireless sensor
networks (WSNs) are composed of resource-constraint independent battery driven
computers as nodes communicating wirelessly. Security in WSNs is essential.
Without sufficient security, an attacker is able to eavesdrop the
communication, tamper monitoring results or deny critical nodes providing their
service in a way to cut off larger network parts. The resource-constraint
nature of sensor nodes prevents them from running full-fledged security
protocols. Instead, it is necessary to assess the most significant security
threats and implement specialised protocols. A neighbourhood-watch inspired
distributed security scheme for WSNs has been introduced by Langend\""orfer. Its
goal is to increase the variety of attacks a WSN can fend off. A framework of
such complexity has to be designed in multiple steps. Here, we introduce an
approach to determine distributions of security means on large-scale static
homogeneous WSNs. Therefore, we model WSNs as undirected graphs in which two
nodes connected iff they are in transmission range. The framework aims to
partition the graph into $n$ distinct security means resulting in the targeted
distribution. The underlying problems turn out to be NP hard and we attempt to
solve them using linear programs (LPs). To evaluate the computability of the
LPs, we generate large numbers of random {\lambda}-precision unit disk graphs
(UDGs) as representation of WSNs. For this purpose, we introduce a novel
{\lambda}-precision UDG generator to model WSNs with a minimal distance in
between nodes.

result, different studies select different versions of datasets to evaluate
their methods, which makes ASTE-related works hard to follow. In this paper, we
analyze the relation between different versions of datasets and suggest that
the entire-space version should be used for ASTE. Besides the sentences
containing triplets and the triplets in the sentences, the entire-space version
additionally includes the sentences without triplets and the aspect terms which
do not belong to any triplets. Hence, the entire-space version is consistent
with real-world scenarios and evaluating models on the entire-space version can
better reflect the models' performance in real-world scenarios. In addition,
experimental results show that evaluating models on non-entire-space datasets
inflates the performance of existing models and models trained on the
entire-space version can obtain better performance.

language, vision, speech, and audio domains over the past few years. While
discrete label prediction is widely adopted for other modalities, the
state-of-the-art audio SSL models still employ reconstruction loss for
pre-training. Compared with reconstruction loss, semantic-rich discrete label
prediction encourages the SSL model to abstract the high-level audio semantics
and discard the redundant details as in human perception. However, a
semantic-rich acoustic tokenizer for general audio pre-training is usually not
straightforward to obtain, due to the continuous property of audio and
unavailable phoneme sequences like speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose
BEATs, an iterative audio pre-training framework to learn Bidirectional Encoder
representation from Audio Transformers, where an acoustic tokenizer and an
audio SSL model are optimized by iterations. In the first iteration, we use
random projection as the acoustic tokenizer to train an audio SSL model in a
mask and label prediction manner. Then, we train an acoustic tokenizer for the
next iteration by distilling the semantic knowledge from the pre-trained or
fine-tuned audio SSL model. The iteration is repeated with the hope of mutual
promotion of the acoustic tokenizer and audio SSL model. The experimental
results demonstrate our acoustic tokenizers can generate discrete labels with
rich audio semantics and our audio SSL models achieve state-of-the-art results
across various audio classification benchmarks, even outperforming previous
models that use more training data and model parameters significantly.
Specifically, we set a new state-of-the-art mAP 50.6% on AudioSet-2M for
audio-only models without using any external data, and 98.1% accuracy on

operads from a freely generated operad into a certain ""operad of spliced
words"". This motivates a more general notion of CFG over any category $C$,
defined as a finite species $S$ equipped with a color denoting the start symbol
and a functor of operads $p : Free[S] \to W[C]$ into the operad of spliced
arrows in $C$. We show that many standard properties of CFGs can be formulated
within this framework, and that usual closure properties of CF languages
generalize to CF languages of arrows. We also discuss a dual fibrational
perspective on the functor $p$ via the notion of ""displayed"" operad,
corresponding to a lax functor of operads $W[C] \to Span(Set)$.
  We then turn to the Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger Representation Theorem. We
describe how a non-deterministic finite state automaton can be seen as a
category $Q$ equipped with a pair of objects denoting initial and accepting
states and a functor of categories $Q \to C$ satisfying the unique lifting of
factorizations property and the finite fiber property. Then, we explain how to
extend this notion of automaton to functors of operads, which generalize tree
automata, allowing us to lift an automaton over a category to an automaton over
its operad of spliced arrows. We show that every CFG over a category can be
pulled back along a ND finite state automaton over the same category, and hence
that CF languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. The
last important ingredient is the identification of a left adjoint $C[-] :
Operad \to Cat$ to the operad of spliced arrows functor, building the ""contour
category"" of an operad. Using this, we generalize the C-S representation
theorem, proving that any context-free language of arrows over a category $C$
is the functorial image of the intersection of a $C$-chromatic tree contour
language and a regular language.

state is lighter than the top quark, then the rare decay of the latter, on
account of the high yield of the $t\bar t$ events, could provide a potential
hunting ground of those exotic states particularly during the high luminosity

aggregator model, where the aggregator is used to bundle demand flexibility
from flexible resources and deliver it to flexibility customers such as
Distributed/Transmission System Operator (DSO/TSO) in flexibility markets, has
been adopted. However, the aggregator role introduces various security and
trust challenges. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based flexibility
trading framework dubbed PlexiChain to address the security and trust
challenges the aggregator poses in the centralised aggregator model. The
security evaluations performed using a real-world dataset show that PlexiChain
is robust against known security attacks, such as MadIoT and False Data
Injection attacks. Additionally, the performance evaluations show that
PlexiChain has lower computation and communication costs than other
blockchain-based applications in resource-constrained environments.

variations and the large distribution gap between source and unseen target
data. To this end, we propose a unified framework, Style-HAllucinated Dual
consistEncy learning (SHADE), to handle such domain shift in various visual
tasks. Specifically, SHADE is constructed based on two consistency constraints,
Style Consistency (SC) and Retrospection Consistency (RC). SC enriches the
source situations and encourages the model to learn consistent representation
across style-diversified samples. RC leverages general visual knowledge to
prevent the model from overfitting to source data and thus largely keeps the
representation consistent between the source and general visual models.
Furthermore, we present a novel style hallucination module (SHM) to generate
style-diversified samples that are essential to consistency learning. SHM
selects basis styles from the source distribution, enabling the model to
dynamically generate diverse and realistic samples during training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our versatile SHADE can significantly enhance the
generalization in various visual recognition tasks, including image
classification, semantic segmentation and object detection, with different
models, i.e., ConvNets and Transformer.

the operation of future 6G applications such as the metaverse. Nonetheless,
current communication schemes are, at heart, a mere reconstruction process that

to a human-like conversation is semantic communications. In this paper, a novel
machine reasoning framework is proposed to pre-process and disentangle source
data so as to make it semantic-ready. In particular, a novel contrastive
learning framework is proposed, whereby instance and cluster discrimination are
performed on the data. These two tasks enable increasing the cohesiveness
between data points mapping to semantically similar content elements and
disentangling data points of semantically different content elements.
Subsequently, the semantic deep clusters formed are ranked according to their
level of confidence. Deep semantic clusters of highest confidence are
considered learnable, semantic-rich data, i.e., data that can be used to build
a language in a semantic communications system. The least confident ones are
considered, random, semantic-poor, and memorizable data that must be
transmitted classically. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of our
contrastive learning approach in terms of semantic impact and minimalism. In
fact, the length of the semantic representation achieved is minimized by 57.22%
compared to vanilla semantic communication systems, thus achieving minimalist
semantic representations.

translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation
modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as
gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract
high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features
generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between

we investigate the hypothesis that the ability of a large language model to
in-context learn-perform a task is not uniformly spread across all of its
underlying components. Using a 66 billion parameter language model (OPT-66B)
across a diverse set of 14 downstream tasks, we find this is indeed the case:
$\sim$70% of attention heads and $\sim$20% of feed forward networks can be
removed with minimal decline in task performance. We find substantial overlap
in the set of attention heads (un)important for in-context learning across
tasks and number of in-context examples. We also address our hypothesis through
a task-agnostic lens, finding that a small set of attention heads in OPT-66B
score highly on their ability to perform primitive induction operations
associated with in-context learning, namely, prefix matching and copying. These
induction heads overlap with task-specific important heads, suggesting that
induction heads are among the heads capable of more sophisticated behaviors
associated with in-context learning. Overall, our study provides several
insights that indicate large language models may be under-trained to perform
in-context learning and opens up questions on how to pre-train language models

Compared to traditional storage networks, DSNs are built on top of blockchains,
which can incentivize service providers and ensure strong security. However,
existing DSNs face two major challenges. First, deduplication can only be
achieved at the directory-level. Missing file-level deduplication leads to
unavoidable extra storage and bandwidth cost. Second, current DSNs realize file
indexing by storing extra metadata while blockchain ledgers are not fully
exploited. To overcome these problems, we propose FileDAG, a DSN built on
DAG-based blockchain to support file-level deduplication in storing
multi-versioned files. When updating files, we adopt an increment generation
method to calculate and store only the increments instead of the entire updated
files. Besides, we introduce a two-layer DAG-based blockchain ledger, by which
FileDAG can provide flexible and storage-saving file indexing by directly using
the blockchain database without incurring extra storage overhead. We implement
FileDAG and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments. The results
demonstrate that FileDAG outperforms the state-of-the-art industrial DSNs

suffers from numerical instability as the denominator gets close to zero. There
is a need to develop structure-preserving integrators without invoking the
quotient formula. In this work, the potential energy of a Hamiltonian system is
split into two parts, and specially developed quadrature rules are applied
separately to them. The resulting integrators can be regarded as classical ones
perturbed with first- or second-order terms, and the energy split guarantees
the dissipative nature in the numerical residual. In the meantime, the
conservation of invariants is respected in the design. A complete analysis of
the proposed integrators is given, with representative numerical examples
provided to demonstrate their performance. They can be used either
independently as energy-decaying and momentum-conserving schemes for nonlinear
problems or as an alternate option with a conserving integrator, such as the
LaBudde-Greenspan integrator, when the numerical instability in the difference

  Journal on Sep 25, 2022",,"10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120265",,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The detection of critical heat flux (CHF) is crucial in heat boiling
applications as failure to do so can cause rapid temperature ramp leading to
device failures. Many machine learning models exist to detect CHF, but their
performance reduces significantly when tested on data from different domains.
To deal with datasets from new domains a model needs to be trained from
scratch. Moreover, the dataset needs to be annotated by a domain expert. To
address this issue, we propose a new framework to support the generalizability
and adaptability of trained CHF detection models in an unsupervised manner.
This approach uses an unsupervised Image-to-Image (UI2I) translation model to
transform images in the target dataset to look like they were obtained from the
same domain the model previously trained on. Unlike other frameworks dealing
with domain shift, our framework does not require retraining or fine-tuning of
the trained classification model nor does it require synthesized datasets in
the training process of either the classification model or the UI2I model. The
framework was tested on three boiling datasets from different domains, and we
show that the CHF detection model trained on one dataset was able to generalize
to the other two previously unseen datasets with high accuracy. Overall, the
framework enables CHF detection models to adapt to data generated from
different domains without requiring additional annotation effort or retraining
of the model.

$\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where $X \in \mathcal{X}, Y \in \mathcal{Y}$ lie in
any general spaces, and we wish to test the null that $X$ is independent of
$Y$. Modern test statistics such as the kernel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence
Criterion (HSIC) and Distance Covariance (dCov) have intractable null
distributions due to the degeneracy of the underlying U-statistics. Thus, in
practice, one often resorts to using permutation testing, which provides a
nonasymptotic guarantee at the expense of recalculating the quadratic-time
statistics (say) a few hundred times. This paper provides a simple but
nontrivial modification of HSIC and dCov (called xHSIC and xdCov, pronounced
``cross'' HSIC/dCov) so that they have a limiting Gaussian distribution under
the null, and thus do not require permutations. This requires building on the
newly developed theory of cross U-statistics by Kim and Ramdas (2020), and in
particular developing several nontrivial extensions of the theory in Shekhar et
al. (2022), which developed an analogous permutation-free kernel two-sample
test. We show that our new tests, like the originals, are consistent against
fixed alternatives, and minimax rate optimal against smooth local alternatives.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that compared to the full dCov or HSIC, our
variants have the same power up to a $\sqrt 2$ factor, giving practitioners a
new option for large problems or data-analysis pipelines where computation, not
sample size, could be the bottleneck.

accommodating dark matter (DM). In this work, we consider that the dark sector
is connected to the standard model only via RHNs and ask how DM can be produced
from RHNs. Our framework concentrates on a rather simple and generic
interaction that couples RHNs to a pair of dark particles. Depending on whether
RHNs are light or heavy in comparison to the dark sector and also on whether
one or both of them are in the freeze-in/out regime, there are many distinct
scenarios resulting in rather different results. We conduct a comprehensive and
systematic study of all possible scenarios in this paper. For illustration, we
apply our generic results to the type-I seesaw model with the dark sector
extension, addressing whether and when DM in this model can be in the freeze-in
or freeze-out regime. Some observational consequences in this framework are
also discussed.

field games (MFGs) governed by the first-order master equation in a bounded
domain. We establish the unique identifiability result by showing that the
running cost function within any given proper (state) space-time subdomain is
uniquely determined by the MFG boundary data of this subdomain. There are
several salient features of our study. The MFG system couples two nonlinear
parabolic PDEs with one forward in time and the other one backward in time, and
moreover there is a probability measure constraint. These make the inverse
problem study new to the literature and highly challenging. We develop an
effective and efficient scheme in tackling the inverse problem including the
high-order variation in the probability space around a nontrivial distribution,
and the construction of a novel class of CGO solutions to serve as the
``probing modes"". Our study opens up a new field of research on inverse
problems for MFGs.

stationary measure, based on the compatibility of three types of local moves of
any down-right path. The stationary measure on a horizontal path turns out to
be a tilting of the stationary measure of the asymmetric simple exclusion
process (ASEP) with two open boundaries. Similar to open ASEP, the statistics
of this tilted stationary measure as the number of sites $N\rightarrow\infty$
(with the bulk and boundary parameters fixed) also exhibit a phase diagram,
which is a tilting of the phase diagram of open ASEP. We study the limit of
mean particle density as an example.

Typically, it computes the latent representations of the query and document
independently, thus failing to fully capture the interactions between the query
and document. To alleviate this, recent work expects to get query-informed
representations of documents. During training, it expands the document with a
real query, while replacing the real query with a generated pseudo query at
inference. This discrepancy between training and inference makes the dense
retrieval model pay more attention to the query information but ignore the
document when computing the document representation. As a result, it even
performs worse than the vanilla dense retrieval model, since its performance
depends heavily on the relevance between the generated queries and the real
query. In this paper, we propose a curriculum sampling strategy, which also
resorts to the pseudo query at training and gradually increases the relevance
of the generated query to the real query. In this way, the retrieval model can
learn to extend its attention from the document only to both the document and
query, hence getting high-quality query-informed document representations.
Experimental results on several passage retrieval datasets show that our
approach outperforms the previous dense retrieval methods1.

applications, e.g. for object removal. Recently, there has been a surge of
research on generating diverse completions for missing regions. However,
existing methods require large training sets from a specific domain of
interest, and often fail on general-content images. In this paper, we propose a
diverse completion method that does not require a training set and can thus
treat arbitrary images from any domain. Our internal diverse completion (IDC)
approach draws inspiration from recent single-image generative models that are
trained on multiple scales of a single image, adapting them to the extreme
setting in which only a small portion of the image is available for training.
We illustrate the strength of IDC on several datasets, using both user studies
and quantitative comparisons.

promising method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In this
study, we establish a deep learning computational framework, HL-nets, for
computing the flow field of hydrodynamic lubrication involving cavitation
effects. Two classical cavitation conditions, i.e., the Swift-Stieber (SS)
condition and the Jakobsson-Floberg-Olsson (JFO) condition, are implemented in
the PINNs to solve the Reynolds equation. For the non-negativity constraint of
the SS cavitation condition, a penalizing scheme with a residual of the
non-negativity and an imposing scheme with a continuous differentiable
non-negative function are proposed. For the complementarity constraint of the
JFO cavitation condition, the pressure and cavitation fraction are taken as the
neural network outputs, and the residual of the Fischer-Burmeister (FB)
equation constrains their complementary relationships. Multi-task learning
(MTL) methods are applied to balance the newly introduced loss terms described
above. To estimate the accuracy of HL-nets, we present a numerical solution of
the Reynolds equation for oil-lubricated bearings involving cavitation. The
results indicate that the proposed HL-nets can highly accurately simulate
hydrodynamic lubrication involving cavitation phenomena. The imposing scheme
can effectively improve the accuracy of the training results of PINNs, and it
is expected to have great potential to be applied to different fields where the
non-negativity constraint is needed.
