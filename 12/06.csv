  Partial Linear Models",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Generalized additive partial linear models (GAPLMs) are appealing for model
interpretation and prediction. However, for GAPLMs, the covariates and the
degree of smoothing in the nonparametric parts are often difficult to determine
in practice. To address this model selection uncertainty issue, we develop a
computationally feasible model averaging (MA) procedure. The model weights are
data-driven and selected based on multifold cross-validation (CV) (instead of
leave-one-out) for computational saving. When all the candidate models are
misspecified, we show that the proposed MA estimator for GAPLMs is
asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible
Kullback-Leibler loss. In the other scenario where the candidate model set
contains at least one correct model, the weights chosen by the multifold CV are
asymptotically concentrated on the correct models. As a by-product, we propose
a variable importance measure to quantify the importances of the predictors in
GAPLMs based on the MA weights. It is shown to be able to asymptotically
identify the variables in the true model. Moreover, when the number of
candidate models is very large, a model screening method is provided. Numerical
experiments show the superiority of the proposed MA method over some existing
model averaging and selection methods.

electronic states are often used to simulate nonadiabatic processes in the
condensed phase. A long-standing problem of these methods is their lack of
detailed balance, meaning that they do not conserve the equilibrium
distribution. In this article, we investigate ideas for how to restore detailed
balance in mixed quantum--classical systems by tailoring the previously
proposed spin-mapping approach to thermal equilibrium. We find that adapting
the spin magnitude can recover the correct long-time populations but is
insufficient to conserve the full equilibrium distribution. The latter can
however be achieved by a more flexible mapping of the spin onto an ellipsoid,
which is constructed to fulfill detailed balance for arbitrary potentials. This
ellipsoid approach solves the problem of negative populations that has plagued
previous mapping approaches and can therefore be applied also to strongly
asymmetric and anharmonic systems. Because it conserves the thermal
distribution, the method can also exploit efficient sampling schemes used in
standard molecular dynamics, which drastically reduces the number of
trajectories needed for convergence. The dynamics does however still have
mean-field character, as is observed most clearly by evaluating reaction rates
in the golden-rule limit. This implies that although the ellipsoid mapping
provides a rigorous framework, further work is required to find an accurate
classical-trajectory approximation that captures more properties of the true
quantum dynamics.

advancements in tools that facilitate the collection of social data, opening up
thus new opportunities for analyzing social networks. Social network analysis
studies the patterns of social relations and aims at discovering the hidden
features embedded in the structure of social networks. One of the most
important features in social networks is community structure : densely knit
groups of individuals. The dynamic nature of interaction in social networks
often challenges the detection of such community structures. The contributions
in this thesis fall into two categories.The first category highlights the
problem of identifying overlapping communities over time. To carry out such
analysis, a framework called OLCPM (Online Label propagation and Clique
Percolation Method) is proposed. It is an online algorithm based on clique
percolation and label propagation methods. OLCPM has two main features : the
first one is its ability to discover overlapping communities, while the second
is its effectiveness in handling fine-grained temporal net works. As for as the
second category is concerned, it emphasizes on the problem of analyzing
communities that are embedded at different temporal scales. For example, in
networks of interaction such as e-mails or phone calls, individuals are
involved in daily as well as occasional conversations. We propose a first
method for analyzing communities at multiple temporal scales. Hence, the
dynamic network (link streams) is studied at different temporal granularities,
and coherent communities (called stable communities) over a period of time are
detected at each temporal granularity. The two proposed approaches are
validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

been found to degrade in performance under distribution shift, a phenomenon
that occurs when data at test-time does not come from the same distribution as
the source training set. Equally as challenging is the task of obtaining labels
in real-time due to issues like long-labeling feedback loops. The lack of
adequate methods that address the aforementioned challenges constitutes the
need for approaches that continuously adapt the PLM to a distinct distribution.
Unsupervised domain adaptation adapts a source model to an unseen as well as
unlabeled target domain. While some techniques such as data augmentation can
adapt models in several scenarios, they have only been sparsely studied for
addressing the distribution shift problem. In this work, we present an approach
(MEMO-CL) that improves the performance of PLMs at test-time under distribution
shift. Our approach takes advantage of the latest unsupervised techniques in
data augmentation and adaptation to minimize the entropy of the PLM's output
distribution. MEMO-CL operates on a batch of augmented samples from a single
observation in the test set. The technique introduced is unsupervised,
domain-agnostic, easy to implement, and requires no additional data. Our
experiments result in a 3% improvement over current test-time adaptation
baselines.

in a 10 nm thick film of the 3D topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 coated with a
10 nm thick MgF2 layer using transient absorption spectroscopy in the UV-Vis
region. The ultraslow hole dynamics was observed by applying multiphoton
resonant pumping of massless Dirac fermions and bound valence electrons in
Bi2Se3 at a certain wavelength sufficient for their photoemission and
subsequent trapping at the Bi2Se3/MgF2 interface. The emerging deficit of
electrons in the film makes it impossible for the remaining holes to recombine,
thus causing their ultraslow dynamics measured at a specific probing
wavelength. We also found an extremely long rise time (~600 ps) for this
ultraslow optical response, which is due to the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
splitting at the valence band maximum and the resulting intervalley scattering
between the splitting components. The ultraslow hole dynamics in Bi2Se3 due to
the presence of the Bi2Se3/MgF2 interface is nevertheless much faster than the
known ultraslow electron dynamics at the Si/SiO2 interface, also induced by
multiphoton excitation in Si. The observed dynamics of long-lived holes is
gradually suppressed with decreasing Bi2Se3 film thickness for the 2D TI Bi2Se3
(film thickness 5, 4, and 2 nm) due to the loss of resonance conditions for
multiphoton photoemission caused by the gap opening at the Dirac surface state
nodes. This behavior indicates that the dynamics of massive Dirac fermions
predominantly determines the relaxation of photoexcited carriers for both the

for slowly-rotating superfluid neutron stars, valid up to second-order
perturbation theory, building on the original formulation reported by Andersson
and Comer in 2001. The present study constitutes an extension of previous work
in the single-fluid case where it was shown that the Hartle-Thorne formalism
needs to be amended since it does not provide the correct results when the
energy density does not vanish at the surface of the star. We discuss in detail
the corrections that need to be applied to the original two-fluid formalism in
order to account for non vanishing energy densities at the boundary. In the
process, we also find a correction needed in the computation of the deformation
of the stellar surface in the original two-fluid model in all cases
(irrespective of the value of the energy density at the surface). The
discrepancies found between the two formalisms are illustrated by building
numerical stellar models, focusing on the comparison in the calculation of the
stellar mass, the deformation of the star, and in the Kepler limit of rotation.
In particular, using a toy-model equation of state for which the energy density
does not vanish at the boundary of the star we demonstrate that the corrections
to the formalism we find impact the structure of slowly-rotating superfluid
neutron stars in a significant way.

theory perspective, a materials-specific description is challenging due to the
correlated nature of the materials and complications arising from the multiband

interacting models, and find that the correlations themselves can lead to local
magnetic order close to linear potential scattering defects at the surface of
the superconductor. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in a
real-space setup using a prototype electronic structure, we allow for arbitrary

calculation of the topological invariant and the topological gap allows us to
map out the phase diagram for the case of a linear chain of potential

the canonical view images may lose the discriminative detail clues from the

in poor performance. To handle this issue, we propose to fuse the original

of this design is that the cross-attention mechanism in the transformer could
be an ideal solution to align the discriminative texture clues from the

fertile playground for studies on geometry frustration, band topology and other
novel ordered states. A representative class of materials AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,
Rb, Cs) have been proved to possess various unconventional phases such as
superconductivity, non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ band topology, and electronic
nematicity, which are intertwined with multiple interlaced charge density waves
(CDW). However, the interplay among these novel states and their mechanisms are
still elusive. Recently, the discovery of isostructural titanium-based
single-crystals ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs), which demonstrate similar multiple
exotic states but in the absence of the concomitant intertwined CDW, has been
offering an ideal opportunity to disentangle these complex novel states in
kagome-lattice. Here, we combine the high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to systematically
investigate the low-lying electronic structure of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$. For the first
time, we experimentally demonstrate the coexistence of flat bands and multiple
non-trivial topological states, including type-II Dirac nodal lines and
non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological surface states therein. Furthermore, our
findings as well provide the hint of rotation symmetry breaking in
RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$, suggesting the directionality of the electronic structure and
possibility of emerging pure electronic nematicity in this new family of kagome
compounds, which may provide important insights into the electronic nematic
phase in correlated kagome metals.

is a critical step to improve models on a task like semantic segmentation.
However, prominent algorithms for pretraining neural networks use image-level

self-supervised contrastive learning. These objectives do not model spatial
information, which might be sub-optimal when finetuning on downstream tasks
with spatial reasoning. In this work, we pretrain network with a location-aware
(LOCA) self-supervised method which fosters the emergence of strong dense

dense pseudo-labels and a relative location prediction task to encourage
learning about object parts and their spatial arrangements. Our experiments
show that LOCA pretraining leads to representations that transfer competitively

MD4 consists of 48 steps and produces a 128-bit hash given a message of
arbitrary finite size. MD5 is a more secure 64-step extension of MD4. Both MD4
and MD5 are vulnerable to practical collision attacks, yet it is still not
realistic to invert them, i.e. to find a message given a hash. In 2007, the
39-step version of MD4 was inverted via reducing to SAT and applying a CDCL
solver along with the so-called Dobbertin's constraints. As for MD5, in 2012
its 28-step version was inverted via a CDCL solver for one specified hash
without adding any additional constraints. In this study, Cube-and-Conquer (a
combination of CDCL and lookahead) is applied to invert step-reduced versions
of MD4 and MD5. For this purpose, two algorithms are proposed. The first one
generates inversion problems for MD4 by gradually modifying the Dobbertin's
constraints. The second algorithm tries the cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer
with different cutoff thresholds to find the one with minimal runtime
estimation of the conquer phase. This algorithm operates in two modes: (i)
estimating the hardness of an arbitrary given formula; (ii) incomplete
SAT-solving of a given satisfiable formula. While the first algorithm is
focused on inverting step-reduced MD4, the second one is not area-specific and
so is applicable to a variety of classes of hard SAT instances. In this study,
for the first time in history, 40-, 41-, 42-, and 43-step MD4 are inverted via
the first algorithm and the estimating mode of the second algorithm. 28-step
MD5 is inverted for four hashes via the incomplete SAT-solving mode of the
second algorithm. For three hashes out of them this is done for the first time.

In this case, the flow field is characterized by vortical structures developing
along the streamwise direction known as Prandt's vortices of the second kind
(Prandtl 1965). As demonstrated in previous experimental and numerical works,
the strength and flow organization of these turbulent structures depend on the
ridge shape. In this paper, the effect of the ridge geometry on the generation
of secondary currents is investigated using the linearised RANS-based model

triangular and elliptical ridges are studied and the secondary flows are
compared in order to highlight the main differences and similarities. The
analogies of the flow organisation between the three geometries suggest that
the secondary currents do not depend on the ridge shape when the ridges are
small and isolated, and the strength of secondary flows collapses when properly
scaled with the mean ridge height. Finally, the generation of secondary flows
and the effect of the ridge shape on the flow organisation is studied in detail
for the complex geometries. In particular, for trapezoidal ridges, we observed
that tertiary flows emerge for the ridges where the scaling behaviour does not

and existing pandemics (e.g., COVID-19, HIV). Widespread testing supports
effective epidemic control by (1) reducing transmission via identifying cases,
and (2) tracking outbreak dynamics to inform targeted interventions. However,
infectious disease surveillance presents unique statistical challenges. For
instance, the true outcome of interest - one's positive infectious status, is
often a latent variable. In addition, presence of both network and temporal
dependence reduces the data to a single observation. As testing entire
populations regularly is neither efficient nor feasible, standard approaches to
testing recommend simple rule-based testing strategies (e.g., symptom based,
contact tracing), without taking into account individual risk. In this work, we
study an adaptive sequential design involving n individuals over a period of
{\tau} time-steps, which allows for unspecified dependence among individuals
and across time. Our causal target parameter is the mean latent outcome we
would have obtained after one time-step, if, starting at time t given the
observed past, we had carried out a stochastic intervention that maximizes the
outcome under a resource constraint. We propose an Online Super Learner for
adaptive sequential surveillance that learns the optimal choice of tests
strategies over time while adapting to the current state of the outbreak.
Relying on a series of working models, the proposed method learns across
samples, through time, or both: based on the underlying (unknown) structure in
the data. We present an identification result for the latent outcome in terms

extended tails within which star formation can happen, giving them the typical

galaxies provide an opportunity to understand ongoing star formation in the
stripped tails. We report the ultraviolet observations of the jellyfish
galaxies JW39, JO60, JO194 and compare with observations in optical continuum
and $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$. We detect knots of star formation in the disk and
tails of the galaxies and find that their UV and H$\alpha$ flux are well
correlated. The optical emission line ratio maps of these galaxies are used to
identify for every region the emission mechanism, due to either star formation,
LINER or a mix of the two phenomena. The star-forming regions in the emission
line maps match very well with the regions having significant UV flux. The
central regions of two galaxies (JW39, JO194) show a reduction in UV flux which
coincides with composite or LINER regions in the emission line maps. The
galaxies studied here demonstrate significant star formation in the stripped
tails, suppressed star formation in the central regions and present a possible

proofs could be automated using a verification framework for first-order logic.
We took the challenge and automated their formalization using Why3,
significantly reducing the proof effort. We systematically followed the Coq
proofs and realized that in many cases at around one third of the way Why3 was
able to discharge all VCs. Furthermore, the proofs still requiring interactions
(e.g. induction, witnesses for existential proofs, assertions) were factorized
isolating auxiliary results that we stated explicitly. In this way, we achieved
an almost-automatic soundness and safety proof of the memory model.
Nonetheless, our development allows an extraction of a correct-by-construction
concrete memory model, going thus further than the preliminary Why version of
Leroy and Blazy.

In this work, the Active Flux method is extended for the first time to a

  affine lines","Minor edits. Final version, 10 pages, to appear in the Journal of
  Algebraic Combinatorics",,,,"math.AC math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by recent results of Tao-Ziegler [Discrete Anal. 2016] and
Greenfeld-Tao (2022 preprint) on concatenating affine-linear functions along
subgroups of an abelian group, we show three results on recovering
affine-linearity of functions $f : V \to W$ from their restrictions to affine
lines, where $V,W$ are $\mathbb{F}$-vector spaces and $\dim V \geqslant 2$.
First, if $\dim V < |\mathbb{F}|$ and $f : V \to \mathbb{F}$ is affine-linear
when restricted to affine lines parallel to a basis and to certain ""generic""
lines through $0$, then $f$ is affine-linear on $V$. (This extends to all
modules $M$ over unital commutative rings $R$ with large enough
characteristic.) Second, we explain how a classical result attributed to von
Staudt (1850s) extends beyond bijections: if $f : V \to W$ preserves affine
lines $\ell$, and if $f(v) \not\in f(\ell)$ whenever $v \not\in \ell$, then
this also suffices to recover affine-linearity on $V$, but up to a field
automorphism. In particular, if $\mathbb{F}$ is a prime field
$\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ ($p>2$) or $\mathbb{Q}$, or a completion
$\mathbb{Q}_p$ or $\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is affine-linear on $V$.
  We then quantitatively refine our first result above, via a weak
multiplicative variant of the additive $B_h$-sets initially explored by Singer
[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1938], Erdos-Turan [J. London Math. Soc. 1941], and
Bose-Chowla [Comment. Math. Helv. 1962]. Weak multiplicative $B_h$-sets occur
inside all rings with large enough characteristic, and in all infinite or large
enough finite integral domains/fields. We show that if $R$ is among any of
these classes of rings, and $M = R^n$ for some $n \geqslant 3$, then one
requires affine-linearity on at least $\binom{n}{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$-many
generic lines to deduce the global affine-linearity of $f$ on $R^n$. Moreover,
this bound is sharp.

dimension five. We perform the calculations in momentum space and use the quark
propagator in the hot and dense medium. The numerical results at non-zero
temperature and baryon chemical potential demonstrate that the mass of the
particle rises considerably by increasing the baryon chemical potential at a
fixed temperature (for both the zero and non-zero temperatures) up to
approximately $\mu_{B}=0.4$ GeV. After this point, it starts to fall by
increasing the baryon chemical potential and it vanishes at
$\mu_{B}=(1.03-1.15)$ GeV for finite temperatures: The vanishing point moves to
lower baryon chemical potentials by increasing the temperature. At zero
temperature, the mass reaches to roughly a fixed value at higher baryon
chemical potentials. On the other hand, the decay constant decreases
considerably with respect to baryon chemical potential up to roughly
$\mu_{B}=0.4$ GeV, but after this point, it starts to increase in terms of the
baryon chemical potential at finite temperatures. At $T=0$, the decay constant
reaches to a fixed value at higher chemical potentials, as well. It is also
seen that the obtained results for the mass and decay constant at $T=\mu_{B}=0$

of $Z$ factory at a future $e^+e^-$ collider such as CEPC or FCC-$ee$ provides
a great opportunity to perform this task because of the large statistics and
high reconstruction efficiencies for $b$-hadrons at $Z$ pole. In this paper, we
present a systematic study on the LFU test in the future $Z$ factories. The
goal is three-fold. Firstly, we study the sensitivities of measuring the
LFU-violating observables of $b\to c \tau \nu$, $i.e.$, $R_{J/\psi}$,
$R_{D_s}$, $R_{D_s^\ast}$ and $R_{\Lambda_c}$, where $\tau$ decays muonically.
For this purpose, we develop the strategies for event reconstruction, based on
the track information significantly. Secondly, we explore the sensitivity
robustness against detector performance and its potential improvement with the
message of event shape or beyond the $b$-hadron decays. A picture is drawn on
the variation of analysis sensitivities with the detector tracking resolution
and soft photon detectability, and the impact of Fox-Wolfram moments is studied
on the measurement of relevant flavor events. Finally, we interpret the
projected sensitivities in the SM effective field theory, by combining the LFU
tests of $b\to c \tau \nu$ and the measurements of $b\to s \tau^+\tau^-$ and
$b\to s \bar{\nu} \nu$. We show that the limits on the LFU-violating energy

be combined. A state-of-the-art observational causal discovery algorithm for
time series capable of handling latent confounders and contemporaneous effects,
called LPCMCI, is extended to profit from casual constraints found through
randomized control trials. Numerical results show that, given perfect
interventional constraints, the reconstructed structural causal models (SCMs)
of the extended LPCMCI allow 84.6% of the time for the optimal prediction of
the target variable. The implementation of interventional and observational
causal discovery is modular, allowing causal constraints from other sources.
  The second part of this thesis investigates the question of regret minimizing
control by simultaneously learning a causal model and planning actions through
the causal model. The idea is that an agent to optimize a measured variable
first learns the system's mechanics through observational causal discovery. The
agent then intervenes on the most promising variable with randomized values
allowing for the exploitation and generation of new interventional data. The
agent then uses the interventional data to enhance the causal model further,
allowing improved actions the next time.
  The extended LPCMCI can be favorable compared to the original LPCMCI
algorithm. The numerical results show that detecting and using interventional
constraints leads to reconstructed SCMs that allow 60.9% of the time for the
optimal prediction of the target variable in contrast to the baseline of 53.6%
when using the original LPCMCI algorithm. Furthermore, the induced average
regret decreases from 1.2 when using the original LPCMCI algorithm to 1.0 when
using the extended LPCMCI algorithm with interventional discovery.

The MFTR model emerges as a natural generalization of both the fluctuating
two-ray (FTR) and the $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading models through a more
general yet equally mathematically tractable model. This generalization enables
the presence of additional multipath clusters in the purely ray-based FTR
model, and the convenience of the new underlying fading channel model is
discussed in depth. Then, we derive all the chief probability functions of the
MFTR model (e.g., probability density function (PDF), cumulative density
function (CDF), and moment generation function) in closed-form, having {a
mathematical complexity similar to} other fading models in the
state-of-the-art. We also provide two additional analytical formulations for
the PDF and the CDF: (i) in terms of a continuous mixture of $\kappa$-$\mu$
shadowed distributions, and (ii) as an infinite discrete mixture of Gamma
distributions. Such expressions enable to conduct performance analysis under
MFTR fading by directly leveraging readily available results for the
$\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed or Nakagami-$m$ cases, respectively. The performance of
wireless communications systems undergoing MFTR fading is exemplified in terms
of a classical benchmarking metric like the outage probability, both in exact
and asymptotic forms, and the amount of fading.

robustness challenges to the conventional statistical learning framework: mild
shifts in the test covariate distribution can significantly affect the
performance of the statistical model learned based on the training
distribution. The model performance typically deteriorates when extrapolation
happens: namely, covariates shift to a region where the training distribution
is scarce, and naturally, the learned model has little information. For
robustness and regularization considerations, adversarial perturbation
techniques are proposed as a remedy; however, careful study needs to be carried
out about what extrapolation region adversarial covariate shift will focus on,
given a learned model. This paper precisely characterizes the extrapolation
region, examining both regression and classification in an infinite-dimensional
setting. We study the implications of adversarial covariate shifts to
subsequent learning of the equilibrium -- the Bayes optimal model -- in a
sequential game framework. We exploit the dynamics of the adversarial learning
game and reveal the curious effects of the covariate shift to equilibrium
learning and experimental design. In particular, we establish two directional
convergence results that exhibit distinctive phenomena: (1) a blessing in
regression, the adversarial covariate shifts in an exponential rate to an
optimal experimental design for rapid subsequent learning, (2) a curse in
classification, the adversarial covariate shifts in a subquadratic rate fast to
the hardest experimental design trapping subsequent learning.

medium/high-entropy alloys. It has been found the DHU states of these materials
often possess a significantly lower energy than other disorder models, and can
lead to unique electronic and thermal transport properties, which resulted from
mechanisms distinct from those identified for their crystalline counterparts.

elevation and crustal thickness between the two hemispheres of Mars known as
the ""Martian Dichotomy"". Initially, this scenario referred to an impact in the
northern hemisphere that would lead to a huge impact basin (dubbed the
""Borealis Basin""), while more recent work has instead suggested a hybrid origin
that produces the Dichotomy through impact-induced crust-production. The
majority of these studies have relied upon impact scaling-laws inaccurate at
such large-scales, however, and those that have included realistic impact
models have utilised over-simplified geophysical models and neglected any
material strength. Here we use a large suite of strength-including
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) impact simulations coupled with a more
sophisticated geophysical scheme of crust production and primordial crust to
simultaneously investigate the feasibility of a giant impact on either
hemisphere of Mars to have produced its dichotomous crust distribution, and
utilise spherical harmonic analysis to identify the best-fitting cases. We find
that the canonical Borealis-forming impact is not possible without both
excessive crust production and strong antipodal effects not seen on Mars'
southern hemisphere today. Our results instead favour an impact and subsequent
localised magma ocean in the southern hemisphere that results in a thicker
crust than the north upon crystallisation. Specifically, our best-fitting cases
suggest that the projectile responsible for the Dichotomy-forming event was of
radius 500-750 km, and collided with Mars at an impact angle of 15-30{\deg}
with a velocity of 1.2-1.4 times mutual escape speed ($\sim$6-7 km/s).

However, linear programming algorithms and approximate OT solvers via Sinkhorn

larger input size, resulting in a poor approximation quality of the permutation

paper proposes an unsupervised projection-based CLWE model called quantized
Wasserstein Procrustes (qWP). qWP relies on a quantization step of both the

require dense input signals such as video or multi-view images, or leverage a

fail to achieve realistic reconstruction when only a single image is available.
To enable the data-efficient creation of realistic animatable 3D humans, we
propose ELICIT, a novel method for learning human-specific neural radiance
fields from a single image. Inspired by the fact that humans can effortlessly
estimate the body geometry and imagine full-body clothing from a single image,
we leverage two priors in ELICIT: 3D geometry prior and visual semantic prior.
Specifically, ELICIT utilizes the 3D body shape geometry prior from a skinned
vertex-based template model (i.e., SMPL) and implements the visual clothing
semantic prior with the CLIP-based pre-trained models. Both priors are used to
jointly guide the optimization for creating plausible content in the invisible
areas. Taking advantage of the CLIP models, ELICIT can use text descriptions to
generate text-conditioned unseen regions. In order to further improve visual
details, we propose a segmentation-based sampling strategy that locally refines
different parts of the avatar. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple popular

questions about the fairness properties of such systems start to take center
stage. Most existing work on algorithmic fairness assume complete observation
of features at prediction time, as is the case for popular notions like
statistical parity and equal opportunity. However, this is not sufficient for
models that can make predictions with partial observation as we could miss
patterns of bias and incorrectly certify a model to be fair. To address this, a
recently introduced notion of fairness asks whether the model exhibits any
discrimination pattern, in which an individual characterized by (partial)
feature observations, receives vastly different decisions merely by disclosing
one or more sensitive attributes such as gender and race. By explicitly
accounting for partial observations, this provides a much more fine-grained
notion of fairness.
  In this paper, we propose an algorithm to search for discrimination patterns
in a general class of probabilistic models, namely probabilistic circuits.
Previously, such algorithms were limited to naive Bayes classifiers which make
strong independence assumptions; by contrast, probabilistic circuits provide a
unifying framework for a wide range of tractable probabilistic models and can
even be compiled from certain classes of Bayesian networks and probabilistic
programs, making our method much more broadly applicable. Furthermore, for an
unfair model, it may be useful to quickly find discrimination patterns and
distill them for better interpretability. As such, we also propose a
sampling-based approach to more efficiently mine discrimination patterns, and
introduce new classes of patterns such as minimal, maximal, and Pareto optimal
patterns that can effectively summarize exponentially many discrimination
patterns

discrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework

charged macromolecules in multivalent salt solutions. This curious effect takes
place, e.g., when a charged polymer, such as DNA, adsorbs excess counterions so
that the counterion-dressed surface charge reverses its sign, leading to the
inversion of the polymer drift driven by an external electric field. In order
to characterize this seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon that cannot be
captured by electrostatic mean-field theories, we adapt here a previously
developed strong-coupling-dressed Poisson-Boltzmann approach to the cylindrical
geometry of the polyelectrolyte-salt system. Within the framework of this
formalism, we derive an analytical polymer mobility formula dressed by charge
correlations. In qualitative agreement with polymer transport experiments, this
mobility formula predicts that the increment of the monovalent salt, the
decrease of the multivalent counterion valency, and the increase of the
dielectric permittivity of the background solvent, suppress charge correlations
and increase the multivalent bulk counterion concentration required for EP
mobility reversal. These results are corroborated by coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations showing how multivalent counterions induce mobility
inversion at dilute concentrations and suppress the inversion effect at large
concentrations. This re-entrant behavior, previously observed in the
aggregation of like-charged polymer solutions, calls for verification by
polymer transport experiments.

possibility for an interacting dark sector that could constitute some or all of
dark matter. We perform a comprehensive study of precision cosmological
observables on minimal atomic dark matter, exploring for the first time the
full parameter space of dark QED coupling and dark electron and proton masses
$(\alpha_{D}, m_{e_{D}}, m_{p_{D}})$ as well as the two cosmological parameters
of aDM mass fraction $f_D$ and temperature ratio $\xi$ at time of SM
recombination. We find that significant aDM mass fractions require the dark
electron mass to obey an $\alpha_{D}$-dependent lower bound. We also show how
aDM can accommodate the $(H_0, S_8)$ tension from late-time measurements,
leading to a significantly better fit than $\Lambda$CDM or $\Lambda$CDM + dark
radiation. Furthermore, including late-time measurements leads to strikingly
tight constraints on the parameters of atomic dark matter. The dark QED
coupling must obey an upper bound of $\alpha_{D} < 0.025$, the dark electron
cannot be lighter than the SM electron, and $\Delta N_D, f_{D} \gtrsim 0.1$ are
preferred. The dark proton mass is seemingly unconstrained. Our results serve
as an important new jumping-off point for future precision studies of atomic
dark matter at non-linear and smaller scales.

an unresolved challenge despite its importance for understanding a variety of
environmental, biological, and industrial phenomena. Well over a century of
concerted effort has aimed toward a quantitative, mechanistic explanation of
Osborne Reynolds' seminal observation of transition to turbulence in pipe flow,
typically occurring when the ratio of inertial and viscous fluid dynamic forces
-- the eponymous Reynolds number -- is approximately 2000. These studies have
been confounded by subsequent observations that the Reynolds number at which
transition occurs can be delayed to values as high as 100,000. This record-high
laminar Reynolds number has not been exceeded in any similar flow configuration
for more than 70 years, however, as it required experiments to be conducted
using pipe lengths of up to 18 meters housed within a bomb shelter to eliminate
ambient disturbances to the flow. Here, we demonstrate a benchtop jet flow that
exhibits persistent laminar flow beyond a Reynolds number of 116,000, a value
limited only by the maximum flow-generating capacity of the current facility.
High-speed videography of the jet shape and flow velocimetry within the jet
confirm the laminar nature of the flow, even in the presence of visible ambient
flow disturbances arising from non-idealities in the facility design. The
measured spatial evolution of the velocity profile within the jet, approaching
a ""top hat"" shape with increasing downstream distance, appears to promote
persistence of the laminar flow. These results suggest the existence of an
empirically accessible flow regime in which turbulence might be circumvented at
arbitrarily high Reynolds numbers.

evaluators in typed lambda calculi if the strategy (the evaluation order of
redexes) is realisable. We present a proof that one-step equivalence holds when
(1) the `readback' stage satisfies straightforward well-formedness provisos,
(2) the `eval' stage implements a `uniform' strategy, and (3) the eval-apply
evaluator implements a `balanced hybrid' strategy that has `eval' as a
subsidiary strategy. The proof proceeds by application of the `lightweight
fusion by fixed-point promotion' program transformation on evaluator
implementations to fuse readback and eval into the balanced hybrid. The proof
can be followed with no previous knowledge of the transformation. We use
Haskell as the implementation language, with all evaluators written in monadic
style to guarantee semantics (strategy) preservation, but the choice of
implementation language is immaterial.
  To determine the extent of the equivalence, we provide a comprehensive survey

strategies' properties and uses. We improve the formal definition of uniform

the generic higher-order evaluators used in the proof that deliver all plain
evaluators as fixed-points by instantiation. We introduce a systematic notation

equivalences, including (non-)equivalences within a style and
(non-)equivalences between styles not proven by the transformation.

Technique"" (GRT). We study the formation channels of the ICL and BCG as a
function of distance from the cluster center and the dynamical state of the
clusters at $z=0$. To do this, we trace back the stars of the ICL and BCG, and
identify the stellar components in which they existed when they first fell into
the clusters. We find that the progenitors of the ICL and BCG in the central
region of the cluster fell earlier and with a higher total mass ratio of the
progenitors to the cluster compared to the outer region. This causes a negative
radial gradient in the infall time and total mass ratio of the progenitors.
Although stellar mass of the progenitors does not show the same radial gradient
in all clusters, massive galaxies ($M_{\rm{gal}} > 10^{10}~M_{\odot}~h^{-1}$)
are the dominant formation channel of the ICL and BCG for all clusters, except
for our most relaxed cluster. For clusters that are dynamically more unrelaxed,
we find that the progenitors of the ICL and BCG fall into their clusters more
recently, and with a higher mass and mass ratio. Furthermore, we find that the
diffuse material of massive galaxies and group-mass halos that is formed by
pre-processing contributes significantly to the ICL in the outer region of the
unrelaxed clusters.

question within the modern landscape of galaxy evolution studies. These
processes are indelibly imprinted on the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF). We
present constraints on the shape and evolution of the SMF, the quiescent galaxy
fraction, and the cosmic stellar mass density across 90% of the history of the
Universe from $z=7.5\rightarrow0.2$ via the COSMOS survey. Now with deeper and
more homogeneous near-infrared coverage exploited by the COSMOS2020 catalog, we
leverage the large 1.27 deg$^{2}$ effective area to improve sample statistics
and understand cosmic variance particularly for rare, massive galaxies and push
to higher redshifts with greater confidence and mass completeness than previous
studies. We divide the total stellar mass function into star-forming and
quiescent sub-samples through $NUVrJ$ color-color selection. Measurements are
then fitted with Schechter functions to infer the intrinsic SMF, the evolution
of its key parameters, and the cosmic stellar mass density out to $z=7.5$. We
find a smooth, monotonic evolution in the galaxy SMF since $z=7.5$, in
agreement with previous studies. The number density of star-forming systems
seems to have undergone remarkably consistent growth spanning four decades in
stellar mass from $z=7.5\rightarrow2$ whereupon high-mass systems become
predominantly quiescent (i.e. downsizing). An excess of massive systems at
$z\sim2.5-5.5$ with strikingly red colors, some newly identified, increase the
observed number densities to the point where the SMF cannot be reconciled with
a Schechter function. Systematics including cosmic variance and/or AGN
contamination are unlikely to fully explain this excess, and so we speculate
that there may be contributions from dust-obscured objects similar to those
found in FIR surveys. (abridged)

employ long-slit spectroscopy to map the spatially-resolved outflow and
rotational velocities of the ionized gas. We also perform surface brightness
decompositions of host galaxy images to constrain the enclosed stellar mass
distributions as functions of distance from the supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). Assuming that the NLR gas is accelerated by AGN radiation pressure,
and subsequently decelerated by the host galaxy and SMBH gravitational
potentials, we derive outflow velocity profiles where the gas is launched in
situ at multiple distances from the SMBH. We find a strong correlation between
the turnover (from acceleration to deceleration) radii from our models, with
the turnovers seen in the observed velocities and spatially-resolved mass
outflow rates for the AGN with bolometric luminosities $>$ 10$^{44}$ erg
sec$^{-1}$. This consistency indicates that radiation pressure is the dominant
driving mechanism behind the NLR outflows in these moderate-luminosity AGN,
with a force multiplier $\sim$500 yielding the best agreement between the
modeled and observed turnover radii. However, in Meena2021 we found that this
trend may not hold at lower luminosities, where our modeled turnover distance
for NGC 4051 is much smaller than in the observed kinematics. This result may
indicate that either additional force(s) are responsible for accelerating the

with a unique laboratory for studying the currently uncertain physics of binary
evolution and compact object formation as well as for studying the wind
collision region in an massive eclipsing binary system. We use deep Chandra
observations of WR 20a to study the time variability of the wind collision
region between the two Wolf-Rayet stars and are able to produce an X-ray light
curve covering $\approx$2/3 of its orbital period. We find that the X-ray light
curve is asymmetric because the flux of one peak is 2.5$\sigma$ larger than the
flux of the other peak. This asymmetry could be caused by asymmetric mass-loss
from the two stars or by the lopsidedness of the wind collision region due to
the unusually fast rotation of the system. The X-ray light curve is also
shifted in phase space when compared to the optical light curves measured by
TESS and ASAS-SN. Additionally, we explore the ultimate fate of this system by
modeling the resultant binary black hole merger expected at the end of the two

the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in

as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More
recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating
for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the
non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An
inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase
transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the
field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at
finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide
insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin
excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the
field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev
interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a
spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the
field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin
structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics
simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized

factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where
zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine

supported systems such as protoplanetary disks, accretion disks around black
holes, or galactic disks, as it can both feed turbulence or lead to
gravitational fragmentation. While such systems can be studied in the shearing
box approximation with high local resolution, the large density contrasts that
are possible in the case of fragmentation still limit the utility of Eulerian
codes with constant spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a novel
self-gravity solver for the shearing box based on the TreePM method of the
moving-mesh code AREPO. The spatial gravitational resolution is adaptive which
is important to make full use of the quasi-Lagrangian hydrodynamical resolution
of the code. We apply our new implementation to two- and three-dimensional,
self-gravitating disks combined with a simple $\beta$-cooling prescription. For
weak cooling we find a steady, gravoturbulent state, while for strong cooling
the formation of fragments is inevitable. To reach convergence for the critical
cooling efficiency above which fragmentation occurs, we require a smoothing of
the gravitational force in the two dimensional case that mimics the
stratification of the three-dimensional simulations. The critical cooling
efficiency we find, $\beta \approx 3$, as well as box-averaged quantities
characterizing the gravoturbulent state, agree well with various previous
results in the literature. Interestingly, we observe stochastic fragmentation
for $\beta > 3$, which slightly decreases the cooling efficiency required to
observe fragmentation over the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk. The numerical
method outlined here appears well suited to study the problem of galactic disks

galaxies, have been extensively used in the past to identify peculiar
kinematics such as dual active galactic nuclei, outflows or mergers. From a
large DP galaxy sample, a connection to minor merger galaxies with ongoing star
formation was suggested. To gain a better understanding of different mechanisms
creating a DP signature, we here explore synthetic SDSS spectroscopic
observations computed from disc models and simulations. We show how a DP
signature is connected to the central part of the rotation curve of galaxies,
which is mostly shaped by the stellar bulge. We, furthermore, find that bars
can create strong DP emission-line signatures when viewed along their major
axis. Major mergers can form a central rotating disc in late post-coalescence
merger stages (1\,Gyr after the final coalescence), which creates a DP
signature. Minor mergers tend to show a DP feature with no correlation to the
galaxy inclination within 350\,Myr after the final coalescence. Comparisons of
these scenarii with observations disfavour major mergers, since these show
predominantly elliptical and only a few S0 morphologies. Furthermore, at such a
late merger stage the enhanced star formation is most likely faded. Bars and
minor mergers, on the other hand, can be compared quite well with the
observations. Both observations coincide with increased star formation found in
observations, and minor mergers in particular do not show any dependency with
the observation direction. However, observations resolving the galaxy
kinematics spatially are needed to distinguish between the discussed
possibilities. More insight into the origin of DP will be gained by a broader
comparison with cosmological simulations. The understanding of the DP origin
can provide important tools to study the mass growth of galaxies in future high
redshift surveys.

one recovers the standard static boson star solutions, that can be excited if
$n\neq 0$. On the other hand, for the case where all particles have fixed
radial and total angular momentum numbers $n$ and $\ell$, with $\ell\neq 0$,
but are homogeneously distributed with respect to their magnetic number $m$,
one obtains the $\ell$-boson stars, whereas when $\ell=m=0$ and $n$ takes

generalizations of these configurations are presented, including the
multi-$\ell$ multi-state boson stars, that constitute the most general
solutions to the $N$-particle, static, spherically symmetric, semiclassical

definite. In spite of the fact that the same spacetime configurations also
appear in multi-field classical theories, in semiclassical gravity they arise
naturally as the quantum fluctuations associated with the state of a single

adversarial attacks: adding tiny carefully-crafted perturbations on legitimate
input samples can cause misclassifications. To address this issue, we propose a
general scheme to protect quantum learning systems from adversarial attacks by
randomly encoding the legitimate data samples through unitary or quantum error
correction encoders. In particular, we rigorously prove that both global and
local random unitary encoders lead to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e.
barren plateaus) for any variational quantum circuits that aim to add
adversarial perturbations, independent of the input data and the inner
structures of adversarial circuits and quantum classifiers. In addition, we
prove a rigorous bound on the vulnerability of quantum classifiers under local
unitary adversarial attacks. We show that random black-box quantum error
correction encoders can protect quantum classifiers against local adversarial
noises and their robustness increases as we concatenate error correction codes.
To quantify the robustness enhancement, we adapt quantum differential privacy
as a measure of the prediction stability for quantum classifiers. Our results
establish versatile defense strategies for quantum classifiers against
adversarial perturbations, which provide valuable guidance to enhance the
reliability and security for both near-term and future quantum learning

depends on the nature of the collider and the center-of-mass energy of

believed to be essential to accretion onto black holes. These instabilities
saturate in a turbulent state; therefore, the spatial and temporal variability
in the horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) will be able to
empirically assess this critical aspect of accretion theory. However,
interstellar scattering blurs high-frequency radio images from the Galactic
center and introduces spurious small-scale structures, complicating the
interpretation of spatial fluctuations in the image. We explore the impact of
interstellar scattering on the polarized images of Sgr A* and demonstrate that
for credible physical parameters, the intervening scattering is
non-birefringent. Therefore, we construct a scattering mitigation scheme that
exploits horizon-resolving polarized millimeter/submillimeter VLBI observations
to generate statistical measures of the intrinsic spatial fluctuations and
therefore the underlying accretion flow turbulence. An optimal polarization
basis is identified, corresponding to measurements of the fluctuations in
magnetic field orientation in three dimensions. We validate our mitigation
scheme using simulated data sets and find that current and future ground-based

fundamental problem in nonconvex optimization, with noisy zeroth- or

gradient estimation takes $O(\log d/\epsilon^{1.75})$ quantum queries to find
an $\epsilon$-SOSP. We then prove that perturbed gradient descent is robust to

$O(\epsilon/\sqrt{d})$ noise on the zeroth- and first-order oracles,

we propose a simple analytical model for the free energy landscape based on a
priori concept of Boltzmann thermal mixing among multiple parabolic potentials
representing different energetically degenerated ground states in contrast to
the popular Landau theory using the high-temperature disordered state as a
reference. The model recovers both the Weiss molecular field theory and the
temperature dependent behaviors of the second order Landau coefficient. It is
rather remarkable that such a simple analytical expression can describe a wide
variety of properties across the ferroelectric phase transition in PbTiO3,
including the temperature dependences of the spontaneous polarization, the heat
capacities, the permittivity tensor, and the lattice parameters. The approach
also allows parametrization of the free energy function across phase

magnetic braking, and thermal relaxation oscillations to small values until it
crosses a critical threshold $q_\text{min}$. When that happens, the binary
undergoes the tidal Darwin instability, leading to a rapid coalescence of the
components and observable brightening of the system. So far, the distribution
of $q$ has not been measured on a sufficiently large population of contact
binary stars, because the determination of $q$ for a single contact binary
usually requires spectroscopy. But as was shown previously, it is possible to
infer the mass-ratio distribution of the entire population of contact binaries
from the observed distribution of their light curve amplitudes. Employing
Bayesian inference, we obtain a sample of contact binary candidates from the
Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog combined with data from Gaia and estimates of
effective temperatures. We assign to each candidate a probability of being a
contact binary of either late or early type. Overall, our sample includes about
300 late-type and 200 early-type contact binary candidates. We model the
amplitude distribution assuming that mass ratios are described by a power law
with an exponent $b$ and a cut off at $q_\text{min}$. We find
$q_\text{min}=0.087^{+0.024}_{-0.015}$ for late-type contact binaries with
periods longer than 0.3 days. For late-type binaries with shorter periods, we
find $q_\text{min}=0.246^{+0.029}_{-0.046}$, but the sample is small. For early
type contact binary stars with periods shorter than 1 day, we obtain
$q_\text{min}=0.030^{+0.018}_{-0.022}$. These results indicate a dependence of
$q_\text{min}$ on the structure of the components and are broadly compatible
with previous theoretical predictions. Our method can be easily extended to
large samples of contact binaries from TESS and other space-based surveys.

extraction algorithms identify relationships by comparing the prototypes

query sentences using a trained metric function. However, as these domains
always have considerable differences from those in the training dataset, the
generalization ability of these approaches on unseen relations in many domains

relations to extract new relations in various domains more effectively. By
exploring the relationships between relations using prior information, we
effectively improve the prototype representation of relations. By using
contrastive learning to make the classification margins between sentence

enhanced. Additionally, utilizing a transfer learning approach for the
cross-domain problem allows the generation process of the prototype to account
for the gap between other domains, making the prototype more robust and
enabling the better extraction of associations across multiple domains. The

point formation in the linear operation regime, where unidirectional perfect
transmission due to loss compensation is achieved from the presented
non-Hermitian parity-time symmetric nanoscale system. The demonstrated
plasmonic metasurface breaks the Lorentz reciprocity law at the nanoscale when
its nonlinear response is considered, mainly due to its spatially asymmetric
geometry combined with enhanced nonlinearity. Strong and broadband
nonreciprocity with unity transmission contrast from opposite directions is
realized under relatively low input laser intensity values. Furthermore,
asymmetric nonlinear third harmonic generation with a pronounced contrast is
also illustrated by the same nonreciprocal metasurface design. The findings of
this work can lead to the realization of various new self-induced nonreciprocal

gravities is used to construct a class of anisotropic evolution scenarios. In
unimodular GR the determinant of the metric is constrained to be a fixed number
or a function. However, the metric of a generic anisotropic universe is not
compatible with the unimodular constraint, so that a redefinition of the
metric, to properly take into account the constraint, need be performed. The
unimodular constraint is imposed on $F(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame by means
of a Lagrangian multiplier, to get the equations of motion. The resulting
equations can be viewed as a reconstruction method, which allows to determine
what function of the Ricci scalar can realize the desired evolution. For the
sake of clarity, some characteristic examples are invoked to show how this
reconstruction method works explicitly. The de Sitter spacetime here
considered, in the context of unimodular $F(R)$ gravity, is suitable to
describe both the early- and late-time epochs of the universe history.

we consider the most pessimistic scenario: the (unlikely) case in which LISA

higher multipoles (beyond the dominant $\ell = |m| = 2$ mode) in the

models have shown satisfactory performance. However, one major drawback for
them is that they fall short in their long-term predictive ability. Although
graph convolutional networks (GCN) also perform well, their edge
representations do not contain complete information and it can lead to biases.
Another drawback is that they usually use input features which they are unable
to predict. Hence, those models are unable to predict further future. We
propose a model that can propagate predictions further into the future and it
has better edge representations. In particular, we model the pandemic as a
spatial-temporal graph whose edges represent the transition of infections and
are learned by our model. We use a two-stream framework that contains GCN and
recursive structures (GRU) with an attention mechanism. Our model enables
mobility analysis that provides an effective toolbox for public health
researchers and policy makers to predict how different lock-down strategies
that actively control mobility can influence the spread of pandemics.
Experiments show that our model outperforms others in its long-term predictive
power. Moreover, we simulate the effects of certain policies and predict their
impacts on infection control.

neighboring regions. The results stemming from this model are in excellent
agreement with the observational results reported in the above-cited paper,
where the exponents have been obtained for the two-dimensional earth-to-sky RGB

that the cloud fields that we obtain from our model are fractal, with the outer

  is 9 pages with 4 figures. Appendix is 12 pages with 11 figures and 1 table",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Sampling-based methods have become a cornerstone of contemporary approaches
to Model Predictive Control (MPC), as they make no restrictions on the
differentiability of the dynamics or cost function and are straightforward to
parallelize. However, their efficacy is highly dependent on the quality of the
sampling distribution itself, which is often assumed to be simple, like a
Gaussian. This restriction can result in samples which are far from optimal,
leading to poor performance. Recent work has explored improving the performance
of MPC by sampling in a learned latent space of controls. However, these
methods ultimately perform all MPC parameter updates and warm-starting between
time steps in the control space. This requires us to rely on a number of
heuristics for generating samples and updating the distribution and may lead to
sub-optimal performance. Instead, we propose to carry out all operations in the
latent space, allowing us to take full advantage of the learned distribution.
Specifically, we frame the learning problem as bi-level optimization and show
how to train the controller with backpropagation-through-time. By using a
normalizing flow parameterization of the distribution, we can leverage its
tractable density to avoid requiring differentiability of the dynamics and cost
function. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach on simulated robotics
tasks and demonstrate its ability to surpass the performance of prior methods
and scale better with a reduced number of samples.

the density of the inner fluid exceeds that of the outer one, and this

compute not only strongly nonlinear primary finger states up to the point of

  membrane of fuel cells using magnetic resonance imaging",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The efficiency of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell depends on the
mobility of protons in the PEM, which is determined by the hydration and
temperature of the membrane. While optical techniques or neutron or x-ray
scattering techniques may be used to study the inhomogeneities in hydration and
temperature in PEMs, these techniques cannot provide 3 dimensional spatial
resolution in measuring layered PEMs. Due to their ability to provide
non-invasive 3D images, spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and spin-spin
relaxation time (T2) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of protons in
PEMs have been suggested as methods to map hydration in the fuel cells. We show
that while T1 and T2 imaging may be used to map hydration in PEMs under
isothermal conditions, proton T1 and T2 are also a function of temperature. For
PEM fuel cells, where current densities are large and thermal gradients are
expected, T1 and T2 relaxation times cannot be used for mapping hydration. The
chemical shift of the mobile proton is, however, a strong function of hydration
but not temperature. Therefore, chemical shift imaging (CSI) can be used to map
hydration. The diffusion constant of the mobile proton, which can be determined
by pulsed field gradient NMR, increases with both temperature and hydration.
Therefore, CSI followed by imaging of diffusion via pulsed field gradients can
be used for separate mappings of hydration and temperature in PEMs. Here, we
demonstrate a 16 x 16 pixel MRI mapping of hydration and temperature in Nafion
PEMs with a spatial resolution of 1 mm x 1 mm, a total scan time of 3 minutes,
a temperature resolution of 6 K, and an uncertainty in hydration within 15%.
The demonstrated mapping can be generalized for imaging exchange membranes of

find that material toward Polaris and Ursa Major is distributed along a plane
similarly oriented to the Radcliffe wave. The Spider projected in between
appears disconnected in 3D, a discontinuity in the loop shape. We find that the
elongated cavity that forms the inner part of the NCPL is a protrusion of the
Local Bubble (LB) likely filled with warm (possibly hot) gas that passes
through and goes beyond the location of the dense clouds. An idealized model of
the cavity as a prolate spheroid oriented toward the observer, reminiscent of
the cylindrical model proposed by Meyerdierks et al. (1991), encompasses the
protrusion and fits into arcs of warm H I gas expanding laterally to it. As
first argued by Meyerdierks et al. (1991), the non-spherical geometry of the
cavity and the lack of OB stars interior to it disfavor an origin caused by a
single point-like source of energy or multiple supernovae. Rather, the
formation of the protrusion could be related to the propagation of warm gas
from the LB into a pre-existing non-uniform medium in the lower halo, the
topology of which was likely shaped by past star formation activity along the
Local Arm.

stark contrast to simple perturbative arguments predicting the interaction to

strong coupling to a cavity mode leads to a drastic enhancement of the
polariton interactions as compared to bare excitons. This enhancement is caused
by the small polariton mass due to its photonic component, which increases the
kinetic cost associated with minimising the dipole-dipole repulsion.
Microscopic numerical calculations for one-dimensional geometries show that the
interaction strength for the lower polariton branch is maximal when the exciton
and the cavity mode are close to resonance, and can easily exceed
state-of-the-art cavity decay rates for realistic confinement lengths, thus
entering the polariton blockade regime. Analytical extension of our results to
two-dimensional polariton systems highlight dipolar polaritons as a most

negative energy, we explore constraints on the amount of negative energy that
can be carried by a free Dirac field in a slab-shaped region between two
parallel spatial planes. Specifically, we ask what is the minimum possible
uniform energy density that can exist at some time, considering all possible
states and all possibilities for the physics outside the slab. The vacuum state
where we identify the two sides of the slab with antiperiodic boundary
conditions gives one possible state with uniform negative energy, but we argue
that states with more negative energy exist above 1+1 dimensions. Technically,
we reduce the problem to studying a massive Dirac field on an interval in 1+1
dimensions and numerically search for states with uniform energy density in a
lattice regulated model. We succeed in finding states with enhanced negative
energy (relative to the antiperiodic vacuum) which also appear to have a
sensible continuum limit. Our results for the mass-dependence of the minimum
uniform energy density in 1+1 dimensions suggest that for a 3+1 dimensional
massless Dirac fermion, it is possible to have states with arbitrarily large
uniform negative energy density in an arbitrarily wide slab.

We examined this de-identification method with respect to preserving utility

preserves the quality and utility of the faces much better than the other

preserve the privacy of the faces much better than other methods.

also allows programmers to extend the library with new RDT algorithms as they
are published, instead of waiting for the library to implement them. Our
library includes a collection of built-in op-based CRDT implementations,
including several that were not previously implemented. To demonstrate the
library, we built numerous apps on top of it, including decentralized

millions of customers from fraud, such as unauthorized use of credit cards. One
such mechanism is order fraud evaluation, where systems evaluate orders for

risk. Order fraud evaluation systems typically use binary classification models
that distinguish fraudulent and legitimate orders, to assess risk and take
action. We seek to devise a system that considers both financial losses of
fraud and long-term customer satisfaction, which may be impaired when incorrect
actions are applied to legitimate customers. We propose that taking actions to
optimize long-term impact can be formulated as a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
problem. Standard RL methods require online interaction with an environment to
learn, but this is not desirable in high-stakes applications like order fraud
evaluation. Offline RL algorithms learn from logged data collected from the
environment, without the need for online interaction, making them suitable for
our use case. We show that offline RL methods outperform traditional binary
classification solutions in SimStore, a simplified e-commerce simulation that
incorporates order fraud risk. We also propose a novel approach to training
offline RL policies that adds a new loss term during training, to better align
policy exploration with taking correct actions.

solving or approximately solving classical optimization problems. The algorithm
uses a schedule to interpolate between a driver Hamiltonian with an
easy-to-prepare ground state and a problem Hamiltonian whose ground state
encodes solutions to an optimization problem. The standard implementation
relies on the evolution being adiabatic: keeping the system in the
instantaneous ground state with high probability and requiring a time scale
inversely related to the minimum energy gap between the instantaneous ground
and excited states. However, adiabatic evolution can lead to evolution times
that scale exponentially with the system size, even for computationally simple
problems. Here, we study whether non-adiabatic evolutions with optimized
annealing schedules can bypass this exponential slowdown for one such class of
problems called the frustrated ring model. For sufficiently optimized annealing
schedules and system sizes of up to 39 qubits, we provide numerical evidence
that we can avoid the exponential slowdown. Our work highlights the potential

exhibits necking at a single location, corresponding to a long wavelength
bifurcation mode. If confined to a substrate or embedded in a matrix, the same
filament can exhibit periodic necking thus creating segments of finite length.
While periodic instabilities have been extensively studied in ductile metal
filaments and thin sheets, less is known about necking in hyperelastic
materials. There is a renewed interest in the role of necking in novel
materials to advance fabrication processes and to explain fragmentation
phenomena observed in 3D printed active biological matter. In both cases
materials are not well described by existing frameworks that employ J2
plasticity, and existing studies ignore the role of misfit stretches that may
emerge in these systems through chemical or biological contraction. To address
these limitations, we first experimentally demonstrate the role of the matrix
on the necking and fragmentation of a compliant embedded filament. Using a
strain softening generalized hyperelastic model, our analytical bifurcation
analysis explains the experimental observations and agrees with numerical
predictions. The analysis reveals 3 distinct bifurcation modes: a long
wavelength necking, recovering the Considere criterion; a periodic necking
observed in our experiments; and a short wavelength mode characterized by
localization along the center cord of the filament and independent of the
film-to-matrix stiffness ratio. We find that the softening coefficient and the
filament misfit stretch can significantly influence the stability threshold and
observed wavelength, respectively. Our results can guide the design and
fabrication of composite materials and explain the fragmentation processes

complex consists of two colliding clouds, called W33-blue and W33-red. We
decompose the velocity structures in W33-blue by fitting multiple velocity
components, and find a continuous and monotonic velocity field. Virial
parameters of Dendrogram structures suggest the dominance of gravity in
W33-blue. The strong positive correlation between velocity dispersion and
column density indicates the non-thermal motions in W33-blue may originate from
gravitationally driven collapse. These signatures suggest that the filamentary
structures in W33-blue result from the gravitational collapse of the compressed
layer. However, the large scale velocity gradient in W33-blue may mainly
originate from the cloud-cloud collision and feedback of active star formation,
instead of the filament-rooted longitudinal inflow. From the above observed
results, we argue that the cloud-cloud collision triggers formation of

are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of
sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in
practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is
directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we
present $\textit{Stars}$: a highly scalable method for building extremely
sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are
connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners
with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck

Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time,

halos, we find that the compact proto-massive galaxies undergo nearly
continuous mergers with smaller subhalos, boosting star formation rates (SFRs)
and the build up of stellar mass. The galaxies are already appreciably
chemically evolved by z=10, with modeled dust masses comparable to those
inferred from observations in the same epoch. We track gas accretion onto the
galaxies to understand how extreme SFRs can be sustained by these early
systems. We find that smooth gas accretion can maintain SFRs above 250
M$_{\odot}$ / yr but to achieve SFRs that boost galaxies well above the main
sequence, a larger perturbation like a gas-rich major merger is necessary to
trigger a starburst episode. Post-processing the Cosmic Sands simulations with
dust radiative transfer, we find that while the infrared luminosities of the
most dust rich galaxies are comparable to local ULIRGs, they are substantially
dimmer than classical z=2 sub-millimeter galaxies. We end with a discussion on
the possible reasons for this discrepancy at the highest masses and the future

for quantum mechanics can be derived from the two classical elastically
colliding particles with masses M and m satisfying a collision momentum
preserving equation. The properties of the classical elastic momentum collision
expression determine the full Edward Nelson energy collision energy for both
particles. This classical total energy expression does not require a
statistical expectation since no process was defined for the energy and it
models the main and incident particle velocities perfectly. Quantum mechanics
can be obtained by modelling the incident particle as a non-random potential
using stochastic processes modelling the forward, post-collision and backward
pre-collision velocities of the main particle. This presents the Schroedinger
equation exactly the way that Nelson proposed in 1966 except for the diffusion
constant. In this case the average energy is conserved in time and the forward,
post-collision and backward pre-collision velocities of the system are related
using statistical methods. If the incident particle does not have a potential
the additional constraints for the movement of the incident particle leads to
another Schroedinger equation. Finally, under suitable conditions it will be
shown that the colliding particles satisfy Minkowski metric in special
relativity. This last example shows how gravity can be quantized using details

and analyzing specific methods, such as the gradient descent ascent method

as a gradient-related ascent and descent algorithmic framework for solving
minimax problems. It allows update directions within acute angles to the
partial gradients. GRAND covers gradient-type, Newton-type, scaled gradient,
and other general descent ascent methods as special cases. We also propose its
alternating version, Alt-GRAND, in which $x$ and $y$ are updated sequentially.
For distributed computing problems, GRAND enables flexible methods' designs to
better exploit agents' heterogeneous computation capabilities in a system. In
particular, we propose hybrid methods allowing agents to choose gradient-type
or Newton-type updates based on their computation capabilities for both
distributed consensus and network flow problems. For both GRAND and Alt-GRAND,
we present global sublinear and linear rates in strongly-convex-nonconcave and
strongly-convex-PL settings, respectively. These results match the
state-of-the-art theoretical rates of GDA in corresponding settings and ensure
the linear convergence of distributed hybrid methods. We further discuss the
local superlinear performance of related Newton-based methods. Finally, we
conduct numerical experiments on centralized minimax and distributed computing
problems to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods. To the best of our
knowledge, GRAND is the first generalized framework for minimax problems with
provable convergence and rate guarantees. Moreover, our hybrid methods are the

cold deep liquid oceans and deep interior ice-X phases to states with hot
supercritical fluid interiors. There is a corresponding marked inflation of
radius for a given mass, similar to the runaway greenhouse radius inflation
effect noted earlier for terrestrial planets, but in the present case the

the best models underperform in images with weak spurious presence. However,
the effect of spurious cues varies far more dramatically across classes,
emphasizing the crucial, often overlooked, class-dependence of the spurious

perform better when they are absent. We then close the spurious gap by training
new classification heads on lowly ranked (i.e. without common spurious cues)

and privacy sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and biometric
authentication, it is critical to understand the fault-tolerance nature of
DNNs. Prior work primarily focuses on metrics such as Failures In Time (FIT)
rate and the Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate, which quantify how often a
device fails. Instead, this paper focuses on quantifying the DNN accuracy given
that a transient error has occurred, which tells us how well a network behaves
when a transient error occurs. We call this metric Resiliency Accuracy (RA). We
show that existing RA formulation is fundamentally inaccurate, because it
incorrectly assumes that software variables (model weights/activations) have
equal faulty probability under hardware transient faults. We present an
algorithm that captures the faulty probabilities of DNN variables under
transient faults and, thus, provides correct RA estimations validated by
hardware. To accelerate RA estimation, we reformulate RA calculation as a Monte
Carlo integration problem, and solve it using importance sampling driven by DNN
specific heuristics. Using our lightweight RA estimation method, we show that
transient faults lead to far greater accuracy degradation than what todays DNN
resiliency tools estimate. We show how our RA estimation tool can help design
more resilient DNNs by integrating it with a Network Architecture Search
framework.

co-planar sBHs in nearby, initially circular orbits around the supermassive

gravitationally bound near-Keplerian binaries in AGN discs, and we delineate
the discrete ranges of impact parameters and AGN disc parameters for which such
captures occur. We also report trends in the bound binaries' eccentricity and
sense of rotation (prograde or retrograde with respect to the background AGN
disc) as a function of the impact parameter of the initial encounter. While
based on an approximate description of gaseous friction, our results suggest
that binary formation in AGN discs should be common and may produce both
prograde and retrograde, as well as both circular and eccentric binaries.

scales in time, from the instantaneous to multi-year developments, and in
space, from one neighborhood to continents. Yet, there is little systematic
work on connecting the multiple scales, formal treatment of causality between
events, and measures of uncertainty for how events are related to one another.
We develop a method for extracting related chains of events that addresses
these limitations with armed conflict. Our method explicitly accounts for an
adjustable spatial and temporal scale of interaction for clustering individual
events from a detailed data set, the Armed Conflict Event & Location Data
Project. With it, we discover a mesoscale ranging from a week to a few months
and from tens to a few hundred kilometers, where long-range correlations and
nontrivial dynamics relating conflict events emerge. Importantly, clusters in
the mesoscale, while extracted only from conflict statistics, are identifiable
with causal mechanism cited in field studies. We leverage our technique to
identify zones of causal interaction around conflict hotspots that naturally
incorporate uncertainties. Thus, we show how a systematic, data-driven
procedure extracts social objects for study, providing a scope for scrutinizing
and predicting conflict amongst other processes.

find that the interaction between a surface Dirac plasmon polariton in the 3D
TI and a magnon polariton in the 2D AFM is mediated by the phonon coupling in
the 3D TI material. The coupling of phonons with an electromagnetic wave
propagating in the 3D TI enhances the permittivity of the TI thin film in a way
that results in a strong correlation between the dispersion of Dirac plasmon
polaritons on the surfaces of the TI with the thickness of the TI. As a result,
the dispersion of surface Dirac plasmon polaritons in the TI can be tuned
toward resonance with the magnon polariton in the AFM material by varying the
TI's thickness, thereby enhancing the strength of the coupling between the
excitations in the two materials. The strength of this coupling, which results
in the surface Dirac plasmon-phonon-magnon polariton, can be parameterized by
the amplitude of the avoided-crossing splitting between the two polariton

Specifically, we show that 1) pre-training on a massive corpus of unlabeled URL

computational speedup over traditional techniques has also been reported. In
this work, we develop an algorithmic framework, called Perm-QIO, to tailor QIO
tools to directly solve an arbitrary optimization problem, where the domain of
the underlying cost function is defined over a permutation group. Such problems
are not naturally recastable to a binary optimization and, therefore, are not
necessarily within the scope of direct implementation of traditional QIO tools.
We demonstrate the efficacy of Perm-QIO in leveraging the structure of
cost-landscape to find high-quality solutions for a class of vehicle routing
problems that belong to the category of non-trivial combinatorial optimization
over the space of permutations.

LaMB has a simple vision-based API that makes it more easily transferable to

evaluate LaMB, we construct a set of tasks that illustrate the complex

the limitations of traditional imaging techniques. A relevant case is
represented by correlation plenoptic imaging (CPI), a quantum imaging protocol

conventional light-field imaging, namely, the poor spatial resolution and the
reduced change of perspective for 3D imaging. However, the application
potential of high-resolution quantum imaging is limited, in practice, by the
need to collect a large number of frames to retrieve correlations. This creates
a gap, unacceptable for many relevant tasks, between the time performance of
quantum imaging and that of traditional imaging methods. In this article, we
address this issue by exploiting the photon number correlations intrinsic in
chaotic light, in combination with a cutting-edge ultrafast sensor made of a
large array of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). A novel single-lens CPI

for medical image understanding tasks. However, DNNs are notoriously fragile to
the class imbalance in image classification. We further point out that such
imbalance fragility can be amplified when it comes to more sophisticated tasks
such as pathology localization, as imbalances in such problems can have highly
complex and often implicit forms of presence. For example, different pathology
can have different sizes or colors (w.r.t.the background), different underlying
demographic distributions, and in general different difficulty levels to
recognize, even in a meticulously curated balanced distribution of training

identify \textit{hard-to-learn} (HTL) training samples, and improve pathology
localization by attending them explicitly, during training in

inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep classification models
have difficult-to-memorize samples and those may be effectively exposed through

beyond classification for the first time. We also present an interesting
demographic analysis which illustrates HTLs ability to capture complex

Kramers due to his seminal paper of 1940, where an archetypal example -
one-dimensional potential system subject to linear damping and weak white noise
- was considered and the quasi-stationary rate of escape over a potential
barrier was estimated for the ranges of extremely small and moderate-to-large
damping. The gap between these ranges was covered in the 80th by one of
Rashba's favourite disciples Vladimir Ivanovich Mel'nikov.
  It is natural to pose a question: how does the escape rate achieve the
quasi-stationary stage? At least in case of a single potential barrier, the
answer seems to be obvious: the escape rate should smoothly and monotonously
grow from zero at the initial instant to the quasi-stationary value at
time-scales of the order of the time required for the formation of the
quasi-stationary distribution within the potential well. Such answer appeared
to be confirmed with the analytic work of Vitaly Shneidman in 1997. However our
works in the end of the 90th and in the beginning of the 2000th in
collaboration with one more Rashba's favorite disciple Valentin Ivanovich Sheka
and with Riccardo Mannella showed that, at a shorter time-scale, namely that of
the order of the period of natural oscillations in the potential well, the
escape rate growth generically occured stepwise or even in an oscillatory
manner. Analytic results were confirmed with computer simulations.
  In the present paper, we review those results and provide a roadmap for the
development of the subject, in particular demonstrating that various recently
exploited experimental systems are excellent candidates for the observation of

We use the comoving volume densities of the AGN samples to quantify the effects
that tidal interactions have on the triggering of nuclear accretion. Our
hypothesis is that the pair sample contains AGN that are triggered by not only
stochastic accretion but also tidally induced accretion and correlated
accretion. With the level of stochastically triggered AGN fixed by the control
sample, we model the strength of tidally induced accretion and correlated
accretion as a function of projected separation (rp) and compare the model
expectations with the observed volume densities of dual AGN and offset AGN
(single AGN in a pair). At rp ~ 10 kpc, we find that tidal interactions induce
~30% more AGN than stochastic fueling and cause ~12% of the offset AGN to
become dual AGN because of correlations. The strength of both these effects
decreases with increasing rp. We also find that the OIII luminosities of the
AGN in galaxy pairs are consistent with those found in isolated galaxies,
likely because stochastically fed AGN dominate even among close pairs. Our
results illustrates that while we can detect tidally induced effects
statistically, it is challenging to separate tidally induced AGN and
stochastically triggered AGN in interacting galaxies.

The new scheme possesses several important properties: it locally preserves the
divergence-free constraint, it does not rely on any (approximate) Riemann
problem solver, and it robustly produces high-resolution and non-oscillatory
results. The derivation of the scheme is based on the Godunov-Powell
nonconservative modifications of the studied MHD systems. The local
divergence-free property is enforced by augmenting the modified systems with
the evolution equations for the corresponding derivatives of the magnetic field
components. These derivatives are then used to design a special piecewise
linear reconstruction of the magnetic field, which guarantees a non-oscillatory

accounts for the jump of the nonconservative product terms across cell
interfaces, thereby ensuring stability. We test the proposed PCCU scheme on
several benchmarks for both ideal and shallow water MHD systems. The obtained
numerical results illustrate the performance of the new scheme, its robustness,

based on the transformer architecture. Such models can be computationally
expensive and are typically statically set to meet the deployment scenario.
However, in real-time applications, the resources available for every inference
can vary considerably and be smaller than what state-of-the-art models require.
We can use dynamic models to adapt the model execution to meet real-time
application resource constraints. While prior dynamic work primarily minimized
resource utilization for less complex input images, we adapt vision
transformers to meet system dynamic resource constraints, independent of the
input image. We find that unlike early transformer models, recent
state-of-the-art vision transformers heavily rely on convolution layers. We
show that pretrained models are fairly resilient to skipping computation in the
convolution and self-attention layers, enabling us to create a low-overhead
system for dynamic real-time inference without extra training. Finally, we
explore compute organization and memory sizes to find settings to efficiency
execute dynamic vision transformers. We find that wider vector sizes produce a
better energy-accuracy tradeoff across dynamic configurations despite limiting
the granularity of dynamic execution, but scaling accelerator resources for
larger models does not significantly improve the latency-area-energy-tradeoffs.

Interest) based multimodal trajectory prediction model for probabilistic risk
assessment at intersections. In this study, we find that the visual AOI implies
the driving intention and is about 0.6-2.1 s ahead of the operation. Therefore,
we designed a trajectory prediction model that integrates the driving intention
(DI) and the multimodal trajectory (MT) predictions. The DI model was
pre-trained independently to extract the driving intention using features
including the visual AOI, historical vehicle states, and environmental context.
The intention prediction experiments verify that the visual AOI-based DI model
predicts steering intention 0.925 s ahead of the actual steering operation. The
trained DI model is then integrated into the trajectory prediction model to
filter multimodal trajectories. The trajectory prediction experiments show that
the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Risk assessment for
traffics at intersections verifies that the proposed method achieves high
accuracy and a low false alarm rate, and identifies the potential risk about 3
s before a conflict occurs.

customarily attributed to the relevance of cutoff axial wavenumbers and the
consequent absence of trapped modes (called ``evanescent eigenmodes'' here).
However, some recent eigenvalue problem studies yield that cutoff wavenumbers
may disappear for those equilibria where the external density varies
sufficiently slowly, thereby casting doubt on the rarity of candidate sausage
perturbations. We examine the responses of straight, transversely structured,
coronal slabs to small-amplitude sausage-type perturbations that excite axial
fundamentals by solving the pertinent initial value problem with eigensolutions
for a closed domain. The density variation in the slab exterior is dictated by
some steepness parameter $\mu$, and cutoff wavenumbers are theoretically
expected to be present (absent) when $\mu \ge 2$ ($\mu < 2$). However, our
numerical results show no qualitative difference in the system evolution when
$\mu$ varies, despite the differences in the modal behavior. Only oscillatory
eigenmodes are permitted when $\mu \ge 2$. Our discrete eigenspectrum becomes
increasingly closely spaced when the domain broadens, and an oscillatory
continuum results for a truly open system. Oscillatory eigenmodes remain
allowed and dominate the system evolution when $\mu <2$. We show that the
irrelevance of cutoff wavenumbers does not mean that all fast waves are
evanescent. Rather, it means that an increasing number of evanescent eigenmodes
emerge when the domain size increases. We conclude that sausage perturbations
remain difficult to detect even for the waveguide formulated here.

LUNA represents each number as a whole to model input. With number
pre-training, including regression loss and model distillation, LUNA bridges
the gap between number and vocabulary embeddings. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that explicitly injects numeracy capability into
language models using Number Plugins. Besides evaluating toy models on toy
tasks, we evaluate LUNA on three large-scale transformer models (RoBERTa, BERT,
TabBERT) over three different downstream tasks (TATQA, TabFact, CrediTrans),

LUNA. The augmented models also improve the official baseline of TAT-QA (EM:

builds consensus on the high-priority object under local observations and

has attracted much interest over the past few decades due to its wide
applications in various areas. Plenty of related optimization packages have
been developed based on Riemannian optimization approaches, which rely on some
basic geometrical materials of Riemannian manifolds, including retractions,
vector transports, etc. These geometrical materials can be challenging to
determine in general. Existing packages only accommodate a few well-known
manifolds whose geometrical materials are easily accessible. For other
manifolds which are not contained in these packages, the users have to develop
the geometric materials by themselves. In addition, it is not always tractable
to adopt advanced features from various state-of-the-art unconstrained
optimization solvers to Riemannian optimization approaches.
  We introduce CDOpt (available at https://cdopt.github.io/), a user-friendly
Python package for a class Riemannian optimization. Based on constraint
dissolving approaches, Riemannian optimization problems are transformed into
their equivalent unconstrained counterparts in CDOpt. Therefore, solving
Riemannian optimization problems through CDOpt directly benefits from various
existing solvers and the rich expertise gained over decades for unconstrained
optimization. Moreover, all the computations in CDOpt related to any manifold
in question are conducted on its constraints expression, hence users can easily
define new manifolds in CDOpt without any background on differential geometry.
Furthermore, CDOpt extends the neural layers from PyTorch and Flax, thus allows
users to train manifold constrained neural networks directly by the solvers for
unconstrained optimization. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that
CDOpt is highly efficient and robust in solving various classes of Riemannian
optimization problems.

critical to study the potential data leakage of models trained on sensitive

determine if a sample was part of the training set or not. The question is
whether these attacks can be reliably used in practice. We show that MI models
frequently misclassify neighboring nonmember samples of a member sample as
members. In other words, they have a high false positive rate on the
subpopulations of the exact member samples that they can identify. We then
showcase a practical application of MI attacks where this issue has a
real-world repercussion. Here, MI attacks are used by an external auditor
(investigator) to show to a judge/jury that an auditee unlawfully used
sensitive data. Due to the high false positive rate of MI attacks on member's
subpopulations, auditee challenges the credibility of the auditor by revealing
the performance of the MI attacks on these subpopulations. We argue that
current membership inference attacks can identify memorized subpopulations, but
they cannot reliably identify which exact sample in the subpopulation was used

seriously degraded by large communication delays if the delays are not properly

framework to compensate for such delays, thereby improving the performance of
the teleoperation system. The novelty of this PTGC framework is that
teleoperators intended trajectory is predicted at the vehicle side with their
delayed historical control commands and the LiDAR 3D point cloud of the
environment, and then the vehicle is guided by the predicted trajectory. By
removing the teleoperator from the direct control loop, the presented method is
less sensitive to delays, and delays are compensated as long as the prediction
horizon exceeds the delays. Human-in-the-loop simulation experiments are
designed to evaluate the teleoperation performance with the proposed method
under five delay levels. Based on the repeated measurement analysis of
variance, it is concluded that the PTGC method can significantly improve the
performance of the teleoperated ground vehicles under large delays(>200ms),
such as the task completion time (TCT), deviation to centerline (D2C) and
steering effort (SE). In addition, the results also show that teleoperators can
adapt to smaller delays, and the presented method is ineffective in such cases.

dimensions. Cross validation approaches are similarly computation-intensive. To
this end, our contribution is a novel non-iterative method to fit a Bridge
regression model. The main contribution lies in an explicit formula for Stein's
unbiased risk estimate for the out of sample prediction risk of Bridge
regression, which can then be optimized to select the desired tuning
parameters, allowing us to completely bypass MCMC as well as
computation-intensive cross validation approaches. Our procedure yields results
in about 1/8th to 1/10th of the computational time compared to iterative
schemes, without any appreciable loss in statistical performance. An R

functional theory, we explore the structural evolution of nanoribbons of
varying widths constructed by cutting the 2D sheet of ferroelectric
$\alpha$-III$_2$IV$_3$ (III=Al, Ga, In; VI=S, Se, Te). We discover a
one-dimensional ferroelectric nanothread (1DFENT) of ultrasmall diameter with
both axial and radial polarization, potentially enabling ultra-dense data
storage with a 1D domain of just three unit cells being the functional unit.
The polarization in 1DFENT of Ga$_2$Se$_3$ exhibits an unusual piezoelectric
response: a stretching stress along the axial direction will increase both
axial and radial polarization, referred to as auxetic piezoelectric effect.
Utilizing the intrinsically flat electronic bands, we demonstrate the
coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in 1DFENT and a
counterintuitive charge-doping-induced metal-to-insulator transition. The
1DFENT with both axial and radial polarization offers a counterexample to the
Mermin--Wagner theorem in 1D and suggests a new platform for the design of
ultrahigh-density memory and the exploration of exotic states of matter.

it is desirable to minimize the direct interaction of the DRL agent with the

state-of-the-art DRL-based policies are mostly trained using a physics-based

based on repeated evaluation of zero-order information. This technique was
successfully applied to techniques such as Model Predictive Control and Moving
Horizon Estimation, but it can exhibit slow convergence. Moreover, keeping all
iterates feasible in FSLP entails a large number of additional constraint
evaluations. In this paper, Anderson Acceleration (AA($d$)) is applied to the
zero-order update strategy improving the convergence rate and therefore
decreasing the number of constraint evaluations in the inner iterative
procedure of the FSLP algorithm. AA($d$) achieves an improved contraction rate
in the inner iterations, with proven local linear convergence. In addition, it
is observed that due to the improved zero-order update strategy, AA($d$)-FSLP
takes larger steps to find an optimal solution, yielding faster overall
convergence. The performance of AA($d$)-FSLP is examined for a time-optimal
point-to-point motion problem of a parallel SCARA robot. The reduction of the

loss among them is significantly reduced and the real time control of the IRS
reflection by the BS becomes easier to implement. However, the resultant near
field channel model also becomes drastically different. Thus, we propose an
element wise channel model for IRS to characterize the channel vector between
each single antenna user and the antenna array of the BS, which includes the
direct (without any IRS reflection) as well as the single and double
IRS-reflection channel components. Then, we formulate a problem to optimize the
reflection coefficients of all IRS reflecting elements for maximizing the
uplink sum rate of the users. By considering two typical cases with/without
perfect CSI at the BS, the formulated problem is solved efficiently by adopting
the successive refinement method and iterative random phase algorithm (IRPA),

integrated IRS BS architecture over the conventional multi antenna BS without
integrated IRS. Moreover, the proposed algorithms significantly outperform
other benchmark schemes in terms of sum rate, and the IRPA without CSI can
approach the performance upper bound with perfect CSI as the training overhead

cohomology theory for a crossed homomorphism on 3-Lie algebras and classify
infinitesimal deformations of crossed homomorphisms using the second cohomology
group. Finally, using the higher derived brackets, we construct an
$L_\infty$-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are crossed homomorphisms.
Consequently, we obtain the twisted $L_\infty$-algebra that controls
deformations of a given crossed homomorphism on 3-Lie algebras.

two-dimensional topolectrical (TE) model as a result of broken chiral and
reflection symmetries. The TE system consists of two segments hosting distinct
topological states with opposite signs of the valley Hall index, and separated
by a heterojunction. In the practical circuit, the valley Hall index can be
flipped between the two segments by modulating the onsite potential on the
sublattice nodes of the respective segments. The presence of resistive
coupling, which introduces non-Hermiticity in the system, subsequently leads to
the emergence of gapped and gapless valley and kink states in the admittance
spectra. These topological modes can be detected electrically by the impedance
readouts of the system which can be correlated to its admittance spectra.
Finally, we confirm the robustness of the valley Hall and kink states via
realistic LTspice simulation taking into account the tolerance windows and
parasitic effects inherent in circuit components. Our study demonstrates the
applicability of TE circuit networks as a platform to realize and tune
valley-dependent and kink topological phenomena.

line, which is an effective probe of the BLR materials. We detected significant
variations of the narrow Fe-K$\alpha$ line on a timescale of tens of days
during the type-2 (faint) phase in 2013-2014, and conducted ""narrow
Fe-K$\alpha$ reverberation mapping,"" comparing its flux variation with those of
the X-ray continuum from a corona and $B$-band continuum from an accretion
disk. We derived, as a result, a time lag of $10.1^{+5.8}_{-5.6}$ days

consistent with the location of the BLR determined in optical spectroscopic

the BLR materials remained at the same location without emitting optical
broad-lines during the type-2 phase. Considering the drastic decrease of the
radiation during the type-transition, our result is possibly inconsistent with
the hotly-discussed formation models of the BLR which propose that the
radiative pressure from an accretion disk should be the main driving force.

VDN and QMIX, are susceptible to a critical multi-agent pathology known as
relative overgeneralization (RO), which arises when the optimal joint action's
utility falls below that of a sub-optimal joint action in cooperative tasks. RO
can cause the agents to get stuck into local optima or fail to solve
cooperative tasks that require significant coordination between agents within a
given timestep. Recent value-based MARL algorithms such as QPLEX and WQMIX can
overcome RO to some extent. However, our experimental results show that they
can still fail to solve cooperative tasks that exhibit strong RO. In this work,
we propose a novel approach called curriculum learning for relative

target task to generate source tasks that are tailored to the current ability
of the learning agent and train the agent on these source tasks first. Then, to
effectively transfer the knowledge acquired in one task to the next, we use a
transfer learning method that combines value function transfer with buffer

demonstrate that, when applied to QMIX, CURO overcomes severe RO problem and
significantly improves performance, yielding state-of-the-art results in a

that the number of qubits of current quantum computers is still very limited,
and it cannot meet the minimum requirements for the number of qubits required

improved the Hamiltonian Cycle Detection (HCD) oracle based on mathematical
theorems. It can automatically eliminate infeasible solutions during the

nodes to aggregate the global information from all image tokens, but encourage
different group tokens to adaptively focus on the message broadcasting to

and planetesimal formation. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the
candidate hydrodynamic mechanisms that can generate turbulence in the outer
disk regions. The VSI requires rapid gas cooling in addition to vertical shear.
A linear stability analysis suggests that the VSI may not operate around the
midplane where gas cooling is inefficient. In this study, we investigate the
nonlinear outcome of the VSI in disks with a linearly VSI-stable midplane
region. We perform two-dimensional global hydrodynamical simulations of an
axisymmetric disk with vertically varying cooling times. The vertical cooling
time profile determines the thicknesses of the linearly VSI-stable midplane
layer and unstable layers above and below the midplane. We find that the
thickness of the midplane stable layer determines the vertical structure of
VSI-driven turbulence in the nonlinear saturated state. We identify two types
of final saturated state: (1) T states characterized by vertical turbulent
motion penetrating into the VSI-stable midplane layer and (2) pT states
characterized by turbulent motion confined in the unstable layers. The pT
states are realized when the midplane VSI-stable layer is thicker than two gas
scale heights. We also find that the VSI-driven turbulence is largely
suppressed at all heights when the VSI-unstable region lying above and below
the midplane is thinner than two gas scale heights. We present empirical
formulas that predict the strength of VSI-driven turbulence as a function of
the thicknesses of the unstable and stable layers. These formulas will be
useful for studying how VSI-driven turbulence and dust grains controlling the
disk cooling efficiency evolve simultaneously.

heads in a teacher-student framework. For the classification head, OCL
(Object-wise Contrastive Learning) regularizes the object representation
learning that utilizes unlabeled data to improve pseudo-label filtering by
enhancing the discriminativeness of the classification score. This is designed
to pull together objects in the same class and push away objects from different
classes. For the regression head, we further propose RUPL
(Regression-Uncertainty-guided Pseudo-Labeling) to learn the aleatoric
uncertainty of object localization for label filtering. By jointly filtering
the pseudo-labels for the classification and regression heads, the student
network receives better guidance from the teacher network for object detection
task. Experimental results on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method with competitive performance compared to
existing methods.

sources, using the uncertainty of information (UoI) as the performance metric.
Measured by Shannon's entropy, UoI can capture not only the transition dynamics
of the Markov source but also the different evolutions of information quality
caused by the different values of the last observation. We consider an
information update system with M finite-state Markov sources transmitting
information to a remote monitor via m communication channels. Our goal is to
explore the optimal scheduling policy to minimize the sum-UoI of the Markov
sources. The problem is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB). We
relax the RMAB and then decouple the relaxed problem into M single bandit
problems. Analyzing the single bandit problem provides useful properties with
which the relaxed problem reduces to maximizing a concave and piecewise linear
function, allowing us to develop a gradient method to solve the relaxed problem
and obtain its optimal policy. By rounding up the optimal policy for the
relaxed problem, we obtain an index policy for the original RMAB problem.
Notably, the proposed index policy is universal in the sense that it applies to
general RMABs with bounded cost functions.

widely acknowledged challenge. In response, personalized federated learning
(PFL) emerged as a framework to curate local models for clients' tasks. In PFL,
a common strategy is to develop local and global models jointly - the global
model (for generalization) informs the local models, and the local models (for
personalization) are aggregated to update the global model. A key observation
is that if we can improve the generalization ability of local models, then we
can improve the generalization of global models, which in turn builds better
personalized models. In this work, we consider class imbalance, an overlooked
type of data heterogeneity, in the classification setting. We propose FedNH, a
novel method that improves the local models' performance for both
personalization and generalization by combining the uniformity and semantics of
class prototypes. FedNH initially distributes class prototypes uniformly in the
latent space and smoothly infuses the class semantics into class prototypes. We
show that imposing uniformity helps to combat prototype collapse while infusing
class semantics improves local models. Extensive experiments were conducted on
popular classification datasets under the cross-device setting. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method over recent works.

the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We developed a novel model, KIRESH,
that has shown to substantially outperform other state-of-the-art models such

Moreover, we designed a novel prompt to further improve the model performance
by using the intrinsic connection between the two sub-tasks of eviction
presence and period prediction. Finally, we used the Temperature Scaling-based
Calibration on our KIRESH-Prompt method to avoid over-confidence issues arising

  Results: KIRESH-Prompt substantially outperformed strong baseline models

conducted additional experiments on a benchmark social determinants of health

  Conclusion and Future Work: KIRESH-Prompt has substantially improved eviction
status classification. We plan to deploy KIRESH-Prompt to the VHA EHRs as an

the bit selection in determining the quantization precision of each layer. The
continuous sparsification scheme enables fully-differentiable training without

budget-aware regularization of total model size enables the dynamic growth and
pruning of each layer's precision towards a mixed-precision quantization scheme

next-generation spintronics and magnonics applications. Here, we demonstrate a
giant gate-tunable renormalization of spin-correlated flat-band states and
bandgap in magnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3) monolayers grown on graphene.
Our gate-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) studies reveal that
the inter-flat-band spacing and bandgap of CrBr3 can be continuously tuned by
120 meV and 240 meV respectively via electrostatic injection of carriers into
the hybrid CrBr3/graphene system, equivalent to the modulation of the Cr
on-site Coulomb repulsion energy by 500 meV. This can be attributed to the
self-screening of CrBr3 arising from the gate-induced carriers injected into
CrBr3, which dominates over the opposite trend from the remote screening of the
graphene substrate. Precise tuning of the spin-correlated flat-band states and
bandgap in 2D magnets via electrostatic modulation of Coulomb interactions not

also may exert a crucial influence on the exchange energy and spin-wave gap,

that the simultaneous inclusion of rotation and interactions produces
nontrivial changes in the quantum vacuum energy. Besides expected changes
(where, as the size of the ring increases for fixed interaction strength, the

optimizing immediate engagement. However, long-term user engagement, a more
desirable performance metric, remains difficult to improve. Meanwhile, recent
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown their effectiveness in a
variety of long-term goal optimization tasks. For this reason, RL is widely
considered as a promising framework for optimizing long-term user engagement in
recommendation. Though promising, the application of RL heavily relies on
well-designed rewards, but designing rewards related to long-term user
engagement is quite difficult. To mitigate the problem, we propose a novel
paradigm, recommender systems with human preferences (or Preference-based
Recommender systems), which allows RL recommender systems to learn from
preferences about users historical behaviors rather than explicitly defined
rewards. Such preferences are easily accessible through techniques such as
crowdsourcing, as they do not require any expert knowledge. With PrefRec, we
can fully exploit the advantages of RL in optimizing long-term goals, while
avoiding complex reward engineering. PrefRec uses the preferences to
automatically train a reward function in an end-to-end manner. The reward
function is then used to generate learning signals to train the recommendation
policy. Furthermore, we design an effective optimization method for PrefRec,
which uses an additional value function, expectile regression and reward model
pre-training to improve the performance. We conduct experiments on a variety of
long-term user engagement optimization tasks. The results show that PrefRec
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in all the tasks.

(DNNs) on edge devices, quantization is widely regarded as one promising
technique. It reduces the resource requirements for computational power and

lower bit-width fixed-point numbers, resulting in quantized neural networks
(QNNs). While it has been empirically shown to introduce minor accuracy loss,
critical verified properties of a DNN might become invalid once quantized.
Existing verification methods focus on either individual neural networks (DNNs

propose a quantization error bound verification method, named QEBVerif, where
both weights and activation tensors are quantized. QEBVerif consists of two
parts, i.e., a differential reachability analysis (DRA) and a mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP) based verification method. DRA performs difference
analysis between the DNN and its quantized counterpart layer-by-layer to
compute a tight quantization error interval efficiently. If DRA fails to prove
the error bound, then we encode the verification problem into an equivalent
MILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Thus, QEBVerif is
sound, complete, and reasonably efficient. We implement QEBVerif and conduct

transformer struggles to capture details in time series and presents inferior
performance. Based on this observation, we make a series of evolution on the
basic architecture of the vanilla MTSF transformer. We vary the flawed
tokenization strategy, along with the decoder structure and embeddings.
Surprisingly, the evolved simple transformer architecture is highly effective,
which successfully avoids the over-smoothing phenomena in the vanilla MTSF

substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformers that are

ferruginous chemical gardens to accumulate nucleic acids via sorption. The
injection of an alkaline solution into an artificial ferruginous solution under
anoxic conditions (O2 <0.01% of present atmospheric levels) and at ambient

converted to chloride-containing fougerite (green rust). RNA was only
extractable from the ferruginous solution in the presence of a phosphate

However, there are many real-world applications where frame sequences are not

the depth ambiguity by generating multiple 3D pose candidates which can be

further performance improvements. We evaluate our method on the widely adopted

shape-aware face swapping, namely FlowFace. Unlike most previous methods that
focus on transferring the source inner facial features but neglect facial
contours, our FlowFace can transfer both of them to a target face, thus leading
to more realistic face swapping. Concretely, our FlowFace consists of a face
reshaping network and a face swapping network. The face reshaping network
addresses the shape outline differences between the source and target faces. It
first estimates a semantic flow (i.e., face shape differences) between the
source and the target face, and then explicitly warps the target face shape
with the estimated semantic flow. After reshaping, the face swapping network
generates inner facial features that exhibit the identity of the source face.
We employ a pre-trained face masked autoencoder (MAE) to extract facial
features from both the source face and the target face. In contrast to previous
methods that use identity embedding to preserve identity information, the
features extracted by our encoder can better capture facial appearances and
identity information. Then, we develop a cross-attention fusion module to
adaptively fuse inner facial features from the source face with the target
facial attributes, thus leading to better identity preservation. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on in-the-wild faces demonstrate that
our FlowFace outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.

achieved state-of-the-art performances, they explicitly minimize the risk of
classifying unlabeled data as negative samples, which might result in a
negative-prediction preference of the classifier. To alleviate this issue, we
resort to a label distribution perspective for PU learning in this paper.
Noticing that the label distribution of unlabeled data is fixed when the class
prior is known, it can be naturally used as learning supervision for the model.
Motivated by this, we propose to pursue the label distribution consistency
between predicted and ground-truth label distributions, which is formulated by
aligning their expectations. Moreover, we further adopt the entropy
minimization and Mixup regularization to avoid the trivial solution of the
label distribution consistency on unlabeled data and mitigate the consequent

Although the valley dynamics of intralayer and interlayer excitons (IXs) have
been studied, efficient manipulation of valley pseudospins by switching exciton
states remains elusive. Therefore, it is of great importance to effectively
tune the exciton states to obtain practical valley polarization switches for
valley encoding. Here, we demonstrate the electrical switching of exciton
emission with highly variable valley polarization mediated by charged IXs
(CIXs) in the heterostructure of monolayer WS2 and two-dimensional (2D)
perovskite, irrespective of lattice constants, the rotational and translational
alignment. The formation of IXs is identified by photoluminescence excitation
(PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) studies, which can be further electrically
tuned from positively charged to negatively charged depending on the
electrostatic doping level of monolayer WS2. Importantly, we demonstrate an
electrical switching from type two to type one band alignment, manifesting as a
change in the PL profile from CIX to charged intralayer exciton emission. Such
transition induces a large contrast in valley polarization between the two
exciton states, enabling the reversible electrically regulated valley
polarization switch with a maximum ON/OFF ratio of 15.8. Our study provides an
alternative mechanism to achieve valley polarization switching with great
simplicity for valleytronics and the electrical control of exciton species and

training data, which requires unaffordable manual labeling costs in large
aerial scenes with dense objects. Active learning is effective in reducing the
data labeling cost by selectively querying the informative and representative
unlabelled samples. However, existing active learning methods are mainly with
class-balanced setting and image-based querying for generic object detection
tasks, which are less applicable to aerial object detection scenario due to the
long-tailed class distribution and dense small objects in aerial scenes. In
this paper, we propose a novel active learning method for cost-effective aerial
object detection. Specifically, both object-level and image-level
informativeness are considered in the object selection to refrain from
redundant and myopic querying. Besides, an easy-to-use class-balancing
criterion is incorporated to favor the minority objects to alleviate the
long-tailed class distribution problem in model training. To fully utilize the
queried information, we further devise a training loss to mine the latent
knowledge in the undiscovered image regions. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the DOTA-v1.0 and DOTA-v2.0 benchmarks to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that it can save more

ferrimagnets, and we study theoretically and numerically the dynamics of the
HMS driven by spin-orbit torque. It is revealed that the skyrmion Hall effect
depends on the skyrmion helicity and the net angular momentum ({\delta}s),
allowing the effective modulation of the HMS motion through tuning
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and {\delta}s. Thus, the Hall effect can be
suppressed through selecting suitable materials to better control the HMS
motion. Moreover, Magnus force for finite {\delta}s suppresses the transverse
motion and enhances the longitudinal propagation, resulting in the HMS dynamics
in ferrimagnets faster than that in antiferromagnets.

retaining only spin-diagonal part of the spin-orbit (SO) coupling. We start our
analysis with the magnetic force theorem (MFT), which relies on additional
approximations resulting in the linear dependence of the exchange interactions
on the response tensor, and compare it with the exact approach formulated in
terms of the inverse response. We propose the downfolding procedure
transferring the effect of these ligand spins into parameters of effective
interactions between the localized spins. These techniques are applied for the
series of CrCl$_3$ and CrI$_3$ based materials, including bulk, monolayer,
bilayer, and three-layer systems. Particularly, we discuss how the DM
interactions are induced by the inversion symmetry breaking at the surface or
by the electric field. As long as the SO interaction of the heavy ligand atoms
is taken into account in the calculations of the response tensor between the Cr
$3d$ states, the MFT appears to be a good approximation for the DM
interactions, being in contrast with the isotropic exchange, for which MFT and
the exact method provide quite a different description. Finally, we discuss the
relevance of our approach to other techniques ever proposed for calculations of
the DM interactions. Particularly, we argue that the spin-current model for the
DM interactions can be derived from the MFT based expression and is the
relativistic counterpart of the double exchange, occurring in metallic systems
in the limit of infinite exchange splitting.

degrades the system performance. Meanwhile, rate-splitting (RS), exploiting the
transmission of both common and private messages, has demonstrated to offer
considerable spectral efficiency (SE) improvements and its robustness against
channel state information (CSI) imperfection. The signal performance of a CF
massive MIMO system is first analyzed for asynchronous reception capturing the
joint effects of propagation delays and oscillator phases of transceivers.
Taking into account the imperfect CSI caused by asynchronous phases and pilot
contamination, we derive novel and closed-form downlink SE expressions for
characterizing the performance of both the RS-assisted and conventional
non-RS-based systems adopting coherent and non-coherent data transmission
schemes, respectively. Moreover, we formulate the design of robust precoding
for the common messages as an optimization problem that maximizes the minimum
individual SE of the common message. To address the non-convexity of the design

Simulation results show that asynchronous reception indeed destroys both the
orthogonality of the pilots and the coherent data transmission resulting in
poor system performance. Besides, thanks to the uniform coverage properties of
CF massive MIMO systems, RS with a simple low-complexity precoding for the
common message obtained by the equal ratio sum of the private precoding is able
to achieve substantial downlink sum SE gains, while the application of robust

the dust-charge fluctuation is a semi-random phenomena, fluctuating about some

points to the fact that these fluctuations can be driven externally by changing
electron and ion currents to the dust particles. With the help of a

the machinery that can then compute constrainable CMB signal power spectra
including spectral distortions for single energy injection and decaying
particle scenarios. Our results show that the $\mu \times T$ and $y\times T$
power spectra reach levels that can be constrained with current and future CMB
experiments without violating existing constraints from COBE/FIRAS. The
amplitude of the cross-correlation signal directly depends on the average
distortion level, therefore establishing a novel fundamental link between the
state of the primordial plasma from redshift $10^3 \lesssim z\lesssim 3\times
10^6$ and the frequency-dependent CMB sky. This provides a new method to
constrain average early energy release using CMB imagers. As an example we
derive constraints on single energy release and decaying particle scenarios.
This shows that LiteBIRD may be able to improve the energy release limits of
COBE/FIRAS by up to a factor of $\simeq 2.5$, while PICO could tighten the
constraints by more than one order of magnitude. The signals considered here

Although considerable progress has been made on robust steganography against

introducing a metric - the degree of pixel involvement (dPI) to identify the

in nanopores formed of sinusoidally-shaped walls (with amplitude $A$ and period
$P$) is governed by the wall mean separation $L$ as follows. For $L>L_t$, where
$L_t$ increases with $A$, the pores exhibit standard capillary condensation
similar to planar slits. In contrast, for $L<L_t$, the condensation occurs in
two steps, such that the fluid first condenses locally via bridging transition
connecting adjacent crests of the walls, before it condenses globally. For the
marginal value of $L=L_t$, all the three phases (gas-like, bridge and
liquid-like) may coexist. We show that the locations of the phase transitions
can be described using geometric arguments leading to modified Kelvin
equations. However, for completely wet walls, to which we focus on, the phase
boundaries are shifted significantly due to the presence of wetting layers. In
order to take this into account, mesoscopic corrections to the macroscopic
theory are proposed. The resulting predictions are shown to be in a very good
agreement with a density functional theory even for molecularly narrow pores.

and is regarded as a significant political phenomenon; however, its mechanism
remains underexplored. Therefore, this study examines how social media users
respond to changes in political leadership in order to better understand the
honeymoon effect in politics. In particular, we constructed a 15-year Twitter
dataset on eight change timings of Japanese prime ministers consisting of 6.6M
tweets and analyzed them in terms of sentiments, topics, and users. We found
that, while not always, social media tend to show a honeymoon effect at the
change timings of prime minister. The study also revealed that sentiment about
prime ministers differed by topic, indicating that public expectations vary
from one prime minister to another. Furthermore, the user base was largely
replaced before and after the change in the prime minister, and their sentiment
was also significantly different. The implications of this study would be
beneficial for administrative management.

However, in wireless networks, the above mechanism may lead to prolonged

of two major elements, namely a modified Ring All-reduce (MRAR) architecture

temperature increases with decreasing gravity. This is because a lower-gravity
planet has larger water vapor content and more clouds, resulting in a larger
clear-sky greenhouse effect and a stronger cloud warming effect in the small

the convection shifts from a quasi-steady state to an oscillatory state. In the
oscillatory state, there are convection cycles with a period of several days,
comprised of a short wet phase with intense surface precipitation and a dry
phase with no surface precipitation. When convection shifts to the oscillatory
state, water vapor content and high-level cloud fraction increase
substantially, resulting in rapid warming. After the transition to the
oscillatory state, the cloud net positive radiative effect decreases with
increasing stellar flux, which indicates a stabilizing climate effect. In the
quasi-steady state, the atmospheric absorption features of CO$_2$ are more
detectable on lower-gravity planets because of their larger atmospheric
heights. While in the oscillatory state, the high-level clouds mute almost all
the absorption features, making the atmospheric components hard to be

feature of classic PD-PSAs. In addition, by this balance, BALPA eliminates the
inefficiency of classic PD-PSAs for composite optimization problems in which
the Euclidean norm of the linear mapping or the equality constraint mapping is
large. Therefore, BALPA not only inherits the advantages of simple structure
and easy implementation of classic PD-PSAs but also ensures a fast convergence
when these norms are large. Moreover, we propose a stochastic version of BALPA
(S-BALPA) and apply the developed BALPA to distributed optimization to devise a
new distributed optimization algorithm. Furthermore, a comprehensive
convergence analysis for BALPA and S-BALPA is conducted, respectively. Finally,
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

separate models for different motion synthesis tasks, and typically use a model

It remains an open question whether developing a single unified model is
feasible, which may 1) benefit the acquirement of novel skills by combining
skills learned from multiple tasks, and 2) help in increasing the model
capacity without overfitting by combining multiple data sources. Unification is
challenging because 1) it involves diverse control signals as well as targets
of varying granularity, and 2) motion datasets may use different skeletons and
default poses. In this paper, we present MoFusion, a framework for unified
motion synthesis. MoFusion employs a Transformer backbone to ease the inclusion
of diverse control signals via cross attention, and pretrains the backbone as a
diffusion model to support multi-granularity synthesis ranging from motion
completion of a body part to whole-body motion generation. It uses a learnable
adapter to accommodate the differences between the default skeletons used by
the pretraining and the fine-tuning data. Empirical results show that
pretraining is vital for scaling the model size without overfitting, and
demonstrate MoFusion's potential in various tasks, e.g., text-to-motion, motion

dominant $S$ and $P$ waves provide main and non-relativistic contrition to the
decays, other partial waves mainly contribute to the relativistic correction.
For the states, like the $\psi(1D)$, $\Upsilon(2D)$, $\chi_{c2}(1F)$ and
$\chi_{b2}(1F)$, etc, they are the $S-P-D$ mixing states dominated by the $D$
wave or the $P-D-F$ mixing states dominated by the $F$ wave. The contribution
of $P$ wave in the former and $D$ wave in the later are small. So in a rough
calculation, their contribution can be ignored, then the mixing states
degenerate into the usual $S-D$ and $P-F$ mixtures. And large mixing angles
around $|\theta|\sim 30^\circ$ for them are obtained. Large decay widths are
found in the transitions $\psi(2D)\to \chi_{c2}(1F)$, $\Upsilon(1D)\to

hybridization between intra- and interlayer excitons can be 'unmixed' due to
the interaction with photons. We predict formation of polaritons where > 90% of
the total excitonic contribution is stemming from the interlayer exciton.
Furthermore, we explore the conditions on the tunneling strength and exciton

oscillator strength of the underlying interlayer exciton, optical energy can be
effectively fed into the polaritons once the critical coupling condition of

properties were considered in two regimes: when the intensities of many-body
interactions are either weak or strong. The weak regime was studied using the
mean-field approximation with self-consistent solutions carried out both in the
uniform case and taking into account of the boundary of the finite
square-shaped system. It is shown that in the uniform case the topologically
nontrivial phase on the phase diagram is widened by the Coulomb repulsion. The
boundary effect, resulting in an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the
correlators, leads to the appearance of the crossover from the symmetric
spin-independent solution to the spin-dependent one characterized by a
spontaneously broken symmetry. In the former the corner states have energies
that are determined by the overlap of the excitation wave functions localized
at the different corners. In the latter the corner excitation energy is defined
by the Coulomb repulsion intensity with a quadratic law. The crossover is a
finite size effect, i.e. the larger the system the lesser the critical value of
the Coulomb repulsion. In the strong repulsion regime we derive the effective
HOTSC Hamiltonian in the atomic representation and found a rich variety of
interactions induced by virtual processes between the lower and upper Hubbard
subbands. It is shown that Majorana corner modes still can be realized in the

mixed samples of an intermediate domain, thus encouraging to learn
domain-invariant knowledge. Then, in the second stage, we further enhance the
model for better generalization on the unlabeled target set. This is achieved
by exploring Intra-domain Point-MixUp in semi-supervised learning, which
essentially regularizes the pseudo label distribution. Experiments from Waymo
to nuScenes show that, with only 10% labeled target data, our SSDA3D can
surpass the fully-supervised oracle model with 100% target label. Our code is

learning of multiple tasks of different nature. Recently, various heuristic
tricks, both from machine learning and from neuroscience angles, were proposed,
but they lack a unified theory ground. Here, we focus on the continual learning
in single-layered and multi-layered neural networks of binary weights. A
variational Bayesian learning setting is thus proposed, where the neural
network is trained in a field-space, rather than the gradient-ill-defined
discrete-weight space, and furthermore, the weight uncertainty is naturally
incorporated, and modulates the synaptic resources among tasks. From a physics
perspective, we translate the variational continual learning into the
Franz-Parisi thermodynamic potential framework, where the previous task
knowledge acts as a prior and a reference as well. We thus interprete the
continual learning of the binary perceptron in a teacher-student setting as a
Franz-Parisi potential computation. The learning performance can then be
analytically studied with mean-field order parameters, whose predictions
coincide with the numerical experiments using stochastic gradient descent
methods. Based on the variational principle and Gaussian field approximation of
internal preactivations in hidden layers, we also derive the learning algorithm
considering weight uncertainty, which outperforms the current metaplasticity
algorithm in continually learning multiple tasks. Our proposed principled
frameworks also connect to elastic weight consolidation, and neuroscience
inspired metaplasticity, providing a theory-grounded method for the real-world
multi-task learning with deep networks.

two types of new hypercontractivity in this paper. The first one is an
improvement of Borell's reverse hypercontractivity inequality in terms of
Nelson's time relation under the restriction that the inputs have an
appropriate symmetry. We then prove that it implies the Blaschke--Santal\'{o}

Brascamp--Lieb inequality due to Barthe--Wolff beyond their non-degenerate

with exponents below 1 for the inputs which are log-convex and
semi-log-concave. This yields new lower bounds of the volume product for convex
bodies whose boundaries are well curved. This consequence provides a
quantitative result of works by Stancu and Reisner--Sch\""{u}tt--Werner where

possibly unobservable response variables in the data, where the mechanism that
causes the absence of information is unknown and can depend on both predictors
and the response variables. Our proposed approach involves two steps: In the
first step, we construct a family of models (possibly infinite dimensional)
indexed by the unknown parameter of the missing probability mechanism. In the
second step, a search is carried out to find the empirically optimal member of
an appropriate cover (or subclass) of the underlying family in the sense of
minimizing the mean squared prediction error. The main focus of the paper is to
look into the theoretical properties of these estimators. The issue of
identifiability is also addressed. Our methods use a data-splitting approach
which is quite easy to implement. We also derive exponential bounds on the
performance of the resulting estimators in terms of their deviations from the
true regression curve in general Lp norms, where we also allow the size of the
cover or subclass to diverge as the sample size n increases. These bounds
immediately yield various strong convergence results for the proposed
estimators. As an application of our findings, we consider the problem of
statistical classification based on the proposed regression estimators and also
look into their rates of convergence under different settings. Although this
work is mainly stated for kernel-type estimators, they can also be extended to
other popular local-averaging methods such as nearest-neighbor estimators, and
histogram estimators.

two-species alliances whose members either beat each other mutually via a
bidirectional invasion or they exchange their positions during an inner

the model parameter $p$, which characterizes the inner invasions, and $\beta$,

rock-scissors-paper-type solutions emerge, where one of the members is
oppressed by having the smallest average concentration due to heterogeneous
inner invasion rates. Interestingly, however, if we allow a more intensive site

dominate the full parameter plane. We show that their victory utilizes the
vulnerability of the rival alliance based on cyclic dominance, where a species

written in space with movement of the finger. It can be seen as a special case
of dynamic gesture recognition wherein the set of gestures are letters in a
particular language. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive approach
used to capture electrical signals generated as a result of contraction and
relaxation of the muscles. sEMG has been widely adopted for gesture recognition
applications. Unlike static gestures, dynamic gestures are user-friendly and
can be used as a method for input with applications in Human Computer
Interaction. There has been limited work in recognition of dynamic gestures
such as airwriting, using sEMG signals and forms the core of the current work.
In this work, a multi-loss minimization framework for sEMG based airwriting
recognition is proposed. The proposed framework aims at learning a feature
embedding vector that minimizes the triplet loss, while simultaneously learning
the parameters of a classifier head to recognize corresponding alphabets. The
proposed method is validated on a dataset recorded in the lab comprising of
sEMG signals from 50 participants writing English uppercase alphabets. The
effect of different variations of triplet loss, triplet mining strategies and
feature embedding dimension is also presented. The best-achieved accuracy was

problem in an infinite rectangular grid setting. The previous works in
literature dealing with \textsc{Apf} problem in infinite grid had a fundamental
issue. These deterministic algorithms use a lot of space in the grid to solve
the problem mainly because of maintaining the asymmetry of the configuration or
to avoid a collision. These solution techniques can not be useful if there is a

carefully designed a deterministic algorithm that solves the \textsc{Apf}

a future quantum internet. It will become a widely accepted phenomenon as
quantum repeater networks become increasingly efficient. Graph theoretical
approaches to make a feasible multi-node quantum network for secure
communication and distributed quantum computation are exciting, as the
classical internet was built on such theories. Unlike today's classical
internet, a quantum internet will likely rely on more than one path between the
source and destination. This multi-path routing paradigm allows the user-pair
to send their Bell-pairs through pathways other than the shortest one and still
get a single high-fidelity Bell-pair at the end via entanglement purification.
This study encompasses a quintessential comparative analysis of having more
than the minimum required edges in networks to support multi-path routing with
quantum memories. We explain the benefits of having redundant edges in tree
networks by adding rings of edges at each level and comparing cost distances
with that of lattice networks. Our analysis provides an understanding of
fidelity-efficiency trade-offs in the context of user competition and
path-finding probabilities. We argue that network topologies are essential in
serving the entanglement distribution. To show the deployability of large-scale
quantum communication networks, we present a $14$-node network in Islamabad in
two fibre-optic-based networks. One is the minimal spanning tree topology that
costs around $\$61,370.00$, and the other is a complete graph topology, which
costs about $\$1.1\text{Mil}$. It shows that the network topologies can
significantly improve key generation rates, even when memory is unavailable.

two voter-like models of opinion dynamics: an Incoming model (where individuals

choose who to send opinions to). We show that individuals can bias group-level
outcomes in their favor by breaking disagreeing links while receiving opinions
(Incoming Model) and retaining disagreeing links while sending opinions
(Outgoing Model). Importantly, these biases can help the population avoid
stalemates and achieve consensus. However, the role of disagreement avoidance
is diluted in the presence of strong preferences - highly stubborn individuals

supporting the physical layer of wireless communication systems. Thus, it is of
interest to examine the information-carrying capability of continuous EM
fields, which motivates research on EM information theory (EIT). In this
article, we systematically investigate the basic ideas and main results of EIT.
First, we review the fundamental analytical tools of classical information
theory and EM theory. Then, we introduce the modeling and analysis
methodologies of EIT, including continuous field modeling, degree of freedom,
mutual information, and capacity analyses. After that, several EIT-inspired
applications are discussed to illustrate how EIT guides the design of practical
wireless systems. Finally, we point out several open problems of EIT, where
further research efforts are required for EIT to construct a unified
interdisciplinary theory.

In the SUBSET SUM problem, a (multi-)set $X$ of $n$ positive numbers and a
target number $t$ are given, and the task is to find a subset of $X$ with the
maximal sum that does not exceed $t$. It is well known that this problem is
NP-hard and admits fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTASs). In
recent years, it has been shown that there does not exist an FPTAS of running
time $\tilde\OO( 1/\epsilon^{2-\delta})$ for arbitrary small $\delta>0$
assuming ($\min$,+)-convolution conjecture~\cite{bringmann2021fine}. However,
the lower bound can be bypassed if we relax the constraint such that the task
is to find a subset of $X$ that can slightly exceed the threshold $t$ by
$\epsilon$ times, and the sum of numbers within the subset is at least
$1-\tilde\OO(\epsilon)$ times the optimal objective value that respects the
constraint. Approximation schemes that may violate the constraint are also
known as weak approximation schemes. For the SUBSET SUM problem, there is a
randomized weak approximation scheme running in time $\tilde\OO(n+
1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ [Mucha et al.'19]. For the special case where the target $t$
is half of the summation of all input numbers, weak approximation schemes are
equivalent to approximation schemes that do not violate the constraint, and the
best-known algorithm runs in $\tilde\OO(n+1/\epsilon^{{3}/{2}})$ time
[Bringmann and Nakos'21].

relation that connects their star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses

relations would imply a drastic change in the processes that regulate galaxy
evolution. Observations have hinted at the possibility that this relation may
be broken in the very early universe. However, until recently, chemical
abundances of galaxies could be only measured reliably as far back as redshift
$z=3.3$. With JWST, we can now characterize the SFR, $M_\star$, and chemical
abundance of galaxies during the first few hundred million years after the Big
Bang, at redshifts $z=7-10$. Here we show that galaxies at this epoch follow
unique SFR-$M_\star$--main-sequence and mass-metallicity scaling relations, but
their chemical abundance is a factor of three lower than expected from the
fundamental-metallicity relation of later galaxies. These findings suggest that
galaxies at this time are still intimately connected with the intergalactic
medium and subject to continuous infall of pristine gas which effectively
dilutes their metal abundances.

update model weights often assuming the same level of reliability for each
source; that is: a model does not consider data quality of each source during
training. In many applications, sources can have varied levels of noise or
corruption that has negative effects on the learning of a robust deep learning
model. A key issue is that the quality of data or labels for individual sources
is often not available during training and could vary over time. Our solution
to this problem is to consider the mistakes made while training on data
originating from sources and utilise this to create a perceived data quality
for each source. This paper demonstrates a straight-forward and novel technique
that can be applied to any gradient descent optimiser: Update model weights as
a function of the perceived reliability of data sources within a wider data
set. The algorithm controls the plasticity of a given model to weight updates
based on the history of losses from individual data sources. We show that
applying this technique can significantly improve model performance when
trained on a mixture of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain
performance when models are trained on data sources that are all considered
reliable. All code to reproduce this work's experiments and implement the
algorithm in the reader's own models is made available.

be widely used for document understanding and information retrieval. Existing
works often use hand-crafted features and predefined rule-based functions to
detect headings and resolve the hierarchical relationship between headings.
Both the benchmark and research based on deep learning are still limited.
Accordingly, in this paper, we first introduce a standard dataset, HierDoc,
including image samples from 650 documents of scientific papers with their
content labels. Then we propose a novel end-to-end model by using the
multimodal tree decoder (MTD) for ToC as a benchmark for HierDoc. The MTD model
is mainly composed of three parts, namely encoder, classifier, and decoder. The
encoder fuses the multimodality features of vision, text, and layout
information for each entity of the document. Then the classifier recognizes and
selects the heading entities. Next, to parse the hierarchical relationship
between the heading entities, a tree-structured decoder is designed. To
evaluate the performance, both the metric of tree-edit-distance similarity
(TEDS) and F1-Measure are adopted. Finally, our MTD approach achieves an
average TEDS of 87.2% and an average F1-Measure of 88.1% on the test set of
HierDoc. The code and dataset will be released at:

through the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism using an aerosol of catalyst
nanoparticles. These conditions lead to ultrafast growth at 8.5 {\mu}m/s
(maximum of 50 {\mu}m/s), which is up to 3 orders of magnitude above
conventional substrate-based chemical vapour deposition. The high aspect ratio
of the nanowires (up to 2200) favours their entanglement and the formation of
freestanding network materials consisting entirely of SiCNWs. The floating
catalyst chemical vapour deposition growth process is rationalised through
in-situ sampling of reaction products and catalyst aerosol from the gas phase,
and thermodynamic calculations of the bulk ternary Si-C-Fe phase diagram. The
phase diagram suggests a description of the mechanistic path for the selective
growth of SiCNWs, consistent with the observation that no other types of
nanowires (Si or C) are grown by the catalyst. SiCNW growth occurs at 1130
{\deg}C, close to the calculated eutectic. According to the calculated phase
diagram, upon addition of Si and C, the Fe-rich liquid segregates a carbon
shell, and later enrichment of the liquid in Si leads to the formation of SiC.
The exceptionally fast growth rate relative to substrate-based processes is
attributed to the increased availability of precursors for incorporation into
the catalyst due to the high collision rate inherent to this new synthesis
mode.

formal basic opens and then lift it to the whole lattice. This general strategy
is used in a plethora of textbooks, but formalizing it has proved tricky. The

different sky surveys totaling more than 1 million targets for which we search
for Gaia DR3 Non-single Star orbital solutions with periods substantially
longer than the eclipsing periods of the binaries. Those solutions in most
cases should belong to outer orbits of tertiary stars in those systems. We also
try to validate some of our best-suited candidates using TESS eclipse timing
variations. Results. We find 403 objects with suitable Gaia orbital solutions
of which 27 are already known triple systems. This makes 376 newly identified
hierarchical triple system candidates in our sample. We analyze the cumulative
probability distribution of the outer orbit eccentricities and find that it is
very similar to the ones found by earlier studies based on the observations of
the Kepler and OGLE missions. We found measurable non-linear eclipse timing
variations or third-body eclipses in the TESS data for 192 objects which we
also consider to be confirmed candidates. Out of these, we construct analytical

flows is widespread in academic and commercial simulation software because of
its many advantages: a high degree of volume conservation, applicability to
unstructured domain discretization (relevant for engineering applications),
straightforward parallel implementation with the domain-decomposition and
message-passing approach (important for large-scale simulations), and intrinsic
handling of strong deformations and topological changes of the fluid interface.
However, stable and accurate handling of small-scale capillary flows (dominated
by surface tension forces) is still challenging for VoF methods. With many
different VoF methods making their way into commercial and open-source
software, it becomes increasingly important to compare them quantitatively and
directly. For this purpose, we propose a set of simulation benchmarks and use
them to directly compare VoF methods available in OpenFOAM, Basilisk, and Ansys
Fluent. We use Jupyter notebooks to document and process the benchmark results,
making a direct comparison of our results with other two-phase simulation
methods very straightforward. The publicly available input data, secondary
benchmark data, and post-processing Jupyter notebooks can be re-used by any
two-phase flow simulation method that discretizes two-phase Navier-Stokes
equations in a one-fluid formulation, which can save a significant amount of

to examine the humanness of current autonomous cars. The present study tested
whether the AI driver could create a human-like ride experience for passengers
based on 69 participants' feedback in a real-road scenario. We designed a ride
experience-based version of the non-verbal Turing test for automated driving.
Participants rode in autonomous cars (driven by either human or AI drivers) as
a passenger and judged whether the driver was human or AI. The AI driver failed
to pass our test because passengers detected the AI driver above chance. In
contrast, when the human driver drove the car, the passengers' judgement was
around chance. We further investigated how human passengers ascribe humanness
in our test. Based on Lewin's field theory, we advanced a computational model
combining signal detection theory with pre-trained language models to predict
passengers' humanness rating behaviour. We employed affective transition
between pre-study baseline emotions and corresponding post-stage emotions as
the signal strength of our model. Results showed that the passengers'
ascription of humanness would increase with the greater affective transition.

the other hand, for the non-relativistic models, the Lanczos coefficients
initially grow linearly for small $n$'s, then reach a plateau. Although this
looks like the behavior of a chaotic system, it is mostly likely due to
saddle-dominated scrambling effects instead, as argued in the literature. In

a bound by the temperature. During our study, we also provide an alternative

trajectory data that allows an effective visualization and characterization of
city-wide traffic dynamics. With the advance of sensor, mobile, and Internet of
Things (IoT) technologies, vehicle and passenger trajectories are being
increasingly collected on a massive scale and are becoming a critical source of
insight into traffic pattern and traveller behaviour. To leverage such
trajectory data to better understand traffic dynamics in a large-scale urban
network, this study develops a trajectory-based network traffic analysis method
that converts individual trajectory data into a sequence of graphs that evolve
over time (known as dynamic graphs or time-evolving graphs) and analyses
network-wide traffic patterns in terms of a compact and informative
graph-representation of aggregated traffic flows. First, we partition the
entire network into a set of cells based on the spatial distribution of data
points in individual trajectories, where the cells represent spatial regions
between which aggregated traffic flows can be measured. Next, dynamic flows of
moving objects are represented as a time-evolving graph, where regions are
graph vertices and flows between them are treated as weighted directed edges.
Given a fixed set of vertices, edges can be inserted or removed at every time
step depending on the presence of traffic flows between two regions at a given
time window. Once a dynamic graph is built, we apply graph mining algorithms to
detect change-points in time, which represent time points where the graph
exhibits significant changes in its overall structure and, thus, correspond to
change-points in city-wide mobility pattern throughout the day (e.g., global
transition points between peak and off-peak periods).

solutions of the anomaly matching and persistent mass equations called
$N_f$-independence. The validity of $N_f$-independence was assumed based on
qualitative arguments, but it was never proven rigorously. We provide a
detailed proof and clarify under which (dynamical) conditions it holds. Our
result is valid for a generic spectrum of massless composite fermions including
baryons and exotics. We then present a novel argument that does not require any
dynamical assumption and is based on downlifting solutions to smaller values of
$N_f$. When applied to QCD ($N_c=3)$, our theorem implies that chiral symmetry
must be spontaneously broken for $3\leq N_f<N_f^{CFT}$, where $N_f^{CFT}$ is
the lower edge of the conformal window. A second argument is also presented
based on continuity, which assumes the absence of phase transitions when the
quark masses are sent to infinity. When applied to QCD, this result explains
why chiral symmetry is broken for $N_f=2$, despite integer solutions of the
equations exist in this case. Explicit examples and a numerical analysis are

interaction is a friction-like term of the form $\Gamma(\phi)=\mu \phi^{2p}$,
$\mu>0$, $p\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. The analysis relies on the introduction of
a new regular 3-dimensional dynamical systems' formulation of the Einstein
equations on a compact state space, and the use of dynamical systems' tools
such as quasi-homogeneous blow-ups and averaging methods involving a
time-dependent perturbation parameter. We find a bifurcation at $p=n/2$ due to
the influence of the interaction term. In general, this term has more impact on
the future (past) asymptotics for $p<n/2$ ($p>n/2$). For $p<n/2$ we find a
complexity of possible future attractors, which depends on whether $p=(n-1)/2$
or $p<(n-1)/2$. In the first case the future dynamics is governed by Li\'enard
systems. On the other hand when $p=(n-2)/2$ the generic future attractor
consists of new solutions previously unknown in the literature which can drive
future acceleration whereas the case $p<(n-2)/2$ has a generic future attractor
de-Sitter solution. For $p=n/2$ the future asymptotics can be either fluid
dominated or have an oscillatory behaviour where neither the fluid nor the
scalar field dominates. For $p>n/2$ the future asymptotics is similar to the
case with no interaction. Finally, we show that irrespective of the parameters,
an inflationary quasi-de-Sitter solution always exists towards the past, and
therefore the cases with $p\leq(n-2)/2$ may provide new cosmological models of

the coherence of the extended Hamiltonian formalism against what they take to

of the electrostatic potential. Hence the bulk of the paper is best interpreted
as arguing that the longstanding claim about separate first-class constraints
is _either false or trivial_ -- de-Ockhamization (using more when less suffices
by splitting one quantity into the sum of two) being trivial. Unfortunately
section 9 of Pitts 2014, a primarily verbal argument that plays no role in
other works, is refuted.
  Pooley and Wallace's inverse Legendre transformation to de-Ockhamized
electromagnetism with an additively redefined electrostatic potential, however,
opens the door to a precisely analogous calculation introducing a photon mass,
which shows that a _second-class primary_ constraint generates a gauge
transformation in the exactly same sense -- a reductio ad absurdum of the claim
that a first-class constraint generates a gauge transformation and a
second-class constraint does not. Gauge freedom by de-Ockhamization does not
require any constraints at all, first-class or second-class, because any
dynamical variable in any Lagrangian can be de-Ockhamized into exhibiting
trivial additive artificial gauge freedom by splitting one quantity into the

lower for electronics, clothes, shoes, and Tobacco on darknet markets. Also,
darknet market counterfeits seem to have similar shipping origins as seized
goods, with some exceptions, such as a relatively high share (5%) of dark
market counterfeits originating from the US. Lastly, counterfeits on dark
markets tend to have a relatively low price and sales volume. However, based on
preliminary estimations, the original products on the surface web seem to be
worth a multiple of the prices of the counterfeit counterparts on darknet
markets. Gathering insights about counterfeits from darknet markets can be
valuable for businesses and authorities and be cost-effective compared to
border seizures. Thus, monitoring darknet markets can help us understand the
counterfeit landscape better.

this issue, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based TS scheme
assisted by initial path acquisition in this paper. Specifically, the classic
cross-correlation method is first employed to estimate a coarse timing offset
and capture an initial path, which shrinks the TS search region. Then, a
one-dimensional (1-D) CNN is developed to optimize the TS of OFDM systems. Due
to the narrowed search region of TS, the CNN-based TS effectively locates the
accurate TS point and inspires us to construct a lightweight network in terms
of computational complexity and online running time. Compared with the
compressed sensing-based TS method and extreme learning machine-based TS
method, simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively
improve the TS performance with the reduced computational complexity and online
running time. Besides, the proposed TS method presents robustness against the
variant parameters of multi-path fading channels.

susceptible to systematic modelling errors that depend on the adopted dark

Local Group galaxies on the SMHM relationship using the same technique,
extending it to M$_* \sim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ and suggest that some of these

the form of a central black hole, the black hole masses are in the range of
intermediate mass black holes, $10^{(5.7\pm0.6)}$ M$_\odot$, which corresponds
to masses of a few percent of M$_h$, well above values extrapolated from the

possible presence of an extra eV scale sterile neutrino. The addition of such a
neutrino will significantly impact the standard three flavour neutrino
oscillations; in particular, it can give rise to additional degeneracies due to
new sterile parameters. In our work, we investigate how the sensitivity to
determine the octant of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is affected by
introducing a sterile neutrino to the standard neutrino oscillation framework.
We compute the oscillation probabilities in presence of a sterile neutrino,
analytically, using the approximation that $\Delta_{21}$, the smallest mass
squared difference, is zero. We use these probabilities to understand the
degeneracies analytically at different baselines. We present our results of the
sensitivity to octant of $\theta_{23}$ for beam neutrinos using a liquid argon
time projection chamber (LArTPC). We also obtain octant sensitivity using
atmospheric neutrinos using the same LArTPC detector without any charge
identification capability. In addition, we include the charge tagging
capability of muon capture in argon which allows one to differentiate between
muon neutrino and antineutrino events. The combined sensitivity of beam and
atmospheric neutrinos in a similar experimental setup is also delineated. We
observe that by combining simulated data from the beam and atmospheric
neutrinos (including charge-id for muons), the sensitivity to the octant of
$\theta_{23}$ for true values of $\theta_{23}=41^\circ(49^\circ)$ exceeds
$4\sigma(3\sigma)$ for more than $50\%$ values of true $\delta_{13}$.

results reveal that the diversity of levels generated by EDRL is limited due to
the state space closure, whereas their quality does not deteriorate in a

($1.45\,\rm Ms$ duration) is to characterise the various manifestations of
winds in the X-rays driven from supermassive black holes in AGN. In this paper
we focus on the search and characterization of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs),
which are typically detected through blueshifted absorption troughs in the
Fe\,K band ($E>7\,\rm keV$). By following Monte Carlo procedures, we confirm
the detection of absorption lines corresponding to highly ionised iron (e.g.,
Fe\,\textsc{xxv}\,H$\alpha$, Fe\,\textsc{xxvi}\,Ly$\alpha$) in 7/22 sources at
the $\gtrsim95\%$ confidence level (for each individual line). The global
combined probability of such absorption features in the sample is $>99.9\%$.
The SUBWAYS campaign extends at higher luminosity and redshifts than previous
local studies on Seyferts, obtained using \xmm and \suzaku observations. We
find a UFO detection fraction of $\sim30\%$ on the total sample that is in
agreement with the previous findings. This work independently provides further
support for the existence of highly-ionised matter propagating at mildly
relativistic speed ($\gtrsim0.1c$) in a considerable fraction of AGN over a
broad range of luminosities, which is expected to play a key role in the
self-regulated AGN feeding-feedback cycle, as also supported by hydrodynamical

Our targets, spanning redshifts of 0.1-0.4 and bolometric luminosities (L_bol)
of 10^45-10^46 erg/s, have been observed with a large multi-wavelength
campaign. Here, we model the UV spectra and look for different types of AGN
outflows. We find that 60% of our targets show a presence of outflowing H I
absorption, while 40% exhibit ionized outflows seen as absorption by either C
IV, N V, or O VI. This is comparable to the occurrence of ionized outflows seen
in the local Seyfert galaxies. All UV absorption lines in the sample are
relatively narrow, with outflow velocities reaching up to -3300 km/s. We did
not detect any UV counterparts to the X-ray ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), most
likely due to their being too highly ionized. However, all SUBWAYS targets with
an X-ray UFO demonstrate the presence of UV outflows at lower velocities. We
find significant correlations between the column density (N) of the UV ions and
L_bol of the AGN, with N of H I decreasing with L_bol, while N of O VI is
increasing with L_bol. This is likely to be a photoionization effect, where
toward higher AGN luminosities, the wind becomes more ionized, resulting in
less absorption by neutral or low-ionization ions and more absorption by
high-ionization ions. In addition, we find that N of the UV ions decreases as
their outflow velocity increases. This may be explained by a mechanical power
that is evacuating the UV-absorbing medium. Our observed relations are
consistent with multiphase AGN feeding and feedback simulations indicating that
a combination of both radiative and mechanical processes are in play.

resources for decent effect. To achieve high-quality results with low
computational cost, we present a novel pixel spread model (PSM) that
iteratively employs decoupled probabilistic modeling, combining the
optimization efficiency of GANs with the prediction tractability of
probabilistic models. As a result, our model selectively spreads informative
pixels throughout the image in a few iterations, largely enhancing the
completion quality and efficiency. On multiple benchmarks, we achieve new

(0.985) for the KBC model with r=1 and optimization of (Ks, p, q). This result
was almost equivalent (0.973) to the DVC model with q=1 and optimization of

approach to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR). We propose a dedicated neural

to the RIS property of product and direct channel and homogeneous RIS antennas.
The architecture is scalable due to the fact that the number of trainable

share the same parameters). The weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE)
precoding is applied and an alternating optimization (AO) training procedure is

normally work by selecting a small range of incident wave-vector values,
focusing the incident light beam to a small spot, and recording the reflected
intensity at that angular range by means of photodetectors. This generally
provides signals proportional to a mixture of magnetization components,
requiring additional methodologies for full vectorial magnetic

  Here, we computationally investigate a Fourier-space MOKE setup, where a
focused beam ellipsometer using high numerical aperture optics and a camera
detector is employed to simultaneously map the intensity distribution for a
wide range of incident and reflected wave-vectors. We employ circularly
incident polarized light and no analyzing optics, in combination with a fitting

are derived from a global model, which is trained in a distributed fashion via
meta-gradient updates that account for subgroup heterogeneity while preserving
modeling commonalities that exist across the full dataset. To evaluate our
methodology, we consider case studies of two popular downstream student
modeling tasks, knowledge tracing and outcome prediction, which leverage
multiple modalities of student behavior (e.g., visits to lecture videos and
participation on forums) in model training. Experiments on three real-world
datasets from online courses demonstrate that our approach obtains substantial
improvements over existing student modeling baselines in terms of increasing
the average and decreasing the variance of prediction quality across different
student subgroups. Visual analysis of the resulting students' knowledge state
embeddings confirm that our personalization methodology extracts activity
patterns which cluster into different student subgroups, consistent with the
performance enhancements we obtain over the baselines.

classification, second-order phase transitions occur there. For RN-AdS black
hole, the Davies points can be classified into two types. The first type
corresponds to the extreme values of temperature and the second type

Employing the generalized Ehrenfest classification, we find that the orders of

method to determine from the rotation curve the model free parameters, namely,
the characteristic (central) density, scale radius, and consequently the total
mass. To do so, we perform Markov chain Monte Carlo statistical analyses based
on the Metropolis algorithm, maximizing our likelihoods adopting velocity and
radii data points of the rotation curves. We do not fit separately the
components for bulges, disk and halo, but we perform an overall fit including

to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) for cancer patients, examine
the generalizability of SODA to a new disease domain (i.e., opioid use), and
evaluate the extraction rate of SDoH using cancer populations.
  Methods: We identified SDoH categories and attributes and developed an SDoH
corpus using clinical notes from a general cancer cohort. We compared four
transformer-based NLP models to extract SDoH, examined the generalizability of
NLP models to a cohort of patients prescribed with opioids, and explored
customization strategies to improve performance. We applied the best NLP model
to extract 19 categories of SDoH from the breast (n=7,971), lung (n=11,804),
and colorectal cancer (n=6,240) cohorts.
  Results and Conclusion: We developed a corpus of 629 cancer patients notes
with annotations of 13,193 SDoH concepts/attributes from 19 categories of SDoH.
The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model
achieved the best strict/lenient F1 scores of 0.9216 and 0.9441 for SDoH
concept extraction, 0.9617 and 0.9626 for linking attributes to SDoH concepts.
Fine-tuning the NLP models using new annotations from opioid use patients
improved the strict/lenient F1 scores from 0.8172/0.8502 to 0.8312/0.8679. The
extraction rates among 19 categories of SDoH varied greatly, where 10 SDoH

class space telescope has been repeatedly proposed as a tool for exo-planet
detection and characterization, as well as for several topics at the forefront
of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics. Aim. This paper investigates the
potential benefits of an instrument concept based on an annular field of view,
as compared to a traditional focal plane imaging a contiguous area close to the
telescope optical axis. Method. Basic aspects of relative astrometry are
reviewed as a function of the distribution on the sky of reference stars
brighter than G = 12 mag (from Gaia EDR3). Statistics of field stars for
targets down to G = 8 mag is evaluated by analysis and simulation. Results.
Observation efficiency benefits from prior knowledge on individual targets,
since source model is improved with few measurements. Dedicated observations
(10-20 hours) can constrain the orbital inclination of exoplanets to a few
degrees. Observing strategy can be tailored to include a sample of stars,
materialising the reference frame, sufficiently large to average down the
residual catalogue errors to the desired microarcsec level. For most targets,
the annular field provides typically more reference stars, by a factor four to
seven in our case, than the conventional field. The brightest reference stars
for each target are up to 2 mag brighter. Conclusions. The proposed annular
field telescope concept improves on observation flexibility and/or astrometric
performance with respect to conventional designs. It appears therefore as an
appealing contribution to optimization of future relative astrometry missions.

semimetals, Bi and antimony (Sb). As Bi and Sb work functions energetically
aligns well with the TMDC conduction band edge, Ohmic or nearly-Ohmic $n$-type
contacts are prevalent. The interlayer distance of semimetal/TMDC contacts are
significantly larger than that of the metal/TMDC counterparts, which results in
only weak metalization of TMDC upon contact formation. Intriguingly, such weak
metalization generates semimetal-induced gap states (MIGS) that extends below
the conduction band minimum, thus offering an effective mechanism to reduce or
eliminate the $n$-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) while still preserving the
electronic structures of 2D TMDC. A modified Schottky-Mott rule that takes into
account SMIGS, interface dipole potential, and Fermi level shifting is
proposed, which provides an improved agreement with the DFT-simulated SBH. We
further show that the tunneling-specific resistivity of Sb/TMDC contacts are
generally lower than the Bi counterparts, thus indicating a better charge
injection efficiency can be achieved through Sb contacts. Our findings reveal
the promising potential of Bi and Sb as excellent companion electrode materials
for advancing 2D semiconductor device technology.

quantum eigensolver (VQE) has attracted much attentions as a possible
application of near-term quantum computers. Although the VQE has often been
applied to quantum chemistry, high computational cost is required for reliable
results because infinitely many measurements are needed to obtain an accurate
expectation value and the expectation value is calculated many times to
minimize a cost function in the variational optimization procedure. Therefore,
it is necessary to reduce the computational cost of the VQE for a practical
task such as estimating the potential energy surfaces (PESs) with chemical
accuracy, which is of particular importance for the analysis of molecular
structures and chemical reaction dynamics. A hybrid quantum-classical neural
network has recently been proposed for surrogate modeling of the VQE [Xia $et\
al$, Entropy 22, 828 (2020)]. Using the model, the ground state energies of a
simple molecule such as H2 can be inferred accurately without the variational
optimization procedure. In this study, we have extended the model by using the
subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver procedure so that the PESs of
the both ground and excited state can be inferred with chemical accuracy. We
also demonstrate the effects of sampling noise on performance of the
pre-trained model by using IBM's QASM backend.

$\text{div}$ satisfies a property we call inclusion-uniformity its spectrum
converges to a universal limiting distribution only depending on the dimension
of $K$. This class of subdivisions contains important special cases such as the
edgewise subdivision $\text{esd}_r$ for $r\geq 2$ and dimension $d=2$ or the

Welker showing that the roots of $f$-polynomials of iterated barycentric
subdivisions converge to a universal set of roots only depending on the

  Furthermore we determine the family of universal limiting functions for the
particular subdivision where the top dimensional faces are replaced by a cone
over their boundary. We will show that this choice of $\text{div}$ is the
natural generalization of graph subdivision in the spectral sense. These limits
are obtained by explicit spectral decimation of the sequence of its dual graphs

will give a construction of a self-similar sequence of graphs which dualizes
the iterated application of subdivision.

requires observations that probe the circumplanetary environment of accreting
giant planets. The mid-infrared ELT imager and spectrograph (METIS) will
provide a unique capability to detect warm-gas emission lines from
circumplanetary disks. Aims: We aim to demonstrate the capability of the METIS
instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) to detect circumplanetary
disks (CPDs) with fundamental v=1-0 transitions of $^{12}$CO from 4.5-5 $\mu$m.
Methods: We consider the case of the well-studied HD 100546 pre-transitional
disk to inform our disk modeling approach. We use the radiation-thermochemical
disk modeling code ProDiMo to produce synthetic spectral channel maps. The
observational simulator SimMETIS is employed to produce realistic data products
with the integral field spectroscopic (IFU) mode. Results: The detectability of
the CPD depends strongly on the level of external irradiation and the physical
extent of the disk, favoring massive (~10 M$_{\rm J}$) planets and spatially
extended disks with radii approaching the planetary Hill radius. The majority
of $^{12}$CO line emission originates from the outer disk surface, and thus the
CO line profiles are centrally peaked. The planetary luminosity does not
contribute significantly to exciting disk gas line emission. If CPDs are
dust-depleted, the $^{12}$CO line emission is enhanced as external radiation
can penetrate deeper into the line emitting region. Conclusions: UV-bright star
systems with pre-transitional disks are ideal candidates to search for
CO-emitting CPDs with ELT/METIS. METIS will be able to detect a variety of
circumplanetary disks via their fundamental $^{12}$CO ro-vibrational line
emission in only 60 s of total detector integration time.

coarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to
eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can

relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially
depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the

models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over
locally translation-invariant states of $n\gtrsim 100$ spins. Beyond this

Estimation (MPE) remains a challenging but necessary component of almost all
AMT approaches, even if only implicitly. In the context of AMT, pitch
information is typically quantized to the nominal pitches of the Western music
scale. Even in more general contexts, MPE systems typically produce pitch
predictions with some degree of quantization. In certain applications of AMT,
such as Guitar Tablature Transcription (GTT), it is more meaningful to estimate
continuous-valued pitch contours. Guitar tablature has the capacity to
represent various playing techniques, some of which involve pitch modulation.
Contemporary approaches to AMT do not adequately address pitch modulation, and
offer only less quantization at the expense of more model complexity. In this

contours, grouping them according to their string and fret of origin. We
demonstrate that for this task, the proposed method significantly improves the
resolution of MPE and simultaneously yields tablature estimation results

by random planar maps, which realizes a lattice discretization of the path

analyze their exploration via the peeling process. The aforementioned trees
provide the basis for the construction of the universal continuum limit of the

team. Moreover, it is not always clear the relationship between the role of an
agent and his personal attributes. In this work we conceive an application of
the Shapley analysis for studying the contribution of both agent policies and
attributes, putting them on equal footing. Since the computational complexity
is NP-hard and scales exponentially with the number of participants in a
transferable utility coalitional game, we resort to exploiting a-priori
knowledge about the rules of the game to constrain the relations between the
participants over a graph. We hence propose a method to determine a
Hierarchical Knowledge Graph of agents' policies and features in a Multi-Agent
System. Assuming a simulator of the system is available, the graph structure
allows to exploit dynamic programming to assess the importances in a much
faster way. We test the proposed approach in a proof-of-case environment
deploying both hardcoded policies and policies obtained via Deep Reinforcement
Learning. The proposed paradigm is less computationally demanding than
trivially computing the Shapley values and provides great insight not only into
the importance of an agent in a team but also into the attributes needed to
deploy the policy at its best.

proposed, which switches GFM-VSC between fast and slow IVS dynamics based on
system needs. The proposed method enhances the transient stability of GFM-VSC,
whilst maximizing its capability of providing GFM service. Further, the
approach is robust to different grid strengths and different types of grid

waves, which propagate, shock and deposit angular momentum in the disc. This
results in gap opening around the planetary orbit, even for low (sub-thermal)
mass planets, provided that the effective viscosity in the disc is low. The
edges of these planet-induced gaps are known to be prone to emergence of
observable vortices via the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). We study timescales
for the development of vortices driven by low mass planets in inviscid discs.
We employ a recently developed semi-analytical theory of vortensity production
by the planet-driven shock to predict vortensity evolution near the planet,
from which we derive the radial profile of the planet-induced gap as a function
of time (this procedure can have multiple other uses, e.g. to study dust
trapping, suppression of pebble accretion, etc.). We then analyze the linear
stability of the gap edges against the RWI, obtaining the timescales for the
first appearance of unstable modes and (later) fully developed vortices at gap
edges. We present useful formulae for these timescales as functions of
planetary and disc parameters and provide their physical justification. We also
thoroughly test our semi-analytical framework against high resolution 2D
hydrodynamic simulations, confirming the accuracy of our theoretical
predictions. We discuss ways in which our semi-analytical framework can be
extended to incorporate additional physics, e.g. planetary accretion,
migration, and non-zero disc viscosity. Our results can be used to interpret
observations of PPDs and to predict emergence of vortices in simulations.

However, current image classification models often perform poorly in the OOD
setting due to statistically spurious correlations learning from model
training. From causality-based perspective, we formulate the data generation
process in OOD image classification using a causal graph. On this graph, we
show that prediction P(Y|X) of a label Y given an image X in statistical
learning is formed by both causal effect P(Y|do(X)) and spurious effects caused
by confounding features (e.g., background). Since the spurious features are
domain-variant, the prediction P(Y|X) becomes unstable on unseen domains. In
this paper, we propose to mitigate the spurious effect of confounders using
front-door adjustment. In our method, the mediator variable is hypothesized as
semantic features that are essential to determine a label for an image.
Inspired by capability of style transfer in image generation, we interpret the
combination of the mediator variable with different generated images in the
front-door formula and propose novel algorithms to estimate it. Extensive
experimental results on widely used benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness

genome, is a fundamental source of genomic information: its collection is the
first step in strategic computational methods ranging from assembly to sequence
comparison and phylogeny. Unfortunately, it is costly to store. This motivates
some recent studies regarding the compression of those k-mer sets. However,
such an area does not have the maturity of genomic compression, lacking an
homogeneous and methodologically sound experimental foundation that allows to
fairly compare the relative merits of the available solutions, and that takes
into account also the rich choices of compression methods that can be used.
  Results: We provide such a foundation here, supporting it with an extensive
set of experiments that use reference datasets and a carefully selected set of
representative data compressors. Our results highlight the spectrum of
compressor choices one has in terms of Pareto Optimality of compression vs.
post-processing, this latter being important when the Dictionary needs to be
decompressed many times. In addition to the useful indications, not available
elsewhere, that this study offers to the researchers interested in storing
k-mer dictionaries in compressed form, a software system that can be readily
used to explore the Pareto Optimal solutions available r a given Dictionary is
also provided.

information to classify multiple moving targets. In particular, we address the
challenge of computing control inputs that move the drone to informative

typically lack of analytical relationships between the viewpoints and their
associated outputs, preventing their use in information-gathering schemes. To
fill this gap, we propose a novel attention-based architecture, trained via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), that outputs the next viewpoint for the drone
favoring the acquisition of evidence from as many unclassified targets as
possible while reasoning about their movement, orientation, and occlusions.
Then, we use a low-level MPC controller to move the drone to the desired
viewpoint taking into account its actual dynamics. We show that our approach
not only outperforms a variety of baselines but also generalizes to scenarios
unseen during training. Additionally, we show that the network scales to large
numbers of targets and generalizes well to different movement dynamics of the
targets.

considerable progress in this area in the past years, measuring and comparing
the effectiveness of fuzzers is still an open research question. In software
testing, the gold standard for evaluating test quality is mutation analysis,
assessing the ability of a test to detect synthetic bugs; if a set of tests
fails to detect such mutations, it will also fail to detect real bugs. Mutation
analysis subsumes various coverage measures and provides a large and diverse
set of faults that can be arbitrarily hard to trigger and detect, thus
preventing the problems of saturation and overfitting. Unfortunately, the cost
of traditional mutation analysis is exorbitant for fuzzing, as mutations need
independent evaluation.
  In this paper, we apply modern mutation analysis techniques that pool
multiple mutations; allowing us, for the first time, to evaluate and compare
fuzzers with mutation analysis. We introduce an evaluation bench for fuzzers
and apply it to a number of popular fuzzers and subjects. In a comprehensive
evaluation, we show how it allows us to assess fuzzer performance and measure
the impact of improved techniques. While we find that today's fuzzers can
detect only a small percentage of mutations, this should be seen as a challenge
for future research -- notably in improving (1) detecting failures beyond
generic crashes (2) triggering mutations (and thus faults).

definition (of dataset O in terms of datasets I) is a logical specification
involving the source data I and the interface data O. It is a valid definition
of O in terms of I, if any two models of the specification agreeing on I agree
on O. In contrast, an explicit definition is a query that produces O from I.
Variants of Beth's theorem state that one can convert implicit definitions to
explicit ones. Further, this conversion can be done effectively given a proof
witnessing implicit definability in a suitable proof system.
  We prove the analogous implicit-to-explicit result for nested relations:
implicit definitions, given in the natural logic for nested relations, can be
converted to explicit definitions in the nested relational calculus (NRC) We
first provide a model-theoretic argument for this result, which makes some
additional connections that may be of independent interest. between NRC
queries, interpretations, a standard mechanisms for defining
structure-to-structure translation in logic, and between interpretations and
implicit to definability ""up to unique isomorphism"". The latter connection
makes use of a variation of a result of Gaifman concerning ""relatively
categorical"" theories.
  We also provide a proof-theoretic result that provides an effective argument:
from a proof witnessing implicit definability, we can efficiently produce an
NRC definition. This will involve introducing the appropriate proof system for
reasoning with nested sets, along with some auxiliary Beth-type results for
this system. As a consequence, we can effectively extract rewritings of NRC
queries in terms of NRC views, given a proof witnessing that the query is
determined by the views.

environments by training in simulation with a diverse ''population'' of
environments (i.e. domain randomization). In this work, we focus on enabling
generalization in assistive tasks: tasks in which the robot is acting to assist
a user (e.g. helping someone with motor impairments with bathing or with
scratching an itch). Such tasks are particularly interesting relative to prior
sim2real successes because the environment now contains a human who is also
acting. This complicates the problem because the diversity of human users
(instead of merely physical environment parameters) is more difficult to
capture in a population, thus increasing the likelihood of encountering
out-of-distribution (OOD) human policies at test time. We advocate that
generalization to such OOD policies benefits from (1) learning a good latent
representation for human policies that test-time humans can accurately be
mapped to, and (2) making that representation adaptable with test-time
interaction data, instead of relying on it to perfectly capture the space of
human policies based on the simulated population only. We study how to best
learn such a representation by evaluating on purposefully constructed OOD test
policies. We find that sim2real methods that encode environment (or population)
parameters and work well in tasks that robots do in isolation, do not work well
in assistance. In assistance, it seems crucial to train the representation
based on the history of interaction directly, because that is what the robot
will have access to at test time. Further, training these representations to
then predict human actions not only gives them better structure, but also
enables them to be fine-tuned at test-time, when the robot observes the partner
act. https://adaptive-caregiver.github.io.

Existing work addresses this issue by training a subset of parameters or adding
model patches. Developed with inference in mind, Inverted Residual Blocks
(IRBs) split a convolutional layer into depthwise and pointwise convolutions,
leading to more stacking layers, e.g., convolution, normalization, and
activation layers. Though they are efficient for inference, IRBs require that
additional activation maps are stored in memory for training weights for
convolution layers and scales for normalization layers. As a result, their high
memory cost prohibits training IRBs on resource-limited edge devices, and
making them unsuitable in the context of transfer learning. To address this
issue, we present MobileTL, a memory and computationally efficient on-device
transfer learning method for models built with IRBs. MobileTL trains the shifts
for internal normalization layers to avoid storing activation maps for the
backward pass. Also, MobileTL approximates the backward computation of the
activation layer (e.g., Hard-Swish and ReLU6) as a signed function which
enables storing a binary mask instead of activation maps for the backward pass.
MobileTL fine-tunes a few top blocks (close to output) rather than propagating
the gradient through the whole network to reduce the computation cost. Our
method reduces memory usage by 46% and 53% for MobileNetV2 and V3 IRBs,
respectively. For MobileNetV3, we observe a 36% reduction in floating-point
operations (FLOPs) when fine-tuning 5 blocks, while only incurring a 0.6%
accuracy reduction on CIFAR10. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method is Pareto-optimal (best accuracy under given
hardware constraints) compared to prior work in transfer learning for edge
devices.

properties of a single layer WS$_{1.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ alloys. The electronic
structure of this alloy, explored using angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, shows a clear valence band structure anisotropy characterized by
two paraboloids shifted in one direction of the k-space by a constant in-plane
vector. This band splitting is a signature of a unidirectional Rashba spin
splitting with a related giant Rashba parameter of 2.8 0.7 eV . The combination
of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy with piezo force microscopy
highlights the link between this giant unidirectional Rashba spin splitting and
an in-plane polarization present in the alloy. These peculiar anisotropic
properties of the WS$_{1.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ alloy can be related to local atomic
orders induced during the growth process due the different size and
electronegativity between S and Se atoms. This distorted crystal structure
combined to the observed macroscopic tensile strain, as evidenced by
photoluminescence, displays electric dipoles with a strong in-plane component,
as shown by piezoelectric microscopy. The interplay between semiconducting

However, these MOA* algorithms often suffer from high memory usage, especially

isotropy if there is a preferential energy flow direction. It also might forge
homogeneity if the outward (inward) flux is isotropic. Thus, any VSL model

very challenging both for the data volume and for the low signal to noise
ratio. Here we propose two complementary unsupervised machine learning methods
to support market surveillance aimed at identifying potential insider trading
activities. The first one uses clustering to identify, in the vicinity of a
price sensitive event such as a takeover bid, discontinuities in the trading
activity of an investor with respect to his/her own past trading history and on
the present trading activity of his/her peers. The second unsupervised approach
aims at identifying (small) groups of investors that act coherently around
price sensitive events, pointing to potential insider rings, i.e. a group of
synchronised traders displaying strong directional trading in rewarding
position in a period before the price sensitive event. As a case study, we
apply our methods to investor resolved data of Italian stocks around takeover
bids.

  constant solid angle",,,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surface geometry plays a central role in the design of bridges, vaults and
shells, using various techniques for generating a geometry which aims to
balance structural, spatial, aesthetic and construction requirements.
  In this paper we propose the use of surfaces defined such that given closed
curves subtend a constant solid angle at all points on the surface and form its
boundary. Constant solid angle surfaces enable one to control the boundary
slope and hence achieve an approximately constant span-to-height ratio as the
span varies, making them structurally viable for shell structures. In addition,
when the entire surface boundary is in the same plane, the slope of the surface
around the boundary is constant and thus follows a principal curvature
direction. Such surfaces are suitable for surface grids where planar
quadrilaterals meet the surface boundaries. They can also be used as the Airy
stress function in the form finding of shells having forces concentrated at the
corners.
  Our technique employs the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to calculate the solid angle
of a point in space and Newton's method to move the point onto the constant
solid angle surface. We use the Biot-Savart law to find the gradient of the
solid angle. The technique can be applied in parallel to each surface point
without an initial mesh, opening up for future studies and other applications
when boundary curves are known but the initial topology is unknown.
  We show the geometrical properties, possibilities and limitations of surfaces
of constant solid angle using examples in three dimensions.

time horizon based on the decision of the previous time horizon, and determine
the current time horizon based on the principle of larger non-switching latency
tolerance. If the service is not reallocated, the decision for the current time
slot remains the same as the decision for the previous time slot; if the
service is reallocated, the non-reach time of the current time slot is
minimized and the service allocation and base station selection decision for
the current time slot is obtained; the service allocation and base station

Bayesian Personalized Ranking and power law distribution. We show that our

  rights reserved",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computational discovery of ideal lead compounds is a critical process for
modern drug discovery. It comprises multiple stages: hit screening, molecular
property prediction, and molecule optimization. Current efforts are disparate,
involving the establishment of models for each stage, followed by multi-stage
multi-model integration. However, this is non-ideal, as clumsy integration of
incompatible models increases research overheads, and may even reduce success
rates in drug discovery. Facilitating compatibilities requires establishing
inherent model consistencies across lead discovery stages. Towards that effect,
we propose an open deep graph learning (DGL) based pipeline: generative
adversarial feature subspace enhancement (GAFSE), which first unifies the
modeling of these stages into one learning framework. GAFSE also offers
standardized modular design and streamlined interfaces for future expansions
and community support. GAFSE combines adversarial/generative learning, graph
attention network, graph reconstruction network, and optimizes the
classification/regression loss, adversarial/generative loss, and reconstruction
loss simultaneously. Convergence analysis theoretically guarantees model
generalization performance. Exhaustive benchmarking demonstrates that the GAFSE
pipeline achieves excellent performance across almost all lead discovery
stages, while also providing valuable model interpretability. Hence, we believe
this tool will enhance the efficiency and productivity of drug discovery
researchers.

method [2, 3]. This new electrophoresis method significantly reduces the
processing time to about 40 minutes, as opposed to the 2-D PAGE method which
can take one or two days. Special methods to spot samples on hydrophobic blot
membranes were established for successful separation of protein and protein
complexes. These spotting methods are used in conjunction with the patented
electrophoresis method [1] for effective separation. The automated device
effectively replicates these special methods that are repeatable and user

separate protein complexes in addition to single proteins under non-denaturing
conditions, thus eliminating the variability of the manual spotting method.

cardinals proposed by Cantor, a recently introduced methodology using \G1-based
infinite numbers is applied to measure the set $A$ (where the number \G1 is
called \emph{grossone}). Our interest to this methodology is explained by the
fact that in certain cases where cardinals allow one to say only whether a set
is countable or it has the cardinality of the continuum, the \G1-based
methodology can provide a more accurate measurement of infinite sets. In this
article, lower and upper estimates of the number of elements of $A$ are
obtained. Both estimates are expressed in \G1-based numbers.
