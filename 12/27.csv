survive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and
beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a
specific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although
BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and
engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the
method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence
(AI) for a data-driven approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a
generative design approach based on the generative pre-trained language model
(PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in
the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer,
namely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators
are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the
problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess
the mapping relevancy between the domains within the generated BID concepts.
The approach is evaluated and then employed in a real-world project of
designing light-weighted flying cars during its conceptual design phase The
results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.

graph-structured data across numerous domains. Their underlying ability to
represent nodes as summaries of their vicinities has proven effective for
homophilous graphs in particular, in which same-type nodes tend to connect. On
heterophilous graphs, in which different-type nodes are likely connected, GNNs
perform less consistently, as neighborhood information might be less
representative or even misleading. On the other hand, GNN performance is not
inferior on all heterophilous graphs, and there is a lack of understanding of
what other graph properties affect GNN performance.
  In this work, we highlight the limitations of the widely used homophily ratio
and the recent Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity (CCNS) metric in estimating
GNN performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce 2-hop Neighbor
Class Similarity (2NCS), a new quantitative graph structural property that
correlates with GNN performance more strongly and consistently than alternative

The alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a
high-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor
terminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The
high-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is
around 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In
the proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise
and fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when
pulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances
can be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves. As a result, the
leakage currents passing through the ball bearing and overvoltage stress on the

Quantum Mechanics by extending the usual Hilbert space. The time parameter $t$
and the position operator $\hat{X}$ in one subspace, and the position parameter
$x$ and time operator $\mathbb{T}$ in the other subspace. Time as an operator
is better suitable for describing tunnelling processes. We then solve the novel
$1/2$-fractional integrodifferential equation for a particle subjected to
strong and weak potential limits and obtain an analytical expression for the
tunnelling time through a rectangular barrier. We compare to previous works,
obtaining pure imaginary times for energies below the barrier and a
fast-decaying imaginary part for energies above the barrier, indicating the
anti-hermiticity of the time operator for tunnelling times. We also show that
the expected time of arrival in the tunnelling problem has the form of an
energy average of the classical times of arrival plus a quantum contribution.

width is determined by the collisional and radiative losses. In high mobility
samples, the latter may dominate even when the resonant frequencies can be
described by a standard quasistatic approximation, i.e., neglecting
electromagnetic retardation. Placing a metal near the disk drastically affects
the radiative broadening of the line width due to the interference of
electromagnetic fields created by the disk and the metal charges. Bringing the
disk in close proximity to the gate makes the total field almost vanish. In
that case, the line width is defined solely by the collisional broadening. As
the disk is moved away from the gate, the line width first shows a reduction
since the plasmon transforms into plasmon-polariton, which is dressed with
undamped electromagnetic field surrounding the disk. Then it increases and
exhibits decaying oscillations, reaching the asymptotic value of the ungated
disk.

obtained depends on the coherences that the state develops during the process,
the characteristics of the meter used to measure the energy, and the noise it
induces into the system. We analyze those contributions in some detail to
unveil their role. We show that in very particular cases, but not in general,
the effect of such noise gives a factor multiplying the result that would be
obtained if projective measurements were used instead of non-projective ones.
The unsharp character of the measurements used to monitor the energy of the

of interest. In particular, if the distance between neighboring elements in the
energy spectrum is much larger than the resolution of the meter, then a similar
result to the projective measurement case is obtained, up to a multiplicative
factor that depends on the meter. A more subtle situation arises in the
opposite case in which measurements may be non-informative, i.e. they may not
contribute to update the information about the system. In this case, a
correction to the relation obtained in the non-overlapping case appears. We
analyze the conditions in which such a correction becomes negligible. We also
study the coherences, in terms of the relative entropy of coherence developed

differential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous way to bound that leakage under a

in workloads of multiple ML models training on user data. Once it is used, the
DP budget is forever consumed. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate it most
efficiently to train as many models as possible. This paper presents the
scheduler for privacy that optimizes for efficiency. We formulate privacy
scheduling as a new type of multidimensional knapsack problem, called privacy
knapsack, which maximizes DP budget efficiency. We show that privacy knapsack
is NP-hard, hence practical algorithms are necessarily approximate. We develop
an approximation algorithm for privacy knapsack, DPK, and evaluate it on
microbenchmarks and on a new, synthetic private-ML workload we developed from
the Alibaba ML cluster trace. We show that DPK: (1) often approaches the
efficiency-optimal schedule, (2) consistently schedules more tasks compared to
a state-of-the-art privacy scheduling algorithm that focused on fairness
(1.3-1.7x in Alibaba, 1.0-2.6x in microbenchmarks), but (3) sacrifices some
level of fairness for efficiency. Therefore, using DPK, DP ML operators should
be able to train more models on the same amount of user data while offering the
same privacy guarantee to their users.

width penalises the composition operation along ``big'' objects, while it
encourages the use of monoidal products. We show that, by choosing the correct

for tracing magnetic nanoparticles. A common imaging procedure calibrates a
system matrix (SM) that is used to reconstruct data from subsequent scans. The
ill-posed reconstruction problem can be solved by simultaneously enforcing data
consistency based on the SM and regularizing the solution based on an image
prior. Traditional hand-crafted priors cannot capture the complex attributes of
MPI images, whereas recent MPI methods based on learned priors can suffer from
extensive inference times or limited generalization performance. Here, we
introduce a novel physics-driven method for MPI reconstruction based on a deep
equilibrium model with learned data consistency (DEQ-MPI). DEQ-MPI reconstructs
images by augmenting neural networks into an iterative optimization, as
inspired by unrolling methods in deep learning. Yet, conventional unrolling
methods are computationally restricted to few iterations resulting in
non-convergent solutions, and they use hand-crafted consistency measures that
can yield suboptimal capture of the data distribution. DEQ-MPI instead trains
an implicit mapping to maximize the quality of a convergent solution, and it
incorporates a learned consistency measure to better account for the data
distribution. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental data indicate that
DEQ-MPI achieves superior image quality and competitive inference time to
state-of-the-art MPI reconstruction methods.

equation from the classified family of fourth order Lagrange equations is
singled out. Travelling wave solutions of the latter are found through a
similarity reduction by variational symmetry operators, followed by a double
order reduction into a second order ordinary differential equation.
Multi-soliton solutions and other exact solutions are also found by various

dimensional filtering problems, it has a robustness that is not shared for

collapse. However, there is no theory which quantifies its accuracy as an

the ensemble Kalman filter beyond the Gaussian setting. Our analysis is
developed for the mean field ensemble Kalman filter. We rewrite the update
equations for this filter, and for the true filtering distribution, in terms of
maps on probability measures. We introduce a weighted total variation metric to
estimate the distance between the two filters and we prove various stability
estimates for the maps defining the evolution of the two filters, in this
metric. Using these stability estimates we demonstrate that if the true
filtering distribution is close to Gaussian in the joint space of state and
data, in the weighted total variation metric, then the true-filter is well
approximated by the ensemble Kalman filter, in the same metric. Finally, we
provide a generalization of these results to the Gaussian projected filter,
which can be viewed as a mean field description of the unscented Kalman filter.

successful strategies against catastrophic forgetting. However, since
forgetting is inevitable given bounded memory and unbounded tasks, how to
forget is a problem continual learning must address. Therefore, beyond simply
avoiding catastrophic forgetting, an under-explored issue is how to reasonably
forget while ensuring the merits of human memory, including 1. storage
efficiency, 2. generalizability, and 3. some interpretability. To achieve these
simultaneously, our paper proposes a new saliency-augmented memory completion
framework for continual learning, inspired by recent discoveries in memory
completion separation in cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we innovatively
propose to store the part of the image most important to the tasks in episodic
memory by saliency map extraction and memory encoding. When learning new tasks,
previous data from memory are inpainted by an adaptive data generation module,
which is inspired by how humans complete episodic memory. The module's
parameters are shared across all tasks and it can be jointly trained with a
continual learning classifier as bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments on
several continual learning and image classification benchmarks demonstrate the
proposed method's effectiveness and efficiency.

magnetohydrodynamics. The classical field theories describing these systems
bear some resemblance to perhaps more familiar fluctuating membrane and
continuous spin models, but the fluid physics drives these models into
unconventional regimes exhibiting large scale jet and eddy structures. From a
dynamical point of view these structures are the end result of various
conserved variable forward and inverse cascades. The resulting balance between
large scale structure and small scale fluctuations is controlled by the
competition between energy and entropy in the system free energy, in turn
highly tunable through setting the values of the conserved integrals. Although

has a small explicit breaking. Although we cannot determine the full dynamics
of the system reliably, we provide evidence that such an ALP can account for
the observed dark matter abundance while having a relatively small decay
constant and consequently a possibly large coupling to photons. In particular,
we determine the number of domain walls per Hubble patch around the time when
they form using numerical simulations and combine this with analytic
expectations about the subsequent dynamics. We show that the strongest
constraint on the decay constant is likely to come from the dark matter ALPs
being produced with large isocurvature fluctuations at small spatial scales. We
also comment on the uncertainties on the dark matter small-scale structure that
might form from these overdensities, in particular pointing out the importance
of quantum pressure in the $N=1$ case.

the energy density of DR, but also whether it is interacting. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of five types of interacting DR (free-streaming,
fluid, decoupling, instantaneous decoupling, and recoupling DR) and their
impact on cosmological observables. We modify the Boltzmann hierarchy to
describe all these types of interacting DR under the relaxation time
approximation. We, for the first time, robustly calculate the collision terms
for recoupling scalar DR and provide a better estimation of the recoupling
transition redshift. We demonstrate the distinct features of each type of DR on
the CMB and matter power spectra. We perform MCMC scans using the Planck 2018
data and BAO data. Assuming no new physics in the SM neutrino sector, we find
no statistically significant constraints on the couplings of DR, although there
is a slight preference for a late transition redshift for instantaneous
decoupling DR around recombination, and for the fluid-like limit of all the
cases. The $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint varies marginally depending on the
type of DR.

from imaging surveys. We compare the conditional luminosity function (CLF) and
weak lensing halo masses between two different cluster samples at fixed
richness, detected within the same volume ($0.1{<}z{<}0.34$) using the
red-sequence and halo-based methods. After calibrating our CLF deprojection
method against mock galaxy samples, we measure the 3D CLFs by cross-correlating
clusters with SDSS photometric galaxies. As expected, the CLFs of red-sequence
and halo-based finders exhibit redder and bluer populations, respectively. The
red-sequence clusters have a flat distribution of red galaxies at the faint
end, while the halo-based clusters host a decreasing faint red and a boosted
blue population at the bright end. By comparing subsamples of clusters that
have a match between the two catalogues to those without matches, we discover
that the CLF shape is mainly caused by the different cluster centroiding.
However, the average weak lensing halo mass between the matched and non-matched
clusters are consistent with each other in either cluster sample for halos with
$\lambda>30$ (M$_{h}^{WL}{>}1.5\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$). Since the colour
preferences of the two cluster finders are almost orthogonal, such a
consistency indicates that the scatter in the mass-richness relation of either
cluster sample is close to random. Therefore, while the choice of how optical
clusters are identified impacts the satellite content, our result suggests that
it should not introduce strong systematic biases in cluster cosmology, except
for the $\lambda<30$ regime.

variable selection methods play indispensable roles in identifying the critical
features for scientific discoveries. Traditional best subset selection methods
are computationally intractable with a large number of features, while
regularization methods such as Lasso, SCAD and their variants perform poorly in
ultrahigh-dimensional data due to low computational efficiency and unstable
algorithm. Sure screening methods have become popular alternatives by first
rapidly reducing the dimension using simple measures such as marginal
correlation then applying any regularization methods. A number of screening
methods for different models or problems have been developed, however, none of

important characteristics of modern big data. In this paper, we propose a
robust distance correlation (``RDC'') based sure screening method to perform

proposed method shares the same good properties as the original model-free
distance correlation based screening while has additional merit of robustly
estimating the distance correlation when data is heavy-tailed and improves the
model selection performance in screening. We conducted extensive simulations

and scientific discoveries. Numerous regularization and Bayesian variable
selection methods have been developed in the past two decades for variable
selection, but they mainly target at only one response. As more data being
collected nowadays, it is common to obtain and analyze multiple correlated
responses from the same study. Running separate regression for each response
ignores their correlation thus multivariate analysis is recommended. Existing
multivariate methods select variables related to all responses without
considering the possible heterogeneous sparsity of different responses, i.e.
some features may only predict a subset of responses but not the rest. In this
paper, we develop a novel Bayesian indicator variable selection method in
multivariate regression model with a large number of grouped predictors
targeting at multiple correlated responses with possibly heterogeneous sparsity
patterns. The method is motivated by the multi-trait fine mapping problem in
genetics to identify the variants that are causal to multiple related traits.
Our new method is featured by its selection at individual level, group level as
well as specific to each response. In addition, we propose a new concept of
subset posterior inclusion probability for inference to prioritize predictors
that target at subset(s) of responses. Extensive simulations with varying
sparsity and heterogeneity levels and dimension have shown the advantage of our
method in variable selection and prediction performance as compared to existing
general Bayesian multivariate variable selection methods and Bayesian fine
mapping methods. We also applied our method to a real data example in imaging
genetics and identified important causal variants for brain white matter
structural change in different regions.

temperature gradients which lead to uneven thermal expansion and contraction,
and, consequently, distortion of the fabricated components. The distortion has
a great influence on the structural performance and dimensional accuracy, e.g.,
for assembly. It is therefore of critical importance to model, predict and,
ultimately, reduce distortion. In this paper, we present a computational
framework for fabrication sequence optimization to minimize distortion in
multi-axis additive manufacturing (e.g., robotic wire arc additive
manufacturing), in which the fabrication sequence is not limited to planar
layers only. We encode the fabrication sequence by a continuous pseudo-time
field, and optimize it using gradient-based numerical optimization. To
demonstrate this framework, we adopt a computationally tractable yet reasonably
accurate model to mimic the material shrinkage in metal additive manufacturing
and thus to predict the distortion of the fabricated components. Numerical

reply to their message, click on a URL that redirects them to a phishing

smishing attacks daily. Drawing inspiration by the works of Tu et al. (USENIX

Accordingly, we designed smishing experiments and sent phishing SMSes to 265
users to measure the efficacy of smishing attacks. We sent eight fake text
messages to participants and recorded their CLICK, REPLY, and CALL responses
along with their feedback in a post-test survey. Our results reveal that 16.92%

repeat phishing, we subjected a set of randomly selected participants to a
second round of smishing attacks with a different message than the one they
received in the first round. As a result, we observed that 12.82% potentially
fell for the attack again. Using logistic regression, we observed that a

prerequisites for accurately constructing complex multi-component quantum

semi-metallic $\mathrm{\alpha-Sn}$ or superconducting $\mathrm{\beta-Sn}$. For
InAs nanowires, we obtain phase-pure, superconducting $\mathrm{\beta-Sn}$

modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and weighted Wiener amalgam spaces
$W(\mathcal{F} L^p_{m_1},L^q_{m_2})(\mathbb{R}^d)$. All of the classical
time-frequency representations, such as the short-time Fourier transform
(STFT), the $\tau$-Wigner distributions and the ambiguity function, can be
written as metaplectic Wigner distributions $\mu(\mathcal{A})(f\otimes
\bar{g})$, where $\mu(\mathcal{A})$ is the metaplectic operator and
$\mathcal{A}$ is the associated symplectic matrix. Namely, time-frequency
representations can be represented as images of metaplectic operators, which
become the real protagonists of time-frequency analysis. In [E. Cordero and L.
Rodino (2022) ""Characterization of Modulation Spaces by symplectic
representations and applications to Schr\""odinger equations"",
arXiv:2204.14124], the authors suggest that any metaplectic Wigner distribution
that satisfies the so-called ""shift-invertibility"" condition can replace the
STFT in the definition of modulation spaces. In this work, we prove that
shift-invertibility alone is not sufficient, but it has to be complemented by
an upper-triangularity condition for this characterization to hold, whereas a
lower-triangularity property comes in to play for Wiener amalgam spaces. The
shift-invertibility property is necessary: Ryhaczek and and conjugate Ryhaczek
distributions are not shift-invertible and they fail the characterization of
the above spaces. We also exhibit examples of shift-invertible distributions
without upper-tryangularity condition which do not define modulation spaces.
Finally, we provide new families of time-frequency representations that
characterize modulation spaces, with the purpose of replacing the
time-frequency shifts with other atoms that allow to decompose signals
differently, with possible new outcomes in applications.

superconductivity. In these compounds, distinct CDW phases with wave-vectors at
the $M$ and $L$ points are energetically favorable, opening the possibility of
tuning the type of CDW order by appropriate external parameters. Here, we shed
light on the CDW landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ via a combination of
first-principles calculations and phenomenology, which consists of extracting
the coefficients of the CDW Landau free-energy expansion from density
functional theory. We find that while the main structural distortions of the
kagome lattice in the staggered tri-hexagonal CDW phase are along the
nearest-neighbor V-V bonds, distortions associated with the Sb ions play a
defining role in the energy gain in this and all other CDW states. Moreover,
the coupling between ionic displacements from different unit cells is small,
thus explaining the existence of multiple CDW instabilities with different
modulations along the c-axis. We also investigate how pressure and temperature
impact the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Increasing pressure does not change the
staggered tri-hexagonal CDW ground state, even though the $M$-point CDW
instability disappears before the $L$-point one, a behavior that we attribute
to the large nonlinear coupling between the order parameters. Upon changing the
temperature, we find a narrow regime in which another transition can take
place, toward a tri-hexagonal Star-of-David CDW phase. We discuss the
implications of our results by comparing them with experiments on this

incorporating the Fermi surface anisotropy together with an anisotropic spin

rescaled $H^{||}_{\rm c2}$ by the critical temperature at zero field occurs not
only due to the disorder effect but also to an anisotropic non-ideal Rashba
spin texture depending on the field direction. We also study the parity mixing

moderately clean regime because of the fragile $s$-wave pairing against
nonmagnetic scattering in the case of the dominant odd parity component of a
pair wavefunction. Furthermore, from the analysis of the transition line, we
identify the field resilience factor taking account of the scattering and
suppression of paramagnetic effects and discuss the origin of the field

PCD can simultaneously provide the photon energy measurement and enable

performance with lower noise and improved spatial resolution compared to

material decomposition approach with multiple energy bin measurements, PCCT
virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) have lower noise, and superior performance
in quantifying iodine and calcium concentrations. These improvements lead to
increased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for both high and low contrast study

Low temperature critical current density of these films above the optimum
doping were found to be high and were primarily determined by the hole

level of oxygen deficiency. This implies that oxygen disorder plays only a
secondary role and the intrinsic Jc0 is primarily governed by the carrier

training process, the ID conditional DDPM is trained to generate face images

facial expert models to make the model transfer source identity while
preserving target attributes faithfully. During this process, to preserve the

generated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function
which is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for
negative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the
goodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the
squared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in
time, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning
much simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the
network without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.

(i) verify the equality of their data, and (ii) whenever a discrepancy is found
afterwards, determine which of the two modified his data. The most common
example is where they want to authenticate messages they exchange. Another
possible example is where they have a huge database and its mirror in remote
places, and whenever a discrepancy is found between their data, they can
determine which of the two users is to blame. Of course, if one is allowed to
use computational assumptions, this function can be realized readily, e.g., by
using digital signatures. However, if one needs information-theoretic security,
there is no known method that realizes this function efficiently, i.e., with
secret key, communication, and trusted third parties all being sufficiently
small. In order to realize this function efficiently with information-theoretic
security, we here define the ``equality-testing protocol with dispute
resolution'' as a new framework. The most significant difference between our
protocol and the previous methods with similar functions is that we allow the
intervention of a trusted third party when checking the equality of the data.
In this new framework, we also present an explicit protocol that is
information-theoretically secure and efficient.

spreads out the energy distribution of the illumination beam in the focal plane

easily be increased as the eyepiece can be moved closer to the cornea to obtain
a Maxwellian view of the retina without compromising ocular safety. Compliance

easily obtained by preventing the presence of a laser hot spot observed in

disk formation and evolution processes in the Milky Way (MW) Galaxy. In this
paper we investigate a statistical relation between stellar Mass, Age and
Velocity Dispersion for stars in the Solar neighborhood. Age-Velocity
dispersion relations (AVR), with their applications, have been studied in
details before. But their correlation with mass was mostly neglected. To
investigate this relation, we use the proper motion data of more than 113035
stars in the Galactic disk (with Solar distances less than 150 parsecs)
provided by the third data release of the \textit{Gaia} mission and for stellar
Mass and Age, \textit{Gaia}'s Final Luminosity Age Mass Estimator
(\textit{FLAME}) is implemented. We analyze this data and the correlations
between the parameters with Random Forrest (RF) Regression, which is an
Ensemble statistical learning technique. Finally, we show that by considering
the stellar mass alongside age, we can determine Velocity Dispersions with the
average relative error, and mean absolute error of about $9\%$, and
$2.68~\rm{km/s}$, respectively. We also find that the correlation of stellar
age with Velocity Dispersion is $3$ to $8$ times more than mass, which varies
due to the different stellar types and masses.

representation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism
which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple
layers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and
poor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but
significantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this
work, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural
limitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in
computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph ViT/MLP-Mixer,
that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and
mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on Long Range Graph
Benchmark and TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and
memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges,
surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they
show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at
least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated
datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on
all of them. The source code is available for reproducibility at:

regularized as the Burgers vortex in the viscous core. There is finite
anomalous dissipation in the inviscid limit. However, in the anomalous
Hamiltonian, some terms are growing as logarithms of Reynolds number; these
terms come from the core of the Burgers vortex. In our theory, the turbulent
multifractal phenomenon is similar to asymptotic freedom in QCD, with these
logarithmic terms summed up by an RG equation. The small effective coupling
does not imply small velocity; on the contrary, velocity is large compared to
its fluctuations, which opens the way for a quantitative theory.
  In the leading order in the perturbation theory in this effective coupling
constant, we compute running multifractal dimensions for high moments of
velocity circulation, in good agreement with the data for quantum Turbulence
and available data for classical Turbulence. The logarithmic dependence of
fractal dimensions on the loop size comes from the running coupling in
anomalous dimensions. This slow logarithmic drift of fractal dimensions would
be barely observable at Reynolds numbers achievable at modern DNS.

domains. Understanding the performance of the systems under all configurations
is critical to prevent potential performance issues caused by misconfiguration.
However, as the number of configurations can be prohibitively large, it is not
possible to measure the system performance under all configurations. Thus, a
common approach is to build a prediction model from a limited measurement data
to predict the performance of all configurations as scalar values. However, it
has been pointed out that there are different sources of uncertainty coming
from the data collection or the modeling process, which can make the scalar
predictions not certainly accurate. To address this problem, we propose a
Bayesian deep learning based method, namely BDLPerf, that can incorporate
uncertainty into the prediction model. BDLPerf can provide both scalar
predictions for configurations' performance and the corresponding confidence
intervals of these scalar predictions. We also develop a novel uncertainty
calibration technique to ensure the reliability of the confidence intervals
generated by a Bayesian prediction model. Finally, we suggest an efficient
hyperparameter tuning technique so as to train the prediction model within a
reasonable amount of time whilst achieving high accuracy. Our experimental
results on 10 real-world systems show that BDLPerf achieves higher accuracy
than existing approaches, in both scalar performance prediction and confidence
interval estimation.

spontaneous symmetry breaking or topological order and has been proposed as an
example of the fermionic deconfined quantum critical point (fDQCP). Our

point while all symmetries are still preserved thanks to the quantum
fluctuations introduced by the correlation factor in the variational wave

$\nu=0.96\pm0.03$ and the fermion scaling dimension $\Delta_c=1.31\pm0.04$ at
the SMG critical point, which are consistent with the field theoretical
prediction of fDQCP in (2+1)D. These findings support the hypothesis that the
fermion fractionalizes at the SMG critical point.

an effective means to speed up block propagation in the Bitcoin network. The
compact block mechanism in Bitcoin counts on the fact that many nodes may
already have the transactions (or most of the transactions) in the block,
therefore sending the complete block containing the full transactions is
unnecessary. This fact, however, does not hold in the Ethereum network.
Adopting compact block directly in Ethereum may degrade the block propagation
speed significantly because the probability of a node not having a transaction
in the sending block is relatively high in Ethereum and requesting the missing
transactions after receiving the compact block takes much additional time. This
paper proposes hybrid-compact block (HCB), an efficient compact block
propagation scheme for Ethereum and other similar blockchains. First, we
develop a Secondary Pool to store the low-fee transactions, which are removed
from the primary transaction pool, to conserve storage space. As simple
auxiliary storage, the Secondary Pool does not affect the normal block
processing of the primary pool in Ethereum. Second, we design a machine
learning-based transaction prediction module to precisely predict the missing
transactions caused by network latency and selfish behaviors. We implemented
our HCB scheme and other compact-block-like schemes (as benchmarks) and
deployed a number of worldwide nodes over the Ethereum MainNet to
experimentally investigate them. Experimental results show that HCB performs
best among the existing compact-block-like schemes and can reduce propagation
time by more than half with respect to the current block propagation scheme in
Ethereum.

strategy for climate change. However, the variability of wind energy causes
system reliability to erode, resulting in the wind being curtailed and,
ultimately, leading to substantial economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind
curtailment can be reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) that
serve as onsite backup sources. Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly
hamper the BESS's capacity to generate revenues from the electricity market,
particularly in conducting energy arbitrage in the Spot market and providing
frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) in the FCAS markets. Ideal BESS
scheduling should effectively balance the BESS's role in absorbing onsite wind
curtailment and trading in the electricity market, but it is difficult in
practice because of the underlying coordination complexity and the stochastic
nature of energy prices and wind generation. In this study, we investigate the
bidding strategy of a wind-battery system co-located and participating
simultaneously in both the Spot and Regulation FCAS markets. We propose a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach that decouples the market
participation of the wind-battery system into two related Markov decision
processes for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite wind
curtailment while simultaneously bidding in the wholesale Spot and FCAS markets
to maximize overall operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we
validated the coordinated bidding strategy for the wind-battery system and find
that our strategy generates significantly higher revenue and responds better to
wind curtailment compared to an optimization-based benchmark. Our results show
that joint-market bidding can significantly improve the financial performance
of wind-battery systems compared to individual market participation.

artificial intelligence (AI) agents to respect humanity's best interests. Yet
what about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI
agent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for
dishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here
we present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI
agent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments,
we then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a
Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ).
In our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at
higher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical
decisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by
automating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe
higher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both
experiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude
of stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust
decisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two
conditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that
provides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those
conditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our
experiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date
alters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior
consistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.

existing tests impose strong assumptions on the underlying group covariance
matrices which may not be satisfied or hardly be checked in practice. In this
article, an F-type test for two-sample Behrens--Fisher problems for
high-dimensional data is proposed and studied. When the two samples are
normally distributed and when the null hypothesis is valid, the proposed F-type
test statistic is shown to be an F-type mixture, a ratio of two independent
chi-square-type mixtures. Under some regularity conditions and the null
hypothesis, it is shown that the proposed F-type test statistic and the above
F-type mixture have the same normal and non-normal limits. It is then justified
to approximate the null distribution of the proposed F-type test statistic by
that of the F-type mixture, resulting in the so-called normal reference F-type
test. Since the F-type mixture is a ratio of two independent chi-square-type
mixtures, we employ the Welch--Satterthwaite chi-square-approximation to the
distributions of the numerator and the denominator of the F-type mixture
respectively, resulting in an approximation F-distribution whose degrees of
freedom can be consistently estimated from the data. The asymptotic power of
the proposed F-type test is established. Two simulation studies are conducted
and they show that in terms of size control, the proposed F-type test
outperforms two existing competitors. The proposed F-type test is also
illustrated by a real data example.

underground H2 storage but are not well understood. Molecular dynamics
simulations were conducted to study interfacial properties of the H2O+H2 and
H2O+H2+silica/kerogen systems over a wide range of temperatures (298 - 523 K)
and pressures (1 - 160 MPa). The combination of the H2 model with the INTERFACE
force field and TIP4P/2005 H2O model can accurately predict the interfacial
tensions (IFTs) from the experiment. The IFTs from simulations are also in good
agreement with those from the density gradient theory coupled to the PC-SAFT
equation of state. Generally, the IFTs decrease with pressure and temperature.
However, at relatively high temperatures and pressures, the IFTs increase with
pressure. The opposite pressure effect on IFTs can be explained by the
inversion of the sign of the relative adsorption of H2. The enrichment of H2 in
the interfacial regions was observed in density profiles. Meanwhile, the
behaviours of contact angles (CAs) in the H2O+H2+silica system are noticeably
different from those in the H2O+H2+kerogen system. The H2O CAs for the
H2O+H2+silica and H2O+H2+kerogen systems increase with pressure and decrease
with temperature. However, the effect of temperature and pressure on these CAs
is less pronounced for the H2O+H2+silica system at low temperatures. The
behaviours of CAs were understood based on the variations of IFTs in the H2O+H2
system (fluid-fluid interaction) and adhesion tensions (fluid-solid
interaction). Furthermore, the analysis of the atomic density profiles shows
that the presence of H2 in between the H2O droplet and the silica/kerogen
surface is almost negligible. Nevertheless, the adsorption of H2O on the silica
surface outside the H2O droplet is strong, while less H2O adsorption is seen on
the kerogen surface.

beam search, which seeks the transcript with the greatest likelihood computed
using the predicted distribution. While showing substantial performance gains
in various tasks, beam search loses some of its effectiveness when the
predicted probabilities are highly confident, i.e., the predicted distribution
is massed for a single or very few classes. We show that recently proposed
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-based ASR models tend to yield exceptionally
confident predictions that may hamper beam search from truly considering a
diverse set of candidates. We perform a layer analysis to reveal and visualize
how predictions evolve, and propose a decoding procedure that improves the
performance of fine-tuned ASR models. Our proposed approach does not require
further training beyond the original fine-tuning, nor additional model
parameters. In fact, we find that our proposed method requires significantly
less inference computation than current approaches. We propose aggregating the
top M layers, potentially leveraging useful information encoded in intermediate
layers, and relaxing model confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach by conducting an empirical study on varying amounts of labeled
resources and different model sizes, showing consistent improvements in
particular when applied to low-resource scenarios.

understanding of opinion evolution, a.k.a. opinion dynamics, acquires

two popular models for opinion dynamics in social networks. Stochastic bounded
confidence (SBC) opinion dynamics was proposed as a general framework that
incorporates both these dynamics as special cases and also captures the
inherent stochasticity and noise (errors) in real-life social exchanges.
Although SBC dynamics is quite general and realistic, its analysis is more
challenging. This is because SBC dynamics is nonlinear and stochastic, and
belongs to the class of Markov processes that have asymptotically zero drift
and unbounded jumps. The asymptotic behavior of SBC dynamics was characterized
in prior works. However, they do not shed light on its finite-time behavior,
which is often of interest in practice. We take a stride in this direction by
analyzing the finite-time behavior of a two-agent system and a bistar graph,
which are crucial to the understanding of general multi-agent dynamics. In
particular, we show that the opinion difference between the two agents is
well-concentrated around zero under the conditions that lead to asymptotic
stability of the SBC dynamics.

illustrate that, if the DTMLG has a mirror symmetry along z direction like the
ATTLG, there exists a mirror symmetry decomposition (MSD), by which the DTMLG
can be exactly decoupled into two subsystems with opposite parity. The two
subsystems are either a twisted multilayer graphene (single twist) or a
multilayer graphene, depending on the stacking configuration. Such MSD can give
a clear interpretation about all the novel features of the moir\'{e} band
structures of DTMLG, e.g. the fourfold degenerate flat bands and the enlarged
magic angle. Meanwhile, in such DTMLG, the parity becomes a new degree of
freedom of the electrons, so that we can define a parity resolved Chern number
for the moir\'{e} flat bands. More importantly, the MSD implies that all the
novel correlated phases in the twisted multilayer graphene should also exist in
the corresponding DTMLGs, since they have the exact same Hamiltonian in form.

is outside the broad-line region, and the energy dissipation may be due to the
inverse Compton process of scattering the dust torus infrared photons, this
result is also consistent with that in Tolamatti et al. An external inverse
Compton scattering of dusty torus (DT) photons is employed to calculate the
broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). This model was further supported
by the fact that we found flare decay timescale was consistent with the cooling
time of relativistic electrons through DT photons. During the SED modeling, a
relatively harder spectrum for the electron energy distribution (EED) is found
and suggests these electrons may not be accelerated by the shock that happened
in the dissipation region. Besides, the magnetic reconnection is also ruled out
due to a low magnetization ratio. Thus, we suggest an injection of
higher-energy electrons from outside the blob and raising the flare.

2015, including the solar magnetic polarity reversal of Solar Cycle 24. The
objective is to evaluate how these simulations compare with corresponding AMS
observations for 1.0-3.0 GV, and what underlying physics follows from this
comparison in order to improve our understanding on how the major physical
modulation processes change, especially particle drift, from a negative to a
positive magnetic polarity cycle. Apart from their local interstellar spectra,
electrons and positrons differ only in their drift patterns, but they differ
with protons in other ways such as their adiabatic energy changes at lower
rigidity. In order to complete the simulations for oppositely charged
particles, antiproton modeling results are obtained as well. Together, the
observations and the corresponding modeling indicate the difference in the
drift pattern before and after the recent polarity reversal and clarify to a
large extent the phenomenon of charge-sign dependence during this period. The
effect of global particle drift became negligible during this period of no
well-defined magnetic polarity. The resulting low values of all particles' MFPs
during the polarity reversal contrast their large values during solar minimum
activity, and as such expose the relative contributions and effects of the
different modulation processes from solar minimum to maximum activity. We find
that the drift scale starts recovering just after the polarity reversal, but
the MFPs keep decreasing or remain unchanged for some period after the polarity
reversal.

highest observation priorities. For the rest of the selected stars, we gave
higher priority to the relatively brighter stars in order to obtain
high-quality spectra as many as possible. Spectra of 49129 stars have been
obtained in LAMOST-MRS-B field and released in DR8, of which 28828 and 3375

We show that the process-directed self-assembly of BCP immersed in a poor

double-spiral lamellar particles. The theory predicts a reversible path of
shape transition between onion-like particles and striped ellipsoidal ones by
regulating the temperature (related to the Flory-Huggins parameter between the
two components of BCP, $\chi_{\rm{AB}}$) and the selectivity of solvent towards
one of the two BCP components. Furthermore, a kinetic path of shape transition
from onion-like particles to double-spiral lamellar particles, and then back to
onion-like particles is demonstrated. By investigating the inner-structural
evolution of a BCP particle, we identify that changing the intermediate
bi-continuous structure into a layered one is crucial for the formation of
striped ellipsoidal particles. Another interesting finding is that the
formation of onion-like particles is characterized by a two-stage microphase
separation. The first is induced by the solvent preference, and the second is
controlled by the thermodynamics. Our findings lead to an effective way of
tailoring nanostructure of BCP particles for various industrial applications,

and graph partitioning to hypergraphs. There have been two broad directions
toward this goal. One generalizes the notion of graph conductance to hypergraph
conductance [LM16, CLTZ18]. In the second approach one can view a hypergraph as
a simplicial complex and study its various topological properties [LM06, MW09,
DKW16, PR17] and spectral properties [KM17, DK17, KO18a, KO18b, Opp20].
  In this work, we attempt to bridge these two directions of study by relating
the spectrum of {\em up-down walks} and {\em swap-walks} on the simplicial
complex to hypergraph expansion. In surprising contrast to random-walks on
graphs, we show that the spectral gap of swap-walks and up-down walks between
level $m$ and $l$ with $1 < m \leq l$ can not be used to infer any bounds on
hypergraph conductance. Moreover, we show that the spectral gap of swap-walks
between $X(1)$ and $X(k-1)$ can not be used to infer any bounds on hypergraph
conductance, whereas we give a Cheeger-like inequality relating the spectral of
walks between level $1$ and $l$ for any $l \leq k$ to hypergraph expansion.
This is a surprising difference between swaps-walks and up-down walks!
  Finally, we also give a construction to show that the well-studied notion of

effective manner to implement channel estimation (CE) in wireless communication
systems, which performance can be further improved by exploiting prior
probability models that accurately match the channel characteristics. In this
work, we study the CE problem in a downlink massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
system. As the prior probability, we propose the Markov chain two-state
Gaussian mixture with large variance differences (TSGM-LVD) model to exploit
the structured sparsity in the angle-frequency domain of the channel. Existing
single and combined MP rules cannot deal with the message computation of the
proposed probability model. To overcome this issue, we present a general method
to derive the hybrid message passing (HMP) rule, which allows the calculation
of messages described by mixed linear and non-linear functions. Accordingly, we
design the HMP-TSGM-LVD algorithm under the structured turbo framework (STF).
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges faster and
obtains better and more stable performance than its counterparts. In
particular, the gain of the proposed approach is maximum (3 dB) in the high

it is critical to provide explainability to the disease diagnosis model. To

such as binding energies, charge radii, quadrupole deformation parameter, two

the shell closure parameter are probed for the mentioned isotopic chain. For
validation, the RMF (NL3*) results are compared with those obtained from the

isotopes are found to be prolate in structure and neutron shell closures are

our analysis, a central depletion in the nucleonic density is identified in
32Ar and 42-58Ar, indicating them as possible candidates for a semi-bubble-like
structure. Interestingly, these results are consistent with recent theoretical
and experimentally measured data. Besides, using the Glauber model, the
reaction cross-sections are determined by taking 26-48Ar as projectiles and
stable targets such as 12C, 16O, 40Ca, 90Zr, 124,132Sn, 208Pb and 304120.

stable nucleus. A relatively higher cross-section value is noticed between 30Ar

introduce a novel, cost-effective, and versatile foot sensor to detect the
proximity of the robot's feet to the ground (bump sensor). By employing this
sensor, feedback controllers are implemented to reduce the impact forces during
the transition of the swing to stance phase or steeping on inclined unseen
obstacles. Compared to conventional sensors based on contact reaction force,
this sensor detects the distance to the ground or obstacles before the foot
touches the obstacle and therefore provides predictive information to
anticipate the obstacles. The controller of the proposed bump sensor interacts
with another admittance controller to adjust leg length. The walking
experiments show successful locomotion on the unseen inclined obstacle without
reducing the locomotion speed with a slope angle of 12. Foot position error
causes a hard impact with the ground as a consequence of accumulative error
caused by links and connections' deflection (which is manufactured by
university tools). The proposed framework drastically reduces the feet' impact
with the ground.

given natural language expression. Typically, referring expressions contain
complex relationships between the target and its surrounding objects. The main
challenge of this task is to understand the visual and linguistic content
simultaneously and to find the referred object accurately among all instances
in the image. Currently, the most effective way to solve the above problem is
to obtain aligned multi-modal features by computing the correlation between
visual and linguistic feature modalities under the supervision of the
ground-truth mask. However, existing paradigms have difficulty in thoroughly
understanding visual and linguistic content due to the inability to perceive
information directly about surrounding objects that refer to the target. This
prevents them from learning aligned multi-modal features, which leads to
inaccurate segmentation. To address this issue, we present a position-aware
contrastive alignment network (PCAN) to enhance the alignment of multi-modal
features by guiding the interaction between vision and language through prior
position information. Our PCAN consists of two modules: 1) Position Aware
Module (PAM), which provides position information of all objects related to
natural language descriptions, and 2) Contrastive Language Understanding Module
(CLUM), which enhances multi-modal alignment by comparing the features of the
referred object with those of related objects. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate our PCAN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art

evaluate its performance, we have measured several related parameters such as

these metrics are investigated for encryption/decryption algorithms of PKC-PC

quasi-split symmetric subgroup of $G_k$ with respect to an involution
$\theta_k$ of $G_k$. The classification of such involutions is independent of
the characteristic of $k$ (provided not $2$).
  We first construct a closed subgroup scheme $\mathbf{G}^\imath$ of the
Chevalley group scheme $\mathbf{G}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. The pair $(\mathbf{G},
\mathbf{G}^\imath)$ parameterizes symmetric pairs of the given type over any
algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq 2$, that is, the geometric
fibre of $\mathbf{G}^\imath$ becomes the reductive group $K_k \subset G_k$ over
any algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$. As a
consequence, we show the coordinate ring of the group $K_k$ is spanned by the
dual $\imath$canonical basis of the corresponding $\imath$quantum group.
  We then construct a quantum Frobenius splitting for the quasi-split
$\imath$quantum group at roots of $1$. This generalizes Lusztig's quantum
Frobenius splitting for quantum groups at roots of $1$. Over a field of
positive characteristic, our quantum Frobenius splitting induces a Frobenius
splitting of the algebraic group $K_k$.
  Finally, we construct Frobenius splittings of the flag variety $G_k / B_k$
that compatibly split certain $K_k$-orbit closures over positive
characteristics. We deduce cohomological vanishings of line bundles as well as
normalities. Results apply to characteristic $0$ as well, thanks to the

gravitational anomalies (of Chern-Simons (CS) type) at early epochs, and a
totally-antisymmetric torsion, dual to a massless axion-like field
(""gravitational axion""), which couples to the CS term. Under appropriate
conditions, primordial gravitational waves can condense, leading to a
condensate of the CS anomaly term. As a consequence, one obtains inflation in
this theory, of running-vacuum-model (RVM) type, without the need for external
inflatons. At the end of the inflationary era, chiral fermionic matter is
generated, whose gravitational anomalies cancel the primordial ones. On the
other hand, chiral anomalies of gauge type, which are also generated by the
chiral matter, remain present during the post-inflationary epochs and become
responsible for the generation of a non-perturbative mass for the
torsion-related gravitational axion, which, in this way, might play the role of
a Dark Matter component of geometrical origin. Moreover, in this model, stringy
non-perturbative effects during the RVM inflationary phase generate periodic
structures for the potential of axion-like particles that arise due to
compactification, and co-exist with the gravitational axions. Such periodic
potential modulations may lead to an enhanced production of primordial black
holes during inflation, which in turn affects the profile of the generated
gravitational waves during the radiation era, with potentially observable
consequences. This model also entails an unconventional mechanism for
Leptogenesis, due to Lorentz-violating backgrounds of the gravitational axions
that are generated during inflation, as a consequence of the anomaly
condensates, and remain undiluted in the radiation era.

  Domain Adaptation for Long-term Breast Cancer Risk",,,,,"cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Purpose: Risk-stratified breast cancer screening might improve early
detection and efficiency without comprising quality. However, modern
mammography-based risk models do not ensure adaptation across vendor-domains
and rely on cancer precursors, associated with short-term risk, which might
limit long-term risk assessment. We report a cross-vendor mammographic texture
model for long-term risk. Approach: The texture model was robustly trained
using two systematically designed case-control datasets. Textural features,
indicative of future breast cancer, were learned by excluding samples with
diagnosed/potential malignancies from training. An augmentation-based domain
adaption technique, based on flavorization of mammographic views, ensured
generalization across vendor-domains. The model was validated in 66,607
consecutively screened Danish women with flavorized Siemens views and 25,706
Dutch women with Hologic-processed views. Performances were evaluated for
interval cancers (IC) within two years from screening and long-term cancers
(LTC) from two years after screening. The texture model was combined with
established risk factors to flag 10% of women with the highest risk. Results:
In Danish women, the texture model achieved an area under the receiver
operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.71 and 0.65 for ICs and LTCs, respectively.
In Dutch women with Hologic-processed views, the AUCs were not different from
AUCs in Danish women with flavorized views. The AUC for texture combined with
established risk factors increased to 0.68 for LTCs. The 10% of women flagged
as high-risk accounted for 25.5% of ICs and 24.8% of LTCs. Conclusions: The
texture model robustly estimated long-term breast cancer risk while adapting to
an unseen processed vendor-domain and identified a clinically relevant
high-risk subgroup.

our condition guarantees a well-ordered asymptotic behaviour of the closed-loop

necessarily unique. We demonstrate our results by deriving a sufficient
condition for $k$-contraction of a general networked system, and then applying
it to guarantee $k$-contraction in a Hopfield neural network, a nonlinear

evaluate image segmentation methods. The metric is based on a confusion table,
and compares a predicted to a ground truth segmentation. The only non
straightforward part in this comparison is to align the segments in the two
segmentations. A metric only works well if that alignment is a partial
bijection. Kirilov et al (2019) list 3 desirable properties for a definition of
alignment: it should be simple, interpretable and effectively computable. There
are many definitions guaranteeing a partial bijection and these 3 properties.
We present the weakest: one that is both sufficient and necessary to guarantee
that the alignment is a partial bijection. This new condition is effectively
computable and natural. It simply says that the number of correctly predicted
elements (in image segmentation, the pixels) should be larger than the number
of missed, and larger than the number of spurious elements. This is strictly
weaker than the proposal in Kirilov et al (2019). In formulas, instead of |TP|>
|FN\textbar| + |FP|, the weaker condition requires that |TP|> |FN| and |TP| >
|FP|. We evaluate the new alignment condition theoretically and empirically.

notion of hierarchy among the objects tagged with the same primer pair and
enables efficient data updates. In contrast to prior work, in our architecture
a pair of PCR primers of length 20 does not define a single object, but an
independent storage partition, which is internally managed in an independent
way with its own index structure. We make the observation that, while the
number of mutually compatible primer pairs is limited, the internal address
space available to any pair of primers (i.e., partition) is virtually
unlimited. We expose and leverage the flexibility with which this address space
can be managed to provide rich and functional storage semantics, such as
hierarchical data organization and efficient and flexible implementations of
data updates. Furthermore, to leverage the full power of the prefix-based
nature of PCR addressing, we define a methodology for transforming an arbitrary
indexing scheme into a PCR-compatible equivalent. This allows us to run PCR
with primers that can be variably extended to include a desired part of the
index, and thus narrow down the scope of the reaction to retrieve a specific
object (e.g., file or directory) within the partition with high precision. Our
wetlab evaluation demonstrates the practicality of the proposed ideas and shows
140x reduction in sequencing cost retrieval of smaller objects within the
partition.

strangeness that can be easily incorporated into any centralized training and

the degree of unfamiliarity of the observations that an agent visits. In order
to give the observation strangeness a global perspective, it is also augmented
with the the degree of unfamiliarity of the visited entire state. The
exploration bonus is obtained from the strangeness and the proposed exploration
method is not much affected by stochastic transitions commonly observed in MARL
tasks. To prevent a high exploration bonus from making the MARL training
insensitive to extrinsic rewards, we also propose a separate action-value
function trained by both extrinsic reward and exploration bonus, on which a
behavioral policy to generate transitions is designed based. It makes the
CTDE-based MARL algorithms more stable when they are used with an exploration
method. Through a comparative evaluation in didactic examples and the StarCraft
Multi-Agent Challenge, we show that the proposed exploration method achieves
significant performance improvement in the CTDE-based MARL algorithms.

Although several effective methods for this problem, topic-to-essay generation,

utilizes the Transformer architecture where the encoder is enriched with
domain-specific contexts while the decoder is enhanced by a large-scale
pre-trained language model. Specifically, a \emph{Topic-Extension} layer
capturing the interaction between the given topics and their domain-specific
contexts is plugged into the encoder. Since the given topics are usually
concise and sparse, such an additional layer can bring more topic-related
semantics in to facilitate the subsequent natural language generation.
Moreover, an \emph{Embedding-Fusion} module that combines the domain-specific
word embeddings learnt from the given corpus and the general-purpose word
embeddings provided by a GPT-2 model pre-trained on massive text data is
integrated into the decoder. Since GPT-2 is at a much larger scale, it contains
a lot more implicit linguistic knowledge which would help the decoder to
produce more grammatical and readable text. Extensive experiments have shown
that the pieces of text generated by TegFormer have better topic coverage and
higher text coherence than those from SOTA topic-to-essay techniques, according
to automatic and human evaluations. As revealed by ablation studies, both the
Topic-Extension layer and the Embedding-Fusion module contribute substantially

$C$, that defines the quantized Hall conductance as $S_{xy}= C e^2/h$.
Increasing $C$ is pivotal for the realization of low-power-consumption
topological electronics, but there has been no clear-cut solution of this
problem so far, with the majority of existing Chern insulators showing $C=1$.
Here, by using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, we propose an efficient
approach for the realization of the high-$C$ Chern insulator state in
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/hBN van der Waals multilayer heterostructures. We show that a
stack of $n$ MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films with $C=1$ intercalated by hBN monolayers
gives rise to a high Chern number state with $C=n$, characterized by $n$ chiral
edge modes. This state can be achieved both under the external magnetic field
and without it, both cases leading to the quantized Hall conductance $S_{xy}= C
e^2/h$. Our results therefore pave way to practical high-$C$ quantized Hall
systems.

unprecedentedly rich style transfer from a style image to a content image and
is particularly impressive when it comes to transferring style from a painting
to an image. It was originally achieved by solving an optimization problem to
match the global style statistics of the style image while preserving the local
geometric features of the content image. The two main drawbacks of this
original approach is that it is computationally expensive and that the
resolution of the output images is limited by high GPU memory requirements.
Many solutions have been proposed to both accelerate neural style transfer and
increase its resolution, but they all compromise the quality of the produced
images. Indeed, transferring the style of a painting is a complex task
involving features at different scales, from the color palette and
compositional style to the fine brushstrokes and texture of the canvas. This
paper provides a solution to solve the original global optimization for
ultra-high resolution images, enabling multiscale style transfer at
unprecedented image sizes. This is achieved by spatially localizing the
computation of each forward and backward passes through the VGG network.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons show that our method
produces a style transfer of unmatched quality for such high resolution
painting styles.

asymmetry of the Josephson inductance as a function of the supercurrent --
allows us to probe the current-phase relation near equilibrium. Using a minimal
theoretical model, we can then link the sign reversal of the AC diode effect to
the so-called 0-$\pi$-like transition, a predicted, but still elusive feature

in achieving top-performing results in the recognition of 3D shapes. These
methods involve learning how to combine information from multiple view-points.
However, the camera view-points from which these views are obtained are often
fixed for all shapes. To overcome the static nature of current multi-view
techniques, we propose learning these view-points. Specifically, we introduce
the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN), which uses differentiable
rendering to determine optimal view-points for 3D shape recognition. As a
result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end with any multi-view network for 3D shape
classification. We integrate MVTN into a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline
that is capable of rendering both 3D meshes and point clouds. Our approach
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification and shape
retrieval on several benchmarks (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55).
Further analysis indicates that our approach exhibits improved robustness to
occlusion compared to other methods. We also investigate additional aspects of
MVTN, such as 2D pretraining and its use for segmentation. To support further
research in this area, we have released MVTorch, a PyTorch library for 3D

from possibly sparse data is to calibrate the parameter of a given constitutive
model using a Bayesian update. After calibration, a (stochastic) forward
simulation is conducted with the identified model parameters to resolve
physical fields in regions that were not accessible to the measurement device.
A shortcoming of model calibration is that the model is deemed to best
represent reality, which is only sometimes the case, especially in the context
of the aging of structures and materials. While this issue is often addressed
with repeated model calibration, a different approach is followed in the
recently proposed statistical Finite Element Method (statFEM). Instead of using
Bayes' theorem to update model parameters, the displacement is chosen as the
stochastic prior and updated to fit the measurement data more closely. For this
purpose, the statFEM framework introduces a so-called model-reality mismatch,
parametrized by only three hyperparameters. This makes the inference of
full-field data computationally efficient in an online stage: If the stochastic
prior can be computed offline, solving the underlying partial differential
equation (PDE) online is unnecessary. Compared to solving a PDE, identifying
only three hyperparameters and conditioning the state on the sensor data
requires much fewer computational resources.
  This paper presents two contributions to the existing statFEM approach:
First, we use a non-intrusive polynomial chaos method to compute the prior,
enabling the use of complex mechanical models in deterministic formulations.
Second, we examine the influence of prior material models (linear elastic and
St.Venant Kirchhoff material with uncertain Young's modulus) on the updated
solution. We present statFEM results for 1D and 2D examples, while an extension
to 3D is straightforward.

either linear autoencoders or specific training regimes (leading to vanishing
or diverging compression rates). Our paper addresses this gap by focusing on
non-linear two-layer autoencoders trained in the challenging proportional
regime in which the input dimension scales linearly with the size of the
representation. Our results characterize the minimizers of the population risk,
and show that such minimizers are achieved by gradient methods; their structure
is also unveiled, thus leading to a concise description of the features
obtained via training. For the special case of a sign activation function, our
analysis establishes the fundamental limits for the lossy compression of
Gaussian sources via (shallow) autoencoders. Finally, while the results are
proved for Gaussian data, numerical simulations on standard datasets display
the universality of the theoretical predictions.

successive variants and was largest during the Omicron BA.1 period. Before the
Delta period, almost all infections were primary infections occurring in naive

between the rotating potential and TE-TM splitting of polariton modes offers a
tool of control over the spin state and the angular momentum of the condensate.
Specific selection rules describing the coupling of pseudospin and angular
momentum are formulated. The resonant coupling between states having linear and
circular polarizations leads to the polarization beats. The effect may be seen
as a polariton analogy to the electronic magnetic resonance in the presence of
constant and rotating magnetic fields. Remarkably, spin beats are induced by a
purely mechanical rotation of the condensate.

address issues not covered by existing m-learning apps. In this article, by
means of a systematic literature review that covers 62 publications placed in
the hype of teacher-created m-learning apps (between 2012 and 2017, the early
adopters) and the usage of 71 apps, we have analysed the use of specific
m-learning apps. Our results show that apps have been used both out of the
classroom to develop autonomous learning or field trips, and in the classroom,
mainly, for collaborative activities. The experiences analysed only develop low
level outcomes and the results obtained are positive improving learning,
learning performance, and attitude. As a conclusion of this study is that the
results obtained with specific developed apps are quite similar to previous
general surveys and that the development of long-term experiences are required
to determine the real effect of instructional designs based on mobile devices.
These designs should also be oriented to evaluate high level skills and take
advantage of mobile features of mobile devices to develop learning activities
that be made anytime at anyplace and taking into account context and realistic
situations. Furthermore, it is considered relevant the study of the role of
educational mobile development frameworks in facilitating teachers the

with low Reynold's number such as microbial and particle-laden suspensions, and
proteins diffusing in membranes. Unfortunately, while far-field (asymptotic)
hydrodynamic interactions are fully understood in two- and three-dimensions,
near-field interactions are not, and thus our understanding of motions in dense
fluid suspensions is still lacking. In this contribution, we experimentally
explore the hydrodynamic correlations between particles in
quasi-two-dimensional colloidal fluids in the near-field. Surprisingly, the
measured displacement and relaxation of particle pairs in the body frame
exhibit direction-dependent dynamics that can be connected quantitatively to
the measured near-field hydrodynamic interactions. These findings, in turn,
suggest a mechanism for how and when hydrodynamics can lead to a breakdown of
the ubiquitous Stokes-Einstein relation (SER). We observe this breakdown, and
interestingly, we show that the direction-dependent breakdown of the SER is
ameliorated along directions where hydrodynamic correlations are smallest. In
total, the work uncovers significant ramifications of near-field hydrodynamics
on transport and dynamic restructuring of fluids in two-dimensions.

cation-ordering, characterised by favourable OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen coordination
with a preference for polar cis-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ over non-polar
trans-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ configurations. This preference for polar cation
configurations produces long-range disorder, in agreement with experimental
data. The predicted short-range-order preference contrasts with that for a
simple point-charge model, which instead predicts preferential
trans-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen coordination and corresponding long-range
crystallographic order. The absence of long-range order in Li$_2$FeSO can
therefore be attributed to the relative stability of cis-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ and
other non-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen-coordination motifs. We show that this effect is
associated with the polarisation of oxide and sulfide anions in polar
coordination environments, which stabilises these polar short-range cation
orderings. We propose similar anion-polarisation-directed short-range-ordering
may be present in other heterocationic materials that contain cations with
different formal charges. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of
using simple point-charge models to predict the structure of cation-disordered

role in directing both short- and long-range structural correlations.

than healthy people. However, DR is the leading cause of blindness. At present,
the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy mainly relies on the experienced
clinician to recognize the fine features in color fundus images. This is a
time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, to promote the development of
UW-OCTA DR automatic detection, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic
segmentation method for UW-OCTA DR image grade assessment. This method, first,
uses the MAE algorithm to perform semi-supervised pre-training on the UW-OCTA
DR grade assessment dataset to mine the supervised information in the UW-OCTA
images, thereby alleviating the need for labeled data. Secondly, to more fully
mine the lesion features of each region in the UW-OCTA image, this paper
constructs a cross-algorithm ensemble DR tissue segmentation algorithm by
deploying three algorithms with different visual feature processing strategies.
The algorithm contains three sub-algorithms, namely pre-trained MAE, ConvNeXt,
and SegFormer. Based on the initials of these three sub-algorithms, the
algorithm can be named MCS-DRNet. Finally, we use the MCS-DRNet algorithm as an
inspector to check and revise the results of the preliminary evaluation of the
DR grade evaluation algorithm. The experimental results show that the mean dice
similarity coefficient of MCS-DRNet v1 and v2 are 0.5161 and 0.5544,
respectively. The quadratic weighted kappa of the DR grading evaluation is
0.7559. Our code will be released soon.

effects in the dynamics can be introduced by allowing these ancillas to
interact. We study in detail the behaviour of the steady-state ergotropy and
the impact of the information backflow to the system on the different features
characterizing the charging process. Remarkably, we find that there is a
maximum value of the ergotropy achievable: this value can be obtained either in
the presence of memoryless environment, but only in the large-loss limit, as
derived in [D. Farina et al., Phys. Rev. B 99, 035421 (2019)], or in the
presence of an environment with memory also beyond the large-loss limit. In
general, we show that the presence of an environment with memory allows us to
generate steady-state ergotropy near to its maximum value for a much larger
region in the parameter space and thus potentially in a shorter time. Relying
on the geometrical measure of non-Markovianity, we show that in both the cases
of an environment with and without memory the ergotropy maximum is obtained
when the non-Markovianity of the dynamics of the battery is zero, possibly as
the result of a non-trivial interplay between the memory effects induced by,

Then, take each grid block with different sizes and shapes inversely
transformed into a rectangle with exactly the same shape and size. Finally,

roughly flat rectangle. This paper will introduce and show the specific process

been studied using radioactive source and $({\rm p},\gamma)$ reactions. The
inherent energy resolution of $1.6\%+2\%/E_{\gamma}^{1/2}$ is obtained.
Reconstruction method has been established through Geant 4 simulations,

$2.6\times 10^{-4}$ against the $4\pi$ emissions at the target position,
exhibiting insignificant dependence on the energy of incident $\gamma$ rays

seriously affects subsequent applications. Traditional hand-crafted denoisers
such as filters and regularizations utilize interpretable domain knowledge to
design generalizable denoising techniques, while their representation
capacities may be inferior to deep learning denoisers, which can learn complex
and representative denoising mappings from abundant training pairs. However,
due to the scarcity of high-quality training pairs, deep learning denoisers may
sustain some generalization issues over various scenarios. In this work, we
propose a self-supervised method that combines the capacities of deep denoiser
and the generalization abilities of hand-crafted regularization for seismic
data random noise attenuation. Specifically, we leverage the Self2Self (S2S)
learning framework with a trace-wise masking strategy for seismic data
denoising by solely using the observed noisy data. Parallelly, we suggest the
weighted total variation (WTV) to further capture the horizontal local smooth
structure of seismic data. Our method, dubbed as S2S-WTV, enjoys both high
representation abilities brought from the self-supervised deep network and good
generalization abilities of the hand-crafted WTV regularizer and the
self-supervised nature. Therefore, our method can more effectively and stably
remove the random noise and preserve the details and edges of the clean signal.
To tackle the S2S-WTV optimization model, we introduce an alternating direction
multiplier method (ADMM)-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on synthetic

consumption of high-resolution content without perceivable drop in quality. Eye
trackers provide us the gaze direction of a user, aiding us in the extraction
of the regional high-resolution context. As only pixels that falls within the
gaze region can be resolved by the human eye, a large amount of the delivered
content is redundant as we can't perceive the difference in quality of the
region beyond the observed region. To generate a visually pleasing frame from
the fusion of high-resolution region and low-resolution region, we study the
capability of a deep neural network of transferring the context of the observed
region to other regions (low-resolution) of the current and future frames. We
label this task a Foveated Video Super-Resolution (FVSR), as we need to
super-resolve the low-resolution regions of current and future frames through

makes future 6G wireless communications likely to operate in the near-field

both the user angle and distance is more accurate than the conventional planar
one that is only related to the user angle. Therefore, the conventional planar
wave based far-field channel model as well as its associated estimation
algorithms needs to be reconsidered. Here we first propose a
distance-parameterized angular-domain sparse model to represent the near-field
channel. In this model, the user distance is included in the dictionary as an
unknown parameter, so that the number of dictionary columns depends only on the
angular space division. This is different from the existing polar-domain
near-field channel model where the dictionary is constructed on an
angle-distance two-dimensional (2D) space. Next, based on this model, joint
dictionary learning and sparse recovery based channel estimation methods are
proposed for both line of sight (LoS) and multi-path settings. To further
demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms, recovery conditions
and computational complexity are studied. Our analysis shows that with the
decrease of distance estimation error in the dictionary, the angular-domain
sparse vector can be exactly recovered after a few iterations. The high storage
burden and dictionary coherence issues that arise in the polar-domain 2D
representation are well addressed. Finally, simulations in multi-user
communication scenarios support the superiority of the proposed near-field

Au cores surrounded by ""coronas"" of S1 domains of the virus's Spike protein.
Importantly, they are safe to use and specifically interact with SARS-CoV-2

Within our studies, the effect allowed us to visualize the interaction between

attributes available in the data set (like the grades), with a personalized

normal, unbalance, misalignment, and bearing fault. Three machine learning
methods (SVM, KNN, and GNB) evaluated the dataset, and a perfect result was
obtained by one of the methods on a 1-fold test. The performance of the

turn existing fibre optic networks to distributed acoustic sensors. However, it
faces the challenges of transmitting, storing, and processing massive streams
of data which are orders of magnitude larger than that collected from point
sensors. The gap between intensive data generated by DAS and modern computing
system with limited reading/writing speed and storage capacity imposes
restrictions on many applications. Compressive sensing (CS) is a revolutionary
signal acquisition method that allows a signal to be acquired and reconstructed
with significantly fewer samples than that required by Nyquist-Shannon theorem.
Though the data size is greatly reduced in the sampling stage, the
reconstruction of the compressed data is however time and computation
consuming. To address this challenge, we propose to map the feature extractor
from Nyquist-domain to compressed-domain and therefore vibration detection and
classification can be directly implemented in compressed-domain. The measured
results show that our framework can be used to reduce the transmitted data size
by 70% while achieves 99.4% true positive rate (TPR) and 0.04% false positive

(AG-MLAN) to learn fine-grained fashion similarity. AG-MLAN is able to make a
more accurate attribute positioning and capture more discriminative features
under the guidance of the specified attribute. Specifically, the AG-MLAN
contains two branches, branch 1 aims to force the model to recognize different
attributes, while branch 2 aims to learn multiple attribute-specific embedding
spaces for measuring the fine-grained similarity. We first improve the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone to extract hierarchical feature
representations, then the extracted feature representations are passed into
branch 1 for attribute classification and branch 2 for multi-level feature
extraction. In branch 2, we first propose a multi-level attention module to
extract a more discriminative representation under the guidance of a specific
attribute. Then, we adopt a masked embedding module to learn attribute-aware
embedding. Finally, the AG-MLAN is trained with a weighted loss of the
classification loss in branch 1 and the triplet loss of the masked embedding
features in branch 2 to further improve the accuracy in attribute location.
Extensive experiments on the DeepFashion, FashionAI, and Zappos50k datasets
show the effectiveness of AG-MLAN for fine-grained fashion similarity learning
and its potential for attribute-guided retrieval tasks. The proposed AG-MLAN
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the fine-grained fashion similarity
