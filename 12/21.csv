have little understanding of how they represent text, and why this leads to
good performance. In this work, we shed light on this question via
distributions over the vocabulary. We propose to interpret the vector
representations produced by dual encoders by projecting them into the model's
vocabulary space. We show that the resulting projections contain rich semantic
information, and draw connection between them and sparse retrieval. We find
that this view can offer an explanation for some of the failure cases of dense
retrievers. For example, we observe that the inability of models to handle tail
entities is correlated with a tendency of the token distributions to forget
some of the tokens of those entities. We leverage this insight and propose a
simple way to enrich query and passage representations with lexical information
at inference time, and show that this significantly improves performance
compared to the original model in zero-shot settings, and specifically on the
BEIR benchmark.

impressive accuracy on standard Wikipedia style benchmarks. However, it is less
clear how robust these models are and how well they perform when applied to
real-world applications in drastically different domains. While there has been
some work investigating how well ODQA models perform when tested for
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, these studies have been conducted only
under conservative shifts in data distribution and typically focus on a single
component (ie. retrieval) rather than an end-to-end system. In response, we
propose a more realistic and challenging domain shift evaluation setting and,
through extensive experiments, study end-to-end model performance. We find that
not only do models fail to generalize, but high retrieval scores often still
yield poor answer prediction accuracy. We then categorize different types of
shifts and propose techniques that, when presented with a new dataset, predict
if intervention methods are likely to be successful. Finally, using insights
from this analysis, we propose and evaluate several intervention methods which
improve end-to-end answer F1 score by up to 24 points.

performance bottleneck for low-latency queries. To reduce query latency, one
can replicate remote data to make distributed traversals unnecessary, but
replication is expensive and should be minimized. In this paper, we introduce
the problem of finding data replication schemes that satisfy arbitrary

propose a novel workload model to express data access causality, propose a

this paper, we introduce a Unified Domain Adaptive 3D semantic segmentation
pipeline (UniDA3D) to enhance the weak generalization ability, and bridge the
point distribution gap between domains. Different from previous studies that
only focus on a single adaptation task, UniDA3D can tackle several adaptation
tasks in 3D segmentation field, by designing a unified source-and-target active
sampling strategy, which selects a maximally-informative subset from both
source and target domains for effective model adaptation. Besides, benefiting
from the rise of multi-modal 2D-3D datasets, UniDA3D investigates the
possibility of achieving a multi-modal sampling strategy, by developing a
cross-modality feature interaction module that can extract a representative
pair of image and point features to achieve a bi-directional image-point
feature interaction for safe model adaptation. Experimentally, UniDA3D is
verified to be effective in many adaptation tasks including: 1) unsupervised
domain adaptation, 2) unsupervised few-shot domain adaptation; 3) active domain
adaptation. Their results demonstrate that, by easily coupling UniDA3D with
off-the-shelf 3D segmentation baselines, domain generalization ability of these

a shortcut and thus fail to sufficiently learn the interaction between the
targets and texts. Recent debiasing methods usually treated features learned by
small models or big models at earlier steps as bias features and proposed to
exclude the branch learning those bias features during inference. However, most
of these methods fail to disentangle the ``good'' stance features and ``bad''
bias features in the text part. In this paper, we investigate how to mitigate
dataset bias in stance detection. Motivated by causal effects, we leverage a
novel counterfactual inference framework, which enables us to capture the
dataset bias in the text part as the direct causal effect of the text on
stances and reduce the dataset bias in the text part by subtracting the direct
text effect from the total causal effect. We novelly model bias features as
features that correlate with the stance labels but fail on intermediate stance
reasoning subtasks and propose an adversarial bias learning module to model the
bias more accurately. To verify whether our model could better model the
interaction between texts and targets, we test our model on recently proposed
test sets to evaluate the understanding of the task from various aspects.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method (1) could better model the
bias features, and (2) outperforms existing debiasing baselines on both the

within the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT, whose backreaction gives rise to the
$\text{AdS}_2$ solution. We construct the explicit quiver quantum mechanics
that flows in the IR to the dual SCQM, and show that it can be embedded within
the quiver CFT associated to the $\text{AdS}_5$ solution. The quiver quantum
mechanics arises from a brane box set-up of D2-branes stretched between
perpendicular NS5-branes, that we construct from the $\text{AdS}_2$ solution.
We provide non-trivial checks of our proposed duality. Our construction
provides one further example of the successful applications of non-Abelian
T-duality to holography, in this case in providing a very non-trivial
connection between $\text{AdS}_2$ solutions, line defects and brane boxes.

novel mixed contrastive objective is proposed to explicitly optimize the
implicit knowledge elicitation process of LMs, and thus reduce their
hallucination in conversations. We also examine negative sampling strategies of
retrieved hard negatives and model-generated negatives. We conduct experiments
on Wizard-of-Wikipedia, a public, open-domain knowledge-grounded dialogue

hallucination of LMs in conversations and achieves the highest performance

The resulting competition between crystal-field and spin-orbit-coupling

hard to achieve high agreement among annotators in subjective tasks such as
hate speech detection. Existing neural network models principally regard labels
as categorical variables, while ignoring the semantic information in diverse
label texts. In this paper, we propose AnnoBERT, a first-of-its-kind
architecture integrating annotator characteristics and label text with a
transformer-based model to detect hate speech, with unique representations
based on each annotator's characteristics via Collaborative Topic Regression
(CTR) and integrate label text to enrich textual representations. During
training, the model associates annotators with their label choices given a
piece of text; during evaluation, when label information is not available, the
model predicts the aggregated label given by the participating annotators by
utilising the learnt association. The proposed approach displayed an advantage
in detecting hate speech, especially in the minority class and edge cases with
annotator disagreement. Improvement in the overall performance is the largest
when the dataset is more label-imbalanced, suggesting its practical value in
identifying real-world hate speech, as the volume of hate speech in-the-wild is
extremely small on social media, when compared with normal (non-hate) speech.
Through ablation studies, we show the relative contributions of annotator
embeddings and label text to the model performance, and tested a range of
alternative annotator embeddings and label text combinations.

any particular assumption on invariance under boosts, we show that a linear

assuming the existence of quasiparticles, our criterion matches Landau's

of ultra-thin films. We show that, within a given time range, the thinning
dynamics of submicron thick films is governed by the thermocapillary stress. It
results in a simple dependency of the thickness profiles with time, which is
evidenced by the collapse of the data onto a master curve. The master curve
only depends on the liquid properties and on the thermal gradient, and allows a
measurement of the latter. As the films further thin down to thicknesses within
the range of molecular interactions, a deviation from the master curve appears.
Although all investigated oils are supposedly fully wetting glass, the nature
of the deviation differs between alkanes and silicone oils. We attribute the
observed behaviors to differing signs of disjoining pressures, and this picture
is confirmed by numerical resolution of the thin-film equation. We suggest
thermocapillary flows can be used to finely probe molecular interactions.

These two classes of potentials comprise the asymptotic behaviour of several
classes of scalar field potentials, and, therefore, they provide the skeleton
for the typical behaviour of arbitrary potentials. Moreover, we analyse the
linear cosmological perturbations in the matterless case by considering three
scalar perturbations: the evolution of the Bardeen potentials, the comoving
curvature perturbation, the so-called Sasaki-Mukhanov variable, or the scalar
field perturbation in uniform curvature gauge. Finally, an exhaustive dynamical
system analysis for each scalar perturbation is presented, including the
evolution of Bardeen potentials in the presence of matter.

Riemannian Networks (DRNs) possibly combining the advantages of both previous
classes of methods. However, there are still a range of topics where additional
insight is needed to pave the way for a more widespread application of DRNs in

end-to-end ability as well as model training questions. How these factors
affect model performance has not been explored. Additionally, it is not clear
how the data within these networks is transformed, and whether this would
correlate with traditional EEG decoding. Our study aims to lay the groundwork
in the area of these topics through the analysis of DRNs for EEG with a wide
range of hyperparameters. Networks were tested on two public EEG datasets and
compared with state-of-the-art ConvNets. Here we propose end-to-end EEG SPDNet
(EE(G)-SPDNet), and we show that this wide, end-to-end DRN can outperform the
ConvNets, and in doing so use physiologically plausible frequency regions. We
also show that the end-to-end approach learns more complex filters than
traditional band-pass filters targeting the classical alpha, beta, and gamma
frequency bands of the EEG, and that performance can benefit from channel
specific filtering approaches. Additionally, architectural analysis revealed
areas for further improvement due to the possible loss of Riemannian specific
information throughout the network. Our study thus shows how to design and
train DRNs to infer task-related information from the raw EEG without the need

popular in a variety of applications, however, they come at substantial
computational costs, accompanied by high energy demands. In contrast, hardware
capabilities are limited and there is evidence that technology scaling is
stuttering, therefore, new approaches to meet the performance demands of
increasingly complex model architectures are required. As an unsafe
optimization, noisy computations are more energy efficient, and given a fixed
power budget also more time efficient. However, any kind of unsafe optimization
requires counter measures to ensure functionally correct results.
  This work considers noisy computations in an abstract form, and gears to
understand the implications of such noise on the accuracy of
neural-network-based classifiers as an exemplary workload. We propose a
methodology called ""Walking Noise"" that allows to assess the robustness of
different layers of deep architectures by means of a so-called ""midpoint noise
level"" metric. We then investigate the implications of additive and
multiplicative noise for different classification tasks and model
architectures, with and without batch normalization. While noisy training
significantly increases robustness for both noise types, we observe a clear
trend to increase weights and thus increase the signal-to-noise ratio for
additive noise injection. For the multiplicative case, we find that some
networks, with suitably simple tasks, automatically learn an internal binary
representation, hence becoming extremely robust. Overall this work proposes a
method to measure the layer-specific robustness and shares first insights on
how networks learn to compensate injected noise, and thus, contributes to
understand robustness against noisy computations.

conveying a desired meaning to its destination. We model the
transmitter-receiver functionalities as an autoencoder followed by a task
classifier that evaluates the meaning of the information conveyed to the
receiver. The autoencoder consists of an encoder at the transmitter to jointly
model source coding, channel coding, and modulation, and a decoder at the
receiver to jointly model demodulation, channel decoding and source decoding.
By augmenting the reconstruction loss with a semantic loss, the two deep neural
networks (DNNs) of this encoder-decoder pair are interactively trained with the
DNN of the semantic task classifier. This approach effectively captures the
latent feature space and reliably transfers compressed feature vectors with a
small number of channel uses while keeping the semantic loss low. We identify
the multi-domain security vulnerabilities of using the DNNs for semantic
communications. Based on adversarial machine learning, we introduce test-time
(targeted and non-targeted) adversarial attacks on the DNNs by manipulating
their inputs at different stages of semantic communications. As a computer
vision attack, small perturbations are injected to the images at the input of
the transmitter's encoder. As a wireless attack, small perturbations signals
are transmitted to interfere with the input of the receiver's decoder. By
launching these stealth attacks individually or more effectively in a combined
form as a multi-domain attack, we show that it is possible to change the
semantics of the transferred information even when the reconstruction loss
remains low. These multi-domain adversarial attacks pose as a serious threat to
the semantics of information transfer (with larger impact than conventional
jamming) and raise the need of defense methods for the safe adoption of
semantic communications.

effectively classifying and filtering multilingual, heterogeneous and noisy

the pre-training corpora of large language models, is the removal of adult and
harmful content. In this paper we explore different methods for detecting adult
and harmful of content in multilingual heterogeneous web data. We first show
how traditional methods in harmful content detection, that seemingly perform
quite well in small and specialized datasets quickly break down when confronted
with heterogeneous noisy web data. We then resort to using a perplexity based
approach but with a twist: Instead of using a so-called ""clean"" corpus to train
a small language model and then use perplexity so select the documents with low
perplexity, i.e., the documents that resemble this so-called ""clean"" corpus the
most. We train solely with adult and harmful textual data, and then select the
documents having a perplexity value above a given threshold. This approach will
virtually cluster our documents into two distinct groups, which will greatly
facilitate the choice of the threshold for the perplexity and will also allow
us to obtain higher precision than with the traditional classification methods

  Retrieval with Adapters","15 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  A popular approach to creating a zero-shot cross-language retrieval model is
to substitute a monolingual pretrained language model in the retrieval model
with a multilingual pretrained language model such as Multilingual BERT. This
multilingual model is fined-tuned to the retrieval task with monolingual data
such as English MS MARCO using the same training recipe as the monolingual
retrieval model used. However, such transferred models suffer from mismatches
in the languages of the input text during training and inference. In this work,
we propose transferring monolingual retrieval models using adapters, a
parameter-efficient component for a transformer network. By adding adapters
pretrained on language tasks for a specific language with task-specific
adapters, prior work has shown that the adapter-enhanced models perform better
than fine-tuning the entire model when transferring across languages in various
NLP tasks. By constructing dense retrieval models with adapters, we show that
models trained with monolingual data are more effective than fine-tuning the
entire model when transferring to a Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR)
setting. However, we found that the prior suggestion of replacing the language
adapters to match the target language at inference time is suboptimal for dense
retrieval models. We provide an in-depth analysis of this discrepancy between
other cross-language NLP tasks and CLIR.

topic. It can extract significant and interesting information from specific and
varied databases, increasing the value of the services provided. In practice,
the measure of utility is often used to demonstrate the importance, profit, or
risk of an object or a pattern. In the database, although utility is a flexible
criterion for each pattern, it is a more absolute criterion due to the neglect
of utility sharing. This leads to the derived patterns only exploring partial
and local knowledge from a database. Utility occupancy is a recently proposed
model that considers the problem of mining with high utility but low occupancy.
However, existing studies are concentrated on itemsets that do not reveal the
temporal relationship of object occurrences. Therefore, this paper towards
sequence utility maximization. We first define utility occupancy on sequence
data and raise the problem of High Utility-Occupancy Sequential Pattern Mining
(HUOSPM). Three dimensions, including frequency, utility, and occupancy, are
comprehensively evaluated in HUOSPM. An algorithm called Sequence Utility
Maximization with Utility occupancy measure (SUMU) is proposed. Furthermore,
two data structures for storing related information about a pattern,
Utility-Occupancy-List-Chain (UOL-Chain) and Utility-Occupancy-Table (UO-Table)
with six associated upper bounds, are designed to improve efficiency. Empirical
experiments are carried out to evaluate the novel algorithm's efficiency and
effectiveness. The influence of different upper bounds and pruning strategies
is analyzed and discussed. The comprehensive results suggest that the work of
our algorithm is intelligent and effective.

themselves in the difficulties in obtaining gauge field propagators. For a
consistent quantization, it is necessary to eliminate non-physical gauge
degrees of freedom. The standard procedure is to break the gauge symmetry by
applying a gauge condition. In this work, we introduced a new generalized gauge
condition $W_{\mu} A^{a\mu}=0$, where $W_{\mu}=\lambda \partial_{\mu}+\beta

study the plastic strain rate, $\frac{d\epsilon}{d\gamma}$, (where $\gamma$ is
the applied strain and $\epsilon$ is the plastic strain) during the terminal
limit cycles and show that it consists of a creeping regime at low $\gamma$
with very low $\frac{d\epsilon}{d\gamma}$ followed by a sharp transition at a
characteristic strain, $\gamma_*$, and stress, $\sigma_*$, to a flowing regime
with higher $\frac{d\epsilon}{d\gamma}$. We show that while increasing $\Gamma$
above $\Gamma_0$ results in lower terminal ground state energy,
$U_{\text{min}}$, and a correspondingly narrower distribution of stresses, it,
surprisingly, results in lower $\gamma_*$, and $\sigma_*$. The stress
distribution, $P(\sigma)$, also becomes skewed for $\Gamma>\Gamma_0$. That is,
the systems in the RPR are anomalously soft and mechanically polarized. We
relate this to an emergent characteristic feature in the stress distribution,
$P(\sigma)$, at a value, $\sigma_0$, which is independent of $\Gamma$ and show
that $\sigma_0$ implies a relation between the $\Gamma$ dependence of
$\sigma_*$, $\gamma_*$, and the amplitude of plastic strain, $\epsilon_p$. We
show that the onset of hysteresis is characterized by a power-law scaling,
indicative of a second order transition with $\epsilon_p\propto
(\Gamma-\Gamma_0)^{1.2\pm0.1}$. We argue that $\sigma_0$ and, correspondingly,
the onset of the RPR at $\Gamma=\Gamma_0$, is simply set by the so-called
Eshelby-stress. Furthermore, we show that cycling at $\Gamma_0$ results in a
maximally hardened state.

  figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.med-ph q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The properties of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) walls are known to be driven
by the underlying hemodynamics adjacent to the IA sac. Different pathways exist
explaining the connections between hemodynamics and local tissue properties.
The emergence of such theories is essential if one wishes to compute the
mechanical response of a patient-specific IA wall and predict its rupture.
Apart from the hemodynamics and tissue properties, one could assume that the
mechanical response also depends on the local morphology, more specifically,
the wall curvature, with larger values at highly-curved wall portions.
Nonetheless, this contradicts observations of IA rupture sites more often found
at the dome, where the curvature is lower. This seeming contradiction indicates
a complex interaction between local hemodynamics, wall morphology, and
mechanical response, which warrants further investigation. This was the main
goal of this work. We accomplished this by analysing the stress and stretch
fields in different regions of the wall for a sample of IAs, which have been
classified based on particular local hemodynamics and local curvature.
Pulsatile numerical simulations were performed using the one-way fluid-solid
interaction strategy implemented in OpenFOAM (solids4foam toolbox). We found
that the variable best correlated with regions of high stress and stretch was
the wall curvature. Additionally, our data suggest a connection between the
local curvature and local hemodynamics, indicating that the curvature is a
property that could be used to assess both mechanical response and hemodynamic
conditions, and, moreover, to suggest new metrics based on the curvature to
predict the likelihood of rupture.

to the surface geometry, which in turn leads to alterations in the distribution
of parameters across the surface including surface gravity, temperature and
ionization balance of surface elements. Often, these 3D effects are neglected
when analyzing spectra of rapidly rotating massive stars. We aim to determine
whether neglecting the 3D deformations resulting from rapid rotation has an
impact on the final spectroscopic observables, and if so to what degree. Using
the SPAMMS code, we generate a grid of synthetic spectra that account for the
3D geometry of rapidly rotating stars and compare them to synthetic spectra
generated assuming spherical geometry. Using equivalent width and full width
half maximum measurements as proxies, we determine how the measured
temperature, helium abundance and projected rotation rates of individual lines
in different ionization states vary with rotation rate and inclination. We find
that the 3D geometry can have a significant impact on the measured parameters.
We show that the temperature is highly dependent on both the rotation rate and
the inclination, and that the same system viewed at different inclinations can
have measured temperatures that differ by as much as 10\%. We also find that
the helium abundance can be underestimated by as much as 60\%, and that lines
in different ionization states can have measurable differences in rotation
rates. We demonstrate that these differences in rotation rates can be seen in
observed data and show that this could allow for an inclination independent
measurement of the rotational velocity. Our results indicate that neglecting
the 3D effects of rotation can cause significant biases in the measured
spectroscopic parameters, and that in many cases, the measured values are more
than 3$\sigma$ away from the true values.

conservative and dissipative scattering observables using the post-Minkowskian
approach to gravitational dynamics. However, for accurate modeling of unbound
orbits, an appropriate effective-one-body (EOB) resummation of the
post-Minkowski results that also accounts for dissipative dynamics is
desirable. As a step in this direction, we consider the electromagnetic analog
of this problem here. We show that a six-parameter equation of motion
encapsulates the effective-one-body dynamics for the electromagnetic scattering
problem appropriate to third-order in the coupling constant. Three of these six
parameters describe the conservative part of the dynamics, while the rest
correspond to the radiation-reaction effects. Here we show that only two
radiation-reaction-related parameters are important at the desired order,
making the effective number of parameters in our formalism to be five. We
compute the explicit forms of these five parameters by matching EOB scattering
observables to that of the original two-body ones computed by [Saketh et al.,
Phys.Rev.Res. 4 (2022) 1]. Interestingly, our formalism leads to a conjecture
for the sub-leading angular momentum loss, for which no precise computations
exist. In addition, we demonstrate that the bound-orbit observables computed
using our method are in perfect agreement with those calculated using
unbound-to-bound analytical continuation techniques. Lastly, we qualitatively
discuss the extension of our formalism to gravity.

with a very thin magnetic flux running along the core of the idealized cosmic
string, and with a magnetic flux enclosed by the compact dimension. These
observables are expressed as the vacuum expectation values and the finite
temperature contributions coming from the particles and antiparticles

decomposed in a part induced by the cosmic string spacetime without
compactification, plus a contribution induced by the compactification. This
decompositions explicitly follows from the Abel-Plana formula used to proceed
the summation over the discrete quantum number associated with the
quasiperiodic condition imposed on the quantum field along the compact
dimension. The expectations values of the field squared and the energy-momentum

languages, it remains difficult to create effective fully zero-shot dense
retrieval systems when no relevance label is available. In this paper, we
recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead,
we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings~(HyDE). Given a
query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model
(e.g. InstructGPT) to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures
relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an
unsupervised contrastively learned encoder~(e.g. Contriever) encodes the
document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the
corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on
vector similarity. This second step ground the generated document to the actual
corpus, with the encoder's dense bottleneck filtering out the incorrect
details. Our experiments show that HyDE significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retriever Contriever and shows strong
performance comparable to fine-tuned retrievers, across various tasks (e.g. web

New language-specific embeddings can then be efficiently trained over the

transfer. We explore two approaches to learn mini-models: MiniJoint, which
jointly pretrains the primary model and the mini-model using a single
transformer with a secondary MLM head at a middle layer; and MiniPost, where we
start from a regular pretrained model and build a mini-model by extracting and
freezing a few layers and learning a small number of parameters on top.
Experiments on XNLI, MLQA and PAWS-X show that mini-model adaptation matches
the performance of the standard approach using up to 2.4x less compute.

Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior

complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution
to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language
reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over
the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module,
named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized
table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained
large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of
LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing
unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task.
DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play
fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than >28k data points,
DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over
finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.

relationships for its fundamental and first overtone. In contrast to
relationships proposed in the literature, our universal relationships are
capable of including slow stable hybrid stars that appear when considering slow
sharp hadron-quark phase transitions. We show that, if the frequency and
damping time of the fundamental mode of a given pulsating object are measured,
its mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability can be inferred.
Moreover, we show that the errors of such estimates are smaller than a few
percent for the mass and radius. For the dimensionless tidal deformability, the
errors are -- for compact objects with $M\gtrsim 1.4\,M_\odot$ -- in general
smaller than ~100%. Comparison with previous universal relationships shows that
the ones proposed in this work produce better estimates of the mass and radius
of totally stable compact objects.

exhibit natural chat capabilities with humans. In this research, we examine
user utterances as causes and generated responses as effects, recognizing that
changes in a cause should produce a different effect. To further explore this
concept, we have compiled and expanded upon a new dataset called CausalDialogue
through crowd-sourcing. This dataset includes multiple cause-effect pairs
within a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Our analysis reveals that
traditional loss functions can struggle to effectively incorporate the DAG
structure, leading us to propose a causality-enhanced method called Exponential
Maximum Average Treatment Effect (ExMATE) to enhance the impact of causality at
the utterance level in training neural conversation models. To evaluate the
effectiveness of this approach, we have built a comprehensive benchmark using
the CausalDialogue dataset leveraging large-scale pre-trained language models,
and have assessed the results through both human and automatic evaluation
metrics for coherence, diversity, and agility. Our findings show that current
techniques are still unable to effectively address conversational DAGs, and
that the ExMATE method can improve the diversity and agility of conventional
loss functions while maintaining coherence.

widefield interferometric defocus-enhanced mid-infrared photothermal (WIDE-MIP)
microscopy for high-throughput fingerprinting of single viruses. A theoretical
framework for interferometric defocus-enhanced photothermal signal is developed
and experimentally validated, providing a guideline to obtain a well-defined
photothermal detection signal by adjusting the defocusing. Compared to scanning
MIP, WIDE-MIP increases the imaging throughput by 3 orders of magnitude for
fingerprint analysis of bio-nanoparticles at the same signal to noise ratio.
Fingerprint detection of DNA vaccinia viruses (VACV) and RNA vesicular
stomatitis viruses (VSV) is demonstrated. The consistent amide I and amide II
vibrational contrasts from viral proteins are shown in both virions, while
specific thymine and uracil residue vibrations are observed in VACV and VSV,
respectively, indicating unique IR signatures of different nuclei acids.
WIDE-MIP further identifies the protein secondary structure in DNA
varicella-zoster virus by revealing enriched beta sheet components. Capable of
fingerprinting unlabeled viral particles, WIDE-MIP microscopy is a valuable

in the speech research community, but have not received as much attention as
lower-level tasks like speech and speaker recognition. In particular, there are
not nearly as many SLU task benchmarks, and many of the existing ones use data
that is not freely available to all researchers. Recent work has begun to
introduce such benchmark datasets for several tasks. In this work, we introduce
several new annotated SLU benchmark tasks based on freely available speech
data, which complement existing benchmarks and address gaps in the SLU
evaluation landscape. We contribute four tasks: question answering and
summarization involve inference over longer speech sequences; named entity
localization addresses the speech-specific task of locating the targeted
content in the signal; dialog act classification identifies the function of a
given speech utterance. We follow the blueprint of the Spoken Language
Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) benchmark suite. In order to facilitate the
development of SLU models that leverage the success of pre-trained speech
representations, we will be publishing for each task (i) annotations for a
relatively small fine-tuning set, (ii) annotated development and test sets, and
(iii) baseline models for easy reproducibility and comparisons. In this work,
we present the details of data collection and annotation and the performance of
the baseline models. We also perform sensitivity analysis of pipeline models'

(1) state-of-the-art summarizers suffer large reductions in performance when
applied to the open-domain, even when retrieval performance is high, (2)
additional training in the open-domain setting can reduce this sensitivity to
imperfect retrieval, and (3) summarizers are insensitive to the retrieval of
duplicate documents and the order of retrieved documents, but highly sensitive
to other errors, like the retrieval of irrelevant documents. Based on our
results, we provide practical guidelines to enable future work on open-domain
MDS, e.g. how to choose the number of retrieved documents to summarize. Our

annotated resources for training and evaluation, will be necessary for further

Therefore, we constrain the cross section for dark matter annihilation into two

psychologically safe. We designed unbiased prompts to systematically evaluate
LLMs from a psychological perspective. First, we tested three different LLMs by
using two personality tests: Short Dark Triad (SD-3) and Big Five Inventory
(BFI). All models scored higher than the human average on SD-3, suggesting a
relatively darker personality pattern. Despite being instruction fine-tuned
with safety metrics to reduce toxicity, InstructGPT and FLAN-T5 still showed
implicit dark personality patterns; both models scored higher than
self-supervised GPT-3 on the Machiavellianism and narcissism traits on SD-3.
Then, we evaluated the LLMs in the GPT-3 series by using well-being tests to
study the impact of fine-tuning with more training data. We observed a
continuous increase in the well-being scores of GPT-3 and InstructGPT.
Following these observations, we showed that instruction fine-tuning FLAN-T5
with positive answers from BFI could effectively improve the model from a
psychological perspective. On the basis of the findings, we recommended the
application of more systematic and comprehensive psychological metrics to

compact, i.e. unresolved, with a de-lensed size upper-limit of
$r_{e}\lesssim35$ pc. The images have apparent magnitudes of

$L_{\mathrm{bol}}\sim10^{44}-10^{46} \frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}}$,

nucleus (AGN) at high redshift. We also discuss other alternative origins for
the object's emission features, including a massive star cluster, Population
III, supermassive, or dark stars, or a direct-collapse black hole. Although
populations of red galaxies at similar photometric redshifts have been detected
with JWST, this object is unique in that its high-redshift nature is
corroborated geometrically by lensing, that it is unresolved despite being
magnified -- and thus intrinsically even more compact -- and that it occupies
notably distinct regions in both size-luminosity and color-color space. Planned
UNCOVER JWST/NIRSpec observations, scheduled in Cycle 1, will enable a more
detailed analysis of this object.

  Green-Hydrogen Logistics",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hydrogen can be produced from water, using electricity. The hydrogen can
subsequently be kept in inventory in large quantities, unlike the electricity
itself. This enables solar and wind energy generation to occur asynchronously
from its usage. For this reason, hydrogen is expected to be a key ingredient
for reaching a climate-neutral economy. However, the logistics for hydrogen are
complex. Inventory policies must be determined for multiple locations in the
network, and transportation of hydrogen from the production location to
customers must be scheduled. At the same time, production patterns of hydrogen
are intermittent, which affects the possibilities to realize the planned
transportation and inventory levels. To provide policies for efficient
transportation and storage of hydrogen, this paper proposes a parameterized
cost function approximation approach to the stochastic cyclic inventory routing
problem. Firstly, our approach includes a parameterized mixed integer
programming (MIP) model which yields fixed and repetitive schedules for vehicle
transportation of hydrogen. Secondly, buying and selling decisions in case of
underproduction or overproduction are optimized further via a Markov decision
process (MDP) model, taking into account the uncertainties in production and
demand quantities. To jointly optimize the parameterized MIP and the MDP model,
our approach includes an algorithm that searches the parameter space by
iteratively solving the MIP and MDP models. We conduct computational
experiments to validate our model in various problem settings and show that it
provides near-optimal solutions. Moreover, we test our approach on an
expert-reviewed case study at two hydrogen production locations in the
Netherlands. We offer insights for the stakeholders in the region and analyze
the impact of various problem elements in these case studies.

visualization types, leading to variance in this ranking across individuals not
captured by population-level metrics using ""average observer"" models. One way
we can bridge this gap is by recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools
for assessing individual performance, in addition to overall visualization
performance. In this paper we replicate and extend Cleveland and McGill's
graphical comparison experiment using Bayesian multilevel regression, using
these models to explore individual differences in visualization skill from
multiple perspectives. The results from experiments and modeling indicate that
some people show patterns of accuracy that credibly deviate from the canonical
rankings of visualization effectiveness. We discuss implications of these
findings, such as a need for new ways to communicate visualization
effectiveness to designers, how patterns in individuals' responses may show
systematic biases and strategies in visualization judgment, and how recasting
classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance

the causal structure of tasks, enabling robust generalization. However,
high-quality counterfactual data is scarce for most tasks and not easily

and diversity; when generated using supervised methods, it is computationally
expensive to extend to new counterfactual dimensions. In this work, we
introduce DISCO (DIStilled COunterfactual Data), a new method for automatically
generating high quality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts
to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a
task-specific teacher model filters these generations to distill high-quality
counterfactual data. While task-agnostic, we apply our pipeline to the task of
natural language inference (NLI) and find that on challenging evaluations such
as the NLI stress test, comparatively smaller student models trained with DISCO
generated counterfactuals are more robust (6% absolute) and generalize better
across distributions (2%) compared to models trained without data augmentation.
Furthermore, DISCO augmented models are 10% more consistent between
counterfactual pairs on three evaluation sets, demonstrating that DISCO
augmentation enables models to more reliably learn causal representations. Our

researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those

\times U(1)_X \rightarrow SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \rightarrow
SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{EM}$, generating mass for all fermions, except neutrinos.
Tiny neutrino masses may be achieved by adding one sextet of scalars to the
original scalar content. As consequence, it emerges a very complex scalar
sector, involving terms that violate lepton number explicitly, too. The main
obstacle to the development of the phenomenology of such scenario is the
knowledge of its spectrum of scalars since, now, there are 15 massive scalar
particles on it. The proposal of this work is to do an exhaustive analysis of
such scalar sector with lepton number being explicitly violated at low,
electroweak and high energy scales by means of trilinear terms in the
potential. The first case can be addressed analytically and, as a nice result,
we have observed that the scalar content of such case is split into two
categories: One belonging to the 331 energy scale and the other belonging to
the EWSB energy scale, with the last recovering the well known THDM+triplet.
For the other cases, the scalar sector can be addressed only numerically.
Hence, we proposed a very general approach for the numerical study of the
potential, avoiding simplifications that can make us reach conclusions without
foundation. We show that, in the case of lepton number being explicitly
violated at electroweak scale, it is possible to recover the same physics of
the THDM+triplet, as the previous case. Among all the possibilities, we call
the attention to one special case which generates the 3HDM+triplet scenario.
For the last case, when lepton number is violated at high energy scale, the
sextet become very massive and decouples from the original scalar content of
the 3-3-1 model.

match directional semantic relations in text (e.g., ""mug in grass"") with
spatial relationships in the image (e.g., the position of the mug relative to
the grass). To tackle this problem, we show that relation alignment can be
enforced by encouraging the directed language attention from 'mug' to 'grass'
(capturing the semantic relation 'in') to match the directed visual attention
from the mug to the grass. Tokens and their corresponding objects are softly
identified using the cross-modal attention. We prove that this notion of soft
relation alignment is equivalent to enforcing congruence between vision and
language attention matrices under a 'change of basis' provided by the
cross-modal attention matrix. Intuitively, our approach projects visual
attention into the language attention space to calculate its divergence from
the actual language attention, and vice versa. We apply our Cross-modal

the model prediction to be consistent across two distinct dropouts to further
prevent overfitting on noisy labels. Our method can be applied to augmentation

in performance, its working mechanism still remains an open question. In this
paper, we explain language models as meta-optimizers and understand in-context
learning as implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that Transformer
attention has a dual form of gradient descent. On top of it, we understand ICL
as follows: GPT first produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration
examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to
build an ICL model. We comprehensively compare the behaviors of in-context
learning and explicit finetuning on real tasks to provide empirical evidence
that supports our understanding. Experimental results show that in-context
learning behaves similarly to explicit finetuning from multiple perspectives.
Inspired by the dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent,
we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with gradient descent with
momentum. The improved performance over vanilla attention further supports our
understanding from another perspective, and more importantly, shows the
potential to utilize our understanding for future model design. The code is

Type IIB brane setup that engineers the $3d$ theories, where mirror symmetry is
realized as $S$-duality, but it is enirely field-theoretic and based on the
application of genuine infra-red dualities that implement the local action of
$S$-duality on the quiver. In this paper, we generalize the algorithm to the
full duality group, which is $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ in $3d$ and $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
in $4d$. This also produces dualities for $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=3$ theories with
Chern--Simons couplings, some of which have enhanced $\mathcal{N}=4$
supersymmetry, and their new $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ counterpart. In addition, we
propose three ways to study the RG flows triggered by possible VEVs appearing
at the last step of the algorithm, one of which uses a new duality that
implements the Hanany--Witten move in field theory.

a constant reflection probability of longitudinal -- but not transverse --

expanding vacuum bubbles in the early Universe. Most notably, it leads to a new
source of pressure on the expanding interface, featuring a non-monotonic
dependence on the $\gamma$-factor of the bubble walls and reaching a peak at
intermediate $\gamma$-factors that we dub Maximum Dynamic Pressure. When this
pressure is large enough to halt the acceleration of the bubble walls, the
difference in vacuum energy densities goes into making a fraction of the dark
photons relativistic, turning them into dark radiation. If the dark radiation
remains relativistic until late times, an observable contribution to $\Delta
N_\text{eff}$ is possible for phase transitions with strength $\alpha \sim
10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$.

We report correlation strengths, intensity ratios, and power law fits relating
emission in JWST's F770W, F1000W, F1130W, and F2100W bands to CO and H$\alpha$.
At these scales, CO and H$\alpha$ each correlate strongly with mid-IR emission,
and these correlations are each stronger than the one relating CO to H$\alpha$
emission. This reflects that mid-IR emission simultaneously acts as a dust
column density tracer, leading to the good match with the molecular gas-tracing
CO, and as a heating tracer, leading to the good match with the H$\alpha$. By
combining mid-IR, CO, and H$\alpha$ at scales where the overall correlation
between cold gas and star formation begins to break down, we are able to
separate these two effects. We model the mid-IR above $I_\nu = 0.5$~MJy
sr$^{-1}$ at F770W, a cut designed to select regions where the molecular gas
dominates the interstellar medium (ISM) mass. This bright emission can be
described to first order by a model that combines a CO-tracing component and an
H$\alpha$-tracing component. The best-fitting models imply that $\sim 50\%$ of
the mid-IR flux arises from molecular gas heated by the diffuse interstellar
radiation field, with the remaining $\sim 50\%$ associated with bright, dusty
star forming regions. We discuss differences between the F770W, F1000W, F1130W

of the theory corresponds to fully thermalized dark matter halos. As a result
the entire halo undergoes Bose-Einstein condensation due to high degeneracy.
Since it is observationally preferable for the dark matter density profile to
be similar to cold dark matter in the outskirts of the halo, we argue that the
Jeans wavelength must be at least few times shorter than the virial radius.
This entails that, upon condensation, a dark matter halo fragments into
superfluid clumps. However, we demonstrate that these would-be solitons
experience strong tidal disruption and behave as virialized weakly interacting
streams. An exception is the central soliton, which can be as large as few tens
of kiloparsecs in size without contradicting observational bounds. As a result,
in dwarf galaxies, the observed rotation curves can be completely contained
within the superfluid soliton. In this case, the dark matter distribution is
expected to be strongly sensitive to the baryonic density profile. We argue
that the diversity of rotation curves observed for dwarf galaxies is a natural
consequence of the superfluid dark matter scenario.

total energy associated with the shocks is $\sim6\times10^{61}$ erg, with the
central AGN driving a pair of weak shocks every 20-30 Myr with a power
$P_{sh}\approx10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Based on its morphology and age ($\sim$30
Myr), the inner cocoon shock is associated with the four equidistant X-ray
cavities previously discovered. From the thermodynamic analysis of the inner 30
kpc, we find evidence for ICM condensation into colder gas between and behind
the X-ray cavities. The total AGN mechanical power (cavities and shocks) of
$3.4\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can balance the ICM radiative losses, estimated
as $L_{cool} = 2.3\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. By building plots of $P_{cav}$

are found in the strongest cooling systems. Ultimately, we observe that the
mechanical power of the AGN exceeds the gas radiative losses by a factor that
is different for FR I and FR II radio galaxies, being less than a few tens for
FR Is (as RBS 797) and more than roughly a hundred for FR IIs.

kinematics. The star formation rate (SFR) surface density presents a clumpy
distribution, with the brightest knot hosting a 5 Myr young, Wolf-Rayet (WR)
population (revealed by the presence of the characteristic 5808\AA~WR bump).
The ionised gas kinematics are dominated by disordered motions. A superposition
of a narrow ($\sigma \approx$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), intermediate (150 km s$^{-1}$)
and broad (1000 km s$^{-1}$) kinematic components are needed to model the
emission line profiles in the brightest SF region, suggesting the presence of
energetic outflows from massive stars. The gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy
spans 0.6 dex and displays a strong anti-correlation with SFR surface density,
dropping to 12+log(O/H) = 7.7 in the central SF knot. The spatially-resolved
BPTs indicates the gas is being ionised purely by SF processes. Finally, the
anti-correlation between the SFR and the gas metallicity points out to
accretion of metal-poor gas as the origin of the recent off-centre starburst,
in which the infalling material ignites the SF episode.

considerable attention in recent years, primarily motivated by strategies to

originates from scalar spin chirality, is an example of inter-band quantum
coherence induced by real-space inhomogeneous magnetic textures, and its
magnitude depends on the winding number and chiral spin features that establish
the total topological charge of the system. Remarkably, in the two decades
since its discovery, there has been no research on the quantum correction to
the topological Hall effect. Here we will show that, unlike the ordinary Hall
effect, the inhomogeneous magnetization arising from the spin texture will give
additional scattering terms in the kinetic equation, which result in a quantum
correction to the topological Hall resistivity. We focus on 2D systems, where
weak localization is strongest, and determine the complicated gradient
corrections to the Cooperon and kinetic equation. Whereas the weak localization
correction to the topological Hall effect is not large in currently known

bands, obtained with VLT/FORS2. Circinus is the closest Seyfert 2 galaxy and
harbours an archetypal obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). Recent high
angular resolution imaging revealed that a major fraction of its mid-infrared
(MIR) emission is coming from the polar region. Previously, we demonstrated
that these observations are consistent with a model of a compact dusty disc and
a hyperboloid shell, resembling a hollow cone on larger scales. Here we focus
on the AGN core, up to 40 pc from the central engine, and compare the
observations to the radiative transfer models. Polarization maps reveal a
conical structure, coinciding with the ionization cone. The
wavelength-dependence of the polarization degree indicates that scattering on
dust grains is producing polarization. The observed polarization degree
($\approx1-3\%$) is lower than predicted by the models; however, this is only a
lower limit, since stellar emission dominates the total flux in the optical.
The observed polarization angle ($\approx30$ degrees) is reproduced by the
model of a dusty disc with a hollow cone that is illuminated by a tilted
anisotropic central source. An accretion disc aligned with the ionization cone
axis, and alternative dust geometries, such as a paraboloid shell, or a torus
enveloped by ambient dust, are inconsistent with the data. We conclude that the
optical polarimetric imaging supports earlier evidence for the presence of dust
in the polar region, tentatively associated with dusty outflows.

limited to 484 voxels with good detection of the
$[SIII]$6312$\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$ temperature diagnostic line. The
recombination fluxes are corrected for stellar absorption via a population
synthesis. Additionally, we discuss a new algorithm to fit photoionization
models via neural networks. The 8 ionic abundances analyzed show a spatial
normal distribution with a $\sigma\sim0.1\,dex$, where only half this value can
be explained by the uncertainty in the measurements. The oxygen abundance
distribution is $12+log(O/H)=7.88\pm0.11$. The $T_{e}[SIII]$ and $ne[SII]$ are
also normally distributed. However, in the central and brightest region, the
$ne[SII]$ is almost thrice the mean galaxy value. This is also reflected in the
extinction measurements. The ionization parameter has a distribution of $log(U)
= -2.52^{0.17}_{0.19}$. The parameter spatial behaviour agrees with the
$S^{2+}/S^{+}$ map. Finally, the discrepancies between the direct method and
the photoionization model fitting are discussed. In the latter technique, we
find that mixing lines with uneven uncertainty magnitudes can impact the

characteristics reflect the interaction of galaxies with the environment.
However, it is not clear the degree of influence of the large-scale structure
on the properties of void galaxies or, if these are only influenced by the low
local density around them typical of these regions. In this article we
identified cosmic voids in the SDSS-DR16 and studied various properties of
galaxies, such as g-r colour, star formation rate, and concentration. To
characterise the local environment, we have identified groups of galaxies and
studied their properties as a function of their dark matter and stellar masses,
analysing separately those found in voids and in the general sample. Our
results show that galaxies that inhabit haloes of a given mass (below \sim
10^13.5 M_\dot ), are bluer, have a higher star formation rate and are less
concentrated when the host halo is inside voids compared to other regions. For
larger halo masses, the trend disappears. We also analyse whether the
properties of galaxies are sensitive to the type of voids that inhabit. This is
done by separating voids embedded in overdense regions (S-type) from those that
asymptotically converge to the average density of the universe (R-type). We
found that galaxies in R-type voids are bluer, with higher SFR and less
concentration than in S-type voids. Our results indicate some degree of
correlation of galaxy properties with the large-scale environment provided by
voids, suggesting possible second-order mechanisms in galaxy evolution.

We find that recently coalesced 'post-mergers' in all three simulations have
elevated SMBH accretion rates by factors of ~2-5. However, rapid (within 500
Myr of coalescence) quenching of star formation is rare, with incidence rates
of 0.4% in Illustris, 4.5% in EAGLE and 10% in IllustrisTNG. The rarity of
quenching in post-mergers results from substantial gas reservoirs that remain
intact after the merger. The post-mergers that do successfully quench tend to
be those that had both low pre-merger gas fractions as well as those that
experience the largest gas losses. Although rare, the recently quenched
fraction of post-mergers is still elevated compared to a control sample of
non-mergers by factors of two in IllustrisTNG and 11 in EAGLE. Conversely,
quenching is rarer in Illustris post-mergers than in their control. Recent
observational results by Ellison et al. have found rapid quenching to be at
least 30 times more common in post-mergers, a significantly higher excess than
found in any of the simulations. Our results, therefore, indicate that whilst
merger-induced SMBH accretion is a widespread prediction of the simulations,
its link to quenching depends sensitively on the physics models, and that none
of the subgrid models of the simulations studied here can fully capture the

causal diamonds is recovered from a boundary term in the on-shell Euclidean
action. In contrast, with a positive cosmological constant, as well as in
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with or without a cosmological constant, an exact
saddle exists with a finite boundary temperature, but in these cases the causal
diamond is determined by the saddle rather than being selected a priori.

kinetic (Ek), and magnetic (Em) energies of structures within a hub-filament
system in a simulation of the formation and global hierarchical collapse (GHC)
of a giant molecular cloud. For structures defined by various density
thresholds, and at different evolutionary stages, we investigate the scaling of
the virial parameter, $\alpha$, with mass $M$, and of the Larson ratio,
${\cal{L}}\equiv\sigma_v/R^{1/2}$, with column density $\Sigma$, where
$\sigma_v$ is the 1D velocity dispersion, and $R$ is an effective radius. We
also investigate these scalings for the corresponding magnetic parameters
$\alpha_m$ and ${\cal{L}}_m$. Finally, we compare our numerical results with an
observational sample of massive clumps. We find that: 1) $\alpha_m$ and
${\cal{L}}_m$ follow similar scalings as their kinetic counterparts, although
the ratio Em/Ek decreases as |Eg| increases. 2) The largest objects, defined by
the lowest thresholds, tend to appear gravitationally bound (and magnetically
supercritical), while their internal substructures tend to appear unbound (and
subcritical). This suggests that the latter are being compressed by the infall
of their parent structures, and supports earlier suggestions that the measured
mass-to-magnetic flux ratio $\mu$ decreases inwards in a centrally-peaked cloud
under ideal MHD. 3)~The scatter in the $\alpha$-$M$ and ${\cal{L}}$-$\Sigma$
plots is reduced when Ek and Em are plotted directly against Eg, suggesting
that the scatter is due to an ambiguity between mass and size. 4) The clumps in
our GHC simulation follow the same trends as the observational sample of
massive clumps in the $\alpha$-$M$ and ${\cal{L}}$-$\Sigma$ diagrams. We
conclude that the main controlling parameter of the energy budget in the
structures is Eg, with the kinetic and magnetic energies being derived from it.

the massive collection of annotated data which is expensive and time-consuming.
To lower the cost of data annotation, active learning has been proposed to
interactively query an oracle to annotate a small proportion of informative
samples in an unlabeled dataset. Inspired by the fact that the samples with
higher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with
lower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learning approach that
queries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to
incorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement Temporal
Output Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the
discrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our
theoretical investigation shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample
loss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled samples. On basis of
TOD, we further develop an effective unlabeled data sampling strategy as well
as an unsupervised learning criterion for active learning. Due to the
simplicity of TOD, our methods are efficient, flexible, and task-agnostic.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
performances than the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image
classification and semantic segmentation tasks. In addition, we show that TOD
can be utilized to select the best model of potentially the highest testing

property prediction, where graph neural networks (GNNs) serve as an effective
solution due to their structure modeling capabilities. Since labeled data is
often scarce and expensive to obtain, it is a great challenge for GNNs to
generalize in the extensive molecular space. Recently, the training paradigm of
""pre-train, fine-tune"" has been leveraged to improve the generalization
capabilities of GNNs. It uses self-supervised information to pre-train the GNN,
and then performs fine-tuning to optimize the downstream task with just a few
labels. However, pre-training does not always yield statistically significant
improvement, especially for self-supervised learning with random structural
masking. In fact, the molecular structure is characterized by motif subgraphs,
which are frequently occurring and influence molecular properties. To leverage
the task-related motifs, we propose a novel paradigm of ""pre-train, prompt,
fine-tune"" for molecular representation learning, named molecule continuous
prompt tuning (MolCPT). MolCPT defines a motif prompting function that uses the
pre-trained model to project the standalone input into an expressive prompt.
The prompt effectively augments the molecular graph with meaningful motifs in
the continuous representation space; this provides more structural patterns to
aid the downstream classifier in identifying molecular properties. Extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets show that MolCPT efficiently
generalizes pre-trained GNNs for molecular property prediction, with or without
a few fine-tuning steps.

Modelling these features in a self-consistent manner is crucial for
understanding the dynamics of Saturn's interior and atmosphere. Here we report
a turbulent high-resolution dynamo simulation in a spherical shell which
produces these features simultaneously for the first time. A crucial model
ingredient is a long-hypothesised stably stratified layer (SSL), sandwiched
between a deep metallic hydrogen layer and an outer low-conductivity molecular
layer, born out of limited solubility of Helium inside metallic Hydrogen at
certain depths. The model spontaneously produces polar cyclones and significant
low and mid latitude jet stream activities in the molecular layer. The
off-equatorial low-latitude jet streams partially penetrate into the SSL and
interact with the magnetic field. This helps to axisymmetrize the magnetic
field about the rotation axis and convert some of the poloidal magnetic field
to toroidal field, which appears as two global magnetic energy rings
surrounding the deeper dynamo region. The simulation also mimics a distinctive
dip in the fifth spherical harmonic in Saturn's magnetic energy spectrum as
inferred from the Cassini Grand Finale measurements. Our model highlights the
role of an SSL in shaping the fluid dynamical and magnetic features of giant

cyclonic flows centered on the active latitudes with slower flows on the
poleward sides of the active latitudes and faster flows equatorward. The fast
flow band starts at $\sim$45$^\circ$ latitude during the declining phase of the
previous cycle and drifts equatorward, terminating at the equator at about the
time of cycle minimum. Variations in the differential rotation also include a
polar oscillation above 45$^\circ$ with faster rotation at cycle maxima and
slower rotation at cycle minima. The equatorial variations were stronger in
cycle 24 than in cycle 23 but the polar variations were weaker. Variations in
the meridional flow include a slowing of the poleward flow in the active
latitudes during cycle rise and maximum and a speeding up of the poleward flow

experimental and theoretical work, the disclination core is defined to be the
line where the uniaxial and biaxial order parameters are equal, or
equivalently, where the two largest eigenvalues of $\mathbf{Q}$ cross. This
allows an exact expression relating the velocity of the line to spatial and
temporal derivatives of $\mathbf{Q}$ on the line, to be specified by a

find that a pair of well-separated regions can become entangled in a time scale

sublinear in system size. To quantify the information dynamics, we develop a
formalism generalizing operator spreading to non-unitary dynamics, which is of
independent interest.

comparing the full Reynolds stress, which includes the contribution of
nonaxisymmetric features, such as spiral arms and vortices, to the Reynolds
stress due to the azimuthally averaged velocity field, which can be attributed
to good approximation to the VSI. We verified that the VSI can contribute to
the accretion stress and showed that, depending on disk conditions, an embedded
planet can coexist with or suppress VSI turbulent stress. Specifically, the
presence of spiral shocks launched by a planet or planet-generated vortices can
interfere with the VSI near the planet's vicinity, with the instability
recovering at large enough distances from the planet or vortex. Our results

coloring problems in the streaming model. The initial algorithms in this line
of work are all crucially randomized, raising natural questions about how
important a role randomization plays in streaming graph coloring. A couple of
very recent works have made progress on this question: they prove that
deterministic or even adversarially robust coloring algorithms (that work on
streams whose updates may depend on the algorithm's past outputs) are
considerably weaker than standard randomized ones. However, there is still a
significant gap between the upper and lower bounds for the number of colors
needed (as a function of the maximum degree $\Delta$) for robust coloring and
multipass deterministic coloring. We contribute to this line of work by proving
the following results.
  In the deterministic semi-streaming (i.e., $O(n \cdot \text{polylog } n)$
space) regime, we present an algorithm that achieves a combinatorially optimal
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring using $O(\log{\Delta} \log\log{\Delta})$ passes. This
improves upon the prior $O(\Delta)$-coloring algorithm of Assadi, Chen, and Sun
(STOC 2022) at the cost of only an $O(\log\log{\Delta})$ factor in the number
of passes.
  In the adversarially robust semi-streaming regime, we design an
$O(\Delta^{5/2})$-coloring algorithm that improves upon the previously best
$O(\Delta^{3})$-coloring algorithm of Chakrabarti, Ghosh, and Stoeckl (ITCS
2022). Further, we obtain a smooth colors/space tradeoff that improves upon
another algorithm of the said work: whereas their algorithm uses $O(\Delta^2)$
colors and $O(n\Delta^{1/2})$ space, ours, in particular, achieves
(i)~$O(\Delta^2)$ colors in $O(n\Delta^{1/3})$ space, and

scales as $\Theta\left(\min(B,N)\right)$. The coherent channel capacity scaling
can be fully achieved in non-coherent channels when $L\geq\Theta(N)$. In
summary, the channel coherence block length plays a pivotal role in modulation
selection and the capacity gap between coherent and non-coherent channels.
Pilot-Assisted signaling outperforms Energy Modulation's rate scaling versus
coherence block length. Only in high mobility scenarios where $L$ is much
smaller than the number of antennas ($L\ll\Theta(\sqrt{N})$), Energy Modulation
is effective in non-coherent channels.

optimal control problems governed by parametric partial differential equations.
With varying boundary control, we mean that a specific parameter changes where
the boundary control acts on the system. This peculiar formulation might
benefit from model order reduction. Indeed, fast and reliable simulations of
this model can be of utmost usefulness in many applied fields, such as
geophysics and energy engineering. However, varying boundary control features
very complicated and diversified parametric behaviour for the state and adjoint
variables. The state solution, for example, changing the boundary control
parameter, might feature transport phenomena. Moreover, the problem loses its
affine structure. It is well known that classical model order reduction
techniques fail in this setting, both in accuracy and in efficiency. Thus, we
propose reduced approaches inspired by the ones used when dealing with
wave-like phenomena. Indeed, we compare standard proper orthogonal
decomposition with two tailored strategies: geometric recasting and local
proper orthogonal decomposition. Geometric recasting solves the optimization
system in a reference domain simplifying the problem at hand avoiding
hyper-reduction, while local proper orthogonal decomposition builds local bases
to increase the accuracy of the reduced solution in very general settings
(where geometric recasting is unfeasible). We compare the various approaches on
two different numerical experiments based on geometries of increasing

viewpoint using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which seeks to find the

that there is suitable data to infer frequency. In data-starved experiments,
this may or may not be a feasible assumption. Moreover, MLE returns no error

Alternatively, Bayesian methods can return a solution with error estimates

computational methods with appropriately chosen step sizes in a somewhat

deterrent from using Bayesian methods despite the advantages. Probabilistic

these fluctuations, the TMD becomes a hypergeometric confluent function that
adequately reproduces the characteristic scales at low and high $p_T$ values.
In this approach, the hard scale of the TMD is a consequence of considering a
heavy-tailed distribution for the string tension fluctuations whose width rises
as $\sqrt{s}$, multiplicity or centrality increases. In this paper, we
introduce the complete information of the TMD in the color string percolation
model by means of the determination of the color suppression factor, which now
also depends on the parameters of the $q$-Gaussian. To this end, we analyze the
reported data on pp and AA collisions at different center of mass energies,
multiplicities, and centralities. In particular, for minimum bias pp
collisions, we found that the $q$-Gaussian parameters and the effective
temperature are monotonically increasing functions of the center of mass
energy. Similar results are found for AA collisions as a function of the
centrality at fixed $\sqrt{s}$.
  We summarize these results in a phase diagram that indicates the $q$-Gaussian

we use a sample of low redshift (0.02<z<0.055) galaxies from SDSS to
investigate the nature of the scatter around the MZR, the observables and
physical processes causing it, and its dependence on galaxy mass. We use cold
gas masses inferred from optical emission lines using the technique of Scholte
& Saintonge (2023) to confirm that at fixed stellar mass, metallicity and gas
mass are anti-correlated, but only for galaxies up to M*=10^10.5Msun. In that
mass regime, we find a link between the offset of a galaxy from the MZR and
halo mass, using the amplitude of the two-point correlation function as a proxy
for halo mass; at fixed stellar mass, the most gas-poor galaxies reside in the
most massive halos. This observation can be explained via changes in gas
accretion rates onto galaxies as a function of halo mass, as predicted by
simulations. At higher stellar masses, the scatter of the MZR correlates only
very weakly with gas mass and halo mass, but a stronger trend is found with AGN
activity. These results confirm expectations from models and simulations that
metallicity is set by the interplay between gas in- and outflows, star

few-shot learning ability from large models to smaller models. We propose to
combine in-context learning objectives with language modeling objectives to
distill both the ability to read in-context examples and task knowledge to the
smaller models. We perform in-context learning distillation under two different
few-shot learning paradigms: Meta In-context Tuning (Meta-ICT) and Multitask
In-context Tuning (Multitask-ICT). Multitask-ICT performs better on multitask
few-shot learning but also requires more computation than Meta-ICT. Our method
shows consistent improvements for both Meta-ICT and Multitask-ICT on two
benchmarks: LAMA and CrossFit. Our extensive experiments and analysis reveal
that in-context learning objectives and language modeling objectives are
complementary under the Multitask-ICT paradigm. In-context learning objectives
achieve the best performance when combined with language modeling objectives.

approaches developed for perceptual quality assessment and improvement over the
past two decades. In the determination of perceptual quality, different
spatio-temporal regions of the video differ in their relative importance to the
human viewer. However, since it is challenging to infer or even collect such
fine-grained information, it is often not used during compression beyond
low-level heuristics. We present a framework which facilitates research into
fine-grained subjective importance in compressed videos, which we then utilize
to improve the rate-distortion performance of an existing video codec (x264).
The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) we introduce a web-tool which
allows scalable collection of fine-grained perceptual importance, by having
users interactively paint spatio-temporal maps over encoded videos; (2) we use
this tool to collect a dataset with 178 videos with a total of 14443 frames of
human annotated spatio-temporal importance maps over the videos; and (3) we use
our curated dataset to train a lightweight machine learning model which can
predict these spatio-temporal importance regions. We demonstrate via a
subjective study that encoding the videos in our dataset while taking into
account the importance maps leads to higher perceptual quality at the same
bitrate, with the videos encoded with importance maps preferred $1.8 \times$
over the baseline videos. Similarly, we show that for the 18 videos in test

quality videos, $2 \times$ preferred over the baseline at the same bitrate.

dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., tendency to oversimplify)
and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous, gradualist
view necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and
intelligent machines. Efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or
bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at
multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that
living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time.
We refer to this as ""polycomputing"" - the ability of the same substrate to
simultaneously compute different things. This ability is an important way in
which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear,
deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of
computational materials as reported in the rapidly-growing physical computing
literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations
performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of
meso-scale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales.
Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and
develop the idea that overloading of different functions on the same hardware
is an important design principle that helps understand and build both evolved

well as evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative

faithful their representations are with respect to the semantic content of
texts. We formalize a notion of semantic faithfulness, in which the semantic
content of a text should causally figure in a model's inferences in question
answering. We then test this notion by observing a model's behavior on
answering questions about a story after performing two novel semantic
interventions -- deletion intervention and negation intervention. While
transformer models achieve high performance on standard question answering
tasks, we show that they fail to be semantically faithful once we perform these
interventions for a significant number of cases (~50% for deletion
intervention, and ~20% drop in accuracy for negation intervention). We then
propose an intervention-based training regime that can mitigate the undesirable
effects for deletion intervention by a significant margin (from ~50% to ~6%).
We analyze the inner-workings of the models to better understand the
effectiveness of intervention-based training for deletion intervention. But we
show that this training does not attenuate other aspects of semantic
unfaithfulness such as the models' inability to deal with negation intervention
or to capture the predicate-argument structure of texts. We also test
InstructGPT, via prompting, for its ability to handle the two interventions and
to capture predicate-argument structure. While InstructGPT models do achieve
very high performance on predicate-argument structure task, they fail to

embedding these dynamical systems into a lognormal state space model using an

more flexibility in fitting techniques. We discuss two existing lognormal state

use 180 synthetic datasets to compare the forecasting performance under model
misspecification and assess estimability of precision parameters between our
method and existing methods. We find that our models well under

improve estimation of the process variance and improves forecast performance.
To test our method on a difficult problem, we compare the predictive
performance of two lognormal state space models in predicting Leaf Area Index

uncertainty on transfer observables. We use Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulations to obtain parameter posterior distributions. We use
elastic-scattering cross sections to constrain the optical potential parameters
and use the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the final state to
constrain the bound state interaction. We then propagate these posteriors to
the transfer angular distributions and obtain confidence intervals for this
observable. We study (d,p) reactions on 14C, 16O, and 48Ca at energies in the

the asymptotic normalization coefficient as a constraint, particularly for
those reactions most sensitive to ambiguities in the mean-field. For those
reactions, the importance of constraining the bound state interaction is equal
to that of constrain the optical potentials. The case of 14C is an outlier
because it populates a halo state, and the observable is less sensitive to the
nuclear interior. We conclude that when minimal constraints are used on the
parameters of the nucleon-target interaction, the 68% confidence interval
uncertainties on the differential cross sections are very large (~ 140-185%).

  Our method allows users to efficiently edit the appearance of the 3D scene by
modifying the color palettes. We also extend our framework with compressed

Networks (GNNs). While previous works have only demonstrated that oversmoothing
is inevitable when the number of graph convolutions tends to infinity, in this
paper, we precisely characterize the mechanism behind the phenomenon via a
non-asymptotic analysis. Specifically, we distinguish between two different
effects when applying graph convolutions -- an undesirable mixing effect that
homogenizes node representations in different classes, and a desirable
denoising effect that homogenizes node representations in the same class. By
quantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual
Stochastic Block Model (CSBM), we show that oversmoothing happens once the
mixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers
required for this transition is $O(\log N/\log (\log N))$ for sufficiently
dense graphs with $N$ nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects
of Personalized PageRank (PPR), or equivalently, the effects of initial
residual connections on oversmoothing. Our results suggest that while PPR
mitigates oversmoothing at deeper layers, PPR-based architectures still achieve
their best performance at a shallow depth and are outperformed by the graph
convolution approach on certain graphs. Finally, we support our theoretical
results with numerical experiments, which further suggest that the
oversmoothing phenomenon observed in practice can be magnified by the
difficulty of optimizing deep GNN models.

nonparametric approach for directional-linear data based on the Dirichlet
process. We first extend the projected normal distribution to model the joint
distribution of linear variables and a directional variable with arbitrary
dimension as a projection of a higher-dimensional augmented multivariate normal
distribution (MVN). We call the new distribution the semi-projected normal

used as the mixture distribution in a Dirichlet process model to obtain a more
flexible class of models for directional-linear data. We propose a normal
conditional inverse-Wishart distribution as part of the prior distribution to
address an identifiability issue inherited from the projected normal and
preserve conjugacy with the SPN distribution. A Gibbs sampling algorithm is
provided for posterior inference. Experiments on synthetic data and the
Berkeley image database show superior performance of the Dirichlet process SPN
mixture model (DPSPN) in clustering compared to other directional-linear

few successful applications of deep RL to quantum control problems, most of the
existing RL algorithms suffer from instabilities and unsatisfactory
reproducibility, and require a large amount of fine-tuning and a large
computational budget, both of which limit their applicability. To resolve the
issue of instabilities, in this dissertation, we investigate the
non-convergence issue of Q-learning. Then, we investigate the weakness of
existing convergent approaches that have been proposed, and we develop a new
convergent Q-learning algorithm, which we call the convergent deep Q network
(C-DQN) algorithm, as an alternative to the conventional deep Q network (DQN)

we apply the algorithm to the measurement-feedback cooling problems of a

AmbiBench, a new benchmark of six ambiguously-specified classification tasks.
We evaluate humans and models on AmbiBench by seeing how well they identify the

different numbers of labeled examples. We find that the combination of model
scaling (to 175B parameters) and training with human feedback data enables
models to approach or exceed the accuracy of human participants across tasks,
but that either one alone is not sufficient. In addition, we show how to
dramatically improve the accuracy of language models trained without
large-scale human feedback training by finetuning on a small number of

in various domains, including textual, graph structural, and relational triple
representations. This development opened the door to new relation extraction
beyond the traditional text-oriented relation extraction. However, research on
the effectiveness of considering multiple heterogeneous domain information
simultaneously is still under exploration, and if a model can take an advantage
of integrating heterogeneous information, it is expected to exhibit a
significant contribution to many problems in the world. This thesis works on
Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) from the literature as a case study and realizes
relation extraction utilizing heterogeneous domain information. First, a deep
neural relation extraction model is prepared and its attention mechanism is
analyzed. Next, a method to combine the drug molecular structure information
and drug description information to the input sentence information is proposed,
and the effectiveness of utilizing drug molecular structures and drug
descriptions for the relation extraction task is shown. Then, in order to
further exploit the heterogeneous information, drug-related items, such as
protein entries, medical terms and pathways are collected from multiple
existing databases and a new data set in the form of a knowledge graph (KG) is
constructed. A link prediction task on the constructed data set is conducted to
obtain embedding representations of drugs that contain the heterogeneous domain
information. Finally, a method that integrates the input sentence information
and the heterogeneous KG information is proposed. The proposed model is trained
and evaluated on a widely used data set, and as a result, it is shown that
utilizing heterogeneous domain information significantly improves the

lattice with a mosaic off-diagonal quasi-periodic hopping. It is found that the
localization properties of zero-energy states depend sensitively on the parity
of mosaic modulation period $\kappa$. If the mosaic period is an odd integer,
there is no Anderson localization transition for an arbitrarily large
quasiperiodic hopping. The zero-energy state is a critical state. While for an
even number period and a generic quasiperiodic hopping, the zero-energy state
would be a localized edge state at left (or right)-hand end of system. The
above even-odd effects of mosaic period have been also transmitted into the
other eigenstates near zero-energy. More specifically, when mosaic period is
odd, there always exists an energy window in which the eigenstates are critical
for arbitrarily strong quasiperiodic hopping. While for even period, there
exists Anderson localization transition as the hopping strength increases. In
addition, the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and the mobility edges $E_c$ are
exactly obtained. With the Lyapunov exponent, we further find that there exist
critical regions in the parameter $\tau-E$ (for $\kappa=1$) and $\lambda-E$
(for $\kappa>1$) plane. Furthermore, when $E$ approaches mobility edges $E_c$,
it is found that the critical index of localization length is $\nu=1$. At the
end, we show that the systems with different $E$ can be characterized by
Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and Avila acceleration $\omega(E)$.

questions regarding radiology images, assisting doctors with decision-making
options. Nevertheless, current Medical-VQA models learn cross-modal
representations through residing vision and texture encoders in dual separate
spaces, which lead to indirect semantic alignment. In this paper, we propose
UnICLAM, a Unified and Interpretable Medical-VQA model through Contrastive
Representation Learning with Adversarial Masking. Specifically, to learn an
aligned image-text representation, we first establish a unified dual-stream
pre-training structure with the gradually soft-parameter sharing strategy.
Technically, the proposed strategy learns a constraint for the vision and
texture encoders to be close in a same space, which is gradually loosened as
the higher number of layers. Moreover, for grasping the unified semantic
representation, we extend the adversarial masking data augmentation to the
contrastive representation learning of vision and text in a unified manner.
Concretely, while the encoder training minimizes the distance between original
and masking samples, the adversarial masking module keeps adversarial learning
to conversely maximize the distance. Furthermore, we also intuitively take a
further exploration to the unified adversarial masking augmentation model,
which improves the potential ante-hoc interpretability with remarkable
performance and efficiency. Experimental results on VQA-RAD and SLAKE public
benchmarks demonstrate that UnICLAM outperforms existing 11 state-of-the-art
Medical-VQA models. More importantly, we make an additional discussion about

used to monitor variation in a process. They have been shown to perform well
for monitoring processes under the general assumptions that the observations

constructing the robust X-bar control charts, which can simultaneously deal
with both data contamination and unequal sample sizes. The proposed method for
the process parameters is optimal in a sense of the best linear unbiased

many scientific applications need to store large amounts of data and post
process this data for scientific discovery. Unlike image and video compression
algorithms that limit errors to primary data, scientists require compression
techniques that accurately preserve derived quantities of interest (QoIs). This
paper presents a physics-informed compression technique implemented as an
end-to-end, scalable, GPU-based pipeline for data compression that addresses
this requirement. Our hybrid compression technique combines machine learning
techniques and standard compression methods. Specifically, we combine an
autoencoder, an error-bounded lossy compressor to provide guarantees on raw
data error, and a constraint satisfaction post-processing step to preserve the
QoIs within a minimal error (generally less than floating point error).
  The effectiveness of the data compression pipeline is demonstrated by
compressing nuclear fusion simulation data generated by a large-scale fusion
code, XGC, which produces hundreds of terabytes of data in a single day. Our
approach works within the ADIOS framework and results in compression by a
factor of more than 150 while requiring only a few percent of the computational
resources necessary for generating the data, making the overall approach highly
effective for practical scenarios.

which weakly interacts with the standard model (SM) particles. The weakness of

coupling does not always guarantee the weakness of the interaction. When the
mass of the mediator particle lies in a threshold region, the so-called
threshold singularity may emerge, and then the perturbative calculation fails.
This singularity causes several effects, e.g., the mixing between the mediator

mediator particle decay, etc. Taking the minimal model of the vector mediator
particle decaying mainly into the SM particles as an example, we develop a
method to describe the singularity quantitatively. We also calculate some

CTCNet learns hierarchical auditory and visual representations in a bottom-up

the auditory and visual cortical areas. Then, inspired by the large number of
connections between cortical regions and the thalamus, the model fuses the
auditory and visual information in a thalamic subnetwork through top-down
connections. Finally, the model transmits this fused information back to the
auditory and visual subnetworks, and the above process is repeated several
times. The results of experiments on three speech separation benchmark datasets
show that CTCNet remarkably outperforms existing AVSS methods with
considerablely fewer parameters. These results suggest that mimicking the

platforms for non-classical light sources and quantum logic gates which form
the foundation of photonic quantum technologies. However, to date, coherent
manipulation of single charge carriers in quantum dots is limited mainly to
their lowest orbital states. Ultrafast coherent control of high-orbital states
is obstructed by the demand for tunable terahertz pulses. To break this
constraint, we demonstrate an all-optical method to control high-orbital states
of a hole via stimulated Auger process. The coherent nature of the Auger
process is proved by Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference with a fidelity
of 95.9%. Harnessing this coherence further enables the investigation of
single-hole relaxation mechanism. A hole relaxation time of 161 ps is observed
and attributed to the phonon bottleneck effect. Our work opens new
possibilities for understanding the fundamental properties of high-orbital
states in quantum emitters and developing new types of orbital-based quantum
photonic devices.

  Entailment Recognition",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The widely studied task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) requires a system
to recognize whether one piece of text is textually entailed by another, i.e.
whether the entirety of its meaning can be inferred from the other. In current
NLI datasets and models, textual entailment relations are typically defined on
the sentence- or paragraph-level. However, even a simple sentence often
contains multiple propositions, i.e. distinct units of meaning conveyed by the
sentence. As these propositions can carry different truth values in the context
of a given premise, we argue for the need to recognize the textual entailment
relation of each proposition in a sentence individually.
  We propose PropSegmEnt, a corpus of over 45K propositions annotated by expert
human raters. Our dataset structure resembles the tasks of (1) segmenting
sentences within a document to the set of propositions, and (2) classifying the
entailment relation of each proposition with respect to a different yet
topically-aligned document, i.e. documents describing the same event or entity.
We establish strong baselines for the segmentation and entailment tasks.
Through case studies on summary hallucination detection and document-level NLI,
we demonstrate that our conceptual framework is potentially useful for
understanding and explaining the compositionality of NLI labels.

as an agent in affecting in-situ star formation as well as the motions of gas
and stars. We observe cases with a `shallow-steep' metallicity radial profile,
with evidence of the bar flattening the metallicity gradients inside the bar
region (NGC~5068 and NGC~1566) and also note instances where the bar appears to
drive a steeper metallicity gradient producing `steep-shallow' metallicity
profiles (NGC~1365 and NGC~1744). For NGC~2835, a `steep-shallow' metallicity
gradient break occurs at a distance $\sim$ 4 times the bar radius, which is
more likely driven by gas accretion to the outskirt of the galaxy instead of
the bar. The variation of metallicity gradients around the bar region traces
the fluctuations of star formation rate surface density in NGC~1365, NGC~1566

enables the bed to reach a maximum horizontal acceleration of 11.8 m/s^2 (1.2

with an accelerometer and a high frame-rate camera for bed motion estimation.
The low cost and easy use make the Shakebot accessible to a wide range of

An important application of the Shakebot is to examine the dynamics of
precariously balanced rocks (PBRs), which are negative indicators of
earthquakes in nature. Our earlier research built a virtual shake robot in
simulation for the PBR study. The Shakebot provides an approach to validate the
simulation through physical experiments. The ROS-based perception and motion

noisy-label learning problem, which rely on learning an unsupervised label
cleaner first to divide the training samples into a labeled set for clean data
and an unlabeled set for noise data. Typically, the cleaner is obtained via
fitting a mixture model to the distribution of per-sample training losses.
However, the modeling procedure is \emph{class agnostic} and assumes the loss
distributions of clean and noise samples are the same across different classes.
Unfortunately, in practice, such an assumption does not always hold due to the
varying learning difficulty of different classes, thus leading to sub-optimal
label noise partition criteria. In this work, we reveal this long-ignored
problem and propose a simple yet effective solution, named \textbf{C}lass
\textbf{P}rototype-based label noise \textbf{C}leaner (\textbf{CPC}). Unlike
previous works treating all the classes equally, CPC fully considers loss
distribution heterogeneity and applies class-aware modulation to partition the
clean and noise data. CPC takes advantage of loss distribution modeling and
intra-class consistency regularization in feature space simultaneously and thus
can better distinguish clean and noise labels. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method by explaining it from the Expectation-Maximization
(EM) framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on the noisy-label

CPC consistently brings about performance improvement across all benchmarks.

  Generalization in Pretrained Models","Preprint",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Human linguistic capacity is often characterized by compositionality and the
generalization it enables -- human learners can produce and comprehend novel
complex expressions by composing known parts. Several benchmarks exploit
distributional control across training and test to gauge compositional
generalization, where certain lexical items only occur in limited contexts
during training. While recent work using these benchmarks suggests that
pretrained models achieve impressive generalization performance, we argue that
exposure to pretraining data may break the aforementioned distributional
control. Using the COGS benchmark of Kim and Linzen (2020), we test two
modified evaluation setups that control for this issue: (1) substituting
context-controlled lexical items with novel character sequences, and (2)
substituting them with special tokens represented by novel embeddings. We find
that both of these setups lead to lower generalization performance in T5
(Raffel et al., 2020), suggesting that previously reported results have been
overestimated due to uncontrolled lexical exposure during pretraining. The
performance degradation is more extreme with novel embeddings, and the
degradation increases with the amount of pretraining data, highlighting an
interesting case of inverse scaling.

equations with polynomial vector fields of arbitrary degree on quantum

differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equation (PDEs) can be
challenging to solve on classical computers due to high dimensionality,
stiffness, nonlinearities, and sensitive dependence to initial conditions. For
sparse $n$-dimensional linear ODEs, quantum algorithms have been developed
which can produce a quantum state proportional to the solution in poly(log(nx))
time using the quantum linear systems algorithm (QLSA). Recently, this
framework was extended to systems of nonlinear ODEs with quadratic polynomial
vector fields by applying Carleman linearization that enables the embedding of
the quadratic system into an approximate linear form. A detailed complexity
analysis was conducted which showed significant computational advantage under
certain conditions. We present an extension of this algorithm to deal with
systems of nonlinear ODEs with $k$-th degree polynomial vector fields for
arbitrary (finite) values of $k$. The steps involve: 1) mapping the $k$-th
degree polynomial ODE to a higher dimensional quadratic polynomial ODE; 2)
applying Carleman linearization to transform the quadratic ODE to an
infinite-dimensional system of linear ODEs; 3) truncating and discretizing the
linear ODE and solving using the forward Euler method and QLSA. Alternatively,
one could apply Carleman linearization directly to the $k$-th degree polynomial
ODE, resulting in a system of infinite-dimensional linear ODEs, and then apply
step 3. This solution route can be computationally more efficient. We present
detailed complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms, prove polynomial
scaling of runtime on $k$ and demonstrate the framework on an example.

Current class-conditional diffusion models, however, implicitly model the

in scientific domains, are rife with internal structure. To take advantage of
this structure, we propose hierarchically branched diffusion models as a novel
framework for class-conditional generation. Branched diffusion models
explicitly leverage the inherent relationships between distinct classes in the
dataset to learn the underlying diffusion process in a hierarchical manner. We
highlight several advantages of branched diffusion models over the current
state-of-the-art methods for class-conditional diffusion. Firstly, they can be
easily extended to novel classes in a continual-learning setting at scale.
Secondly, they enable more sophisticated forms of conditional generation, such
as analogy-based conditional generation (i.e. transmutation). Finally, they
offer a novel interpretability into the class-conditional generation process.
We extensively evaluate branched diffusion models on several benchmark and
large real-world scientific datasets, spanning different data modalities
(images, tabular data, and graphs). In particular, we showcase the advantages
of branched diffusion models on a real-world single-cell RNA-seq dataset, where
our branched model leverages the intrinsic hierarchical structure between human

The observation covers the orbital phase of $\Phi=0.199$-$0.414$ of the source,
where $\Phi=0$ corresponds to the mid-eclipse. The orbital-phase-resolved
spectroscopy revealed that low energy photons are more dominant for the
spectral fluctuation, and a large part of the variability can be explained in
terms of absorption by clumps of stellar wind. The spin-phase-resolved
spectroscopy together with energy-resolved pulse profiles, on the other hand,
presented large flux variations in high energy bands, which suggests that the
origin of the variability is the different efficiency of Comptonization inside
the accretion column. The energy band which includes Fe emission lines or
cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) shows distinct variability
compared to the nearby bands. The Fe lines show low variability along the spin
phase, which indicates that the emission regions are apart from the neutron
star. The central energy and strength of the CRSF are both positively
correlated with the spin-phase-resolved flux, which suggests that the emitted
photons face stronger magnetic fields and deeper absorption when they come from
high-flux regions. We also examined the independence of the orbital- and
spin-phase variability. They showed no correlation with each other and were
highly independent, which implies the accretion stream is stable during the
observation.

incorporating a ranking-based loss that implicitly calibrates abstinent

cost of new drug development. While drug repositioning can omit various R&D
processes, confirming pharmacological effects on biomolecules is essential for
application to new diseases. Biomedical explainability in a drug repositioning
model can support appropriate insights in subsequent in-depth studies. However,
the validity of the XAI methodology is still under debate, and the
effectiveness of XAI in drug repositioning prediction applications remains
unclear. In this study, we propose GraphIX, an explainable drug repositioning
framework using biological networks, and quantitatively evaluate its
explainability. GraphIX first learns the network weights and node features
using a graph neural network from known drug indication and knowledge graph
that consists of three types of nodes (but not given node type information):
disease, drug, and protein. Analysis of the post-learning features showed that
node types that were not known to the model beforehand are distinguished
through the learning process based on the graph structure. From the learned
weights and features, GraphIX then predicts the disease-drug association and
calculates the contribution values of the nodes located in the neighborhood of
the predicted disease and drug. We hypothesized that the neighboring protein
node to which the model gave a high contribution is important in understanding
the actual pharmacological effects. Quantitative evaluation of the validity of
protein nodes' contribution using a real-world database showed that the high
contribution proteins shown by GraphIX are reasonable as a mechanism of drug
action. GraphIX is a framework for evidence-based drug discovery that can
present to users new disease-drug associations and identify the protein

token that has been fully contextualized and when conditioned on only the
decontextualized lexical prior of the model. This comparison can be understood
as quantifying the contribution of contextualization towards reconstruction --
the difference in the reconstruction probabilities can only be attributed to
the representational change of the single token induced by contextualization.
We apply this analysis to three MLMs and find that contextualization boosts
reconstructability of tokens that are close to the token being reconstructed in
terms of linear and syntactic distance. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to
finer-grained decomposition of contextualized representations, and we find that
these boosts are largely attributable to static and positional embeddings at

efficient utilization of resources by processing only required data or reducing
operations on data. The processed data caching in the main memory or disk can
resolve this issue and avoid repeated processing of data. However, limitations
of resources like main memory space, storage IO speeds, and additional storage

scalable solutions for cloud or in-house deployments. This paper presents
improvements to the raw data query processing framework by integrating a
resource monitoring module. The experiments were performed using a scientific
dataset known Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Analysis of monitored resources
revealed that sampling queries had the lowest resource utilization. The
PostgresRAW can answer simple 0-JOIN queries faster than PostgreSQL. While one

reproduce the contribution of mass transfer from a large target to a small
projectile, which occurs for a mass ratio of $\gtrsim 3$ and is shown in a
previous study (Hasegawa et al. 2021). We found that the power-law index of the
cumulative mass distribution of the small fragments is independent of the mass
ratio and only weakly dependent on the collision velocity. On the other hand,
the mass fraction of fragments of individual dust monomers decreases with an
increasing total mass of colliding aggregates for a fixed mass ratio. This
tendency implies that multiple hierarchical disruptive collisions (i.e.,
collisions between fragments, collisions between fragments of fragments) are
required for producing a large amount of individual dust monomers via
collisional fragmentation. Our fragment model suggests that the total geometric
cross section integrated over the fragments is estimated to be about the same

teacher-student network intelligently learns spatial and temporal features from
labeled and unlabeled CSI datasets. Additionally, the enhanced penalized loss

i.e., features of new datasets affected by time-varying effects and altered

imaging with supervised deep learning to enable high-quality imaging of
hard-to-reach areas. Nevertheless, the supervised deep learning method imposes
strict constraints on fiber-optic imaging systems, where the input objects and
the fiber outputs have to be collected in pairs. To unleash the full potential
of fiber-optic imaging, unsupervised image reconstruction is in demand.
Unfortunately, neither optical fiber bundles nor multimode fibers can achieve a
point-to-point transmission of the object with a high sampling density, as is a
prerequisite for unsupervised image reconstruction. The recently proposed
disordered fibers offer a new solution based on the transverse Anderson
localization. Here, we demonstrate unsupervised full-color imaging with a
cellular resolution through a meter-long disordered fiber in both transmission
and reflection modes. The unsupervised image reconstruction consists of two
stages. In the first stage, we perform a pixel-wise standardization on the
fiber outputs using the statistics of the objects. In the second stage, we
recover the fine details of the reconstructions through a generative
adversarial network. Unsupervised image reconstruction does not need paired
images, enabling a much more flexible calibration under various conditions. Our
new solution achieves full-color high-fidelity cell imaging within a working
distance of at least 4 mm by only collecting the fiber outputs after an initial
calibration. High imaging robustness is also demonstrated when the disordered
fiber is bent with a central angle of 60{\deg}. Moreover, the cross-domain
generality on unseen objects is shown to be enhanced with a diversified object
set.

weakly-augmented unlabeled data, which enables learning depth without
supervision. In this framework, a novel data augmentation is proposed to take
the advantage of a naive masking strategy as an augmentation, while avoiding
its scale ambiguity problem between depths from weakly- and strongly-augmented
branches and risk of missing small-scale instances. To only retain
high-confident depth predictions from the weakly-augmented branch as
pseudo-labels, we also present an uncertainty estimation technique, which is
used to define robust consistency regularization. Experiments on KITTI and
NYU-Depth-v2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, its
robustness to the use of fewer depth-annotated images, and superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods for monocular depth

combinations of rectifiable measures. They are possibly singular with respect
to the Lebesgue measure and generalize continuous-discrete mixtures. A
stratified measure $\rho$ can thus be represented as $\sum_{i=1}^k q_i \rho_i$,
where $(q_1,..,q_k)$ is a probability vector and each $\rho_i$ is
$m_i$-rectifiable for some integer $m_i$ i.e. absolutely continuous with
respect to the $m_i$-Hausdorff measure $\mu_i$ on a $m_i$-rectifiable set $E_i$
(e.g. a smooth $m_i$-manifold). We introduce a set of strongly typical
realizations of $\rho^{\otimes n}$ (memoryless source) that occur with high
probability. The typical realizations are supported on a finite union of strata
$\{E_{i_1}\times \cdots \times E_{i_n}\}$ whose dimension concentrates around
the mean dimension $\sum_{i=1}^k q_i m_i$. For each $n$, an appropriate sum of
Hausdorff measures on the different strata gives a natural notion of reference
""volume""; the exponential growth rate of the typical set's volume is quantified
by Csiszar's generalized entropy of $\rho$ with respect to $\mu=\sum_{i=1}^k

and that the conditional term is related to the volume growth of the typical
realizations in each stratum. The chain rule and its asymptotic interpretation
hold in the more general framework of piecewise continuous measures: convex
combinations of measures restricted to pairwise disjoint sets equipped with

first-principles simulations to identify the H positions. Through the
simulations, we could consider various fundamental deprotonation reactions

in the crystal, thereby leading to the structural stabilization. We further
investigated the crystal anisotropy in an actual capacitive material by
considering the growth mechanism of the CCH crystal. By associating our X-ray

contrast-weighted images like T1-weighted, T2-weighted, etc., can be
synthesized directly from parameter maps through spin-dynamics simulation
(i.e., Bloch or Extended Phase Graph models). However, these approaches often
exhibit artifacts due to imperfections in the mapping, the sequence modeling,
and the data acquisition. Here we propose a supervised learning-based method
that directly synthesizes contrast-weighted images from the MRF data without
going through the quantitative mapping and spin-dynamics simulation. To
implement our direct contrast synthesis (DCS) method, we deploy a conditional
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework and propose a multi-branch U-Net

contrast-weighted scans. In-vivo experiments demonstrate excellent image
quality compared to simulation-based contrast synthesis and previous DCS

more faithfully represent conventional spin echo-based contrast-weighted

(Alice) to steer, by her choice between two measurement settings, the quantum
system of another party (Bob) into two distinct ensembles of pure states. As
later formalized as a quantum information task, EPR-steering can be shown even
when the distinct ensembles comprise mixed states, provided they are pure
enough and different enough. Consider the scenario where Alice and Bob each
have a qubit and Alice performs dichotomic projective measurements. In this
case, the states in the ensembles to which she can steer form the surface of an
ellipsoid ${\cal E}$ in Bob's Bloch ball. Further, let the steering ellipsoid
${\cal E}$ have nonzero volume. It has previously been shown that if Alice's
first measurement setting yields an ensemble comprising two pure states, then
this, plus any one other measurement setting, will demonstrate EPR-steering.
Here we consider what one can say if the ensemble from Alice's first setting
contains only one pure state $\mathsf{p}\in{\cal E}$, occurring with
probability $p_\mathsf{p}$. Using projective geometry, we derive the necessary
and sufficient condition analytically for Alice to be able to demonstrate
EPR-steering of Bob's state using this and some second setting, when the two
ensembles from these lie in a given plane. Based on this, we show that, for a
given ${\cal E}$, if $p_\mathsf{p}$ is high enough [$p_{\sf p} > p_{\rm
max}^{{\cal E}} \in [0,1)$] then any distinct second setting by Alice is

response to the rapid growth of wireless traffic. This paper studies an
integrated network design that boosts system capacity through cooperation
between wireless access points (APs) and a satellite for enhancing the
network's spectral efficiency. We first mathematically derive an achievable
throughput expression for the uplink (UL) data transmission over spatially
correlated Rician channels. Our generic achievable throughput expression is
applicable for arbitrary received signal detection techniques under realistic
imperfect channel estimates. A closed-form expression is then obtained for the
ergodic UL data throughput when maximum ratio combining is utilized for
detecting the desired signals. As for our resource allocation contributions, we
formulate the max-min fairness and total transmit power optimization problems
relying on the channel statistics for performing power allocation. The solution
of each optimization problem is derived in form of a low-complexity iterative
design, in which each data power variable is updated relying on a closed-form
expression. Our integrated hybrid network concept allows users to be served
that may not otherwise be accommodated due to the excessive data demands. The
algorithms proposed to allow us to address the congestion issues appearing when
at least one user is served at a rate below the target. The mathematical
analysis is also illustrated with the aid of our numerical results that show
the added benefits of considering the space links in terms of improving the
ergodic data throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms smoothly
circumvent any potential congestion, especially in face of high rate

energy and extend their travel distance by leveraging ground vehicles.
Achieving dynamic perching places high demands on the performance of trajectory
planning and terminal state accuracy in SE(3). However, in the perching
process, uncertainties in target surface prediction, tracking control and
external disturbances may cause trajectory planning failure or lead to
unacceptable terminal errors. To address these challenges, we first propose a
trajectory planner that considers adaptation to uncertainties in target
prediction and tracking control. To facilitate this work, the reachable set of
quadrotors' states is first analyzed. The states whose reachable sets possess
the largest coverage probability for uncertainty targets, are defined as
optimal waypoints. Subsequently, an approach to seek local optimal waypoints
for static and moving uncertainty targets is proposed. A real-time trajectory
planner based on optimized waypoints is developed accordingly. Secondly, thrust
regulation is also implemented in the terminal attitude tracking stage to
handle external disturbances. When a quadrotor's attitude is commanded to align
with target surfaces, the thrust is optimized to minimize terminal errors. This
makes the terminal position and velocity be controlled in closed-loop manner.
Therefore, the resistance to disturbances and terminal accuracy is improved.
Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our methods can improve the
accuracy of terminal states under uncertainties. The success rate is
approximately increased by $50\%$ compared to the two-end planner without
thrust regulation. Perching on the rear window of a car is also achieved using
our proposed heterogeneous cooperation system outdoors. This validates the
feasibility and practicality of our methods.

infrastructures such as ships (CyberShips) has brought huge benefits, yet it
has also opened new avenues for cyber attacks to potentially disrupt
operations. Cyber risk assessment plays a vital role in identifying cyber
threats and vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise cyber systems.
A number of methodologies have been proposed to carry out these analyses. This
paper evaluates and compares the application of three risk assessment
methodologies: system theoretic process analysis (STPA-Sec), STRIDE and CORAS
for identifying threats and vulnerabilities in a CyberShip system. We
specifically selected these three methodologies because they identify threats
not only at the component level, but also threats or hazards caused due to the
interaction between components, resulting in sets of threats identified with
each methodology and relevant differences. Moreover, STPA-Sec which is a
variant of the STPA is widely used for safety and security analysis of cyber
physical systems (CPS); CORAS offers a framework to perform cyber risk
assessment in a top-down approach that aligns with STPA-Sec; and STRIDE
(Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service,
Elevation of Privilege) considers threat at the component level as well as
during the interaction that is similar to STPA-Sec. As a result of this
analysis, this paper highlights the pros and cons of these methodologies,
illustrates areas of special applicability, and suggests that their
complementary use as threats identified through STRIDE can be used as an input
to CORAS and STPA-Sec to make these methods more structured.

has attracted growing attention as a model system of highly frustrated quantum
magnetism. A further motivation for theoretical studies comes from the recent
discovery of SK spin-liquid compounds. The SK antiferromagnet exhibits two
non-equivalent nearest-neighbor bonds $J_1$ and $J_2$. One may expect that in
SK compounds $J_1$ and $J_2$ are of different strength. We present a numerical
study of finite systems by means of the finite-temperature Lanczos method. We
discuss the temperature dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$, the entropy
$S(T)$, and of the susceptibility $X(T)$ of the $J_1$-$J_2$ SK Heisenberg
antiferromagnet varying $J_2/J_1$ in the range $0 \le J_2/J_1 \le 4$. We also
discuss the zero-field ground state of the model. We find indications for a
magnetically disordered singlet ground state for $0 \le J_2/J_1 \lesssim 1.65$.
Beyond $J_2/J_1 \sim 1.65$ the singlet ground state gives way for a
ferrimagnetic ground state. In the region $0.77 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 1.65$
the low-temperature thermodynamics is dominated by a finite singlet-triplet gap
filled with low-lying singlet excitations leading to an exponentially activated
low-temperature behavior of $X(T)$. On the other hand, the low-lying singlets
yield an extra maximum or a shoulder-like profile below the main maximum in the
$C(T)$ curve. For $J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.7$ the low-temperature thermodynamics is
characterized by a large fraction of $N/3$ weakly coupled spins leading to a
sizable amount of entropy at very low temperatures. In an applied magnetic
field the magnetization process features plateaus and jumps in a wide range of
$J_2/J_1$.

  Models","CVPR 2023 Camera Ready Version",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent zero-shot
generalization to new language tasks. However, effective utilization of LLMs
for zero-shot visual question-answering (VQA) remains challenging, primarily
due to the modality disconnection and task disconnection between LLM and VQA
task. End-to-end training on vision and language data may bridge the
disconnections, but is inflexible and computationally expensive. To address
this issue, we propose \emph{Img2Prompt}, a plug-and-play module that provides
the prompts that can bridge the aforementioned modality and task
disconnections, so that LLMs can perform zero-shot VQA tasks without end-to-end
training. In order to provide such prompts, we further employ LLM-agnostic
models to provide prompts that can describe image content and self-constructed
question-answer pairs, which can effectively guide LLM to perform zero-shot VQA
tasks. Img2Prompt offers the following benefits: 1) It can flexibly work with
various LLMs to perform VQA. 2)~Without the needing of end-to-end training, it
significantly reduces the cost of deploying LLM for zero-shot VQA tasks. 3) It
achieves comparable or better performance than methods relying on end-to-end
training. For example, we outperform Flamingo \cite{Deepmind:Flamingo2022} by
5.6\% on VQAv2. On the challenging A-OKVQA dataset, our method even outperforms
few-shot methods by as much as 20\%.

Counter Net-a model architecture that combines a predictor and a counterfactual

VCNet is able to both generate predictions, and to generate counterfactual
explanations without having to solve another minimisation problem. Our
contribution is the generation of counterfactuals that are close to the
distribution of the predicted class. This is done by learning a variational
autoencoder conditionally to the output of the predictor in a join-training
fashion. We present an empirical evaluation on tabular datasets and across
several interpretability metrics. The results are competitive with the

  Reaction Networks","7 figures and supplementary file included",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stochastic simulations of biochemical reaction networks generate sequences of
random reaction events in order to track the evolution of chemical species
counts. The trajectories of species counts are used to infer the dynamic
properties of reaction networks. In this paper, well-stirred models of
biochemical reaction networks are analyzed assuming instead reaction event
time-series. Since the events are categorical rather than numerical variables,
their analysis relies on their empirical conditional probabilities. In
particular, it is proposed to identify the reaction event sub-sequences that
are conditionally nearly certain or nearly uncertain as being causally related
or unrelated, respectively. Moreover, since time-ordering of reactions is
locally irrelevant, the event sub-sequences can be transformed into event sets
or multi-sets. The appropriately defined distance metrics allows identifying
equivalent event sub-sequences, which is used to implement a computationally
efficient causal or anti-causal query-response mechanism for identifying the
causally associated event sub-sequences. The proposed framework for analyzing
the reaction event time-series is studied assuming 5 selected models of genetic
networks in 5 defined numerical experiments. The models are described and
simulated in BioNetGen using the open-source stochastic simulator NFsim, which
had to be modified to allow recording of the history of reaction events. The
generated event time-series are analyzed by Python and Matlab scripts. The
whole process of data generation, analysis and visualization has been nearly
fully automated using shell scripts. Such automation of data generation and
processing pipelines demonstrates the opportunities for a substantial increase

variables. These operators are real linear partial differential operators which
behave well on quaternionic polynomials, with properties analogous to the ones
satisfied by the Wirtinger derivatives of several complex variables. Due to the
non-commutativity of the variables, Wirtinger operators turn out to be of
higher order, except the first ones that are of the first order. In spite of
that, these operators commute each other and satisfy a Leibniz rule for
products. Moreover, they characterize the class of slice-regular polynomials,
and more generally of slice-regular quaternionic functions. As a step towards
the definition of the Wirtinger operators, we provide Almansi-type
decompositions for slice functions and for slice-regular functions of several
variables. We also introduce some aspects of local slice analysis, based on the
definition of locally slice-regular function in any open subset of the
$n$-dimensional quaternionic space.

representation learning. This paper presents a simple yet effective sample
construction strategy to boost the learning of motion features in video
contrastive learning. The proposed method, dubbed Motion-focused Quadruple
Construction (MoQuad), augments the instance discrimination by meticulously
disturbing the appearance and motion of both the positive and negative samples
to create a quadruple for each video instance, such that the model is
encouraged to exploit motion information. Unlike recent approaches that create
extra auxiliary tasks for learning motion features or apply explicit temporal
modelling, our method keeps the simple and clean contrastive learning paradigm
(i.e.,SimCLR) without multi-task learning or extra modelling. In addition, we
design two extra training strategies by analyzing initial MoQuad experiments.
By simply applying MoQuad to SimCLR, extensive experiments show that we achieve
superior performance on downstream tasks compared to the state of the arts.
Notably, on the UCF-101 action recognition task, we achieve 93.7% accuracy

Limiting distributions of this functional $X_n(\alpha)$ have been determined
for $\Re\alpha \neq 0$, revealing a transition between a complex normal
limiting distribution for $\Re\alpha < 0$ and a non-normal limiting
distribution for $\Re\alpha > 0$. In this paper, we complete the picture by
proving a normal limiting distribution, along with moment convergence, in the
missing case $\Re\alpha = 0$. The same results are also established in the case
of the so-called shape functional $X_n'(0)$, which is the sum of the logarithms
of all subtree sizes; these results were obtained earlier in special cases.
Additionally, we prove convergence of all moments in the case $\Re\alpha < 0$,
where this result was previously missing, and establish new results about the
asymptotic mean for real $\alpha < 1/2$.
  A novel feature for $\Re\alpha=0$ is that we find joint convergence for
several $\alpha$ to independent limits, in contrast to the cases
$\Re\alpha\neq0$, where the limit is known to be a continuous function of
$\alpha$. Another difference from the case $\Re\alpha\neq0$ is that there is a
logarithmic factor in the asymptotic variance when $\Re\alpha=0$; this holds
also for the shape functional.
  The proofs are largely based on singularity analysis of generating functions.

performance does not scale well with the number of available training samples

also powerful feature extractors, allowing them to be utilized in a black-box
manner and enabling the linear probing paradigm, where lightweight
discriminators are trained on top of the pre-extracted input representations.
This paper proposes prompt-augmented linear probing (PALP), a hybrid of linear
probing and ICL, which leverages the best of both worlds. PALP inherits the
scalability of linear probing and the capability of enforcing language models
to derive more meaningful representations via tailoring input into a more
conceivable form. Throughout in-depth investigations on various datasets, we
verified that PALP significantly enhances the input representations closing the
gap between ICL in the data-hungry scenario and fine-tuning in the
data-abundant scenario with little training overhead, potentially making PALP a
strong alternative in a black-box scenario.

measured by the cosine similarity. The network takes three view inputs resliced
from the same 3D image along different axes. Different from previous multi-view
networks, TMS-Net has a single encoder and three decoders, leading to better
noise robustness, segmentation performance and run-time quality estimation in
our experiments on the segmentation of the left atrium on STACOM 2013 and
STACOM 2018 challenge datasets. We also present a way to generate poor
segmentation masks by using noisy images generated with engineered noise and
Rician noise to simulate undertraining, high anisotropy and poor imaging

to 0.97 on STACOM 2018. We believe that TMS-Net and our run-time quality

whether it fairly reflects difference between languages. In this work, we
investigate the distributions of grammatical relations induced from mBERT in

local realistic theory. It can be detected by the violation of Bell's
inequality. In this work, we have considered the evaluation of Bell's
inequality with the help of the XOR game. In the XOR game, a two-qubit
entangled state is shared between the two distant players. It may generate a
non-local correlation between the players which contributes to the maximum
probability of winning of the game. We have aimed to determine the strength of
the non-locality through XOR game. Thus, we have defined a quantity $S_{NL}$
called the strength of non-locality, purely on the basis of the maximum
probability of winning of the XOR game. We have also derived the relation
between the introduced quantity $S_{NL}$ and the quantity $M$ introduced in
\cite{horo3}, to study the non-locality of a two-qubit entangled state problem
in depth. The quantity $M$ may be defined as the sum of the two largest
eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the given entangled state and it
determines whether the given entangled state under probe is non-local. Further,
we have explored the non-locality of any two-qubit entangled state, whose
non-locality cannot be detected by the CHSH inequality. Interestingly, we have
found that the newly defined quantity $S_{NL}$ fails to detect non-locality for
the entangled state, when the witness operator corresponding to $CHSH$ operator
cannot detect the entangled state. To overcome this problem, we have modified
the definition of the strength of non-locality and have shown that the modified
definition may detect the non-locality of such entangled states, which were
earlier undetected by $S_{NL}$. Furthermore, we have also provided two
applications of the strength $S_{NL}$ of the non-locality in controlled quantum

main ingredients of a theoretical approach based on the variational method,
with the discussion of the high accuracy obtained with them and the related

published his idea of ""neutron"" star, which burst upon him during his visit
over Europe in the previous year. The key point that motivated Landau to write
the paper is to make a state with lower energy for ""gigantic nucleus"", avoiding
extremely high kinematic energy of electron gas due to the new Fermi-Dirac

neutronize/neutralize by ""combining a proton and an electron"", as electron and
proton were supposed to be elementary before the discovery of neutron. However,
our understanding of the Nature has fundamentally improved today, and another
way (i.e., strangeonization) could also embody neutralization and thus a
low-energy state that Landau had in mind, which could further make
unprecedented opportunities in this multi-messenger era of astronomy. Strangeon
matter in ""old"" physics may impact dramatically on today's physics, from
compact stars initiated by Landau, to cosmic rays and dark matter. In this

essential subset of DA -- Mix-based Data Augmentation (MixDA) that generates
novel samples by mixing multiple examples. Unlike conventional DA approaches
based on a single-sample operation or requiring domain knowledge, MixDA is more
general in creating a broad spectrum of new data and has received increasing
attention in the community. We begin with proposing a new taxonomy classifying
MixDA into, Mixup-based, Cutmix-based, and hybrid approaches according to a
hierarchical view of the data mix. Various MixDA techniques are then
comprehensively reviewed in a more fine-grained way. Owing to its
generalization, MixDA has penetrated a variety of applications which are also
completely reviewed in this work. We also examine why MixDA works from
different aspects of improving model performance, generalization, and
calibration while explaining the model behavior based on the properties of
MixDA. Finally, we recapitulate the critical findings and fundamental
challenges of current MixDA studies, and outline the potential directions for
future works. Different from previous related works that summarize the DA
approaches in a specific domain (e.g., images or natural language processing)

systematical survey of MixDA in terms of its taxonomy, methodology,
applications, and explainability. This work can serve as a roadmap to MixDA
techniques and application reviews while providing promising directions for
researchers interested in this exciting area.

theories of holomorphic discs in twistor space whose boundaries lie on the
deformed real slice determined by $h$. The real $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries act

recent works have begun to train language models on narrative datasets which
require extracting the most critical information by integrating across long
contexts. However, it is still an open question whether these models are
learning a deeper understanding of the text, or if the models are simply
learning a heuristic to complete the task. This work investigates this further
by turning to the one language processing system that truly understands complex
language: the human brain. We show that training language models for deeper
narrative understanding results in richer representations that have improved
alignment to human brain activity. We further find that the improvements in
brain alignment are larger for character names than for other discourse
features, which indicates that these models are learning important narrative
elements. Taken together, these results suggest that this type of training can
indeed lead to deeper language understanding. These findings have consequences
both for cognitive neuroscience by revealing some of the significant factors
behind brain-NLP alignment, and for NLP by highlighting that understanding of

Each centre held the probability of five possession outcomes occurring

model were provided for each location on the pitch using linear and bilinear

different possession outcome probabilities and EPVs for every location on the

pinhole optics or micro pore optics (MPO), or alternatively by full-field X-ray
fluorescence imaging (FF-XRF). X-ray optics for FF-XRF can be manufactured with
different micro-channel geometries such as square, hexagonal or circular
channels. Each optic geometry creates different imaging artefacts.
Square-channel MPOs generate a high intensity central spot due to two
reflections via orthogonal channel walls inside a single channel, which is the
desirable part for image formation, and two perpendicular lines forming a cross
due to reflections in one plane only.
  Thus, we have studied the performance of a square-channel MPO in an FF-XRF
imaging system. The setup consists of a commercially available MPO provided by
Photonis and a Timepix3 readout chip with a silicon detector. Imaging of
fluorescence from small metal particles has been used to obtain the point
spread function (PSF) characteristics. The transmission through MPO channels
and variation of the critical reflection angle are characterized by
measurements of fluorescence from Copper and Titanium metal fragments. Since
the critical angle of reflection is energy dependent, the cross-arm artefacts
will affect the resolution differently for different fluorescence energies. It
is possible to identify metal fragments due to the form of the PSF function.
The PSF function can be further characterized using a Fourier transform to
suppress diffuse background signals in the image.

Raviart-Thomas functions, such that the divergence constraint is satisfied
exactly. In these methods arbitrary shape-regular simplicial grids can be used.
  In the present paper two alternatives for discretizing the convective terms
are considered. One variant leads to a scheme that still only involves volume
integrals, and the other variant employs upwinding known from DG schemes. Both
variants ensure the conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum in
some suitable sense. In addition, a pressure-robust and convection-robust
velocity error estimate is derived, i.e., the velocity error bound does not
depend on the pressure and the constant in the error bound for the kinetic
energy does not blow up for small viscosity. After condensation of the
enrichment unknowns and all non-constant pressure unknowns, the method can be
reduced to a $P_k-P_0$-like system for arbitrary velocity polynomial degree
$k$. Numerical studies verify the theoretical findings.

Overall, the progenitor stars lose less mass in stellar winds, resulting in
black holes as massive as $\sim 30\,M_\odot$, and, approximately half of them
avoid a mass-transfer episode before forming the first-born black hole.

relates to networks formed by molecular communications. By providing a means of
communication through the ubiquitously connected blood vessels (arteries,
veins, and capillaries), molecular communication-based IoBNT enables a host of
new eHealth applications. For example, an organ monitoring sensor can transfer
internal body signals through the IoBNT for health monitoring applications. We
empirically show that blood vessel channels introduce a new set of challenges
for the design of molecular communication systems in comparison to free-space
channels. We then propose cylindrical duct channel models and discuss the
corresponding system designs conforming to the channel characteristics.
Furthermore, based on prototype implementations, we confirm that molecular
communication techniques can be utilized for composing the IoBNT. We believe
that the promising results presented in this work, together with the rich
research challenges that lie ahead, are strong indicators that IoBNT with
molecular communications can drive novel applications for emerging eHealth
systems.

affect the experimental observables, e.g. recombination process and lifetime of

of electrons and holes we calculate the recombination rate in a cubic sample
with a single dipolar cluster of defects. It is shown that the large effect on

cascades towards the community core guided by increasing tie strength.

for the identification of good candidate set ups and operating conditions. In
this paper, we present the key features of a model-based framework for the
identification and assessment of process design spaces, integrating the
analysis of process performance and flexibility. The framework comprises three
main steps: (1) model development & problem formulation, (2) design space
identification and (3) design space analysis. For the first time, a
mathematical representation of the design space boundary is obtained and
exploited for the investigation of nominal operating points. We demonstrate how
the proposed framework can be used for the identification of acceptable
operating spaces, quantification of operational flexibility and assessment of
different operating points. The proposed framework is demonstrated on Protein A
chromatographic separation of antibody-based therapeutics from cell-derived
impurities, used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.

results test the PCW approach on in-context learning with models that range in
size between 750 million and 178 billion parameters, and show substantial
improvements for tasks with diverse input and output spaces. We show additional

the tasks of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, they suffer
from the catastrophic forgetting problem when continuously learning from
streaming data without revisiting the previously seen data. This limitation
prohibits the application of existing NIRs to scenarios where images come in
sequentially. In view of this, we explore the task of incremental learning for
NIRs in this work. We design a student-teacher framework to mitigate the
catastrophic forgetting problem. Specifically, we iterate the process of using
the student as the teacher at the end of each time step and let the teacher
guide the training of the student in the next step. As a result, the student
network is able to learn new information from the streaming data and retain old
knowledge from the teacher network simultaneously. Although intuitive, naively
applying the student-teacher pipeline does not work well in our task. Not all
information from the teacher network is helpful since it is only trained with
the old data. To alleviate this problem, we further introduce a random inquirer
and an uncertainty-based filter to filter useful information. Our proposed
method is general and thus can be adapted to different implicit representations
such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and neural SDF. Extensive experimental
results for both 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach compared to different baselines.

chiral spin structure are relevant for the development of light
helicity-sensitive THz emitters and detectors. In this paper, we report
femtosecond excitation pulse wavelength and helicity-dependent response of the
three-dimensional topological insulators for an enhanced broadband THz pulse
emission. Specifically, the excitation wavelength has been varied in a large
range from near UV to near IR and two model systems of Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 single
crystals have been studied. It was observed that the photoexcitation at shorter
wavelengths enhances the THz emission from both the surface and bulk states.
Primarily, circular photogalvanic effect is responsible for the surface
contribution, while the prominent contribution in the bulk is from photon-drag
effect. The wavelength-dependence of the THz emission is explained by
accounting for the free carrier absorption of THz radiation within the material
accurately.

quantum state of light. It has been used to detect useful non-local properties,
such as entanglement for the quantum teleportation and distillability of a
secret key in quantum key distribution. In so doing, the detection scheme
employs a bright optical pulse, called the local oscillator (LO) pulse, and the
LO pulse is usually transmitted along with the signal pulses. The LO pulse is
presumed to be a coherent state with an infinite intensity. However, it is
difficult in practice to hold this presumption owing to noise in the optical
transmission channels or an intervention by a malicious third party. As a
result, the implementation may no longer be the homodyne detection, and those
outcomes may merely disguise successful detection of entanglement or a secret
key. Here, we present an alternative scheme that works as the homodyne
detection to detect the non-local properties of light in a verifiable manner,
without any presumption for the LO pulses. This scheme is essentially based on
the same setup as the conventional implementation for the homodyne detection.
This result contributes to close any possible loophole in the homodyne
detection caused by the deviation from the ideal LO pulses.

Various causal estimands have been proposed to quantify treatment effects under
clustered interference from observational data, but these estimands either
entail treatment policies lacking real-world relevance or are based on
parametric propensity score models. Here, we propose new causal estimands based
on incremental changes to propensity scores which may be more relevant in many
contexts and are not based on parametric models. Nonparametric sample splitting
estimators of the new estimands are constructed, which allow for flexible
data-adaptive estimation of nuisance functions and are consistent,
asymptotically normal, and efficient, converging at the usual parametric rate.

discovery and identification, to linear viscoelasticity. For this case, we
perform a priori model selection by adopting a generalized Maxwell model
expressed by a Prony series, and deploy EUCLID for identification. The
methodology is based on four ingredients: i. full-field displacement and net
force data; ii. a very wide material model library - in our case, a very large
number of terms in the Prony series; iii. the linear momentum balance
constraint; iv. the sparsity constraint. The devised strategy comprises two
stages. Stage 1 relies on sparse regression; it enforces momentum balance on
the data and exploits sparsity-promoting regularization to drastically reduce
the number of terms in the Prony series and identify the material parameters.
Stage 2 relies on k-means clustering; starting from the reduced set of terms
from stage 1, it further reduces their number by grouping together Maxwell
elements with very close relaxation times and summing the corresponding moduli.
Automated procedures are proposed for the choice of the regularization
parameter in stage 1 and of the number of clusters in stage 2. The overall
strategy is demonstrated on artificial numerical data, both without and with
the addition of noise, and shown to efficiently and accurately identify a
linear viscoelastic model with five relaxation times across four orders of
magnitude, out of a library with several hundreds of terms spanning relaxation
times across seven orders of magnitude.

Therefore, it is not easy to quantify the contribution of the Umklapp

propose to explore these scattering processes separately. We study the
contribution of each scattering process in the one-dimensional Hubbard model

bosonization methods. Our kDMRG calculation confirms that the Mott charge gap
results from the Umklapp scattering, but the normal scattering processes

model the random structure in a small supercell, it is necessary to study a
large space of random configurations with respect to the nearest shells.
Mimicking the randomness with the many-body terms does not lead to significant
improvements in the formation energy but modeling the random structure with the
few nearest neighbor pairs leads to improvements in the formation energy. We
have also demonstrated the existence of weak to intermediate SRO for equimolar
compositions. Chemical ordering is studied by linking a large number of MCSQS
realizations to DFT calculations, and the SRO results are rationalized in terms
of the crystallographic structure of the element pairs and binary phase
diagrams. The formation energy of $Ti_{x}(HfNbTaZr)_{(1-x)/4}$ alloys remains
slightly positive for all $x$ when Ti is added. For $x$ > 0.5, a phase
transition in favor of an hcp structure is observed in agreement with the Bo-Md

bioamphiphiles can present chameleonic behavior, as pH and ions control their
phase diagram in water around neutrality under strongly diluted conditions (< 5
wt%). The glycolipid used in this work behaves like a surfactant (micellar
phase) at high pH or like a phospholipid (vesicle phase) at low pH. Moreover,

small Ekman number $Ek=5\times 10^{-8}$ we vary the Rayleigh number $Ra$
between $10^{11}$ and $4\times 10^{12}$ to cover various subregimes observed in
geostrophic convection. We also include one nonrotating experiment. The scaling
of the velocity fluctuations (expressed as the Reynolds number $Re$) is
compared to theoretical relations expressing balances of
viscous--Archimedean--Coriolis (VAC) and Coriolis--inertial--Archimedean (CIA)
forces. Based on our results we cannot decide which balance is most applicable
here; both scaling relations match equally well. A comparison of the current
data with several other literature datasets indicates a convergence towards
diffusion-free scaling of velocity as $Ek$ decreases. However, the use of
confined domains leads at lower $Ra$ to prominent convection in the wall mode
near the sidewall. Kinetic energy spectra point at an overall flow organisation
into a quadrupolar vortex filling the cross-section. This quadrupolar vortex is
a quasi-two-dimensional feature as it only manifests in energy spectra based on
the horizontal velocity components. At larger $Ra$ the spectra reveal the
development of a scaling range with exponent close to $-5/3$, the classical
exponent for inertial-range scaling in three-dimensional turbulence. The
steeper $Re(Ra)$ scaling at low $Ek$ and development of a scaling range in the
energy spectra are distinct indicators that a fully developed, diffusion-free
turbulent flow state is approached, sketching clear perspectives for further

Earth-orbiting satellite are planned for the near future, such as the Atomic

The increasing accuracies of the developed clocks and of the links connecting
them with ground stations impose corresponding accuracy requirements for
theoretical models of electromagnetic signal propagation through the atmosphere
of Earth and for the related time and frequency transfer corrections. We
develop a relativistic model of one- and two-way time and frequency transfer.
In addition to the gravitational effects, it also includes the effects of
atmospheric refractivity and atmospheric flows within the relativistic
framework. The model is based on an analytical solution of the equation of
motion of a light ray in spacetime filled with a medium: the null geodesic
equation of Gordon's optical metric. Explicit formulas for one- and two-way
time and frequency transfer corrections are given using realistic fields of the
gravitational potential, the refractive index, and the wind speed, taking
nonstationarity and deviations from spherical symmetry into account. Numerical
examples are provided that focus on two-way ground-to-satellite transfer, with
satellite parameters similar to those of the ISS. The effect of the atmospheric
refractive index increases as the satellite position moves from zenith to
horizon, and it is shown that the effect ranges from 0 ps to 5 ps for two-way
time transfer and from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-13}$ for two-way frequency transfer.
The effect of the wind contribution is well below 1 ps for the two-way time
transfer for normal atmospheric conditions, but for the two-way frequency

configurations of the streams' progenitors. In this paper, we study how these
morphologies can also arise in certain static, non-spherical gravitational
potentials that host a subset of resonantly-trapped orbit families. The
transitions, or separatrices, between these orbit families mark abrupt
discontinuities in the orbital structure of the potential. We develop a novel
numerical approach for measuring the libration frequencies of resonant and
near-resonant orbits, and apply it to study the evolution of stellar streams on

streams on near-resonant orbits: fans, that come about due to a large spread in
the libration frequencies near a separatrix; and bifurcations, that arise when
a separatrix splits the orbital distribution of the stellar stream between two

the impact of globally neutral configurations of external charges on the field

localized automorphisms of the universal algebra. Gauss's law implies that
these automorphisms cannot be implemented by unitary operators involving only
the electromagnetic field, they are outer automorphisms. The missing degrees of
freedom can be incorporated in an enlargement of the universal algebra, which
can concretely be represented by exponential functions of gauge fields and an
abelian algebra describing the external charges. In this manner, gauge fields
manifest themselves in the framework of gauge invariant observables. The action
of the automorphisms on the vacuum state gives rise to representations of the
electromagnetic field with vanishing global charge, which are locally disjoint
from the vacuum representation. This feature disappears in the enlarged
universal algebra of the electromagnetic field. The energy content of the
states is well defined in both cases and bounded from below. The passage from
these globally neutral states to charged states and the determination of their
energy content are also being discussed.

important task in their analysis. To account for inhomogeneities and deviations

  Aims: We present a 3D Monte Carlo code for radiative transfer modelling,
which is aimed to calculate the plasma ionisation and excitation state with the
statistical equilibrium equations, moreover, to implement photon-matter
coupling. As a first step, we present our Monte Carlo radiation transfer
routines developed and tested from scratch.
  Methods: The background model atmosphere (the temperature, density, and
velocity structure) can use an arbitrary grid referred to as the model grid
(modGrid). The radiative transfer was solved using the Monte Carlo method in a
Cartesian grid, referred to as the propagation grid (propgrid). This Cartesian
grid was created based on the structure of the modgrid; correspondence between
these two grids was set at the beginning of the calculations and then kept
fixed. The propgrid can be either regular or adaptive; two modes of adaptive
grids were tested. The accuracy and calculation speed for different propgrids
was analysed. Photon interaction with matter was handled using the Lucy's
macroatom approach. Test calculations using our code were compared with the
results obtained by a different Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.
  Results: Our method and the related code for the 3D radiative transfer using
the Monte Carlo and macroatom methods offer an accurate and reliable solution
for the radiative transfer problem, and are especially promising for the
inclusion and treatment of 3D inhomogeneities.

faulty insulators in power lines. This involves training an object detection
model from scratch, or fine tuning a model that is pre-trained on benchmark
computer vision datasets. This approach works well with a large number of
insulator images, but can result in unreliable models in the low data regime.
The current literature mainly focuses on detecting the presence or absence of
insulator caps, which is a relatively easy detection task, and does not
consider detection of finer faults such as flashed and broken disks. In this
article, we formulate three object detection tasks for insulator and asset
inspection from aerial images, focusing on incipient faults in disks. We curate
a large reference dataset of insulator images that can be used to learn robust
features for detecting healthy and faulty insulators. We study the advantage of
using this dataset in the low target data regime by pre-training on the
reference dataset followed by fine-tuning on the target dataset. The results
suggest that object detection models can be used to detect faults in insulators
at a much incipient stage, and that transfer learning adds value depending on
the type of object detection model. We identify key factors that dictate
performance in the low data-regime and outline potential approaches to improve
the state-of-the-art.

(IPF) already established for modeling and understanding musical instrument and
rhythm perception and production. It assumes the brain works with impulses,
neural bursts, ejected from an arbitrary reference point in the brain, arriving
at other reflecting brain regions, and returning to the reference point delayed
and damped. A plasticity model is suggested to adjust reflection strength in
time. The model is systematically studied with 50 reflection points by varying
the amount of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons, the presence or absence of
plasticity or external sensory input, and the strength of the input and
plasticity in terms of system adaptation to an input or to the system itself.
The Brain IPF shows adaptation to an external stimulus, which is stronger
without plasticity, showing the active brain not being a simple passive
\emph{tabula rasa}. A relation of 10-20\% of inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons,
as found in the brain, shows a maximum adaptation to an external stimulus
compared to all other relations, pointing to an optimum of this relation
concerning adaptation. When assuming strong brain periodicities only up to
about 100 Hz, the reflection strength of the model is highest for delays of
around 300 ms, corresponding to Event-Related Potential (ERP) timescales of
brain potentials most often found roughly between 100 - 400 ms. The mean
convergence times of the model correspond to short-time memory time scales with
a mean of five seconds for converging IPFs. The Brain IPF is computationally
very cheap, highly flexible, and with musical instruments already found to be
of high predictive precision. Therefore, in future studies, the Brain IPF might
be a model able to understand very large systems composed of an ensemble of
brains as well as cultural artifacts and ecological entities.

in this latter regime, a resonant-like behavior can take place for suitable

sensitive function of the cosmological parameters. To use clusters for
cosmological parameter studies, it is necessary to determine their masses as
accurately as possible, which is typically done via mass-observable scaling
relations. X-ray observables can be biased by multiphase gas and projection
effects, especially in the case where cluster temperatures and luminosities are
estimated from single-model fits to all of the emission with a given radius.
Using simulated galaxy clusters from a realistic cosmological simulation, we
seek to determine the importance of these biases in the context of
Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations of clusters. We extract clusters
from the Magneticum suite, and simulate eROSITA observations of these clusters
using PHOX and SIXTE. We compare the fitted observables from these observations
to those derived from the simulations. We fitted an intrinsically scattered
$L_{\rm X}-T$ scaling relation to these measurements following a Bayesian
approach with which we fully took into account the selection effects and the
mass function. The largest biases on the cluster observables come from the
inadequacy of single-temperature model fits to represent emission from
multiphase gas, as well as a bias arising from cluster emission within the
projected $r_{500c}$ along the line of sight but outside of the spherical
$r_{500c}$. We find that the biases on temperature and luminosity due to the
projection of emission from other clusters within $r_{500c}$ is small. We find
that our simulated clusters follow a $L_{\rm X}-T$ scaling relation that has a
broadly consistent but slightly shallower slope compared to the literature, and
that the intrinsic scatter of $L_{\rm X}$ at given T is lower compared to the
recent observational results where the selection effects are fully considered.

particles coupled to Lindblad baths. The dissipative processes, described by
linear and quadratic jump operators, are modulated by inhomogeneous couplings.
Following a semi-classical approach, we find the differential equation
governing the Wigner function evolution, which can be solved in closed form in
some particular cases. We check the accuracy of the Wigner approach in
different scenarios (i.e. Gaussian jump rates), describing the density
evolution and the transport phenomena in terms of classical quasi-particles.

significant popularity. While reasoning over temporally connected atomic
actions is mundane for intelligent species, standard artificial neural networks
(ANN) still struggle to classify them. In the real world, atomic actions often
temporally connect to form more complex composite actions. The challenge lies
in recognising composite action of varying durations while other distinct
composite or atomic actions occur in the background. Drawing upon the success
of relational networks, we propose methods that learn to reason over the
semantic concept of objects and actions. We empirically show how ANNs benefit
from pretraining, relational inductive biases and unordered set-based latent
representations. In this paper we propose deep set conditioned I3D (SCI3D), a
two stream relational network that employs latent representation of state and
visual representation for reasoning over events and actions. They learn to
reason about temporally connected actions in order to identify all of them in
the video. The proposed method achieves an improvement of around 1.49% mAP in
atomic action recognition and 17.57% mAP in composite action recognition, over
a I3D-NL baseline, on the CATER dataset.

the digitization thresholds. Custom-developed software is used to process the
acquired data, making it available within $\mathcal{O}\left(10\text{ s}\right)$

chemical reaction networks. Essentially, every nonnegative ODE model used in
chemistry and biology (for example, in ecology and epidemiology) and even in
economics and engineering can be written in this form. Previous results have
focused on existence and uniqueness of special steady states (complex-balanced
equilibria) for all rate constants, thereby ruling out multiple (special)
steady states. Recently, necessary conditions for linear stability have been
obtained.
  In this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the linear stability of
complex-balanced equilibria for all rate constants (and also for the
non-existence of other steady states). In particular, via sign-vector
conditions (on the stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic orders), we
guarantee that the Jacobian matrix is a $P$-matrix. Technically, we use a new
decomposition of the graph Laplacian which allows to consider orders of
(generalized) monomials. Alternatively, we use cycle decomposition which allows
a linear parametrization of all Jacobian matrices. In any case, we guarantee
stability without explicit computation of steady states. We illustrate our
results in examples from chemistry and biology: generalized Lotka-Volterra
systems and SIR models, a two-component signaling system, and an enzymatic
futile cycle.

consequence of the nonperturbative treatment of molecular systems in a magnetic

compared against the quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP). Each molecule has
three semi-classical modes owing to the hydrogen - two precession modes that
are degenerate in the absence of a field and one stretching mode. The NEO-TDHF

study the dependence of the frequencies of the fundamental (f), interfacial

find that the frequencies of the i- and s-modes depend sensitively on the size
of the core, while the frequency of the f-mode is affected only slightly by at

tidal deformability of crystallized white dwarfs and find that the effect of
crystallization becomes significant only when the radius of the core is larger
than about 70% of the stellar radius. The tidal deformability can change by a
few to about 10 percent when a white dwarf becomes fully crystallized. We also
show that there exist approximate equation-of-state insensitive relations

frequency for pure fluid white dwarfs. Depending on the stellar mass and
composition, however, these relations can be affected by a few percent when the

describing the underlying process. While process models can be represented in a
variety of ways, Petri nets form a theoretically well-explored description
language and are therefore often used in process mining. In this paper, we
present an extension of the eST-Miner process discovery algorithm. The
eST-Miner computes a set of Petri net places which are considered to be fitting
with respect to a certain fraction of the behavior described by the given event
log as indicated by a given noise threshold. It evaluates all possible
candidate places using token-based replay. The set of replayable traces is
determined for each place in isolation, i.e., these sets do not need to be
consistent. This allows the algorithm to abstract from infrequent behavioral
patterns occuring only in some traces. When combining these places into a Petri
net by connecting them to the corresponding uniquely labeled transitions, the
resulting net can replay exactly those traces from the event log that are
allowed by the combination of all inserted places. Thus, inserting places
one-by-one without considering their combined effect may result in deadlocks
and low fitness of the Petri net. In this paper, we explore adaptions of the
eST-Miner, that aim to select a subset of places such that the resulting Petri
net guarantees a definable minimal fitness while maintaining high precision
with respect to the input event log. Furthermore, current place evaluation

wave height (Hs) over time, for output of WAVEWATCHIII models from 7
representative CMIP5 GCMs, and the FIO-ESM v2.0 CMIP6 GCM, for neighbourhoods
of locations east of Madagascar and south of Australia. Non-stationary extreme
value analysis of peaks-over-threshold and block maxima using Bayesian
inference provide posterior estimates of return values as a function of time;
MATLAB software is provided. There is large variation between return value
estimates from different GCMs, and with longitude and latitude within each
neighbourhood. These sources of uncertainty tend to be larger than that due to
typical modelling choices (such as choice of threshold for POT, or block length
for BM). However, careful threshold and block length are critical east of
Madagascar, because of the presence of a mixed population of storms there. The
long 700-year pre-industrial control (piControl) output of the CMIP6 GCM allows
quantification of the apparent inherent variability in return value as a
function of time.

rules for the next-step modalities that are sufficiently well-behaved in a
formally defined sense; in particular, rule matches need to be representable by
polynomial-sized codes, and the sequent duals of the rules need to absorb cut.
While such rule sets have been identified for some important cases, they are
not known to exist in all cases of interest, in particular ones involving
either integer weights as in the graded $\mu$-calculus, or real-valued weights
in combination with non-linear arithmetic. In the present work, we prove the

of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Specifically, our focus is on
analyzing the spatial multiplexing gains in line-of-sight and low-scattering
MIMO channels in the near field. We prove that the channel capacity is achieved
by diagonalizing the end-to-end transmitter-RIS-receiver channel, and applying
the water-filling power allocation to the ordered product of the singular
values of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels. The obtained
capacity-achieving solution requires an RIS with a non-diagonal matrix of
reflection coefficients. Under the assumption of nearly-passive RIS, i.e., no
power amplification is needed at the RIS, the water-filling power allocation is
necessary only at the transmitter. We refer to this design of RIS as a linear,
nearly-passive, reconfigurable electromagnetic object (EMO). In addition, we
introduce a closed-form and low-complexity design for RIS, whose matrix of
reflection coefficients is diagonal with unit-modulus entries. The reflection
coefficients are given by the product of two focusing functions: one steering
the RIS-aided signal towards the mid-point of the MIMO transmitter and one
steering the RIS-aided signal towards the mid-point of the MIMO receiver. We
prove that this solution is exact in line-of-sight channels under the paraxial
setup. With the aid of extensive numerical simulations in line-of-sight
(free-space) channels, we show that the proposed approach offers performance
(rate and degrees of freedom) close to that obtained by numerically solving
non-convex optimization problems at a high computational complexity. Also, we
show that it provides performance close to that achieved by the EMO
(non-diagonal RIS) in most of the considered case studies.

degrees of freedom attract a great attention. In this work, we consider the
transient dynamics of the system consisting of strongly coupled vibron and
exciton driven by external monochromatic field. We show that under coherent
pumping, polarization of exciton exhibits complex quantum dynamics which can be
divided into three stages. At the first stage, exciton oscillations at its
eigenfrequency relax due to the transition to set of shifted Fock states of
vibrons. We demonstrate that these shifted Fock states play the role of an
effective reservoir for the excited exciton state. The time of relaxation to
this reservoir depends on exciton-vibron coupling. At the second stage,
excitation, transferred to the reservoir of the vibronic shifted states at the
first stage, returns into electronic degrees of freedom and revival of
oscillations at exciton eigenfrequency appears. Thus, the dynamics of molecular
polarization exhibit collapses and revivals. At the final stage, these
collapses and revivals dissipate and polarization exhibits Rayleigh response at
the frequency of the external field. Discovered collapses and revivals manifest
in radiation spectrum as multiple splitting of the spectral line near the
exciton transition frequency.

rare. The quasiparticle disappearance becomes easier with an increase in: (i)
the total number of bosons with zero energy, and (ii) the relative strength of

performs projective measurement on the sequentially prepared state for $K$

rounds of random sampled unitary. As a result, there are $MK$ times
measurements in total. Here we analyze the performance of shadow estimation in
this multi-shot scenario, which is characterized by the variance of estimating
the expectation value of some observable $O$. We find that in addition to the
shadow-norm $\|O \|_{\mathrm{shadow}}$ introduced in [Huang
et.al.~Nat.~Phys.~2020\cite{huang2020predicting}], the variance is also related
to another norm, and we denote it as the cross-shadow-norm $\|O

analyze and show the upper bounds of $\|O \|_{\mathrm{Xshadow}}$. In
particular, we figure out the exact variance formula for Pauli observable under

report the stabilization of ultrathin out-of-plane ferroelectricity in oxide

Inserting an in-plane polarized ferroelectric epitaxial buffer provides
continuity of polarization at the interface, and despite its insulating nature
we observe the emergence of polarization in our out-of-plane-polarized model
ferroelectric BaTiO$_{3}$ from the very first unit cell. In BiFeO$_{3}$, the
flux-closure approach stabilizes a conceptually novel 251$^{\circ}$ domain
wall. Its unusual chirality is likely associated with the ferroelectric analog
to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We thus see that in an adaptively

combines a causal continuous-depth neural network model with a cooperation

profiles are obtained by computing the networks' saliency maps (feature
importance) through the VisualBackProp algorithm. The guardian agent is trained
via reinforcement learning in a fixed-wing aircraft simulated environment. When
the attention profile of the pilot and guardian agents align, the pilot makes
control decisions. If the attention map of the pilot and the guardian do not
align, the air-guardian makes interventions and takes over the control of the
aircraft. We show that our attention-based air-guardian system can balance the
trade-off between its level of involvement in the flight and the pilot's

learning and neural networks. Although many researchers appreciate and know how
to apply AD, it remains a challenge to truly understand the underlying
processes. From an algebraic point of view, however, AD appears surprisingly
natural: it originates from the differentiation laws. In this work we use
Algebra of Programming techniques to reason about different AD variants,
leveraging Haskell to illustrate our observations. Our findings stem from three
fundamental algebraic abstractions: (1) the notion of module over a semiring,
(2) Nagata's construction of the 'idealization of a module', and (3)
Kronecker's delta function, that together allow us to write a single-line
abstract definition of AD. From this single-line definition, and by
instantiating our algebraic structures in various ways, we derive different AD
variants, that have the same extensional behaviour, but different intensional
properties, mainly in terms of (asymptotic) computational complexity. We show
the different variants equivalent by means of Kronecker isomorphisms, a further
elaboration of our Haskell infrastructure which guarantees correctness by
construction. With this framework in place, this paper seeks to make AD

interpreted as D1-F1-D3 line defects within this CFT. Switching off the
D7-branes, we act with $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$ to construct a second family
of solutions that can be related to an $\text{AdS}_3\times S^3\times S^3$ class
of M-theory backgrounds describing surface defects within the six dimensional

their M-theory origin.

Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 3 and Band 6 together with
synthetic continuum maps from numerical simulations with Bifrost at the same
bands to carry out a detailed study of bright small-scale magnetic features. To
this end, we have used an algorithm to automatically identify and trace the
features within the field of view (FoV) of the observations and the simulation.
We found 193 and 293 features in the Bands 3 and 6 observations, respectively.
In the degraded simulation, the total number of features were 24 for Band 3 and
204 for Band 6. In the original simulation, the total number of features were
36 for Band 3 and 392 for Band 6. Based on the simulation, we confirm the
magnetic nature of the features which exhibit an oscillatory behaviour in
temperature, size and horizontal velocity. The average oscillation periods were
of 30-99\,s for temperature, 37-92\,s for size and 37-78\,s for horizontal
velocity. There are indications for the possible presence of transverse (kink)
waves with average amplitude velocities of 2.1-5.0\,km\,s$^{-1}$. An anti-phase
behaviour between temperature and size oscillations suggest the presence of
compressible fast-sausage Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modes. Finally, we have
estimated the flux of energy of the fast-sausage waves at the chromospheric
heights sampled by ALMA as 453-1838\,W\,m$^{-2}$ for Band 3 and
3640-5485\,W\,m$^{-2}$ for Band 6. The decrease of wave energy-flux with height
(from Band 6 to Band 3) could possibly suggest energy dissipation at
chromospheric heights, thus wave heating, with the assumptions that the
identified small-scale waves are typical at each band and they propagate upward
through the chromosphere.

  computation & polynomiality properties","31 pages, 17 figures",,,,"math.AG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Counts of curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ with fixed contact order
with the toric boundary and satisfying point conditions can be determined with
tropical methods by Mikhalkin. If we require that our curves intersect the
zero- and infinity-section only in points of contact order $1$, but allow
arbitrary contact order for the zero- and infinity-fiber, the corresponding
numbers reveal beautiful structural properties such as piecewise polynomiality,
similar to the case of double Hurwitz numbers counting covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$
with special ramification profiles over zero and infinity by Ardila and
Brugall\'e. This result was obtained using the floor diagram method to count
tropical curves.
  Here, we expand the tropical tools to determine counts of curves in
$\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. We provide a computational tool (building on
Polymake by Gawrilow and Joswig) that determines such numbers of tropical
curves for any genus and any contact orders via a straightforward
generalization of Mikhalkin's lattice path algorithm. The tool can also be used
for other toric surfaces. To enable efficient computations also by hand, we
introduce a new counting tool (for the case of rational curves with transverse
contacts with the infinity section) which can be seen as a combination of the
floor diagram and the lattice path approach: subfloor diagrams. We use both our
computational tool and the subfloor diagrams for experiments revealing
structural properties of these counts.
  We obtain first results on the (piecewise) polynomial structure of counts of
rational curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ with arbitrary contact
orders on the zero- and infinity-fiber and restricted choices for the contact
orders on the zero- and infinity-section.

missions deals with understanding how electrons in the lower solar corona are
accelerated and how they subsequently access interplanetary space. We aim to
investigate the electron acceleration and energy release sites as well as the
manner in which accelerated electrons access the interplanetary space in the
case of the SOL2021-02-18T18:05 event, a GOES A8 class microflare associated
with a coronal jet. This study takes advantage of three different vantage
points, Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Earth, with observations ranging from
radio to X-ray. Multi-wavelength timing analysis combined with UV/EUV imagery
and X-ray spectroscopy by Solar Orbiter/STIX (Spectrometer/Telescope for
Imaging X-rays) is used to investigate the origin of the observed emission
during different flare phases. The event under investigation satisfies the
classical picture of the onset time of the acceleration of electrons coinciding
with the jet and the radio type III bursts. This microflare features prominent
hard X-ray nonthermal emission down to at least 10 keV and a spectrum that is
much harder than usual for a microflare with a spectral index of 2.9. From
Earth's vantage point, the microflare is seen near the limb, revealing the
coronal energy release site above the flare loop in EUV, which, from STIX
spectroscopic analysis, turns out to be hot (at roughly the same temperature of
the flare). Moreover, this region is moving toward higher altitudes over time
(about 30 km/s). During the flare, the same region spatially coincides with the
origin of the coronal jet. We conclude that the energy release site observed
above-the-loop corresponds to the electron acceleration site, corroborating
that interchange reconnection is a viable candidate for particle acceleration
in the low corona on field lines open to interplanetary space.

Updated to match published version",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quasars observed at redshifts $z\sim 6-7.5$ are powered by supermassive black
holes which are too large to have grown from early stellar remnants without
efficient super-Eddington accretion. A proposal for alleviating this tension is
for dust and metal-free gas clouds to have undergone a process of direct
collapse, producing black hole seeds of mass $M_\textrm{seed}\sim10^5 M_\odot$
around redshift $z \sim 17$. For direct collapse to occur, a large flux of UV
photons must exist to photodissociate molecular hydrogen, allowing the gas to
cool slowly and avoid fragmentation. We investigate the possibility of sub-keV
mass dark matter decaying or annihilating to produce the UV flux needed to
cause direct collapse. We find that annihilating dark matter with a mass in the
range of $13.6 \textrm{ eV} \le m_{dm} \le 20 \textrm{ eV}$ can produce the
required flux while avoiding existing constraints. A non-thermally produced
dark matter particle which comprises the entire dark matter abundance requires
a thermally averaged cross section of $\langle\sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-35}$
cm$^3/$s. Alternatively, the flux could originate from a thermal relic which
comprises only a fraction $\sim10^{-9}$ of the total dark matter density.
Decaying dark matter models which are unconstrained by independent
astrophysical observations are unable to sufficiently suppress molecular
hydrogen, except in gas clouds embedded in dark matter halos which are larger,
cuspier, or more concentrated than current simulations predict. Lastly, we
explore how our results could change with the inclusion of full
three-dimensional effects. Notably, we demonstrate that if the $\mathrm{H}_2$
self-shielding is less than the conservative estimate used in this work, the
range of both annihilating and decaying dark matter models which can cause
direct collapse is significantly increased.

historically high levels. In the same time, the landscape of hybrid threats is
expanding; new forms of hybrid threats create different types of uncertainties.
This paper aims to understand the potential consequences of uncertain events -
like natural disasters, pandemics, hybrid and/or military aggression - on GSC
resilience and robustness. Leveraging a parsimonious supply chain model, we
analyse how the organisational structure of GSCs interacts with uncertainty,
and how risk-aversion vs. ambiguity-aversion, vertical integration vs. upstream
outsourcing, resilience vs. efficiency trade-offs drive a wedge between
decentralised and centralised optimal GSC diversification strategies in
presence of externalities. Parameterising the scalable data model with
World-Input Output Tables, we simulate the survival probability of a GSC and
implications for supply chain robustness and resilience. The presented
model-based simulations provide an interoperable and directly comparable
conceptualisation of positive and normative effects of counterfactual
resilience and robustness policy choices under individually optimal
(decentralised) and socially optimal (centralised) GSC organisation structures.

so far have met problems, including catastrophic forgetting, interference among

research has focused on learning multiple input distributions, typically in
classification, lifelong reinforcement learning (LRL) must also deal with
variations in the state and transition distributions, and in the reward
functions. Modulating masks, recently developed for classification, are
particularly suitable to deal with such a large spectrum of task variations. In
this paper, we adapted modulating masks to work with deep LRL, specifically PPO
and IMPALA agents. The comparison with LRL baselines in both discrete and
continuous RL tasks shows superior performance. We further investigated the use
of a linear combination of previously learned masks to exploit previous
knowledge when learning new tasks: not only is learning faster, the algorithm
solves tasks that we could not otherwise solve from scratch due to extremely
sparse rewards. The results suggest that RL with modulating masks is a
promising approach to lifelong learning, to the composition of knowledge to
learn increasingly complex tasks, and to knowledge reuse for efficient and

pose significant numerical challenges. Although monolithic approaches offer
possibly the best solution strategy, they often require ad-hoc preconditioners
and numerical implementations. Sequential (also known as splitted, partitioned
or segregated) approaches are iterative methods for solving coupled problems
where each equation is solved independently and the coupling is achieved
through iterations. These methods offer the possibility to flexibly add or
remove equations from a model and to rely on existing black-box solvers for
every specific equation. Furthermore, when problems are non-linear, inner
iterations need to be performed even in monolithic solvers, therefore making a
sequential iterative approach a viable alternative. The cost of running inner
iterations to achieve the coupling, however, could easily becomes prohibitive,
or, in some cases the iterations might not converge. In this work we present a
general formulation of splitting schemes for continuous operators, with
arbitrary implicit/explicit splitting, like in standard iterative methods for
linear systems. By introducing a generic relaxation operator we find the
conditions for the convergence of the iterative schemes. We show how the
relaxation operator can be thought as a preconditioner and constructed based on
an approximate Schur-complement. We propose a Schur-based Partial Jacobi
relaxation operator to stabilise the coupling and show its effectiveness.
Although we mainly focus on scalar-scalar linear problems, most results are
easily extended to non-linear and higher-dimensional problems. Numerical tests
(1D and 2D) for two PDE systems, namely the Dual-Porosity model and a
Quad-Laplacian operator, are carried out to confirm the theoretical results.

in order to be a driver for a neutrino experiment. Coupling the high flux
generated by the IsoDAR system with a kiloton neutrino detector will provide
sterile neutrino exclusion searches covering anomalous regions indicated by
short baseline experiments. Simultaneously, the coupling of a high power target
and kiloton detector allows for the investigation of dark matter candidates,
namely axion-like particles. We have shown that nuclear excitations within the
IsoDAR target create a unique opportunity to produce axions and detect
monoenergetic peaks with the nearby kiloton detector. Beyond this, the high
power produced by the IsoDAR cyclotron can be used for applications beyond
particle physics. The IsoDAR cyclotron accelerates and extracts H$_2^+$, which
allows the beam to be split downstream, a versatile and important development
to alleviate the problem of producing high-power targets for the medical
isotope community. This thesis presents a proposal for production of an more
than an order of magnitude higher rates than are available at present for
certain highly-need medical isotopes, including Ac-225.
  In this thesis, we report results from a multi-cusp ion source that meets
these requirements and produces a record level of high purity, low emittance
H$_2^+$ current. The second has been to design a radio-frequency quadrupole
(RFQ) that will allow for gentle bunching of the high current before injection.
This is the first use of axial direct injection with a compact cyclotron. This
thesis reports the first application of machine learning to the RFQ design.
These tools enable the high currents required by IsoDAR cyclotron, leading to
important impact on the accelerator, medical, and physics communities.

in vision tasks, has pivoted against the widespread convolutional paradigm.
Relying on the tokenization process that splits inputs into multiple tokens,
transformers are capable of extracting their pairwise relationships using
self-attention. While being the stemming building block of transformers, what
makes for a good tokenizer has not been well understood in computer vision. In
this work, we investigate this uncharted problem from an information trade-off
perspective. In addition to unifying and understanding existing structural
modifications, our derivation leads to better design strategies for vision
tokenizers. The proposed Modulation across Tokens (MoTo) incorporates
inter-token modeling capability through normalization. Furthermore, a
regularization objective TokenProp is embraced in the standard training regime.
Through extensive experiments on various transformer architectures, we observe
both improved performance and intriguing properties of these two plug-and-play
designs with negligible computational overhead. These observations further
indicate the importance of the commonly-omitted designs of tokenizers in vision
transformer.

gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we first investigate the parameter
estimation of eccentric GWs with decihertz observatory. We consider two
scenarios for the configuration of DECIGO, i.e., the one cluster of DECIGO with
its design sensitivity and B-DECIGO which also has one cluster but with
inferior sensitivity as a comparison. We adopt the Fisher matrix to estimate
the parameter errors. By mocking up the typical binaries in GWTC-3, we find a
nonvanishing eccentricity can significantly improve the estimation for almost
all waveform parameters. In particular, the localization of typical binary
black holes (BBH) can achieve $\mathcal{O}(10-10^{3.5})$ factors of improvement
when the initial eccentricity $e_0=0.4$ at 0.1 Hz. The precise localization of
binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star--black hole binaries (NSBH),
together with the large improvement of localization of BBH from eccentricity in
the mid-band, inspire us to construct the catalogs of golden dark sirens whose
host galaxies can be uniquely identified. We find that with only one cluster of
DECIGO running 1 year in its design sensitivity, hundreds of golden dark BNS,
NSBH, and tens of golden dark BBH can be observed. Eccentricity can greatly
increase the population of golden dark BBH from $\sim 7~(e_0=0)$ to $\sim
65~(e_0=0.2)$. Such an increase of population of golden dark BBH events can
improve the precision of Hubble constant measurement from 2.06\% to 0.68\%,
matter density parameter from 64\% to 16\% in $\Lambda$CDM model. Through the
phenomenological parameterization of GW propagation, the constraints of
modified gravity can be improved from 6.2\% to 1.6\%. Our results show the
remarkable significance of eccentricity for the detection and parameter
estimation of GW events, allowing us to probe the Universe precisely.

in the process of model transmission and deployment, there are security issues,
i.e. AI model leakage due to the unreliable transmission environments and
illegal abuse at local devices without permission. Although existing works
study the intellectual property (IP) protection of AI models, they mainly focus
on the watermark-based and encryption-based methods and have the following
problems: (i) The watermark-based methods only provide passive verification
afterward rather than active protection. (ii) Encryption-based methods are low
efficiency in computation and low security in key storage. (iii) The existing
methods are not device-bind without the ability to avoid illegal abuse of AI
models. To deal with these problems, we propose a device-bind and
key-storageless hardware AI model IP protection mechanism. First, a physical
unclonable function (PUF) and permute-diffusion encryption-based AI model
protection framework is proposed, including the PUF-based secret key generation
and the geometric-value transformation-based weights encryption. Second, we
design a PUF-based key generation protocol, where delay-based Anderson PUF is
adopted to generate the derive-bind secret key. Besides, convolutional coding
and convolutional interleaving technologies are combined to improve the
stability of PUF-based key generation and reconstruction. Third, a permute and
diffusion-based intelligent model weights encryption/decryption method is
proposed to achieve effective IP protection, where chaos theory is utilized to
convert the PUF-based secret key to encryption/decryption keys. Finally,
experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
intelligent model IP protection mechanism.

longer timescales while still capturing the local aspects that make it sound
``realistic'' or ``human-like'' is still challenging. This is due to the large
computational requirements needed to work with long sequences of data, and also
to limitations imposed by the training schemes that are often employed. In this
paper, we propose a generative model of symbolic music conditioned by data
retrieved from human sentiment. The model is a Transformer-GAN trained with
labels that correspond to different configurations of the valence and arousal

tackle both of the problems above by employing an efficient linear version of

Normalization techniques are essential for accelerating training and improving

KullbackLeibler(KL) Regularized normalization (KL-Norm) which make the

recordings. These solutions are often based on Audio Fingerprinting, and rely
more specifically on the extraction of spectral peaks in order to be robust to
a number of distortions. Few works have been done to study the robustness of
these algorithms to background noise captured in real environments. In
particular, AFP systems still struggle when the signal to noise ratio is low,
i.e when the background noise is strong. In this project, we tackle this
problematic with Deep Learning. We test a new hybrid strategy which consists of
inserting a denoising DL model in front of a peak-based AFP algorithm. We
simulate noisy music recordings using a realistic data augmentation pipeline,
and train a DL model to denoise them. The denoising model limits the impact of
background noise on the AFP system's extracted peaks, improving its robustness
to noise. We further propose a novel loss function to adapt the DL model to the
considered AFP system, increasing its precision in terms of retrieved spectral
peaks. To the best of our knowledge, this hybrid strategy has not been tested
before.

implementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.
To date, most of the reported diffractive neural networks focus on single or
multiple tasks that do not involve interaction with the environment, such as
object recognition and image classification. In contrast, the networks that can

diffractive neural networks that imitate human-level decision-making and
control capability. Such networks allow for finding optimal control policies
through interaction with the environment and can be readily realized with the
dielectric metasurfaces. The superior performances of these networks are
verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe, Super Mario

diffractive neural networks, which promises a fundamental shift from the
target-driven control of a pre-designed state for simple recognition or

solution by applying code vectorization to the monolith, using the

by extending the sequence of accesses approach with vectorization of the

strategies with the sequence of accesses strategy and an existing approach that
uses class vectorization. We run all these strategies over a large set of
codebases, and then compare the results of their decompositions in terms of

Next, we propose a scene-aware pose estimation network that projects the 2D

nonlinear non-autonomous systems from noisy and sparse data. We propose and
analyze an objective function derived from a Bayesian formulation for learning
a hidden Markov model with stochastic dynamics. We then analyze this objective
function in the context of several state-of-the-art approaches for both linear
and nonlinear system ID. In the former, we analyze least squares approaches for
Markov parameter estimation, and in the latter, we analyze the multiple
shooting approach. We demonstrate the limitations of the optimization problems
posed by these existing methods by showing that they can be seen as special
cases of the proposed optimization objective under certain simplifying
assumptions: conditional independence of data and zero model error.
Furthermore, we observe that our proposed approach has improved smoothness and
inherent regularization that make it well-suited for system ID and provide
mathematical explanations for these characteristics' origins. Finally,
numerical simulations demonstrate a mean squared error over 8.7 times lower
compared to multiple shooting when data are noisy and/or sparse. Moreover, the
proposed approach can identify accurate and generalizable models even when
there are more parameters than data or when the underlying system exhibits
chaotic behavior.

be evaluated at any coordinate, admit calculation of exact derivatives, and are
conceptually simple? Existing MLP-based architectures generate worse samples
than the grid-based generators with favorable convolutional inductive biases.
Models that focus on generating images at different scales do better, but
employ complex architectures not designed for continuous evaluation of images
and derivatives. We take a signal-processing perspective and treat continuous
image generation as interpolation from samples. Indeed, correctly sampled
discrete images contain all information about the low spatial frequencies. The
question is then how to extrapolate the spectrum in a data-driven way while
meeting the above design criteria. Our answer is FunkNN -- a new convolutional
network which learns how to reconstruct continuous images at arbitrary
coordinates and can be applied to any image dataset. Combined with a discrete
generative model it becomes a functional generator which can act as a prior in
continuous ill-posed inverse problems. We show that FunkNN generates
high-quality continuous images and exhibits strong out-of-distribution
performance thanks to its patch-based design. We further showcase its
performance in several stylized inverse problems with exact spatial
derivatives.

displacement in experiments bridging the gap between the classical and quantum
domain. Dynamics of these stochastic systems is inherently determined by the
interplay between acting external forces, viscous dissipation, and random
driving by the thermal environment. The importance of inertia then dictates
that both position and momentum must, in principle, be known to fully describe
the system, which makes its quantitative experimental characterization rather
challenging. We introduce a general method of Bayesian inference of the force
field and environmental parameters in stochastic inertial systems that operates
solely on the time series of recorded noisy positions of the system. The method
is first validated on simulated trajectories of model stochastic harmonic and
anharmonic oscillators with damping. Subsequently, the method is applied to
experimental trajectories of particles levitating in tailored optical fields
and used to characterize the dynamics of particle motion in a nonlinear Duffing
potential, a static or time-dependent double-well potential, and a
non-conservative force field. The presented inference procedure does not make
any simplifying assumptions about the nature or symmetry of the acting force
field and provides robust results with trajectories two orders of magnitude
shorter than those typically required by alternative inference schemes. In
addition to being a powerful tool for quantitative data analysis, it can also
guide experimentalists in choosing appropriate sampling frequency (at least 20
measured points per single characteristic period) and length of the measured
trajectories (at least 10 periods) to estimate the force field and
environmental characteristics with a desired accuracy and precision.

primarily focused on Virtual Assistance in Natural Language Processing. Natural
Language Processing is a form of AI that helps machines understand people and
create feedback loops. This project will use deep learning to create a Voice
Recognizer and use Commonvoice and data collected from the local community for
model training using Google Colaboratory. After recognizing a command, the AI
assistant will be able to perform the most suitable actions and then give a
response.
  The motivation for this project comes from the race and gender bias that
exists in many virtual assistants. The computer industry is primarily dominated
by the male gender, and because of this, many of the products produced do not
regard women. This bias has an impact on natural language processing. This
project will be utilizing various open-source projects to implement machine
learning algorithms and train the assistant algorithm to recognize different
types of voices, accents, and dialects. Through this project, the goal to use
voice data from underrepresented groups to build a voice assistant that can
recognize voices regardless of gender, race, or accent. Increasing the
representation of women in the computer industry is important for the future of
the industry. By representing women in the initial study of voice assistants,
it can be shown that females play a vital role in the development of this
technology. In line with related work, this project will use first-hand data
from the college population and middle-aged adults to train voice assistant to
combat gender bias.

chaotic regions is the responsible to give birth to the neuronal bursting
regime. Normally, an orbit in this chaotic region cannot pass through the
transient chaotic one and reach the other chaotic region. As a consequence the
burstings are short in time. Here, we propose a control technique to connect
both chaotic regions and allow the neuron to exhibit very long burstings. This
control method defines a region Q covering the transient chaotic region where
it is possible to find an advantageous set $S \in Q$ through which the orbits
can be driven with a minimal control. In addition we show how the set S changes
depending on the noise intensity affecting the map, and how the set S can be
used in different scenarios of control.

actually use those capabilities in performing real-life tasks. In this work, we
formulate task-oriented cognitive capabilities, which are human-like cognitive
capabilities that language models leverage to perform tasks. These capabilities
are (i) the ability to quickly generate good candidate utterances (the search
capability) (ii) the ability to predict how a listener interprets those
utterances and choose the most appropriate one (the pragmatic capability). We
design an evaluation scheme for comparing these capabilities of a language
model with those of a human. Applying this scheme to examine various models in
a navigation instruction generation problem, we find that their pragmatic
capability is severely lacking. This insight leads us to augment them with
better models of the listener and obtain a significant boost of 11% in success
rate in guiding real humans. Our work advocates for having a principled
procedure for aligning language models with humans that involves (i)
formulating task-oriented capabilities, (ii) devising a method to quantify
their deficiency, and (iii) iteratively improving them.

analyse specific Creative-Ai cases, and then conduct a speculation that takes
Jacques Attali's writing on the role of music in society as a vantage point,

where pairs of tokens are exchanged subject to a fee that is proportional to
the size of transactions. At the time of writing, there exist more than 6,000
pools associated with Uniswap v3, implying that empirical investigations on the
full ecosystem can easily become computationally expensive. Thus, we propose a
systematic workflow to extract and analyse a meaningful but computationally
tractable sub-universe of liquidity pools. Leveraging on the 34 pools found
relevant for the six-months time window January-June 2022, we then investigate
the related liquidity consumption behaviour of market participants. We propose
to represent each liquidity taker by a suitably constructed transaction graph,
which is a fully connected network where nodes are the liquidity taker's
executed transactions, and edges contain weights encoding the time elapsed
between any two transactions. We extend the NLP-inspired graph2vec algorithm to
the weighted undirected setting, and employ it to obtain an embedding of the
set of graphs. This embedding allows us to extract seven clusters of liquidity
takers, with equivalent behavioural patters and interpretable trading
preferences. We conclude our work by testing for relationships between the
characteristic mechanisms of each pool, i.e. liquidity provision, consumption,
and price variation. We introduce a related ideal crypto law, inspired from the
ideal gas law of thermodynamics, and demonstrate that pools adhering to this
law are healthier trading venues in terms of sensitivity of liquidity and
agents' activity. Regulators and practitioners could benefit from our model by
developing related pool health monitoring tools.

equation allows the modeling of more complex behavior than its autonomous
analog, such as a tumor's varying growth rate under treatment, or the expansion
of bacterial colonies under varying resource conditions. Some of the most
commonly used numerical solvers produce vastly different approximations for a
non-autonomous logistic model with a periodically-varying growth rate changing
signum. Incorrect, inconsistent, or even unstable approximate solutions for
this non-autonomous problem can occur from some of the most frequently used
numerical methods, including the lsoda, implicit backwards difference, and
Runge-Kutta methods, all of which employ a black-box framework. Meanwhile, a
simple, manually-programmed Runge-Kutta method is robust enough to accurately
capture the analytical solution for biologically reasonable parameters and
consistently produce reliable simulations. Consistency and reliability of
numerical methods are fundamental for simulating non-autonomous differential
equations and dynamical systems, particularly when applications are physically

model of two resonantly interacting modes, when one is pumped and the other
dissipates. We show how to present correlation functions of interest as part of
a sum-of-squares polynomial using the stationarity of the statistics. That
allows us to find how the moments of the mode amplitudes depend on the degree
of non-equilibrium (analog of the Reynolds number), which reveals some
properties of marginal statistical distributions. By combining scaling
dependence with the results of direct numerical simulations, we obtain the
probability densities of both modes in a highly intermittent inverse cascade.
We also show that the relative phase between modes tends to $\pi/2$ and
$-\pi/2$ in the direct and inverse cascades as the Reynolds number tends to
infinity, and derive bounds on the phase variance. Our approach combines
computer-aided analytical proofs with a numerical algorithm applied to
high-degree polynomials.
