harmonic superspace approach are outlined. The crucial merit of this
formulation consists in that the relevant off-shell supermultiplets, in
particular ${\cal N}=2, 4D$ superconformal Weyl multiplet, are accommodated by
the harmonic-analytic unconstrained prepotentials with a clear geometric
meaning, like in the analogous formulation of ${\cal N}=2, 4D$ supersymmetric
gauge theory. The fundamental gauge group of conformal supergravity is
constituted by the analyticity-preserving diffeomorphisms of harmonic
superspace. The superfield actions of various off-shell versions of ${\cal
N}=2$ Einstein supergravity are obtained as the actions of the appropriate
harmonic analytic compensators in the background of conformal ${\cal N}=2$
supergravity. The version admitting the most general couplings to
quaternion-K\""ahler matter is the ``principal'' version with the unconstrained
harmonic analytic hypermultiplet superfield as a compensator. It involves an
infinite number of auxiliary fields.

can propagate and affect other vehicles. If the disturbances do not amplify
along the vehicular string, then it is called string stable. However, it is
usually difficult to achieve string stability with a distributed control
setting, especially when a constant spacing policy is considered. This note
considers the string unstable cases and studies disturbance propagation in a
nonlinear vehicular platoon consisting of $n+1$ vehicles where the (virtual)
leading vehicle provides the reference for a constant spacing policy. Apart
from the communications between consecutive vehicles, we also assume that each
vehicle can receive information from $r$ neighbors ahead, that is, the
vehicular platoon has communication range $r$. For the maximal overshoot of the
inter-vehicular spacing errors, we explicitly show that the effect of
disturbances, including the external disturbances acting on each vehicle and
the acceleration of the leading vehicle, is scaled by $O(\sqrt{ \left \lceil
\frac{n}{r} \right \rceil})$ for a fixed $n$. This implies that disturbance
propagation can be reduced by increasing communication range. Numerical
simulation is provided to illustrate the main results.

reusing the cluster operators from previous calculations in that way, it is

fluctuations of the hypercharge are investigated when the evolution of the

framework the travelling waves associated with the quantum mechanical initial
conditions turn asymptotically into standing waves which are the gauge analog
of the Sakharov oscillations. Even if the rate of dilution of the hypermagnetic

the covariant conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, the standard
evolution for wavelengths larger than the Hubble radius fully accounts for this
anomalous scaling which is anyway unable to increase the amplitude of the
magnetic power spectra after symmetry breaking. An effective amplification of
the gauge power spectra may instead occur when the post-inflationary expansion
rate is slower than radiation. We stress that the modulations of the gauge
power spectra freeze as soon as the relevant wavelengths reenter the Hubble
radius and not at the end of inflation. After the Mpc scale crosses the
comoving Hubble radius the scaling of the magnetic power spectrum follows from
the dominance of the conductivity. From these two observations the late-time
values of the magnetic power spectra are accurately computed in the case of a
nearly scale-invariant slope and contrasted with the situation where the phases

First, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning model that
solves a slippery stochastic frozen lake, an environment considerably more
difficult than the deterministic frozen lake. Secondly, different quantum
architectures are studied as options for this hybrid quantum-classical
reinforcement learning model, all of them well-motivated by the literature.
They all show very promising performances with respect to similar classical
variants. We further characterize these choices by metrics that are relevant to
benchmark the power of quantum circuits, such as the entanglement capability,
the expressibility, and the information density of the circuits. However, we
find that these typical metrics do not directly predict the performance of a

Given the long lifespan of critical structures, this problem can be cast as a
sequential decision making problem over prescribed horizons. Partially
Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a formal framework to solve
the underlying optimal planning task. However, two issues can undermine the
POMDP solutions. Firstly, the need for a model that can adequately describe the
evolution of the structural condition under deterioration or corrective actions
and, secondly, the non-trivial task of recovery of the observation process
parameters from available monitoring data. Despite these potential challenges,
the adopted POMDP models do not typically account for uncertainty on model
parameters, leading to solutions which can be unrealistically confident. In
this work, we address both key issues. We present a framework to estimate POMDP
transition and observation model parameters directly from available data, via
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
conditioned on actions. The MCMC inference estimates distributions of the
involved model parameters. We then form and solve the POMDP problem by
exploiting the inferred distributions, to derive solutions that are robust to
model uncertainty. We successfully apply our approach on maintenance planning

how this integrated system promises to increase the number of pixels that can

in making MKID instruments more feasible for both ground-based and space-based

on the number of MKIDs which can be read, channelised, and processed with this
new system. As such, novel signal processing techniques are analysed, including
Digitally Down Converted (DDC)-corrected sub-maximally decimated sampling, in
an effort to reduce logic requirements without compromising signal to noise
ratio. It is also shown how combining the ZCU111 board with a secondary FPGA

Finally, the feasibility of extending the operational frequency range of MKIDs

decision-making agents that maximize rewards received from fully observable
environments. However, many real-world problems are partially or noisily
observable by nature, where agents do not receive the true and complete state
of the environment. Such problems are formulated as partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). Some studies applied RL to POMDPs by recalling
previous decisions and observations or inferring the true state of the
environment from received observations. Nevertheless, aggregating observations
and decisions over time is impractical for environments with high-dimensional
continuous state and action spaces. Moreover, so-called inference-based RL
approaches require large number of samples to perform well since agents eschew
uncertainty in the inferred state for the decision-making. Active inference is
a framework that is naturally formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select
decisions by minimising expected free energy (EFE). This supplies
reward-maximising (exploitative) behaviour in RL, with an information-seeking
(exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of active
inference, its usage is limited to discrete state and action spaces due to the
computational difficulty of the EFE. We propose a unified principle for joint
information-seeking and reward maximization that clarifies a theoretical
connection between active inference and RL, unifies active inference and RL,
and overcomes their aforementioned limitations. Our findings are supported by
strong theoretical analysis. The proposed framework's superior exploration
property is also validated by experimental results on partial observable tasks
with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Moreover, the results
show that our model solves reward-free problems, making task reward design
optional.

momentum to tracers of the fluid, resulting in a non-zero drift velocity in the
direction of the incoming wave. This effect is the driving mechanism allowing
particles, i.e. impurities, to be transported by the flow; in a classical
(viscous) fluid this happens usually due to the presence of viscous drag
forces. Because of the eventual absence of viscosity in quantum fluids,
impurities are driven by inertial effects and pressure gradients only. We
present theoretical predictions of a Stokes drift analogous in quantum fluids
for classical impurities obtained using multi-time analytical asymptotic
expansions. We find that, at the leading order, the drift direction and
amplitude depend on the initial impurity position with respect to the wave
phase; at the second order, dominant after averaging over initial conditions,
our theoretical model recovers the classical Stokes drift but with a
coefficient that depends on the relative particle-fluid density ratio.

References updated",,,,"hep-th hep-lat hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Within the bottom-up approach to holography, we construct a class of
six-dimensional gravity models, and discuss solutions that can be interpreted,
asymptotically in the far UV, in terms of dual five-dimensional conformal field
theories deformed by a single scalar operator. We treat the scaling dimension
of such operator, related to the mass of the one scalar field in the gravity
theory, as a free parameter. One dimension in the regular geometry is
compactified on a shrinking circle, hence mimicking confinement in the
resulting dual four-dimensional theories.
  We study the mass spectrum of bosonic states. The lightest state in this
spectrum is a scalar particle. Along the regular (confining) branch of
solutions, we find the presence of a tachyonic instability in part of the
parameter space, reached by a smooth deformation of the mass spectrum, as a
function of the boundary value of the background scalar field in the gravity
theory. In a region of parameter space nearby the tachyonic one, the lightest
scalar particle can be interpreted as an approximate dilaton, sourced by the
trace of the stress-energy tensor, and its mass is parametrically suppressed.
  We also compute the free energy, along several branches of gravity solutions.
We find that both the dilatonic and tachyonic regions of parameter space,
identified along the branch of confining solutions, are hidden behind a
first-order phase transition, so that they are not realised as stable
solutions, irrespectively of the scaling dimension of the deforming
field-theory operator. The (approximate) dilaton, in particular, appears in
metastable solutions. Yet, the mass of the lightest state, computed close to
the phase transition, is (mildly) suppressed. This feature is amplified when
the (free) parameter controlling the scaling dimension of the deformation is
5/2, half the dimension of space-time in the field theory.

shown as a generic phenomenon in correlated quantum systems including
high-temperature superconductors and the AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) family with a
kagome network. Identifying the driving force has been a central challenge for
understanding nematicity. In iron-based superconductors, the problem is
complicated because the spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom are
intimately coupled. In vanadium-based kagome superconductors AV3Sb5, the
electronic nematicity exhibits an intriguing entanglement with the charge
density wave order (CDW), making understanding its origin difficult. Recently,
a new family of titanium-based kagome superconductors ATi3Bi5 has been
synthesized. In sharp contrast to its vanadium-based counterpart, the
electronic nematicity occurs in the absence of CDW. ATi3Bi5 provides a new
window to explore the mechanism of electronic nematicity and its interplay with
the orbital degree of freedom. Here, we combine polarization-dependent
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory to
directly reveal the band topology and orbital characters of the multi-orbital
RbTi3Bi5. The promising coexistence of flat bands, type-II Dirac nodal line and
nontrivial Z2 topological states is identified in RbTi3Bi5. Remarkably, our
study clearly unveils the orbital character change along the G-M and G-K
directions, implying a strong intrinsic inter-orbital coupling in the Ti-based
kagome metals, reminiscent of iron-based superconductors. Furthermore,
doping-dependent measurements directly uncover the orbital-selective features
in the kagome bands, which can be well explained by the d-p hybridization. The
suggested d-p hybridization, in collaboration with the inter-orbital coupling,
could account for the electronic nematicity in ATi3Bi5.

for coarse-grained systems of liquid water and alanine dipeptide, we
demonstrate here that scalable Bayesian UQ via stochastic gradient MCMC

that cold posteriors can reduce the required training data size and that for
reliable UQ, multiple Markov chains are needed. Additionally, we find that
SG-MCMC and the Deep Ensemble method achieve comparable results, despite
shorter training and less hyperparameter tuning of the latter. We show that

to the ice-albedo feedback, these melt ponds experience uneven heat absorption,
and exhibit complex patterns, which has motivated the development of modelling
and data analysis to understand their particular dynamics. We provide a
multiscale shape analysis using tools from computational algebraic topology,
simultaneously capturing convexity, proximity, integrity, and feature size
complementing existing single-scale quantification. Of particular interest in
modelling the ponds is a percolation threshold at which local pond structure
begins merging into macroscopic features. This percolation threshold has
previously been observed using fractal dimension techniques. The signed
Euclidean distance transform (SEDT) is a topological encoding of heterogeneous
shape in binary images, and has been previously applied to porous media for
percolation as well as other material behaviours. Here we adapt the SEDT for
Arctic melt pond data to give a rich characterization and computation of shape,
quantifying overall melt pond development in several complementary ways, and
from which classical percolation and dimension results can be extracted. This
orientation-invariant topological approach distinguishes different dynamical

classical process of scattering long-wavelength gravitational waves off an

higher orders, we extract tree-level contributions from the Teukolsky amplitude
by an analytic continuation from a physical ($a/GM<1$) to a particle-like

\textit{conservative} part of the amplitude which is insensitive both to the
choice of boundary conditions at the black hole horizon and to branch choices

approaches to address this problem, they usually require global channel state
information, which is hard to obtain in practice, and get the sub-optimal power
allocation policy with high computational complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based
power control scheme for the HetNet, where each access point makes power
control decisions independently based on local information. To promote
cooperation among agents, we develop a penalty-based Q learning (PQL) algorithm
for MADRL systems. By introducing regularization terms in the loss function,
each agent tends to choose an experienced action with high reward when
revisiting a state, and thus the policy updating speed slows down. In this way,
an agent's policy can be learned by other agents more easily, resulting in a
more efficient collaboration process. We then implement the proposed PQL in the
considered HetNet and compare it with other distributed-training-and-execution
(DTE) algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed PQL can learn the
desired power control policy from a dynamic environment where the locations of
users change episodically and outperform existing DTE MADRL algorithms.

to perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond
the existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes
where NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the quantum
effects of non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb
blockade, we reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting
quench due to the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive
nonlinear Rabi frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show
that the presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct
nonlinearity. We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured;
and 3) ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases
exponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where
excitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast
NPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the
medium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the
presence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF
depend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe
the square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems. Our
findings can help describing recent observations of strong nonlinearity in
heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides where Moir{\'e} lattices
emerge naturally [Nature \textbf{591}, 61 (2021)]. The theory also opens the
prospects for engineering strongly nonlinear responses of polaritonic lattices

reopens the possibility that PBHs might explain at the same time (at least a

energy emission mechanism is still debated. One of the possible explanations is
the standard fireball model, which can be tested with the closure relations
(CRs), or relations between the temporal and spectral indices of a GRB. To test
these, we compile an extensive sample of radio afterglow light curves (LCs)
that span from 1997 to 2020, the most comprehensive analysis of GRBs with radio
observations to date. We fit 202 LCs from 82 distinct GRBs with a broken power
law, obtaining a sample of 26 that display a clear break and a subsample of 14
GRBs that present a radio plateau. We test these samples against CRs
corresponding to a constant-density interstellar medium (ISM) or a stellar wind
medium in both fast- and slow-cooling regimes, as well as three additional
density profiles, $k = 1, 1.5, 2.5,$ following $n \propto r^{-k}$ , and
consider sets of CRs both with and without energy injection. We find that 12 of
the 26 GRBs (46%), of which 7/12 present a radio plateau, fulfill at least one
CR in the sets tested, suggesting our data is largely incompatible with the
standard fireball model. Of the fulfilled CRs, the most preferred environment
is the ISM, SC, $\nu_m < \nu < \nu_c$ without energy injection. Our results are
consistent with previous studies that test the standard fireball model via the
CRs in radio.

Informally, a strategy is uniform when the Player's behaviour does not depend

uniformity is used to define a resource modality !, that can be exploited for
the semantics of programming languages.
  In this paper we give a new account of uniformity for strategies on event

uniformity should be expressed as ""bi-invariance"" with respect to two

two clusters, KMHK361 and NGC265, which had no previous evidence of multiple
populations. This finding corroborates the conclusion that the eMSTO is a
widespread phenomenon among clusters younger than ~2 Gyr. ii) The homogeneous
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of 19 LMC clusters reveal that the distribution
of stars along the eMSTO depends on cluster age. iii) We discovered a new
feature along the eMSTO of NGC1783, which consists of a distinct group of stars
going on the red side of the eMSTO in CMDs composed of ultraviolet filters.
Furthermore, we derived the proper motions of stars in the fields of view of
clusters with multi-epoch images. Proper motions allowed us to separate the
bulk of bright field stars from cluster members and investigate the internal
kinematics of stellar populations in various LMC and SMC fields. As an example,
we analyze the field around NGC346 to disentangle the motions of its stellar
populations, including NGC364 and BS90, young and pre-MS stars in the
star-forming region associated with NGC346, and young and old field stellar
populations of the SMC. Based on these results and the fields around five
additional clusters, we find that young SMC stars exhibit elongated
proper-motion distributions that point toward the LMC, thus bringing new
evidence for a kinematic connection between the LMC and SMC.

called ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service), caused by a super-linear

prevalence of ReDoS, past work proposed automatic tools to detect and fix
regexes. Although these tools were evaluated in automatic experiments, their
usability has not yet been studied; usability has not been a focus of prior
work. Our insight is that the usability of existing tools to detect and fix
regexes will improve if we complement them with anti-patterns and fix
strategies of vulnerable regexes. We developed novel anti-patterns for
vulnerable regexes, and a collection of fix strategies to fix them. We derived
our anti-patterns and fix strategies from a novel theory of regex infinite
ambiguity - a necessary condition for regexes vulnerable to ReDoS. We proved
the soundness and completeness of our theory. We evaluated the effectiveness of
our anti-patterns, both in an automatic experiment and when applied manually.
Then, we evaluated how much our anti-patterns and fix strategies improve
developers' understanding of the outcome of detection and fixing tools. Our
evaluation found that our anti-patterns were effective over a large dataset of
regexes (N=209,188): 100% precision and 99% recall, improving the state of the
art 50% precision and 87% recall. Our anti-patterns were also more effective

The comparison yields good agreement when analyzing their reconnection rates

large adaptive PIC regions are needed within the MHD domain, which indicates
that the magnetic island coalescence problem is highly kinetic in nature where
the coupling between the macro-scale MHD and micro-scale kinetic physics is
important.

linear elastic medium. To this end, we employ a phase-field model to
approximate the crack dynamics. Phase-field methods belong to
interface-capturing approaches in which the interface is only given by a
smeared zone. For multi-domain problems, the accuracy of the coupling
conditions is, however, of utmost importance. Here, interface-tracking methods
are preferred, since the interface is resolved on mesh edges up to
discretization errors, but it does not depend on the length scale parameter of
some smeared zone. The key objective of this work is to construct a robust
framework that computes first a crack path via the phase-field method
(interface-capturing) and then does an interface-tracking reconstruction. We
then discuss several approaches to reconstruct the Eulerian description of the
open crack domain. This includes unfitted approaches where a level-set of the
crack interface is constructed and an approach where the geometry is re-meshed.
Using this reconstructed domain, we can compute the fluid-structure interaction
problem between the fluid in the crack and the interacting solid. With the
explicit mesh reconstruction of the two domains, we can then use an
interface-tracking Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) discretisation approach
for the resulting fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem. Our algorithmic
procedure is realised in one final numerical algorithm and one implementation.
We substantiate our approach using several numerical examples based on
Sneddon's benchmark and corresponding extensions to Stokes fluid-filled
regimes.

two-point correlation functions focusing, for pedagogical reasons, on two
examples namely C(0,5) and C(2,5) at $\nu = -k$. We then display, in a
learn-by-example approach, some of the puzzling properties and structures of
these lambda-extensions: for an infinite set of (algebraic) values of $
\lambda$ these power series become algebraic functions, and for a finite set of
(rational) values of lambda they become D-finite functions, more precisely
polynomials (of different degrees) in the complete elliptic integrals of the
first and second kind K and E. For generic values of $ \lambda$ these power
series are not D-finite, they are differentially algebraic. For an infinite
number of other (rational) values of $ \lambda$ these power series are globally
bounded series, thus providing an example of an infinite number of globally
bounded differentially algebraic series. Finally, taking the example of a
product of two diagonal two-point correlation functions, we suggest that many
more families of non-linear ODEs of the Painlev\'e type remain to be discovered
on the two-dimensional Ising model, as well as their structures, and in
particular their associated lambda extensions. The question of their possible

introduces a fictitious electronic temperature that smooths the discontinuities
of the integrands; consequently, a corresponding fictitious entropic term
arises, and needs to be considered in the total free energy functional.
Advanced smearing techniques -- such as Methfessel-Paxton and cold smearing --
have been introduced to guarantee that the system's total free energy remains
independent of the smearing temperature at least up to the second order. In
doing so, they give rise to non-monotonic occupation functions (and, for
Methfessel-Paxton, non-positive definite), which can result in the chemical
potential not being uniquely defined. We explore this shortcoming in detail and
introduce a numerical protocol utilizing Newton's minimization method that is
able to identify the desired Fermi energy. We validate the method by
calculating the Fermi energy of $\sim$20,000 materials and comparing it with
the results of standard bisection approaches. In passing, we also highlight how
traditional approaches, based on Fermi-Dirac or Gaussian smearing, are actually

evaluation of $\ell_p$-bounded adversarial defenses. Projected Gradient Descent

experimentally verify this assertion on a synthetic-data example and by
evaluating our proposed method across 25 different $\ell_{\infty}$-robust

to the single loss counterparts. In the CIFAR-10 dataset, our strongest

with a combination of mimetic f(G) gravity and swampland dS conjectures. We
analyze and evaluate these results. Therefore, we first thoroughly introduce
the mimetic f(G) gravity and calculate some cosmological parameters such as the
scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the slow-roll
parameters. Also, we investigate the potential according to the mimetic f(G)

condition. By expressing the coefficient of swampland dS conjectures viz
$C_{1}$ and $C_2$ in terms of $n_{s}$ and $r$, we plot some figures and
determine the allowable range for each of these cosmological parameters and
these coefficients, and finally, compare these results with observable data
such as Planck and BICEP2/Keck array data. We show $C_{1}$ and $C_2$ are not

this inflationary model. Then we examine it with further refining swampland dS
conjecture, which has a series of free parameters such as $a,b>0$, $q>2$, and
$a+b=1$. By adjusting these parameters, the compatibility of the mentioned
conjecture with the inflationary model can be discussed. We determine the

variety of problems, including probing the interior of Minkowski spacetime and
modelling boundary observables in de Sitter spacetime. Here we study the
analytic structure of wavefunction coefficients in Minkowski as a function of
their kinematics. We introduce an off-shell wavefunction in terms of amputated
time-ordered correlation functions and show that it is analytic in the complex
energy plane except for possible singularities on the negative real axis. These
singularities are determined to all loop orders by a simple energy-conservation
condition. We confirm this picture by developing a Landau analysis of
wavefunction loop integrals and corroborate our findings with several explicit
calculations in scalar field theories. This analytic structure allows us to
derive new UV/IR sum rules for the wavefunction that fix the coefficients in
its low-energy expansion in terms of integrals of discontinuities in the
corresponding UV-completion. In contrast to the analogous sum rules for
scattering amplitudes, the wavefunction sum rules can also constrain
total-derivative interactions. We explicitly verify these new relations at
one-loop order in simple UV models of a light and a heavy scalar. Our results,
which apply to both Lorentz invariant and boost-breaking theories, pave the way
towards deriving wavefunction positivity bounds in flat and cosmological
spacetimes.

An
electric-field controllable spin state of magnetic molecules is of fundamental
importance for applications while its realization remains challenging. To date
the observed spin-electric interaction based on spin-orbit coupling or spin
dipole coupling is useful to tune fine spin structures but too weak to flip the
spin state. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to realize enhanced
spin-electric coupling and flip the spin states by tuning the spin
superexchange between local spins. Using first-principles calculations and
Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate this effect in a family of magnetic
molecules, transition metallic Porphyrins. We show that their d-{\pi} and
{\pi}-{\pi} spin superexchange couplings are determined by the relative
energies of d and {\pi} electronic states, which are sensitive to the applied
electric field. Therefore, applying electric field can tune a wide range of
magnetic ground states, including ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and
antiferromagnetic configurations. This spin-electric coupling may provide a new
approach for designing and controlling molecular spintronics.

protoplanetary disc (PPD) can accrete gas efficiently through the gap and
doubles its mass in $\sim 0.1$ Myr. The planet also migrates inwards on a
timescale of $\sim 0.1$ Myr. These timescales are short compared to PPD
lifetimes, and raise questions about the origins of cold giant exoplanets.
However, PPDs are unlikely to be globally turbulent, and instead they may
launch magnetised winds such that accretion towards the star occurs in laminar
accretion flows located in narrow layers near the surfaces of the disc. The aim
of this study is to examine the rate at which gas accretes onto Jovian mass
planets that are embedded in layered PPDs. We use 3D hydrodynamical simulations
of planets embedded in PPDs, in which a constant radial mass flux towards the
star of ${\dot m} = 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is sustained. We consider a
classical viscous alpha model, and also models in which an external torque is
applied in narrow surface layers to mimic the effects of a magnetised wind. The
accreting layers are parameterised by their column densities $\Sigma_{\rm A}$,
and we consider values in the range 0.1 to 10 g cm$^{-2}$. The viscous model
gives results in agreement with previous studies. We find the accretion rate
onto the planet in the layered models crucially depends on the planet's ability
to block the wind-induced mass flow. For $\Sigma_{\rm A}=10$ g cm$^{-2}$, the
planet torque can block the mass flow through the disc, accretion onto the
planet is slow, and a mass doubling time of 10 Myr is obtained. For
$\Sigma_{\rm A}=0.1$ g cm$^{-2}$, accretion is fast and the mass doubling time
is 0.2 Myr. Although the radial mass flow through the layered disc models is
always $10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, adopting different values of
$\Sigma_{\rm A}$ leads to very different gas accretion rates onto gas giant
planets.

consistent with disc reprocessing but not with reprocessing in the Broad Line

wavelengths, indicating an outer edge (Rout) to the reprocessor. We have
compared truncated disc reprocessing models to the combined HiPERCAM and
previous X-ray/UV lags. For the normally accepted mass of 3.6E5 solar, we
obtain reasonable agreement with zero spin, Rout ~1700 Rg, and the DONE
physically-motivated temperature-dependent disc colour correction factor
(fcol). A smaller mass of 4E4 solar can only be accomodated if fcol=2.4, which
is probably unrealistically high. Disc self gravity is probably unimportant in
this low mass AGN but an obscuring wind may provide an edge. For the small mass
the dust sublimation radius is similar to Rout, so the wind could be dusty.
However for the more likely large mass the sublimation radius is further out so
the optically-thick base of a line-driven gaseous wind is more likely. The
inner edge of the BLR is close to Rout in both cases. These observations
provide the first good evidence for a truncated AGN disc and caution that
truncation should be included in reverberation lag modelling.

transitions and characterize them based on spectral and localization
properties. Contrary to uncorrelated disorder, gap closing and reopening
topological transitions can be induced by quasiperiodicity. These can separate
widely different phases, including (i) trivial and Chern insulators, both with
ballistic states near the gap edges; (ii) Chern insulators with critical states
around the gap edges or (iii) Chern and trivial insulators respectively with
ballistic and localized gap-edge states. Transition (i) is similar to
clean-limit topological transitions due to the ballistic character of the
gap-edge states, but at the same time resembles (quasi)disorder driven
topological Anderson insulator phenomena. On the other hand, transitions (ii)
and (iii) have no clean-limit counterpart. Additionally, quasiperiodicity can
also induce topological transitions into a trivial state for which the gap
closes and does not reopen, a scenario that resembles more what is observed
with uncorrelated disorder. However, we found that such transitions can also be
non-conventional in that they can be accompanied by the emergence of
intermediate metallic and critical phases where the Chern number is not
quantized. Our results show that a rich variety of topological phase
transitions, not previously realized experimentally nor predicted theoretically
can be attained when applying quasiperiodic modulations to simple Chern
insulators. Such models have previously been realized experimentally in widely
different platforms, including in optical lattices and photonic or acoustic
media, where quasiperiodicity effects can be incorporated. The unveiled
topological phase transitions can in principle be observed experimentally with

measure the cyclotron radiation of the resulting $\beta$-decay electrons. To
validate the feasibility of this method, Project 8 has designed a test stand to
benchmark the performance of an antenna array at reconstructing signals that
mimic those of genuine CRES events. To generate synthetic CRES events, a novel

science in topics as diverse as experimental design, state classification, and
even studies on quantum foundations. Here, we experimentally realize an
approach for defining custom prior distributions that are automatically tuned
using ML for use with Bayesian quantum state estimation methods. Previously,
researchers have looked to Bayesian quantum state tomography due to its unique
advantages like natural uncertainty quantification, the return of reliable
estimates under any measurement condition, and minimal mean-squared error.
However, practical challenges related to long computation times and conceptual
issues concerning how to incorporate prior knowledge most suitably can
overshadow these benefits. Using both simulated and experimental measurement
results, we demonstrate that ML-defined prior distributions reduce net
convergence times and provide a natural way to incorporate both implicit and
explicit information directly into the prior distribution. These results
constitute a promising path toward practical implementations of Bayesian
quantum state tomography.

follows the streamer breakdown phase. The modelling results show that the
distinct striated structures feature local spatial maxima and minima in charged
and excited particle densities, which are more pronounced during the positive
polarity. Their formation is explained by a repetitive stepwise ionisation of
metastable argon atoms and ionisation of excimers, causing a disturbance of the

size, which can lead to biased training or overfitting. One potential solution
is to synthetically generate realistic MRIs via generative models such as
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, existing GANs for synthesizing
realistic brain MRIs largely rely on image-to-image conditioned transformations
requiring extensive, well-curated pairs of MRI samples for training. On the
other hand, unconditioned GAN models (i.e., those generating MRI from random
noise) are unstable during training and tend to produce blurred images during
inference. Here, we propose an efficient strategy that generates high fidelity
3D brain MRI via Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM). To this end, we train a
conditional DPM with attention to generate an MRI sub-volume (a set of slices
at arbitrary locations) conditioned on another subset of slices from the same
MRI. By computing attention weights from slice indices and using a mask to
encode the target and conditional slices, the model is able to learn the
long-range dependency across distant slices with limited computational
resources. After training, the model can progressively synthesize a new 3D
brain MRI by generating the first subset of slices from random noise and
conditionally generating subsequent slices. Based on 1262 t1-weighted MRIs from
three neuroimaging studies, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can generate high quality 3D MRIs that share the same distribution as
real MRIs and are more realistic than the ones produced by GAN-based models.

the red-giant luminosity function of stellar clusters. It is caused by the
passage of the hydrogen-burning shell through the composition discontinuity
left at the point of the deepest penetration by the convective envelope. When
crossing the discontinuity the usual trend in increasing luminosity reverses
for a short time before it increases again, causing a zig-zag in the
evolutionary track. In spite of its apparent simplicity the actual physical
reason behind the decrease in luminosity is not well understood and several
different explanations have been offered. Here we use a recently proposed
simple toy-model for the structure of low-mass red giants, together with
previous results, to show beyond reasonable doubt that the change in luminosity
at the RGBB can be traced to the change in the mean molecular weight of the
layers on top of the burning shell. And that these changes happen on a nuclear
timescale. The change in the effective mean molecular weight, as the burning
shell approaches the discontinuity, causes a drop in the temperature of the
burning shell which is attenuated by the consequent feedback contraction of the
layers immediately below the burning shell. Our work shows that, when applied
correctly, including the feedback on the structure of the core together with of
the increase in the mass of the core, shell-source homology relations do a
great quantitative job in explaining the properties of full evolutionary models
at the RGBB.

the use of a pure pixel-based model to perform image, text, and multimodal

regular images and text rendered as images. CLIPPO performs image-based tasks

language understanding tasks, without any word-level loss (language modelling
or masked language modelling), outperforming pixel-based prior work.
Surprisingly, CLIPPO can obtain good accuracy in visual question answering,
simply by rendering the question and image together. Finally, we exploit the
fact that CLIPPO does not require a tokenizer to show that it can achieve
strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without modifications.

the first time in a protoplanetary disk. We characterize the chemical and
physical conditions in the inner few au of the GW Lup disk using these

column densities and temperatures. The $Q$-branches of these molecules,
including those of hot-bands, are particularly sensitive to temperature and
column density. We find that the $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ emission in the GW Lup disk is
coming from optically thick emission at a temperature of $\sim$400 K.
$^{13}$CO$_{2}$ is optically thinner and based on a lower temperature of

radius than $^{12}$CO$_{2}$. The derived $N_{\rm{CO_{2}}}$/$N_{\rm{H_{2}O}}$

Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations

shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and
appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by
introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with
the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and
the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization
method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise
easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization.
Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method
is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and

investigate the gravitational collapse of a cloud core ($\sim 10^{3}\ \rm

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations considering ambipolar diffusion (AD),
the dominant non-ideal effects in the primordial-gas. We systematically study
rotating cloud cores either with or without turbulence and permeated with
uniform fields of different strengths. We find that AD can slightly suppress
the field growth by dynamo especially on scales smaller than the Jeans-scale at
the density range $10^{10}-10^{14}\ \rm cm^{-3}$, while we could not see the AD
effect on the temperature evolution, since the AD heating rate is always
smaller than compression heating. The inefficiency of AD makes the field as
strong as $10^{3}-10^{5} \rm\ G$ near the formed protostar, much stronger than
in the present-day cases, even in cases with initially weak fields. The
magnetic field affects the inflow motion when amplified to the equipartition
level with turbulence on the Jeans-scale, although disturbed fields do not

sources including 15 previously known supersoft AGN or TDEs, so demonstrating
the efficiency of our selection. Of the remaining sample, 36 sources, although
showing steeper-than-usual spectra, are optically classified as AGN. The
remaining nine, previously unknown sources show spectral properties consistent
with the emission by extremely soft-excess dominated AGN (five sources) or TDE
(four sources). An {\it XMM-Newton} follow-up observation of one of these
sources confirmed its likely TDE nature. Our work is the first attempt to
discover TDEs by their spectral features rather than their variability and has
been successful in retrieving known TDEs as well as discovering new extreme
ultrasoft sources, including four new TDE candidates, one of which is confirmed
via follow-up observations.

the model and compare its predictions with data from 7 star-forming

As an example, we determine how the crystallographic orientation of the

other superconducting states. However, the spin-pumping effect does not show a

smaller than the normal state value for all $T$. For orientations not hosting

(so-called long GRBs), the intrinsic prompt gamma-ray emission appears, on
average, to last longer for bursts at lower redshifts. We explore the nature of
this duration-redshift anti-correlation, describing systems and conditions in
which this cosmological evolution could arise. In particular, we explore its
dependence on metallicity of a massive star progenitor, as we can securely
count on the average stellar metallicity to increase with decreasing redshift.
Although higher metallicity/lower redshift stars lose mass and angular momentum
through line-driven winds, in some cases these stars are able to form more
extended accretion disks when they collapse, potentially leading to longer
duration GRBs. We also examine how this duration-redshift trend may show up in
interacting binary models composed of a massive star and compact object
companion, recently suggested to be the progenitors of radio bright GRBs. Under
certain conditions, mass loss and equation of state effects from higher
metallicity, lower redshift massive stars can decrease the binary separation.
This can then lead to spin-up of the massive star and allow for a longer
duration GRB upon the massive star's collapse. Finally, the duration-redshift
trend may also be supported by a relatively larger population of
small-separation binaries born in situ at low redshift.

the epoch of matter-radiation equality in order to resolve the Hubble tension,
introduces a new coincidence problem: why should the EDE dynamics occur near
equality if EDE is decoupled from both matter and radiation? The resolution of
this problem may lie in an {\it early dark sector} (EDS), wherein the dark
matter mass is dependent on the EDE scalar field. Concretely, we consider a
Planck-suppressed coupling of EDE to dark matter, as would naturally arise from
breaking of the global $U(1)$ shift symmetry of the former by quantum gravity
effects. With a sufficiently flat potential, the rise to dominance of dark
matter at matter-radiation equality itself triggers the rolling and subsequent
decay of the EDE. We show that this {\it trigger} EDS (tEDS) model can
naturally resolve the EDE coincidence problem at the background level without
any fine tuning of the coupling to dark matter or of the initial conditions.
When fitting to current cosmological data, including that from the local
distance ladder and the low-redshift amplitude of fluctuations, the tEDS
maximum-likelihood model performs comparably to EDE for resolving the Hubble
tension, achieving $H_0 =71.2$ km/s/Mpc. However, fitting the \emph{Planck}
cosmic microwave background data requires a specific range of initial field
positions to balance the scalar field fluctuations that drive acoustic
oscillations, providing testable differences with other EDE models.

Employing the non-perturbative functional renormalization-group, we find that
the model hosts a regime where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. This new
phase is characterized by a relevant imaginary mass, corresponding to
monstronic excitations displaying exponentially growing amplitudes for
time-like intervals and tachyonic (Lieb-Robison-bound breaking, oscillatory)
excitations for space-like intervals. Furthermore, since the phase manifests
itself as an unconventional attractive spinodal fixed point, which is typically
unreachable in finite real-life systems, we find that the effective
renormalized mass reached can be tuned through the microscopic parameters of
the model. Our results further predict that the new phase is robust to external
gauge fields, contrary to the celebrated BKT phase in the PT unbroken sector.
The gauge field then provides an effective and easy means to tune the
renormalized imaginary mass through a wide range of values, and therefore the
amplitude growth/oscillation rate of the corresponding excitations.

implied H$_2$O production rates for each object. We attempt to reconcile
outgassing induced acceleration with the lack of visible comae or photometric
activity via the absence of surface dust and low levels of gas production.
Although these objects are small and some are rapidly rotating, surface
cohesive forces are stronger than the rotational forces and rapid rotation
alone cannot explain the lack of surface debris. It is possible that surface
dust was removed previously, perhaps via outgassing activity that increased the
rotation rates to their present day value. We calculate dust production rates
of order $\sim10^{-4}$ g s$^{-1}$ in each object assuming that the nuclei are

maker is interested in maximizing the expected discounted value of a stream of
rewards received at future stages at various states which are visited according
to a controlled Markov chain. Many algorithms including linear programming
methods are available in the literature to compute an optimal policy when the
rewards and transition probabilities are deterministic. In this paper, we
consider an MDP problem where the transition probabilities are known and the
reward vector is a random vector whose distribution is partially known. We
formulate the MDP problem using distributionally robust chance-constrained
optimization framework under various types of moments based uncertainty sets,
and statistical-distance based uncertainty sets defined using phi-divergence
and Wasserstein distance metric. For each type of uncertainty set, we consider
the case where a random reward vector has either a full support or a
nonnegative support. For the case of full support, we show that the
distributionally robust chance-constrained Markov decision process is
equivalent to a second-order cone programming problem for the moments and
phi-divergence distance based uncertainty sets, and it is equivalent to a
mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem for an Wasserstein distance
based uncertainty set. For the case of nonnegative support, it is equivalent to
a copositive optimization problem and a biconvex optimization problem for the
moments based uncertainty sets and Wasserstein distance based uncertainty set,

illustrate numerical experiments on randomly generated instances.

Frechet distance loss to force the underlying training data distribution into a

LSM distribution is processed to detect its deviation from the forced
distribution; hence, the AI system could predict its generalizability status
for any previously unseen data set. If low model generalizability is detected,
then the user is informed by a warning message. While the approach is
applicable for most classification deep neural networks, we demonstrate its
application to a brain metastases (BM) detector for T1-weighted

T1c studies acquired internally, and tested using (1) 42 internally and (2) 72

acceleration on the sub-kilometer near-Earth asteroid (523599) 2003 RM. Due to
its orbit, 2003 RM experiences favorable observing apparitions every 5 years.
Thus, since its discovery, 2003 RM has been extensively tracked with
ground-based optical facilities in 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018. We find that the
observed plane-of-sky positions cannot be explained with a purely
gravity-driven trajectory. Including a transverse nongravitational acceleration
allows us to match all observational data, but its magnitude is inconsistent
with perturbations typical of asteroids such as the Yarkovsky effect or solar
radiation pressure. After ruling out that the orbital deviations are due to a
close approach or collision with another asteroid, we hypothesize that this
anomalous acceleration is caused by unseen cometary outgassing. A detailed
search for evidence of cometary activity with archival and deep observations
from Pan-STARRS and the VLT does not reveal any detectable dust production.
However, the best-fitting H$_2$O sublimation model allows for brightening due
to activity consistent with the scatter of the data. We estimate the production
rate required for H$_2$O outgassing to power the acceleration, and find that,
assuming a diameter of 300 m, 2003 RM would require Q(H$_2$O)$\sim10^{23}$
molec s$^{-1}$ at perihelion. We investigate the recent dynamical history of
2003 RM and find that the object most likely originated in the mid-to-outer
main belt ($\sim86\%$) as opposed to from the Jupiter-family comet region

matrix $\lambda$, however we allow for a relative scaling of the coupling
strength. The SM is further extended by two fermion representations,
transforming as an $SU(2)_L$ doublet and singlet, respectively, and mediating
these interactions. The fermions additionally couple to the SM Higgs doublet
via a new Yukawa coupling. To study the model's phenomenology we first
investigate constraints from collider searches, flavour experiments, precision
tests of the SM, the DM relic density, and direct as well as indirect detection
experiments individually. We then perform a combined analysis by demanding that
all mentioned constraints are satisfied simultaneously. We use the results of
this combined analysis and examine if the model is capable of accommodating the
$(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly within its viable parameter space without introducing
fine-tuned lepton masses. For all benchmark scenarios we consider, we find that
the central value of $\Delta a_\mu^\text{exp}$ can be reached without
generating too large corrections to the lepton masses. We hence conclude that
this model qualifies as a viable and attractive lepton-flavoured DM model that

simple, connected graphs N=(V,E) with leaf set X, for X some set of species, in
which every internal vertex in N has degree three. One approach used to
construct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection P of
phylogenetic trees and to look for a network N that contains each tree in P and
that minimizes the quantity r(N) = |E|-(|V|-1) over all such networks. Such a
network always exists, and the quantity r(N) for an optimal network N is called
the hybrid number of P. In this paper, we give a new characterization for the

in terms of a cherry picking sequence for the two trees, although to prove that
our characterization holds we need to define the sequence more generally for
two forests. Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for
collections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first
variant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the
hybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and
reconnect distance between the two trees, our new characterization also

providers. While this technique has worked well for easily divisible resources
like CPU and local DRAM, it has struggled to incorporate more expensive and
monolithic resources like GPUs or other application accelerators. We cannot
simply slap a GPU on a FaaS platform and expect to keep all the benefits
serverless promises. We need a more tailored approach if we want to best
utilize these critical resources.
  In this paper we present Kernel-as-a-Service (KaaS), a serverless interface
to GPUs. In KaaS, GPUs are first-class citizens that are invoked just like any
other serverless function. Rather than mixing host and GPU code as is typically
done, KaaS runs graphs of GPU-only code while host code is run on traditional
functions. The KaaS system is responsible for managing GPU memory and schedules
user kernels across the entire pool of available GPUs rather than relying on
static allocations. This approach allows us to more effectively share expensive
GPU resources, especially in multitenant environments like the cloud. We add
support for KaaS to the Ray distributed computing framework and evaluate it
with workloads including a TVM-based deep learning compiler and a BLAS library.
Our results show that KaaS is able to drive up to 50x higher throughput and 16x
lower latency when GPU resources are contended.

loadability of inverter-based resources and synchronous machines, while
analyzing the effects of load and network dynamic models on small-signal

scenario-based testing method that evaluates the safety of the Waymo Driver
Automated Driving Systems' (ADS) intended functionality in conflict situations
initiated by other road users that require urgent evasive maneuvers. Because
SAE Level 4 ADS are responsible for the dynamic driving task (DDT), when
engaged, without immediate human intervention, evaluating a Level 4 ADS using
scenario-based testing is difficult due to the potentially infinite number of
operational scenarios in which hazardous situations may unfold. To that end, in
this paper we first describe the safety test objectives for the CAT
methodology, including the collision and serious injury metrics and the
reference behavior model representing a non-impaired eyes on conflict human
driver used to form an acceptance criterion. Afterward, we introduce the
process for identifying potentially hazardous situations from a combination of
human data, ADS testing data, and expert knowledge about the product design and
associated Operational Design Domain (ODD). The test allocation and execution
strategy is presented next, which exclusively utilize simulations constructed
from sensor data collected on a test track, real-world driving, or from
simulated sensor data. The paper concludes with the presentation of results
from applying CAT to the fully autonomous ride-hailing service that Waymo
operates in San Francisco, California and Phoenix, Arizona. The iterative
nature of scenario identification, combined with over ten years of experience
of on-road testing, results in a scenario database that converges to a
representative set of responder role scenarios for a given ODD. Using Waymo's

with disabilities on crowd dynamics and the optimal exits. Does the placement
of seating for people with disabilities affect the time it takes for the last
person to exit the building? What effect does poor signage have on the time it
takes for able-bodied and people with disabilities to exit safely? What happens
if some people do not know about alternative exits in their panicked state?
Using our agent-based model, we will investigate these questions while also
adjusting other outside effects such as the density of the crowd, the speed at

shock particle acceleration and energy losses is consistent with the scenario
of a pulsation-driven shock wave traveling into the stellar corona and
accelerating electrons to $\sim$ GeV energies and with Inverse Compton (IC)
emission from the UV stellar background leading to the observed X-ray
enhancement. The index of the non-thermal IC photon spectrum, assumed to be a
simple power-law in the $[1-8]$ keV energy range, radially integrated within
the shell $[3 - 10]$ stellar radii, is consistent with an enhanced X-ray
spectrum powered by shock-accelerated electrons. An unlikely $\sim$100-fold
amplification { via turbulent dynamo} of the magnetic field at the shock
propagating through density inhomogeneities in the stellar corona is required
for the synchrotron emission to dominate over the IC; the lack of
time-correlation between radio synchrotron and stellar pulsation contributes to
make synchrotron as an unlikely emission mechanism for the flux enhancement.
Although current observations cannot rule out a high-flux two-temperature

work, we seek to understand the relationships between attention models in
different time and frequency domains. Theoretically, we show that attention
models in different domains are equivalent under linear conditions (i.e.,
linear kernel to attention scores). Empirically, we analyze how attention
models of different domains show different behaviors through various synthetic
experiments with seasonality, trend and noise, with emphasis on the role of
softmax operation therein. Both these theoretical and empirical analyses
motivate us to propose a new method: TDformer (Trend Decomposition
Transformer), that first applies seasonal-trend decomposition, and then
additively combines an MLP which predicts the trend component with Fourier
attention which predicts the seasonal component to obtain the final prediction.
Extensive experiments on benchmark time-series forecasting datasets demonstrate
that TDformer achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing
attention-based models.

  One uses recent advances in positive curvatures to obtain a simple and
geometric classification of fat homogeneous Riemannian foliations. Although
B\'erard-Bergery established a similar classification in \cite{bergeryfat}, we
believe one of the novelties of this paper lies in the combination of dual
foliations and Ambrose--Singer's Theorem with metric deformations: motivated by
the regularization properties of Cheeger deformations and the non-metric
dependence of fatness, we show that: the vertical bundle of a fat submersion is
obstructed, being wholly generated by the O'Neill tensor (this is a consequence
of a dual-leaf argument); we prove that any fat foliation induced by the fibers
of a fiber bundle with compact structure group is \emph{twisted} (any
Riemannian submersion compatible metric has dual-foliation with only one dual
leaf). We also prove that if the total space of a fat Riemannian submersion has
non-negative sectional curvature, then their leaves are a symmetric space. We
conclude further classification results.

achieves similar accuracy on a VL task to a multimodal one, indicates that
so-called unimodal collapse occurred. However, accuracy-based tests fail to
detect e.g., when the model prediction is wrong, while the model used relevant
information from a modality. Instead, we propose MM-SHAP, a
performance-agnostic multimodality score based on Shapley values that reliably
quantifies in which proportions a multimodal model uses individual modalities.
We apply MM-SHAP in two ways: (1) to compare models for their average degree of
multimodality, and (2) to measure for individual models the contribution of
individual modalities for different tasks and datasets. Experiments with six VL
models -- LXMERT, CLIP and four ALBEF variants -- on four VL tasks highlight
that unimodal collapse can occur to different degrees and in different

one-sided. Based on our results, we recommend MM-SHAP for analysing multimodal

hopping) and time diversity (e.g., carrier sense multiple access) are
conventionally leveraged to schedule communication channels. However,
multi-radio scheduling over a limited set of channels to minimize the effect of

a peak electron density $n_e$ ranging between 0.35 $n_c$ and 0.7 $n_c$. In this
density interval, the survival of a percentage of the laser pulse until the gas
density peak, while being strongly absorbed ($>$90$\%$) and creating a hot
electron population in the gas up-ramp, is singled out as a necessary condition
for shock formation. Moreover, the laser absorption must give rise to a super

relevant source domain to a target domain. However, most existing transfer
learning theories and algorithms focus on IID tasks, where the source/target

effort is devoted to theoretically studying the knowledge transferability on
non-IID tasks, e.g., cross-network mining. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we
propose rigorous generalization bounds and algorithms for cross-network

characterize the cross-network knowledge transferability from the perspective

novel Graph Subtree Discrepancy to measure the graph distribution shift between
source and target graphs. Then the generalization error bounds on cross-network

fails to be space filling is known as ''intermittency'' and it has strong
experimental foundations. Consequently, real turbulent flows do not satisfy the
central assumptions of homogeneity and self-similarity in the K41 theory, and
the K41 prediction of structure function exponents $\zeta_p=\frac{p}{3}$ might
be inaccurate. In this work we prove that, in the inviscid case, energy
dissipation that is lower-dimensional in an appropriate sense implies
deviations from the K41 prediction in every $p-$th order structure function for
$p>3$. By exploiting a Lagrangian-type Minkowski dimension that is very
reminiscent of the Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis, our strongest upper
bound on $\zeta_p$ coincides with the $\beta-$model proposed by Frisch, Sulem
and Nelkin in the late 70s, adding some rigorous analytical foundations to the
model. More generally we explore the relationship between dimensionality
assumptions on the dissipation support and restrictions on the $p-$th order
absolute structure functions, making quantitative an objection to K41
originally attributed to Landau. This approach differs from the current
mathematical works on intermittency by its focus on geometrical rather than
purely analytical assumptions. The proof is based on a new local variant of the
celebrated Constantin-E-Titi argument that features the use of a third order
commutator estimate, the special double regularity of the pressure, and
mollification along the flow of a vector field.

of higher-order computation with ""reader/writer"" effects: higher-order mutable
store, input/output, and probabilistic and non-deterministic computation.
  The FMC derives from the lambda-calculus by taking the standard operational
perspective of a call-by-name stack machine as primary, and introducing two
natural generalizations. One, ""locations"", introduces multiple stacks, which
each may represent an effect and so enable effect operators to be encoded into
the abstraction and application constructs of the calculus. The second,
""sequencing"", is known from kappa-calculus and concatenative programming
languages, and introduces the imperative notions of ""skip"" and ""sequence"". This
enables the encoding of reduction strategies, including call-by-value
lambda-calculus and monadic constructs.
  The encoding of effects into generalized abstraction and application means
that standard results from the lambda-calculus may carry over to effects. The
main result is confluence, which is possible because encoded effects reduce
algebraically rather than operationally. Reduction generates the familiar
algebraic laws for state, and unlike in the monadic setting, reader/writer
effects combine seamlessly. A system of simple types confers termination of the
machine.

deep learning by adapting knowledge from a source to a target domain. For
privacy and efficiency concerns, source-free domain adaptation extends
unsupervised domain adaptation by adapting a pre-trained source model to an
unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. However, most
existing source-free domain adaptation methods to date focus on the
transductive setting, where the target training set is also the testing set. In
this paper, we address source-free domain adaptation in the more realistic
inductive setting, where the target training and testing sets are mutually
exclusive. We propose a new semi-supervised fine-tuning method named Dual
Moving Average Pseudo-Labeling (DMAPL) for source-free inductive domain
adaptation. We first split the unlabeled training set in the target domain into
a pseudo-labeled confident subset and an unlabeled less-confident subset
according to the prediction confidence scores from the pre-trained source
model. Then we propose a soft-label moving-average updating strategy for the
unlabeled subset based on a moving-average prototypical classifier, which
gradually adapts the source model towards the target domain. Experiments show
that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms
previous methods by large margins.

data-driven optimization problem are essential to decision-making systems,
especially under limitations on time and computational resources. In this
study, we introduce a general-purpose hierarchical learning architecture that
is based on the progressive partitioning of a possibly multi-resolution data
space. The optimal partition is gradually approximated by solving a sequence of
optimization sub-problems that yield a sequence of partitions with increasing
number of subsets. We show that the solution of each optimization problem can
be estimated online using gradient-free stochastic approximation updates. As a
consequence, a function approximation problem can be defined within each subset
of the partition and solved using the theory of two-timescale stochastic
approximation algorithms. This simulates an annealing process and defines a
robust and interpretable heuristic method to gradually increase the complexity
of the learning architecture in a task-agnostic manner, giving emphasis to
regions of the data space that are considered more important according to a
predefined criterion. Finally, by imposing a tree structure in the progression
of the partitions, we provide a means to incorporate potential multi-resolution
structure of the data space into this approach, significantly reducing its
complexity, while introducing hierarchical variable-rate feature extraction
properties similar to certain classes of deep learning architectures.

their reflectivities can have fluctuations obeying a Rayleigh-distribution. In

In particular, the conversion module allows exact and efficient performance

coincident with the dynamical center of this dwarf galaxy. We investigate the
spectral energy distribution and spatial extension of this source, with the
goal of testing two hypotheses: (1) the emission is due to millisecond pulsars

magnetospheric emission, and find no evidence for a higher-energy component.
For the dark matter interpretation, we find that this signal favors a dark
matter mass of $m_{\chi} = 29.6 \pm 5.8$ GeV and an annihilation cross section
of $\sigma v = (2.1 \pm 0.59) \times 10^{-26} \,\text{cm}^3/$s for the $b

cascade the logic gates because most of these devices require current bias for
their operation. Therefore, these devices are not as convenient as the
semiconducting transistors to design logic gates. Here, to overcome these
challenges, we propose a ferroelectric SQUID (FeSQUID) based voltage-controlled
logic gates. FeSQUID exhibits two different critical current levels for two
different voltage-switchable polarization states of the ferroelectric. We
utilize the polarization-dependent (hence, voltage-controllable)
superconducting to resistive switching of FeSQUID to design Boolean logic gates
such as Copy, NOT, AND, and OR gates. The operations of these gates are
verified using a Verilog-A-based compact model of FeSQUID. Finally, to

Together with the ongoing progress on FeSQUID-based non-volatile memory, our
designed FeSQUID-based logic family will enable all-FeSQUID based cryogenic

given its inferred context, and corresponds with the N400 signal; and (B)
discrepancy signal, which reflects divergence between the true context and the

  Wildfire Danger Forecasting",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Climate change is expected to intensify and increase extreme events in the
weather cycle. Since this has a significant impact on various sectors of our
life, recent works are concerned with identifying and predicting such extreme
events from Earth observations. With respect to wildfire danger forecasting,
previous deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time
dimension and neglect the intrinsic differences between static and dynamic
variables. Furthermore, most existing multi-branch architectures lose the
interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To
address these issues, this paper proposes a 2D/3D two-branch convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a Location-aware Adaptive Normalization layer (LOAN).
Using LOAN as a building block, we can modulate the dynamic features
conditional on their geographical locations. Thus, our approach considers
feature properties as a unified yet compound 2D/3D model. Besides, we propose
using the sinusoidal-based encoding of the day of the year to provide the model
with explicit temporal information about the target day within the year. Our
experimental results show a better performance of our approach than other
baselines on the challenging FireCube dataset. The results show that
location-aware adaptive feature normalization is a promising technique to learn
the relation between dynamic variables and their geographic locations, which is
highly relevant for areas where remote sensing data builds the basis for
analysis. The source code is available at https://github.com/HakamShams/LOAN.

functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns
and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in many tasks.
Transferring knowledge from a source domain with abundant training data to a
target domain is effective for improving representation learning on scarce
training data. However, traditional transfer learning methods often fail to
generalize the pre-trained knowledge to the target task due to domain
discrepancy. Self-supervised learning on graphs can increase the
generalizability of graph features since self-supervision concentrates on
inherent graph properties that are not limited to a particular supervised task.
We propose a novel knowledge transfer strategy by integrating meta-learning
with self-supervised learning to deal with the heterogeneity and scarcity of
fMRI data. Specifically, we perform a self-supervised task on the source domain
and apply meta-learning, which strongly improves the generalizability of the
model using the bi-level optimization, to transfer the self-supervised
knowledge to the target domain. Through experiments on a neurological disorder
classification task, we demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly
improves target task performance by increasing the generalizability and
transferability of graph-based knowledge.

gaps between teacher-assigned and blindly-graded tests, and validate the
assessment-based measure with novel data on teachers' attitudes, as captured by
the Implicit Association Test (IAT). I develop a large-scale online portal
available to teachers and students in Peruvian public schools to collect IAT
scores nationwide. This analysis provides evidence that math teachers who
strongly associate males with scientific disciplines give higher scores to male
students, when compared to blindly-graded test scores, while language arts
teachers who strongly associate females with humanities-based disciplines award
higher grades to female students. Next, using graduation, college enrollment,
and matched employer-employee data on 1.7 million public high school students
who were expected to graduate between 2015 and 2019, I find that female
students who are assigned to more biased teachers are less likely to complete
high school and apply to college than male students. Moreover, female students
assigned to more biased teachers in high school are less likely to hold a job
in the formal sector after graduation and have fewer paid working hours
relative to their male classmates. Exposure to gender-biased teachers also
leads to monthly earnings losses for women, further exacerbating the gender pay

see the BAL effect only if the line of sight is within a spatially limited and

of view of the nucleus. The aim is to understand the theoretical mechanism
behind the massive outflow in BAL QSOs which is important for modelling the
impact of quasars onto the star formation rate in the host galaxy, and,
subsequently, onto the galaxy evolution. We apply the specific theoretical
model of dust-driven wind. The model has considerable predictive power. The
2.5D version of FRADO model of Czerny & Hryniewicz gives rise to the formation
of fast funnel-shaped outflow from the disk for a certain range of black hole
masses, Eddington ratios and metallicities. We now interpret BAL QSO as sources
viewed along the outflowing stream and we calculate the probabilities of seeing
the BAL phenomenon as functions of these global parameters, and we compare
these probabilities to those seen in the observational data. We include
considerations on the presence/absence of obscuring torus. Comparing our
theoretical results with observational data for a sample consisting of two
sub-populations of BAL and non-BAL QSOs we found that both in the model and in
the data the BAL phenomenon mostly happens for sources with black hole masses
larger than 10^{8} solar mass, the effect get stronger with accretion rate, and
also high metallicities are more likely in QSOs showing BAL features if the
presence of torus is taken into account. The consistency of the model with the
data provides support for the interpretation of the BAL phenomenon as the
result of the orientation of the source. It also supports the underlying
theoretical model although more consistency checks should be done in the
future.

introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a
diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even
with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a
sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D

through the use of `cut-throughs' of the atmosphere, that the atmosphere can be

equatorial region, and a transition region between the two. The location of
these regions as a function of latitude, longitude and altitude is
characterised. It is also found that the location of the transition region
changes for different magnetospheric disturbance levels, implying that the

However, finding an optimal patrolling strategy can be challenging for many
reasons. Firstly, patrolling environments are often complex and can include

or hardware constraints, such as limited battery life. Importantly, patrolling
large areas often requires multiple agents that need to collectively coordinate
their actions. In this work, we consider these limitations and propose an
approach based on model-free, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this
approach, the agents are trained to automatically recharge themselves when
required, to support continuous collective patrolling. A distributed
homogeneous multi-agent architecture is proposed, where all patrolling agents
execute identical policies locally based on their local observations and shared
information. This architecture provides a fault-tolerant and robust patrolling
system that can tolerate agent failures and allow supplementary agents to be
added to replace failed agents or to increase the overall patrol performance.
The solution is validated through simulation experiments from multiple
perspectives, including the overall patrol performance, the efficiency of
battery recharging strategies, and the overall fault tolerance and robustness.

irrespective of the magnitude of the system's response. In this paper, the
necessary conditions for a local optimum of the time-limited H2 norm of the
relative error system are derived. Inspired by these conditions, an oblique
projection algorithm is proposed that ensures small H2-norm relative error
within the desired time interval. Unlike the existing relative error-based
model reduction algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not require solutions
of large-scale Lyapunov and Riccati equations. The proposed algorithm is
compared with time-limited balanced truncation, time-limited balanced
stochastic truncation, and time-limited iterative Rational Krylov algorithm.
Numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm over these
existing algorithms.

between kinematics and chemistry can be explained by the existence of a
dynamically hotter, less centrally-concentrated, and more metal-poor population

develop a metallicity gradient before its accretion. Finally, we discovered
several carbon-enhanced metal-poor ($\rm[C/Fe] > +0.7$ and $\rm[Fe/H] \leq

calibration without end-to-end retraining, is a light and practical model
compression technique. Recently, several PTQ schemes for vision transformers
(ViTs) have been presented; unfortunately, they typically suffer from
non-trivial accuracy degradation, especially in low-bit cases. In this paper,
we propose RepQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for ViTs based on quantization scale
reparameterization, to address the above issues. RepQ-ViT decouples the
quantization and inference processes, where the former employs complex
quantizers and the latter employs scale-reparameterized simplified quantizers.
This ensures both accurate quantization and efficient inference, which
distinguishes it from existing approaches that sacrifice quantization
performance to meet the target hardware. More specifically, we focus on two
components with extreme distributions: post-LayerNorm activations with severe
inter-channel variation and post-Softmax activations with power-law features,
and initially apply channel-wise quantization and log$\sqrt{2}$ quantization,
respectively. Then, we reparameterize the scales to hardware-friendly
layer-wise quantization and log2 quantization for inference, with only slight
accuracy or computational costs. Extensive experiments are conducted on
multiple vision tasks with different model variants, proving that RepQ-ViT,
without hyperparameters and expensive reconstruction procedures, can outperform
existing strong baselines and encouragingly improve the accuracy of 4-bit PTQ
of ViTs to a usable level.

this paper, we report on an experimental study of the scaling law for the
three-body atomic loss rate $L_3$ near the narrow $s$-wave Feshbach resonance

with the scattering length $a<0$ is validated, where $L_3$ is scaling as

respresentation with the gas temperature $T$. The observation of such scaling
law is limited by two effects. When $a\rightarrow \infty$, the three-body
heating as well as the unitary behavior shifts the power-law relation to a more
smooth scattering length dependence. In the vicinity of $a\rightarrow 0$, we
study the finite range correction by deriving $L_3$ dependence on the effective
collision length $L_e$, and observe the finite range effects on the scaling

quantify the treatment effect on survival outcomes in randomized clinical

have been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
discussion about the power and sample size regarding the augmented version of
RMST-based tests, which utilize baseline covariates for a gain in estimation
efficiency and in power for testing the no treatment effect. The conventional
event-driven study design based on the log-rank test allows us to calculate the
power for a given hazard ratio without specifying the survival functions. In
contrast, the existing sample size determination methods for the RMST-based
tests relies on the adequacy of the assumptions of the entire survival curves
of two groups. Furthermore, to handle the augmented test, the correlation
between the baseline covariates and the martingale residuals must be handled.
To address these issues, we propose an approximated sample size formula for the
augmented version of the RMST-based test, which does not require specifying the
entire survival curve in the treatment group, and also a sample size
recalculation approach to update the correlations between the baseline
covariates and the martingale residuals with the blinded data. The proposed
procedure will enable the studies to have the target power for a given RMST

feedforward neural network block, which takes as input the parameters of the QP

accretion, we present a detailed analysis of 24 low and possible accretors,
previously identified using the He I $\lambda$10830 line. We model
moderate-resolution H$\alpha$ profiles of these stars using magnetospheric
accretion flow models that account for the chromospheric contribution at the
line center. Based on parameters derived from the fits of 20 stars that can be
reproduced with the models, we find a power-law relation between the disk
truncation radius and the mass accretion rate consistent with predictions from
theory and simulations. Comparing the corotation and truncation radii, we find
that most of our targets are accreting in the unstable regime and rule out the
propeller as the main process stopping accretion. For the truncation radius to
be the same as the magnetic radius, the dipole magnetic field and/or the
efficiency parameter $\xi$ need to be smaller than previously determined,
suggesting that higher-order fields dominate in low accretion rates. Lastly, we
determine that the lowest accretion rates that can be detected by H$\alpha$
line modeling are $1-3\times10^{-11}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ for M3 stars and
$3-5\times10^{-11}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ for K5 stars. These limits are lower than

improvement than that with greatly varying time interval. Therefore, we propose

nuclei, the profuse low-energy antineutrinos from $\beta$-decay of the
newly-synthesized nuclei can annihilate the HE neutrinos. Considering HE
neutrinos produced at internal shocks induced by intermittent mildly-magnetized
jets, we show that such annihilation suppresses the overall HE neutrino
spectrum at $\gtrsim 300$~TeV and produces a corresponding flavor composition
of $(F_{\nu_e+\bar\nu_e}: F_{\nu_\mu+\bar\nu_\mu}:
F_{\nu_\tau+\bar\nu_\tau})_\star \approx (1 : 10 : 1)$ at source. We find that
the emergent HE neutrino flux can well fit the diffuse flux observed at IceCube
if contributions from all similar sources are taken into account. Our results
highlight the unique role of HE neutrinos in supporting collapsars as sources
for $r$-process nuclei, and can be tested by accurate measurement of the
diffuse HE neutrino flux spectrum and flavor composition, as well as detection
of HE neutrinos from individual sources.

further updated by adjusting the rescaling factor in a self-consistent

clients) to learn a global model without sharing the local datasets, where each
client performs gradient descent with its local data and uploads the gradients
to a central server to update the global model. However, FL faces massive
communication overhead resulted from uploading the gradients in each training
round. To address this problem, most existing research compresses the gradients
with fixed and unified quantization for all the clients, which neither seeks
adaptive quantization due to the varying gradient norms at different rounds,
nor exploits the heterogeneity of the clients to accelerate FL. In this paper,
we propose a novel adaptive and heterogeneous gradient quantization algorithm
(AdaGQ) for FL to minimize the wall-clock training time from two aspects: i)
adaptive quantization which exploits the change of gradient norm to adjust the
quantization resolution in each training round; and ii) heterogeneous
quantization which assigns lower quantization resolution to slow clients to
align their training time with other clients to mitigate the communication
bottleneck, and higher quantization resolution to fast clients to achieve a
better communication efficiency and accuracy tradeoff. Evaluations based on
various models and datasets validate the benefits of AdaGQ, reducing the total
training time by up to 52.1% compared to baseline algorithms (e.g., FedAvg,

Communication Systems (ACSs) are proposed to hide the relationship between
transmitted messages and their senders and receivers, providing privacy
properties known as anonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability. This article
aims to review research in the ACSs field, focusing on Dining Cryptographers
Networks (DCNs). The DCN-based methods are information-theoretically secure and
thus provide unconditional unobservability guarantees. Their adoption for
anonymous communications was initially hindered because their computational and
communication overhead was deemed significant at that time, and scalability
problems occurred. However, more recent contributions, such as the possibility
to transmit messages of arbitrary length, efficient disruption handling and
overhead improvements, have made the integration of modern DCN-based methods
more realistic. In addition, the literature does not follow a common definition
for privacy properties, making it hard to compare the approaches' gains.
Therefore, this survey contributes to introducing a harmonized terminology for
ACS privacy properties, then presents an overview of the underlying principles
of ACSs, in particular, DCN-based methods, and finally, investigates their
alignment with the new harmonized privacy terminologies. Previous surveys did
not cover the most recent research advances in the ACS area or focus on
DCN-based methods. Our comprehensive investigation closes this gap by providing
visual maps to highlight privacy properties and discussing the most promising

required task across many scientific disciplines. The sensor selection problem,
which aims to optimize the placement of sensors, leverages innovations in

model-based information and sparsely observed measurements to collectively make
an estimation, with many related optimization algorithms developed for
selecting optimal sensors. The majority of methods have been developed for
stationary sensors, with relatively limited work estimating spatiotemporal data
using mobile sensors that leverage both Kalman filtering and low-rank features.
We show that mobile sensing along dynamic trajectories can achieve the
equivalent performance of a larger number of stationary sensors, with
performance gains related to three distinct timescales: (i) the timescale of
the spatio-temporal dynamics, (ii) the velocity of the sensors, and (iii) the
rate of sampling. Taken together, these timescales strongly influence how
well-conditioned the estimation task is. Mobile sensing is particularly
effective for spatio-temporal data that contain spatially localized structures,
whose features are captured along dynamic trajectories. We draw connections

enhances the semantic corresponding relations between the local and global

finetuning. With extensive empirical analysis we find that language models
learn more reasoning skills such as textual entailment, abductive reasoning,

a sequence of events. Based on such knowledge, script event prediction aims to
predict the subsequent event. To do so, two aspects should be considered for
events, namely, event description (i.e., what the events should contain) and
event encoding (i.e., how they should be encoded). Most existing methods
describe an event by a verb together with only a few core arguments (i.e.,
subject, object, and indirect object), which are not precise. In addition,
existing event encoders are limited to a fixed number of arguments, which are
not flexible to deal with extra information. Thus, in this paper, we propose
the Rich Event Prediction (REP) framework for script event prediction.
Fundamentally, it is based on the proposed rich event description, which
enriches the existing ones with three kinds of important information, namely,
the senses of verbs, extra semantic roles, and types of participants. REP
contains an event extractor to extract such information from texts. Based on
the extracted rich information, a predictor then selects the most probable
subsequent event. The core component of the predictor is a transformer-based
event encoder to flexibly deal with an arbitrary number of arguments.
Experimental results on the widely used Gigaword Corpus show the effectiveness
of the proposed framework.

to activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent,
causing the partial activation issue which inevitably leads to missing or
redundant regions of objects. In this paper, we argue that partial activation
is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution
operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture
long-range feature dependency among image regions. In order to obtain feature
maps that could activate full object extent, keeping the segmental results from
being overwhelmed by noisy features, a novel framework termed Cross-Model
Detail Querying network (DQnet) is proposed. It reasons the relations between
long-range-aware representations and multi-scale local details to make the
enhanced representation fully highlight the object regions and eliminate noise
on non-object regions. Specifically, a vanilla ViT pretrained with
self-supervised learning (SSL) is employed to model long-range dependencies
among image regions. A ResNet is employed to enable learning fine-grained
spatial local details in multiple scales. Then, to effectively retrieve
object-related details, a Relation-Based Querying (RBQ) module is proposed to
explore window-based interactions between the global representations and the
multi-scale local details. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely

major bottleneck in restricting the performance of the MEC. Fortunately,
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can alleviate this problem since it
can boost both the spectrum- and energy- efficiency. Different from the
existing works adopting either fully active or fully passive RIS, we propose a
novel hybrid RIS in which reflecting units can flexibly switch between active
and passive modes. To achieve a tradeoff between the latency and energy
consumption, an optimization problem is formulated by minimizing the total
cost. In light of the intractability of the problem, we develop an alternating
optimization-based iterative algorithm by combining the successive convex
approximation method, the variable substitution, and the singular value
decomposition (SVD) to obtain sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, in order to
gain more insight into the problem, we consider two special cases involving a
latency minimization problem and an energy consumption minimization problem,

deal with the discontinuities in the strain fields at common boundaries of
pile-soil regions and soil layers. The application of the model to the analysis
and parametric study of single piles embedded in both homogeneous and layered
formations is demonstrated under axisymmetric and plane strain conditions. The
performance of the model in parameter identification (inverse analysis) of
pile-soil interaction is particularly investigated. It is shown that by using
PINNs, the localized data acquired along the pile length - possibly obtained
via fiber optic strain sensing - can be successfully used for the inversion of
soil parameters in layered formations.

one-one-mapping property of invertible transformations. Experiments on

promising solution to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless communication
networks. Despite their many advantages, FA-enabled communications have
limitations as they require an enormous amount of spectral resources in order
to select the most desirable position of the radiating element from a large
number of prescribed locations. In this paper, we present an analytical
framework for the outage performance of large-scale FA-enabled communications,
where all user equipments (UEs) employ circular multi-FA array. In contrast to
existing studies, which assume perfect channel state information, the developed
framework accurately captures the channel estimation errors on the performance
of the considered network deployments. In particular, we focus on the limited
coherence interval scenario, where a novel sequential linear minimum
mean-squared error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation method is performed for
only a very small number of FA ports. Next, for the communication of each BS
with its associated UE, a low-complexity port-selection technique is employed,
where the port that provides the highest
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is selected among the ports that are
estimated to provide the strongest channel from each FA. By using stochastic
geometry tools, we derive both analytical and closed-form expressions for the
outage probability, highlighting the impact of channel estimation on the
performance of FA-based UEs. Our results reveal the trade-off imposed between
improving the network's performance and reducing the channel estimation
quality, indicating new insights for the design of FA-enabled communications.

The Lorentz force of the barotropic star is purely irrotational and the

of the magnetic fields are less restricted. We find that the minor solenoidal
component in the elastic crust is important for sustaining the strong magnetic
field in the core. Unlike previous studies, the toroidal magnetic field exists
in the entire region of the core, and we obtain equilibrium states with large
toroidal magnetic fields, where the toroidal magnetic energy is larger than the

distribution from the perspective of a percolation model by regarding the
number of aggregations as the number of attached bonds. Specifically, we derive
the scaling form of the cluster size distribution with specific values of the
critical exponents using the property that the characteristic cluster size
diverges as the percolation threshold is approached from below. Through
simulation, it is confirmed that the scaling form well explains the evolution
of the cluster size distribution. Based on the distribution behavior, we find
that a giant cluster of all oscillators is formed discontinuously at the
threshold and also that further aggregation does not occur like in a
one-dimensional bond percolation model. Finally, we discuss the origin of the
discontinuous formation of the giant cluster from the perspective of global
suppression in explosive percolation models. For this, we approximate the
aggregation process as a cluster--cluster aggregation with a given collision

Krivelevich, Lee and Sudakov proposed a more general notion of incompatibility
system to formulate the robustness of Hamiltonicity of Dirac graphs. Given a

family $\mathcal{F}=\{F_v\}_{v\in V}$ such that for every $v\in V$, $F_v$ is a
family of edge pairs in $\{\{e,e'\}: e\ne e'\in E, e\cap e'=\{v\}\}$. An
incompatibility system $\mathcal{F}$ is \emph{$\Delta$-bounded} if for every
vertex $v$ and every edge $e$ incident with $v$, there are at most $\Delta$
pairs in $F_v$ containing $e$. A subgraph $H$ of $G$ is \emph{compatible} (with
respect to $\mathcal{F}$) if every pair of adjacent edges $e,e'$ of $H$
satisfies $\{e,e'\} \notin F_v$, where $v=e\cap e'$. Krivelevich, Lee and

of WDM is given by its electronic density response to an external perturbation.
Such response properties are routinely probed in x-ray Thomson scattering
(XRTS) experiments, and, in addition, are central for the theoretical
description of WDM. In this work, we give an overview of a number of recent
developments in this field. To this end, we summarize the relevant theoretical
background, covering the regime of linear-response theory as well as nonlinear
effects, the fully dynamic response and its static, time-independent limit, and
the connection between density response properties and imaginary-time
correlation functions (ITCF). In addition, we introduce the most important
numerical simulation techniques including ab initio path integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC) simulations and different thermal density functional theory (DFT)
approaches. From a practical perspective, we present a variety of simulation
results for different density response properties, covering the archetypal
model of the uniform electron gas and realistic WDM systems such as hydrogen.
Moreover, we show how the concept of ITCFs can be used to infer the temperature
from XRTS measurements of arbitrarily complex systems without the need for any
models or approximations. Finally, we outline a strategy for future
developments based on the close interplay between simulations and experiments.

such incremental learning scenarios, neural networks are known to suffer
catastrophic forgetting: easily forgetting previously seen data after training

limited by either low performance or memory scalability issues. As such, we
develop a Memory-Efficient Incremental Learning algorithm for NeRF (MEIL-NeRF).
MEIL-NeRF takes inspiration from NeRF itself in that a neural network can serve
as a memory that provides the pixel RGB values, given rays as queries. Upon the
motivation, our framework learns which rays to query NeRF to extract previous
pixel values. The extracted pixel values are then used to train NeRF in a
self-distillation manner to prevent catastrophic forgetting. As a result,
MEIL-NeRF demonstrates constant memory consumption and competitive performance.

attention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input
tokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning

learned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a
novel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the
evolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual
convolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the
attention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a
residual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token
relationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an
evolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it
is beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this
process. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced
evolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various
applications, including time-series representation, natural language
understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on
time-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated

produced by a detector that extracts potential object locations from the raw

step reduces data flow and computational complexity but may result in a loss of

fully model-based approach, BP can only provide suboptimal estimates when there

monotonicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
convergence of the Nesterov's accelerated protocol is proved for variational

A submonoid of the nonnegative cone of a totally ordered abelian group is often

  Speech Separation",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, frequency domain all-neural beamforming methods have achieved
remarkable progress for multichannel speech separation. In parallel, the
integration of time domain network structure and beamforming also gains
significant attention. This study proposes a novel all-neural beamforming
method in time domain and makes an attempt to unify the all-neural beamforming
pipelines for time domain and frequency domain multichannel speech separation.
The proposed model consists of two modules: separation and beamforming. Both
modules perform temporal-spectral-spatial modeling and are trained from
end-to-end using a joint loss function. The novelty of this study lies in two
folds. Firstly, a time domain directional feature conditioned on the direction
of the target speaker is proposed, which can be jointly optimized within the
time domain architecture to enhance target signal estimation. Secondly, an
all-neural beamforming network in time domain is designed to refine the
pre-separated results. This module features with parametric time-variant
beamforming coefficient estimation, without explicitly following the derivation
of optimal filters that may lead to an upper bound. The proposed method is
evaluated on simulated reverberant overlapped speech data derived from the
AISHELL-1 corpus. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over frequency domain state-of-the-arts, ideal magnitude masks and
existing time domain neural beamforming methods.

  Framework",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used for model compression and
knowledge transfer. Typically, a big teacher model trained on sufficient data
transfers knowledge to a small student model. However, despite the success of
KD, little effort has been made to study whether KD leaks the training data of
the teacher model. In this paper, we experimentally reveal that KD suffers from
the risk of privacy leakage. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel
knowledge distillation method, swing distillation, which can effectively
protect the private information of the teacher model from flowing to the
student model. In our framework, the temperature coefficient is dynamically and
adaptively adjusted according to the degree of private information contained in
the data, rather than a predefined constant hyperparameter. It assigns
different temperatures to tokens according to the likelihood that a token in a
position contains private information. In addition, we inject noise into soft
targets provided to the student model, in order to avoid unshielded knowledge
transfer. Experiments on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate that the
proposed swing distillation can significantly reduce (by over 80% in terms of
canary exposure) the risk of privacy leakage in comparison to KD with
competitive or better performance. Furthermore, swing distillation is robust
against the increasing privacy budget.

datasets by handling two shifts: domain-shift and category-shift. The main
challenge is correctly distinguishing the unknown target samples while adapting
the distribution of known class knowledge from source to target. Most existing
methods approach this problem by first training the target adapted known
classifier and then relying on the single threshold to distinguish unknown
target samples. However, this simple threshold-based approach prevents the
model from considering the underlying complexities existing between the known
and unknown samples in the high-dimensional feature space. In this paper, we
propose a new approach in which we use two sets of feature points, namely dual
Classifiers for Prototypes and Reciprocals (CPR). Our key idea is to associate
each prototype with corresponding known class features while pushing the
reciprocals apart from these prototypes to locate them in the potential unknown
feature space. The target samples are then classified as unknown if they fall
near any reciprocals at test time. To successfully train our framework, we
collect the partial, confident target samples that are classified as known or
unknown through on our proposed multi-criteria selection. We then additionally
apply the entropy loss regularization to them. For further adaptation, we also
apply standard consistency regularization that matches the predictions of two
different views of the input to make more compact target feature space. We
evaluate our proposal, CPR, on three standard benchmarks and achieve comparable
or new state-of-the-art results. We also provide extensive ablation experiments
to verify our main design choices in our framework.

test-time adaptation (TTA) allows the model to adapt itself to novel

adaptation). Several works for TTA have shown promising adaptation performances
in continuously changing environments. However, our investigation reveals that
existing methods are vulnerable to dynamic distributional changes and often
lead to overfitting of TTA models. To address this problem, this paper first
presents a robust TTA framework with compound domain knowledge management. Our
framework helps the TTA model to harvest the knowledge of multiple
representative domains (i.e., compound domain) and conduct the TTA based on the
compound domain knowledge. In addition, to prevent overfitting of the TTA
model, we devise novel regularization which modulates the adaptation rates
using domain-similarity between the source and the current target domain. With
the synergy of the proposed framework and regularization, we achieve consistent
performance improvements in diverse TTA scenarios, especially on dynamic domain

analyze the variability of heart rate variability. Although the variation of
physiological status of cardiovascular system can be shown graphically by the
second-order difference plot, the descriptive ability of existing indicators
for this plot is insufficient. As a result, the physiological information
contained in the second-order difference plot cannot be extracted adequately.
Addressing the problem, the temporal variation measure analysis is presented to
describe distribution patterns of scatter points in the second-order difference

decades and are also quite popular with statistics users because of their
technical simplicity. The Bonferroni procedure has been one of the earliest and
most prominent testing rules for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER).
A recent article established that the FWER for the Bonferroni method
asymptotically (i.e., when the number of hypotheses becomes arbitrarily large)
approaches zero under any positively equicorrelated multivariate normal
framework. However, similar results for the limiting behaviors of FWER of
general stepwise procedures are nonexistent. The present work addresses this
gap in a unified manner by studying the limiting behaviors of the FWER of
several stepwise testing rules for correlated normal setups. Specifically, we
show that the limiting FWER approaches zero for any step-down rule (e.g.,
Holm's method) provided the infimum of the correlations is strictly positive.
We also establish similar limiting zero results on FWER of other popular
multiple testing rules, e.g., Hochberg's and Hommel's procedures. We then
extend these results to any configuration of true and false null hypotheses. It
turns out that, within our chosen asymptotic framework, the Benjamini-Hochberg
method can hold the FWER at a strictly positive level asymptotically under the
equicorrelated normality. We finally discuss the limiting powers of various
procedures.

real-valued model output into calibrated statistical distributions, based
solely on training data of model output-outcome pairs, without any need to
access model input. In its basic form, EasyUQ is a special case of the recently
introduced Isotonic Distributional Regression (IDR) technique that leverages
the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm for nonparametric isotonic regression.
EasyUQ yields discrete predictive distributions that are calibrated and optimal
in finite samples, subject to stochastic monotonicity. The workflow is fully
automated, without any need for tuning. The Smooth EasyUQ approach supplements
IDR with kernel smoothing, to yield continuous predictive distributions that
preserve key properties of the basic form, including both, stochastic
monotonicity with respect to the original model output, and asymptotic
consistency. For the selection of kernel parameters, we introduce multiple
one-fit grid search, a computationally much less demanding approximation to
leave-one-out cross-validation. We use simulation examples and the WeatherBench

that good augmentations are label-preserving with respect to a specific

augmentations can be useful in the foundation model setting, where the goal is
to learn diverse, general-purpose representations for multiple downstream
tasks. We perform contrastive learning experiments on a range of image and
audio datasets with multiple downstream tasks (e.g. for digits superimposed on
photographs, predicting the class of one vs. the other). We find that Viewmaker
Networks, a recently proposed model for learning augmentations for contrastive
learning, produce label-destroying augmentations that stochastically destroy
features needed for different downstream tasks. These augmentations are
interpretable (e.g. altering shapes, digits, or letters added to images) and
surprisingly often result in better performance compared to expert-designed
augmentations, despite not preserving label information. To support our
empirical results, we theoretically analyze a simple contrastive learning
setting with a linear model. In this setting, label-destroying augmentations
are crucial for preventing one set of features from suppressing the learning of
features useful for another downstream task. Our results highlight the need for
analyzing the interaction between multiple downstream tasks when trying to
explain the success of foundation models.

with label noise. Based on the estimated noise transition matrix and the noisy
posterior probabilities, the clean posterior probabilities, which are jointly
called Label Distribution (LD) in this paper, can be calculated as the
supervision. To reliably estimate the noise transition matrix, some methods
assume that anchor points are available during training. Nonetheless, if anchor
points are invalid, the noise transition matrix might be poorly learned,
resulting in poor performance. Consequently, other methods treat reliable data
points, extracted from training data, as pseudo anchor points. However, from a
statistical point of view, the noise transition matrix can be inferred from
data with noisy labels under the clean-label-domination assumption. Therefore,
we aim to estimate the noise transition matrix without (pseudo) anchor points.
There is evidence showing that samples are more likely to be mislabeled as
other similar class labels, which means the mislabeling probability is highly
correlated with the inter-class correlation. Inspired by this observation, we
propose an instance-specific Label Distribution Regularization (LDR), in which
the instance-specific LD is estimated as the supervision, to prevent DCNNs from
memorizing noisy labels. Specifically, we estimate the noisy posterior under
the supervision of noisy labels, and approximate the batch-level noise
transition matrix by estimating the inter-class correlation matrix with neither
anchor points nor pseudo anchor points. Experimental results on two synthetic
noisy datasets and two real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that our LDR
outperforms existing methods.

efforts leveraging freely available data. In this paper we present a
comprehensive head-to-head comparison of language models for Spanish with the
following results: (i) Previously ignored multilingual models from large
companies fare better than monolingual models, substantially changing the
evaluation landscape of language models in Spanish; (ii) Results across the
monolingual models are not conclusive, with supposedly smaller and inferior
models performing competitively. Based on these empirical results, we argue for
the need of more research to understand the factors underlying them. In this
sense, the effect of corpus size, quality and pre-training techniques need to
be further investigated to be able to obtain Spanish monolingual models
significantly better than the multilingual ones released by large private
companies, specially in the face of rapid ongoing progress in the field. The
recent activity in the development of language technology for Spanish is to be
welcomed, but our results show that building language models remains an open,
resource-heavy problem which requires to marry resources (monetary and/or
computational) with the best research expertise and practice.

viewed as a more efficient promising technique to combat the double-fading

achievable rate of user in such a wireless network, three enhanced-rate
iterative beamforming methods are proposed by designing the amplifying factors
and the corresponding phases at active IRS. The first method, maximizing the
simplified signal-to-noise ratio (Max-SSNR) is designed by omitting the
cross-term in the definition of rate. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz (RR) theorem,
Max-SSNR-RR is proposed to iteratively optimize the norm of beamforming vector
and its associated normalized vector. In addition, generalized maximum ratio
reflection (GMRR) is presented with a closed-form expression, which is
motivated by the maximum ratio combining. To further improve rate, maximizing
SNR (Max-SNR) is designed by fractional programming (FP), which is called
Max-SNR-FP. Simulation results show that the proposed three methods make an
obvious rate enhancement over Max-reflecting signal-to-noise ratio (Max-RSNR),
maximum ratio reflection (MRR), selective ratio reflecting (SRR), equal gain
reflection (EGR) and passive IRS, and are in increasing order of rate
performance as follows: Max-SSNR-RR, GMRR, and Max-SNR-FP.

millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands plays an important role in
supporting extreme high beamforming gain as well as ultra-wideband spectrum
resources. Unfortunately, accurate wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation suffers
from the new challenge called as the near-field beam split effect. Prior works
either neglect the accurate near-field channel model or fail to exploit the
beam split effect, resulting in poor channel estimation accuracy for wideband
XL-MIMO. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a bilinear pattern
detection (BPD) based approach to accurately recover the wideband XL-MIMO
channel. Specifically, by analyzing the characteristics of near-field wideband
channels, we first reveal the bilinear pattern of the near-field beam split
effect, which implies that the sparse support set of near-field channels in
both the angle and the distance domains can be regarded as a linear function
against frequency. Then, inspired by the classical simultaneously orthogonal
matching pursuit technique, we use the bilinear pattern to estimate the
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and distance parameters of each near-field path
component at all frequencies. In this way, the entire wideband XL-MIMO channel
can be recovered by compressed sensing algorithms. Moreover, we provide the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm compared with existing
algorithms. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve
the accurate estimation of the near-field wideband XL-MIMO channel in the
presence of near-field beam split effect.

triangulations of cyclic polytopes and the higher Auslander algebras of type
$A$, denoted $A_{n}^{d}$, is an incredibly rich one. The \emph{higher
Stasheff--Tamari orders} are two orders on triangulations of cyclic polytopes,
conjectured to be equivalent, defined in the 1990s by Kapranov and Voevodsky,
and Edelman and Reiner. We first show that these orders correspond in even
dimensions to natural orders on tilting modules defined by Riedtmann and
Schofield and studied by Happel and Unger. This result allows us to show that
triangulations of odd-dimensional cyclic polytopes are in bijection with
equivalence classes of $d$-maximal green sequences of $A_{n}^{d}$, which we
introduce as a higher-dimensional generalisation of the original maximal green
sequences of Keller. We further interpret the higher Stasheff--Tamari orders in
odd dimensions, where they correspond to natural orders on equivalences classes
of $d$-maximal green sequences. The conjecture that these two partial orders on
equivalence classes of $d$-maximal green sequences are equal amounts to an
oriented version of the ``no-gap'' conjecture of Br\""ustle, Dupont, and
Perotin. A corollary of our results is that this conjecture holds for $A_{n}$,
and that here the set of equivalence classes of (1-)maximal green sequences is
a lattice.

of interest (ROIs). However, they always cover a diverse set of structures,
causing difficulties for the segmentation model to learn good decision
boundaries with high sensitivity and precision. The issue concerns the highly
heterogeneous nature of the background class, resulting in multi-modal
distributions. Empirically, we find that neural networks trained with
heterogeneous background struggle to map the corresponding contextual samples
to compact clusters in feature space. As a result, the distribution over
background logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, leading to
systematic over-segmentation across different datasets and tasks. In this
study, we propose context label learning (CoLab) to improve the context
representations by decomposing the background class into several subclasses.
Specifically, we train an auxiliary network as a task generator, along with the
primary segmentation model, to automatically generate context labels that
positively affect the ROI segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments are
conducted on several challenging segmentation tasks and datasets. The results
demonstrate that CoLab can guide the segmentation model to map the logits of
background samples away from the decision boundary, resulting in significantly
improved segmentation accuracy. Code is available.

semiconductors is a computational challenge. Here, we describe delocalised
kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC), the first model of three-dimensional exciton
transport in organic semiconductors that includes delocalisation, disorder, and
polaron formation. We find that delocalisation can dramatically increase
exciton transport; for example, delocalisation across less than two molecules
in each direction can increase the exciton diffusion coefficient by over an
order of magnitude. The mechanism for the enhancement is twofold:
delocalisation enables excitons both to hop more frequently and further in each
hop. We also quantify the effect of transient delocalisation (short-lived
periods where excitons become highly delocalised), and show it depends strongly
on the disorder and the transition dipole moments.

atomically thin interfaces of Ir/Al2O3 heterostructures compatible with
micro-optoelectronic technologies are reported. Their structural and optical
properties were determined by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques (XRR,
XPS, HRTEM, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometry). The
XRR and HRTEM analyses reveal a layer-by-layer growth mechanism of Ir in atomic
scale heterostructures, which is different from the typical island-type growth
of metals on dielectrics. Alongside, XPS investigations imply the formation of
Ir-O-Al bonding at the interfaces for lower Ir concentrations, in contrast to
the nanoparticle core-shell structure formation. Precisely tuning the ratio of
the constituents ensures the control of the dispersion profile along with a
transition from effective dielectric to metallic heterostructures. The Ir
coating thickness was varied ranging from a few {\AA} to films of about 7 nm in
the heterostructures. The transition has been observed in the structures
containing individual Ir coating thicknesses of about 2-4 nm. Following this,
show epsilon-near-zero metamaterials with tunable dielectric constants by
precisely varying the composition of such heterostructures. Overall, a
comprehensive study on structural and optical properties of the

16293-2422 A (sep <100 au) down to ~10 au scales. The circumbinary material's
spectral index, alpha, has a median of 3.1 and a dispersion of ~0.2, providing
no firm evidence of mm-sizes grains therein. Continuum substructures with
brightness temperature peaks of T_b~60-80 K at 1.3 mm are observed near the
disks at both wavelengths. These peaks do not overlap with strong variations of
alpha, indicating they trace high-temperature spots instead of regions with
significant optical depth variations. The lower limits to the inferred dust
temperature in the hot spots are 122, 87 and 49 K. Depending on the assumed
dust opacity index, these values can be several times higher. They overlap with
high gas temperatures and enhanced complex organic molecular (COM) emission.
This newly resolved dust temperature distribution is in better agreement with
the expectations from mechanical instead of the most commonly assumed radiative
heating. In particular, we find that the temperatures agree with shock heating
predictions. This evidence and recent studies highlighting accretion heating in
Class 0 disks suggest that mechanical heating (shocks, dissipation powered by
accretion, etc.) is important during the early stages and should be considered
when modeling and measuring properties of deeply embedded protostars and disks.

for optimising energy efficient operation. Distributed control of fluid systems
combines reliable local control of components while using system-wide
cooperation to ensure energy efficient operation. The presented work compares
three approaches to distributed control based on multi-agent systems,
distributed model predictive control (DMPC), multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MADRL) and market mechanism design. These approaches were applied to
a generic fluid system and evaluated with regard to functionality, energy
efficient operation, modeling effort, reliability in the face of disruptions,
and transparency of control decisions. All approaches were shown to fulfil the
functionality, though a trade-off between functional quality and energy
efficiency was identified. Increased modeling effort was shown to improve the
performance slightly while a strong interdependence of information caused by
excessive information sharing has proven to be disadvantageous. DMPC and
partially observable MADRL were less sensitive to disruptions than market
mechanism. In conclusion, agent-based control of fluid systems achieves greater
energy efficiency than conventional methods, with values similar to centralized
optimal control and thus represent a viable design approach of fluid system
control.

apply here a first-principles approach to exciton dynamics resulting from

excitons, which leads to a surprisingly long lifetime of the lowest energy

rigorously require a second-order perturbation theory approach, with photon and
phonon treated on an equal footing, as proposed by Toyozawa and Hopfield. Such
a treatment, thus far neglected in first-principles studies, gives rise to
off-diagonal exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements, which are critical for
the description of dephasing mechanisms, and yields exciton linewidths in

though its nature is yet unclear. The source has shown two consecutive flaring
episodes in the optical and the infrared bands and its second flare was covered
by X-ray monitoring programs. During this flare, the UVOT/Swift photometries
revealed two plateaus: one observed after the peak and the other one appeared
~240 days later. Meanwhile, our NICER and XRT/Swift campaigns show two declines
in the X-ray emission, one during the first optical plateau and one 70-90 days
after the optical/UV decline. The evidence suggests that the optical/UV could
not have been primarily originated from X-ray reprocessing. Furthermore, we
detected a timelag of ~16-34 days between the optical and UV emission, which
indicates the optical likely comes from UV reprocessing by a gas at a distance
of 0.01-0.03 pc. We also report the first VLA and VLBA detection of this source
at different frequencies and different stages of the second flare. The
information obtained in the radio band - namely a steep and a late-time
inverted radio spectrum, a high brightness temperature and a radio-loud state
at late times - together with the multiwavelength properties of AT 2019avd
suggests the launching and evolution of outflows such as disc winds or jets. In
conclusion, we propose that after the ignition of black hole activity in the
first flare, a super-Eddington flaring accretion disc formed and settled to a
sub-Eddington state by the end of the second flare, associated with a compact
radio outflow.

chromosome capture methods such as Hi-C that measure the contact frequencies
between all DNA segment pairs across the genome. As Hi-C data sets often are
massive, it is common to use bioinformatics methods to group DNA segments into
3D regions with correlated contact patterns, such as Topologically Associated
Domains (TADs) and A/B compartments. Recently, another research direction
emerged that treats the Hi-C data as a network of 3D contacts. In this
representation, one can use community detection algorithms from complex network
theory that group nodes into tightly connected mesoscale communities. However,
because Hi-C networks are so densely connected, several node partitions may
represent feasible solutions to the community detection problem but are
indistinguishable unless including other data. Because this limitation is a
fundamental property of the network, this problem persists regardless of the
community-finding or data-clustering method. To help remedy this problem, we
developed a method that charts the solution landscape of network partitions in
Hi-C data from human cells. Our approach allows us to scan seamlessly through
the scales of the network and determine regimes where we can expect reliable
community structures. We find that some scales are more robust than others and
that strong clusters may differ significantly. Our work highlights that finding
a robust community structure hinges on thoughtful algorithm design or method
cross-evaluation.

turbulence, i.e., $Nu \sim Ra^\beta$ with $\beta \approx 0.3$ in the classical
and $\beta=1/2$ in the ultimate regime, where the Nusselt number $Nu$ measures
the global heat transport and the Rayleigh number $Ra$ quantifies the strength
of thermal forcing. In recent years, vibroconvective flows have been attractive
due to its ability to drive flow instability and generate ``artificial
gravity'', which have potential to effective heat and mass transport in
microgravity. However, the existence of constitutive laws in vibroconvective
turbulence remains unclear. To address this issue, we carry out direct
numerical simulations in a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, and report
that the heat transport exhibits a universal scaling law $Nu \sim a^{-1}
Re_\mathrm{os}^\beta$ where $a$ is the vibration amplitude, $Re_\mathrm{os}$ is
the oscillational Reynolds number, and $\beta$ is the universal exponent. We
find that the dynamics of boundary layers plays an essential role in
vibroconvective heat transport, and the $Nu$-scaling exponent $\beta$ is
determined by the competition between the thermal boundary layer (TBL) and
vibration-induced oscillating boundary layer (OBL). Then a physical model is
proposed to explain the change of scaling exponent from $\beta=2$ in the
OBL-dominant regime to $\beta = 4/3$ in the TBL-dominant regime. We conclude
that vibroconvective turbulence in microgravity defines a distinct universality
class of convective turbulence. This work elucidates the emergence of universal
constitutive laws in vibroconvective turbulence, and opens up a new avenue for
generating a controllable effective heat transport under microgravity or even
microfluidic environment in which gravity is nearly absent.

model fits in the class of scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs whose
asymptotic geometrical features have been recently attracting interest. While
for this type of graphs several results are known when the underlying vertex

distributions of the typical degrees and some related observables. In
particular, we show that the degree of a vertex converges in distribution,
after proper scaling, to a mixed Poisson law. We then show that correlations
among degrees of different vertices are asymptotically non-vanishing, but at
the same time a form of asymptotic tail independence is found when looking at
the behavior of the joint Laplace transform around zero. Moreover, we present
some findings concerning the asymptotic density of wedges and triangles, show a

present a novel task named free-form 3D scene inpainting. Unlike scenes in
previous 3D completion datasets preserving most of the main structures and
hints of detailed shapes around missing regions, the proposed inpainting

well on this challenging yet practical task, simply interpolating nearby

discriminator regularizes the geometry and color edges of the predicted scenes
to be realistic and sharp. We conducted experiments with the proposed

melting. This differential ablation deforms the ice surface and induces a quasi
static flow of grains that leads to a conic shape, as the thermal length become
small compared to the structure size. The cone grows until it reaches a steady

task due to a lack of inherent characteristics, imprecise bounding box
regression, a scarcity of real-world datasets, and sensitive localization
evaluation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we find that the existing anchor-free label assignment
method is prone to mislabeling small targets as background, leading to their
omission by detectors. To overcome this issue, we propose an all-scale
pseudo-box-based label assignment scheme that relaxes the constraints on scale
and decouples the spatial assignment from the size of the ground-truth target.
Second, motivated by the structured prior of feature pyramids, we introduce the
one-stage cascade refinement network (OSCAR), which uses the high-level head as
soft proposals for the low-level refinement head. This allows OSCAR to process
the same target in a cascade coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we present a new
research benchmark for infrared small target detection, consisting of the
SIRST-V2 dataset of real-world, high-resolution single-frame targets, the
normalized contrast evaluation metric, and the DeepInfrared toolkit for
detection. We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the components of
OSCAR and compare its performance to state-of-the-art model-driven and
data-driven methods on the SIRST-V2 benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a
top-down cascade refinement framework can improve the accuracy of infrared
small target detection without sacrificing efficiency. The DeepInfrared
toolkit, dataset, and trained models are available at

mechanical robustness to launch vibrations. All these features make SiPMs ideal
for use on space based experiments where the detectors require to be compact,
lightweight and capable of surviving launch conditions. A downside with the use
of this novel type of detector in space conditions is its susceptibility to
radiation damage. In order to understand the lifetime of SiPMs in space, both
the damage sustained due to radiation as well as the subsequent recovery, or
annealing, from this damage have to be studied. Here we present these studies
for three different types of SiPMs from the Hamamatsu S13360 series. Both their
behaviour after sustaining radiation equivalent to 2 years in low earth orbit
in a typical mission is presented, as well as the recovery of these detectors
while stored in different conditions. The storage conditions varied in
temperature as well as in operating voltage. The study found that the annealing
depends significantly on the temperature of the detectors with those stored at
high temperatures recovering significantly faster and at recovering closer to
the original performance. Additionally, no significant effect from a reasonable
bias voltage on the annealing was observed. Finally the annealing rate as a
function of temperature is presented along with various operating strategies
for the future SiPM based astrophysical detector POLAR-2 as well as for future

The proper calculation of the DM capture rate is key to derive bounds on DM
interactions in any scenario involving DM accretion in a star. We improve
former calculations, which rely on approximations, for both white dwarfs (WDs)
and neutron stars (NSs). We account for the stellar structure, gravitational
focusing, relativistic kinematics, Pauli blocking, realistic form factors, and
strong interactions (NSs). Considering DM capture by scattering off either ions
or degenerate electrons in WDs, we show that old WDs in DM-rich environments
could probe the elusive sub-GeV mass regime for both DM-nucleon and DM-electron
scattering. In NSs, DM can be captured via collisions with strongly interacting
baryons or relativistic leptons. We project the NS sensitivity to DM-nucleon

consists of time, coil index, and frequency domain location to each sampled
k-space point. We then learn the subject-specific mapping from these unique

frequency domain regularization. During inference, we obtain a complete k-space

inverse Fourier transform recovers the image, eliminating the need for density

coordinate their activity and solve complex tasks as a swarm, e.g. foraging for
food. This behaviour was shaped through evolutionary processes. In
computational models, self-coordination in swarms has been implemented using
probabilistic or action rules to shape the decision of each agent and the
collective behaviour. However, manual tuned decision rules may limit the
behaviour of the swarm. In this work we investigate the emergence of
self-coordination and communication in evolved swarms without defining any
rule. We evolve a swarm of agents representing an ant colony. We use a genetic
algorithm to optimize a spiking neural network (SNN) which serves as an
artificial brain to control the behaviour of each agent. The goal of the colony
is to find optimal ways to forage for food in the shortest amount of time. In
the evolutionary phase, the ants are able to learn to collaborate by depositing
pheromone near food piles and near the nest to guide its cohorts. The pheromone
usage is not encoded into the network; instead, this behaviour is established
through the optimization procedure. We observe that pheromone-based
communication enables the ants to perform better in comparison to colonies
where communication did not emerge. We assess the foraging performance by
comparing the SNN based model to a rule based system. Our results show that the
SNN based model can complete the foraging task more efficiently in a shorter
time. Our approach illustrates that even in the absence of pre-defined rules,
self coordination via pheromone emerges as a result of the network
optimization. This work serves as a proof of concept for the possibility of
creating complex applications utilizing SNNs as underlying architectures for
multi-agent interactions where communication and self-coordination is desired.

quality that can be used as a proxy to human evaluation. To evaluate our
approach, we construct training and evaluation sets from more than 40k human

achieved by training with supervision from human rating scores. We show that
when evaluated at the sentence level, BLASER correlates significantly better
with human judgment compared to ASR-dependent metrics including ASR-SENTBLEU in

combining speech and text as inputs to BLASER does not increase the correlation

  model",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Ohta-Kawasaki model for diblock copolymers exhibits a rich equilibrium
bifurcation structure. Even on one-dimensional base domains the bifurcation set
is characterized by high levels of multi-stability and numerous secondary
bifurcation points. Many of these bifurcations are of pitchfork type. In
previous work, the authors showed that if pitchfork bifurcations are induced by
a simple $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking, then computer-assisted proof
techniques can be used to rigorously validate them using extended systems.
However, many diblock copolymer pitchfork bifurcations cannot be treated in
this way. In the present paper, we show that in these more involved cases, a
cyclic group action is responsible for their existence, based on cyclic groups
of even order. We present theoretical results establishing such bifurcation
points and show that they can be characterized as nondegenerate solutions of a
suitable extended nonlinear system. Using the latter characterization, we also
demonstrate that computer-assisted proof techniques can be used to validate
such bifurcations. While the methods proposed in this paper are only applied to
the diblock copolymer model, we expect that they will also apply to other
parabolic partial differential equations.

potentially high dynamics, e.g., mobile edge networks, the efficiency of FL is
an important problem. Existing works have separately considered different
configurations to make FL more efficient, such as infrequent transmission of
model updates, client subsampling, and compression of update vectors. However,
an important open problem is how to jointly apply and tune these control knobs
in a single FL algorithm, to achieve the best performance by allowing a high
degree of freedom in control decisions. In this paper, we address this problem
and propose FlexFL - an FL algorithm with multiple options that can be adjusted
flexibly. Our FlexFL algorithm allows both arbitrary rates of local computation
at clients and arbitrary amounts of communication between clients and the
server, making both the computation and communication resource consumption
adjustable. We prove a convergence upper bound of this algorithm. Based on this
result, we further propose a stochastic optimization formulation and algorithm
to determine the control decisions that (approximately) minimize the
convergence bound, while conforming to constraints related to resource
consumption. The advantage of our approach is also verified using experiments.

  complex material response","24 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Model-free data-driven computational mechanics (DDCM) is a new paradigm for
simulations in solid mechanics. The modeling step associated to the definition
of a material constitutive law is circumvented through the introduction of an
abstract phase space in which, following a pre-defined rule,
physically-admissible states are matched to observed material response data
(coming from either experiments or lower-scale simulations). In terms of
computational resources, the search procedure that performs these matches is
the most onerous step in the algorithm. One of the main advantages of DDCM is
the fact that it avoids regression-based, bias-prone constitutive modeling.
However, many materials do display a simple linear response in the small-strain
regime while also presenting complex behavior after a certain deformation
threshold. Motivated by this fact, we present a novel refinement technique that
turns regular elements (equipped with a linear-elastic constitutive law) into
data-driven ones if they are expected to surpass the threshold known to trigger
material non-linear response. We term this technique ``data refinement'',
``d-refinement'' for short. Starting from an initially regular FEM mesh, the
proposed algorithm detects where the refinement is needed and iterates until
all elements presumed to display non-linearity become data-driven ones.
Insertion criteria are discussed. The scheme is well-suited for simulations
that feature non-linear response in relatively small portions of the domain
while the rest remains linear-elastic. The method is validated against a
traditional incremental solver (i.e., Newton-Raphson method) and we show that
the d-refinement framework can outperform it in terms of speed at no loss of
accuracy. We provide an application that showcases the advantage of the new
method: bridging scales in architected metamaterials.

Here, we focus on the case of supervised deep learning models for the

models, specifically Wasserstein GANs (wGANs), to generate data for different
classes of radio galaxies. Further, we study the impact of augmenting the
training data with images from our wGAN on three different classification
architectures. We find that this technique makes it possible to improve models

into the training set, with a considerable improvement of its classification
accuracy. In addition, we find it is more difficult to improve complex

characteristic $p$, $G=\boldsymbol{G}^{\sigma}$ its fixed-point subgroup under
the action of a Steinberg endomorphism $\sigma$, and $\overline{G}$ an almost
simple group with socle $G$. A maximal subgroup $M<\overline{G}$ is called
non-generic if it is almost simple and its socle is not isomorphic to a group
of Lie type in characteristic $p$. A finite subgroup $H$ of $\boldsymbol{G}$ is
Lie primitive if it does not lie in any proper closed positive-dimensional
subgroup of $\boldsymbol{G}$; it is Lie imprimitive if it lies in a
positive-dimensional subgroup $\boldsymbol{X}$ of $\boldsymbol{G}$; it is
strongly imprimitive if $\boldsymbol{X}$ can be chosen to be stable under the
action of $N_{\mathrm{Aut}\boldsymbol{G}}(H)$, where
$\mathrm{Aut}\boldsymbol{G}$ is the group generated by inner, diagonal, graph,

  We study the possible embeddings of a non-generic primitive simple group $H$

$H$ in $G$ over a suitable finite field $k$, and use them to deduce the number
of conjugacy classes of $H$ in $G$ and $\boldsymbol{G}$, and whether
$N_{\overline{G}}(H)$ is a maximal subgroup of $\overline{G}$. We also study
the case of $H\simeq\mathrm{Alt}_6\simeq\mathrm{PSL}_2(9)$ when
$\boldsymbol{G}$ is one of $\boldsymbol{F}_4$ and $\boldsymbol{E}_6$ in

only video-level labels are available for training. In previous studies, the
discriminative power of the learned features is not strong enough, and the data
imbalance resulting from the mini-batch training strategy is ignored. To
address these two issues, we propose a novel WSVAD method based on cross-batch
clustering guidance. To enhance the discriminative power of features, we
propose a batch clustering based loss to encourage a clustering branch to
generate distinct normal and abnormal clusters based on a batch of data.
Meanwhile, we design a cross-batch learning strategy by introducing clustering
results from previous mini-batches to reduce the impact of data imbalance. In
addition, we propose to generate more accurate segment-level anomaly scores
based on batch clustering guidance further improving the performance of WSVAD.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

high-resolution spectroscopy with calibrated optical frequency is demonstrated
by bridging the fields of speckle patterns and electro-optic frequency comb

WGM barcodes) is proposed to link the frequency of a tunable continuous-wave
(CW) laser to an optical reference provided by an ultra-stable laser. The
ultra-fine comb lines generated from the CW laser sample the spectrum with
sub-femtometer resolution. Measurement bandwidth is far extended by performing
sequential acquisitions, since the centre optical frequency of EOFC is
absolutely determined by WGM speckle-based wavemter. This approach fully
utilizes the advantages of two fields to realize 0.8-fm resolution with a fiber
laser and 80-nm bandwidth with an external cavity diode laser. The
spectroscopic measurements of an ultrahigh-Q cavity and the HCN gas absorption
is demonstrated, which shows the potentials of this compact system with high

unclear future because of conflicting modelling results and the lack of
long-term policy. This paper identifies three challenges and potential
opportunities by reviewing bioenergy historical national deployment, current
policy support, and possible future roles in Europe. The first challenge is on
the supply side. Analysing the supply-consumption dynamics and import
dependency of EU bioenergy, we find that the security of bioenergy supply is
challenging for liquid biofuels and those countries with the highest per-capita
bioenergy consumption in Europe. Second, the definition of sustainable
bioenergy in modelling studies is sometimes inconsistent with how EU policies
label it. Third, on the demand side, there are unique but competing uses for
bioenergy without a clear long-term strategy in Europe. We conclude with three
opportunities to tackle these challenges for future research. First, utilising
the untapped bioenergy potential with low environmental impacts could improve
supply security. A clear and harmonised definition of sustainable bioenergy
could better convey modelling results to policymaking. Finally, understanding
where best to use limited sustainable bioenergy supply through sector-coupled
energy system models can provide direction for a clearer EU bioenergy strategy
towards 2050.

the majority of their ``missing baryons''. Until now, most semi-analytic models
of galaxy formation have paid little attention to hot gaseous haloes and their
X-ray emission. In this paper, we adopt the one-dimensional model from Sharma
et al. instead of the isothermal sphere to describe the radial distribution of
hot gas in the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model. The hot gas halo can be divided
into two parts according to the ratio of the local thermal instability
time-scale and the free-fall time-scale: a cool core with $t_{\rm TI}/t_{\rm
ff}=10$ and a stable outer halo with $t_{\rm TI}/t_{\rm ff}>10$. We update the
prescriptions of cooling, feedback and stripping based on the new hot gas
profiles, and then reproduce several X-ray observational results, like the
radial profiles of hot gas density, and the scaling relations of X-ray
luminosity and temperature. We find: (1) Consistent with observations, flatter
density profiles in halo centers produce lower X-ray emission than an
isothermal sphere; (2) Cool core regions prone to precipitation have higher gas
temperature than the virial temperature, and a larger $T_{\rm X}/T_{\rm 200}$
ratio in smaller haloes leads to a steeper slope in the $L_{\rm X}-T_{\rm X}$
relation; (3) The ionized gas in the unbounded reservoir and low temperature
intergalactic gas in low mass haloes could be the main components of the halo
``missing baryons''. Our model outputs can predict the observations of hot gas
in the nearby universe and produce mock surveys of baryons probed by future
X-ray telescopes.

distributions, which give a statistical measurement for the temperature of the
disk as indicated by the mean radial action of the star sample. Estimations of
the scale heights in different radial action ranges for these pseudo-isothermal
distributions of the disks seem to show fixed relationships between radial
action $J_R$ and scale height $h$. We describe these relationships with a
two-parameter function of $h = \sqrt{J_R /a} + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are free
parameters. When testing with a three-parameter function of
$h=\sqrt[\alpha]{J_R/a}+b$, we find that this two-parameter function describes
the thin disk well, but we note the function should be used with care for the
thick disk. When comparing the best-fit relationships between the inner and
outer disk for both of the thin and thick disks, we find that the relationships
are nearly the same for the thin disks but are different for the thick disks.
The inner thick disk shows a nearly flattened relationship, while the outer
thick disk presents a gradually increasing relationship. This work highlights
an alternative way to unveil the heating history of the disks by investigating
the relationship between scale height and radial action, as these relationships

temperature, ski surface chemistry and roughness, dry friction with the snow
crystals and liquid meltwater film flow properties. Although a great amount of
resources are being spent on understanding glide and friction, a basic physical
understanding of the phenomena at play is still at large and the methodology
used for assessing the gliding quality of different full scale configurations
is still coarse in real world applications, which limits novel development of
robust methods to control and optimize glide. Such understanding and full scale
testing is particularly important for designing new ski gliders. In the present
work, we develop a novel experimental setup and use it to investigate through
field experiments the basic mechanical phenomena that influence glide and
friction of full scale skis on snow. The field setup features a mobile, novel
linear tribometer allowing investigation with whole skis in realistic
cross-country conditions (speed and load). The coefficient of friction between
the skis and snow is obtained from a load cell, which reports the force
necessary to pull a ski sled along a flat track. Simultaneously, thermistors
measure the temperature at the ski-snow interface. In addition, a GPS measures
displacement and velocity. The results obtained are in good agreement with
several measurements reported from similar experiments, and provide a
real-world validation of results obtained in the laboratory. In addition, we
release the general tribometer setup as open source material in order to
provide a foundation on which other research teams as well as cross-country

part of computer animations and games, as human motions are both diverse in
content and rich in styles. While the latest deep learning approaches have made
significant advancements in this domain, they mostly consider motion synthesis
and style manipulation as two separate problems. This is mainly due to the
challenge of learning both motion contents that account for the inter-class
behaviour and styles that account for the intra-class behaviour effectively in
a common representation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a denoising
diffusion probabilistic model solution for styled motion synthesis. As
diffusion models have a high capacity brought by the injection of
stochasticity, we can represent both inter-class motion content and intra-class
style behaviour in the same latent. This results in an integrated, end-to-end
trained pipeline that facilitates the generation of optimal motion and
exploration of content-style coupled latent space. To achieve high-quality
results, we design a multi-task architecture of diffusion model that
strategically generates aspects of human motions for local guidance. We also
design adversarial and physical regulations for global guidance. We demonstrate
superior performance with quantitative and qualitative results and validate the
effectiveness of our multi-task architecture.

the morphology of the prominence threaded structure, the area, the mass the

the balance between condensation and draining, affecting the general prominence

the next 20 years become a central part to our society. However, especially in
the early stages of deployment, there is expected to be incidents involving
AVs. In the event of AV incidents, decisions will need to be made that require
ethical decisions, e.g., deciding between colliding into a group of pedestrians
or a rigid barrier. For an AV to undertake such ethical decision making and
path planning, simulation models of the situation will be required that are
used in real-time on-board the AV. These models will enable path planning and
ethical decision making to be undertaken based on predetermined collision
injury severity levels. In this research, models are developed for the path
planning and ethical decision making that predetermine knowledge regarding the
possible collision injury severities, i.e., peak deformation of the AV
colliding into the rigid barrier or the impact velocity of the AV colliding
into a pedestrian. Based on such knowledge and using fuzzy logic, a novel
nonlinear weighted utility cost function for the collision injury severity
levels is developed. This allows the model-based predicted collision outcomes
arising from AV peak deformation and AV-pedestrian impact velocity to be
examined separately via weighted utility cost functions with a common
structure. The general form of the weighted utility cost function exploits a
fuzzy sets approach, thus allowing common utility costs from the two separate
utility cost functions to be meaningfully compared. A decision-making
algorithm, which makes use of a utilitarian ethical approach, ensures that the
AV will always steer onto the path which represents the lowest injury severity
level, hence utility cost to society.

choice of aggregation function. While summing over a node's neighbours can
approximate any permutation-invariant function over discrete inputs,
Cohen-Karlik et al. [2020] proved there are set-aggregation problems for which
summing cannot generalise to unbounded inputs, proposing recurrent neural
networks regularised towards permutation-invariance as a more expressive
aggregator. We show that these results carry over to the graph domain: GNNs
equipped with recurrent aggregators are competitive with state-of-the-art
permutation-invariant aggregators, on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world
problems. However, despite the benefits of recurrent aggregators, their $O(V)$
depth makes them both difficult to parallelise and harder to train on large
graphs. Inspired by the observation that a well-behaved aggregator for a GNN is
a commutative monoid over its latent space, we propose a framework for
constructing learnable, commutative, associative binary operators. And with
this, we construct an aggregator of $O(\log V)$ depth, yielding exponential

on a variety of speech tasks. Due to the quadratic time and space complexity of
self-attention, they usually operate at the level of relatively short (e.g.,
utterance) segments. In this paper, we study the use of context, i.e.,
surrounding segments, during fine-tuning and propose a new approach called
context-aware fine-tuning. We attach a context module on top of the last layer
of a pre-trained model to encode the whole segment into a context embedding
vector which is then used as an additional feature for the final prediction.
During the fine-tuning stage, we introduce an auxiliary loss that encourages
this context embedding vector to be similar to context vectors of surrounding
segments. This allows the model to make predictions without access to these
surrounding segments at inference time and requires only a tiny overhead
compared to standard fine-tuned models. We evaluate the proposed approach using
the SLUE and Libri-light benchmarks for several downstream tasks: Automatic
speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment
analysis (SA). The results show that context-aware fine-tuning not only
outperforms a standard fine-tuning baseline but also rivals a strong context
injection baseline that uses neighboring speech segments during inference.

formalized tools for dealing with the imprecision intrinsic to many problems. A
group is said to be nilpotent if it has a normal series of a finite length n.
By this notion, every finite p-group is nilpotent. Nilpotent structures such as
the p-groups, have normal series of finite length. Any finite p-group has many
normal subgroups and consequently, the phenomenon of large number of
non-isomorphic subgroups of a given order. This makes it an ideal object for

translations, numeric vectors, and syntax trees. We identify the difficulty of
interpretability and the complexity of choosing a distance function as key
obstacles in applying Krippendorff's alpha generally across these tasks. We
propose two novel, more interpretable measures, showing they yield more
consistent IAA measures across tasks and annotation distance functions.

  Supervised Semantic Segmentation","13 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is a
challenging task. Mainstream approaches follow a multi-stage framework and
suffer from high training costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training models (CLIP) to localize different
categories with only image-level labels and without further training. To
efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks from CLIP, we propose a
novel WSSS framework called CLIP-ES. Our framework improves all three stages of
WSSS with special designs for CLIP: 1) We introduce the softmax function into
GradCAM and exploit the zero-shot ability of CLIP to suppress the confusion
caused by non-target classes and backgrounds. Meanwhile, to take full advantage
of CLIP, we re-explore text inputs under the WSSS setting and customize two
text-driven strategies: sharpness-based prompt selection and synonym fusion. 2)
To simplify the stage of CAM refinement, we propose a real-time class-aware
attention-based affinity (CAA) module based on the inherent multi-head
self-attention (MHSA) in CLIP-ViTs. 3) When training the final segmentation
model with the masks generated by CLIP, we introduced a confidence-guided loss
(CGL) focus on confident regions. Our CLIP-ES achieves SOTA performance on
Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 while only taking 10% time of previous methods
for the pseudo mask generation. Code is available at

to strongly enforce both spatial translation and rotation invariance of the

deep learning approaches only focus on enhancing prediction accuracy, but
neglecting the discrimination imbalance of responses. That is, a considerable

Here, we propose a meta-learning model, A-VBANet, that can deliver
domain-agnostic surgical skill classification via one-shot learning. We develop
the A-VBANet on five laparoscopic and robotic surgical simulators.
Additionally, we test it on operating room (OR) videos of laparoscopic

The corpus consists of videos including audio and subtitles that have been
annotated by experts. Furthermore, we present a method for detecting metaphors
in the new dataset based on the textual content of the videos. The method
achieves a high F1-score (62\%) for metaphorical labels. We also experiment
with other modalities and multimodal methods; however, these methods did not
out-perform the text-based model. In our error analysis, we do identify that
there are cases where video could help in disambiguating metaphors, however,
the visual cues are too subtle for our model to capture. The data is available
on Zenodo.

  system models",,,,,"physics.ao-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The accurate representation of precipitation in Earth system models (ESMs) is
crucial for reliable projections of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts in
response to anthropogenic global warming. The complex cross-scale interactions
of processes that produce precipitation are challenging to model, however,
inducing potentially strong biases in ESM fields, especially regarding
extremes. State-of-the-art bias correction methods only address errors in the
simulated frequency distributions locally, at every individual grid cell.
Improving unrealistic spatial patterns of the ESM output, which would require
spatial context, has not been possible so far. Here, we show that a
post-processing method based on physically constrained generative adversarial
networks (GANs) can correct biases of a state-of-the-art, CMIP6-class ESM both
in local frequency distributions and in the spatial patterns at once. While our
method improves local frequency distributions equally well as gold-standard
bias-adjustment frameworks it strongly outperforms any existing methods in the
correction of spatial patterns, especially in terms of the characteristic
spatial intermittency of precipitation extremes.

  main intended applications are in probability theory but the paper itself is
  about metrics and topologies on spaces of functions",,,,"math.GN math.MG math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We introduce the path space over a general metrisable space. Elements of this
space are paths, which are pairs consisting of a closed subset of the real line
and a cadlag function that is defined on that subset and takes values in the
metrisable space. We equip the space of all paths with topologies that
generalise Skorohod's J1 and M1 topologies, prove that these topologies are
Polish, and derive compactness criteria.
  The central idea is that the closed graph (in case of the J1 topology) and
the filled-in graph (in case of the M1 topology) of a path can naturally be
viewed as totally ordered compact sets. We define a variant of the Hausdorff
metric that measures the distance between two compact sets, each of which is
equipped with a total order. We show that the topology generated by this metric
is Polish and derive a compactness criterion. Specialising to closed or
filled-in graphs then yields Skorohod's J1 and M1 topologies, generalised to
functions that need not all be defined on the same domain.

  and encryption",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image classification often relies on a high-quality machine vision system
with a large view field and high resolution, demanding fine imaging optics,
heavy computational costs, and large communication bandwidths between an image
sensor and a computing unit. Here, we report a novel image-free sensing
framework for resource efficient image classification where the required number
of measurements can be reduced by up to two orders of magnitude. In the
proposed framework of single-pixel detection, the optical field from a target
is first scattered by an optical diffuser and then two-dimensionally modulated
by a spatial light modulator. The optical diffuser simultaneously serves as a
compressor and an encryptor for the target information, effectively narrowing
the view field and improving the system's security. The one-dimensional
sequence of intensity values, measured with time-varying patterns on the
spatial light modulator, is then used to extract semantic information based on
end-to-end deep learning. The proposed sensing framework is shown to provide
over 95 percentage accuracy with the sampling rate of 1 percentage and 5
percentage, respectively, for the classification of MNIST dataset and the
recognition of Chinese license plate, which was up to 24 percentage more
efficient compared with the case without an optical diffuser. The proposed
framework represents a significant breakthrough in realizing high-throughput
machine intelligence for scene analysis, with low-bandwidth, low cost, and
strong encryption.

several variables based on their importance to the overall objective. However,
using MPO methods in therapeutic discovery is challenging due to the number of
cheminformatics properties required to find an optimal solution. High
throughput virtual screening to identify hit candidates produces a large amount
of data with conflicting properties. For instance, toxicity and binding
affinity can contradict each other and cause improbable levels of toxicity that
can lead to adverse effects. Instead of using the exhaustive method of treating
each property, multiple properties can be combined into a single MPO score,
with weights assigned for each property. This desirability score also lends
itself well to ML applications that can use the score in the loss function. In
this work, we will discuss scaffold focused graph-based Markov chain monte
carlo framework built to generate molecules with optimal properties. This
framework trains itself on-the-fly with the MPO score of each iteration of
molecules, and is able to work on a greater number of properties and sample the
chemical space around a starting scaffold. Results are compared to the chemical
Transformer model molGCT to judge performance between graph and natural
language processing approaches.

boundary conditions are essential to find the optimal acoustic conditions in
building design. We propose to use the reduced basis method (RBM) for realistic
room acoustic scenarios where the surfaces have inhomogeneous acoustic
properties, which enables quick evaluations of changing absorption materials
for different surfaces in room acoustic simulations. The RBM has shown its
benefit to speed up room acoustic simulations by three orders of magnitude for
uniform boundary conditions. This study investigates the RBM with two main
focuses, 1) various source positions in diverse geometries, e.g., square,
rectangular, L-shaped, and disproportionate room. 2) Inhomogeneous surface
absorption in 2D and 3D by parameterizing numerous acoustic parameters of
surfaces, e.g., the thickness of a porous material, cavity depth, switching
between a frequency independent (e.g., hard surface) and frequency dependent
boundary condition. Results of numerical experiments show speedups of more than
two orders of magnitude compared to a high fidelity numerical solver in a 3D
case where reverberation time varies within one just noticeable difference in
all the frequency octave bands.
