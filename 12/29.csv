eigenstates is currently far from being complete. It is particularly important
to establish tools for their characterization in time domain. Here we argue
that a scaled survival probability, where time is measured in units of a
typical Heisenberg time, exhibits a power-law decay that appears to be
independent of system size at eigenstate transitions. We first demonstrate this
property in two paradigmatic quadratic models, the one-dimensional Aubry-Andre
model and three-dimensional Anderson model. Surprisingly, we then show that
similar phenomenology emerges in the interacting avalanche model of ergodicity
breaking phase transitions. This establishes an intriguing similarity between
localization transition in quadratic systems and ergodicity breaking phase
transition in interacting systems.

radiative exchange of photons between cells has to be taken into account to
properly model these devices. In this work it is shown how this radiative
coupling can be accounted for in series connected multi-junction solar cells by
constants called transfer coefficients. Under the assumption that the exchanged
radiation only travels one way, from higher to lower band gaps, the transfer
coefficients allows the relation between the voltage and current of the device
to be expressed by a convenient mathematical expression. Another advantage of
this model is that it allows the short circuit current of radiatively coupled
multijunction cells to be calculated in a straightforward way. Non-ideality may
be included by means of the external radiative efficiency. A number of examples
are discussed to show how the transfer coefficients describes the radiative

radiatively coupled multi-junction cells when illuminated by the AM1.5

coverage, beyond fifth-generation networks will be dense. Thus, instead of
wired backhaul, wireless backhaul will be cost-effective and flexible. For
security in multi-transmitter systems, sub-optimal and optimal transmitter
selection schemes exist. However, including backhaul activity knowledge
available (BKA) and backhaul activity knowledge unavailable (BKU) cases and
transmitter selection schemes, there is no generalized secrecy analysis method.
Moreover, evaluation of the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) of the optimal selection
schemes is impossible using existing solution approaches. To address these, we
propose two sub-optimal and optimal transmitter selection schemes for a
small-cell multi-transmitter system in BKU or BKA cases in the presence of
multiple colluding eavesdroppers. We derive the distribution of the ratio of
the destination channel SNR and eavesdropping channel SNR, thereby providing
different secrecy performance metrics uniformly irrespective of selection
schemes and BKU or BKA cases. Simplified asymptotic expressions are provided to
elucidate the influence of the system parameters and of the backhaul
reliability. We observe that the secrecy performance improves when the
knowledge of backhaul link activity is utilized, and the improvement is most
noticeable when the backhaul is highly unreliable. We also observe that while
the secrecy performance degrades with an increasing number of eavesdroppers,
neither the asymptotic saturation value of the secrecy outage probability nor
the rate of improvement of the ESR with signal-to-noise-ratio depends on the
number of eavesdroppers.

preferred way of expressing language subsets. Some guidelines are formulated in
terms of the programming language and its implementation only: in this case
they are amenable to automatic checking. However, due to fundamental
limitations of computing, some guidelines are undecidable, that is, they are
based on program properties that no current and future algorithm can capture in
all cases. The most mature and widespread coding standards, the MISRA ones,
explicitly tag guidelines with undecidable or decidable. It turns out that this

undecidability is a common source of confusion affecting many users of coding

analysis. We construct evolving climate networks of mean sea level pressure
fluctuations and analyze anomalies of local clustering coefficient in these

association between spatially inhomogeneous georeferenced multivariate time

into a relevance tower with regular input features, and a bias tower with
bias-relevant inputs such as the position of a document. A successful
factorization will allow the relevance tower to be exempt from biases. In this
work, we identify a critical issue that existing ULTR methods ignored - the
bias tower can be confounded with the relevance tower via the underlying true
relevance. In particular, the positions were determined by the logging policy,
i.e., the previous production model, which would possess relevance information.
We give both theoretical analysis and empirical results to show the negative

different transformations on the available data instances to generate new
correct and representative data instances. DA increases the dataset size and
its variability, which enhances the model performance and its prediction
accuracy. DA also solves the class imbalance problem in the classification

there are situations involving components of conserved currents, or derivative

first undertake a careful analysis of the linearized wave equations in AdS
black hole backgrounds and identify the ramification points of the solutions as
a function of (complexified) frequency and momentum. All the equations we study
are Fuchsian with only regular singular points that for the most part are
associated with the geometric features of the background. Special features,
e.g., the appearance of apparent singular points at the horizon, whence
outgoing solutions end up being analytic, arise at higher codimension loci in
parameter space. Using the grSK geometry, we demonstrate that these apparent
singularities do not correspond to any interesting physical features in
higher-point functions. We also argue that the Schwinger-Keldysh collapse and
KMS conditions, implemented by the grSK geometry, continue to hold even in the
presence of such singularities. For charged black holes above a critical
charge, the energy density operator does not possess an exponentially growing
mode, associated with `pole-skipping' (from one such apparent singularity). Our
analysis suggests that the connection between the scrambling physics of black
holes and energy transport has, at best, a limited domain of validity.

Campaign (HAC) depicting the multistage activities that led up to the critical
event. We define the concept of ""Alert Episode Heat"" to represent the analysts
opinion of how much an event contributes to the attack campaign of the critical
IoC given their knowledge of the network and security expertise. Leveraging a
network-agnostic feature set, HeAT learns the essence of analyst's assessment

galaxies is imprinted on the rotation curves of galaxies. Here we show that
this same scale is imprinted on recombination era anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background. We revisit an analysis due to Mannheim and Horne, to show
that in the conformal gravity theory the length scale of metric signals that
originate in the primordial nucleosynthesis era at $10^{9\circ}$K can fill out
the entire recombination era sky. Similarly, the length scale of acoustic
signals that originate at $10^{13\circ}$K can also fill out the entire
recombination era sky. We show that the amplitudes of metric fluctuations that
originate in the nucleosynthesis era can grow by a factor of $10^{12}$ at
recombination, and by a factor of $10^{18}$ at the current time. In addition we
find that without any period of exponential expansion a length scale as small
as $10^{-33}$ cm can grow to the size of the recombination sky if it begins to
grow at a temperature of order $10^{33}$ degrees.

methods for segmenting regions of interest. Their identification is one of the
most complex steps, and therefore of great interest for the study of robust
methods that do not necessarily rely on a machine learning (ML) approach.
Method: A fully automatic and optimized segmentation process for different
datasets is a prerequisite for classifying and diagnosing Indirect
ImmunoFluorescence (IIF) raw data. This study describes a deterministic
computational neuroscience approach for identifying cells and nuclei. It is far
from the conventional neural network approach, but it is equivalent to their
quantitative and qualitative performance, and it is also solid to adversative
noise. The method is robust, based on formally correct functions, and does not
suffer from tuning on specific data sets. Results: This work demonstrates the
robustness of the method against the variability of parameters, such as image
size, mode, and signal-to-noise ratio. We validated the method on two datasets
(Neuroblastoma and NucleusSegData) using images annotated by independent
medical doctors. Conclusions: The definition of deterministic and formally
correct methods, from a functional to a structural point of view, guarantees
the achievement of optimized and functionally correct results. The excellent
performance of our deterministic method (NeuronalAlg) to segment cells and
nuclei from fluorescence images was measured with quantitative indicators and
compared with those achieved by three published ML approaches.

of star clusters into individual $10\:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ star particles. In
the rest-frame UV, the galaxy has an irregular morphology with no bulge or
galactic disk, dominated by light emitted from numerous, compact, and
gravitationally-bound star clusters. This is especially interesting in light of
recent HST and JWST observations that -- aided by the magnifying power of
gravitational lenses -- have imaged, at parsec-scale resolution, individual
young star clusters in the process of forming in similar galaxies at $z>6$.
Because of their low metallicities and high temperatures, star-forming gas
clouds in this galaxy have densities $\sim 100$ times higher than typical giant
molecular clouds; hence, their star formation efficiencies are high enough
($f_*\sim10-70$ per cent) to produce a sizeable population of potential
globular cluster progenitors but typically smaller (between a few $100\:-\:

metallicities ($10^{-3.5}-10^{-2.5}\:\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$). The initial mass
function of the star-forming clouds is log-normal while the bound star cluster
mass function is a power-law with a slope that depends mainly on $f_*$ but also
on the temporal proximity to a major starburst. We find slopes between $-0.5$
and $-2.5$ depending on the assumed sub-grid $f_*$. Star formation is
self-regulated on galactic scales; however, the multi-modal metallicity
distribution of the star clusters and the fraction of stars locked into
surviving bound star clusters depends on $f_*$.

the relative abundance of pro-eating disorder content, which reached its peak
in the summertime. These fluctuations correspond not only to the seasons, but
also to stressors, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, the Twitter image

downlink data transmission and a network deployment with a single central

noncoherent transmission when assuming unlimited fronthaul links, the former
requires a perfect timing synchronization, which is practically not viable over
a large network. Furthermore, relying on a single CPU for geographically large
cell-free networks is not scalable. Thus, to realize the expected gains of
cellfree systems in practice, alternative transmission strategies for realistic
multi-CPU cell-free systems are required. Therefore, this paper proposes a
novel downlink data transmission scheme that combines and generalizes the
existing coherent and non-coherent transmissions. The proposed transmission
scheme, named mixed transmission, works based on the realistic assumption that
only the access points (APs) controlled by a same CPU are synchronized, and
thus transmit in a coherent fashion, while APs from different CPUs require no
synchronism and transmit in a non-coherent manner. We also propose extensions
of existing clustering algorithms for multi-CPU cell-free systems with mixed
transmission. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed
clustering algorithms with mixed transmission have the potential to perform
close to the ideal coherent transmission.

an important role in transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. For
vaccine-preventable diseases, outstanding issues like vaccine hesitancy and
availability of vaccines further lead to nonuniform coverage among groups, not
to mention the efficacy of vaccines and the mixing pattern varying from one
group to another. As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic transitions to endemicity,
it is of interest and significance to understand the impact of aforementioned
population heterogeneity on the emergence and persistence of epidemics. Here we
analyze epidemic thresholds and characterize bifurcation dynamics by accounting
for heterogeneity caused by group-dependent characteristics, including
vaccination rate and efficacy as well as disease transmissibility. Our analysis
shows that increases in the difference in vaccination coverage among groups can
render multiple equilibria of disease burden to exist even if the overall basic
reproductive ratio is below one (also known as backward bifurcation). The
presence of other heterogeneity factors such as differences in vaccine
efficacy, transmission, mixing pattern, and group size can each exhibit subtle
impacts on bifurcation. We find that heterogeneity in vaccine efficacy can
undermine the condition for backward bifurcations whereas homophily tends to
aggravate disease endemicity. Our results have practical implications for
improving public health efforts by addressing the role of population
heterogeneity in the spread and control of diseases.

also shown to give rise to a tristable switching behavior, showcasing the

show that although the proportion of journeys by car decreases in larger

$\tau_{\rm c}$ is usually determined (half a mixing length above the base of
the convective zone) fails for fully convective stars and there is no agreement
on this in the literature. Our calculations were performed with the ATON
stellar evolution code. We concentrated our analysis on fully and partially
convective stars motivated by recent observations of slowly rotating fully
convective stars, whose X-ray emissions correlate with their Rossby numbers in
the same way as in solar-like stars, suggesting that the presence of a
tachocline is not required for magnetic field generation. We investigate the
behaviour of $\tau_{\rm c}$ over the stellar radius for stars of different

with the stellar radius, we use our theoretical results to determine a better
radial position at which to calculate it for fully convective stars. Using our

analyticity of a torus with given frequency through the computation of the
Lindstedt series expansions of the embedding of the torus and the drift term.
The Pad\'e approximants provide the shape of the analyticity domains by
plotting the poles of the polynomial at the denominator of the approximants.
Secondly, we implement a Newton method to construct the embedding of the torus;
the breakdown threshold is then estimated by looking at the blow-up of the
Sobolev norms of the embedding. Finally, we implement an extension of Greene
method to get information on the breakdown threshold of an invariant torus with
irrational frequency by looking at the stability of the periodic orbits with
periods approximating the frequency of the torus.
  We apply these methods to 2D and 4D standard maps. The 2D maps can either be
conservative (symplectic) or dissipative ( more precisely, conformally
symplectic, namely a dissipative map with the geometric property to transform
the symplectic form into a multiple of itself). The 4D maps are obtained
coupling $(i)$ two symplectic standard maps, or $(ii)$ two conformally
symplectic standard maps, or $(iii)$ a symplectic and a conformally symplectic
standard map.
  Concerning the results, Pad\'e and Newton methods perform well and provide
reliable and consistent results (although we implemented Newton method only for
symplectic and conformally symplectic maps). Our implementation of the
extension of Greene method is inconclusive, since it is computationally
expensive and delicate, especially in 4D non-symplectic maps, also due to the

of several conceptual and technical issues. Here, recent mathematical results
are used to provide a consistent algebraic formulation of dynamical symplectic
reduction that avoids difficult requirements such as the computation of a
complete set of Dirac observables or the construction of a physical Hilbert
space. In addition, the new algebraic treatment makes it possible to implement
a consistent realization of the gauge structure off the constraint surface. As
a consequence, previously unrecognized consistency conditions are imposed on
deparameterization -- the method traditionally used to unfreeze evolution in
completely constrained systems. A detailed discussion of how the new
formulation extends previous semiclassical results shows that an internal time
degree of freedom need not be semiclassical in order to define a consistent
quantum evolution.

  Fixed-Parameter Tractability",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we study the Induced Matching problem: Given an undirected
graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$, is there an induced matching $M$ of size at
least $\ell$? An edge subset $M$ is an induced matching in $G$ if $M$ is a
matching such that there is no edge between two distinct edges of $M$. Our work
looks into the parameterized complexity of Induced Matching with respect to
""below guarantee"" parameterizations. We consider the parameterization $u -
\ell$ for an upper bound $u$ on the size of any induced matching. For instance,
any induced matching is of size at most $n / 2$ where $n$ is the number of
vertices, which gives us a parameter $n / 2 - \ell$. In fact, there is a
straightforward $9^{n/2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for Induced
Matching [Moser and Thilikos, J. Discrete Algorithms]. Motivated by this, we
ask: Is Induced Matching FPT for a parameter smaller than $n / 2 - \ell$? In
search for such parameters, we consider $MM(G) - \ell$ and $IS(G) - \ell$,
where $MM(G)$ is the maximum matching size and $IS(G)$ is the maximum
independent set size of $G$. We find that Induced Matching is presumably not
FPT when parameterized by $MM(G) - \ell$ or $IS(G) - \ell$. In contrast to
these intractability results, we find that taking the average of the two helps
-- our main result is a branching algorithm that solves Induced Matching in
$49^{(MM(G) + IS(G))/ 2 - \ell} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Our algorithm makes use
of the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition to find a structure to branch on.

dynamic. Whilst efforts are on-going to run these on traditional HPC machines,
another option is to leverage the computing power donated by volunteers.
Volunteer computing, where members of the public donate some of their CPU time
to large scale projects has been popular for many years because it is a
powerful way of delivering compute for specific problems, with the public often
eager to contribute to a good cause with societal benefits. However,
traditional volunteer computing has required user installation of specialist
software which is a barrier to entry, and the development of the software
itself by the projects, even on-top of existing frameworks, is non-trivial.
  As such, the number of users donating CPU time to these volunteer computing
projects has decreased in recent years, and this comes at a time when the
frequency of disasters, often driven by climate change, are rising fast. We
believe that an alternative approach, where visitors to websites donate some of

plethora of novel ordered states and intriguing magnetic phases such as quantum

the Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice, a paradigmatic model
capturing the interplay between strong correlations and magnetic frustration.
However, the fate of frustrated magnetism in the presence of itinerant dopants
remains unclear, as well as its connection to the doped phases of the square
Hubbard model. Here, we probe the local spin order of a Hubbard model with
controllable frustration and doping, using ultracold fermions in anisotropic
optical lattices continuously tunable from a square to a triangular geometry.
At half-filling and strong interactions $U/t \sim 9$, we observe at the
single-site level how frustration reduces the range of magnetic correlations
and drives a transition from a collinear N\'eel antiferromagnet to a
short-range correlated 120$^{\circ}$ spiral phase. Away from half-filling,
magnetic correlations show a pronounced asymmetry between particle and hole
doping close to triangular geometries and hint at a transition to ferromagnetic
order at a particle doping above $20\%$. This work paves the way towards
exploring possible chiral ordered or superconducting phases in triangular
lattices, and realizing t-tprime square lattice Hubbard models that may be
essential to describe superconductivity in cuprate materials.

have begun to advise employers on which job applicants to interview, judges on
which defendants to grant bail, lenders on which homeowners to give loans, and
more. In such settings, different data-driven rules result in different
decisions. The problem is: to every data-driven rule, there are exceptions.
While a data-driven rule may be appropriate for some, it may not be appropriate
for all. As data-driven decisions become more common, there are cases in which
it becomes necessary to protect the individuals who, through no fault of their
own, are the data-driven exceptions. At the same time, it is impossible to
scrutinize every one of the increasing number of data-driven decisions, begging
the question: When and how should data-driven exceptions be protected?
  In this piece, we argue that individuals have the right to be an exception to
a data-driven rule. That is, the presumption should not be that a data-driven
rule--even one with high accuracy--is suitable for an arbitrary
decision-subject of interest. Rather, a decision-maker should apply the rule
only if they have exercised due care and due diligence (relative to the risk of
harm) in excluding the possibility that the decision-subject is an exception to
the data-driven rule. In some cases, the risk of harm may be so low that only
cursory consideration is required. Although applying due care and due diligence
is meaningful in human-driven decision contexts, it is unclear what it means
for a data-driven rule to do so. We propose that determining whether a
data-driven rule is suitable for a given decision-subject requires the
consideration of three factors: individualization, uncertainty, and harm. We
unpack this right in detail, providing a framework for assessing data-driven
rules and describing what it would mean to invoke the right in practice.

moduli space, multiplication is concatenation of strings of Riemann spheres and
comultiplication is forgetting marked points. In this way, the bimonoid
structure is an analog of the cyclic operad structure on the moduli space of
genus zero marked curves. Covariant/contravariant data on permutohedral space
is endowed with the structure of cocommutative/commutative bimonoids by
pushing-forward/pulling-back data along the (co)multiplication. Many well-known
combinatorial objects index data on permutohedral space. Moreover,
combinatorial objects often have the structure of bimonoids, with
multiplication/comultiplication given by merging/restricting objects in some
way. We prove that the bimonoid structure enjoyed by these indexing
combinatorial objects coincides with that induced by the bimonoid structure of
permutohedral space. Thus, permutohedral space may be viewed as a fundamental
underlying object which geometrically interprets many combinatorial Hopf
algebras. Aguiar-Mahajan have shown that classical combinatorial Hopf theory is
based on the braid hyperplane arrangement in a crucial way. This paper aims to
similarly establish permutohedral space as a central object, providing an even

amplitudes in the Schwinger parametrization, which become integrals over

overcome this challenge, over-the-air computing (AirComp) is a promising medium
access technology, which exploits the superposition property of the wireless
multiple access channel (MAC) and offers significant bandwidth savings. In this
work, we propose an AirComp framework for general distributed convex
optimization problems. Specifically, a distributed primaldual (DPD) subgradient
method is utilized for the optimization procedure. Under general assumptions,
we prove that DPDAirComp can asymptotically achieve zero expected constraint

problem, despite the presence of channel fading and additive noise. Moreover,
with proper power control of the users' signals, the expected non-zero
optimality gap can also be mitigated. Two practical applications of the
proposed framework are presented, namely, smart grid management and wireless
resource allocation. Finally, numerical results reconfirm DPDAirComp's
excellent performance, while it is also shown that DPD-AirComp converges an
order of magnitude faster compared to a digital orthogonal multiple access

involving hyperbolic PDEs. Like physics-informed neural networks (PINN), CINN
is a meshless machine learning solver with universal approximation
capabilities. Unlike PINN, which enforces a PDE softly via a multi-part loss
function, CINN encodes the characteristics of the PDE in a general-purpose deep
neural network by adding a characteristic layer. This neural network is trained
with the usual MSE data-fitting regression loss and does not require residual
losses on collocation points. This leads to faster training and can avoid
well-known pathologies of gradient descent optimization of multi-part PINN loss
functions. This paper focuses on linear transport phenomena, in which case it
is shown that, if the characteristic ODEs can be solved exactly, then the
output of a CINN is an exact solution of the PDE, even at initialization,
preventing the occurrence of non-physical solutions. In addition, a CINN can
also be trained with soft penalty constraints that enforce, for example,
periodic or Neumman boundary conditions, without losing the property that the
output satisfies the PDE automatically. We also propose an architecture that
extends the CINN approach to linear hyperbolic systems of PDEs. All CINN
architectures proposed here can be trained end-to-end from sample data using
standard deep learning software. Experiments with the simple advection
equation, a stiff periodic advection equation, and an acoustics problem where
data from one field is used to predict the other, unseen field, indicate that
CINN is able to improve on the accuracy of the baseline PINN, in some cases by
a considerable margin, while also being significantly faster to train and
avoiding non-physical solutions. An extension to nonlinear PDEs is also briefly
discussed.

propelling filament and passive Brownian particles. We consider a polymer whose
monomers experience a constant propulsion force perpendicular to the local
tangent in the presence of passive particles undergoing thermal fluctuations in
two dimensions. We demonstrate that the sideways propelling polymer can act as
a sweeper to collect the passive Brownian particles, mimicking a shuttle-cargo
system. The number of particles the polymer collects during its motion
increases with time and finally saturates to a maximum number. Moreover, the
velocity of the polymer decreases as the particles get trapped due to the extra
drag they generate. Rather than going to zero, the velocity eventually reaches
a terminal value close to the contribution from the thermal velocity when it
collects the maximum load. We show that, apart from the length of the polymer,
the propulsion strength and the number of passive particles are deciding
factors for the maximum trapped particles. In addition, we demonstrate that the
collected particles arrange themselves in a triangular, closed, packed state,

for planet formation. In particular, Kama et al. proposed that the deficit of
refractory elements in the surfaces of some Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) may be
linked to the presence of disk cavities likely caused by Jovian planets that
trap the metal-rich content. This work aims to provide a robust test on the
previous proposal by analyzing the largest sample of HAeBes with homogeneously
derived [M/H] values, stellar, and circumstellar properties. [M/H] values of 67
HAeBes were derived based on observed spectra and Kurucz synthetic models.
Statistical analyses were carried out aiming to test the potential relation
between [M/H] and the group I sources from the spectral energy distribution
(SED) classification by Meeus et al., associated to the presence of cavities
potentially carved by giant planets. Our study robustly confirms that group I
sources tend to have a lower [M/H] than that of group II HAeBes. A similar
analysis involving SED-based transitional disks does not reveal such a
relation, indicating that not all processes capable of creating dust holes have
an effect on the stellar abundances. We also show that the observed [M/H]
differences are not driven by environmental effects. Finally, group I sources
tend to have stronger (sub-) mm continuum emission presumably related to the
presence of giant planets. Indeed, literature results indicate that disk
substructures probably associated to their presence are up to ten times more
frequent in group I HAeBes. We provide indirect evidences suggesting that giant
planets are more frequent around group I/low [M/H] stars than around the rest
of the HAeBes. However, the direct test requires multiple detections of forming
planets in their disks, so far limited to the candidate around the metal
depleted ([M/H] = -0.35 +- 0.25) group I HAeBe star AB Aur.

origin of the hadron mass scale, chiral symmetry breaking and the pattern of
hadronic bound states. Some of these complex issues have been recently
addressed in an effective computational framework of hadron structure based on
a semiclassical approximation to light-front QCD, and its holographic embedding
in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. This framework also embodies an underlying
superconformal algebraic structure which gives rise to the emergence of a mass
scale within the superconformal group: It determines the effective confinement
potential of mesons, baryons and tetraquarks. The normalizable zero-mass ground
state is identified with the pion which has no baryonic supersymmetric partner,
a property which is shared for the lowest meson state in each particle family.

particular, we analyze diagonalization of Hamiltonian terms using a

unitaries in the digitized time-evolution operator can be implemented. The
lattice gauge theory studied is the SU(2) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions
coupled to one flavor of staggered fermions, for which a complete

The algorithms are shown to be applicable to higher-dimensional theories as
well as to other Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. The example chosen
further demonstrates the importance of adopting efficient theoretical
formulations: it is shown that an explicitly gauge-invariant formulation using
loop, string, and hadron degrees of freedom simplifies the algorithms and
lowers the cost compared with the standard formulations based on
angular-momentum as well as the Schwinger-boson degrees of freedom. The
loop-string-hadron formulation further retains the non-Abelian gauge symmetry
despite the inexactness of the digitized simulation, without the need for
costly controlled operations. Such theoretical and algorithmic considerations

  Grosse","On Implicit Bias in Overparameterized Bilevel Optimization","ICML 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems in machine learning involve bilevel optimization (BLO),
including hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and dataset distillation.
Bilevel problems consist of two nested sub-problems, called the outer and inner
problems, respectively. In practice, often at least one of these sub-problems
is overparameterized. In this case, there are many ways to choose among optima
that achieve equivalent objective values. Inspired by recent studies of the
implicit bias induced by optimization algorithms in single-level optimization,
we investigate the implicit bias of gradient-based algorithms for bilevel
optimization. We delineate two standard BLO methods -- cold-start and
warm-start -- and show that the converged solution or long-run behavior depends
to a large degree on these and other algorithmic choices, such as the
hypergradient approximation. We also show that the inner solutions obtained by
warm-start BLO can encode a surprising amount of information about the outer
objective, even when the outer parameters are low-dimensional. We believe that
implicit bias deserves as central a role in the study of bilevel optimization
as it has attained in the study of single-level neural net optimization.

for cosmological observations, because of the possible large correlations
generated between long and short distances. These signatures are captured by
the local shape of the scalar bispectrum. In this paper, we revisit the
nonlinearities of the conversion process from additional light scalars into
curvature perturbations during inflation. We provide analytic templates for
correlation functions valid at any kinematical configuration, using the
cosmological bootstrap as a main computational tool. Our results include the
possibility of large breaking of boost symmetry, in the form of small speeds of
sound for both the inflaton and the mediators. We consider correlators coming
from the tree-level exchange of a massless scalar field. By introducing a
late-time cutoff, we identify that the symmetry constraints on the correlators
are modified. This leads to anomalous conformal Ward identities, and
consequently the bootstrap differential equations acquire a source term that
depends on this cutoff. The solutions to the differential equations are scalar
seed functions that incorporate these late-time growth effects. Applying
weight-shifting operators to auxiliary ""seed"" functions, we obtain a systematic
classification of shapes of non-Gaussianity coming from massless exchange. For
theories with de Sitter symmetry, we compare the resulting shapes with the ones
obtained via the $\delta N$ formalism, identifying missing contributions away
from the squeezed limit. For boost-breaking scenarios, we derive a novel class
of shape functions with phenomenologically distinct features. Specifically, the
new shape provides a simple extension of equilateral non-Gaussianity: the
signal peaks at a geometric configuration controlled by the ratio of the sound
speeds of the mediator and the inflaton.

strong force has a nearly zero theta angle $\bar\theta_3 \simeq 0$ for the 4d
Standard Model (SM). The new ingredient is Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG):
symmetry-preserving mass or energy gap can be generated without breaking any
symmetry $G$ and without any quadratic mean-field mass deformation as long as
$G$ is all perturbative local and nonperturbative global anomaly-free. In our
first model, we propose a disordered non-mean-field SMG gap (instead of the
ordered Anderson-Higgs induced mass gap) for the $u$ quark (or generally a set
of quarks and leptons totally anomaly-free in $G$) generated by multi-fermion
interactions or by dynamical disordered mass fields, absorbing $\bar\theta_3$.
Another variant of this first model is the SMG gapping a hypothetical hidden
full fourth family of SM fermions. In our second model, we have a chiral SM and
mirror SM together to respect the Nielsen-Ninomiya fermion-doubling and a
parity-reflection $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm PR}$ symmetry at high energy, so the
$\bar\theta_3 = 0$. Then the SMG lifts only the mirror SM with a large energy
gap but leaves the chiral SM at lower energy, which not only ""spontaneously""
breaks the parity-reflection symmetry maximally but also relates our solution
to solve another nonperturbative chiral fermion regularization problem by
removing the fermion doubling. The predictive signature of both SMG-based
models is that some SM fermions or mirror fermions are highly interacting
(beyond the conventional SM Higgs or SM gauge interactions) mediated through
hypothetical direct multi-fermion or disordered mass-field interactions.

of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware
utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity
gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the
hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language
modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that
existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the
sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on
language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed
for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes
within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid
125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers
surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to
improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose
FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on
sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that
exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.
FlashConv yields 2$\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows
hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\times$ faster than Transformers.
Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B

perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and

While the case of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange has been extensively
studied, the actual materials exhibit a ferromagnetic nearest neighbor
exchange. Here we show that such a sign change of the dominant nearest neighbor
coupling has substantial consequences on the phase diagram. In particular, the
nature of the quantum disordered phase of interest changes from a plaquette
valence bond crystal to a long-range entangled spin liquid phase. By means of
complementary numerical simulations, based on exact diagonalization and the
pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group, we demonstrate the formation
of a gapless spin liquid state at the heart of the ferromagnetic phase diagram
in the isotropic Heisenberg limit, which gives way to out-of-plane Ising
magnetic order upon inclusion of XXZ anisotropy. The magnetically ordered
phases surrounding this quantum disordered region are much less sensitive to
the sign change of the dominant interaction and can be understood from their
classical analogs. We briefly comment on the relevance of our results for

context it is natural that external heat flux control on nanoscale devices
became an appealing strategy that has been explored in recent years. In this
work we study the thermal resonance phenomenon, i.e., the maximum heat flux
obtained by means of an external periodic driving, of a one-dimensional system
composed of two dissimilar Frenkel-Kontorva lattices with both nearest-neighbor
(NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions connected by time-modulated
NN and NNN couplings in contact with two heat reservoirs operating at different
temperature. We study the effect of the NNN interactions on the various heat
transport regimes afforded by the structural modifications that can be made on
the model. The dependence of the thermal resonance on the system size is
studied as well. Our results show that, despite the increased connectivity of
both sides afforded by the NNN interactions, the overlap of the phonon bands of
both parts of the system still determines the frequency range wherewith thermal
resonance emerges.

namely, the bump-like feature(s) that arise as a result of burst(s) of particle
production during inflation. The latest CMB observations by Planck 2018 can
accommodate such features. In the near future, observations of redshifted 21 cm
signal from the epoch of reionization can put additional constraints on
inflation models by exploiting the expected tomographic information across a
wide range of co-moving wave-numbers. In this work, we study the potential of
upcoming observational data from SKA-Low to constrain the parameters of the
primordial power spectrum with bump-like features. We use simulated mock data
expected from SKA-Low, with uncertainties estimated from different foreground
removal models, and constrain the parameters of primordial features within a
Bayesian framework. We study two scenarios: in the first scenario, where the
astrophysical parameters relevant to the evolution of the 21 cm signal are
known, we find that 21 cm power spectra do have the potential to probe the
primordial bump-like features. As the input amplitude of the bump is decreased
below roughly 10% of the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum without the
bump, the uncertainties in the recovered values for both amplitude and location
of the bump are found to increase, and the recovered values of the location of
the bump also get increasingly more biased towards higher values. Hence, it
becomes harder to constrain these parameters. In the second scenario, we
analyze the achievable constraints on primordial features when two of the
astrophysical parameters, namely, minimum halo mass and ionizing efficiency are
uncertain. We find that the effect of the bump on the shape and the amplitude
of the 21 cm power spectrum is distinct from the impact of varying the
astrophysical parameters, and hence they may potentially be distinguished.

via a tunneling through a barrier from nothing at the zero scale factor. We
explore the viability of this proposal for the spatially closed FLRW model with
a positive cosmological constant including quantum gravity modifications in the
Planck regime. Our setting is the effective spacetime description of loop
quantum cosmology (LQC) which is known to replace the big bang singularity with
a bounce due to the holonomy modifications. Due to the bounce, the barrier
potential of the Wheeler-DeWitt theory is replaced by a step like potential
which makes the tunneling proposal incompatible. But for a complete picture of
singularity resolution, inverse scale factor modifications from quantum
geometry must be included which play an important role at very small scale
factors in the spatially closed models. We show that with inclusion of inverse
scale factor modifications the resulting potential is again a barrier
potential. The universe at the vanishing scale factor is dynamically
non-singular and in an Einstein static like phase. We show that quantum
geometric effects in LQC provide a non-singular completion of Vilenkin's
tunneling proposal. We also find that quantum geometric effects result in a
possibility of a tunneling to a quantum cyclic universe albeit for a very large
value of cosmological constant determined by the quantum geometry.

nowadays. The extremely realistic games which are currently available trigger
high computational requirements of the user devices to run games. As a
consequence, the game industry has proposed the concept of Cloud Gaming, a
paradigm that improves gaming experience in reduced hardware devices. To this
end, games are hosted on remote servers, relegating users' devices to play only
the role of a peripheral for interacting with the game. However, this paradigm
overloads the communication links connecting the users with the cloud.
Therefore, service experience becomes highly dependent on network connectivity.
To overcome this, Cloud Gaming will be boosted by the promised performance of
5G and future 6G networks, together with the flexibility provided by mobility
in multi-RAT scenarios, such as WiFi. In this scope, the present work proposes
a framework for measuring and estimating the main E2E metrics of the Cloud
Gaming service, namely KQIs. In addition, different machine learning techniques
are assessed for predicting KQIs related to Cloud Gaming user's experience. To
this end, the main key quality indicators (KQIs) of the service such as input
lag, freeze percent or perceived video frame rate are collected in a real
environment. Based on these, results show that machine learning techniques
provide a good estimation of these indicators solely from network-based
metrics. This is considered a valuable asset to guide the delivery of Cloud
Gaming services through cellular communications networks even without access to
the user's device, as it is expected for telecom operators.

switching layer is reversibly modulated by creating and redistributing point
defects under an external field. Accurate simulations of the switching dynamics
of these devices can be difficult due to their typically disordered atomic
structures and inhomogeneous arrangements of defects. To address this, we
introduce an atomistic framework for modelling VCM cells. It combines a
stochastic Kinetic Monte Carlo approach for atomic rearrangement with a quantum
transport scheme, both parameterized at the ab-initio level by using inputs
from Density Functional Theory (DFT). Each of these steps operates directly on
the underlying atomic structure. The model thus directly relates the energy
landscape and electronic structure of the device to its switching
characteristics. We apply this model to simulate non-volatile switching between
high- and low-resistance states in an TiN/HfO2/Ti/TiN stack, and analyze both
the kinetics and stochasticity of the conductance transitions. We also resolve
the atomic nature of current flow resulting from the valence change mechanism,
finding that conductive paths are formed between the undercoordinated Hf atoms
neighboring oxygen vacancies. The model developed here can be applied to
different material systems to evaluate their resistive switching potential,
both for use as conventional memory cells and as neuromorphic computing
primitives.

backgrounds, allowing in particular for the presence of horizons, ergoregions
and trapped null geodesics, and including as a special case the Schwarzschild
and very slowly rotating $\vert a \vert \ll M$ Kerr family of black holes in
general relativity. There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The
first aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the
analysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted
estimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which
for large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately
follow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further
global bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of
a ""blackbox"" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary
metrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity
that need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation.
In the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous
estimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the
additional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases
(we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\vert a \vert \ll M$,
which can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of
Schwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for
producing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful
analysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave
operator of time-dependent metrics.

degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local

the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is
expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study
partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local
linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by
algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present
constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by
making a connection to the theory of prehomogenous tensor spaces. We highlight
the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification
results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a
natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations
gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of the tensor, which in turn allows
one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several
examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where
lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain
partial degenerations.

(NEPv) without the unitary invariance property. Those NEPv commonly arise as
the first-order optimality conditions of a particular type of optimization
problems over the Stiefel manifold, and previously, special cases have been
studied in the literature. Two necessary conditions, a definiteness condition
and a rank-preserving condition, on an eigenbasis matrix of the NEPv that is a
global optimizer of the associated problem optimization are revealed, where the
definiteness condition has been known for the special cases previously
investigated. We show that, locally close to the eigenbasis matrix satisfying
both necessary conditions, the NEPv can be reformulated as a unitarily
invariant NEPv, the so-called aligned NEPv, through a basis alignment operation
-- in other words, the NEPv is locally unitarily invariantizable. Numerically,
the NEPv is naturally solved by an SCF-type iteration. By exploiting the
differentiability of the coefficient matrix of the aligned NEPv, we establish a
closed-form local convergence rate for the SCF-type iteration and analyze its
level-shifted variant. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.

The identification of any conclusive deviation from the feature-less power-law
power spectrum will allow us to largely fathom out the microphysics of the
primordial universe. Here, we consider three vital theoretically motivated
feature models, namely, Sharp feature signal, Resonance feature signal, and
Bump feature. To investigate these features, we associate each feature model
with a specific scale-dependent function called a template. Here we explore
three distinct fiducial models for each feature model and for each fiducial

cosmological surveys. We implement the Fisher matrix forecast method to obtain

either a discriminative loss with margin, like the softmax loss with the
additive angular margin, or a metric learning loss, like the triplet loss with
batch hard mining of triplets. Since the softmax imposes feature normalization,
it limits the gradient flow supervising the feature embedding. We address this
by joining the losses and leveraging the triplet loss as a proxy for the
missing gradients. We further improve invariance to nuisance factors by adding
the discriminative task of predicting attributes. Our extensive evaluation
highlights that when only a holistic representation is learned, we consistently
outperform the state-of-the-art on the three most challenging datasets. Such
representations are easier to deploy in practical systems. Finally, we found
that joining the losses removes the requirement for having a margin in the
softmax loss while increasing performance.

reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in environments with high-dimensional
inputs, such as images, in an end-to-end fashion, mapping such inputs directly
to low-level control. Nevertheless, these have proved vulnerable to small
adversarial input perturbations. A number of approaches for improving or
certifying robustness of end-to-end RL to adversarial perturbations have
emerged as a result, focusing on cumulative reward. However, what is often at
stake in adversarial scenarios is the violation of fundamental properties, such
as safety, rather than the overall reward that combines safety with efficiency.
Moreover, properties such as safety can only be defined with respect to true
state, rather than the high-dimensional raw inputs to end-to-end policies. To
disentangle nominal efficiency and adversarial safety, we situate RL in
deterministic partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with the
goal of maximizing cumulative reward subject to safety constraints. We then
propose a partially-supervised reinforcement learning (PSRL) framework that
takes advantage of an additional assumption that the true state of the POMDP is
known at training time. We present the first approach for certifying safety of
PSRL policies under adversarial input perturbations, and two adversarial
training approaches that make direct use of PSRL. Our experiments demonstrate
both the efficacy of the proposed approach for certifying safety in adversarial

is a fundamental requirement for computer-assisted skull-base surgery. The
estimated motion can be used both for intra-operative guidance and for
downstream skill analysis. Recovering such motion solely from surgical videos
is desirable, as it is compliant with current clinical workflows and
instrumentation.
  Methods: We present Tracker of Anatomy and Tool (TAToo). TAToo jointly tracks
the rigid 3D motion of patient skull and surgical drill from stereo microscopic
videos. TAToo estimates motion via an iterative optimization process in an
end-to-end differentiable form. For robust tracking performance, TAToo adopts a
probabilistic formulation and enforces geometric constraints on the object
level.
  Results: We validate TAToo on both simulation data, where ground truth motion
is available, as well as on anthropomorphic phantom data, where optical
tracking provides a strong baseline. We report sub-millimeter and millimeter
inter-frame tracking accuracy for skull and drill, respectively, with rotation
errors below 1{\deg}. We further illustrate how TAToo may be used in a surgical
navigation setting.
  Conclusion: We present TAToo, which simultaneously tracks the surgical tool
and the patient anatomy in skull-base surgery. TAToo directly predicts the
motion from surgical videos, without the need of any markers. Our results show
that the performance of TAToo compares favorably to competing approaches.
Future work will include fine-tuning of our depth network to reach a 1 mm
clinical accuracy goal desired for surgical applications in the skull base.

application domains e.g., healthcare systems, supplychain management, has
raised the demand for a data query mechanism on blockchain. Since current
blockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security
and privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on
those systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries
to blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext. This directly
jeopardizes users' privacy as the submitted queries may contain sensitive
information, e.g., location or gender preferences, that the users may not be
comfortable sharing. On the other hand, currently, the only way for users to
ensure integrity of the query result is to maintain the entire blockchain
database and perform the queries locally. Doing so incurs high storage and
computational costs on the users, precluding this approach to be practically
deployable on common light-weight devices (e.g., smartphones). To this end,
this paper proposes $\pi$QLB, a query language for blockchain systems that
ensures both confidentiality of query inputs and integrity of query results.
Additionally, $\pi$QLB enables SQL-like queries over the blockchain data by
introducing relational data semantics into the existing blockchain database.
$\pi$QLB has applied the recent cryptography primitive, i.e., function secret
sharing (FSS), to achieve confidentiality. To support integrity, we extend the
traditional FSS setting in such a way that integrity of FSS results can be
efficiently verified. Successful verification indicates absence of malicious
behaviors on the servers, allowing the user to establish trust from the result.
To the best of our knowledge, $\pi$QLB is the first query model designed for
blockchain databases with support for confidentiality, integrity, and SQL-like

problem facing Trotter formulas is their inability to achieve poly-logarithmic
scaling with the error tolerance. We address this problem by providing a
well-conditioned extrapolation scheme that takes data from Trotter-Suzuki
simulations obtained for specifically chosen Trotter step sizes and estimates
the value that would be seen in the limit where the Trotter step size goes to

$\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ scaling for phase estimation and
$\tilde{O}(t^2/\epsilon)$ scaling for estimating time-evolved expectation
values for simulation time $t$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$. This is better
scaling with the error tolerance than the best known un-extrapolated Trotter
formulas. Additionally, we provide a new approach for phase estimation that is
unbiased and also provide a new approach for estimating the Trotter error on a
quantum computer through extrapolation which yields a new way to independently

investigate the polytropic behavior of solar wind protons over a wide range of

density and temperature over heliocentric distance, indicate that plasma
protons are governed by sub-adiabatic processes (polytropic index $\gamma$ <
5/3), if we assume protons with three effective kinetic degrees of freedom.
From the correlation between the small-scale variations of the plasma density
and temperature in selected sub-intervals, we derive a polytropic index
$\gamma$ ~ 1.4 on average. Further examination shows that the polytropic index
does not depend on the solar wind speed. This agrees with the results of
previous analyses of solar wind protons at ~ 1 au. We find that the polytropic
index varies slightly over the range of the heliocentric distances and
heliographic latitudes explored by Ulysses. We also show that the homogeneity
of the plasma and the accuracy of the polytropic model applied to the
data-points vary over Ulysses orbit. We compare our results with the results of

also come with high ambient neutron flux. Neutron capture-induced nuclear
recoils can create a spectrum that strongly overlaps the CE$\nu$NS signal for
recoils $\lesssim$\,100\,eV for nuclear reactor measurements in silicon or
germanium detectors. This background can be particularly critical for low-power
research reactors providing a moderate neutrino flux. In this work we quantify
the impact of this background and show that, for a measurement 10\,m from a
1\,MW reactor, the effective thermal neutron flux should be kept below
$\sim$~7$\times$~10$^{-4}$\,n/cm$^2$s so that the CE$\nu$NS events can be
measured at least at a 5$\sigma$ level with germanium detectors in 100~kg\,yr
exposure time. This flux corresponds to 60\% of the sea-level flux but needs to
be achieved in a nominally high-flux (reactor) environment. Improved detector
resolution can help the measurements, but the thermal flux is the key parameter
for the sensitivity of the experiment. For silicon detectors, the constraint is
even stronger and thermal neutron fluxes must be near an order of magnitude
lower. This constraint highlights the need of an effective thermal neutron
mitigation strategy for future low threshold CE$\nu$NS searches. In particular,
the neutron capture-induced background can be efficiently reduced by active
veto systems tagging the deexcitation gamma following the capture.

relatively small but not infinitesimal, thus fitting well with the practical
implementation of neural networks. Currently, discrete gradient dynamics
analysis has been successfully applied to shallow networks but encounters the
difficulty of complex computation for deep networks. In this work, we introduce
another discrete gradient dynamics approach to explain implicit regularization,
i.e. landscape analysis. It mainly focuses on gradient regions, such as saddle
points and local minima. We theoretically establish the connection between
saddle point escaping (SPE) stages and the matrix rank in DMF. We prove that,
for a rank-R matrix reconstruction, DMF will converge to a second-order
critical point after R stages of SPE. This conclusion is further experimentally
verified on a low-rank matrix reconstruction problem. This work provides a new
theory to analyze implicit regularization in deep learning.

The numerical scheme is validated firstly by a series of benchmark simulations

symmetric case where the fibers are placed on the symmetry center of Couette
flows and we focus on the effects of the fiber stiffness, the confinement
strength, and the finite Reynolds number (from 1 to 10). A diagram of the fiber
shape is obtained. For fibers under weak confinement and a small Reynolds
number, three distinct tumbling orbits have been identified. (1) Jeffery orbits
of rigid fibers. The fibers behave like rigid rods and tumble periodically
without any visible deformation. (2) S-turn orbits of slightly flexible fibers.
The fiber is bent to an S-shape and is straightened again when it orients to an
angle of around 45 degrees relative to the positive x direction. (3) S-coiled
orbits of fairly flexible fibers. The fiber is folded to an S-shape and tumbles
periodically and steadily without being straightened anymore during its
rotation. Moreover, the fiber tumbling is found to be hindered by increasing
either the Reynolds number or the confinement strength, or both.

as the prior information to assist in segmenting the current frame. Although
the previous methods achieve superior performances on the independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d) data, they can not generalize well on other
unseen domains. Thus, we explore a new task, the video generalizable semantic
segmentation (VGSS) task that considers both continuous frames and domain
generalization. In this paper, we propose a class-wise non-salient region

class-wise non-salient feature, which describes features of the class-wise
non-salient region that carry more generalizable information. Then, we propose
a class-wise non-salient feature reasoning strategy to select and enhance the
most generalized channels adaptively. Finally, we propose an inter-frame

demonstrate that our CNSG framework yields significant improvement in the VGSS

This need is particularly critical because join is a ubiquitous operation in

the traditional CNNs that utilizing convolutional operations with large kernel

To this end, we propose to improve the performance of binary MLP (BiMLP) model

data-dependent singular inversion operator. The Bayesian approach overcomes the
ill-posedness through a non-degenerate prior. However, a fixed non-degenerate
prior leads to a divergent posterior mean when the observation noise becomes
small, if the data induces a perturbation in the eigenspace of zero eigenvalues
of the inversion operator. We introduce a data-adaptive prior to achieve a
stable posterior whose mean always has a small noise limit. The data-adaptive
prior's covariance is the inversion operator with a hyper-parameter selected
adaptive to data by the L-curve method. Furthermore, we provide a detailed
analysis on the computational practice of the data-adaptive prior, and
demonstrate it on Toeplitz matrices and integral operators. Numerical tests
show that a fixed prior can lead to a divergent posterior mean in the presence

negative-energy orbital problem are examined on the basis of the quantum
electrodynamics (QED) Hamiltonian. First, several QED Hamiltonians previously
proposed are sifted by the orbital rotation invariance, the charge conjugation
and time reversal invariance, and the nonrelativistic limit. A new total energy
expression is then proposed, in which a counter term corresponding to the
energy of the polarized vacuum is subtracted from the total energy. This
expression prevents the possibility of total energy divergence due to electron
correlations, stemming from the fact that the QED Hamiltonian does not conserve
the number of particles. Finally, based on the Hamiltonian and energy
expression, the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) and electron correlation methods are
reintroduced. The resulting QED-based DHF equation has the same form as the
conventional DHF equation, but also formally describes systems specific to QED,
such as the virtual positrons in the hydride ion and the positron in
positronium. Three electron correlation methods are derived: the QED-based
configuration interactions and single- and multireference perturbation methods.
Numerical calculations show that the total energy of the QED Hamiltonian indeed
diverges and that the counter term is effective in avoiding the divergence. The
theoretical examinations in the present article suggest that the molecular
orbital (MO) methods based on the QED Hamiltonian not only solve the problem of
the negative-energy solutions of the relativistic MO method, but also provide a
relativistic formalism to treat systems containing positrons.

variability in the tropics, significantly impacting global weather and climate.
In this paper, a framework of low-order conceptual models for the ENSO is
systematically derived from a spatially-extended stochastic dynamical system
with full mathematical rigor. The spatially-extended stochastic dynamical
system has a linear, deterministic, and stable dynamical core. It also exploits
a simple stochastic process with multiplicative noise to parameterize the
intraseasonal wind burst activities. A principal component analysis based on
the eigenvalue decomposition method is applied to provide a low-order
conceptual model that succeeds in characterizing the large-scale dynamical and
non-Gaussian statistical features of the eastern Pacific El Ni\~no events.
Despite the low dimensionality, the conceptual modeling framework contains
outputs for all the atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature components
with detailed spatiotemporal patterns. This contrasts with many existing
conceptual models focusing only on a small set of specified state variables.
The stochastic versions of many state-of-the-art low-order models, such as the
recharge-discharge and the delayed oscillators, become special cases within
this framework. The rigorous derivation of such low-order models provides a
unique way to connect models with different spatiotemporal complexities. The
framework also facilitates understanding the instantaneous and memory effects
of stochastic noise in contributing to the large-scale dynamics of the ENSO.

require a large computational cost. Meanwhile, the activation function will
cause some features of the intermediate layer to be lost. Therefore, it is a
challenge to make the model lightweight while reducing the impact of
intermediate feature loss on the reconstruction quality. In this paper, we
propose a Feature Interaction Weighted Hybrid Network (FIWHN) to alleviate the
above problem. Specifically, FIWHN consists of a series of novel Wide-residual
Distillation Interaction Blocks (WDIB) as the backbone, where every third WDIBs
form a Feature shuffle Weighted Group (FSWG) by mutual information mixing and
fusion. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of intermediate feature
loss on the reconstruction results, we introduced a well-designed Wide
Convolutional Residual Weighting (WCRW) and Wide Identical Residual Weighting
(WIRW) units in WDIB, and effectively cross-fused features of different
finenesses through a Wide-residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) framework and
a Self-Calibrating Fusion (SCF) unit. Finally, to complement the global
features lacking in the CNN model, we introduced the Transformer into our model
and explored a new way of combining the CNN and Transformer. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on low-level and high-level tasks show
that our proposed FIWHN can achieve a good balance between performance and
efficiency, and is more conducive to downstream tasks to solve problems in
low-pixel scenarios.

especially when nodes with long-range connectivity to the labeled anchors are
encountered. To alleviate this limitation, we purposefully designed WL-Align
which adopts a regularized representation learning framework to learn
distinctive node representations. It extends the Weisfeiler-Lehman Isormorphism
Test and learns the alignment in alternating phases of ""across-network
Weisfeiler-Lehman relabeling"" and ""proximity-preserving representation
learning"". The across-network Weisfeiler-Lehman relabeling is achieved through
iterating the anchor-based label propagation and a similarity-based hashing to
exploit the known anchors' connectivity to different nodes in an efficient and
robust manner. The representation learning module preserves the second-order
proximity within individual networks and is regularized by the across-network
Weisfeiler-Lehman hash labels. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets have demonstrated that our proposed WL-Align outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements in the

microservice platforms are emerging as an important part of production control.
In the containerized deployment of microservices, layer sharing can reduce the
huge bandwidth consumption caused by image pulling, and chain sharing can
reduce communication overhead caused by communication between microservices.
The two sharing methods use the characteristics of each microservice to share
resources during deployment. However, due to the limited resources of edge
servers, it is difficult to meet the optimization goals of the two methods at
the same time. Therefore, it is of critical importance to realize the
improvement of service response efficiency by balancing the two sharing
methods. This paper studies the optimal microservice deployment strategy that
can balance layer sharing and chain sharing of microservices. We build a
problem that minimizes microservice image pull delay and communication overhead
and transform the problem into a linearly constrained integer quadratic
programming problem through model reconstruction. A deployment strategy is
obtained through the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Experimental
results show that the proposed deployment strategy can balance the two resource
sharing methods. When the two sharing methods are equally considered, the
average image pull delay can be reduced to 65% of the baseline, and the average
communication overhead can be reduced to 30% of the baseline.

the Gauss-Markov theorem continues to hold without the requirement that
competing estimators are linear in the vector of outcomes. Despite the elegant
proof, it was shown by the authors and other researchers that the main result
in the earlier version of Hansen's paper does not extend the classic
Gauss-Markov theorem because no nonlinear unbiased estimator exists under his
conditions. To address the issue, Hansen [2022] added statements in the latest
version with new conditions under which nonlinear unbiased estimators exist.
  Motivated by the lively discussion, we study a fundamental problem: what
estimators are unbiased for a given class of linear models? We first review a
line of highly relevant work dating back to the 1960s, which, unfortunately,
have not drawn enough attention. Then, we introduce notation that allows us to
restate and unify results from earlier work and Hansen [2022]. The new
framework also allows us to highlight differences among previous conclusions.
Lastly, we establish new representation theorems for unbiased estimators under
different restrictions on the linear model, allowing the coefficients and
covariance matrix to take only a finite number of values, the higher moments of
the estimator and the dependent variable to exist, and the error distribution
to be discrete, absolutely continuous, or dominated by another probability
measure. Our results substantially generalize the claims of parallel
commentaries on Hansen [2022] and a remarkable result by Koopmann [1982].

for P-frame coding. B-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0 content is largely
under-explored. In addition, while there have been prior works on variable-rate
coding with conditional convolution, most of them fail to consider the content
information. We build our scheme on conditional augmented normalized flows
(CANF). It features conditional motion and inter-frame codecs for efficient
B-frame coding. To cope with YUV 4:2:0 content, two conditional inter-frame
codecs are used to process the Y and UV components separately, with the coding
of the UV components conditioned additionally on the Y component. Moreover, we
introduce adaptive feature modulation in every convolutional layer, taking into
account both the content information and the coding levels of B-frames to
achieve content-adaptive variable-rate coding. Experimental results show that
our model outperforms x265 and the winner of last year's challenge on commonly

performs 913 KOPS and 88 KOPS for NTT and HMULT (key FHE kernels) within NVIDIA

(e.g., crowd counting, traffic statistics), aims to predict the number of
objects with various densities. Existing object counting tasks are designed for
a single object class. However, it is inevitable to encounter newly coming data
with new classes in our real world. We name this scenario as \textit{evolving
object counting}. In this paper, we build the first evolving object counting
dataset and propose a unified object counting network as the first attempt to
address this task. The proposed model consists of two key components: a
class-agnostic mask module and a class-incremental module. The class-agnostic
mask module learns generic object occupation prior via predicting a
class-agnostic binary mask (e.g., 1 denotes there exists an object at the
considering position in an image and 0 otherwise). The class-incremental module
is used to handle new coming classes and provides discriminative class guidance
for density map prediction. The combined outputs of class-agnostic mask module
and image feature extractor are used to predict the final density map. When new
classes come, we first add new neural nodes into the last regression and
classification layers of class-incremental module. Then, instead of retraining
the model from scratch, we utilize knowledge distillation to help the model
remember what have already learned about previous object classes. We also
employ a support sample bank to store a small number of typical training
samples of each class, which are used to prevent the model from forgetting key
information of old data. With this design, our model can efficiently and
effectively adapt to new coming classes while keeping good performance on
already seen data without large-scale retraining. Extensive experiments on the
collected dataset demonstrate the favorable performance.

structures. In this study, the process of formation of structures is
investigated with the help of Molecular (MD) simulations in 2 and 3 dimensions.
The overall medium has been modelled with an equal number of positive and
negatively charged particles interacting via long-range pair Coulomb potential.
A repulsive short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential is added to take care of
the blowing up of attractive Coulomb interaction between unlike charges. In the
strongly coupled regime, a variety of classical bound states form. However,
complete crystallization of the system, as typically observed in the context of
one component strongly coupled plasmas, does not occur. The influence of
localized perturbation in the system has also been studied. The formation of a
crystalline pattern of shielding clouds around this disturbance is observed.
The spatial properties of the shielding structure have been analyzed using the
radial distribution function and Voronoi diagram. The process of accumulation
of oppositely charged particles around the disturbance triggers a lot of
dynamical activity in the bulk of the medium, wherein close encounters between
widely separated particles occur. This leads to the formation of a larger
number of bigger clusters. There are, however, also instances when bound pairs
break up to provide the appropriate signed charge to the shielding cloud. A
detailed discussion of these features has been provided in the manuscript.

machine-learning potential model, we present results of large-scale atomistic
simulations of stacking DWs and Moir\'e structure of boron nitride bilayers. We
predict that the competition between the switching barrier of stable
ferroelectric states and the in-plane lattice distortion leads to a DW width of
the order of ten nanometers. DWs motion reduces the critical ferroelectric
switching field of a monodomain by two orders of magnitude, while high
domain-wall velocities allow domain switching on a picosecond-timescale. The
superior performance compared to conventional ferroelectrics (or ferromagnets)
may enable ultrafast and power-saving non-volatile memories. By twisting the
bilayer into a stacking Moir\'e structure, the ferroelectric transforms into a
super-paraelectric since DWs move under ultralow electric fields.

the episode rather than the original forward trajectory. This gives the agent a
strong reward signal, so the agent can learn in a more sample-efficient manner.
Moreover, our method only requires a minor change in algorithm, which is
reversing the order of trajectory before training the agent. Therefore, it can
be simply applied to any state-of-art algorithms.

performance over conventional convolutional neural networks(CNNs). However,
transformers usually require a much larger amount of memory to train than CNNs,

which divides the network into several distinct modules and trains them
individually, is a promising alternative to the end-to-end (E2E) training
approach to reduce the amount of memory for training and to increase
parallelism. This paper is the first to apply Local Learning on transformers
for this purpose. The standard CNN-based local learning method, InfoPro [32],
reconstructs the input images for each module in a CNN. However, reconstructing
the entire image does not generalize well. In this paper, we propose a new
mechanism for each local module, where instead of reconstructing the entire

evaluate our approach on 4 commonly used datasets and 3 commonly used decoder

where we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we
use to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the
form of distance predictions: each node $v$ provides a prediction $f(v)$ of its
distance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can
reach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable

reasonably high $T_\text{C}$, but with a very low coercive field, $H_\text{c}$
($\lesssim$100~Oe). Some of the common techniques of enhancing $H_\text{c}$ are
by introducing pinning centers, defects, stress, doping, etc. They involve the
risk of undesirable alteration of other important magnetic properties. Here we
propose a very easy, robust, and highly effective method of phase engineering
by altering the sample growth conditions to greatly enhance the intrinsic
coercivity (7-10 times) of the sample, without compromising its fundamental
magnetic properties ($T_\text{C}\simeq$210K). The phase-engineered sample
(F3GT-2) comprises of parent F3GT phase with a small percentage of randomly
embedded clusters of a coplanar FeTe (FT) phase. The FT phase serves as both
mosaic pinning centers between grains of F3GT above its antiferromagnetic
transition temperature ($T_\text{C1}\sim$70~K) and also as anti-phase domains
below $T_\text{C1}$. As a result, the grain boundary disorder and metastable
nature are greatly augmented, leading to highly enhanced coercivity, cluster
spin glass, and meta-magnetic behavior. The enhanced coercivity ($\simeq$1~kOe)
makes F3GT-2 much more useful for memory storage applications and is likely to
elucidate a new route to tune useful magnetic properties. Moreover, this method
is much more convenient than hetero-structure and other cumbersome techniques.

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Unlike Runge--Kutta DG schemes that
overwrite finite element solutions with WENO reconstructions, our approach uses
a reconstruction-based smoothness sensor to blend the numerical viscosity
operators of high- and low-order stabilization terms. The so-defined WENO
approximation introduces low-order nonlinear diffusion in the vicinity of
shocks, while preserving the high-order accuracy of a linearly stable baseline
discretization in regions where the exact solution is sufficiently smooth. The
underlying reconstruction procedure performs Hermite interpolation on stencils
consisting of a mesh cell and its neighbors. The amount of numerical
dissipation depends on the relative differences between partial derivatives of
reconstructed candidate polynomials and those of the underlying finite element
approximation. All derivatives are taken into account by the employed
smoothness sensor. To assess the accuracy of our CG-WENO scheme, we derive
error estimates and perform numerical experiments. In particular, we prove that
the consistency error of the nonlinear stabilization is of the order $p+1/2$,
where $p$ is the polynomial degree. This estimate is optimal for general
meshes. For uniform meshes and smooth exact solutions, the experimentally
observed rate of convergence is as high as $p+1$.

perception contains a series of laws to explain human perception, that the
human visual system tends to perceive patches in an image that are similar,
close or connected without abrupt directional changes as a perceptual whole

as the primary infrastructure for M2M communications, there are several key
issues to be addressed in order to deploy M2M communications over cellular
networks. Notably, the rapid growth of M2M traffic dramatically increases
energy consumption, as well as degrades the performance of existing
Human-to-Human (H2H) traffic. Sustainable operation technology and resource
management are efficacious ways for solving these issues. In this paper, we
investigate a resource management problem in cellular networks with H2H/M2M
coexistence. First, considering the energy-constrained nature of machine type
communication devices (MTCDs), we propose a novel network model enabled by
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which empowers
MTCDs with the ability to simultaneously perform energy harvesting (EH) and
information decoding. Given the diverse characteristics of IoT devices, we
subdivide MTCDs into critical and tolerable types, further formulating the
resource management problem as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem
under divers Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. Then, we develop a
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme to solve this
problem. It provides optimal spectrum, transmit power and power splitting (PS)
ratio allocation policies, along with efficient model training under designed
behaviour-tracking based state space and common reward function. Finally, we
verify that with a reasonable training mechanism, multiple M2M agents
successfully work cooperatively in a distributed way, resulting in network
performance that outperforms other intelligence approaches in terms of
convergence speed and meeting the EE and QoS requirements.

temperature gradient. It has several advantages compared with the longitudinal
thermoelectricity for energy conversion, such as decoupling of electronic and
thermal transports, higher flexibility, and simpler lateral structure. However,
a design principle beyond specific materials systems for obtaining a large
anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is still absent. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate that a pair of Dirac nodes under a Zeeman field
manifests a double-peak anomalous Hall conductivity curve with respect to the
chemical potential and a compensated carriers feature, leading to an enhanced
ANC pinning at the Fermi level compared with that of a simple Weyl semimetal
with two Weyl nodes. Based on first-principles calculations, we then provide
two Dirac semimetal candidates, i.e., Na3Bi and NaTeAu, and show that under a
Zeeman field they exhibit a sizable ANC value of 0.4 A/(m*K) and 1.3 A/(m*K),
respectively, near the Fermi level. Our work provides a design principle with a
prototype band structure for enhanced ANC pinning at Fermi level, shedding
light on the inverse design of other specific functional materials base on
electronic structure.

formation properties) is a major challenge. One of the corresponding tasks is a
well-interval similarity assessment: if we can learn to predict which oilfields
are rich and which are not by comparing them with existing ones, this will lead
to significant cost reductions. There are three main requirements for applying
machine learning to oil&gas data: high quality even for unreliable data, low
manual effort and interpretability of the model itself. Neural networks can be
used to address these challenges. The use of a self-supervised paradigm leads
to automatic model construction. However, existing approaches lack
interpretability, and their quality prevents their use in applications. In
particular, existing approaches like LSTM suffer from short-term memory, paying
more attention to the end of a sequence. Instead, neural networks with
Transformer architecture cast their attention over all sequences to make a
decision. To make them more efficient in terms of computational time and more
robust to noisy or absent values, we introduce a limited attention mechanism
similar to that of the Informer architecture that considers only top
correspondences. We run experiments on an open dataset with more than $20$
wells, making our experiments reliable and suitable for industrial use. The
best results were obtained with our adaptation of the Informer variant of
Transformer with ROC AUC $0.982$. It outperforms classical approaches with ROC
AUC $0.824$, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with ROC AUC $0.934$ and the
direct use of Transformer with ROC AUC $0.961$. We show that well-interval

projected Newton's approach combined with a gradient descent algorithm so that
every limit point of the sequence generated by the overall algorithm is a
stationary point. More importantly, we suggest replacing the standard
orthogonal projector with a novel operator that ensures the final solution to
satisfy the box constraints while lowering the probability that the
intermediate points reached at each iteration belong to the boundary of the box

topic due to its wide application and considerable popularity. However, due to
the combinatorial explosion of the search space when the HUSPM problem
encounters a low utility threshold or large-scale data, it may be
time-consuming and memory-costly to address the HUSPM problem. Several
algorithms have been proposed for addressing this problem, but they still cost
a lot in terms of running time and memory usage. In this paper, to further
solve this problem efficiently, we design a compact structure called sequence
projection (seqPro) and propose an efficient algorithm, namely discovering
high-utility sequential patterns with the seqPro structure (HUSP-SP). HUSP-SP
utilizes the compact seq-array to store the necessary information in a sequence
database. The seqPro structure is designed to efficiently calculate candidate
patterns' utilities and upper bound values. Furthermore, a new upper bound on
utility, namely tighter reduced sequence utility (TRSU) and two pruning
strategies in search space, are utilized to improve the mining performance of
HUSP-SP. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life datasets show
that HUSP-SP can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in
terms of running time, memory usage, search space pruning efficiency, and
scalability.

method, dubbed HIER, to discover the latent semantic hierarchy of training

supervision than inter-class separability induced by common metric learning
losses.HIER achieves this goal with no annotation for the semantic hierarchy
but by learning hierarchical proxies in hyperbolic spaces. The hierarchical
proxies are learnable parameters, and each of them is trained to serve as an
ancestor of a group of data or other proxies to approximate the semantic
hierarchy among them. HIER deals with the proxies along with data in hyperbolic
space since the geometric properties of the space are well-suited to represent
their hierarchical structure. The efficacy of HIER is evaluated on four
standard benchmarks, where it consistently improved the performance of
conventional methods when integrated with them, and consequently achieved the
best records, surpassing even the existing hyperbolic metric learning

switched stochastic systems against probabilistic reach-avoid specifications,
defined as the probability of reaching a goal region while being safe. In
particular, we consider stochastic systems with additive noise, whose
distribution lies in an ambiguity set of distributions that are
$\varepsilon-$close to a nominal one according to the Wasserstein distance. For
this class of systems, we derive control synthesis algorithms that are robust
against all these distributions and maximize the probability of satisfying a

of a switched stochastic system as a robust Markov decision process (robust
MDP) by accounting for both the stochasticity of the system and the uncertainty
in the noise distribution. Then, it synthesizes a strategy on the resulting
robust MDP that maximizes the probability of satisfying the property and is
robust to all uncertainty in the system. This strategy is then refined into a
switching strategy for the original stochastic system. By exploiting tools from
optimal transport and stochastic programming, we show that synthesizing such a
strategy reduces to solving a set of linear programs, thus guaranteeing
efficiency. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our framework on various

  Optimization in Urban Canyons","11 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate and smooth global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning for
pedestrians in urban canyons is still a challenge due to the multipath effects
and the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) receptions caused by the reflections from
surrounding buildings. The recently developed factor graph optimization (FGO)
based GNSS positioning method opened a new window for improving urban GNSS
positioning by effectively exploiting the measurement redundancy from the
historical information to resist the outlier measurements. Unfortunately, the
FGO-based GNSS standalone positioning is still challenged in highly urbanized
areas. As an extension of the previous FGO-based GNSS positioning method, this
paper exploits the potential of the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) model in
FGO to improve the GNSS standalone positioning performance in urban canyons.
Specifically, the relative motion of the pedestrian is estimated based on the
raw acceleration measurements from the onboard smartphone inertial measurement
unit (IMU) via the PDR algorithm. Then the raw GNSS pseudorange, Doppler
measurements, and relative motion from PDR are integrated using the FGO. Given
the context of pedestrian navigation with a small acceleration most of the
time, a novel soft motion model is proposed to smooth the states involved in
the factor graph model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified
step-by-step through two datasets collected in dense urban canyons of Hong Kong
using smartphone-level GNSS receivers. The comparison between the conventional
extended Kalman filter, several existing methods, and FGO-based integration is
presented. The results reveal that the existing FGO-based GNSS standalone
positioning is highly complementary to the PDR's relative motion estimation.
Both improved positioning accuracy and trajectory smoothness are obtained with
the help of the proposed method.

Astrochemistry. Here, we study, by means of quantum mechanical simulations, the
formation of NH3 via successive H-additions to atomic N on water ice surfaces,

that around 58--90\% of the released energy is quickly absorbed by the ice
surface, inducing a temporary increase of the ice temperature. Different energy
dissipation mechanisms are distinguished. One mechanism, more general, is based

topology-varying generic objects in an unsupervised manner. Conventional
implicit functions estimate the occupancy of a 3D point given a shape latent

to represent each 3D point in a part embedding space. Assuming the
corresponding points are similar in the embedding space, we implement dense
correspondence through an inverse function mapping from the part embedding
vector to a corresponded 3D point. Both functions are jointly learned with
several effective and uncertainty-aware loss functions to realize our
assumption, together with the encoder generating the shape latent code. During
inference, if a user selects an arbitrary point on the source shape, our
algorithm can automatically generate a confidence score indicating whether
there is a correspondence on the target shape, as well as the corresponding
semantic point if there is one. Such a mechanism inherently benefits man-made
objects with different part constitutions. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated through unsupervised 3D semantic correspondence and shape

challenging to manage. The ubiquitous system logs contain plentiful information
and are thus widely exploited as an alternative source for system management.
As log files usually encompass large amounts of raw data, manually analyzing
them is laborious and error-prone. Consequently, many research endeavors have
been devoted to automatic log analysis. However, these works typically expect
structured input and struggle with the heterogeneous nature of raw system logs.
Log parsing closes this gap by converting the unstructured system logs to
structured records. Many parsers were proposed during the last decades to
accommodate various log analysis applications. However, due to the ample
solution space and lack of systematic evaluation, it is not easy for
practitioners to find ready-made solutions that fit their needs.
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on log parsing. We begin
with an exhaustive taxonomy of existing log parsers. Then we empirically
analyze the critical performance and operational features for 17 open-source
solutions both quantitatively and qualitatively, and whenever applicable
discuss the merits of alternative approaches. We also elaborate on future
challenges and discuss the relevant research directions. We envision this
survey as a helpful resource for system administrators and domain experts to
choose the most desirable open-source solution or implement new ones based on
application-specific requirements.

enabling the learning to be aware of old classes. Besides, attention mechanism

dramatic contrast, for $m_{\rm major}:m_{\rm minor}=1:3$, a minor-component

total density profile, for both halo and soliton, is thus dominated by the
major component and closely follows the single-component case. To support this

is trivial. It turns out that many groups satisfy this property; and we
initiate the formal study of this phenomenon. Of particular importance is the
proof of a dynamical criterion in this paper that ensures that groups with rich
actions on compact Hausdorff spaces have Property (NL). These include many
Thompson-like groups, such as $V, T$ and even twisted Brin--Thompson groups,

excitation-number-dependent Stark shifts of the qutrit transition frequencies,
we are able to individually control the amplitudes of specified Fock states of
the resonators associated with relevant qutrit transition, using carefully
tailored microwave drive signals. Thereby an arbitrary bipartite entangled
state in Fock space can be generated by a typical evolution-and-measurement

trusted industrial network, which however can be brittle once deployed in an
Internet-facing (or penetrated) network. Yet, there is a lack of systematic
empirical analysis of the run-time security of modern real-world PLCs. To close
this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement on 23 off-the-shelf PLCs

implications that should be more carefully addressed in the design and
implementation. To sum up, the unsupervised logic applications can cause system
resource/privilege abuse, which gives adversaries new means to hijack the
control flow of a runtime system remotely (without exploiting memory
vulnerabilities); 2) the improper access control mechanisms bring many
unauthorized access implications; 3) the proprietary or semi-proprietary

multiple PLCs, which demonstrates that the security implications are severe and
broad. Our findings were reported to the related parties responsibly, and 20

exothermically reacting Euler flows in an almost flat nozzle with the small

determine the position of the shock front in the nozzle. We focus on the
contributions of the perturbation of the flat nozzle and the exothermic
reaction in determining the position of the shock front by comparing the orders
of $\sigma$ and $\kappa$, where $\sigma$ represents the scale of the
perturbation of the flat nozzle and $\kappa$ the rate of the exothermic

Euler system is proposed to catch an approximating position of the shock front
as well as the associated approximating shock solution, with which the
existence of a shock solution close to it can be established via a nonlinear
iteration scheme. One of the key steps is solving the nonlinear equation
derived from the solvability condition for the elliptic sub-problem in the
domain of the subsonic flow behind the shock front, which determines the free
boundary of the proposed problem. Four typical cases are analyzed which
describe possible interactions between the geometry of the nozzle boundary and
the exothermic reaction. The results also manifest that exothermic reaction has
a stabilization effect on transonic shocks in the nozzles.

RBM is an efficient and accurate emulator for the strong correlations induced
by the pairing interaction in a variety of finite systems like ultrasmall
superconducting grains, interacting topological superfluids and mesoscopic
hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, all of which require an expensive,
beyond-mean-field, particle-number conserving description. These systems are
modelled by the number-conserving Richardson pairing Hamiltonian and its
appropriate generalizations. Their ground state is solved for exactly using the
Density Matrix Renormalization Group. The reduced basis is assembled
iteratively from a small number of exact ground state vectors, well-chosen from
across the relevant parameter space using a fast estimate of the emulation
error and a greedy local optimization algorithm. The reduced basis emulation is
found to accurately describe the weak-to-strong pairing cross-over in small
grains, the third-order topological phase transition of the interacting
Richardson-Kitaev chain, and the complex charge stability diagram of a hybrid
quantum dot - superconductor device. RBMs are thus confirmed to be cheap and
accurate emulators for the widely encountered superconducting phenomena.
Capable of providing orders of magnitude computational speed-up with respect to

Equilibrium (NE) and can lead to outcomes with better social welfare. However,
its natural extension to the sequential setting, the \textit{Extensive Form

even in restricted settings without randomness in nature. To alleviate these
concerns, we apply \textit{subgame resolving}, a technique extremely successful
in finding NE in zero-sum games to solving general-sum EFCEs. Subgame resolving
refines a correlation plan in an \textit{online} manner: instead of solving for
the full game upfront, it only solves for strategies in subgames that are
reached in actual play, resulting in significant computational gains. In this
paper, we (i) lay out the foundations to quantify the quality of a refined
strategy, in terms of the \textit{social welfare} and \textit{exploitability}
of correlation plans, (ii) show that EFCEs possess a sufficient amount of
independence between subgames to perform resolving efficiently, and (iii)
provide two algorithms for resolving, one using linear programming and the
other based on regret minimization. Both methods guarantee \textit{safety},

quaternion tensor methods in the color video processing has encountered a
challenge, which is the block diagonalization of block circulant quaternion
matrices. In this paper, we show that the discrete Fourier matrix
$\mathbf{F_p}$ cannot diagonalize $p\times p$ circulant quaternion matrices,
nor can the unitary quaternion matrices $\mathbf{F_p}\mathbf{j}$ and
$\mathbf{F_p}(1+\mathbf{j})/\sqrt{2}$ with $\mathbf{j}$ being an imaginary unit
of quaternion algebra. Further, we establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for a unitary quaternion matrix being a diagonalization matrix of
circulant quaternion matrices, which shows that achieving the diagonalization
of circulant quaternion matrices in the quaternion domain is too hard. We turn
to the octonion domain for achieving the diagonalization of circulant
quaternion matrices. We prove that the unitary octonion matrix
$\mathbf{F_p}\mathbf{p}$ with $\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{l},\mathbf{il}$ or
$(\mathbf{l}+\mathbf{il})/\sqrt{2}$ can diagonalize a circulant quaternion
matrix of size $p\times p$, at the cost of $O(p\log p)$ via the fast Fourier

diagonalize a block circulant quaternion matrix of size $mp\times np$, at the

calculate the T-product between $m\times n\times p$ and $n\times s\times p$
third-order quaternion tensors via FFTs, at the cost of $O(mnsp)$, which is
almost $1/p$ of the computational magnitude of computing T-product by its

sharing of various forms of quantum correlations, viz., nonlocality,

explore the sequential sharing of nonlocality in a quantum network. We first
consider the simplest case of the two-input bilocality scenario that features
two independent sources and three parties, including two edge parties and a
central party. We demonstrate that in the symmetric case when the sharing is
considered for both the edge parties, the nonlocality can be shared by at most
two sequential observers per edge party. However, in the asymmetric case, when
the sharing across one edge party is considered, we show that at most, six
sequential observers can share the nonlocality in the network. We extend our
investigation to the two-input $n$-local scenario in the star-network
configuration that features an arbitrary $n$ number of edge parties and one
central party. In the asymmetric case, we demonstrate that the network
nonlocality can be shared by an unbounded number of sequential observers across
one edge party for a suitably large value of $n$. Further, we generalize our
study for an arbitrary $m$ input $n$-local scenario in the star-network
configuration. We show that even for an arbitrary $m$ input scenario, the
nonlocality can be shared by an unbounded number of sequential observers.
However, increasing the input $m$, one has to employ more number of edge
parties $n$ than that of the two-input case to demonstrate the sharing of an
unbounded number of sequential observers.

multipartite Bell nonlocality. In recent times, network nonlocality has been
studied for various topologies. We consider a linear-chain topology of the
network and demonstrate the quantum nonlocality (the non-$n$-locality). Such a
network scenario involves $n$ number of independent sources and $n+1$ parties,
two edge parties (Alice and Charlie), and $n-1$ central parties (Bobs). It is
commonly assumed that each party receives only two inputs. In this work, we
consider a generalized scenario where the edge parties receive an arbitrary $n$
number of inputs (equals to a number of independent sources), and each of the
central parties receives two inputs. We derive a family of generalized
$n$-locality inequalities for a linear-chain network for arbitrary $n$ and
demonstrate the optimal quantum violation of the inequalities. We introduce an
elegant sum-of-squares approach enabling the derivation of the optimal quantum
violation of aforesaid inequalities \emph{without} assuming the dimension of
the system. We show that the optimal quantum violation requires the observables
of edge parties to mutually anticommuting. For $n=2$ and $3$, the optimal
quantum violation can be obtained when each edge party shares a two-qubit
entangled state with central parties. We further argue that for $n\geq 2$, a
single copy of a two-qubit-entangled state may not be enough to exhibit the
violation of $n$-locality inequality, but multiple copies of it can activate
the quantum violation.

per-loss reinsurance from the reinsurer. With the insurer's feedback
reinsurance strategy, the reinsurer optimizes the reinsurance premium in the
Stackelberg game. The financial market consists of cash and stock with Heston's
stochastic volatility. Both the insurer and reinsurer maximize their respective
$\alpha$-maxmin mean-variance preferences in the market. The criterion is
time-inconsistent and we derive the equilibrium strategies by the extended
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Similar to the non-robust case in Li and
Young (2022), excess-of-loss reinsurance is the optimal form of reinsurance
strategy for the insurer. The equilibrium investment strategy is determined by
a system of Riccati differential equations. Besides, the equations determining
the equilibrium reinsurance strategy and reinsurance premium rate are given
semi-explicitly, which is simplified to an algebraic equation in a specific
example. Numerical examples illustrate that the game between the insurer and
reinsurer makes the insurance more radical when the agents become more
ambiguity aversion or risk aversion. Furthermore, the level of ambiguity,
ambiguity attitude, and risk attitude of the insurer (reinsurer) have similar
effects on the equilibrium reinsurance strategy, reinsurance premium, and
investment strategy.

description of the temporal evolution of out-of-equilibrium disordered quantum

investigate it in the context of a disordered quantum spin chain which hosts a
disorder-driven many-body localisation transition. Real-time
dynamics/probability transport is shown to exhibit a rich phenomenology, which
is markedly different between the ergodic and many-body localised phases. The
dynamics is for example found to be strongly inhomogeneous at intermediate
times in both phases, but while it gives way to homogeneity at long times in
the ergodic phase, the dynamics remain inhomogeneous and multifractal in nature
for arbitrarily long times in the localised phase. Similarly, we show that an
appropriately defined dynamical lengthscale on the Fock-space graph is directly

networks, Deep Learning has led to several breakthroughs surpassing human
performance. As a result, data movement for these millions of model parameters
causes a growing imbalance known as the memory wall. Neuromorphic computing is
an emerging paradigm that confronts this imbalance by performing computations
directly in analog memories. On the software side, the sequential
Backpropagation algorithm prevents efficient parallelization and thus fast
convergence. A novel method, Direct Feedback Alignment, resolves inherent layer
dependencies by directly passing the error from the output to each layer. At
the intersection of hardware/software co-design, there is a demand for
developing algorithms that are tolerable to hardware nonidealities. Therefore,
this work explores the interrelationship of implementing bio-plausible learning
in-situ on neuromorphic hardware, emphasizing energy, area, and latency
constraints. Using the benchmarking framework DNN+NeuroSim, we investigate the
impact of hardware nonidealities and quantization on algorithm performance, as
well as how network topologies and algorithm-level design choices can scale
latency, energy and area consumption of a chip. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to compare the impact of different learning algorithms
on Compute-In-Memory-based hardware and vice versa. The best results achieved
for accuracy remain Backpropagation-based, notably when facing hardware
imperfections. Direct Feedback Alignment, on the other hand, allows for
significant speedup due to parallelization, reducing training time by a factor
approaching N for N-layered networks.

layer stacking configuration to create highly tunable interlayer excitons with
static out-of-plane electric dipoles, at the expense of the strength of the
oscillating in-plane dipole responsible for light-matter coupling. Here we show
that interlayer excitons in bi- and tri-layer 2H-MoSe$_2$ crystals exhibit
electric-field-driven coupling with the ground ($1s$) and excited states ($2s$)
of the intralayer A excitons. We demonstrate that the hybrid states of these
distinct exciton species provide strong oscillator strength, large permanent
dipoles (up to $0.73 \pm 0.01$ enm), high energy tunability (up to $\sim$ 200

exciton g-factor can be manipulated over a large range (from -4 to +14).
Further, we observe the bi- and tri-layer excited state ($2s$) interlayer
excitons and their coupling with the intralayer excitons states ($1s$ and
$2s$). Our results, in good agreement with a coupled oscillator model with spin

by the authors [arXiv:2207.01921]. In the present work phonons are included
diagrammatically within the Migdal approximation by also including
self-consistency from the electronic feedback. The nonequilibrium steady-state
is addressed by means of the dynamical mean-field theory based on the
nonequilibrium Green's function approach, while the so-called auxiliary master
equation approach is employed as impurity solver. With optical phonons the
self-consistency suppresses the steady-state current at the onset of the
metallic phase with respect to the nonself-consistent case. This is due to the
interaction of phonons with the hot electrons of the lattice which increases
their temperature, thus providing a less effective relaxation channel for the
current-induced Joule heat. In addition, in the case of optical phonons the
results are essentially independent of the temperature of the fermionic baths,
as the latter is sensibly smaller than their characteristic frequency. On the
other hand, with acoustic phonons the steady-state current is slightly
suppressed by the self-consistent treatment only at field strengths close to
half of the gap, away from the metallic phase, and especially at very small
phonon frequency. Also, in this case the results seem to slightly depend on the
temperature of the fermionic baths.

measure using commercial instruments. Traditional methods for air quality
measurement often rely on calibrating the measurement with public standard
instruments or calculating the measurements moving average over a constant
period. However, this can lead to an incorrect index at the measurement
location, as well as an oversmoothing effect on the signal. In this study, we
propose a compact device that uses sheaf theory to detect and count vehicles as

limited by the lack of sufficient experimental data to train an accurate model

SESNet, a supervised deep-learning model to predict the fitness for protein
mutants by leveraging both sequence and structure information, and exploiting
attention mechanism. Our model integrates local evolutionary context from
homologous sequences, the global evolutionary context encoding rich semantic
from the universal protein sequence space and the structure information
accounting for the microenvironment around each residue in a protein. We show
that SESNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for predicting the
sequence-function relationship on 26 deep mutational scanning datasets. More
importantly, we propose a data augmentation strategy by leveraging the data
from unsupervised models to pre-train our model. After that, our model can
achieve strikingly high accuracy in prediction of the fitness of protein
mutants, especially for the higher order variants (> 4 mutation sites), when
finetuned by using only a small number of experimental mutation data (<50). The
strategy proposed is of great practical value as the required experimental
effort, i.e., producing a few tens of experimental mutation data on a given

applied on almost any protein.

designing an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the

of recovering not only the ground truth, but also the most confusing answer and
the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful
information about the task by revealing the most plausible answer other than
the ground truth and how plausible it is. To theoretically analyze such
scenarios, we propose a model in which there are the top two plausible answers
for each task, distinguished from the rest of the choices. Task difficulty is
quantified by the probability of confusion between the top two, and worker
reliability is quantified by the probability of giving an answer among the top
two. Under this model, we propose a two-stage inference algorithm to infer both
the top two answers and the confusion probability. We show that our algorithm
achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate. We conduct both synthetic and

development of the multi-microgrid (MMG), which raises the need of developing
an effective energy management method to minimize economic costs and keep self
energy-sufficiency. The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has
been widely used for the energy management problem because of its real-time
scheduling ability. However, its training requires massive energy operation
data of microgrids (MGs), while gathering these data from different MGs would
threaten their privacy and data security. Therefore, this paper tackles this
practical yet challenging issue by proposing a federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (F-MADRL) algorithm via the physics-informed reward. In
this algorithm, the federated learning (FL) mechanism is introduced to train
the F-MADRL algorithm thus ensures the privacy and the security of data. In
addition, a decentralized MMG model is built, and the energy of each
participated MG is managed by an agent, which aims to minimize economic costs
and keep self energy-sufficiency according to the physics-informed reward. At
first, MGs individually execute the self-training based on local energy
operation data to train their local agent models. Then, these local models are
periodically uploaded to a server and their parameters are aggregated to build
a global agent, which will be broadcasted to MGs and replace their local
agents. In this way, the experience of each MG agent can be shared and the
energy operation data is not explicitly transmitted, thus protecting the
privacy and ensuring data security. Finally, experiments are conducted on Oak
Ridge national laboratory distributed energy control communication lab
microgrid (ORNL-MG) test system, and the comparisons are carried out to verify
the effectiveness of introducing the FL mechanism and the outperformance of our
proposed F-MADRL.

immense interest to enable the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in
resource-constrained edge environments. Although these techniques have shown
promising results in reducing the energy, latency and memory requirements of
the DNNs, their performance in non-ideal real-world settings (such as in the
presence of hardware faults) is yet to be completely understood. In this paper,
we investigate the impact of bit-flip and stuck-at faults on activation-sparse
quantized DNNs (QDNNs). We show that a high level of activation sparsity comes
at the cost of larger vulnerability to faults. For instance, activation-sparse
QDNNs exhibit up to 17.32% lower accuracy than the standard QDNNs. We also
establish that one of the major cause of the degraded accuracy is sharper
minima in the loss landscape for activation-sparse QDNNs, which makes them more
sensitive to perturbations in the weight values due to faults. Based on this
observation, we propose the mitigation of the impact of faults by employing a
sharpness-aware quantization (SAQ) training scheme. The activation-sparse and
standard QDNNs trained with SAQ have up to 36.71% and 24.76% higher inference
accuracy, respectively compared to their conventionally trained equivalents.
Moreover, we show that SAQ-trained activation-sparse QDNNs show better accuracy
in faulty settings than standard QDNNs trained conventionally. Thus the
proposed technique can be instrumental in achieving sparsity-related
energy/latency benefits without compromising on fault tolerance.

variety of situations such as navigation. However, training neural
network-based agents requires numerous paired trajectories and languages. This
paper proposes using multimodal generative models for semi-supervised learning
in the instruction following tasks. The models learn a shared representation of
the paired data, and enable semi-supervised learning by reconstructing unpaired
data through the representation. Key challenges in applying the models to
sequence-to-sequence tasks including instruction following are learning a
shared representation of variable-length mulitimodal data and incorporating
attention mechanisms. To address the problems, this paper proposes a novel
network architecture to absorb the difference in the sequence lengths of the
multimodal data. In addition, to further improve the performance, this paper
shows how to incorporate the generative model-based approach with an existing
semi-supervised method called a speaker-follower model, and proposes a
regularization term that improves inference using unpaired trajectories.
Experiments on BabyAI and Room-to-Room (R2R) environments show that the
proposed method improves the performance of instruction following by leveraging
unpaired data, and improves the performance of the speaker-follower model by
2\% to 4\% in R2R.

using a universal framework of energy flux. In a turbulent flow with dilute
polymers and magnetic field, the kinetic energy injected at large scales
cascades to the velocity field at intermediate scales, as well as to the
polymers and magnetic field at all scales. Consequently, the kinetic energy
flux, $ \Pi_u(k) $, is suppressed in comparison to the pure hydrodynamic
turbulence. We argue that the suppression of $\Pi_u(k)$ is an important factor
in the reduction of the inertial force $\langle {\bf u \cdot \nabla u} \rangle$
and \textit{turbulent drag}. This feature of turbulent drag reduction is
observed in polymeric, magnetohydrodynamic, quasi-static magnetohydrodynamic,
and stably-stratified turbulence, and in dynamos. In addition, it is shown that
turbulent drag reduction in thermal convection is due to the smooth thermal
plates, similar to the turbulent drag reduction over bluff bodies. In all these
flows, turbulent drag reduction often leads to a strong large-scale velocity in
the flow.

understanding the physical world, but their advantages and limitations are not
fully understood. Some QNNs with specific encoding methods can be efficiently
simulated by classical surrogates, while others with quantum memory may perform
better than classical classifiers. Here we systematically investigate the
problem-dependent power of quantum neural classifiers (QCs) on multi-class
classification tasks. Through the analysis of expected risk, a measure that
weighs the training loss and the generalization error of a classifier jointly,
we identify two key findings: first, the training loss dominates the power
rather than the generalization ability; second, QCs undergo a U-shaped risk
curve, in contrast to the double-descent risk curve of deep neural classifiers.
We also reveal the intrinsic connection between optimal QCs and the Helstrom
bound and the equiangular tight frame. Using these findings, we propose a
method that uses loss dynamics to probe whether a QC may be more effective than
a classical classifier on a particular learning task. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to explain the superiority of QCs
over multilayer Perceptron on parity datasets and their limitations over
convolutional neural networks on image datasets. Our work sheds light on the
problem-dependent power of QNNs and offers a practical tool for evaluating

  Spiking Policy Network",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning from the interaction is the primary way biological agents know about
the environment and themselves. Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
explores a computational approach to learning from interaction and has
significantly progressed in solving various tasks. However, the powerful DRL is
still far from biological agents in energy efficiency. Although the underlying
mechanisms are not fully understood, we believe that the integration of spiking
communication between neurons and biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity
plays a prominent role. Following this biological intuition, we optimize a
spiking policy network (SPN) by a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficient
alternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insects
and communicates through event-based spikes. Inspired by biological research
that the brain forms memories by forming new synaptic connections and rewires
these connections based on new experiences, we tune the synaptic connections
instead of weights in SPN to solve given tasks. Experimental results on several
robotic control tasks show that our method can achieve the performance level of
mainstream DRL methods and exhibit significantly higher energy efficiency.

  atmospheric advection simulation","Accepted version of paper appearing in the 2023 ACM/SIGDA
  International Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA '23),
  February 12--14, 2023, Monterey, CA, US",,"10.1145/3543622.3573047",,"cs.DC cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AMD Xilinx's new Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) is an
FPGA architecture combining reconfigurable fabric with other on-chip hardened
compute resources. AI engines are one of these and, by operating in a highly
vectorized manner, they provide significant raw compute that is potentially
beneficial for a range of workloads including HPC simulation. However, this
technology is still early-on, and as yet unproven for accelerating HPC codes,
with a lack of benchmarking and best practice.
  This paper presents an experience report, exploring porting of the Piacsek
and Williams (PW) advection scheme onto the Versal ACAP, using the chip's AI
engines to accelerate the compute. A stencil-based algorithm, advection is
commonplace in atmospheric modelling, including several Met Office codes who
initially developed this scheme. Using this algorithm as a vehicle, we explore
optimal approaches for structuring AI engine compute kernels and how best to
interface the AI engines with programmable logic. Evaluating performance using
a VCK5000 against non-AI engine FPGA configurations on the VCK5000 and Alveo
U280, as well as a 24-core Xeon Platinum Cascade Lake CPU and Nvidia V100 GPU,
we found that whilst the number of channels between the fabric and AI engines
are a limitation, by leveraging the ACAP we can double performance compared to
an Alveo U280.

  https://github.com/mjhwright/error-correction",,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We motivate the use of neural networks for the construction of numerical
solutions to differential equations. We prove that there exists a feed-forward
neural network that can arbitrarily minimise an objective function that is zero
at the solution of Poisson's equation, allowing us to guarantee that neural
network solution estimates can get arbitrarily close to the exact solutions. We
also show how these estimates can be appreciably enhanced through various
strategies, in particular through the construction of error correction
networks, for which we propose a general method. We conclude by providing
numerical experiments that attest to the validity of all such strategies for
variants of Poisson's equation.

modalities are used for recognizing activities. Temporal modeling is a long
challenge of action recognition. However, there are limited methods such as
pre-computed motion features, three-dimensional (3D) filters, and recurrent
neural networks (RNN) for modeling motion information in deep-based approaches.
Recently, transformers success in modeling long-range dependencies in natural
language processing (NLP) tasks has gotten great attention from other domains;
including speech, image, and video, to rely entirely on self-attention without
using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolutions. Although the application of
transformers to action recognition is relatively new, the amount of research
proposed on this topic within the last few years is astounding. This paper
especially reviews recent progress in deep learning methods for modeling
temporal variations. It focuses on action recognition methods that use
transformers for temporal modeling, discussing their main features, used
modalities, and identifying opportunities and challenges for future research.
