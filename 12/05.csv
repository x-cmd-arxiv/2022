is still one of the major research challenges in RL. RL is a machine-learning
approach to determine near-optimal policies in Markov decision processes
(MDPs). In this paper, we consider the setting where the safety-relevant
fragment of the MDP together with a temporal logic safety specification is
given and many safety violations can be avoided by planning ahead a short time
into the future. We propose an approach for online safety shielding of RL
agents. During runtime, the shield analyses the safety of each available
action. For any action, the shield computes the maximal probability to not
violate the safety specification within the next $k$ steps when executing this
action. Based on this probability and a given threshold, the shield decides
whether to block an action from the agent. Existing offline shielding
approaches compute exhaustively the safety of all state-action combinations
ahead of time, resulting in huge computation times and large memory
consumption. The intuition behind online shielding is to compute at runtime the
set of all states that could be reached in the near future. For each of these
states, the safety of all available actions is analysed and used for shielding
as soon as one of the considered states is reached. Our approach is well suited
for high-level planning problems where the time between decisions can be used
for safety computations and it is sustainable for the agent to wait until these
computations are finished. For our evaluation, we selected a 2-player version
of the classical computer game SNAKE. The game represents a high-level planning
problem that requires fast decisions and the multiplayer setting induces a
large state space, which is computationally expensive to analyse exhaustively.

systematically the system dynamics and steady-state by solving quantum master

spins and pentacene molecular spins the superradiant Rabi oscillations occur
firstly due to transitions among different Dicke states, and the subsequent

are grouped into a certain number of known classes, novelty detection methods
aim to classify the instances of an unlabeled test set while allowing for the
presence of previously unseen classes. These models are valuable in many areas,
ranging from social network and food adulteration analyses to biology, where an
evolving population may be present. In this paper, we focus on a two-stage
Bayesian semiparametric novelty detector, also known as Brand, recently
introduced in the literature. Leveraging on a model-based mixture
representation, Brand allows clustering the test observations into known
training terms or a single novelty term. Furthermore, the novelty term is
modeled with a Dirichlet Process mixture model to flexibly capture any
departure from the known patterns. Brand was originally estimated using MCMC
schemes, which are prohibitively costly when applied to high-dimensional data.
To scale up Brand applicability to large datasets, we propose to resort to a
variational Bayes approach, providing an efficient algorithm for posterior
approximation. We demonstrate a significant gain in efficiency and excellent
classification performance with thorough simulation studies. Finally, to
showcase its applicability, we perform a novelty detection analysis using the
openly-available Statlog dataset, a large collection of satellite imaging

diffraction-limited storage ring designs, which can permit relatively large
on-momentum dynamic aperture and relatively weak sextupoles. In a typical HMBA
lattice, the main arc section is constrained by the transverse phase advances
making -I transformation for sextupole cancellation. In this paper, a new HMBA
lattice concept with sextupole cancellation across straight section is
proposed, where -I is made between adjacent dispersion bumps of two lattice
cells. This makes the main arc section free of the phase advance constraint,
and as a result, the number of bending magnets (bends) in the lattice cell and
the cell tunes can be easily changed, thus providing more choices for lattice
design. To achieve the large phase advances required for -I in this new
concept, split bend is used as the matching bend, which is a bend split into
two pieces with a quadrupole in between. The split bend also serves to reduce
the emittance, and the large phase advances also give low beta functions in the
straight section enhancing the insertion device brightness. Besides, for a
given emittance goal, this new HMBA lattice can have less bends than the
typical HMBA lattice due to stronger focusing in bend unit cells, which is
beneficial for saving space and suppressing intra-beam scattering effect. Two
lattices are given as examples to demonstrate this new concept and show its
linear and nonlinear properties, and further extension is also discussed.

  As an application, we answer affirmatively a long-term open question that
Lagrangian spherical Dehn twists generate the symplectic Torelli group
$Symp_h(X)$ when $X$ is a positive rational surface. We also prove that all

considered in the case when Y=H(X) is the space of non-empty compact subsets of
a finite-dimensional normed space X endowed with the Hausdorff metric, i.e.
H(X) is a hyperspace over X. The set A is called boundary, all A_i are called
boundary sets, and the compact sets that realize the minimum of the sum of
distances to A_i are called Steiner compacts. In this paper, we study the
question of stability in the Fermat--Steiner problem when passing from a
boundary consisting of finite compact sets to a boundary consisting of their
convex hulls. By stability here we mean that the minimum of the sum of
distances does not change when passing to convex hulls of boundary compact
sets. The paper continued the study of geometric objects, namely, hook sets
that arise in the Fermat--Steiner problem. The results obtained revealed some
geometry of the relationship between Steiner compacts and boundary sets. On its
basis, a sufficient condition for the instability of the boundary in H(X) was
derived.

open challenge in music information retrieval to reliably detect the notes of
the melody present in an arbitrary music recording. A key challenge in melody
transcription is building methods which can handle broad audio containing any
number of instrument ensembles and musical styles - existing strategies work
well for some melody instruments or styles but not all. To confront this
challenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a
generative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody
transcription by $20$% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another
obstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data - we derive a new
dataset containing $50$ hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced
annotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a
new dataset for this task results in $77$% stronger performance on melody
transcription relative to the strongest available baseline. By pairing our new
melody transcription approach with solutions for beat detection, key
estimation, and chord recognition, we build Sheet Sage, a system capable of
transcribing human-readable lead sheets directly from music audio.

10^{-10}{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ agree with observational data, but beyond that upper
limit, we did not find stellar models compatible with the observational

{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ on, the algorithm did not find any fitting model. Nevertheless,
all axionic models considered, presented a distinct internal profile from the
reference case, without axions. Moreover, as axion energy losses become more
significant, the behaviour of the stellar models becomes more diversified, even
with very similar input parameters. Nonetheless, the consecutive increments of
$g_{a \gamma}$ still show systematic tendencies, resulting from the axion
energy losses. Moreover, we establish three important conclusions: (1) The
increased luminosity and higher neutrino production are measurable effects,
possibly associated with axion energy losses. (2) Stellar models with axion
energy loss show a quite distinct internal structure. (3) The importance of
future asteroseismic missions in observing low-degree non-radial modes in
massive stars:internal gravity waves probe the near-core regions, where axion
effects are most intense. Thus, more seismic data will allow us to constrain
$g_{a\gamma}$ better and prove or dismiss the existence of axion energy loss

regolith simulant under high vacuum conditions (~10-6 Torr) using both 2-phase

removal at moderate voltages (1000 V) for both 2-phase and 3-phase designs, but
the performance of the devices degraded after several sequential tests due to
erosion of the traces caused by electric discharges. Further tests carried out
while illuminating the dust surface with a UV excimer lamp showed that the EDS
voltage needed to reach the maximum cleanliness was reduced by almost 50% for
the 2-phase devices (500 V minimum for rough and 1000 V for smooth), while the
3-phase devices were unaffected by the application of UV. Capping the CMrGO
traces with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) eliminated breakdown of the
materials and device degradation, but larger voltages (3000 V) coupled with UV
illumination were required to remove the grains from the capped devices.

practice, this restricts the capability to fully leverage unlabeled data from

of these pre-trained networks is constrained to downstream tasks with
compatible data dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for
unsupervised joint learning on 2D and 3D data modalities. Given a set of 2D

on a 2D contrastive clustering problem for distinct classes. The 3D volumes are
exploited by computing vectored embedding at each slice and then assembling a
holistic feature through deformable self-attention mechanisms in Transformer,
allowing incorporating long-range dependencies between slices inside 3D
volumes. These holistic features are further utilized to define a novel 3D
clustering agreement-based SSL task and masking embedding prediction inspired
by pre-trained language models. Experiments on downstream tasks, such as 3D

structured proteins. The proteins' structure has a direct impact on their
biological function. However, nearly half of the proteome is composed of
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein regions that fluctuate
between ensembles of numerous conformations. Therefore, to understand their
biological function, it is critical to depict how the structural ensemble
statistics correlate to the IDPs' amino acid sequence. Here, using small-angle
x-ray scattering (SAXS) and time-resolved F\""orster resonance energy transfer
(trFRET), we study the intra-molecular structural heterogeneity of the
neurofilament low intrinsically disordered tail domain (NFLt). Using
theoretical analogs of polymer physics, we find that the Flory scaling exponent
of NFLt sub-segments correlates linearly with their net charge, ranging from
statistics of ideal to self-avoiding chains. Further analysis reveals specific
structural elements arising from di-proline bending and transient loop
formation. Surprisingly, measuring the same segments in the context of the
whole NFLt protein we find that regardless of the peptide sequence the
segments' structural statistics are more expanded than when measured
independently. Our findings show that while polymer physics can, to some level,
relate the IDP's sequence to its ensemble conformations, long-range contacts
between distant amino acids play a crucial role in determining intra-molecular
structures. This emphasizes the necessity of advanced polymer theories to fully
describe IDPs ensembles with the hope it will allow us to model their
biological function.

framework to meet the dynamic demands of future applications. The frequent
variations in a cloud user's resource demand lead 'to the problem of excess
power consumption, resource wastage, performance, and Quality-of-Service
degradation. The proposed framework addresses these challenges by matching the
application's predicted resource requirement with the resource capacity of VMs
precisely and thereby consolidating the entire load on the minimum number of
energy-efficient physical machines. The three consecutive contributions of the
proposed work are: Online Multi-Resource Feed-forward Neural Network to
forecast the multiple resource demands concurrently for future applications;
autoscaling of VMs based on the clustering of the predicted resource
requirements; allocation of the scaled VMs on the energy-efficient PMs. The
integrated approach successively optimizes resource utilization, saves energy
and automatically adapts to the changes in future application resource demand.
The proposed framework is evaluated by using real workload traces of the
benchmark Google Cluster Dataset and compared against different scenarios
including energy-efficient VM placement with resource prediction only, VMP
without resource prediction and autoscaling, and optimal VMP with autoscaling
based on actual resource utilization. The observed results demonstrate that the
proposed integrated approach achieves near-optimal performance against optimal
VMP and outperforms rest of the VMPs in terms of power saving and resource
utilization up to 88.5% and 21.12% respectively. In addition, the OM-FNN
predictor shows better accuracy, lesser time and space complexity over a

minimizer problem is to find a connected compact set $\Sigma$ of the minimal
length, such that \[ \max_{y \in M} dist (y, \Sigma) \leq r. \] The inverse
problem is to determine whether a given compact connected set $\Sigma$ is a
minimizer for some compact $M$ and some positive $r$.
  Let a Steiner tree $St$ with $n$ terminals be unique for its terminal
vertices. The first result of the paper is that $St$ is a minimizer for a set
$M$ of $n$ points and a small enough positive $r$. It is known that in the
planar case a general Steiner tree (on a finite number of terminals) is unique.
It is worth noting that a Steiner tree on $n$ terminal vertices can be not a
minimizer for any $n$ point set $M$ starting with $n = 4$; the simplest such
example is a Steiner tree for the vertices of a square.
  Recall that a planar maximal distance minimizer is a finite union of simple
curves. The second result is an example of a minimizer with an infinite number
of corner points (points with two tangent rays which do not belong to the same
line), which means that this minimizer can not be represented as a finite union
of smooth curves.
  We also show that every injective $C^{1,1}$-curve $\Sigma$ is a minimizer for
a small enough $r>0$ and $M = \overline{B_r(\Sigma)}$ (this follows from the
proof of analogues result by Tilli on average distance minimizers).

this work, we take a closer look at such third-party applications from a less
pessimistic angle: we consider their potential to provide personalized and
secure capabilities and investigate measures to authenticate users (``PIN'',
``Voice authentication'', ``Notification'', and presence of ``Nearby

categories and 51 apps with a wide range of functions. The central questions we
explored focused on: users' preferences for security and personalization for
different categories of apps; the preferred security and personalization
measures for different apps; and the preferred frequency of the respective
measure.
  After an initial pilot study, we focused primarily on 7 categories of apps
for which security and personalization are reported to be important; those
include the three crucial categories finance, bills, and shopping. We found
that ``Voice authentication'', while not currently employed by the apps we
studied, is a highly popular measure to achieve security and personalization.
Many participants were open to exploring combinations of security measures to
increase the protection of highly relevant apps. Here, the combination of
``PIN'' and ``Voice authentication'' was clearly the most desired one. This
finding indicates systems that seamlessly combine ``Voice authentication'' with
other measures might be a good candidate for future work.

proposed that study operational and power quality constraints with local energy
markets independently. This paper proposes a convex optimization model of an
energy management system with operational and power quality constraints and
interactions in a Local Energy Market (LEM) for unbalanced microgrids (MGs).
The LEM consists of a pre-dispatch step and an energy transactions step (ETS).
The ETS combines the MGs' objectives while considering two strategies: minimize
the cost of buyers or maximize the revenue of sellers. Our proposed model
considers harmonic distortion and voltage limit power quality constraints in
both steps. Moreover, we model operational constraints such as power flow,
power balance, and distributed energy resources behaviors and capacities. We
numerically evaluate the proposed model using three unbalanced MGs with
residential, industrial, and commercial load profiles, where each microgrid
manages its resources locally. Furthermore, we create two groups of cases to
analyze the interactions in the local energy market. In the first group, the
price of the DSO energy and the surplus from MGs to DSO are the same. The
numerical results show that using the increasing revenue strategy promotes MGs
to interact more while encouraging them to have high energy prices. When the
reducing cost strategy is used, fewer energy interactions occur, and the price
of MGs energy is encouraged to be lower.

represented as a field theoretic model, which is shown to be multiplicatively
renormalizable. The corresponding renormalization group equations possess a
semi-infinite curve of fixed points in the four-dimensional space of the model
parameters. The whole curve is infrared attractive for realistic values of
parameters; its endpoint corresponds to the purely isotropic regime where the
original Hwa-Kardar nonlinearity becomes irrelevant. There, one is left with a
simple advection of a passive scalar field by the external environment. The
main critical dimensions are calculated to the leading one-loop order (first
terms in the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion); some of them are appear to be exact
in all orders. They remain the same along that curve, which makes it reasonable
to interpret it as a single universality class. However, the correction
exponents do vary along the curve. It is therefore not clear whether the curve
survives in all orders of the renormalization group expansion or shrinks to a
single point when the higher-order corrections are taken into account.

the difference among the codes on the SFR-stellar mass relation and we measure

attenuation (~0.3mag). Finally, we present some resources summarizing best

galaxies,including the dust opacity and shape of the attenuation curve in both
optical and NUV, as well as the strength of the 2175{\AA} absorption feature.
From an observed spectrum the method uses a model-independent approach to
derive a relative attenuation curve.The absolute amplitude is then calibrated
with the NIR photometry. The dust-corrected spectrum is fitted with stellar
population models to derive the dust-free model spectrum covering the whole
wavelength range from NUV to NIR and is compared with the observed SED/spectrum
to determine dust attenuation properties. We apply this method to investigate
dust attenuation on kpc scales, using a sample of 134 galaxies with the
integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA, the NIR imaging from 2MASS, and the NUV
imaging from Swift/UVOT. We find that the attenuation curves in regions of kpc
scales span a wide range of slopes in both optical and UV. The slope is
shallower at higher optical opacity, a trend that is held even when the sample
is limited to narrow ranges of specific star formation rate (sSFR),
minor-to-major axis ratio (b/a) and the location within individual galaxies.
The 2175{\AA} bump in the attenuation curve at kpc scales presents a wide range
of strength. The strength shows a strong negative correlation with the sSFR,
but the correlations with the optical opacity, $b/a$ and the location within
individual galaxies are all weak. All these trends appear to be independent of
the stellar mass of galaxies, implying that the dust attenuation is regulated
by local processes rather than by global properties of galaxies. Our results
support the scenario that the variation of the 2175{\AA} bump is driven
predominantly by processes related to star formation, such as destruction of
small dust grains by UV radiation in star-forming regions.

that solving a regression problem with a set of binary classifiers can improve

introduce binary-encoded labels (BEL), which generalizes the application of
binary classification to regression by providing a framework for considering
arbitrary multi-bit values when encoding target values. We identify desirable
properties of suitable encoding and decoding functions used for the conversion

error probability and error-correction capabilities of label encodings. BEL can
be combined with off-the-shelf task-specific feature extractors and trained

leverages either time or frequency diversity or both to reduce interference and
signal loss owing to channel impairments and facilitate the efficient operation
of large-scale dense Internet-of-Things (IoT). Our approach employs dispersion
of data-streams transmitted from individual IoT devices over indexed space-time
(ST), space-frequency (SF) or space-time-frequency (STF) blocks. As a result,
no two devices transmit on the same block; only one is activated while the rest
of the devices in the network is silent, thereby minimizing possibility of
interference on the transmit side. On the receive side, multiple-antenna array
ameliorates performance in presence of channel impairments while exploiting
array-processing gain. As interference due to superposition of multiple
data-streams is killed at its root, no extra energy is wasted in fighting
interference and other impairments, thereby enabling energy-efficient
transmission from multiple devices over multiple access channel (MAC). To
validate the proposed concept, we simulate the performance of the framework
against dense IoT networks deployed in generalized indoor and outdoor scenarios
in terms of probability of signal outage. Results demonstrate that our
conceptualized framework benefits from interference-free transmission as well

collapse in effective dynamics, the singularity is resolved and replaced by a
bounce. Though quantum geometric modification from spatial curvature is not
directly included in the K-quantization it does affect the qualitative dynamics
of the collapsing dust cloud in the sense that on the one hand for the
marginally bound case, the dust cloud bounces once at fixed maximum energy
density and on the other hand for the bound case, the dust cloud undergoes
infinite cycles of contraction and expansion at energy densities dependent on
the dust mass. Finally, the mass threshold for the formation of a trapped
surface in each case is found and the matching conditions between the interior
collapsing spacetime and an effective exterior static solution are discussed.

obtaining the high-level task knowledge required to build such automata is

automatically generate relevant task knowledge. However, the textual outputs
from GLMs cannot be formally verified or used for sequential decision-making.
We propose a novel algorithm named GLM2FSA, which constructs a finite state
automaton (FSA) encoding high-level task knowledge from a brief
natural-language description of the task goal. GLM2FSA first sends queries to a
GLM to extract task knowledge in textual form, and then it builds an FSA to
represent this text-based knowledge. The proposed algorithm thus fills the gap
between natural-language task descriptions and automaton-based representations,
and the constructed FSA can be formally verified against user-defined
specifications. We accordingly propose a method to iteratively refine the
queries to the GLM based on the outcomes, e.g., counter-examples, from
verification. We demonstrate GLM2FSA's ability to build and refine
automaton-based representations of everyday tasks (e.g., crossing a road), and

and is used to protect a laser from unwanted reflections for phase-stable
coherent operation. The development of chip-scale optical systems, powered by
semiconductor lasers integrated on the same chip, has resulted in a need for a
fully integrated optical isolator. However, conventional approaches based on
application of magneto-optic materials to break the reciprocity and provide
required isolation have significant challenges in terms of material processing
and insertion loss. As a result, many magnetic-free approaches have been
explored, including acousto-optics, optical nonlinearity, and electro-optics.
However, to date, the realization of an integrated isolator with low insertion
loss, high isolation ratio, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption on a
monolithic material platform is still absent. Here we realize non-reciprocal
traveling-wave EO-based isolator on thin-film LN, enabling maximum optical
isolation of 48 dB and an on-chip insertion loss of 0.5 dB using a
single-frequency microwave drive at 21-dBm RF power. The isolation ratio is
verified to be larger than 37 dB across a tunable optical wavelength range from
1510 to 1630 nm. We verify that our hybrid DFB laser - LN isolator module
successfully protects the single-mode operation and the linewidth of the DFB
laser from reflection. Our result is a significant step towards a practical
high-performance optical isolator on chip.

zeta zeros and prime powers.
  We use this correction term to discover a lower order term in the asymptotics
of $\Psi(x,y)/\Lambda(x,y)$. The term relates directly to the error term in the
prime number theorem, and implies that large positive (resp. negative) values
of $\sum_{n \le y} \Lambda(n)-y$ lead to large positive (resp. negative) values
of $\Psi(x,y)-\Lambda(x,y)$, and vice versa. This holds for $y$ as small as

transition patterns from historical location visits, their visit time and
activity duration, as well as their surrounding land use functions, to infer an
individual's next location. Specifically, we adopt point-of-interest data and
latent Dirichlet allocation for representing locations' land use contexts at
multiple spatial scales, generate embedding vectors of the spatio-temporal

experiments on two large-scale GNSS tracking datasets, we demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction models, and reveal
the contribution of various spatio-temporal contexts to the model's
performance. Moreover, we find that the model trained on population data
achieves higher prediction performance with fewer parameters than
individual-level models due to learning from collective movement patterns. We
also reveal mobility conducted in the recent past and one week before has the
largest influence on the current prediction, showing that learning from a

obtain the most useful labels for training while keeping the total number of

framework proposes to use centrality score, density score, and entropy score to
evaluate the value of unlabeled nodes, and it has been shown to be capable of
bringing some improvement to the node classification tasks of Graph
Convolutional Networks. However, when evaluating the importance of unlabeled
nodes, it fails to consider the influence of existing labeled nodes on the
value of unlabeled nodes. In other words, given the same unlabeled node, the
computed informative score is always the same and is agnostic to the labeled
node set. With the aim to address this limitation, in this work, we introduce 3
dissimilarity-based information scores for active learning: feature
dissimilarity score (FDS), structure dissimilarity score (SDS), and embedding
dissimilarity score (EDS). We find out that those three scores are able to take
the influence of the labeled set on the value of unlabeled candidates into
consideration, boosting our AL performance. According to experiments, our newly
proposed scores boost the classification accuracy by 2.1% on average and are

release rates and hole shapes on the failure process of fibre-reinforced

under the background of the finite element method, and the influence of strong
and weak interfaces on the failure strength of composite materials is studied.
The results show that when the material fails, the strong interface shows
brittleness, and the weak interface shows toughness, which can improve the
failure strength of the material. At the same time, the effective critical
energy release rate is introduced in the calculation, which reduces the
fracture toughness of the material, makes the prediction results more
consistent with the experimental results, and improves the accuracy of the
results. The effect of hole shapes on the failure of the composites is also
explored, and the crack propagation of different hole shapes is captured, which
shows that the bearing capacity of a plate with a hole is not only related to
the shape of the hole but also related to the location of the hole concentrated
stress and the number of locations where the hole bears the load. The bearing
capacity of the material can be improved by changing the shape of the hole.
These results reveal the influence of different factors on the failure of

computing-constrained participating devices with confidential local data. To
alleviate biased pruning due to unseen heterogeneous data over devices, FedTiny
introduces an adaptive batch normalization (BN) selection module to adaptively
obtain an initially pruned model to fit deployment scenarios. Besides, to
further improve the initial pruning, FedTiny develops a lightweight progressive
pruning module for local finer pruning under tight memory and computational
budgets, where the pruning policy for each layer is gradually determined rather
than evaluating the overall deep model structure. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTiny, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline approaches, especially when compressing deep models

preserving background and styles of the original text. However, due to the
complicated background textures and various text styles, existing methods fall
short in generating clear and legible edited text images. In this study, we
attribute the poor editing performance to two problems: 1) Implicit decoupling
structure. Previous methods of editing the whole image have to learn different
translation rules of background and text regions simultaneously. 2) Domain gap.
Due to the lack of edited real scene text images, the network can only be well
trained on synthetic pairs and performs poorly on real-world images. To handle
the above problems, we propose a novel network by MOdifying Scene Text image at
strokE Level (MOSTEL). Firstly, we generate stroke guidance maps to explicitly
indicate regions to be edited. Different from the implicit one by directly
modifying all the pixels at image level, such explicit instructions filter out
the distractions from background and guide the network to focus on editing
rules of text regions. Secondly, we propose a Semi-supervised Hybrid Learning
to train the network with both labeled synthetic images and unpaired real scene
text images. Thus, the STE model is adapted to real-world datasets
distributions. Moreover, two new datasets (Tamper-Syn2k and Tamper-Scene) are
proposed to fill the blank of public evaluation datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our MOSTEL outperforms previous methods both qualitatively and
quantitatively. Datasets and code will be available at

leverage indirect correspondences obtained via semantic object identification.
For instance, when an object is seen from the front in one frame and from the
back in another frame, we can provide additional pose constraints through
canonical object correspondences. We first propose a neural network to predict
such correspondences on a per-pixel level, which we then combine in our energy
formulation with state-of-the-art keypoint matching solved with a joint
Gauss-Newton optimization. In a pairwise setting, our method improves
registration recall of state-of-the-art feature matching, including from 24% to
45% in pairs with 10% or less inter-frame overlap. In registering RGB-D

whether the coupling is positive or negative, the system displays metallic or
insulating behavior in its normal state. An essential property is the
appearance of a mid-IR peak in the alternating current (AC) conductivity in
certain parameters. The mid-IR peak originates from the competition between
explicit symmetry breaking (ESB) and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which
results in the pseudo-Goldstone mode. Moreover, a dip in low-frequency AC
conductivity might be noticed. Such a dip can be understood phenomenologically
as vortex-like behavior, which can be attributed to the SSB Goldstone mode's
excitation. In the superconducting phase, the effect on the condensation or
superconducting energy gap from the gauge-axion coupling is amplified only in
strong momentum dissipation. In particular, a hard-gap-like behavior at low
frequency and a pronounced peak at intermediate frequency would be seen for the
case with negative gauge-axion coupling, showing that the evolution of the
superfluid component is distinct from that of positive coupling.

the crossings thus destroys DNLs, and so far the reported DNLs in a few
materials are non-interacting type, making the search for robust interacting
DNLs in real materials appealing. Here, via first-principle calculations, we
reveal that Kondo interaction together with nonsymmorphic lattice symmetries
can drive a robust interacting DNLs in a Kondo semimetal CePt_2Si_2, and the
feature of DNLs can be significantly manipulated by Kondo behavior in different
temperature regions. Based on the density function theory combining dynamical
mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), we predict a transition to Kondo-coherent state
at coherent temperature T_coh= 80 K upon cooling, verified by temperature
dependence of Ce-4f self-energy, Kondo resonance peak, magnetic susceptibility
and momentum-resolved spectral. Below T_coh, well-resolved narrow heavy-fermion
bands emerge near the Fermi level, constructing clearly visualized interacting
DNLs locating at the BZ boundary, in which the Dirac fermions have strongly
enhanced effective mass and reduced velocity. In contrast, above a crossover
temperature T_KS =600 K, the destruction of local Kondo screening drives
non-interacting DNLs which are comprised by light conduction electrons at the
same location. These DNLs are protected by lattice nonsymmorphic symmetries
thus robust under intrinsic strong SOC. Our proposal of DNLs which can be
significantly manipulated according to Kondo behavior provides an unique
realization of interacting Dirac semimetals in real strongly correlated

~1000 au and is relatively flat with a scale height of less than several
hundred au. The tilted ring, or the apparent ellipse, has a prominent velocity
difference between its NW and SE ridges along the minor axis, suggesting that
it is expanding in the equatorial plane at a velocity of 13.2 km/s. The ring

fed the O9 star, whose radiation or magnetic activities became so strong that
the disk accretion was reversed due to the intense thermal or

  Self-Distillation",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a privacy-preserving
distributed machine learning paradigm that enables knowledge sharing among
various heterogeneous artificial intelligence (AIoT) devices through
centralized global model aggregation. FL suffers from model inaccuracy and slow
convergence due to the model heterogeneity of the AIoT devices involved.
Although various existing methods try to solve the bottleneck of the model
heterogeneity problem, most of them improve the accuracy of heterogeneous
models in a coarse-grained manner, which makes it still a great challenge to
deploy large-scale AIoT devices. To alleviate the negative impact of this
problem and take full advantage of the diversity of each heterogeneous model,
we propose an efficient framework named HierarchyFL, which uses a small amount
of public data for efficient and scalable knowledge across a variety of
differently structured models. By using self-distillation and our proposed
ensemble library, each hierarchical model can intelligently learn from each
other on cloud servers. Experimental results on various well-known datasets
show that HierarchyFL can not only maximize the knowledge sharing among various
heterogeneous models in large-scale AIoT systems, but also greatly improve the
model performance of each involved heterogeneous AIoT device.

virtual and physical spaces into a mixed one, where physical entities coexist
and interact with virtual entities via their digital counterparts. Under the
framework of mixedDT, MCCT contains three major experimental platforms in the
physical, virtual and mixed spaces respectively, and provides a unified access
for various human-machine interfaces and external devices such as driving
simulators. A cloud unit, where the mixed experimental platform is deployed, is
responsible for fusing multi-platform information and assigning control
instructions, contributing to synchronous operation and real-time
cross-platform interaction. Particularly, MCCT allows for multi-vehicle
coordination composed of different multi-source vehicles (\eg, physical

chord-based Reynolds number of $400$ and a Mach number of $0.1$. Using direct

near the wing root with a quasi-steady tip vortex. For swept wings, vortex
shedding is seen near the wing tip for low sweep angles, while the wakes are
steady for wings with high sweep angles. To gain further insights into the
mechanisms of flow unsteadiness, triglobal resolvent analysis is used to
identify the optimal spatial input-output mode pairs and the associated gains

reveal that harmonic fluctuations are directed towards the root for unswept

interest in differentiating spoof speech from the natural speech is emerging in
the research community. The identification of these synthetic signals is a
difficult task not only for the cutting-edge classification models but also for
humans themselves. To prevent potential adverse effects, it becomes crucial to
detect spoof signals. From a forensics perspective, it is also important to
predict the algorithm which generated them to identify the forger. This needs
an understanding of the underlying attributes of spoof signals which serve as a
signature for the synthesizer. This study emphasizes the segments of speech
signals critical in identifying their authenticity by utilizing the Vocal Tract
System(\textit{VTS}) and Voice Source(\textit{VS}) features.
  In this paper, we propose a system that detects spoof signals as well as
identifies the corresponding speech-generating algorithm. We achieve 99.58\% in
algorithm classification accuracy. From experiments, we found that a VS
feature-based system gives more attention to the transition of phonemes, while,
a VTS feature-based system gives more attention to stationary segments of
speech signals. We perform model fusion techniques on the VS-based and
VTS-based systems to exploit the complementary information to develop a robust
classifier. Upon analyzing the confusion plots we found that WaveRNN is poorly
classified depicting more naturalness. On the other hand, we identified that
synthesizer like Waveform Concatenation, and Neural Source Filter is classified
with the highest accuracy. Practical implications of this work can aid

how to exploit and conduct the prosperous detection-then-segmentation paradigm

scans. Considering complicated shapes, sizes and orientations of anatomies,
without lose of generality, we present the nine degrees-of-freedom (9-DoF) pose
estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage,
non-hierarchical forward representation. Our whole framework is executed in a
steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to
further boost the inference efficiency. We have validated the proposed method
on three medical imaging parsing tasks of ribs, spine, and abdominal organs.
For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for
quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs.
Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of
97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%) in high efficiency, compared
favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and
nnU-Net). For spine identification and segmentation, our method achieves a new

LTR problems, we conduct Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) to learn
generalized features. With ample and solid evidence, we show that MGP is more
robust than supervised manners. In addition, Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss,

We further propose the balanced BCE to ameliorate it with strong theoretical
groundings. Specially, we derive the unbiased extension of Sigmoid and
compensate extra logit margins to deploy it. Our Bal-BCE contributes to the
quick convergence of ViTs in just a few epochs. Extensive experiments

release version of DR7, including 6,079,235 effective spectra of 4,546,803
stars. Based on the duplicate observational sample and comparing the deviation
of multiple measurements to their given errors, we find that, in general, the
error of [{\alpha}/M] is largely underestimated, and the error of radial
velocity is slightly overestimated. We define a correction factor k to quantify
these misestimations and correct the errors to be expressed as proper internal
uncertainties. Using this self-calibration technique, we find that the
k-factors significantly vary with the stellar spectral types and the spectral
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Particularly, we reveal a strange but evident
trend between k-factors and error themselves for all five stellar parameters.
Larger errors tend to have smaller k-factor values, i.e., they were more
overestimated. After the correction, we recreate and quantify the tight
correlations between SNR and errors, for all five parameters, while these
correlations have dependence on spectral types. It also suggests that the
parameter errors from each spectrum should be corrected individually. Finally,
we provide the error correction factors of each derived parameter of each

how the image will be edited. We utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to
generate edited images aligned with the user's intention with pixel-wise
guidance. The effective combination of proposed guidance and other techniques
enables highly controllable editing with preserving the outside of the edited
area, which results in meeting our requirements. The experimental results
demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the GAN-based method for editing
quality and speed.

reverse path, the image formation would be blocked. Here, we report the first
demonstration of unidirectional imagers, presenting polarization-insensitive
and broadband unidirectional imaging based on successive diffractive layers
that are linear and isotropic. These diffractive layers are optimized using
deep learning and consist of hundreds of thousands of diffractive phase
features, which collectively modulate the incoming fields and project an
intensity image of the input onto an output FOV, while blocking the image
formation in the reverse direction. After their deep learning-based training,
the resulting diffractive layers are fabricated to form a unidirectional
imager. As a reciprocal device, the diffractive unidirectional imager has
asymmetric mode processing capabilities in the forward and backward directions,
where the optical modes from B to A are selectively guided/scattered to miss
the output FOV, whereas for the forward direction such modal losses are
minimized, yielding an ideal imaging system between the input and output FOVs.
Although trained using monochromatic illumination, the diffractive
unidirectional imager maintains its functionality over a large spectral band
and works under broadband illumination. We experimentally validated this
unidirectional imager using terahertz radiation, very well matching our
numerical results. Using the same deep learning-based design strategy, we also
created a wavelength-selective unidirectional imager, where two unidirectional
imaging operations, in reverse directions, are multiplexed through different
illumination wavelengths. Diffractive unidirectional imaging using structured
materials will have numerous applications in e.g., security, defense,
telecommunications and privacy protection.

between $\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ via a topological connection
between $S^{2^n-1}$ and $S^n$. Throughout the paper we utilize the algebra of
Multicomplex rotation groups and polyspherical coordinates to define two maps:
the first is a contraction from $S^{2^n-1}$ to $\displaystyle \otimes^n_{k=1}
SO(2)$, and the second is a projection from $\displaystyle \otimes^n_{k=1}
SO(2)$ to $S^{n}$. Together these form a composite map that we call the LG
Fibration. In analogy to the generation of Hopf Fibration using Hypercomplex
geometry from $S^{(2n-1)} \mapsto CP^n$, our fibration uses Multicomplex
geometry to project $S^{2^n-1}$ onto $S^n$. We also investigate the algebraic
properties of the LG Fibration, ultimately deriving a distance difference
function to determine which pairs of vectors have an invariant inner product
under the transformation. The LG Fibration has applications to Machine Learning
and AI, in analogy to the current applications of Hopf Fibrations in adaptive
UAV control. Furthermore, the ability to invert the LG Fibration for nearly all

avoid the issues of uncertainty and reproducibility that currently plague

the content of audio clips with natural language sentences. This task has
attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent
years. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the
content of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often
deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple
(e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating
the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe
the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound
events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct
words and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the
ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across
similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework
based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve
diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid
discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can
be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and
the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different
criteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on
the Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate
captions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

refactoring operation. Because some identifiers are related to each other,
developers may need to rename related identifiers together. Aims: To understand
how developers rename multiple identifiers simultaneously, it is necessary to
consider the relationships between identifiers in the program and the brief
matching for non-identical but semantically similar identifiers. Method: We
investigate the relationships between co-renamed identifiers and identify the
types of their relationships that contribute to improving the recommendation
using more than 1M of renaming instances collected from the histories of
open-source software projects. We also evaluate and compare the impact of
co-renaming and the relationships between identifiers when inflections occur in
the words in identifiers are taken into account. Results: We revealed several
relationships of identifiers that are frequently found in the co-renamed
identifiers, such as the identifiers of methods in the same class or an
identifier defining a variable and another used for initializing the variable,
depending on the type of the renamed identifiers. Additionally, the
consideration of inflections did not affect the tendency of the relationships.
Conclusion: These results suggest an approach that prioritizes the identifiers
to be recommended depending on their types and the type of the renamed
identifier.

defenses exhibit weak resilience against threatening attacks, as the
effectiveness builds upon the unrealistic assumptions that deep neural networks
are simplified as linear models. In this paper, without such unrealistic
assumptions, we present a novel defense, called Refiner, instead of perturbing
gradients, which refines ground-truth data to craft robust data that yields
sufficient utility but with the least amount of privacy information, and then
the gradients of robust data are uploaded. To craft robust data, Refiner
promotes the gradients of critical parameters associated with robust data to
close ground-truth ones while leaving the gradients of trivial parameters to
safeguard privacy. Moreover, to exploit the gradients of trivial parameters,
Refiner utilizes a well-designed evaluation network to steer robust data far

which enjoys ultra-low model complexity while still achieving high accuracy. In
order to fully reap such attractive algorithmic benefit, we further develop the
corresponding customized hardware architecture to support the efficient
execution of the proposed FDHT-LSTM model. With the delicate design of memory
access scheme, the complicated matrix transformation can be efficiently
supported by the underlying hardware without any access conflict in an
on-the-fly way. Our evaluation results show that both the proposed

better performance in throughput, area efficiency and energy efficiency,

The paper then assumes that both the terrestrial base-stations and the hot-air

user-to-transmitter scheduling and the associated beamforming policies in the
downlink direction of cloud-enabled HAPS systems by maximizing two different

both subject to limited transmit power and finite fronthaul capacity. The paper
proposes solving the two non-convex discrete and continuous optimization
problems using numerical iterative optimization algorithms. The proposed
algorithms rely on well-chosen convexification and approximation steps, namely,
fractional programming and sparse beamforming via re-weighted $\ell_0$-norm
approximation. The numerical results outline the yielded gain illustrated

representation learning by extracting high-level features from nodes and their
topology. Since GCNs generally follow a message-passing mechanism, each node
aggregates information from its first-order neighbour to update its
representation. As a result, the representations of nodes with edges between
them should be positively correlated and thus can be considered positive
samples. However, there are more non-neighbour nodes in the whole graph, which
provide diverse and useful information for the representation update. Two
non-adjacent nodes usually have different representations, which can be seen as
negative samples. Besides the node representations, the structural information
of the graph is also crucial for learning. In this paper, we used
quality-diversity decomposition in determinant point processes (DPP) to obtain
diverse negative samples. When defining a distribution on diverse subsets of
all non-neighbouring nodes, we incorporate both graph structure information and
node representations. Since the DPP sampling process requires matrix eigenvalue
decomposition, we propose a new shortest-path-base method to improve
computational efficiency. Finally, we incorporate the obtained negative samples
into the graph convolution operation. The ideas are evaluated empirically in
experiments on node classification tasks. These experiments show that the newly

important implications for their environmental impact, is poorly understood.
The X-ray/radio positional offsets in individual features of jets provide
important clues. Extending the previous work in Reddy et al. 2021, we present a
detailed comparison between X-ray maps deconvolved using the Low Count Image
Reconstruction and Analysis (LIRA) tool and radio maps of 164 components from
77 Chandra-detected X-ray jets. We detect 94 offsets (57%), with 58 new
detections. In FR II-type jet knots, the X-rays peak and decay before the radio
in about half the cases, disagreeing with the predictions of one-zone models.
While a similar number of knots lack statistically significant offsets, we
argue that projection and distance effects result in offsets below the
detection level. Similar de-projected offsets imply that X-rays could be more
compact than radio for most knots, and we qualitatively reproduce this finding
with a ""moving-knot"" model. The bulk Lorentz factor derived for knots under
this model is consistent with previous radio-based estimates, suggesting
kpc-scale jets are only mildly relativistic. An analysis of X-ray/radio flux
ratio distributions does not support the commonly invoked mechanism of X-ray
production from inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background
but does show a marginally significant trend of declining flux ratio as a
function of distance from the core. Our results imply the need for multi-zone
models to explain the X-ray emission from powerful jets. We provide an

multiple agents to efficiently accomplish complex, long-horizon tasks. The
agents often have difficulties in cooperating on common goals, dividing complex

address these challenges by guiding agents with programs designed for
parallelization, since programs as a representation contain rich structural and
semantic information, and are widely used as abstractions for long-horizon
tasks. Specifically, we introduce Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
with Parallel Program Guidance(E-MAPP), a novel framework that leverages
parallel programs to guide multiple agents to efficiently accomplish goals that
require planning over $10+$ stages. E-MAPP integrates the structural
information from a parallel program, promotes the cooperative behaviors
grounded in program semantics, and improves the time efficiency via a task
allocator. We conduct extensive experiments on a series of challenging,
long-horizon cooperative tasks in the Overcooked environment. Results show that
E-MAPP outperforms strong baselines in terms of the completion rate, time
efficiency, and zero-shot generalization ability by a large margin.

SETI searches can probe on the order of ten-thousand stars for human-scale
technology (e.g. radio waves), LIGO can probe all 10$^{11}$ stars in the Milky
Way for RAMAcraft. Moreover, thanks to the $f^{-1}$ scaling of RAMAcraft
signals, our sensitivity to these objects will increase as low-frequency
detectors are developed and improved, allowing for the detection of smaller
masses further from Earth. In particular, we find that DECIGO and the Big Bang

improve sensitivities to objects with long acceleration periods. In this paper,
we calculate the waveforms for linearly-accelerating RAMAcraft in a form
suitable for LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA searches and provide the range for a

Although the cores gain angular momentum with various directions from the

exponentially and uniformly convergent, and robust against disturbance during

demonstrate that in the scalar channel $A_1^{++}$ we obtain an additional,
lightest state due to the inclusion of light dynamical quarks while the next

distinguish between objects of interest (in-distribution) and irrelevant
objects (e.g., OOD objects) on images that contain multiple objects from
different categories. These abilities allow us to convert a regular object
detection model into an image classifier with inherent OOD detection

existing contrastive-based solutions that typically represent an input skeleton

proposed HiCo represents the input into multiple-level features and performs
contrast in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, given a human skeleton
sequence, we represent it into multiple feature vectors of different
granularities from both temporal and spatial domains via sequence-to-sequence
(S2S) encoders and unified downsampling modules. Besides, the hierarchical
contrast is conducted in terms of four levels: instance level, domain level,
clip level, and part level. Moreover, HiCo is orthogonal to the S2S encoder,
which allows us to flexibly embrace state-of-the-art S2S encoders. Extensive
experiments on four datasets, i.e., NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I and II, show
that HiCo achieves a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised skeleton-based
action representation learning in two downstream tasks including action

of deep neural networks (DNNs). Some works attempted to explain the success of
stochastic optimization for deep learning by the arguably heavy-tail properties
of gradient noise, while other works presented theoretical and empirical
evidence against the heavy-tail hypothesis on gradient noise. Unfortunately,
formal statistical tests for analyzing the structure and heavy tails of
stochastic gradients in deep learning are still under-explored. In this paper,
we mainly make two contributions. First, we conduct formal statistical tests on
the distribution of stochastic gradients and gradient noise across both
parameters and iterations. Our statistical tests reveal that dimension-wise
gradients usually exhibit power-law heavy tails, while iteration-wise gradients
and stochastic gradient noise caused by minibatch training usually do not
exhibit power-law heavy tails. Second, we further discover that the covariance
spectra of stochastic gradients have the power-law structures in deep learning.
While previous papers believed that the anisotropic structure of stochastic
gradients matters to deep learning, they did not expect the gradient covariance
can have such an elegant mathematical structure. Our work challenges the
existing belief and provides novel insights on the structure of stochastic
gradients in deep learning.

an end-to-end framework to learn the deep representation from spatial feature

The goal is to consecutively move a sequence of 3D objects with arbitrary

sequence. Meanwhile, we take physical realizability into account, involving
physics dynamics and constraints of a placement. The packing policy should
understand the 3D geometry of the object to be packed and make effective
decisions to accommodate it in the container in a physically realizable way. We
propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline to learn the policy. The complex
irregular geometry and imperfect object placement together lead to huge
solution space. Direct training in such space is prohibitively data intensive.
We instead propose a theoretically-provable method for candidate action
generation to reduce the action space of RL and the learning burden. A
parameterized policy is then learned to select the best placement from the
candidates. Equipped with an efficient method of asynchronous RL acceleration
and a data preparation process of simulation-ready training sequences, a mature

model with all the fundamental symmetries (particle-hole, chiral, and
time-reversal) preserved. This model is topologically trivial irrespective of
the topological property of the individual SSH chain. In order to introduce
nontrivial topology in the system, we need to break some of these system
symmetries. The symmetries are systematically broken by tuning the basic model
with the introduction of different hopping terms. The Chern number (C) is used
here as a topological invariant of the system. Our study reveals that a minimum
requirement for the induction of the nontrivial topology in the system is to
break the chiral and the time-reversal (TR) symmetry. The chiral symmetry is
broken by introducing intra-sub-lattice hopping in the system. Following
Haldane, the same intra-sub-lattice hopping strengths are considered imaginary
to break the TR-symmetry in the system. In this study, we preserve the
particle-hole symmetry in the system. The presence of this symmetry in the
system facilitates an analytical calculation of the Chern number. We
numerically observe that this model exhibits nontrivial topology with only |C|
= 1. This result is justified by an analytical calculation of the Chern number.

known when addressing fiber-strictly convex Lagrangian. For infinite time
horizons, or for settings with infinite dimensional dynamics, the equivalence
between minima/maxima and extremals could break down. Commonly, this is due to
a loss of convexity/concavity of the cost functional or to a presence of state
constraints, in which further controllability assumptions are needed. For many
science applications, this a trend is not required, as in energy saving
problems. In the present paper, we deal with the set of a functional's
extremals subject to end-point restrictions. We consider an affine control
system and a cost functional associated to an autonomous Lagrangian. The
dynamics is smooth, satisfying the Lie bracket condition, and the functional is
assumed merely Fr\'echet differentiable. Here we provide a regularity result
for controls in the context of constrained extremization problems, under weaker
conditions on Lagrangian than the not met classical ones. More precisely, we

hypergraph, we introduce some positive valued functions on the set of vertices

some distance-based hypergraph centrality on the set of vertices by employing a

that both the Van der Waals parameters $a$ and $b$ have a significant effect on

a homogeneous plasma medium decreases while parameter $\sigma
=\frac{\omega_p}{\omega_{\infty}}$ ( the ratio of plasma frequency and photon
frequency) increases and the radius of the shadow inhomogeneous plasma medium
is larger than the vacuum medium. We also discuss the strong gravitational
lensing in a homogeneous plasma medium. We observe that the photon sphere
radius, deflection limit coefficients and deflection angle in the strong field
are highly affected by the presence of a homogeneous plasma medium. We also
find that the deflection angle in the strong field limit by the Van der Waals
black hole with the homogeneous plasma is greater than that of the Vacuum
medium. Further, we discuss the observables quantities angular position
$\theta_{\infty}$, separation $S$ and magnification $r_{mag}$ by taking the

transductive reasoning and online inductive learning to achieve accurate and
robust semi-supervised video object segmentation (SVOS). However, using the
mask embedding as the label to guide the generation of target features in the
two branches may result in inadequate target representation and degrade the
performance. Besides, how to reasonably fuse the target features in the two
different branches rather than simply adding them together to avoid the adverse
effect of one dominant branch has not been investigated. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework that emphasizes Learning to Learn Better (LLB) target
features for SVOS, termed LLB, where we design the discriminative label
generation module (DLGM) and the adaptive fusion module to address these
issues. Technically, the DLGM takes the background-filtered frame instead of
the target mask as input and adopts a lightweight encoder to generate the
target features, which serves as the label of the online few-shot learner and
the value of the decoder in the transformer to guide the two branches to learn
more discriminative target representation. The adaptive fusion module maintains
a learnable gate for each branch, which reweighs the element-wise feature
representation and allows an adaptive amount of target information in each
branch flowing to the fused target feature, thus preventing one branch from
being dominant and making the target feature more robust to distractor.
Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our proposed LLB method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

While, although the instantaneous eigenstates are localized, the charge
transport remains quantized. This is attributed to delocalized Floquet states

the disorder-induced delocalization-localization transition of Floquet states.

electromagnetic fields. The RRMHD simulation is performed with these initial
conditions in Au-Au and Cu-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV.
We have calculated the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow $\Delta

distributions as a consequence of RRMHD. Our results show that the $\Delta v_1$

need to learn from a dataset collected by rolling out multiple behavior
policies. There are two challenges for this setting: 1) The optimal trade-off
between optimizing the RL signal and the behavior cloning (BC) signal changes
on different states due to the variation of the action coverage induced by
different behavior policies. Previous methods fail to handle this by only
controlling the global trade-off. 2) For a given state, the action distribution
generated by different behavior policies may have multiple modes. The BC
regularizers in many previous methods are mean-seeking, resulting in policies
that select out-of-distribution (OOD) actions in the middle of the modes. In
this paper, we address both challenges by using adaptively weighted reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the BC regularizer based on the TD3
algorithm. Our method not only trades off the RL and BC signals with per-state
weights (i.e., strong BC regularization on the states with narrow action

impressive performance, yet unconstrained face recognition still represents an

the quality of the input samples that can help provide information on the
confidence of the recognition decision and eventually lead to improved results

quality assessment in recent years, computing reliable quality scores for
diverse facial images and FR models remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to face image quality assessment, called FaceQAN, that
is based on adversarial examples and relies on the analysis of adversarial
noise which can be calculated with any FR model learned by using some form of
gradient descent. As such, the proposed approach is the first to link image
quality to adversarial attacks. Comprehensive (cross-model as well as
model-specific) experiments are conducted with four benchmark datasets, i.e.,
LFW, CFP-FP, XQLFW and IJB-C, four FR models, i.e., CosFace, ArcFace,
CurricularFace and ElasticFace, and in comparison to seven state-of-the-art
FIQA methods to demonstrate the performance of FaceQAN. Experimental results
show that FaceQAN achieves competitive results, while exhibiting several

different objectives; 1) the 2-norm tracking error, and 2) a bi-objective
consisting of the 2-norm tracking error and a 2-norm input rate of movement
penalty. We apply the method to design MPC for an exothermic chemical reaction
conducted in an adiabatic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The process
is of interest as the nonlinear dynamics result in a desired operating point
very close to a constraint. Our MPC design includes stage costs automatically
designed to match the tuned PI controllers, hard input constraints, and a soft
output constraint. Stochastic simulation results show that both the PI
controller and the MPC can track the desired operating point. However, the MPC
shows reduced output constraint violation compared to the PI controller. As

the trade-off between capacity utilization and consumer welfare. Therefore, the
capacity price is set at a point where the cost of investment is exactly offset

intra-band motion, and field-driven band dressing, all concur in determining
the overall excited electron population, dictating the electro-optical
properties of a material. Here we investigate ultrafast photoinjection in a
prototypical semiconductor (monocrystalline germanium) by using attosecond
transient reflection spectroscopy. The precise pump-field characterization
ensured by a simultaneous attosecond streaking experiment, in tandem with a
comprehensive theoretical approach, allowed us to disentangle the different
physical phenomena unfolding at different positions in the reciprocal space and
at different timing within the envelope of the pump pulse. Moreover, we found
that intra-band phenomena hinder charge injection, in contrast to what was
previously observed for resonant, direct band-gap semiconductors. Therefore,
besides other known parameters as the central wavelength and peak intensity,
our results indicate that the pulse temporal envelope and the local band
structure probed by intra-band effects are of key importance to achieve an
optimal control over the ultrafast carrier injection process and tailor the
complex optical and electronic properties of a semiconductor on the few- to
sub-femtosecond time scale.

the Boltzmann equation and its main properties are of substantial importance.
The decomposition into a sum of a positive multiplication operator, the
collision frequency, and an integral operator is trivial. Compactness of the
integral operator for monatomic single species is a classical result, while
corresponding results for monatomic mixtures and polyatomic single species are
more recently obtained. This work concerns the compactness of the operator for
a multicomponent mixture of polyatomic species, where the polyatomicity is
modeled by a discrete internal energy variable. With a probabilistic
formulation of the collision operator as a starting point, compactness is
obtained by proving that the integral operator is a sum of Hilbert-Schmidt
integral operators and operators, which are uniform limits of Hilbert-Schmidt
integral operators, under some assumptions on the collision kernel. The
assumptions are essentially generalizations of the Grad's assumptions for
monatomic single species. Self-adjointness of the linearized collision operator
follows. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision
frequency are obtained for a hard sphere like model. Then it follows that the
linearized collision operator is a Fredholm operator, and its domain is also
obtained.

qualitatively with solid volume fraction $\phi$, and resulting in a force that
tends to reduce or enhance the direction of flow for small or large $\phi$.

cap, small icy patches left behind in shady places due to the low thermal
conductivity of the Martian surface and atmosphere, are met by direct sunlight
during the summer. These patches might warm up substantially and we analyzed
below how could a liquid phase emerge in these places, surveying HiRISE images.
730 images that fit the selection criteria of location and season were
analyzed, and we identified 148 images with smaller ice patches on them. Their
separation from other bright patches, like clouds or lighter shades of layers
and rocks were possible by their bluish color and strong connection to local
topographic shading. These areas range between 140{\deg} and 200{\deg} solar
longitude in the latitude band between -40{\deg} and -60{\deg}. The diameter of
the ice patches ranges between 1.5-300 meters, and they remain on the surface
even after the seasonal polar cap has passed over the area for the duration
range of 19-133 martian days.
  With the help of The Mars Climate Database (MCD) we simulated the surface
temperature and predicted CO2 and H2O ice cover at 22 analyzed areas. Judging
by the models, the average noon temperature does not reach the melting point of
water, which is 273 K, therefore the occurrence of liquid water on the
macroscopic scale is highly unlikely, however there is a possibility that an
interfacial premelting of ice (a few nanometers thick waterlayer) might form
between the layered and the water ice.

of the core tasks in natural language processing. However, maximization-based
decoding methods (e.g., greedy/beam search) often lead to the degeneration
problem, i.e., the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable
repetitions. Existing solutions to this problem either introduce randomness
prone to incoherence or require a look-ahead mechanism that demands extra
computational overhead. In this study, we formulate open-ended text generation
from a new perspective, i.e., we view it as an exploration process within a
directed graph. Thereby, we understand the phenomenon of degeneration as
circular loops within the directed graph. Based on our formulation, we propose
a novel decoding method -- \textit{momentum decoding} -- which encourages the
LM to \textit{greedily} explore new nodes outside the current graph. Meanwhile,
it also allows the LM to return to the existing nodes with a momentum
downgraded by a pre-defined resistance function. We extensively test our
approach on three benchmarks from different domains through automatic and human
evaluations. The results show that momentum decoding performs comparably with
the current state of the art while enjoying notably improved inference speed

rapidly in the last decade. Understanding the demand for these services is
essential for planning and managing modern transportation systems. Existing
studies develop statistical models for ride-sourcing demand estimation at an
aggregate level due to limited data availability. These models lack foundations
in microeconomic theory, ignore competition of ride-sourcing with other travel
modes, and cannot be seamlessly integrated into existing individual-level
(disaggregate) activity-based models to evaluate system-level impacts of
ride-sourcing services. In this paper, we present and apply an approach for
estimating ride-sourcing demand at a disaggregate level using discrete choice
models and multiple data sources. We first construct a sample of trip-based
mode choices in Chicago, USA by enriching household travel survey with publicly
available ride-sourcing and taxi trip records. We then formulate a multivariate
extreme value-based discrete choice with sampling and endogeneity corrections
to account for the construction of the estimation sample from multiple data
sources and endogeneity biases arising from supply-side constraints and surge
pricing mechanisms in ride-sourcing systems. Our analysis of the constructed
dataset reveals insights into the influence of various socio-economic, land use

elasticities of ride-sourcing demand relative to travel cost and time. Finally,
we illustrate how the developed model can be employed to quantify the welfare
implications of ride-sourcing policies and regulations such as terminating
certain types of services and introducing ride-sourcing taxes.

of traditional RL algorithms has been their poor sample efficiency. One

dynamics and reward function, use it to generate imaginary trajectories and
backpropagate through them to update the policy, exploiting the
differentiability of the model. Intuitively, learning more accurate models
should lead to better model-based RL performance. Recently, there has been
growing interest in developing better deep neural network based dynamics models
for physical systems, by utilizing the structure of the underlying physics. We
focus on robotic systems undergoing rigid body motion without contacts. We
compare two versions of our model-based RL algorithm, one which uses a standard
deep neural network based dynamics model and the other which uses a much more
accurate, physics-informed neural network based dynamics model. We show that,
in model-based RL, model accuracy mainly matters in environments that are
sensitive to initial conditions, where numerical errors accumulate fast. In
these environments, the physics-informed version of our algorithm achieves
significantly better average-return and sample efficiency. In environments that
are not sensitive to initial conditions, both versions of our algorithm achieve
similar average-return, while the physics-informed version achieves better
sample efficiency. We also show that, in challenging environments,
physics-informed model-based RL achieves better average-return than
state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithms such as Soft Actor-Critic, as it

collisions of the particles with the hard walls inject energy in the direction
perpendicular to the wall, so that stationary states can be reached in the
long-time limit. The velocity distribution of the tagged particle verifies a
Boltzmann-Lorentz-like equation that is solved assuming that it is a spatially
homogeneous gaussian distribution with two different temperatures (one
associated to the motion parallel to the wall and another associated to the
perpendicular direction). It is found that the temperature perpendicular to the
wall diverges when the tagged particle mass approaches a critical mass from
below, while the parallel temperature remains finite. Molecular Dynamics
simulation results agree very well with the theoretical predictions for tagged
particle masses below the critical mass. The measurements of the velocity
distribution function of the tagged particle confirm that it is gaussian if the
mass is not close to the critical mass, while it deviates from gaussianity when
approaching the critical mass. Above the critical mass, the velocity
distribution function is very far from a gaussian, being the marginal
distribution in the perpendicular direction bimodal and with a much larger

  Turbulence",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A net force can arise on objects which lie in systems with complex energy
partitions, even if the system is on average stationary. These forces are
usually called fluctuation forces, as they arise due to the objects modifying
the character of the fluctuations within the system. We continue the
investigation of Spandan \emph{et al.}, \textit{Sci. Adv., 6(14), eaba0461}
(2020), who found an attractive fluctuation force between two parallel plates
in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). By conducting simulations which
systematically vary the plate size, and Reynolds number, we confirm the
two-fold origin of the force in HIT: the plates restrict the presence of energy
structures in the slit, and pack intense vortical structures which stretch each
other causing the pressure to drop. At $Re_\lambda=100$, we find that small
plates cannot effectively pack structures, and this causes the force to behave
in a monotonic manner, with a maximum force for the smallest plate separations.
Medium and large plates show a non-monotonic behaviour of the force with plate
distance consistent with earlier studies, demonstrating that if the plates are
large enough to pack structures their size is not an important determinant of
the force. By decreasing $Re_\lambda$, we show that removing vortex stretching
decreases the attractive force, but does not completely eliminate it, and that
the non-monotonic character of the force is due to vortex stretching. These
results support the two-fold origin of the force, while shedding further light
on the mechanisms that generate it.

damping on the one dimensional torus and we investigate the stability of some
solitary wave profiles within the dissipative dynamics. The undamped cubic NLS
equation is well known to admit a family of periodic waves given by Jacobi
elliptic functions of cnoidal type. We show that the family of cnoidal waves is
orbitally stable. More precisely, by considering a sufficiently small
perturbation of a given cnoidal wave at initial time, the evolution will always
remain close (up to symmetries of the equation) to the cnoidal wave whose mass
is modulated according to the dissipative dynamics. This result extends the
concept of orbital stability to this non-Hamiltonian evolution. Since cnoidal
waves are not exact solutions to the damped NLS, the perturbation is forced
away from the family of solitary wave profiles. In order to control this
secular growth of the error, we find a first order approximation of the
solitary wave that takes into account the dissipative term. Then we use a
suitable, exponentially decreasing Lyapunov functional that controls the
$H^1$-norm of the perturbation around the approximated solitons.

existing generative methods still have plenty of room for improvement in
quantitative performance. More crucially, these methods are considered black
boxes due to weak interpretability and there is rarely a theory trying to
explain their mechanism and learning process. In this study, we try to
re-interpret these generative methods for image restoration tasks using
information theory. Different from conventional understanding, we analyzed the

information that is absent from the source inputs) are involved and optimized
respectively in generating the restoration results. We further derived their
learning behaviors, optimization objectives, and the corresponding information
boundaries by extending the information bottleneck principle. Based on this
theoretic framework, we found that many existing generative methods tend to be
direct applications of the general models designed for conventional generation
tasks, which may suffer from problems including over-invested abstraction
processes, inherent details loss, and vanishing gradients or imbalance in
training. We analyzed these issues with both intuitive and theoretical
explanations and proved them with empirical evidence respectively. Ultimately,
we proposed general solutions or ideas to address the above issue and validated
these approaches with performance boosts on six datasets of three different

LDT and PDT graphs are cographs, this is not true for the EDT graph in general.

recognition of EDT graphs without knowledge of putative LDT and PDT graphs is
NP-complete for general scenarios. We finally connect the EDT graph to the

using the CCFLY code of inner-shell lasing in solid density Mg, where we
self-consistently treat the effects of the incoming FEL radiation and the

working gas at a given flow rate to produce a plasma jet. Helium (He) is one of
the gases commonly used as the carrier gas to generate cold atmospheric

found through measurements of gas temperature ($T_{gas}$), using fiber optic

possible to produce plasma jets with temperatures lower than 40 $^\circ$C at

which provides a useful supervised signal to calibrate predictions. Thus, our
method directly augments the predictions with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN)
classifier over a datastore of cached few-shot instance representations

selection and feature regularization modules are introduced to make full use of
a few support instances to reduce the $k$NN retrieval noise. Experiments on

the problem, this paper presents an Event-based SAI (E-SAI) method by relying
on the asynchronous events with extremely low latency and high dynamic range

refocused by a Refocus-Net module to align in-focus events while scattering out

of reconstruction accuracy. While this approach works well for components like
windows and doors, there is no solution for fa\c{c}ade background at present.
In this paper, we introduce the concept of representative region texture, which
can be used in the above modeling approach by tiling the representative texture
around the fa\c{c}ade region, and propose a semi-supervised way to do
representative region texture extraction from a fa\c{c}ade image. Our method
does not require any additional labelled data to train as long as the semantic
information is given, while a traditional end-to-end model requires plenty of
data to increase its performance. Our method can extract texture from any
repetitive images, not just fa\c{c}ade, which is not capable in an end-to-end
model as it relies on the distribution of training set. Clustering with
weighted distance is introduced to further increase the robustness to noise or
an imprecise segmentation, and make the extracted texture have a higher
resolution and more suitable for tiling. We verify our method on various
fa\c{c}ade images, and the result shows our method has a significant
performance improvement compared to only a random crop on fa\c{c}ade. We also
demonstrate some application scenarios and proposed a fa\c{c}ade modeling

resolution for a regular fa\c{c}ade.

new promising probes for the cold gas content and star formation rate of
galaxies across cosmic time. However, both of these two measurements suffer
from field-to-field variance. We study the effect of field-to-field variance on
the predicted CO and [CII] power spectra from future LIM experiments such as
CONCERTO, as well as on the line luminosity functions (LFs) and the cosmic
molecular gas mass density that are currently derived from spectral line scans.
We combined a 117 $\rm deg^2$ dark matter lightcone from the Uchuu cosmological
simulation with the simulated infrared dusty extragalactic sky (SIDES)
approach. We find that in order to constrain the CO LF with an uncertainty
below 20%, we need survey sizes of at least 0.1 $\rm deg^2$. Furthermore,
accounting for the field-to-field variance using only the Poisson variance can
underestimate the total variance by up to 80%. The lower the luminosity is and
the larger the survey size is, the higher the level of underestimate. At $z$<3,
the impact of field-to-field variance on the cosmic molecular gas density can
be as high as 40% for the 4.6 arcmin$^2$ field, but drops below 10% for areas
larger than 0.2 deg$^2$. However, at $z>3$ the variance decreases more slowly
with survey size and for example drops below 10% for 1 deg$^2$ fields. Finally,
we find that the CO and [CII] LIM power spectra can vary by up to 50% in $\rm 1
deg^2$ fields. This limits the accuracy of the constraints provided by the
first 1 deg$^2$ surveys. The level of the shot noise power is always dominated
by the sources that are just below the detection thresholds. We provide an
analytical formula to estimate the field-to-field variance of current or future
LIM experiments. The code and the full SIDES-Uchuu products (catalogs, cubes,

localization on braneworlds with the Einstein equation. In that paper, we
discussed the consistency of the spinor field confinement and, by using a

shape of the scalar function emerge from the requirement that the spin
$\frac{1}{2}$ (zero-mode) localization cannot modify the metric on bulk. This
ensures that the confinement of gravity on the brane is preserved. In the

generate this interaction. This provide a new mechanism for localizing fermion
fields over the brane. We also discuss massive modes and we found some

constructs a polynomial number of sub-samples of the training data, each of

heuristic bagging (a.k.a. bootstrap aggregation), due to Breiman (1996), is in
fact also an optimal PAC learner. Bagging pre-dates Hanneke's algorithm by
twenty years and is taught in most undergraduate machine learning courses.

formally introduce a symbolic quantum program model. This allows to encode the
verification problem in an SMT formula, which can then be checked with a
delta-complete decision procedure. We also propose an abstraction technique to
speed up the verification process. Experimental results show that the
abstraction improves symQV's scalability by an order of magnitude to quantum
programs with 24 qubits (a 2^24-dimensional state space).

them to colorize each frame is vital for exemplar-based video colorization. In
this paper, we present an effective BiSTNet to explore colors of reference
exemplars and utilize them to help video colorization by a bidirectional
temporal feature fusion with the guidance of semantic image prior. We first
establish the semantic correspondence between each frame and the reference
exemplars in deep feature space to explore color information from reference
exemplars. Then, to better propagate the colors of reference exemplars into
each frame and avoid the inaccurate matches colors from exemplars we develop a
simple yet effective bidirectional temporal feature fusion module to better
colorize each frame. We note that there usually exist color-bleeding artifacts
around the boundaries of the important objects in videos. To overcome this
problem, we further develop a mixed expert block to extract semantic
information for modeling the object boundaries of frames so that the semantic
image prior can better guide the colorization process for better performance.
In addition, we develop a multi-scale recurrent block to progressively colorize
frames in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BiSTNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods

  Repeatable Feature Detector and Rotation-invariant Feature Descriptor","33 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Automatically identifying feature correspondences between multimodal images
is facing enormous challenges because of the significant differences both in
radiation and geometry. To address these problems, we propose a novel feature
matching method (named R2FD2) that is robust to radiation and rotation
differences. Our R2FD2 is conducted in two critical contributions, consisting
of a repeatable feature detector and a rotation-invariant feature descriptor.
In the first stage, a repeatable feature detector called the Multi-channel
Auto-correlation of the Log-Gabor (MALG) is presented for feature detection,
which combines the multi-channel auto-correlation strategy with the Log-Gabor
wavelets to detect interest points (IPs) with high repeatability and uniform
distribution. In the second stage, a rotation-invariant feature descriptor is
constructed, named the Rotation-invariant Maximum index map of the Log-Gabor
(RMLG), which consists of two components: fast assignment of dominant
orientation and construction of feature representation. In the process of fast
assignment of dominant orientation, a Rotation-invariant Maximum Index Map
(RMIM) is built to address rotation deformations. Then, the proposed RMLG
incorporates the rotation-invariant RMIM with the spatial configuration of
DAISY to depict a more discriminative feature representation, which improves
RMLG's resistance to radiation and rotation variances.Experimental results show
that the proposed R2FD2 outperforms five state-of-the-art feature matching
methods, and has superior advantages in adaptability and universality.
Moreover, our R2FD2 achieves the accuracy of matching within two pixels and has
a great advantage in matching efficiency over other state-of-the-art methods.

unsupervised depth estimation on unseen scenes without per-scene optimization.
Distinct from most existing generalized NeRFs, our framework infers the unseen

the generalized model, we introduce an unsupervised depth estimation module to
derive the coarse geometry, narrow down the ray sampling interval to proximity

constituting Geometry-Aware Dynamic Sampling strategy (GADS). Moreover, we
introduce a Multi-level Semantic Consistency loss (MSC) to assist more

Language Models (LLM) trained on web-scale text show impressive abilities to

provide a novel perspective on using an LLM to provide text supervision for a
zero-shot image classification model. The LLM is provided with a few text
descriptions from different annotators as examples. The LLM is conditioned on
these examples to generate multiple text descriptions for each class(referred
to as views). Our proposed model, I2MVFormer, learns multi-view semantic
embeddings for zero-shot image classification with these class views. We show
that each text view of a class provides complementary information allowing a
model to learn a highly discriminative class embedding. Moreover, we show that
I2MVFormer is better at consuming the multi-view text supervision from LLM

liquid-liquid phase separation (self-coacervation). We analyse the behavior of
the coacervate phase polymer concentration depending on the electrostatic
interaction strength -- the ratio of the Bjerrum length to the bond length of
the chain. We establish that in a wide range of polymer concentration values --
from a semi-dilute to a rather concentrated solution -- the chain connectivity
and excluded volume interaction of the monomeric units have an extremely weak
effect on the contribution of the electrostatic interactions of the dipolar
monomeric units to the total free energy. We show that for rather weak
electrostatic interactions, the electrostatic correlations manifest themselves
as Keesom interactions of point-like freely rotating dipoles (Keesom regime),
while in the region of strong electrostatic interactions the electrostatic free
energy is described by the Debye-H{\""u}ckel limiting law (Debye regime). We
show that for real zwitterionic coacervates the Keesom regime is realized only
for sufficiently small polymer concentrations of the coacervate phase, while
the Debye regime is approximately realized for rather dense coacervates. Using
the mean-field variant of the density functional theory, we calculate the
surface tension (surface free energy) of the $""$coacervate-solvent$""$ interface

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to support a wide variety of missions, such as

involving processing of areas larger than a single image, the mosaicking of UAV
imagery is a necessary step. Real-time image mosaicking is used for missions
that requires fast response like search and rescue missions. It typically
requires information from additional sensors, such as Global Position System

3D reconstruction approaches to recover the camera poses. This paper proposes a
UAV-based system for real-time creation of incremental mosaics which does not
require either direct or indirect camera parameters such as orientation
information. Inspired by previous approaches, in the mosaicking process,
feature extraction from images, matching of similar key points between images,
finding homography matrix to warp and align images, and blending images to
obtain mosaics better looking, plays important roles in the achievement of the
high quality result. Edge detection is used in the blending step as a novel
approach. Experimental results show that real-time incremental image mosaicking

rate-distortion loss and an entropy bottleneck to learn a compressed latent
representation for the task. The main idea of using a rate-distortion loss is
to introduce representation flexibility that ignores or becomes robust to
unlikely events with distinctive patterns, such as anomalies. These anomalies
manifest as unique distortion features that can be accurately detected in
testing conditions. This new architecture allows us to train a fully
unsupervised model that has high accuracy in detecting anomalies from a
distortion score despite being trained with some portion of unlabelled
anomalous data. This setting is in stark contrast to many of the
state-of-the-art unsupervised methodologies that require the model to be only
trained on ""normal data"". We argue that this partially violates the concept of
unsupervised training for anomaly detection as the model uses an informed
decision that selects what is normal from abnormal for training. Additionally,
there is evidence to suggest it also effects the models ability at
generalisation. We demonstrate that models that succeed in the paradigm where
they are only trained on normal data fail to be robust when anomalous data is
injected into the training. In contrast, our compression-based approach
converges to a robust representation that tolerates some anomalous distortion.
The robust representation achieved by a model using a rate-distortion loss can
be used in a more realistic unsupervised anomaly detection scheme.

the assimilation of observations in atmospheric and ocean models. In
variational data assimilation, inverse error covariance matrices define the
weighting matrices of the least-squares problem. For observation errors, a
diagonal matrix (i.e., uncorrelated errors) is often assumed for simplicity
even when observation errors are suspected to be correlated. While accounting
for observationerror correlations should improve the quality of the solution,
it also affects the convergence rate of the minimization algorithms used to
iterate to the solution. If the minimization process is stopped before reaching
full convergence, which is usually the case in operational applications, the
solution may be degraded even if the observation-error correlations are
correctly accounted for. In this article, we explore the influence of the
observation-error correlation matrix (R) on the convergence rate of a
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm applied to a one-dimensional
variational data assimilation (1D-Var) problem. We design the idealised 1D-Var
system to include two key features used in more complex systems: we use the
background error covariance matrix (B) as a preconditioner (B-PCG); and we use
a diffusion operator to model spatial correlations in B and R. Analytical and
numerical results with the 1D-Var system show a strong sensitivity of the
convergence rate of B-PCG to the parameters of the diffusion-based correlation
models. Depending on the parameter choices, correlated observation errors can
either speed up or slow down the convergence. In practice, a compromise may be
required in the parameter specifications of B and R between staying close to
the best available estimates on the one hand and ensuring an adequate
convergence rate of the minimization algorithm on the other.

controlled rotation two-qubit gate on hole spins in an industry-compatible
device. A short gate time of 24 ns is achieved. The quantum logic exploits an
exchange interaction that can be tuned from above 500 MHz to close-to-off.
Significantly, the exchange is strikingly anisotropic. By developing a general
theory, we show that the anisotropy arises as a consequence of a strong
spin-orbit interaction. Upon tunnelling from one quantum dot to the other, the
spin is rotated by almost 90 degrees. The exchange Hamiltonian no longer has
Heisenberg form and is engineered in such a way that there is no trade-off
between speed and fidelity of the two-qubit gate. This ideal behaviour applies
over a wide range of magnetic field orientations rendering the concept robust

non-spinning planets. We investigate the influence of planetary spin on the
wave behaviors within the BL. The rotation profile in such BLs would show sharp
transition from the rigid rotation to the Keplerian rotation. We examine the
angular momentum transport in these BL in terms of linear perturbation
analysis. We find that the global inertia-acoustic mode associated with
spinning planets would give rise to the inflow of angular momentum and the
accretion of gas. In this work, we identify a new kind of global mode, namely
the Rossby mode. The Rossby mode can lead to the outflow of angular momentum
and the decretion of gas from a spinning planet. The Rossby mode provide a
negative feedback that regulates the planetary spin and mass. We compare the
growth rate of the two modes as a function of the width of BL, the Mach number
and the spin rate of planet. Our results reveal the underlying hydrodynamic
mechanism of terminal spins and asymptotic mass of the giant planets.

two important questions: How many modes are there, and how can we estimate

Using the Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy, the efficiency of determining
the measurement and feedback operators in the MFCP is demonstrated. Taking the
one dimensional Bose-Hubbard model as an example, we show that BO can generate
optimal parameters, although constrained by the operator basis, which can drive
the system to the low energy state with high probability in typical quantum
trajectories.

measurements resulted in a substantial advancement for the determination of the
orbits for old star clusters, including the oldest Milky Way globular clusters
(MW GCs). The main goal of this paper is to use the Gaia DR3 and the VVVX
measurements to obtain the orbits for nearly a dozen new Galactic GC candidates
that have been poorly studied or previously unexplored. We use the Gaia DR3 and
VVVX databases to identify bonafide members of the Galactic GC candidates:
VVV-CL160, Patchick122, Patchick125, Patchick126, Kronberger99, Kronberger119,
Kronberger143, ESO92-18, ESO93-08, Gaia2, and Ferrero54. The relevant mean
cluster physical parameters are derived (distances, Galactic coordinates,
proper motions, RVs). We measure accurate mean RVs for the GCs VVV-CL160 and
Patchick126, using observations acquired at the Gemini-South telescope with the
IGRINS high-resolution spectrograph. Orbits for each cluster are then computed
using the GravPot16 model, assuming typical Galactic bar pattern speeds. We
reconstruct the orbits for these clusters for the first time. These include
star clusters with retrograde and prograde orbital motions, both in the
Galactic bulge and disk. Orbital properties, such as the mean time-variations
of perigalactic and apogalactic distances, eccentricities, vertical excursions
from the Galactic plane, and Z-components of the angular momentum are obtained
for our sample. Our main conclusion is that, based on the orbital parameters,
Patchick125 and Patchick126 are genuine MW bulge/halo GCs; Ferrero54, Gaia2 and
Patchick122 are MW disk GCs. The orbits of Kronberger99, Kronberger119,
Kronberger143, ESO92-18, and ESO93-08 are more consistent with old MW disk open
clusters. VVV-CL160 falls very close to the Galactic centre, but reaches larger
distances beyond the Sun, thus its origin is still unclear.

Conventional methods to perform Velocity Model Building (VMB) tasks rely on
inverse methods, which, despite being widely used, are ill-posed problems that
require intense and specialized human supervision. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) have been extensively investigated as an alternative to solve
the VMB task. Two main approaches were investigated in the literature:
supervised training and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). Supervised
training presents some generalization issues since structures, and velocity
ranges must be similar in training and test set. Some works integrated
Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) with CNN, defining the problem of VMB in the PINN
framework. In this case, the CNN stabilizes the inversion, acting like a
regularizer and avoiding local minima-related problems and, in some cases,
sparing an initial velocity model. Our approach combines supervised and
physics-informed neural networks by using transfer learning to start the
inversion. The pre-trained CNN is obtained using a supervised approach based on
training with a reduced and simple data set to capture the main velocity trend
at the initial FWI iterations. We show that transfer learning reduces the
uncertainties of the process, accelerates model convergence, and improves the
final scores of the iterative process.

The robustness
of the watermark determines the traceability of the algorithm. With the
development of digital technology, audio re-recording (AR) has become an
efficient and covert means to steal secrets. AR process could drastically
destroy the watermark signal while preserving the original information. This
puts forward a new requirement for audio watermarking at this stage, that is,
to be robust to AR distortions. Unfortunately, none of the existing algorithms
can effectively resist AR attacks due to the complexity of the AR process. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes DeAR, a deep-learning-based audio
re-recording resistant watermarking. Inspired by DNN-based image watermarking,
we pioneer a deep learning framework for audio carriers, based on which the
watermark signal can be effectively embedded and extracted. Meanwhile, in order
to resist the AR attack, we delicately analyze the distortions that occurred in
the AR process and design the corresponding distortion layer to cooperate with
the proposed watermarking framework. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed algorithm can resist not only common electronic channel distortions
but also AR distortions. Under the premise of high-quality embedding
(SNR=25.86dB), in the case of a common re-recording distance (20cm), the
algorithm can effectively achieve an average bit recovery accuracy of 98.55%.

independently, and the expansion process is difficult to achieve a favorable
accuracy-speed trade-off. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and
Boundary-guided Network (CBN) to tackle these problems. In CBN, a basic text
detector is firstly used to predict initial segmentation results. Then, we
propose a context-aware module to enhance text kernel feature representations,
which considers both global and local contexts. Finally, we introduce a
boundary-guided module to expand enhanced text kernels adaptively with only the
pixels on the contours, which not only obtains accurate text boundaries but
also keeps high speed, especially on high-resolution output maps. In
particular, with a lightweight backbone, the basic detector equipped with our

(SAF), with a finite interlayer coupling. Due to the opposite gyrovector of the
skyrmions in the two SAF layers, the coupled skyrmions reach a stationary
regime with a spatial separation, in a direction orthogonal to their velocity.
As a consequence, and contrary to the ferromagnetic situation, a transient
regime necessarily occurs, with a finite acceleration, related to an inertia,
and that limits its time response. The formalism developed here, based on two
coupled Thiele equations, allows a quantitative description of this phenomenon.
The time constant associated to the transient regime scales inversely with the
antiferromagnetic coupling constant. We also show that the coupling force
reaches a maximal value at a finite skyrmion separation. This sets a maximum
velocity limit, beyond which the the coupling force cannot stabilize the bound
state.

challenging problem of audio-driven co-speech gesture video generation, i.e.,
using a unified framework to generate speaker image sequence driven by speech

common motion patterns and subtle rhythmic dynamics. To this end, we propose a
novel framework, Audio-driveN Gesture vIdeo gEneration (ANGIE), to effectively

substrate. High-order harmonics up to the 19th order are generated by the
interaction with an ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) driving laser. We find that
the generation is sensitive to the number of layers and their relative
orientation. For AAAA stacking configuration, both odd- and even-orders exhibit
a quadratic increase in intensity as a function of the number of layers, which
is a signature of constructive interference of high-harmonic emission from
successive layers. Particularly, we observe some deviations from this scaling
at photon energies above the bandgap, which is explained by self-absorption
effects. For AB and ABAB stacking, even-order harmonics remain below the
detection level, consistent with the presence of inversion symmetry. Our study
confirms the capability of producing non-perturbative high-order harmonics from
stacked layered materials subjected to intense MIR fields without damaging
samples. It has implications for optimizing solid-state HHG sources at the
nano-scale and developing high-harmonics as an ultrafast probe of artificially
stacked layered materials. Because the HHG process is a strong-field driven
process, it has the potential to probe high-momentum and energy states in the
bandstructure combined with atomic-scale sensitivity in real space, making it
an attractive probe of novel material structures such as the Moir\'e pattern.

scatterings beneath the superconducting dome of noncentrosymmetric nodal-line
superconductors. With the application of renormalization group, several
interesting low-energy behaviors are extracted from the coupled equations of
all interaction parameters. At the clean limit, fermion-fermion interactions
decrease with lowering the energy scales but conversely fermion velocities
climb up and approach certain saturated values. This yields a slight decrease
or increase of the anisotropy of fermion velocities depending upon their
initial ratio. After bringing out four kinds of disorders designated by the
random charge ($\Delta_{1}$), random mass ($\Delta_{2}$), random axial chemical
potential ($\Delta_{3}$), and spin-orbit scatterers ($\Delta_{4}$) based on
their own unique features, we begin with presenting the distinct low-energy
fates of these disorders. For the presence of sole disorder, its strength
becomes either relevant ($\Delta_{1,4}$) or irrelevant($\Delta_{2,3}$) in the
low-energy regime. However, the competition for multiple sorts of disorders is
capable of qualitatively reshaping the low-energy properties of disorders
$\Delta_{2,3,4}$. Besides, it can generate an initially absent disorder as long
as two of $\Delta_{1,2,3}$ are present. In addition, the fermion-fermion
couplings are insensitive to the presence of $\Delta_4$ but rather
substantially modified by $\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$, or $\Delta_3$, and evolve
towards zero or certain finite non-zero values under the coexistence of
distinct disorders. Furthermore, the fermion velocities flow towards certain
finite saturated value for the only presence of $\Delta_{2,3}$ and vanish for
all other situations. As to their ratio, it acquires a little increase once the
disorder is subordinate to fermionic interactions, otherwise keeps some fixed
constant.

photon budget. Aim. This paper investigates the geometric limiting precision,
in terms of CCD pixel fraction, achieved by a large set of star field images,
selected among the publicly available science data of the TESS mission. Method.
The statistics of the distance between selected bright stars ($G \simeq
5\,mag$), in pixel units, is evaluated, using the position estimate provided in
the TESS light curve files. Results. The dispersion of coordinate differences
appears to be affected by long term variation and noisy periods, at the level
of $0.01$ pixel. The residuals with respect to low-pass filtered data (tracing
the secular evolution), which are interpreted as the experimental astrometric
noise, reach the level of a few milli-pixel or below, down to $1/5,900$ pixel.
Saturated images are present, evidencing that the astrometric precision is
mostly preserved across the CCD columns, whereas it features a graceful
degradation in the along column direction. The cumulative performance of the
image set is a few micro-pixel across columns, or a few 10 micro-pixel along
columns. Conclusions. The idea of astrometric precision down to a small
fraction of a CCD pixel, given sufficient signal to noise ratio, is confirmed
by real data from an in-flight science instrument to the $10^{-6}$ pixel level.
Implications for future high precision astrometry missions are briefly
discussed.

  in Graph Neural Networks","Preprint under review",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied in many
applications in computer sciences. Despite the success of deep learning
architectures in other domains, deep GNNs still underperform their shallow
counterparts. There are many open questions about deep GNNs, but over-smoothing
and over-squashing are perhaps the most intriguing issues. When stacking
multiple graph convolutional layers, the over-smoothing and over-squashing
problems arise and have been defined as the inability of GNNs to learn deep
representations and propagate information from distant nodes, respectively.
Even though the widespread definitions of both problems are similar, these
phenomena have been studied independently. This work strives to understand the
underlying relationship between over-smoothing and over-squashing from a
topological perspective. We show that both problems are intrinsically related
to the spectral gap of the Laplacian of the graph. Therefore, there is a
trade-off between these two problems, i.e., we cannot simultaneously alleviate
both over-smoothing and over-squashing. We also propose a Stochastic Jost and
Liu curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm based on a bound of the Ollivier's

reconstructing the 3D scene. As NeRF emerges, subsequent studies have been
conducted to model dynamic scenes, which include motions or topological
changes. However, most of them use an additional deformation network, slowing
down the training and rendering speed. Tensorial radiance field (TensoRF)
recently shows its potential for fast, high-quality reconstruction of static
scenes with compact model size. In this paper, we present D-TensoRF, a
tensorial radiance field for dynamic scenes, enabling novel view synthesis at a
specific time. We consider the radiance field of a dynamic scene as a 5D
tensor. The 5D tensor represents a 4D grid in which each axis corresponds to X,
Y, Z, and time and has 1D multi-channel features per element. Similar to
TensoRF, we decompose the grid either into rank-one vector components (CP
decomposition) or low-rank matrix components (newly proposed MM decomposition).
We also use smoothing regularization to reflect the relationship between
features at different times (temporal dependency). We conduct extensive
evaluations to analyze our models. We show that D-TensoRF with CP decomposition
and MM decomposition both have short training times and significantly low
memory footprints with quantitatively and qualitatively competitive rendering
results in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods in 3D dynamic scene
modeling.

due to its foundational role in many emerging multi-agent learning paradigms
(e.g., multi-agent meta-learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning) over
peer-to-peer edge networks. However, to work with the limited computation and
communication capabilities of edge networks, a major challenge in developing
decentralized bilevel optimization techniques is to lower sample and
communication complexities. This motivates us to develop a new decentralized
bilevel optimization called DIAMOND (decentralized single-timescale stochastic
approximation with momentum and gradient-tracking). The contributions of this
paper are as follows: i) our DIAMOND algorithm adopts a single-loop structure
rather than following the natural double-loop structure of bilevel
optimization, which offers low computation and implementation complexity; ii)
compared to existing approaches, the DIAMOND algorithm does not require any
full gradient evaluations, which further reduces both sample and computational
complexities; iii) through a careful integration of momentum information and
gradient tracking techniques, we show that the DIAMOND algorithm enjoys
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ in sample and communication complexities for
achieving an $\epsilon$-stationary solution, both of which are independent of
the dataset sizes and significantly outperform existing works. Extensive
experiments also verify our theoretical findings.

recently, especially with the ubiquitous use of deep neural networks in the
current landscape. Adversarial attacks and defenses are usually likened to a
cat-and-mouse game in which defenders and attackers evolve over the time. On
one hand, the goal is to develop strong and robust deep networks that are
resistant to malicious actors. On the other hand, in order to achieve that, we
need to devise even stronger adversarial attacks to challenge these defense
models. Most of existing attacks employs a single $\ell_p$ distance (commonly,
$p\in\{1,2,\infty\}$) to define the concept of closeness and performs steepest
gradient ascent w.r.t. this $p$-norm to update all pixels in an adversarial
example in the same way. These $\ell_p$ attacks each has its own pros and cons;
and there is no single attack that can successfully break through defense
models that are robust against multiple $\ell_p$ norms simultaneously.
Motivated by these observations, we come up with a natural approach: combining
various $\ell_p$ gradient projections on a pixel level to achieve a joint
adversarial perturbation. Specifically, we learn how to perturb each pixel to
maximize the attack performance, while maintaining the overall visual
imperceptibility of adversarial examples. Finally, through various experiments
with standardized benchmarks, we show that our method outperforms most current
strong attacks across state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, while retaining its
ability to remain clean visually.

forward-incubation-time epidemic model, which is a mixture of an
incubation-period distribution and a forward time distribution, to model the
collected duration times and to estimate the incubation-period distribution of
COVID-19. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the
identifiability of the unknown parameters in the mixture
forward-incubation-time epidemic model when the incubation period follows a
two-parameter distribution. Under the same setup, we propose a likelihood ratio
test (LRT) for testing the null hypothesis that the mixture
forward-incubation-time epidemic model is a homogeneous exponential
distribution. The testing problem is non-regular because a nuisance parameter
is present only under the alternative. We establish the limiting distribution

distribution of the LRT under a sequence of local alternatives is also
obtained. Our simulation results indicate that the LRT has desirable type I
errors and powers, and we analyze a COVID-19 outbreak dataset from China to
illustrate the usefulness of the LRT.

This gap occurs due to the violation of the fundamental assumption that the

real-world scenarios where collecting data from all possible domains for
training is costly and even impossible, the i.i.d assumption can hardly be
satisfied. The problem is even more severe in the case of medical images and

  Continuance Intentions: A Literature Review and Framework",,,,,"cs.HC cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Information systems (IS) adoption and continuance intentions of users have a
dominant effect on digital transformation in organisations. However,
organisations undergoing digital transformation face substantial barriers due
to user resistance to IS implementations. Status quo bias (SQB) plays a vital
role in users decision-making regarding adopting new IS or continuing to use
existing IS. Despite recent research to validate the effects of SQB on user
resistance to IS implementations, how SQB affects the IS adoption and
continuance intentions of users remains poorly understood, making it harder to
develop ways of successfully dealing with it. To address the gap, we performed
a systematic literature review on SQB in IS research. Our proposed framework
incorporates the psychological phenomena promoting the status quo, SQB theory
constructs, levels of SQB influence, and factors reducing the user resistance
to IS implementations to enhance the understanding of IS adoption and
continuance intentions.

the perimeter functional. However, by the work of Michor and Mumford [7,8], the
formal Riemannian structure that is compatible with the gradient flow structure
induces a degenerate metric on the space of hypersurfaces. It is then natural
to ask whether there is a nondegenerate metric space of hypersurfaces, on which
the mean curvature flow admits a gradient flow structure. In this paper we
study the mean curvature flow on two nondegenerate metric spaces of simple
closed plane curves: the uniformness-preserving metric structure proposed by
Shi and Vorotnikov [11] and the curvature-weighted structure proposed by Michor

  Interaction Mechanism in DuerOS","Accepted by CIKM-22",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, spoken dialogue systems have been widely deployed in a variety of
applications, serving a huge number of end-users. A common issue is that the
errors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of
knowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading
to an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a
proactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction
with the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not
likely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the
user a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of
providing the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the
system can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the
user satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale
commercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus
can hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations
and temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they
are trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which
are expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these
challenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help
DuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we
propose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a
transformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak
labels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a
19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and
2.3% relative improvement on user experience.

  Air-to-Air Combat",,,,,"cs.AI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) combat is a challenging scenario with
continuous action space. In this paper, we propose a general hierarchical
framework to resolve the within-vision-range (WVR) air-to-air combat problem
under 6 dimensions of degree (6-DOF) dynamics. The core idea is to divide the
whole decision process into two loops and use reinforcement learning (RL) to
solve them separately. The outer loop takes into account the current combat
situation and decides the expected macro behavior of the aircraft according to
a combat strategy. Then the inner loop tracks the macro behavior with a flight
controller by calculating the actual input signals for the aircraft. We design
the Markov decision process for both the outer loop strategy and inner loop
controller, and train them by proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. For
the inner loop controller, we design an effective reward function to accurately
track various macro behavior. For the outer loop strategy, we further adopt a
fictitious self-play mechanism to improve the combat performance by constantly
combating against the historical strategies. Experiment results show that the
inner loop controller can achieve better tracking performance than fine-tuned
PID controller, and the outer loop strategy can perform complex maneuvers to
get higher and higher winning rate, with the generation evolves.

Land subsidence has a significant impact on infrastructure resilience and

with underlying geological composition. Then, we aim to remotely estimate
geologic composition using interferometric synthetic aperture radar
(InSAR)-based land deformation temporal changes using machine learning
techniques. We identified regions with different temporal characteristics of
land displacement in that some areas (e.g., Helm) with coarser grain geologic
compositions exhibited potentially reversible land deformation (elastic land
compaction). We found a significant correlation between InSAR-based land
deformation and geologic composition using random forest and deep neural
network regression models. We also achieved significant accuracy with 1/4
sparse sampling to reduce any spatial correlations among data, suggesting that
the model has the potential to be generalized to other regions for indirect
estimation of geologic composition. Our results indicate that geologic
composition can be estimated using InSAR-based land deformation data. In-situ
measurements of geologic composition can be expensive and time consuming and
may be impractical in some areas. The generalizability of the model sheds light
on high spatial resolution geologic composition estimation utilizing existing
measurements.

segments, such a paradigm needs to couple the learning of the matching
operations with heavy segmentation modules, limiting the flexibility of design
and increasing the learning complexity. To alleviate this issue, we propose
Mask Matching Transformer (MM-Former), a new paradigm for the few-shot

segmenter to decompose the query image into multiple segment proposals. Then, a
simple matching mechanism is applied to merge the related segment proposals
into the final mask guided by the support images. The advantages of our
MM-Former are two-fold. First, the MM-Former follows the paradigm of decompose
first and then blend, allowing our method to benefit from the advanced
potential objects segmenter to produce high-quality mask proposals for query
images. Second, the mission of prototypical features is relaxed to learn
coefficients to fuse correct ones within a proposal pool, making the MM-Former
be well generalized to complex scenarios or cases. We conduct extensive
