nonlinear dynamics into a sum of nonlinear functions of the state space with
purely exponential and sinusoidal time dependence. For a limited number of
dynamical systems, it is possible to find these Koopman eigenfunctions exactly
and analytically. Here, this is done for the Korteweg-de Vries equation on a
periodic interval, using the periodic inverse scattering transform and some
concepts of algebraic geometry. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
complete Koopman analysis of a partial differential equation which does not
have a trivial global attractor. The results are shown to match the frequencies
computed by the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). We
demonstrate that in general DMD gives a large number of eigenvalues near the
imaginary axis, and show how these should be interpretted in this setting.

the abinitio no-core shell model employing interactions derived from chiral
effective field theory to calculate the two-body decay rate

${}_\Lambda^3\mathrm{H}$ and from $\pi^- -{}^3\mathrm{He}$ final-state

inclusive $\pi^-$ decay rate $\Gamma_{\pi^-}({}_\Lambda^3\mathrm{H})$ by using
the measured branching ratio
$\Gamma({}_\Lambda^3\mathrm{H}\to{}^3\mathrm{He}+\pi^-)/\Gamma_{\pi^-}({}_\Lambda^3\mathrm{H})$

The resulting $\tau({}_\Lambda^3\mathrm{H})$ varies strongly with the rather

string theory to describe the maximal helicity violating (MHV) sector of

NodeModel, at each time step $t\ge 0$, a random node $u$ and a random sample of
$k$ of its neighbours $v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_k$ are selected. Then, $u$ updates its
current value $\xi_u(t)$ to $\xi_u(t+1) = \alpha \xi_u(t) +
\frac{(1-\alpha)}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \xi_{v_i}(t)$, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and
$k\ge 1$ are parameters of the process. In the second process, the EdgeModel,
at each step a random pair of adjacent nodes $(u,v)$ is selected, and then node
$u$ updates its value equivalently to the NodeModel with $k=1$ and $v$ as the
selected neighbour. For both processes, the values of all nodes converge to
$F$, a random variable depending on the random choices made in each step. For
the NodeModel and regular graphs, and for the EdgeModel and arbitrary graphs,
the expectation of $F$ is the average of the initial values
$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{u\in V} \xi_u(0)$. For the NodeModel and non-regular graphs,
the expectation of $F$ is the degree-weighted average of the initial values.
Our results are two-fold. We consider the concentration of $F$ and show tight
bounds on the variance of $F$ for regular graphs. We show that, when the
initial values do not depend on the number of nodes, then the variance is
negligible, hence the nodes are able to estimate the initial average of the
node values. Interestingly, this variance does not depend on the graph
structure. For the proof we introduce a duality between our processes and a
process of two correlated random walks. We also analyse the convergence time
for both models and for arbitrary graphs, showing bounds on the time
$T_\varepsilon$ required to make all node values `$\varepsilon$-close' to each
other. Our bounds are asymptotically tight under assumptions on the
distribution of the initial values.

and attracted increasing attention in autonomous driving. Recent works mainly
focus on improving efficiency or accuracy but neglect the domain shift problem,
resulting in severe degradation of transfer performance. With extensive
observations, we figure out the significant domain gaps existing in the scene,
weather, and day-night changing scenarios and make the first attempt to solve
the domain adaption problem for multi-view 3D object detection. Since BEV
perception approaches are usually complicated and contain several components,
the domain shift accumulation on multi-latent spaces makes BEV domain
adaptation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level
Multi-space Alignment Teacher-Student ($M^{2}ATS$) framework to ease the domain
shift accumulation, which consists of a Depth-Aware Teacher (DAT) and a
Multi-space Feature Aligned (MFA) student model. Specifically, DAT model adopts
uncertainty guidance to sample reliable depth information in target domain.
After constructing domain-invariant BEV perception, it then transfers pixel and
instance-level knowledge to student model. To further alleviate the domain
shift at the global level, MFA student model is introduced to align
task-relevant multi-space features of two domains. To verify the effectiveness
of $M^{2}ATS$, we conduct BEV 3D object detection experiments on four cross
domain scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance (e.g., +12.6% NDS and
+9.1% mAP on Day-Night). Code and dataset will be released.

However, maximizing nonmonotone submodular function with complex constraints is

additional layer of complexity. So far, few studies have been devoted to
proposing effective solutions, making this problem currently unclear. In this

approximation solution. Then we develop the proof machinery that shows our
algorithm is a bi-criterion approximation algorithm: it can achieve a
constant-factor approximation to the optimal algorithm, while keeping the
over-budget tightly bounded. We also explore practical considerations of
achieving a trade-off between time complexity and over-budget. Finally, we
conduct numeric experiments on two concrete examples, and show our design's

often only in reach of large research labs. One way of making pretraining
cheaper is the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) task, by providing more signal
during training, since the loss can be computed over all tokens. In this work,
we train Longformer models with the efficient RTD task on legal data to
showcase that pretraining efficient LMs is possible using much less compute. We
evaluate the trained models on challenging summarization tasks requiring the
model to summarize long texts to show to what extent the models can achieve
good performance on downstream tasks. We find that both the small and base
models outperform their baselines on the in-domain BillSum and out-of-domain
PubMed tasks in their respective parameter range. We publish our code and

changes of the electronic system over the course of the pulse duration and the
overall absorption of the pulse becomes fluence-dependent. Thus,
fluence-dependent non-linear X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) is
sensitive to the valence excitation dynamics around the Fermi level on the
few-femtosecond timescale. Here we present a simplified rate model based on
well-established physical mechanisms to describe the evolution of the

processes of resonant absorption, stimulated emission, non-resonant absorption,
Auger decay, valence band thermalization and scattering cascades of free
electrons. The phenomenological rate model approach provides a direct
understanding how each physical process contributes to the fluence-dependent
changes observed in XANES measurements. Without accounting for
fluence-dependent changes to the density of states, the model shows good
agreement with experimental results on metallic nickel over more than three
orders of magnitude in fluence, establishing electron redistribution as the
main driver of non-linear absorption changes at high fluences. Although in the
closest vicinity of the resonance, more complex approaches are necessary to
describe remaining discrepancies of the fluence-dependence changes, the
demonstrated capability to describe spectral changes up to extreme fluences
yields fundamental insights into the complex dynamics after intense core

show, using WKB analysis, that the position of the shell sets the real part of
the broad resonances while its energy-momentum and the discontinuity of the
potential at the shell's surface set their imaginary part. Next, we provide the
complex angular momentum representation of the differential scattering cross

Applied several times to two-point sets, this result implies that any subset of

  However, generally, such `embeddings' result in very inefficient bounds on
the aforementioned $\epsilon$. In this paper, we present another way of
combining exponentially Ramsey sets, which gives much better estimates in some
important cases. In particular, we show that the chromatic number of $\mathbb

previous constant $1.0144$. We also obtain similar strong results for regular
simplices of larger dimensions, as well as for related geometric Ramsey-type
questions in Manhattan norm.
  We then show that the same technique implies several interesting corollaries
in other combinatorial problems. In particular, we give an explicit upper bound
on the size of a family $\mathcal F\subset2^{[n]}$ that contains no weak
$k$-sunflowers, i.e. no collection of $k$ sets with pairwise intersections of
the same size. This bound improves upon previously known results for all
$k\ge4$. Finally, we also present a simple deduction of the (other) celebrated

of the Walecka-type models, must be an invariant under SU(3) and SU(6) group
transformations. The coupling constants of the baryon with the scalar $\sigma$
meson are fixed to reproduce the known potential depths for the hyperons and
$\Delta$ resonances, in an approach that can be extended to all particles. We
then apply the calculated coupling constants to study neutron star matter with
hyperons and deltas admixed to its composition. We conclude that the $\Delta^-$
is by far the most important exotic particle that can be present in the neutron
star interior. It is always present, independent of the chosen
parameterization, and might appear in almost every known neutron star, once its
onset happens at very low density. Yet, its presence affects the astrophysical
properties of the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$ star, and, in some cases, it can even
contribute to an increase in the maximum mass reached.

consider general Polish spaces with a general metric, which are allowed to be

the new estimators achieve exponential concentration under only a second moment

dynamically divided between `heavier' leaders, expected to approach local

assume the role of `heavy' swarm leaders and so on. Convergence analysis and

feature representations with higher inter-class and lower intra-class
variations, with a mere few labelled samples. Conventional few-shot learning
methods however cannot be naively adopted for this fine-grained setting -- a
quick pilot study reveals that they in fact push for the opposite (i.e., lower
inter-class variations and higher intra-class variations). To alleviate this
problem, prior works predominately use a support set to reconstruct the query
image and then utilize metric learning to determine its category. Upon careful
inspection, we further reveal that such unidirectional reconstruction methods
only help to increase inter-class variations and are not effective in tackling
intra-class variations. In this paper, we for the first time introduce a
bi-reconstruction mechanism that can simultaneously accommodate for inter-class
and intra-class variations. In addition to using the support set to reconstruct
the query set for increasing inter-class variations, we further use the query
set to reconstruct the support set for reducing intra-class variations. This
design effectively helps the model to explore more subtle and discriminative
features which is key for the fine-grained problem in hand. Furthermore, we
also construct a self-reconstruction module to work alongside the
bi-directional module to make the features even more discriminative.

exceptionally low degree of polytypism for interwire separations exceeding a

excitation density for both steady-state and pulsed excitation to identify the
nature of the recombination channels. An abrupt Mott transition from excitonic
to electron-hole-plasma recombination is observed, and the corresponding Mott
density is derived. Combining these experiments with simulations and additional
direct measurements of the external quantum efficiency using a perfect diffuse

efficiency of the nanowire array. The results vividly document the high

  Ad-hoc Neighbor Selection",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep semantic matching aims to discriminate the relationship between
documents based on deep neural networks. In recent years, it becomes
increasingly popular to organize documents with a graph structure, then
leverage both the intrinsic document features and the extrinsic neighbor
features to derive discrimination. Most of the existing works mainly care about
how to utilize the presented neighbors, whereas limited effort is made to
filter appropriate neighbors. We argue that the neighbor features could be
highly noisy and partially useful. Thus, a lack of effective neighbor selection
will not only incur a great deal of unnecessary computation cost, but also
restrict the matching accuracy severely.
  In this work, we propose a novel framework, Cascaded Deep Semantic Matching
(CDSM), for accurate and efficient semantic matching on textual graphs. CDSM is
highlighted for its two-stage workflow. In the first stage, a lightweight
CNN-based ad-hod neighbor selector is deployed to filter useful neighbors for
the matching task with a small computation cost. We design both one-step and
multi-step selection methods. In the second stage, a high-capacity graph-based
matching network is employed to compute fine-grained relevance scores based on
the well-selected neighbors. It is worth noting that CDSM is a generic
framework which accommodates most of the mainstream graph-based semantic
matching networks. The major challenge is how the selector can learn to
discriminate the neighbors usefulness which has no explicit labels. To cope
with this problem, we design a weak-supervision strategy for optimization,
where we train the graph-based matching network at first and then the ad-hoc
neighbor selector is learned on top of the annotations from the matching
network.

often face challenges when being applied to modern model architectures

Firstly, the high flexibility of rule-based XAI methods leads to numerous
potential parameterizations. Secondly, many XAI methods break the
implementation-invariance axiom because they struggle with certain model
components, e.g., BatchNorm layers. The latter can be addressed with model
canonization, which is the process of re-structuring the model to disregard
problematic components without changing the underlying function. While model
canonization is straightforward for simple architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet),
it can be challenging for more complex and highly interconnected models (e.g.,
DenseNet). Moreover, there is only little quantifiable evidence that model
canonization is beneficial for XAI. In this work, we propose canonizations for
currently relevant model blocks applicable to popular deep neural network
architectures,including VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNets, as well as
Relation Networks. We further suggest a XAI evaluation framework with which we

distribution as the dimension of the matrix tends to infinity. While the
largest diagonal entry is also shown to have Gumbel fluctuations, there is a
rather surprising difference between its deterministic centering term and the
centering term required for the largest eigenvalue.

promising results in representing time series and nonlinear dynamic systems.
Although they are equipped with a very efficient training procedure, Reservoir
Computing strategies, such as the ESN, require high-order networks, i.e., many
neurons, resulting in a large number of states that are magnitudes higher than
the number of model inputs and outputs. A large number of states not only makes
the time-step computation more costly but also may pose robustness issues,
especially when applying ESNs to problems such as Model Predictive Control
(MPC) and other optimal control problems. One way to circumvent this complexity
issue is through Model Order Reduction strategies such as the Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) and its variants (POD-DEIM), whereby we find an equivalent
lower order representation to an already trained high dimension ESN. To this
end, this work aims to investigate and analyze the performance of POD methods
in Echo State Networks, evaluating their effectiveness through the Memory

ESN. We also perform experiments on two numerical case studies: a NARMA10

results show that there is little loss of performance comparing the original

tends to be superior to a normal ESN of the same size. Also, the POD-reduced

find that after training, we are able to linearize a significant number of

modeled as problems where agents are matched to resources over multiple rounds.
Agents' requirements limit the set of compatible resources and the rounds in
which they want to be matched. Viewing such an application as a multi-round
matching problem on a bipartite compatibility graph between agents and
resources, we show that a solution (i.e., a set of matchings, with one matching
per round) can be found efficiently if one exists. To cope with situations
where a solution does not exist, we consider two extensions. In the first
extension, a benefit function is defined for each agent and the objective is to
find a multi-round matching to maximize the total benefit. For a general class
of benefit functions satisfying certain properties (including diminishing
returns), we show that this multi-round matching problem is efficiently
solvable. This class includes utilitarian and Rawlsian welfare functions. For
another benefit function, we show that the maximization problem is NP-hard. In
the second extension, the objective is to generate advice to each agent (i.e.,
a subset of requirements to be relaxed) subject to a budget constraint so that
the agent can be matched. We show that this budget-constrained advice
generation problem is NP-hard. For this problem, we develop an integer linear

  Exploiting a Calibrated External Microphone Array","Submitted to ICASSP 2023",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, a relative transfer function (RTF)-vector-based method has been
proposed to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a target speaker for a
binaural hearing aid setup, assuming the availability of external microphones.
This method exploits the external microphones to estimate the RTF vector
corresponding to the binaural hearing aid and constructs a one-dimensional
spatial spectrum by comparing the estimated RTF vector against a database of
anechoic prototype RTF vectors for several directions. In this paper we assume
the availability of a calibrated array of external microphones, which is
characterized by a second database of anechoic prototype RTF vectors. We
propose a method, where the external microphones are not only exploited to
estimate the RTF vector corresponding to the binaural hearing aid but also
assist in estimating the DOA of the target speaker. Based on the estimated RTF
vector for all microphones and both prototype databases, a two-dimensional
spatial spectrum is constructed from which the DOA is estimated. Experimental
results for a reverberant environment with diffuse-like noise show that
assisted DOA estimation outperforms DOA estimation where the prototype database
characterizing the array of external microphones is not used.

for an extended time and then to release them on demand. This can be achieved
in atomic frequency comb ensemble based quantum memories by control pulses that
transfer the excitation to and from long-lived spin states. However, such
pulses can give rise to coherent and incoherent noise due to their interaction
with the memory ensemble. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate the
ability to switch off the coherent noise from such control pulses during the
echo emission in a spin-wave quantum memory, using the linear Stark effect in
rare-earth-ion doped crystals. By applying an electric field pulse, the echo
emission was coherently switched off prior to the first spin transfer pulse,
and the stored data pulse was restored only when both an optical recall pulse
and a re-phasing electrical pulse were applied, giving a high degree of control
of both desired and undesired emissions. We estimate the effectiveness of this
technique by turning off the free induction decay of a narrow ensemble of ions.
This technique can thus improve the noise performance of spin-wave storage at
the single photon level by quenching coherent optical radiation created by the
strong control pulses. The method demonstrated here represents a
proof-of-principle that the spin-wave storage scheme can be combined with Stark
control. The combined scheme serves as an addition to the toolbox of techniques
that can be used to realize a full version of a quantum repeater.

polarization from photo-excited electron-hole pairs to free charge carriers in
twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers. For small twist angles, the valley
lifetimes of the charge carriers are surprisingly short, despite the occurrence
of interlayer excitons with their presumably long recombination and
polarization lifetimes. For large twist angles, we measure an increase in both
the valley polarization and its respective lifetime by more than two orders of
magnitude. Interestingly, in such heterobilayers we observe an interlayer
transfer of valley polarization from the WSe$_2$ layer into the MoSe$_2$ layer.
This mechanism enables the creation of a photo-induced valley polarization of
free charge carriers in MoSe$_2$, which amplitude scales with the gate-induced
charge carrier density. This is in contrast to monolayer MoSe$_2$, where such a
gate-tunable valley polarization cannot be achieved. By combining time-resolved
Kerr rotation, photoluminesence and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy

of a Boolean function to the communication complexity of an associated `lifted'
function obtained by composing the function with many copies of another
function known as a gadget, have been instrumental in resolving many open
questions in computational complexity. Several important complexity questions
could be resolved if we could make substantial improvements in the input size
required for lifting with the Index function, from its current near-linear size
down to polylogarithmic in the number of inputs $N$ of the original function
or, ideally, constant. The near-linear size bound was shown by Lovett, Meka,
Mertz, Pitassi and Zhang using a recent breakthrough improvement on the
Sunflower Lemma to show that a certain graph associated with the Index function
of near-linear size is a disperser. They also stated a conjecture about the
Index function that is essential for further improvements in the size required
for lifting with Index using current techniques. In this paper we prove the
following;
  1) The conjecture of Lovett et al. is false when the size of the Index gadget
is $\log N-\omega(1)$.
  2) Also, the Inner-Product function, which satisfies the disperser property
at size $O(\log N)$, does not have this property when its size is $\log
N-\omega(1)$.
  3) Nonetheless, using Index gadgets of size at least 4, we prove a lifting
theorem for a restricted class of communication protocols in which one of the
players is limited to sending parities of its inputs.
  4) Using the ideas from this lifting theorem, we derive a strong lifting
theorem from decision tree size to parity decision tree size. We use this to
derive a general lifting theorem in proof complexity from tree-resolution size
to tree-like $Res(\oplus)$ refutation size, which yields many new exponential
lower bounds on such proofs.

investigate the Hubble ($H(z)$), dark energy equation of state ($\omega_{DE}$),
effective equation of state ($\omega_{eff}$), and deceleration ($q$)

in good consistent with respect to observation. Also, it can reveal the turning
point for both noninteracting and nonlinear interacting THDE with Ricci cutoff
in the late time era. Next, the analysis of the $\omega_{DE}$ for our models
displays that the dark energy can experience the phantom state at the current
time. However, it lies in the quintessence regime in the early era and
approaches the cosmological constant in the late-time epoch. Similar results
will be for the $\omega_{eff}$ parameter with this difference that the
$\omega_{eff}$ will experience the quintessence region at the current redshift.
Next to the mentioned parameters, the study of the $q$ parameter indicates that
the models satisfy an acceptable transition phase from the matter to the dark
energy-dominated era. After that, the classical stability ($v_{s}^{2}$) will be
analyzed for our models. The $v_{s}^{2}$ shows that the noninteracting and

unstable in the present, and progressive epochs. Then, we will employ the

To evaluate the quality of label placement, a quality function is defined based
on four quality metrics, label-feature conflict, label-label conflict, label
ambiguity factor, and label position priority for points and polygons.
Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly reduced
the overall score of the quality function and the computational time of label

the problem of how to enable a software system to deal with uncertain operating
conditions. One prominent solution to this problem is self-adaptation, which
equips a software system with a feedback loop that resolves uncertainties
during operation and adapts the system to deal with them when necessary. Most
self-adaptation approaches developed so far use decision-making mechanisms that
focus on achieving a set of goals, i.e., that select for execution the
adaptation option with the best estimated benefit. A few approaches have also
considered the estimated (one-off) cost of executing the candidate adaptation
options. We argue that besides benefit and cost, decision-making in
self-adaptive systems should also consider the estimated risk the system or its
users would be exposed to if an adaptation option were selected for execution.
Balancing all three factors when evaluating the options for adaptation when
mitigating uncertainty is essential, not only for satisfying the concerns of
the stakeholders, but also to ensure safety and public acceptance of
self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we present an ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010
compatible architectural viewpoint that considers the estimated benefit, cost,
and risk as core factors of each adaptation option considered in
self-adaptation. The viewpoint aims to support software architects responsible
for designing robust decision-making mechanisms for self-adaptive systems.

numerous advantages, simple PCs suffer from several problems: detectability,
and therefore abundance, is unknown; systematic spatiotemporal variation in
detectability produces biased inferences, and unknown survey area prevents
formal density estimation and scaling-up to the landscape level. We introduce
integrated distance sampling (IDS) models that combine distance sampling (DS)
with simple PC or detection/nondetection (DND) data and capitalize on the
strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of each data type. Key to IDS models is
the view of simple PC and DND data as aggregations of latent DS surveys that
observe the same underlying density process. This enables estimation of
separate detection functions, along with distinct covariate effects, for all
data types. Additional information from repeat or time-removal surveys, or
variable survey duration, enables separate estimation of the availability and
perceptibility components of detectability. IDS models reconcile spatial and
temporal mismatches among data sets and solve the above-mentioned problems of
simple PC and DND data. To fit IDS models, we provide JAGS code and the new
IDS() function in the R package unmarked. Extant citizen-science data generally
lack adjustments for detection biases, but IDS models address this shortcoming,
thus greatly extending the utility and reach of these data. In addition, they
enable formal density estimation in hybrid designs, which efficiently combine
distance sampling with distance-free, point-based PC or DND surveys. We believe
that IDS models have considerable scope in ecology, management, and monitoring.

treat it as simple image-to-image translation, without consideration for the
semantics of the scene and the objects within it. In contrast, humans and
animals have been shown to use higher-level information to solve MDE: prior
knowledge of the nature of the objects in the scene, their positions and likely

shown to help resolve this ambiguity.
  In this paper, we present a novel method to enhance MDE performance by
encouraging use of known-useful information about the semantics of objects and
inter-object relationships within a scene. Our novel ObjCAViT module sources
world-knowledge from language models and learns inter-object relationships in
the context of the MDE problem using transformer attention, incorporating

Inaccurate localization and tracking of particles is a key source of error in
PTV, especially for single camera defocusing, plenoptic imaging, and digital
in-line holography (DIH) sensors. To address this issue, we developed
stochastic particle advection velocimetry (SPAV): a statistical data loss that
improves the accuracy of PTV. SPAV is based on an explicit particle advection
model that predicts particle positions over time as a function of the estimated
velocity field. The model can account for non-ideal effects like drag on
inertial particles. A statistical data loss that compares the tracked and
advected particle positions, accounting for arbitrary localization and tracking
uncertainties, is derived and approximated. We implement our approach using a
physics-informed neural network, which simultaneously minimizes the SPAV data
loss, a Navier-Stokes physics loss, and a wall boundary loss, where
appropriate. Results are reported for simulated and experimental DIH-PTV
measurements of laminar and turbulent flows. Our statistical approach
significantly improves the accuracy of PTV reconstructions compared to a
conventional data loss, resulting in an average reduction of error close to
50%. Furthermore, our framework can be readily adapted to work with other data

Nevertheless, once a model has been adversarially trained, one often desires a
certification that the model is truly robust against all future attacks.
Unfortunately, when faced with adversarially trained models, all existing
approaches have significant trouble making certifications that are strong
enough to be practically useful. Linear programming (LP) techniques in
particular face a ""convex relaxation barrier"" that prevent them from making
high-quality certifications, even after refinement with mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) techniques, and even when using state-of-the-art
computational facilities. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex certification
technique, based on a low-rank restriction of a semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation. The nonconvex relaxation makes strong certifications comparable to
much more expensive SDP methods, while optimizing over dramatically fewer
variables comparable to much weaker LP methods. Despite nonconvexity, we show
how off-the-shelf local optimization algorithms can be used to achieve and to

the main challenges of neural network inference on an MCU is the extremely
limited amount of read-write on-chip memory (SRAM, < 512 kB). SRAM is consumed
by the neural network layer (operator) input and output buffers, which,
traditionally, must be in memory (materialised) for an operator to execute. We
discuss a novel execution paradigm for microcontroller deep learning, which
modifies the execution of neural networks to avoid materialising full buffers
in memory, drastically reducing SRAM usage with no computation overhead. This
is achieved by exploiting the properties of operators, which can
consume/produce a fraction of their input/output at a time. We describe a
partial execution compiler, Pex, which produces memory-efficient execution
schedules automatically by identifying subgraphs of operators whose execution
can be split along the feature (""channel"") dimension. Memory usage is reduced
further by targeting memory bottlenecks with structured pruning, leading to the
co-design of the network architecture and its execution schedule. Our

applications is the requirement of a large number of system interactions to
learn a good control policy. Off-policy and Offline RL methods have been
proposed to reduce the number of interactions with the physical environment by
learning control policies from historical data. However, their performances
suffer from the lack of exploration and the distributional shifts in
trajectories once controllers are updated. Moreover, most RL methods require
that all states are directly observed, which is difficult to be attained in
many settings.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a trajectory generation algorithm,
which adaptively generates new trajectories as if the system is being operated
and explored under the updated control policies. Motivated by the fundamental
lemma for linear systems, assuming sufficient excitation, we generate
trajectories from linear combinations of historical trajectories. For linear
feedback control, we prove that the algorithm generates trajectories with the
exact distribution as if they are sampled from the real system using the
updated control policy. In particular, the algorithm extends to systems where
the states are not directly observed. Experiments show that the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of sampled data needed for RL algorithms.

constraints during training has recently received a lot of attention. Safety
filters, e.g., based on control barrier functions (CBFs), provide a promising
way for safe RL via modifying the unsafe actions of an RL agent on the fly.
Existing safety filter-based approaches typically involve learning of uncertain
dynamics and quantifying the learned model error, which leads to conservative
filters before a large amount of data is collected to learn a good model,
thereby preventing efficient exploration. This paper presents a method for safe
and efficient model-free RL using disturbance observers (DOBs) and control
barrier functions (CBFs). Unlike most existing safe RL methods that deal with
hard state constraints, our method does not involve model learning, and
leverages DOBs to accurately estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty,
which is then incorporated into a robust CBF condition to generate safe
actions. The DOB-based CBF can be used as a safety filter with any model-free
RL algorithms by minimally modifying the actions of an RL agent whenever
necessary to ensure safety throughout the learning process. Simulation results
on a unicycle and a 2D quadrotor demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms a state-of-the-art safe RL algorithm using CBFs and Gaussian
processes-based model learning, in terms of safety violation rate, and sample
and computational efficiency.

hierarchy problem and construct an alternative scheme to the conventional
solutions with top partners. In traditional models, like SUSY or composite
Higgs, top partners cancel the top loop contribution to the Higgs quadratic
term. The lack of evidence for such colored partners however drives these
models into more and more fine-tuned regions. Here, an alternative means to
mitigate the top loop, allowing for natural electroweak symmetry breaking, is
presented. Emphasizing that we have not measured the top-Higgs interactions at
high scales yet, we envisage scenarios where this interaction is only
approaching its sizable strength in the infra-red, but gets strongly suppressed
at high scales. We first discuss possible effects via a modification of the
running of the top Yukawa coupling. Then, we turn to models where the top
Yukawa is generated at one-loop level. Originated from a dimension-six
operator, it drops when crossing the mass threshold of new degrees of freedom.
In either case, the top partners are replaced by some new top-philic particles
with strong interaction. Thus, a very different phenomenology, such as large
top mass running and signals in four top final states, is introduced, which
will be discussed in detail. With the assistance of this mechanism, the
solution to the hierarchy problem can be pushed to a (well-defined) higher
scale, and a final test of naturalness might be deferred to a 100 TeV Collider,
like the FCC.

broad ranges of PDEs with one bounded dimension, where the incorporation of
general boundary conditions is well understood. However, automating extensions
to domains with multiple bounded dimensions is challenging because of
difficulties in implementing boundary conditions and imposing compatibility
conditions at shared edges and corners. Past work has included various
workarounds, such as the anisotropic inclusion of partial boundary data at
shared edges or approaches that only work for specific boundary conditions.
Here we present a general system for imposing boundary and compatibility
conditions for elliptic equations on hypercubes. We take an approach based on
the generalized tau method, which allows for a wide range of boundary
conditions for many types of spectral methods. The generalized tau method has
the distinct advantage that the specified polynomial residual determines the
exact algebraic solution; afterwards, any stable numerical scheme will find the
same result. We can, therefore, provide one-to-one comparisons to traditional
collocation and Galerkin methods within the tau framework. As an essential
requirement, we add specific tau corrections to the boundary conditions in
addition to the bulk PDE. We then impose additional mutual compatibility
conditions to ensure boundary conditions match at shared subsurfaces. Our
approach works with general boundary conditions that commute on intersecting
subsurfaces, including Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and any combination of these
on all boundaries. The tau corrections and compatibility conditions can be
fully isotropic and easily incorporated into existing solvers. We present the
method explicitly for the Poisson equation in two and three dimensions and
describe its extension to arbitrary elliptic equations (e.g. biharmonic) in any

theory, we use the Distributed Information Bottleneck to find optimal
compressions of each feature that maximally preserve information about the
output. The learned information allocation, by feature and by feature value,
provides rich opportunities for interpretation, particularly in problems with
many features and complex feature interactions. The central object of analysis

solving the problem of feature selection by constructing a learned continuum of

decipher the impact of shocks arising due to MHD instabilities in driving the
longterm variable emission signatures from blazars. In this regard, we have
performed RMHD simulations of a representative section of blazar jet. The jet
is evolved using a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to account for
radiative losses due to synchrotron process and particle acceleration due to
shocks. Additionally, we have incorporated and validated radiative losses due
to the external Compton (EC) process that are relevant for blazars. We have
further compared the effects of different radiation mechanisms through
numerical simulation of 2D slab jet as a validation test. Finally, we have
carried out a parametric study to quantify the effect of magnetic fields and
external radiation field characteristics by performing 3D simulations of a
plasma column. The synthetic light curves and spectral energy distribution

driven shocks. We observe that shocks produced with the evolution of
instabilities give rise to flaring signatures in the high energy band. The
impact of such shocks is also evident from the instantaneous flattening of the
synchrotron component of the SEDs. At later stages, we observe the transition
in X-ray emission from the synchrotron process to that dominated by EC. The
inclusion of the EC process also gives rise to gamma-ray emission and shows

disk-dominated galaxies - which show no ""classical"" bulges - suggests that
secular mechanisms represent an important growth pathway for supermassive black
holes in these systems. We present new follow-up NuSTAR observations of the
optically-elusive AGNs in two bulgeless galaxies, NGC 4178 and J0851+3926. NGC
4178 was originally reported as hosting an AGN based on the detection of [Ne V]
mid-infrared emission detected by Spitzer, and based on Chandra X-ray imaging
it has since been argued to host either a heavily obscured AGN or a supernova
remnant. J0851+3926 was originally identified as an AGN based on its WISE
mid-IR colors, and follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy previously revealed a
hidden broad line region, offering compelling evidence for an optically-elusive
AGN. Neither AGN is detected within the new NuSTAR imaging, and we derive upper
limits on the hard X-ray 10-24 keV fluxes of $<7.41\times10^{-14}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $<9.40\times10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the
AGNs in NGC 4178 and J0851+3926, respectively. If these non-detections are due
to large absorbing columns along the line of sight, the non-detections in NGC
4178 and J0851+3926 could be explained with column densities of
log($N_{\rm{H}}/\rm{cm}^2)>24.2$ and log($N_{\rm{H}}/\rm{cm}^2)>24.1$,
respectively. The nature of the nuclear activity in NGC 4178 remains
inconclusive; it is plausible that the [Ne V] traces a period of higher
activity in the past, but that the AGN is relatively quiescent now. The
non-detection in J0851+3926 and multiwavelength properties are consistent with
the AGN being heavily obscured.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic relations among these physical quantities are far
from clear. Here, we prove the universal geometric relations among them in
acoustics, independent on wave structure details. Particularly, we connect
acoustic spin and torque to the cross product of time-averaged energy flow and
reactive power, as well as to the local vorticity of energy flow. These
relations are universally valid, verified in a variety of different acoustic

generated in three acoustic near-field sources: Janus, Huygens and Spin

uncover hidden locking relations beyond simple spin-momentum locking of
near-field waves, and show the basic principles between the acoustic spin,

episode a few Myrs ago, which likely produced many T Tauri stars hosting
circumstellar discs. It has been suggested that these discs may be the compact
and dusty ionized sources identified as ``G-clouds''. Given the Galactic
Centre's hostile environment, we study the possible evolutionary pathways these
discs experience. We compute new external photoevaporation models applicable to
discs in the Galactic Centre that account for the sub-sonic launching of the
wind and absorption of UV photons by dust. Using evolutionary disc
calculations, we find that photoevaporation's rapid truncation of the disc
causes them to accrete onto the central star rapidly. Ultimately, an accreting
circumstellar disc has a lifetime $\lesssim1~$Myr, which would fail to live
long enough to explain the G-clouds. However, we identify a new evolutionary
pathway for circumstellar discs in the Galactic Centre. Removal of disc
material by photoevaporation prevents the young star from spinning down due to
magnetic braking, ultimately causing the rapidly spinning young star to torque
the disc into a ``decretion disc'' state which prevents accretion. At the same
time, any planetary companion in the disc will trap dust outside its orbit,
shutting down photoevaporation. The disc can survive for up to $\sim$10 Myr in
this state. Encounters with other stars are likely to remove the planet on Myr
timescales, causing photoevaporation to restart, giving rise to a G-cloud
signature. A giant planet fraction of $\sim10\%$ can explain the number of
observed G-clouds.

their symmetries, culminating in a modern electronic band theory where
wavefunction topology can be obtained (in part) from momentum space. Recently,
Real Space Invariants (RSIs) have provided a spatially local description of the
global momentum space indices. The present work generalizes this real space
classification to interacting 2D states. We construct many-body local RSIs as
the quantum numbers of a set of symmetry operators on open boundaries, but
which are independent of the choice of boundary. Using the $U(1)$ particle
number, they yield many-body fragile topological indices, which we use to
identify which single-particle fragile states are many-body topological or
trivial at weak coupling. To this end, we construct an exactly solvable
Hamiltonian with single-particle fragile topology that is adiabatically
connected to a trivial state through strong coupling. We then define global
many-body RSIs on periodic boundary conditions. They reduce to Chern numbers in
the band theory limit, but also identify strongly correlated stable topological
phases with no single-particle counterpart. Finally, we show that the many-body
local RSIs appear as quantized coefficients of Wen-Zee terms in the topological
quantum field theory describing the phase.

confirmed clusters at $1.4<z<2.8$, which span a total stellar mass
$11.3<\mathrm{log}(M^c_*/M_{\odot})<12.6$ (halo mass $13.5 \lesssim
\mathrm{log}(M^c_h/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 14.5$). Our main finding is that cluster
passive ETG at $z \gtrsim 1.5$ with ${\rm log}(M/M_{\odot})>10.5$ are
systematically $\gtrsim 0.2-0.3~{\rm dex}$ larger than field ETGs. The passive
ETG average size evolution is slower at $1<z<2$ when compared to the field.
This could be explained by differences in the formation and early evolution of
galaxies in haloes of a different mass. Strong compaction and gas dissipation
in field galaxies, followed by a sequence of mergers may have also played a
significant role in the field ETG evolution, but not in the evolution of
cluster galaxies. Our passive ETG mass-size relation shows a tendency to
flatten at $9.6<{\rm log}(M/M_{\odot})<10.5$, where the average size is
$\mathrm{log}(R_e/\mathrm{kpc}) = 0.05 \pm 0.22$. This implies that galaxies in
the low end of the mass-size relation do not evolve much from $z\sim 2$ to the
present, and that their sizes evolve in a similar way in clusters and in the
field. BCGs lie on the same mass-size relation as satellites, suggesting that
their size evolution is not different at redshift z $\gtrsim$ 2. Half of the
active ETGs ($\sim 30\%$ of the ETGs) follow the field passive galaxy mass-size
relation, and the other half follow the field active galaxy mass-size relation.
These galaxies likely went through a recent merger or neighbor galaxy
interaction, and would most probably quench at a later epoch and increase the
fraction of passive ETGs in clusters. We do not observe a large population of
compact galaxies, as is observed in the field at these redshifts, implying that
the galaxies in our clusters are not observed in an epoch close to their
compaction.

examine off-spiral arm star formation in the face-on, grand-design spiral
galaxy NGC 628. We focus on the northern spiral arm, around a galactocentric
radius of 3-4 kpc, and study two spurs. These form an interesting contrast, as
one is CO-rich and one CO-poor, and they have a maximum azimuthal offset in
MIRI 21$\mu$m and MUSE H$\alpha$ of around 40$^\circ$ (CO-rich) and 55$^\circ$
(CO-poor) from the spiral arm. The star formation rate is higher in the regions
of the spurs near to spiral arms, but the star formation efficiency appears
relatively constant. Given the spiral pattern speed and rotation curve of this
galaxy and assuming material exiting the arms undergoes purely circular motion,
these offsets would be reached in 100-150 Myr, significantly longer than the
21$\mu$m and H$\alpha$ star formation timescales (both <10 Myr). The invariance
of the star formation efficiency in the spurs versus the spiral arms indicates
massive star formation is not only triggered in spiral arms, and cannot simply
occur in the arms and then drift away from the wave pattern. These early JWST
results show that in-situ star formation likely occurs in the spurs, and that
the observed young stars are not simply the `leftovers' of stellar birth in the
spiral arms. The excellent physical resolution and sensitivity that JWST can
attain in nearby galaxies will well resolve individual star-forming regions and
help us to better understand the earliest phases of star formation.

results in a significant local $\nu-\bar{\nu}$ asymmetry, far exceeding the
expected primordial lepton asymmetry. The net fractional electron neutrino
number $\frac{n_{\nu_e}-n_{\bar{\nu}_e}}{n_{\nu_e}}$ is up to
$\mathcal{O}(10^5) \sqrt{\frac{m_\nu}{0.1~\text{eV}}}$ larger than that implied
by the baryon asymmetry. This enhancement is due to the weak 4-Fermi repulsion
of the $\nu_e$ from ordinary matter which slows down the $\nu_e$ near the
Earth's surface, and to the resulting evanescent neutrino wave that penetrates
below the surface. This repulsion thus creates a net $\nu_e$ overdensity in a
shell $\sim 7~\text{meters} \sqrt{\frac{0.1~\text{eV}}{m_\nu}}$ thick around
the Earth's surface. Similarly the repulsion between $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ or
$\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and ordinary matter creates an overdensity of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu,
\tau}$ of similar size. These local enhancements increase the size of
$\mathcal{O}(G_F)$ torques of the $C\nu B$ on spin-polarized matter by a factor
of order $10^5$. In addition, they create a gradient of the net neutrino
density which naturally provides a way out of the forty-year-old ``no-go''
theorems on the vanishing of $\mathcal{O}(G_F)$ forces. The torque resulting
from such a gradient force can be $10^8$ times larger than that of earlier
proposals. Although the size of these effects is still far from current reach,
they may point to new directions for $C\nu B$ detection.

as part of the ALPINE survey with unusual UV spectral features that have been
interpreted as signatures of either a double stellar population or of an active
galactic nucleus (AGN). We exploited the multi-wavelength coverage of GS-14 to
investigate the properties and the origin of its emission. We performed
UV-to-NIR SED-fitting, with single/double stellar population and/or AGN
component. We analyzed the VIMOS spectrum, which shows highly-ionized emission
lines (Ovi, Nv, and Niv). The line properties have been compared with those
observed in galaxies and AGN, and with the predictions from radiation transfer
models for star-forming galaxies, AGN, and shocks. The SED-fitting provides a
total stellar mass of $M_*=(4 \pm 1) \times 10^{10} M_\odot$, an age of the
main stellar population of $\sim670 Myr$ and a recent short (8 Myr) burst of
star formation (SF) of $\sim 90 M_\odot yr^{-1}$. The Nv line has a
characteristic P-Cygni profile, which suggests a $\sim 3 Myr$ old population of
stars with a mass of $\sim 5 \times10^{7} M_\odot$. The Nv profile also shows
evidence for an additional component of nebular emission. The comparison of the
line ratios with theoretical models allows us to associate the emission with SF
or AGN, but the strong radiation field required to ionize the Ovi is more
commonly related to AGN activity. We found evidence for an old and already
evolved stellar population at $z\sim 5.5$ and show that the galaxy is
experiencing a second short burst of SF. In addition, GS-14 carries signatures
of obscured AGN activity. The AGN could be responsible for the short depletion

parity (or CP) may be a gauge symmetry which is higgsed in our universe. This
is assumed in many scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model, including
the classic Nelson--Barr proposal for the Strong CP problem. Gauged parity can
only arise in quantum gravity, where it corresponds to a path integral over
both orientable and non-orientable spacetime manifolds. We show that
spontaneous breaking of gauged parity leads to exactly stable domain walls, and
describe the implications for the cosmology of models with gauged parity. These
domain walls carry an unusual sort of charge, which superficially has features
in common with both gauge charges and global charges. We show that these
unusual charges are consistent with the expected absence of global symmetries
in quantum gravity when there exists a complete spectrum of dynamical objects
required by the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, including end-of-the-world
branes.

cluster dynamical status, assembly history, and the evolution of cluster

identification and characterization of group-sized substructures in clusters.
Our new method is based on the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities
of cluster galaxies, and it is an improvement and extension of the traditional
method of Dressler & Shectman (1988). We test it on cluster-size cosmological
halos extracted from the IllustrisTNG simulations, with virial masses $\rm{14
\lesssim \log (M_{200}/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 14.6}$, that contain on average
$\sim 190$ galaxies. We also present an application of our method on a real
data set, the Bullet cluster. DS+ is able to identify $\sim 80\%$ of real group
galaxies as members of substructures, and at least 60\% of the galaxies
assigned to substructures belong to real groups. The physical properties of the
real groups are significantly correlated with those of the corresponding
detected substructures, albeit with significant scatter, and overestimated on
average. Application of the DS+ method to the Bullet cluster confirms the
presence and main properties of the high-speed collision and identifies other
substructures along the main cluster axis. DS+ proves to be a reliable method
for the identification of substructures in clusters. The method is made freely
available to the community as a Python code.

complex systems, which can be used to induce a plethora of new physical
phenomena. However, when applied to many-body systems, Floquet driving can also
cause heating, and lead to a featureless infinite-temperature state, hindering
most useful applications. It is therefore important to find mechanisms to
suppress such effects. Floquet prethermalization refers to the phenomenon where
many-body systems subject to a high-frequency periodic drive avoid heating for
very long times, instead tending to transient states that can host interesting
physics. Its key signature is a strong parametric suppression of the heating
rate as a function of the driving frequency. Here, we review our present
understanding of this phenomenon in both quantum and classical systems, and
across various models and methods. In particular, we present rigorous theorems
underpinning Floquet prethermalization in quantum spin and fermionic lattice
systems, extensions to systems with degrees of freedom that have unbounded
local dimension. Further, we briefly describe applications to novel
nonequilibrium phases of matter, and recent experiments probing
prethermalization with quantum simulators. We close by describing the frontiers
of Floquet prethermalization beyond strictly time-periodic drives, including
time-quasiperiodic driving and long-lived quasi-conserved quantities enabled by

that the proper motion distributions contain NSD stars rotating eastwards and

we employ the Vision Transformer as an architecture for training a very strong

Transformer's inherent property to process information (visual tokens)
extracted from irregular grids to devise a pipeline for face recognition which

part fViT, simply comprises a lightweight network to predict the coordinates of
facial landmarks followed by the Vision Transformer operating on patches
extracted from the predicted landmarks, and it is trained end-to-end with no

muscle anatomy, metabolic disease and aging. Many efforts have been put into
quantifying muscle tissues with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging including
manual annotation of individual muscles. However, leveraging publicly available
annotations in MR images to achieve muscle group segmentation on single slice
computed tomography (CT) thigh images is challenging.
  Method: We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation pipeline with
self-training to transfer labels from 3D MR to single CT slice. First, we
transform the image appearance from MR to CT with CycleGAN and feed the
synthesized CT images to a segmenter simultaneously. Single CT slices are
divided into hard and easy cohorts based on the entropy of pseudo labels
inferenced by the segmenter. After refining easy cohort pseudo labels based on
anatomical assumption, self-training with easy and hard splits is applied to
fine tune the segmenter.
  Results: On 152 withheld single CT thigh images, the proposed pipeline
achieved a mean Dice of 0.888(0.041) across all muscle groups including
sartorius, hamstrings, quadriceps femoris and gracilis. muscles
  Conclusion: To our best knowledge, this is the first pipeline to achieve
thigh imaging domain adaptation from MR to CT. The proposed pipeline is
effective and robust in extracting muscle groups on 2D single slice CT thigh
images.The container is available for public use at

oscillations (QPOs), observed in BHXBs during the soft-intermediate state

relativistic jet. The X-ray spectrum of a source in the SIMS is characterised
by a dominant soft blackbody-like component - associated with the accretion
disc - and a hard component - associated with a Comptonizing region or corona.
Strong type-B QPOs were observed by NICER and AstroSat in GX 339$-$4 during its
2021 outburst. We find that the fractional rms spectrum of the QPO remains
constant at $\sim$1 per cent for energies below $\sim$1.8 keV and then
increases with increasing energy up to $\sim$17 per cent at 20$-$30 keV. We
also find that the lag spectrum is ""U-shaped"", decreasing from $\sim$1.2 rad at
0.7 keV to 0 rad at $\sim$3.5 keV, and increasing again at higher energies up
to $\sim$0.6 rad at 20$-$30 keV. Using a recently developed time-dependent
Comptonization model, we fit simultaneously the fractional rms and lag spectra
of the QPO and the time-averaged energy spectrum of GX 339$-$4 to constrain the
physical parameters of the region responsible for the variability we observe.
We suggest that the radiative properties of the type-B QPOs observed in GX
339$-$4 can be explained by two physically-connected Comptonizing regions that
interact with the accretion disc via a feedback loop of X-ray photons.

Therefore, we solve this problem by proposing a differentially private enhanced

utilize the $\epsilon$ through the reuse of the privacy budget for the repeated

results confirm that EDH-IIoT obtains an accuracy of 97% in the shared data for
$\epsilon_{t}$ = 1, and a reduction of 35.96% in spending of $\epsilon$.

surgical robots and downstream tasks. CaRTS, based on a complementary causal
model, has shown promising performance in unseen counterfactual surgical

30 iterations of optimization to converge for a single image due to limited
observability. Method: To address the above limitations, we take temporal
relation into consideration and propose a temporal causal model for robot tool
segmentation on video sequences. We design an architecture named Temporally
Constrained CaRTS (TC-CaRTS). TC-CaRTS has three novel modules to complement
CaRTS - temporal optimization pipeline, kinematics correction network, and
spatial-temporal regularization. Results: Experiment results show that TC-CaRTS
requires much fewer iterations to achieve the same or better performance as
CaRTS. TC- CaRTS also has the same or better performance in different domains
compared to CaRTS. All three modules are proven to be effective. Conclusion: We
propose TC-CaRTS, which takes advantage of temporal constraints as additional
observability. We show that TC-CaRTS outperforms prior work in the robot tool

Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy power spectra, due to their
accretion-powered injection of energy into the recombining plasma. Here we
study a qualitatively new CMB observable sourced by accreting PBHs: the
temperature trispectrum or connected 4-point function. This non-Gaussian
signature is due to the strong spatial modulation of the PBH accretion
luminosity, thus ionization perturbations, by large-scale supersonic relative
velocities between PBHs and the accreted baryons. We first derive a
factorizable quadratic transfer function for free-electron fraction
inhomogeneities induced by accreting PBHs. We then compute the perturbation to
the CMB temperature anisotropy due to a general modification of recombination,
and apply our results to accreting PBHs. We calculate a new contribution to the
temperature power spectrum due to the spatial fluctuations of the ionization
perturbation induced by accreting PBHs, going beyond past studies which only
accounted for its homogeneous part. While these contributions are formally
comparable, we find the new part to be subdominant, due to the poor correlation
of the perturbed temperature field with the standard CMB anisotropy. For the
first time, we compute the temperature trispectrum due to accreting PBHs. This
trispectrum is weakly correlated with the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity
trispectrum, hence constraints on the latter do not lead to competitive bounds
on accreting PBHs. We also forecast Planck's sensitivity to the temperature
trispectrum sourced by accreting PBHs. Excitingly, we find it to be more
sensitive to PBHs under $\sim 10^3 M_{\odot}$ than current temperature-only
power spectrum constraints. This result motivates our future work extending
this study to temperature and polarization trispectra induced by
inhomogeneously-accreting PBHs.

pumping. Here I discuss the reciprocal process: that a voltage bias produces a
layer-shear mechanical force. The effect is deduced from the lowest-order
correction to the mechanical action by the coupling with electrons in an
external field. In twisted bilayer graphene the new mechanical force is shown
to be perpendicular to the applied field (due to C$_2$ symmetries exchanging
the layers) and proportional to the charge density measured from neutrality.
This is strictly true when the chemical potential is within a gap opened by the
moir\'e potential due to a topological quantization, and approximately true
when the chemical potential crosses the flat bands in a model including the
self-consistent Hartree interaction. In a mechanical device the effect should

  welcome",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the classic stochastic linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem
under an infinite horizon average stage cost. By leveraging recent policy
gradient methods from reinforcement learning, we obtain a first-order method
that finds a stable feedback law whose objective function gap to the optima is
at most $\varepsilon$ with high probability using $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)$
samples, where $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic dependence on $\varepsilon$.
Our proposed method seems to have the best dependence on $\varepsilon$ within
the model-free literature without the assumption that all policies generated by
the algorithm are stable almost surely, and it matches the best-known rate from
the model-based literature, up to logarithmic factors. The improved dependence
on $\varepsilon$ is achieved by showing the accuracy scales with the variance
rather than the standard deviation of the gradient estimation error. Our
developments that result in this improved sampling complexity fall in the
category of actor-critic algorithms. The actor part involves a variational
inequality formulation of the stochastic LQR problem, while in the critic part,
we utilize a conditional stochastic primal-dual method and show that the
algorithm has the optimal rate of convergence when paired with a shrinking
multi-epoch scheme.

phase on the excited spin modes which allowed us to discover several prominent
effects previously overlooked. In particular, the non-collinearity makes the
quasi-antiferromagnetic mode sensitive to the external magnetic field and
brings its frequency close to the frequency of the quasiferromagnetic mode. The
latter maximizes near the magnetization compensation point and vanishes towards
the collinear phase. Spectacularly, at the phase transition the
quasiferromagnetic mode becomes soft and its amplitude significantly increases
reaching 7{\deg}. This opens new opportunities for the ultrafast control of
spins in ferrimagnets for nonthermal data storage and data processing.

chip area and reconfiguration latency, making efficient FPGA accelerations that
require switching between multiple configurations still elusive. In this paper,
we perform technology-circuit-architecture co-design to break this tradeoff
with no additional area cost and lower power consumption compared with
conventional designs while providing dynamic reconfiguration, which can hide
the reconfiguration time behind the execution time. Leveraging the intrinsic
transistor structure and non-volatility of ferroelectric FET (FeFET), compact
FPGA primitives are proposed and experimentally verified, including 1FeFET
look-up table (LUT) cell, 1FeFET routing cell for connection blocks (CBs) and
switch boxes (SBs). To support dynamic reconfiguration, two local copies of
primitives are placed in parallel, which enables loading of arbitrary
configuration without interrupting the active configuration execution. A
comprehensive evaluation shows that compared with the SRAM-based FPGA, our
dynamic reconfiguration design shows 63.0%/71.1% reduction in LUT/CB area and
82.7%/53.6% reduction in CB/SB power consumption with minimal penalty in the
critical path delay (9.6%). We further implement a Super-Sub network model to
show the benefit from the context-switching capability of our design. We also
evaluate the timing performance of our design over conventional FPGA in various
application scenarios. In one scenario that users switch between two preloaded
configurations, our design yields significant time saving by 78.7% on average.
In the other scenario of implementing multiple configurations with dynamic
reconfiguration, our design offers time saving of 20.3% on average.

Here we report the strong influence of end-functionalising the chain ends

find that the azide(N3)- functionalisation renders the chain ends weakly

flower-micelles. This hydrophobicity increases with increasing temperature and
poses a competing self-assembling mechanism to the solvent induces hydrophobic
interactions between the middle-blocks of F108 at higher temperatures and leads
to a macroscopic phase separation that is absent in the pure F108 system.
However, when we attached short, hydrophilic single-stranded (ss)DNA to the
azide groups via click chemistry the chain ends became 'sticky' due to DNA
hybridisation below the melting temperature of the complementary ssDNA ends
while reverting to hydrophilic behaviour above. We characterise their

  In this paper, we prove that the relative dominant dimension of the regular
module of a quasi-hereditary algebra with a simple preserving duality with
respect to a summand $Q$ of a characteristic tilting module equals twice the
relative dominant dimension of a characteristic tilting module with respect to
$Q$.
  To resolve the Temperley-Lieb algebras of infinite global dimension, we apply
this result to the class of Schur algebras $S(2, d)$ and $Q=V^{\otimes d}$ the
$d$-tensor power of the 2-dimensional module and we completely determine the

Planck-suppressed operators is not scale-invariant: heavy particles which have
nothing to do with the UV completion of gravity can mediate the breaking and
produce low-energy operators (partly) suppressed by their own mass scales. Such
contributions from heavy fields are typically subdominant with respect to the
least Planck-suppressed operators, unless the latter are forbidden, as is usual
in solutions to the axion quality problem based on four-dimensional gauge
symmetries. Therefore, with a focus on axion physics, I investigate such
situations and present toy examples where a non-minimal sector of heavy fields
coupling to the axion generates operators whose coefficients are orders of
magnitude larger than the naive Planck-suppressed estimates, despite gravity
being the only source of breaking. I also stress that the key features of these
toy models, namely several families of heavy fields with family-dependent gauge
charges, are already present in some non-minimal QCD axion models, using the
axiflavon/flaxion and the lighter-than-usual KSVZ axion as examples. This
suggests that gauge-symmetry-based solutions to the axion quality problem, or

are made available, and developers reuse them for different problems. In
contrast, developers mostly build their models from scratch for traditional
DL-related problems. By doing so, they have control over the choice of
algorithms, data processing, model structure, tuning hyperparameters, etc.
Whereas in NLP, due to the reuse of the pre-trained models, NLP developers are
limited to little to no control over such design decisions. They either apply
tuning or transfer learning on pre-trained models to meet their requirements.
Also, NLP models and their corresponding datasets are significantly larger than
the traditional DL models and require heavy computation. Such reasons often
lead to bugs in the system while reusing the pre-trained models. While bugs in
traditional DL software have been intensively studied, the nature of extensive
reuse and black-box structure motivates us to understand the different types of

chains, they are typically costly to implement and consume high power. A common
method to reduce the cost of MIMO receivers is utilizing less RF chains than
antennas by employing hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF). However, the
added analog circuitry involves active components whose consumed power may
surpass that saved in RF chain reduction. An additional method to realize
power-efficient MIMO systems is to use low-resolution analog-to-digital

this work, we propose a power-efficient hybrid MIMO receiver with
low-quantization rate ADCs, by jointly optimizing the analog and digital

account for common mismatches induced by non-ideal hardware and inaccurate
channel state information, we propose a robust mismatch aware design. Supported
by numerical simulations and power analysis, our power-efficient MIMO receiver
achieves comparable signal recovery performance to power-hungry fully-digital
MIMO receivers using high-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, our receiver
outperforms the task-agnostic HBF receivers with low-rate ADCs in recovery
accuracy at lower power and successfully copes with hardware mismatches.

times of periastron in an eccentric binary system, similar to the periastron
encounters of $\eta$ Carinae leading up to its Great Eruption, and resembling
the erratic pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. We attribute the irregularity of the
eruptions to the interplay between the orbit and the variability of the
luminous blue variable (LBV) primary star, wherein each successive periastron
pass may have a different intensity or duration due to the changing radius and
mass-loss rate of the LBV-like primary. Such outbursts may occasionally be weak
or undetectable if the LBV is relatively quiescent at periastron, but can be
much more extreme when the LBV is active. The observed change in orbital period
may be a consequence of mass lost in outbursts. Given the similarity to the

Learning
when to communicate, i.e., sparse (in time) communication, and whom to message

sparse individualized communication, however, suffers from high variance during
training, where decreasing communication comes at the cost of decreased reward,
particularly in cooperative tasks. We use the information bottleneck to reframe
sparsity as a representation learning problem, which we show naturally enables
lossless sparse communication at lower budgets than prior art. In this paper,
we propose a method for true lossless sparsity in communication via Information
Maximizing Gated Sparse Multi-Agent Communication (IMGS-MAC). Our model uses
two individualized regularization objectives, an information maximization
autoencoder and sparse communication loss, to create informative and sparse
communication. We evaluate the learned communication `language' through direct
causal analysis of messages in non-sparse runs to determine the range of
lossless sparse budgets, which allow zero-shot sparsity, and the range of
sparse budgets that will inquire a reward loss, which is minimized by our
learned gating function with few-shot sparsity. To demonstrate the efficacy of
our results, we experiment in cooperative multi-agent tasks where communication
is essential for success. We evaluate our model with both continuous and

arising from an image charge induced by the graphene layer. Furthermore, we

where online exploration is not feasible. In such domains, decision-making
should take into consideration the risk of catastrophic outcomes. In other
words, decision-making should be risk-averse. An additional challenge of
offline RL is avoiding distributional shift, i.e. ensuring that state-action
pairs visited by the policy remain near those in the dataset. Previous works on
risk in offline RL combine offline RL techniques (to avoid distributional
shift), with risk-sensitive RL algorithms (to achieve risk-aversion). In this
work, we propose risk-aversion as a mechanism to jointly address both of these
issues. We propose a model-based approach, and use an ensemble of models to
estimate epistemic uncertainty, in addition to aleatoric uncertainty. We train
a policy that is risk-averse, and avoids high uncertainty actions.
Risk-aversion to epistemic uncertainty prevents distributional shift, as areas
not covered by the dataset have high epistemic uncertainty. Risk-aversion to
aleatoric uncertainty discourages actions that are inherently risky due to
environment stochasticity. Thus, by only introducing risk-aversion, we avoid
distributional shift in addition to achieving risk-aversion to aleatoric risk.
Our algorithm, 1R2R, achieves strong performance on deterministic benchmarks,
and outperforms existing approaches for risk-sensitive objectives in stochastic
domains.

astronomy in the context of indirect dark matter detection. We have applied a
multi-wavelength strategy by studying different signals across the
electromagnetic spectrum (gamma-rays, X-rays, radio waves) produced at
different scales of the Universe (galactic, extragalactic, cosmic web
filaments).
  In Part I, we obtained the first-ever prediction of the cross-correlation
signal between the extragalactic gamma-ray flux and the 21cm line emitted by
hydrogen atoms in dark matter halos. We showed that the neutral hydrogen
distribution is a highly competitive probe for dark matter searches, especially
in view of the next-generation radio telescope Square Kilometre Array.
  In Part II, we obtained the limits on the annihilation cross-section of dark
matter particles by comparing the X-ray flux measured by INTEGRAL with the
theoretical signal expected in the case of particles with a mass between 1 MeV
and 5 GeV. We derived the most stringent constraints in the literature on such
particles with a mass between 150 MeV and 1.5 GeV. The originality of this work
resides in including the contribution from the scattering between the
low-energy photons in the Milky Way with the electrons and positrons, produced
by dark matter particles.
  In Part III, we focused on an exotic radio signal, emerging from the GLEAM
survey, which seems compatible with a filament of the cosmic web and provides
direct evidence for one of the pillars of our understanding of structure
formation in the Universe. This radio emission can be explained by dark matter
candidates with a mass in the range of 5-10 GeV, decaying into pairs of
electrons and positrons.
  This thesis contributes to a broad spectrum of research for particle dark

One of the
main development is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position
calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP)
measurements. An excellent choice is the application of proton computed
tomography (pCT) systems which take the images under similar conditions to
treatment as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging
and treatment. A key aim is to develop an accurate image reconstruction
algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.
  Approach: An image reconstruction algorithm was developed in this work, which
is suitable to reconstruct pCT images from the energy, position and direction
measurement of individual protons. The flexibility of an iterative image
reconstruction algorithm was utilised to appropriately model the trajectory of
protons. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of a Derenzo and a CTP404 phantom was
used to test the accuracy of the image reconstruction.
  Main results: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm was applied first and
successfully for pCT image reconstruction. Probability density based approach
was applied for interaction (system) matrix generation, which is an advanced
approach to consider the uncertain path of the protons in the patient.
  Significance: The track of protons are scattered when they travel through
material at the hadron therapy energies. This property limits the achievable
spatial resolution, especially for single-sided pCT setups investigated in this
study. The main motivation of the presented research is to test new approaches
for the image reconstruction, focusing on the achieved spatial- and density
resolution and the image noise. Realistic imaging setup were simulated with
reasonably low proton statistics, to achieve results, which is likely to be
reproducible in clinical environment.

adopted in various applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) to leverage
variety of benefits through data analysis. The protection of sensitive
information is achieved through the addition of noise into the query response
which hides the individual records in a dataset. However, the noise addition
negatively impacts the accuracy which gives rise to privacy-utility trade-off.
Moreover, the DP budget or cost $\epsilon$ is often fixed and it accumulates
due to the sequential composition which limits the number of queries.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework known as optimized
privacy-utility trade-off framework for data sharing in IoT (OPU-TF-IoT).
Firstly, OPU-TF-IoT uses an adaptive approach to utilize the DP budget
$\epsilon$ by considering a new metric of population or dataset size along with
the query. Secondly, our proposed heuristic search algorithm reduces the DP
budget accordingly whereas satisfying both data owner and data user. Thirdly,
to make the utilization of DP budget transparent to the data owners, a
blockchain-based verification mechanism is also proposed. Finally, the proposed
framework is evaluated using real-world datasets and compared with the
traditional DP model and other related state-of-the-art works. The results
confirm that our proposed framework not only utilize the DP budget $\epsilon$
efficiently, but it also optimizes the number of queries. Furthermore, the data
owners can effectively make sure that their data is shared accordingly through
our blockchain-based verification mechanism which encourages them to share
their data into the IoT system.

a total of 1063 compact stellar clusters and 2654 stellar associations

more aligned with models of larger, ionized PAHs. These JWST data usher in a

fields near stellar clusters and associations play a role in shaping the
physical properties of PAHs.

that these are sufficient to recover the Zinbiel and Tortkara identities of
Dzhumadil'daev (2007). We use these identities to prove that any element of the

Moreover, we consider minimal sets of iterated integrals defined through the
recursive application of the half shuffle on Hall trees. Leveraging the duality
between this set of Hall integrals and classical Hall bases of the free Lie
algebra, we prove using combinatorial arguments that any element of the free
half shuffle algebra can be written uniquely as a polynomial over Hall

allowing to split any real valued function on streamed data into two parts: a
first that extracts and packages the streamed information into recursively
defined atomic objects (Hall integrals), and a second that evaluates a
polynomial function in these objects without further reference to the original
stream. The question of whether a similar result holds if Hall integrals are
replaced by Hall areas is left as an open conjecture. Finally, we construct a
canonical, but to our knowledge, new decomposition of the free half shuffle
algebra as shuffle power series in the greatest letter of the original alphabet
with coefficients in a sub-algebra freely generated by a new alphabet with an
infinite number of letters. We use this construction to provide a second proof

often needs to decide which queries will best support their intended analysis.
For example, an analyst may wish to study noisy two-way marginals in a dataset
produced by a mechanism M1. But, if the data are relatively sparse, the analyst
may choose to examine noisy one-way marginals, produced by a mechanism M2
instead. Since the choice of whether to use M1 or M2 is data-dependent, a
typical differentially private workflow is to first split the privacy loss
budget rho into two parts: rho1 and rho2, then use the first part rho1 to
determine which mechanism to use, and the remainder rho2 to obtain noisy
answers from the chosen mechanism. In a sense, the first step seems wasteful
because it takes away part of the privacy loss budget that could have been used
to make the query answers more accurate.
  In this paper, we consider the question of whether the choice between M1 and
M2 can be performed without wasting any privacy loss budget. For linear
queries, we propose a method for decomposing M1 and M2 into three parts: (1) a
mechanism M* that captures their shared information, (2) a mechanism M1' that
captures information that is specific to M1, (3) a mechanism M2' that captures
information that is specific to M2. Running M* and M1' together is completely
equivalent to running M1 (both in terms of query answer accuracy and total
privacy cost rho). Similarly, running M* and M2' together is completely
equivalent to running M2.
  Since M* will be used no matter what, the analyst can use its output to
decide whether to subsequently run M1'(thus recreating the analysis supported
by M1) or M2'(recreating the analysis supported by M2), without wasting privacy
loss budget.

correlated with experimental binding affinity measurements compared to prior

that our model, trained only on DEL data, implicitly learns to perform good

problem is based on the displacement method presented in Lukkassen et al. 1995,
Composites Engineering, 5(5), 519-531. We propose the use of the meridional
eccentricity of the permeability tensor ellipsoid as an anisotropy index
quantifying the degree of directionality in the linear magnetic response. As
application problems, 2D regular and random microstructures with overlapping
and nonoverlapping monodisperse disks, all of which are periodic, are
considered. We show that, for the vanishing corrector function, the derived
effective magnetic permeability tensor gives the (lower) Reuss and (upper)
Voigt bounds with the vector and scalar potential formulations, respectively.
Our results with periodic boundary conditions show an excellent agreement with
analytical solutions for regular composites, whereas, for random heterogeneous
materials, their convergence with volume element size is fast. Predictions for
material systems with monodisperse overlapping disks for a given inclusion
volume fraction provide the highest magnetic permeability with the most
increased inclusion interaction. In contrast, the disk arrangements in regular
square lattices result in the lowest magnetic permeability and inadequate
inclusion interaction. Such differences are beyond the reach of the isotropic
effective medium theories, which use only the phase volume fraction and shape
as mere statistical microstructural descriptors.

tip based on polarized optical microscopy (str-POM), the stress analysis
approach to elastomeric fracture uncovers new insights. We show new
phenomenology in contrast to the standard description of linear elastic
fracture mechanics (LEFM). First, str-POM measurements show emergence of a
stress saturation zone whose dimension r_ss is independent of the stress
intensity factor K. This elastic zone is plastic zone whose size would scale
quadratically with K. The absence of stress divergence allows us to measure tip
stress s_tip at the onset of fracture, identified as inherent material
strength, i.e., s_tip(F) = s_F(inh). We are able to explain why LEFM applies
well to elastomers, i.e., why toughness (either given as critical energy
release rate Gc or critical stress intensity factor Kc) is a material constant,
and we have identified parameters that determine the magnitude of toughness.
Second, the popular Rivlin-Thomas energy balance description of elastomeric
fracture in pure shear has acquired a fresh and different interpretation based
on str-POM observations, which show that the stress buildup at cut tip
explicitly scales with specimen height h0, leading to Gc = wch0 being constant.
Third, the str-POM observations reveal how elastomeric fracture occurs at a
common Kc independent of specimen thickness. At a given load there is weaker
stress buildup for a thicker specimen due to greater stress saturation at cut
tip, and fracture is observed to occur at lower tip stress for a thicker
specimen.

One way to resolve this tension is to use an independent way to measure $H_0$.
This can be accomplished by using gravitational-wave (GW) observations.
Previous works have shown that with the onset of the next-generation of GW
detector networks, it will be possible to constrain $H_0$ better than $2\%$
(which is enough to resolve the tension) with binary black hole systems, also
called dark sirens. Bright sirens like binary neutron star systems can also
help resolve the tension if both the GW and the following electromagnetic

destination may look like and to explore the environment based on prior
knowledge of the environmental layout, such as the fact that a bathroom is more

Semi-supervised Pseudo-labeler Anomaly Detection with Ensembling (SPADE) that
isn't limited by the assumption that labeled and unlabeled data come from the

applications - for example, the labeled data may contain only anomalies unlike
unlabeled data, or unlabeled data may contain different types of anomalies, or
labeled data may contain only 'easy-to-label' samples. SPADE utilizes an
ensemble of one class classifiers as the pseudo-labeler to improve the
robustness of pseudo-labeling with distribution mismatch. Partial matching is
proposed to automatically select the critical hyper-parameters for
pseudo-labeling without validation data, which is crucial with limited labeled

stripped-envelope (SE) supernova (SN) 2020wnt, primarily in the optical and
near-infrared (near-IR). Its peak absolute bolometric magnitude of -20.9 mag
and a rise time of 69~days are reminiscent of hydrogen-poor superluminous SNe
(SLSNe~I), luminous transients potentially powered by spinning-down magnetars.
Before the main peak, there is a brief peak lasting <10 days post-explosion,
likely caused by interaction with circumstellar medium (CSM) ejected ~years
before the SN explosion. The optical spectra near peak lack a hot continuum and
OII absorptions, which are signs of heating from a central engine; they
quantitatively resemble those of radioactivity-powered H/He-poor Type Ic SESNe.
At ~1 year after peak, nebular spectra reveal a blue pseudo-continuum and
narrow OI recombination lines associated with magnetar heating. Radio
observations rule out strong CSM interactions as the dominant energy source at
+266 days post peak. Near-IR observations at +200-300 day reveal carbon
monoxide and dust formation, which causes a dramatic optical light curve dip.
Pair-instability explosion models predict slow light curve and spectral
features incompatible with observations. SN 2020wnt is best explained as a
magnetar-powered core-collapse explosion of a 28 Msun pre-SN star. The
explosion kinetic energy is significantly larger than the magnetar energy at
peak, effectively concealing the magnetar-heated inner ejecta until well after
peak. SN 2020wnt falls into a continuum between normal SNe Ic and SLSNe I and
demonstrates that optical spectra at peak alone cannot rule out the presence of
a central engine.

SN 2018aoq. These observations were all conducted at sufficiently late times in
each SN's evolution to demonstrate that the massive-star progenitor candidate
identified in each case in pre-explosion imaging data had indeed vanished and
was therefore most likely the actual progenitor. However, we have determined
for SN 2016gkg that the progenitor candidate was most likely a blend of two
objects: the progenitor, which itself has likely vanished, and another
closely-neighbouring star. We thus provide a revised estimate of that
progenitor's properties: a binary system with a hydrogen-stripped primary star
at explosion with effective temperature ~6300--7900 K, bolometric luminosity
~10^{4.65} L_sun, radius ~118--154 R_sun, and initial mass 9.5--11 M_sun.
Utilising late-time additional archival HST data nearly contemporaneous with
our Snapshots, we also show that SN 2017eaw had a luminous ultraviolet excess,
which is best explained as a result of ongoing interaction of the SN shock with
pre-existing circumstellar matter. We offer the caveat, particularly in the
case of SN 2013ej, that obscuration from SN dust may be compromising our
conclusions. This sample adds to the growing list of confirmed or likely

Many of these tracers originate from dust and gas illuminated by UV photons
from massive stars, so they generally trace both SFR and gas to varying
degrees. We investigate how MIR spectral features from 5 to 35$\mu$m and
photometry from 3.4 to 250$\mu$m correlate with SFR traced by ionized neon
(15.6$\mu$m [Ne III] and 12.8$\mu$m [Ne II]) and molecular gas traced by carbon

another. H$_2$ lines and PAH features correlate best with CO. Fine-structure

them to calibrate new single-parameter MIR tracers of SFR that have negligible

function of CO emission which may be evidence of PAH growth or neutralization

The study of human and animal curiosity, particularly specific curiosity, has
unearthed several properties that would offer important benefits for machine
learners, but that have not yet been well-explored in machine intelligence. In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey of the field of
animal and machine curiosity. As a principal contribution of this work, we use
this survey as a foundation to introduce and define what we consider to be five
of the most important properties of specific curiosity: 1) directedness towards
inostensible referents, 2) cessation when satisfied, 3) voluntary exposure, 4)
transience, and 5) coherent long-term learning. As a second main contribution
of this work, we show how these properties may be implemented together in a
proof-of-concept reinforcement learning agent: we demonstrate how the
properties manifest in the behaviour of this agent in a simple non-episodic
grid-world environment that includes curiosity-inducing locations and induced
targets of curiosity. As we would hope, our example of a computational specific
curiosity agent exhibits short-term directed behaviour while updating long-term
preferences to adaptively seek out curiosity-inducing situations. This work,
therefore, presents a landmark synthesis and translation of specific curiosity
to the domain of machine learning and reinforcement learning and provides a
novel view into how specific curiosity operates and in the future might be
integrated into the behaviour of goal-seeking, decision-making computational
agents in complex environments.

$(1.5+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms that run in
$n^{2-\Theta(\epsilon^{2})}$ time. Our approach is conceptually simple and
diverges from all previous sublinear-time matching algorithms: we show a
sublinear time algorithm for computing a variant of the edge-degree constrained
subgraph (EDCS), a concept that has previously been exploited in dynamic
[Bernstein Stein ICALP'15, SODA'16], distributed [Assadi et al. SODA'19] and
streaming [Bernstein ICALP'20] settings, but never before in the sublinear
setting. Independent work: Behnezhad, Roghani and Rubinstein [BRR'23]
independently showed sublinear algorithms similar to our Theorem 1.2 in both
adjacency list and matrix models. Furthermore, in [BRR'23], they show
additional results on strictly better-than-1.5 approximate matching algorithms
in both upper and lower bound sides.

challenging because of the complexities of real-world environments and highly
dynamic motions. Previous works based on neural radiance fields have
demonstrated high-quality reconstructions of dynamic scenes. However, training
such models on real-world scenes is time-consuming, usually taking days or
weeks. In this paper, we present a novel method named MixVoxels to better
represent the dynamic scenes with fast training speed and competitive rendering
qualities. The proposed MixVoxels represents the 4D dynamic scenes as a mixture
of static and dynamic voxels and processes them with different networks. In
this way, the computation of the required modalities for static voxels can be
processed by a lightweight model, which essentially reduces the amount of
computation, especially for many daily dynamic scenes dominated by the static
background. To separate the two kinds of voxels, we propose a novel variation
field to estimate the temporal variance of each voxel. For the dynamic voxels,
we design an inner-product time query method to efficiently query multiple time
steps, which is essential to recover the high-dynamic motions. As a result,
with 15 minutes of training for dynamic scenes with inputs of 300-frame videos,
MixVoxels achieves better PSNR than previous methods. Codes and trained models

optical waveguides with a 3rd-order exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) is
advanced. The frozen mode regime in a lossless and gainless waveguide is
associated with a stationary inflection point (SIP) in the Bloch dispersion
relation, where three Bloch eigenmodes coalesce forming the frozen mode. As a
practical example, we consider an asymmetric serpentine optical waveguide
(ASOW). An ASOW operating near the SIP frequency displays a large group delay
of a non-resonant nature that scales as the cube of the waveguide length,
leading to a strong gain enhancement when active material is included.
Therefore, a laser operating in the close vicinity of an SIP has a gain
threshold that scales as a negative cube of the waveguide length. We determine
that this scaling law is maintained in the presence of small distributed
losses, such as radiation associated with waveguide bends and roughness. In
addition, we show that although gain causes a distortion in the modes
coalescing at the SIP, the properties of the frozen mode are relatively
resistant to such small perturbations and we still observe a large degree of
exceptional degeneracy for gain values that bring the system above threshold.
Finally, our study also reveals that lasing near an SIP is favored over lasing
near a photonic band edge located in close proximity to the SIP. In particular,
we observe that an SIP-induced lasing in an ASOW displays lower gain threshold
compared to lasing near the photonic regular band edge (RBE), even though the
SIP resonance has a lower quality factor than the RBE resonance.

be very effective in inducing reasoning capabilities in large language models.
However, the success of the CoT approach is fundamentally tied to the model

In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation approach that leverages the
step-by-step CoT reasoning capabilities of larger models and distills these
abilities into smaller models.
  In this work, we propose an alternative reasoning scheme, Socratic CoT, that
learns a decomposition of the original problem into a sequence of subproblems
and uses it to guide the intermediate reasoning steps. We use Socratic CoT to
train a combination of two small distilled models: a problem decomposer and a
subproblem solver. In practice, given a new problem, the two distilled models
work in sync to decompose and solve complex problems. On multiple reasoning
datasets (GSM8K, StrategyQA, and SVAMP), our proposed distillation strategies
boosts the performance of smaller models over 70% compared to the baselines.
Finally, we investigate when Socratic CoT is an effective alternative to CoT,
demonstrating cases where a much smaller model (GPT-2 large) can outperform a

that unitarity is satisfied to very high precision if suitable conditions are
met. If the internal black hole dynamics is described by a pseudorandom unitary
transformation, and if the operations performed by the infaller have
computational complexity scaling polynomially with the black hole entropy, then
the $S$-matrix is unitary up to corrections that are superpolynomially small in

undergo shock revival and their explosion energies asymptote within a few
hundred milliseconds to values of $\gtrsim 2\times10^{51}$ erg after
conservatively correcting for the binding energy of the envelope. Magnetically
collimated, non-relativistic jets form in both models, though the jets are
subject to non-axisymmetric instabilities. The jets do not appear crucial for
driving the explosion, as they only emerge once the shock has already expanded
considerably. Our simulations predict moderate neutron star kicks of about
$150\, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, no spin-kick alignment, and rapid early
spin-down that would result in birth periods of about $20\, \mathrm{ms}$, too
slow to power an energetic gamma-ray burst jet. More than $0.2\,M_\odot$ of

bursts at cosmological distances. While young magnetars have been put forward
as the leading source candidate, recent observations suggest there may be
multiple FRB progenitor classes. It has long been theorised that FRBs could be
emitted from compact object mergers - cataclysmic events such as binary neutron
star (BNS) mergers that may be detectable in gravitational waves (GWs) by the
ground-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)and
Virgo. Here we report a potential coincidence between the only BNS merger event
GW190425 out of 21 GW sources detected during the first six months of
LIGO-Virgo's 3rd Science Run and a bright, non-repeating FRB event, FRB
20190425A, from a search using public GW and CHIME FRB data. The FRB is located
within the GW's sky localization area, occurred 2.5 hours after the GW event,
and has a dispersion measure consistent with the distance inferred from GW
parameter estimation. The chance probability of a coincidence between unrelated
FRB and GW events in the databases is estimated to be 0.0052 ($2.8 \sigma$). We
estimate the chance of CHIME detecting such an event to range from 0.4% for a
beam-centre detection to 68% if a bright burst is detectable in a far sidelobe.
This potential association is consistent with the theory that the BNS merger
leaves behind a supramassive, highly magnetized compact object, which collapses
to form a black hole after losing angular momentum due to spindown and makes an
FRB through ejecting the magnetosphere. If such a physical association is
established, the equation of state of the post-merger compact object is likely
stiff, with a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff non-spinning maximum mass $M_{TOV} >
2.63_{-0.23}^{+0.39} M_\odot$ for a neutron star remnant, or $M_{TOV} >

complicate the flow behavior. The current state of theoretical and

pole mass $M_{\rm{pole}}^2$ and volume due to systematic errors coming from
finite volume effect and higher-order contamination of the Taylor expansion of
the form factor. We circumvent this difficulty by introducing a new appropriate
function and propose a modified method that can calculate the pion charge
radius with less systematic errors in the small $M_{\rm{pole}}^2$ and volume
cases. As preliminary results, we check that our improved model-independent
method works well on a mockup data and also an actual lattice QCD data at the
pion mass of 0.51 GeV.

Existing works mainly fall into two distinctive categories: variational and

discovered options through a mutual information loss but overlooks coverage of
the state space, while the latter focuses on improving the coverage of options
by increasing connectivity during exploration, but does not consider diversity.
In this paper, we propose a unified framework that quantifies diversity and

enables unsupervised option discovery explicitly optimizing both objectives.
Specifically, we define the DPP kernel matrix with the Laplacian spectrum of

the corpus. Different needs correspond to different IR tasks such as document
retrieval, open-domain question answering, retrieval-based dialogue, etc.,
while they share the same schema to estimate the relationship between texts. It
indicates that a good IR model can generalize to different tasks and domains.
However, previous studies indicate that state-of-the-art neural information
retrieval (NIR) models, e.g, pre-trained language models (PLMs) are hard to
generalize. Mainly because the end-to-end fine-tuning paradigm makes the model
overemphasize task-specific signals and domain biases but loses the ability to
capture generalized essential signals. To address this problem, we propose a
novel NIR training framework named NIR-Prompt for retrieval and reranking
stages based on the idea of decoupling signal capturing and combination.
NIR-Prompt exploits Essential Matching Module (EMM) to capture the essential
matching signals and gets the description of tasks by Matching Description
Module (MDM). The description is used as task-adaptation information to combine
the essential matching signals to adapt to different tasks. Experiments under
in-domain multi-task, out-of-domain multi-task, and new task adaptation
settings show that NIR-Prompt can improve the generalization of PLMs in NIR for
both retrieval and reranking stages compared with baselines.

  Guided Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder","Findings of EMNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex dialogue mappings (CDM), including one-to-many and many-to-one
mappings, tend to make dialogue models generate incoherent or dull responses,
and modeling these mappings remains a huge challenge for neural dialogue
systems. To alleviate these problems, methods like introducing external
information, reconstructing the optimization function, and manipulating data
samples are proposed, while they primarily focus on avoiding training with CDM,
inevitably weakening the model's ability of understanding CDM in human
conversations and limiting further improvements in model performance. This
paper proposes a Sentence Semantic \textbf{Seg}mentation guided
\textbf{C}onditional \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder
(SegCVAE) method which can model and take advantages of the CDM data.
Specifically, to tackle the incoherent problem caused by one-to-many, SegCVAE
uses response-related prominent semantics to constrained the latent variable.
To mitigate the non-diverse problem brought by many-to-one, SegCVAE segments
multiple prominent semantics to enrich the latent variables. Three novel
components, Internal Separation, External Guidance, and Semantic Norms, are
proposed to achieve SegCVAE. On dialogue generation tasks, both the automatic
and human evaluation results show that SegCVAE achieves new state-of-the-art

We formulate a universal optimization problem for maximizing either the average

reduce computational complexity with minor accuracy loss. A special property
called correlation dispersion is analyzed. It is capable of eliminating the
spatial consistency that incurs inaccuracy to traditional positioning methods.

demonstrated to achieve similar accuracy as the centralized learning model. In
SL with multiple clients, the local training weights are shared between clients
for local model aggregation. This paper investigates the potential of data
leakage due to local weight sharing among the clients in SL by performing model
inversion attacks. To mitigate the identified leakage issue, we propose and
analyze privacy-enhancement SL (P-SL), e.g., SL without local weight sharing,
to boost client-side data privacy. We also propose paralleled P-SL to speed up
the training process by employing multiple servers without accuracy reduction.
Finally, we investigate P-SL with late participating clients and develop a
server-based cache-based training to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL.
Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of
client-side data leakage compared to SL. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based
version achieve comparable accuracy to SL under various data distributions with
lower computation and communications costs. Also, caching in P-SL reduces the
negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables effective

transfer through the detector wall that induced buoyant flow in a thin wall

authentication technology, which is one of the most critical complements of
upper layer authentication. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF)-based SEI is to
distinguish one emitter from each other by immutable RF characteristics from
electronic components. Due to the powerful ability of deep learning (DL) to
extract hidden features and perform classification, it can extract highly
separative features from massive signal samples, thus enabling SEI. Considering
the condition of limited training samples, we propose a novel few-shot SEI
(FS-SEI) method based on hybrid data augmentation and deep metric learning
(HDA-DML) which gets rid of the dependence on auxiliary datasets. Specifically,
HDA consisting rotation and CutMix is designed to increase data diversity, and
DML is used to extract high discriminative semantic features. The proposed
HDA-DML-based FS-SEI method is evaluated on an open source large-scale
real-world automatic-dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) dataset and a
real-world WiFi dataset. The simulation results of two datasets show that the
proposed method achieves better identification performance and higher feature
discriminability than five latest FS-SEI methods.

single agent distributed deep reinforcement learning to the most complex
multiple players multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, we review recently released toolboxes that help to realize
distributed deep reinforcement learning without many modifications of their

polar codes. This can result in improving the error correction performance of
(near) maximum likelihood (ML) decoders such as sequential decoders and sphere
decoders. However, PAC codes cannot be decoded by sphere decoding. The reason
is twofold: 1) Sphere decoding of polar codes is performed from the last bit -
due to the lower rectangular shape of the polar transform. Whereas the shape of
PAC codes generator matrix is no longer triangular. 2) One may modify the
precoding matrix to get a lower-triangular shape. However, this may reduce the

only represent data on finite meshgrid due to their intrinsical discrete
nature, which hinders their potential applicability in many scenarios beyond
meshgrid. To break this barrier, we propose a low-rank tensor function
representation (LRTFR), which can continuously represent data beyond meshgrid
with infinite resolution. Specifically, the suggested tensor function, which
maps an arbitrary coordinate to the corresponding value, can continuously
represent data in an infinite real space. Parallel to discrete tensors, we
develop two fundamental concepts for tensor functions, i.e., the tensor
function rank and low-rank tensor function factorization. We theoretically
justify that both low-rank and smooth regularizations are harmoniously unified
in the LRTFR, which leads to high effectiveness and efficiency for data
continuous representation. Extensive multi-dimensional data recovery
applications arising from image processing (image inpainting and denoising),
machine learning (hyperparameter optimization), and computer graphics (point

who own information are often self-interested and require incentives to reveal
their information. Suitable mechanisms are required to elicit and aggregate
such distributed information for decision making. In this paper, we use
simulations to investigate the use of decision markets as mechanisms in a
multi-agent learning system to aggregate distributed information for
decision-making in a contextual bandit problem. The system utilises strictly
proper decision scoring rules to assess the accuracy of probabilistic reports
from agents, which allows agents to learn to solve the contextual bandit
problem jointly. Our simulations show that our multi-agent system with
distributed information can be trained as efficiently as a centralised
counterpart with a single agent that receives all information. Moreover, we use
our system to investigate scenarios with deterministic decision scoring rules
which are not incentive compatible. We observe the emergence of more complex
dynamics with manipulative behaviour, which agrees with existing theoretical
analyses.

accelerated advancements in computer vision, bringing changes into our daily
practice. Furthermore, the standardized deep learning modules (also known as
backbone networks), i.e., ResNet and EfficientNet, have enabled efficient and
rapid development of new computer vision solutions. Yet, deep learning methods
still suffer from several drawbacks. One of the most concerning problems is the
high memory and computational cost, such that dedicated computing units,
typically GPUs, have to be used for training and development. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a quantifiable evaluation method, the convolutional
kernel redundancy measure, which is based on perceived image differences, for
guiding the network structure simplification. When applying our method to the
chest X-ray image classification problem with ResNet, our method can maintain
the performance of the network and reduce the number of parameters from over
$23$ million to approximately $128$ thousand (reducing $99.46\%$ of the

thermodynamically for both $s-$wave and $d-$wave pairing symmetries, and

this argument sounds, it is incomplete. We find royalties can add value to
creators in at least three distinct ways. (i) Risk sharing: when creators and
buyers are risk sensitive, royalties can improve trade by splitting the risks
associated with future price volatility; (ii) Dynamic pricing: in the presence
of information asymmetry, royalties can extract more revenues from
better-informed speculators over time, mimicking the benefits of ``dynamic
pricing''; (iii) Price discrimination: when creators sell multi-unit NFT
collections, royalties can better capture value from heterogeneous buyers. Our
results suggest creator royalties play an important and sometimes overlooked
role in the economics of NFTs.

applied to model event data with dependence on past occurrences and interaction
phenomena. In the generalised nonlinear model, positive and negative
interactions between the components of the process are allowed, therefore
accounting for so-called excitation and inhibition effects. In the
nonparametric setting, learning the temporal dependence structure of Hawkes
processes is often a computationally expensive task, all the more with Bayesian
estimation methods. In general, the posterior distribution in the nonlinear
Hawkes model is non-conjugate and doubly intractable. Moreover, existing
Monte-Carlo Markov Chain methods are often slow and not scalable to
high-dimensional processes in practice. Recently, efficient algorithms
targeting a mean-field variational approximation of the posterior distribution
have been proposed. In this work, we unify existing variational Bayes inference
approaches under a general framework, that we theoretically analyse under
easily verifiable conditions on the prior, the variational class, and the
model. We notably apply our theory to a novel spike-and-slab variational class,
that can induce sparsity through the connectivity graph parameter of the
multivariate Hawkes model. Then, in the context of the popular sigmoid Hawkes
model, we leverage existing data augmentation technique and design adaptive and
sparsity-inducing mean-field variational methods. In particular, we propose a
two-step algorithm based on a thresholding heuristic to select the graph
parameter. Through an extensive set of numerical simulations, we demonstrate
that our approach enjoys several benefits: it is computationally efficient, can
reduce the dimensionality of the problem by selecting the graph parameter, and
is able to adapt to the smoothness of the underlying parameter.

entailment (TE) has been shown as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach to
dealing with those selection problems. TE treats input texts as premises (P),
options as hypotheses (H), then handles the selection problem by modeling (P,
H) pairwise. Two limitations: first, the pairwise modeling is unaware of other
options, which is less intuitive since humans often determine the best options
by comparing competing candidates; second, the inference process of pairwise TE
is time-consuming, especially when the option space is large. To deal with the
two issues, this work first proposes a contextualized TE model (Context-TE) by
appending other k options as the context of the current (P, H) modeling.
Context-TE is able to learn more reliable decision for the H since it considers
various context. Second, we speed up Context-TE by coming up with Parallel-TE,
which learns the decisions of multiple options simultaneously. Parallel-TE
significantly improves the inference speed while keeping comparable performance
with Context-TE. Our methods are evaluated on three tasks (ultra-fine entity

security screening. Several popular object detection networks have been used
for PMMW images. However, restricted by the low resolution and high noise of
PMMW images, PMMW hidden object detection based on deep learning usually
suffers from low accuracy and low classification confidence. To tackle the
above problems, this paper proposes a Task-Aligned Detection Transformer
network, named PMMW-DETR. In the first stage, a Denoising Coarse-to-Fine
Transformer (DCFT) backbone is designed to extract long- and short-range
features in the different scales. In the second stage, we propose the Query
Selection module to introduce learned spatial features into the network as
prior knowledge, which enhances the semantic perception capability of the
network. In the third stage, aiming to improve the classification performance,
we perform a Task-Aligned Dual-Head block to decouple the classification and
regression tasks. Based on our self-developed PMMW security screening dataset,
experimental results including comparison with State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods
and ablation study demonstrate that the PMMW-DETR obtains higher accuracy and
classification confidence than previous works, and exhibits robustness to the
PMMW images of low quality.

collaboration in training machine learning models. Industrial frameworks adopt
secure multi-party computation methods such as homomorphic encryption to
guarantee data security and privacy. However, a line of work has revealed that
there are still leakage risks in VFL. The leakage is caused by the correlation
between the intermediate representations and the raw data. Due to the powerful
approximation ability of deep neural networks, an adversary can capture the
correlation precisely and reconstruct the data. To deal with the threat of the
data reconstruction attack, we propose a hashing-based VFL framework, called
\textit{HashVFL}, to cut off the reversibility directly. The one-way nature of
hashing allows our framework to block all attempts to recover data from hash
codes. However, integrating hashing also brings some challenges, e.g., the loss
of information. This paper proposes and addresses three challenges to
integrating hashing: learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental
results demonstrate \textit{HashVFL}'s efficiency in keeping the main task's
performance and defending against data reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we
also analyze its potential value in detecting abnormal inputs. In addition, we
conduct extensive experiments to prove \textit{HashVFL}'s generalization in
various settings. In summary, \textit{HashVFL} provides a new perspective on
protecting multi-party's data security and privacy in VFL. We hope our study
can attract more researchers to expand the application domains of

general public in recent years. As one way to implement privacy-preserving AI,
differentially private learning is a framework that enables AI models to use
differential privacy (DP). To achieve DP in the learning process, existing
algorithms typically limit the magnitude of gradients with a constant clipping,
which requires carefully tuned due to its significant impact on model
performance. As a solution to this issue, latest works NSGD and Auto-S
innovatively propose to use normalization instead of clipping to avoid
hyperparameter tuning. However, normalization-based approaches like NSGD and
Auto-S rely on a monotonic weight function, which imposes excessive weight on
small gradient samples and introduces extra deviation to the update. In this
paper, we propose a Differentially Private Per-Sample Adaptive Clipping
(DP-PSAC) algorithm based on a non-monotonic adaptive weight function, which
guarantees privacy without the typical hyperparameter tuning process of using a
constant clipping while significantly reducing the deviation between the update
and true batch-averaged gradient. We provide a rigorous theoretical convergence
analysis and show that with convergence rate at the same order, the proposed
algorithm achieves a lower non-vanishing bound, which is maintained over
training iterations, compared with NSGD/Auto-S. In addition, through extensive
experimental evaluation, we show that DP-PSAC outperforms or matches the
state-of-the-art methods on multiple main-stream vision and language tasks.

can be extracted from a speaker's speech, and the TD and the FD features can be
considered as the linear mixtures of independent feature components (IFCs) with
an unknown mixing system. To estimate the IFCs, the TD and the FD features of
the speaker's speech are concatenated to build the TD and the FD feature
matrix, respectively. Then, a feature tensor of the speaker's speech is
obtained by paralleling the TD and the FD feature matrix. To enhance the
dependence on different feature types and remove the redundancies of the same
feature type, the independent vector analysis (IVA) can be used to estimate the
IFC matrices of TD and FD features with the feature tensor. The IFC matrices
are utilized as the input of the PCNN to extract the deep features of the TD

the fusion feature of the speaker's speech. Finally, the fusion feature of the
speaker's speech is employed as the input of a deep convolutional neural

show the effectiveness and performances of the proposed speaker recognition
system.

  misalignment control using actuator line model","18 pages, 16 figures,2 tables",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Yaw control has proven to be promising in alleviating the wake effects that
plague the efficiency of wind farms. In this work, the actuator line modeling
(ALM) method is adopted to simulate the flows over two tandem turbines
distanced by $3 - 7$ rotor diameters, with the yaw angle of the upstream rotor
varying from $\gamma_1=0^{\circ}$ to $50^{\circ}$. The aim is to provide a
comprehensive aerodynamic characterization of a simple wind farm under yaw
misalignment. With increasing yaw angle, the power generated by the downstream
rotor increases, compensating the power loss in the upstream rotor, and
resulting in higher total power of the two turbines than that without yaw
control. The maximum power output is achieved as the upstream wake of the yawed
rotor is redirected away from the downstream rotor plane. Behind the downstream
rotor, the secondary steering phenomenon is observed, where the wake is also
redirected from the centerline. The use of the actuator line model also reveal
unsteady aerodynamic characteristics that can not be captured by lower-fidelity
models. For the upstream rotor, the yaw misalignment results in time-varying
change in the local angle of attack on the blade, giving rise to unsteady
loading. The downstream rotor is partially submerged in the deflected wake
incurred by the yawed upstream rotor. As the blade revolves into and out of the
wake deficit, the blade experiences cyclic loading, leading to even stronger
fluctuations in the aerodynamic loads than the upstream rotor. These analysis
provides a comprehensive understanding of the yaw control effects on the two
tandem rotors from the perspectives of aerodynamic performance, wake profiles,
and unsteady characteristics. The insights gained from the study can aid the
design of collective yaw control strategies of wind farms, and lay the
foundation for assessing the fatigue damage associated with yaw misalignment.

which adds extra constraints on the set of feasible couplings in the original

numerous applications, e.g., finance, network flow. However, due to the large
number of constraints in this problem, existing algorithms are both
time-consuming and space-consuming. In this paper, inspired by entropic
regularization for the classical optimal transport problem, we introduce a
novel regularization term for capacity constrained optimal transport. The
regularized problem naturally satisfies the capacity constraints and
consequently makes it possible to analyze the duality. Unlike the matrix-vector
multiplication in the alternate iteration scheme for solving classical optimal
transport, in our algorithm, each alternate iteration step is to solve several
single-variable equations. Fortunately, we find that each of these equations
corresponds to a single-variable monotonic function, and we convert solving
these equations into finding the unique zero point of each single-variable
monotonic function with Newton's method. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method has a significant advantage in terms of
accuracy, efficiency, and memory consumption compared with existing methods.

Earth is computationally expensive. We present a fictitious wave domain
high-order finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modelling method on nonuniform
grids to compute frequency-domain 3D controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM)
data. The method overcomes the inconsistency issue widely present in the
conventional 2nd order staggered grid finite difference scheme over nonuniform
grid, achieving high accuracy with arbitrarily high order scheme. The
finite-difference coefficients adaptive to the node spacings, can be accurately
computed by inverting a Vandermonde matrix system using efficient algorithm. A
generic stability condition applicable to nonuniform grids is established,
revealing the dependence of the time step and these finite-difference
coefficients. A recursion scheme using fixed point iterations is designed to
determine the stretching factor to generate the optimal nonuniform grid. The
grid stretching in our method reduces the number of grid points required in the
discretization, making it more efficient than the standard high-order FDTD with
a densely sampled uniform grid. Instead of stretching in both vertical and
horizontal directions, better accuracy of our method is observed when the grid
is stretched along the depth without horizontal stretching. The efficiency and
accuracy of our method are demonstrated by numerical examples.

applications, including navigation for autonomous driving of robots and drones,
augmented reality (AR), and 3D modeling. This task often combines traditional
image/video processing algorithms and deep neural networks (DNNs). Although
recent developments in deep learning have improved the accuracy of the task,
the large number of calculations involved results in low computation speed and
high power consumption. Although there are various domain-specific hardware
accelerators for DNNs, it is not easy to accelerate the entire process of
applications that alternate between traditional image/video processing
algorithms and DNNs. Thus, FPGA-based end-to-end acceleration is required for
such complicated applications in low-power embedded environments.
  This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based accelerator for DeepVideoMVS, a
DNN-based depth estimation method for 3D reconstruction. We employ HW/SW
co-design to appropriately utilize heterogeneous components in modern SoC
FPGAs, such as programmable logic (PL) and CPU, according to the inherent
characteristics of the method. As some operations are unsuitable for hardware
implementation, we determine the operations to be implemented in software
through analyzing the number of times each operation is performed and its
memory access pattern, and then considering comprehensive aspects: the ease of
hardware implementation and degree of expected acceleration by hardware. The
hardware and software implementations are executed in parallel on the PL and
CPU to hide their execution latencies. The proposed accelerator was developed
on a Xilinx ZCU104 board by using NNgen, an open-source high-level synthesis
(HLS) tool. Experiments showed that the proposed accelerator operates 60.2
times faster than the software-only implementation on the same FPGA board with
minimal accuracy degradation.

nonferrimagnetic materials suggest that the magnetization of the system is not
a critical component for the realization of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
Here, we present a combined theoretical and experimental study demonstrating
the evolution of different mechanisms of AHE in a cubic Heusler system
MnPt$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$Sn. With the help of magnetization and neutron diffraction
studies, we show that the substitution of nonmagnetic Ir in place of Pt
significantly reduces the net magnetic moment from 4.17 $ \mu _B$/f.u. in
MnPtSn to 2.78 $ \mu _B$/f.u. for MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. In contrast, the
anomalous Hall resistivity is enhanced by nearly three times from 1.6 $ \mu
\Omega $ cm in MnPtSn to about 5 $ \mu \Omega $ cm for
MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The power law analysis of the Hall resistivity data
suggests that the extrinsic contribution of AHE that dominates in the case of
the parent MnPtSn almost vanishes for MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn, where the
intrinsic mechanism plays the major role. The experimental results are well
supported by our theoretical study, which shows a considerable enhancement of
the spin-orbit coupling when Ir is introduced into the system. Our finding of a
crossover of the anomalous Hall effect with chemical engineering is a major

Lyapunov function. Value iteration, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP)

we merge the results of terminally unconstrained predictive control and
approximate value iteration to draw benefits from both fields. A prediction
horizon is derived in dependence on different factors such as
approximation-related errors to render the closed-loop asymptotically stable
further allowing a suboptimality estimate in comparison to an infinite horizon

taking successive moments of the Boltzmann radiative transfer equation, are

precisely, for a positive integer $q$, let $X_q$ denote the set of all

period $q$. Then for any finite set of pairwise co-prime natural numbers $q_i,
1\le i \le \ell$ with $(q_1 \cdots q_{\ell}, ~\varphi(q_1)\cdots

result of Okada about linear independence of the cotangent values over
$\mathbb{Q}$ as well as a result of Murty-Murty about $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$

neglected yet very meaningful task that aims for optimal transfer of labelled
scene text images while handling unlabelled images in various new domains.
Specifically, we design SCAST, a subcategory-aware self-training technique that
mitigates the network overfitting and noisy pseudo labels in domain adaptive
scene text detection effectively. SCAST consists of two novel designs. For
labelled source data, it introduces pseudo subcategories for both foreground
texts and background stuff which helps train more generalizable source models
with multi-class detection objectives. For unlabelled target data, it mitigates
the network overfitting by co-regularizing the binary and subcategory

achieves superior detection performance consistently across multiple public
benchmarks, and it also generalizes well to other domain adaptive detection
tasks such as vehicle detection.

presence of background rotational flows. Here, we investigate the behaviour of
$m=0$ and $m=\pm 1$ modes of a magnetic flux tube in the presence of linear
background rotational flows embedded in a photospheric environment. We show
that the inclusion of a background rotational flow is found to have little
effect on the obtained eigensolutions for the axisymmetric $m=0$ sausage mode.
However, solutions for the kink mode are dependent on the location of the flow
resonance modified by the slow frequency. A background rotational flow causes
the modified flow resonances to possess faster phase speeds in the thin-tube
(TT) limit for the case $m=1$. This results in solutions for the slow body and
slow surface kink modes to follow this trajectory, changing their dispersive
behaviour. For a photospheric flux tube in the TT limit, we show that it
becomes difficult to distinguish between the slow surface and fast surface kink
($m=1$) modes upon comparison of their eigenfunctions. 2D velocity field plots
demonstrate how these waves, in the presence of background rotational flows,
may appear in observational data. For slow body kink modes, a swirling pattern
can be seen in the total pressure perturbation. Furthermore, the tube boundary
undergoes a helical motion from the breaking of azimuthal symmetry, where the
$m=1$ and $m=-1$ modes become out of phase, suggesting the resulting kink wave
is circularly polarised. These results may have implications for seismology of
magnetohydrodynamic waves in solar magnetic vortices.

different types of impurities. We find that the magnetoresistance can also be
linear for the quadratic energy dispersion. We show that both longitudinal and
transverse magnetoresistance can be linear if long-range-Gaussian-type

transverse magnetoresistance. Our findings well explain some of the linear

critical for diagnosis, yet existing (non-deep learning) methods are limited by
a reliance on prior topological knowledge of the expected tree-like structures.
As the structure such vascular systems is often difficult to conceptualize,
graph-based representations have become popular due to their ability to capture
the geometric and topological properties of the morphology in an
orientation-independent and abstract manner. However, graph-based learning for
automated labeling of tree-like anatomical structures has received limited
attention in the literature. The majority of prior studies have limitations in
the entity graph construction, are dependent on topological structures, and
have limited accuracy due to the anatomical variability between subjects. In
this paper, we propose an intuitive graph representation method, well suited to
use with 3D coordinate data obtained from angiography scans. We subsequently
seek to analyze subject-specific graphs using geometric deep learning. The
proposed models leverage expert annotated labels from 141 patients to learn
representations of each coronary segment, while capturing the effects of
anatomical variability within the training data. We investigate different
variants of so-called message passing neural networks. Through extensive
evaluations, our pipeline achieves a promising weighted F1-score of 0.805 for
labeling coronary artery (13 classes) for a five-fold cross-validation.
Considering the ability of graph models in dealing with irregular data, and
their scalability for data segmentation, this work highlights the potential of
such methods to provide quantitative evidence to support the decisions of

soccer by using reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, an agent interacts with an
environment and learns to choose an action in a state at each step. When
training RL algorithms, a problem called the curse of dimensionality (COD) can
occur if the dimension of the state is high and the number of training data is
low. The COD often causes degraded performance of RL models. In the situation
of the robot kicking the ball, as the ball approaches the robot, the robot
chooses the action based on the information obtained from the soccer field. In
order not to suffer COD, the training data, which are experiences in the case
of RL, should be collected evenly from all areas of the soccer field over
(theoretically infinite) time. In this paper, we attempt to use the relative
coordinate system (RCS) as the state for training kick-motion of robot agent,
instead of using the absolute coordinate system (ACS). Using the RCS eliminates
the necessity for the agent to know all the (state) information of entire
soccer field and reduces the dimension of the state that the agent needs to
know to perform kick-motion, and consequently alleviates COD. The training
based on the RCS is performed with the widely used Deep Q-network (DQN) and
tested in the AI Soccer environment implemented with Webots simulation
software.

homogeneous 26Al is not falsified. This age, defined to be when the solar
nebula had (26Al/27Al) = 5.23 x 10^-5, is significantly older than the ~4567.3
Myr inferred from direct measurements of Pb-Pb ages in CAIs. Discrepancies
between the Al-Mg and Pb-Pb chronometers in chondrules and CAIs have previously
been interpreted as arising from heterogeneities in 26Al, under the presumption
that the Al-Mg and Pb-Pb systems in CAIs closed simultaneously. We examine this
assumption and show that resetting is to be expected in CAIs. In particular, we
quantitatively demonstrate that it is plausible that Pb-Pb ages of CAIs were
reset at late times, without resetting the earlier Al-Mg ages, if they were
transiently heated in the same manner as chondrules. We critically examine
Pb-Pb isochrons, refining data and suggesting best practices for their
calculation and reporting. We advocate reporting chronometry as times of
formation after t=0 rather than absolute ages, as only the former is useful for
astrophysical models of the solar nebula. We strongly advocate averaging of
multiple samples, rather than anchoring to individual meteorites, to improve
precision.

systems with classical inputs have been obtained using the density matrix

system isomorphisms are established that unify the density matrix approach to
QRC with the representation in the space of observables using Bloch vectors
associated with Gell-Mann bases. It is shown that these vector representations
yield state-affine systems (SAS) previously introduced in the classical
reservoir computing literature and for which numerous theoretical results have
been established. This connection is used to show that various statements in
relation to the fading memory (FMP) and the echo state (ESP) properties are
independent of the representation, and also to shed some light on fundamental
questions in QRC theory in finite dimensions. In particular, a necessary and
sufficient condition for the ESP and FMP to hold is formulated using standard
hypotheses, and contractive quantum channels that have exclusively trivial
semi-infinite solutions are characterized in terms of the existence of
input-independent fixed points.

a novel method for safe multi-robot control under uncertainty. The scope of our
approach is to blend covariance steering theory, distributed optimization and
model predictive control (MPC) into a single methodology that is safe, scalable
and decentralized. Initially, we pose a problem formulation that uses the
Wasserstein distance to steer the state distributions of a multi-robot team to
desired targets, and probabilistic constraints to ensure safety. We then
transform this problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one by utilizing
a disturbance feedback policy parametrization for covariance steering and a
tractable approximation of the safety constraints. To solve the latter problem,
we derive a decentralized consensus-based algorithm using the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This method is then extended to a
receding horizon form, which yields the proposed DMPCS algorithm. Simulation
experiments on large-scale problems with up to hundreds of robots successfully
demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of DMPCS. Its superior capability
in achieving safety is also highlighted through a comparison against a standard
stochastic MPC approach. A video with all simulation experiments is available

deep neural networks (DNNs) to reuse historical experiences as efficiently as
humans. This ability is named knowledge transferability. A commonly used
paradigm for DTL is firstly learning general knowledge (pre-training) and then
reusing (fine-tuning) them for a specific target task. There are two
consensuses of transferability of pre-trained DNNs: (1) a larger domain gap
between pre-training and downstream data brings lower transferability; (2) the
transferability gradually decreases from lower layers (near input) to higher
layers (near output). However, these consensuses were basically drawn from the
experiments based on natural images, which limits their scope of application.
This work aims to study and complement them from a broader perspective by
proposing a method to measure the transferability of pre-trained DNN
parameters. Our experiments on twelve diverse image classification datasets get
similar conclusions to the previous consensuses. More importantly, two new
findings are presented, i.e., (1) in addition to the domain gap, a larger data
amount and huge dataset diversity of downstream target task also prohibit the
transferability; (2) although the lower layers learn basic image features, they
are usually not the most transferable layers due to their domain sensitivity.

individual objects. After the end of the nuclear burning interval, the X-ray
emission drops significantly, fading by a factor of around 10-100. The UV
changes, however, are of a lower amplitude, declining by 1-2 mag over the same

show that quantum systems satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
can simultaneously provide thermalized ensemble expectation values and
nonthermalized weak values of the momentum, both from the same operational
probability distribution. The reason why weak values of the momentum may escape
from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is because they are linked only
to off-diagonal elements of the density matrix in the energy representation.
For indistinguishable particles, however, operational properties can not be
defined in the configuration space. Therefore, we state that the origin of the
arrow of time in isolated quantum systems described by the Schroedinger
equation comes from dealing with properties obtained by averaging (tracing out)
some degrees of freedom of the configuration space. We then argue that
thermalization does not occur in the properties defined in the configuration

real phenomenon in the properties defined in the physical space. All of these
conclusions are testable in the laboratory through many-body weak values.

EQAS, each layout of quantum circuits, i.e quantum circuit architecture(QCA),

Then, an algorithm to remove the redundant parameters in QCA is performed
according to the eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum Fisher information

the sampling rate could be obtained to sample the parent generation by the
Roulette Wheel selection strategy. Thereafter, the mutation and crossover are
applied to get the next generation. EQAS is verified by the classification task

pipeline for detecting insects in time-lapse RGB-images. The pipeline consists
of a two-step process. Firstly, the time-lapse RGB-images are preprocessed to
enhance insects in the images. We propose a new prepossessing enhancement
method: Motion-Informed-enhancement. The technique uses motion and colors to
enhance insects in images. The enhanced images are subsequently fed into a

between the characteristics of living entities and their respective survival
times, taking into account the partial information held by censored cases. A
good analysis can, for example, determine whether one medical treatment for a
group of patients is better than another. With the rise of machine learning,
survival analysis can be modeled as learning a function that maps studied
patients to their survival times. To succeed with that, there are three crucial
issues to be tackled. First, some patient data is censored: we do not know the
true survival times for all patients. Second, data is scarce, which led past
research to treat different illness types as domains in a multi-task setup.
Third, there is the need for adaptation to new or extremely rare illness types,
where little or no labels are available. In contrast to previous multi-task
setups, we want to investigate how to efficiently adapt to a new survival
target domain from multiple survival source domains. For this, we introduce a
new survival metric and the corresponding discrepancy measure between survival
distributions. These allow us to define domain adaptation for survival analysis
while incorporating censored data, which would otherwise have to be dropped.
Our experiments on two cancer data sets reveal a superb performance on target
domains, a better treatment recommendation, and a weight matrix with a
plausible explanation.

that evolution must proceed rather slowly, in accordance with the earlier views

information expressed in some part of the phenotype of a species cannot
increase faster than a given rate, determined by the selection pressure on that
part. This rate is typically a small fraction of a bit per generation"". This
result was derived in the presence of sexual reproduction and other effects
such as temporarily isolated sub-populations. In 1999 David Mackay published a
paper which apparently contradicted this result. In the abstract, he wrote ""We
find striking differences between populations that have recombination and
populations that do not. If variation is produced by mutation alone, then the
entire population gains up to roughly 1 bit per generation. If variation is
created by recombination, the population can gain of the order of sqrt(G) bits
per generation."" Mackay proposed that there were outstanding evolutionary
benefits to sexual reproduction, and that my result was too low by a very large
factor. He later repeated this result in a textbook he wrote in 2003. The
purpose of this note is to show that the key assumption of Mackays model, that
""fitness is a strictly additive trait"" is so unrealistic as to render his
results irrelevant to any actual life form. In consequence, the speed limit I

Detailed modelling of photospheric absorption lines requires knowing the
underlying spectral continuum level. Here we describe the development of a
fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method, based
on fitting cubic splines to carefully selected data regions. Example fits to
the Hubble Space Telescope spectrum of the white dwarf G191-B2B are given. We
carry out measurements of the fine structure constant using two continuum
models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small
systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines
which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect
must therefore be included in the overall error budget of future measurements.
Our results also suggest that continuum placement variations should be
investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements
in stars other than white dwarfs, quasar absorption line measurements of the
fine structure constant, and quasar measurements of cosmological redshift
drift.

projectives and injectives since $A$ is injective relative to the coherent

lattice-walled square honeycomb, origami and square honeycomb), as well as
three sets of AM process parameters, characterised by laser powers of 50, 125
and 200 W. The exposure time is adjusted to deliver the same total heat input.
The 125 W case leads to material with the highest strength and ductility. The
cellular materials with this process variant match their nominal densities most
closely, and have the highest strength and energy absorption. Either reducing
(50 W) or increasing (200 W) the power leads to a significant increase in
porosity, reducing strength and energy absorption. However, we find that
changes due to process-induced porosity have a smaller influence than those
resulting from the choice of cellular architecture.

adapted by replacing the Riemann integral for real-valued functions by the
weighted metric integral for SVFs of bounded variation with compact graphs. For
such a set-valued function $F$, we obtain pointwise error estimates for
sequences of integral operators at points of continuity, leading to convergence
at such points to $F$. At points of discontinuity of $F$, we derive estimates,
which yield the convergence to a set, first described in our previous work on
the metric Fourier operator. Our analysis uses recently defined one-sided local
quasi-moduli at points of discontinuity and several notions of local Lipschitz
property at points of continuity.
  We also provide a global approach for error bounds. A multifunction $F$ is
represented by the set of all its metric selections, while its approximation
(its image under the operator) is represented by the set of images of these
metric selections under the operator. A bound on the Hausdorff distance between
these two sets of single-valued functions in $L^1$ provides our global
estimates.
  The theory is illustrated by presenting the examples of two concrete
operators: the Bernstein-Durrmeyer operator and the Kantorovich operator.

While conventional 3D object detectors use a set of unordered LiDAR points
acquired over a fixed time interval, recent studies have revealed that
substantial performance improvement can be achieved by exploiting the
spatio-temporal context present in a sequence of LiDAR point sets. In this
paper, we propose a novel 3D object detection architecture, which can encode
LiDAR point cloud sequences acquired by multiple successive scans. The encoding
process of the point cloud sequence is performed on two different time scales.
We first design a short-term motion-aware voxel encoding that captures the
short-term temporal changes of point clouds driven by the motion of objects in
each voxel. We also propose long-term motion-guided bird's eye view (BEV)
feature enhancement that adaptively aligns and aggregates the BEV feature maps
obtained by the short-term voxel encoding by utilizing the dynamic motion
context inferred from the sequence of the feature maps. The experiments
conducted on the public nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that the proposed 3D

texts from intentionally corrupted ones. Taking the former text as positive and
the latter as negative samples, the PLM can be trained effectively for
contextualized representation. However, the training of such a type of PLMs
highly relies on the quality of the automatically constructed samples. Existing
PLMs simply treat all corrupted texts as equal negative without any
examination, which actually lets the resulting model inevitably suffer from the
false negative issue where training is carried out on pseudo-negative data and
leads to less efficiency and less robustness in the resulting PLMs. In this
work, on the basis of defining the false negative issue in discriminative PLMs
that has been ignored for a long time, we design enhanced pre-training methods
to counteract false negative predictions and encourage pre-training language
models on true negatives by correcting the harmful gradient updates subject to
false negative predictions. Experimental results on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks
show that our counter-false-negative pre-training methods indeed bring about
better performance together with stronger robustness.

Filaments are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and they host star
formation. Detecting them in a reliable way is therefore key towards our
understanding of the star formation process.
  Aims. We explore whether supervised machine learning can identify filamentary
structures on the whole Galactic plane.
  Methods. We used two versions of UNet-based networks for image
segmentation.We used H2 column density images of the Galactic plane obtained
with Herschel Hi-GAL data as input data. We trained the UNet-based networks
with skeletons (spine plus branches) of filaments that were extracted from
these images, together with background and missing data masks that we produced.
We tested eight training scenarios to determine the best scenario for our
astrophysical purpose of classifying pixels as filaments.
  Results. The training of the UNets allows us to create a new image of the
Galactic plane by segmentation in which pixels belonging to filamentary
structures are identified. With this new method, we classify more pixels (more
by a factor of 2 to 7, depending on the classification threshold used) as
belonging to filaments than the spine plus branches structures we used as
input. New structures are revealed, which are mainly low-contrast filaments
that were not detected before.We use standard metrics to evaluate the
performances of the different training scenarios. This allows us to demonstrate
the robustness of the method and to determine an optimal threshold value that
maximizes the recovery of the input labelled pixel classification.
  Conclusions. This proof-of-concept study shows that supervised machine
learning can reveal filamentary structures that are present throughout the
Galactic plane. The detection of these structures, including low-density and
low-contrast structures that have never been seen before, offers important
perspectives for the study of these filaments.

However, only by tackling the performance gap above can we fully exploit the

Prototypical (FoPro) representation learning method, which only needs a few
labeled examples from reality and can significantly improve the performance in
the real-world domain. Specifically, we initialize each class center with
few-shot real-world data as the ``realistic"" prototype. Then, the intra-class
distance between web instances and ``realistic"" prototypes is narrowed by
contrastive learning. Finally, we measure image-prototype distance with a
learnable metric. Prototypes are polished by adjacent high-quality web images
and involved in removing distant out-of-distribution samples. In experiments,
FoPro is trained on web datasets with a few real-world examples guided and
evaluated on real-world datasets. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art

Compared with existing WSL methods under the same few-shot settings, FoPro

However, there are several competing notions of algorithmic fairness that have
been shown to be mutually incompatible under realistic factual assumptions.
This concerns, for example, the widely used fairness measures of 'calibration

present a novel algorithm (FAir Interpolation Method: FAIM) for continuously

many-body Lindbladian under antiunitary symmetries and unitary involutions. We
find that Hermiticity preservation reduces the number of symmetry classes,
while trace preservation and complete positivity do not, and that the set of
admissible classes depends on the presence of additional unitary symmetries: in
their absence or in symmetry sectors containing steady states, many-body
Lindbladians belong to one of ten non-Hermitian symmetry classes; if however,
there are additional symmetries and we consider non-steady-state sectors, they
belong to a different set of 19 classes. In both cases, it does not include
classes with Kramer's degeneracy. Remarkably, our classification admits a
straightforward generalization to the case of non-Markovian, and even
non-trace-preserving, open quantum dynamics. While the abstract classification
is completely general, we then apply it to general (long-range, interacting,
spatially inhomogeneous) spin-$1/2$ chains. We explicitly build examples in all
ten classes of Lindbladians in steady-state sectors, describing standard
physical processes such as dephasing, spin injection and absorption, and
incoherent hopping, thus illustrating the relevance of our classification for
practical physics applications. Finally, we show that the examples in each
class display unique random-matrix correlations. To fully resolve all
symmetries, we employ the combined analysis of bulk complex spacing ratios and
the overlap of eigenvector pairs related by symmetry operations. We further
find that statistics of levels constrained onto the real and imaginary axes or
close to the origin are not universal due to spontaneous breaking of
Lindbladian PT symmetry.

puzzling because axon conduction velocity is limited to a few ten meters per

one would expect a destabilizing effect on sensorimotor control. Hence, an
alternative explanation describes a hierarchical structure of low-level
adaptive mechanics and high-level sensorimotor control to help mitigate the
effects of transmission delays. Motivated by the concept of an adaptive
mechanism triggering an immediate response, we developed a tunable physical
damper system. Our mechanism combines a tendon with adjustable slackness
connected to a physical damper. The slack damper allows adjustment of damping
force, onset timing, effective stroke, and energy dissipation. We characterize
the slack damper mechanism mounted to a legged robot controlled in open-loop
mode. The robot hops vertically and planar over varying terrains and
perturbations. During forward hopping, slack-based damping improves faster
perturbation recovery (up to 170%) at higher energetic cost (27%). The tunable
slack mechanism auto-engages the damper during perturbations, leading to a
perturbation-trigger damping, improving robustness at minimum energetic cost.
With the results from the slack damper mechanism, we propose a new functional
interpretation of animals' redundant muscle tendons as tunable dampers.

label problem, which is a task of making deep learning robust to the
incorrectly labeled data, has become an important task. In this paper, we
propose a method of learning noisy label data using the label noise selection
with test-time augmentation (TTA) cross-entropy and classifier learning with
the NoiseMix method. In the label noise selection, we propose TTA cross-entropy
by measuring the cross-entropy to predict the test-time augmented training
data. In the classifier learning, we propose the NoiseMix method based on MixUp
and BalancedMix methods by mixing the samples from the noisy and the clean
label data. In experiments on the ISIC-18 public skin lesion diagnosis dataset,
the proposed TTA cross-entropy outperformed the conventional cross-entropy and
the TTA uncertainty in detecting label noise data in the label noise selection
process. Moreover, the proposed NoiseMix not only outperformed the
state-of-the-art methods in the classification performance but also showed the
most robustness to the label noise in the classifier learning.

sharing on the Internet. However, posts on social networks are often aggressive
and toxic, especially when the topic is controversial or politically charged.
Radicalization, extreme speech, and in particular online misogyny against women
in the public eye have become alarmingly negative features of online
discussions. The present study proposes a methodological approach to contribute
to ongoing discussions about the multiple ways in which women, their
experiences, and their choices are attacked in polarized social media
responses. Based on a review of theories on and detection methods for misogyny,
we present a classification scheme that incorporates eleven different explicit
as well as implicit layers of online misogyny. We also apply our classes to a
case study related to online aggression against Amber Heard in the context of
her allegations of domestic violence against Johnny Depp. We finally evaluate
the reliability of Google's Perspective API -- a standard for detecting toxic
language -- for determining gender discrimination as toxicity. We show that a
large part of online misogyny, especially when verbalized without expletive
terms but instead more implicitly is not captured automatically.

finding the most economical and feasible generation schedules and dispatch

promise for reducing a number of inactive or redundant constraints in the UC
problem, so that the solution process of large scale UC problem can be
accelerated by considering the reduced optimization problem. Standard
constraint screening approach relies on optimizing over load and generations to
find binding line flow constraints, yet the screening is conservative with a
large percentage of constraints still reserved for the UC problem. In this
paper, we propose a novel machine learning (ML) model to predict the most
economical costs given load inputs. Such ML model bridges the cost perspectives
of UC decisions to the optimization-based constraint screening model, and can
screen out higher proportion of operational constraints. We verify the proposed

Recent research works have revealed that droplets sit, slide and spread
anisotropically on uniaxially stretched soft substrates, showing an enhanced
wettability and contact line mobility along the stretching direction. This
phenomenon arises from the anisotropic deformation of the substrate below the
contact line. Here, we investigate how the stretching of soft substrates
affects droplets drying. We observe that water droplet evaporates with an
elongated non-circular contact line on the stretched substrates and switches
the elongation direction during evaporation. The contact line velocity and its
temporal evolution depend on the orientation of the contact line relative to
the stretching direction. On the substrate stretched by 250%, the contact line
recedes about 20% of the droplet lifetime earlier along the stretching
direction and faster than its perpendicular direction. When nanoparticles are
added into the liquid, the circular deposition pattern, i.e., the so-called
coffee-ring, becomes elongated along the direction perpendicular to the
stretching direction. Particularly, such non-circular deposition pattern
exhibits periodic height gradients along its rim. The finer structure of the
pattern can be controlled by applying different stretching ratios to the soft
substrate and thus are correlated to the anisotropic surface stresses near the
contact line.

the language is restricted to second-order objects or if one allows third-order

numerous equivalences involving the second-order Big Five systems on one hand,

edge learning (FEEL) is a new paradigm featuring distributed learning to carry
the capacities of low-latency and privacy-preserving. To further improve the
efficiency of wireless data aggregation and model learning, over-the-air
computation (AirComp) is emerging as a promising solution by using the
superposition characteristics of wireless channels. However, the fading and
noise of wireless channels can cause aggregate distortions in AirComp enabled
federated learning. In addition, the quality of collected data and energy
consumption of edge devices may also impact the accuracy and efficiency of
model aggregation as well as convergence. To solve these problems, this work
proposes a dynamic device scheduling mechanism, which can select qualified edge
devices to transmit their local models with a proper power control policy so as
to participate the model training at the server in federated learning via
AirComp. In this mechanism, the data importance is measured by the gradient of
local model parameter, channel condition and energy consumption of the device
jointly. In particular, to fully use distributed datasets and accelerate the
convergence rate of federated learning, the local updates of unselected devices
are also retained and accumulated for future potential transmission, instead of
being discarded directly. Furthermore, the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty
optimization problem is formulated for searching the optimal device selection
strategy. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheduling mechanism
can achieve higher test accuracy and faster convergence rate, and is robust
against different channel conditions.

spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) are maximized in both
narrowband and wideband THz systems by jointly optimizing the hybrid
beamforming at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STARS.
1) For narrowband systems, independent phase-shift STARSs are investigated
first. The resulting complex joint optimization problem is decoupled into a
series of subproblems using penalty dual decomposition. Low-complexity
element-wise algorithms are proposed to optimize the analog beamforming at the
BS and the passive beamforming at the STARS. The proposed algorithm is then
extended to the case of coupled phase-shift STARS. 2) For wideband systems, the
spatial wideband effect at the BS and STARS leads to significant performance
degradation due to the beam split issue. To address this, true time delayers
(TTDs) are introduced into the conventional hybrid beamforming structure for
facilitating wideband beamforming. An iterative algorithm based on the
quasi-Newton method is proposed to design the coefficients of the TTDs.
Finally, our numerical results confirm the superiority of the STARS over the
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is also revealed that
i) there is only a slight performance loss in terms of SE and EE caused by
coupled phase shifts of the STARS in both narrowband and wideband systems, and
ii) the conventional hybrid beamforming achieves comparable SE performance and
much higher EE performance compared with the full-digital beamforming in
narrowband systems but not in wideband systems, where the TTD-based hybrid
beamforming is required for mitigating wideband beam split.

crucial causes of many crowd disasters. In the recent decade, video anomaly
detection (VAD) techniques have achieved remarkable success in detecting
individual-level abnormal behaviors (e.g., sudden running, fighting and
stealing), but research on VAD for CABs is rather limited. Unlike
individual-level anomaly, CABs usually do not exhibit salient difference from
the normal behaviors when observed locally, and the scale of CABs could vary
from one scenario to another. In this paper, we present a systematic study to
tackle the important problem of VAD for CABs with a novel crowd motion learning
framework, multi-scale motion consistency network (MSMC-Net). MSMC-Net first
captures the spatial and temporal crowd motion consistency information in a
graph representation. Then, it simultaneously trains multiple feature graphs
constructed at different scales to capture rich crowd patterns. An attention
network is used to adaptively fuse the multi-scale features for better CAB
detection. For the empirical study, we consider three large-scale crowd event
datasets, UMN, Hajj and Love Parade. Experimental results show that MSMC-Net

their further characterisation. Their key properties, namely, their impulsive
nature and ubiquitous presence on the quiet Sun are observed in these data as
well. Interestingly, we also find some of the observed properties to differ
significantly from the earlier work. With this demonstration of routine

to easily include or exclude functionality in a software product. The research
contributions to these two techniques have most often been focused on either
one of them separately. However, focusing on the similarities of these two
techniques may enable a more fruitful combined family of research on software
configuration, a term we use to encompass both techniques. Also, a common
terminology may have enabled meta-analysis, a more practical application of the
research on the two techniques, and prevented duplication of research effort.
The goal of this research study is to aid researchers in conducting a family of
research on software configuration by extending an existing model of software
configuration that provides terminology for research studies. To achieve our
goal, we started with Seigmund et al. Model of Software Configuration (MSC)
which was developed based on interviews and publications on configuration
options. We explicitly extend the MSC to include feature toggles and to add
qualitative analysis of feature toggle-related resources. From our analysis, we
proposed MSCv2 as an extended version of MSC and evaluated it through its
application on five academic publications and the Chrome system. Our results
indicate that multiple researchers studying the same system may provide
different definitions of software configuration in their publications. Also,
similar research questions may be answered on feature toggles and configuration
options repeatedly because of a lack of a clear definition of software
configuration. These observations indicate that having a model for defining
software configuration may enable more clear and generalized research on the
software configuration family of research. Practitioners benefit MSCv2 in their
systems to better knowledge transfer to other practitioners and researchers.

activity changes the structure of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and how
this affects the HSS/CIR storms. Space age started with a record number of
storms in 1957-1960, with roughly one storm per week. Solar polar fields
attained their maximum in cycle 22, which led to an exceptionally thin HCS, and
a space age record of large HSS/CIR storms in 1990s. In the minimum of cycle
23, for the only time in space age, CME storm occurrence reduced below that
predicted by sunspots. Weak sunspot activity since cycle 23 has weakened solar
polar fields and widened the HCS, which has decreased the occurrence of large
and moderate HSS/CIR storms. Because of a wide HCS, the Earth has spent 50% of
its time in slow solar wind since cycle 23. The wide HCS has also made large

formation remain crucial open questions. DG Tau B is a Class I protostar
associated with a rotating conical CO outflow and a structured disk. Hence it
is an ideal target to study these questions. We aim to characterize the
morphology and kinematics of the DG Tau B outflow in order to elucidate its
origin and potential impact on the disk. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA) 12CO(2-1) observations of DG Tau B at 20 au angular
resolution. We characterize three different types of substructures in this
outflow (arches, fingers, and cusps) with apparent acceleration. Wind-driven
shell models with a Hubble law fail to explain these substructures. In
contrast, both the morphology and kinematics of the conical flow can be
explained by a steady conical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind with
foot-point radii r0= 0.7-3.4 au, a small magnetic level arm parameter lambda <
1.6), and quasi periodic brightness enhancements. These might be caused by the
impact of jet bow shocks, source orbital motion caused by a 25 MJ companion at
50 au, or disk density perturbations accreting through the wind launching
region. The large CO wind mass flux (four times the accretion rate onto the
central star) can also be explained if the MHD disk wind removes most of the
angular momentum required for steady disk accretion. Our results provide the
strongest evidence so far for the presence of massive MHD disk winds in Class I
sources with residual infall, and they suggest that the initial stages of
planet formation take place in a highly dynamic environment.

by digitising quantum annealing. Based on this inspiration, we develop
techniques to use the additional flexibility of a universal gate-model quantum
computer to mitigate fluctuation effects which are known to distort the search
space within quantum annealing and lead to false minima. We find that even just
the added ability to take Pauli X measurements allows us to modify the mixer
angles to counteract these effects by scaling mixer terms in a way proportional
to the diagonal elements of the Fubini-Study metric. We find that mitigating
these effects can lead to higher success probabilities in cases where the
energy landscape is distorted and that we can use the same Pauli X measurements
to target which variables are likely to be susceptible to strong fluctuations.
The effects of the methods we introduce are relevant even at relatively low
depth of $p=10-20$, suggesting that the techniques we are developing are likely
to be relevant in the near term. Furthermore, since these methods rely on
controlling a degree of freedom which is not typically modified in QAOA, our
methods will be compatible with a wide range of other QAOA innovations. We
further verify that these fluctuation effects can be observed on an IonQ
Harmony QPU.

  Sparse Control Variates",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Safety performance evaluation is critical for developing and deploying
connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). One prevailing way is to design
testing scenarios using prior knowledge of CAVs, test CAVs in these scenarios,
and then evaluate their safety performances. However, significant differences
between CAVs and prior knowledge could severely reduce the evaluation
efficiency. Towards addressing this issue, most existing studies focus on the
adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process, but so far
they cannot be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper, we focus
on the adaptive safety performance evaluation by leveraging the testing
results, after the CAV testing process. It can significantly improve the
evaluation efficiency and be applied to high-dimensional scenarios.
Specifically, instead of directly evaluating the unknown quantity (e.g., crash
rates) of CAV safety performances, we evaluate the differences between the
unknown quantity and known quantity (i.e., control variates). By leveraging the
testing results, the control variates could be well designed and optimized such
that the differences are close to zero, so the evaluation variance could be
dramatically reduced for different CAVs. To handle the high-dimensional
scenarios, we propose the sparse control variates method, where the control
variates are designed only for the sparse and critical variables of scenarios.
According to the number of critical variables in each scenario, the control
variates are stratified into strata and optimized within each stratum using
multiple linear regression techniques. We justify the proposed method's
effectiveness by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical study of
high-dimensional overtaking scenarios.

quantum effects into quantum chemistry calculations. In multicomponent methods,
the electronic molecular orbitals are described using the linear combination of
atomic orbitals approximation. This requires the selection of a one-particle
electronic basis set which, in practice, is commonly a correlation-consistent
basis set. In multicomponent method studies, it has been demonstrated that
large electronic basis sets are required for quantum hydrogen nuclei to
accurately describe electron-nuclear correlation. However, as we show in this
study, much of the need for large electronic basis sets is due to the
correlation-consistent electronic basis sets not being optimized to describe
nuclear properties and electron-nuclear correlation. Herein, we introduce a
series of correlation-consistent electronic basis sets for hydrogen atoms
called cc-pVnZ-mc with additional basis functions optimized to reproduce
multicomponent density functional theory protonic densities. These new
electronic basis sets are shown to yield better protonic densities with fewer
electronic basis functions than the standard correlation-consistent basis sets
and reproduce other protonic properties such as proton affinities and protonic
excitation energies, even though they were not optimized for these purposes.
The cc-pVnZ-mc basis sets should enable multicomponent many-body calculations
on larger systems due to the improved computational efficiency they provide for
a given level of accuracy.

proposed, there is considerable interest in universal approaches (henceforth
called Universal Constructions or UCs) for building concurrent data structures.
These approaches (semi-)automatically convert a sequential data structure into
a concurrent one. The simplest approach uses locks that protect a sequential
data structure and allow only one process to access it at a time. The resulting
data structures use locks, and hence are blocking. Most work on UCs instead
focuses on obtaining non-blocking progress guarantees such as
obstruction-freedom, lock-freedom, or wait-freedom. Many non-blocking UCs have
appeared. Key examples include the seminal wait-free UC by Herlihy, a
NUMA-aware UC by Yi et al., and an efficient UC for large objects by Fatourou

  We borrow ideas from persistent data structures and multi-version concurrency
control (MVCC), most notably path copying, and use them to implement concurrent
versions of sequential persistent data structures. Despite our expectation that
our data structures would not scale under write-heavy workloads, they scale in
practice. We confirm this scaling analytically in our model with private

features, which account for the majority of features in many CTR tasks, are
less considered in standard supervised learning settings, leading to
sub-optimal feature representations. In this paper, we introduce
self-supervised learning to produce high-quality feature representations
directly and propose a model-agnostic Contrastive Learning for CTR (CL4CTR)
framework consisting of three self-supervised learning signals to regularize
the feature representation learning: contrastive loss, feature alignment, and
field uniformity. The contrastive module first constructs positive feature
pairs by data augmentation and then minimizes the distance between the
representations of each positive feature pair by the contrastive loss. The
feature alignment constraint forces the representations of features from the
same field to be close, and the field uniformity constraint forces the
representations of features from different fields to be distant. Extensive
experiments verify that CL4CTR achieves the best performance on four datasets
and has excellent effectiveness and compatibility with various representative
baselines.

whether policies are obtained by learning algorithms, planning algorithms, or
human insight, we want to know the limits of feasibility for given robot
hardware and tasks. Toward the quest to find the best policies, we establish in
a general setting that minimal information transition systems (ITSs) exist up
to reasonable equivalence assumptions, and are unique under some general
conditions. We then apply the theory to generate new insights into several
problems, including optimal sensor fusion/filtering, solving basic planning
tasks, and finding minimal representations for feasible policies.

statistical analysis of redshift information of the potential host galaxies,
and such GW data are commonly referred to as dark sirens. The third-generation

high-quality galaxy catalogs from future sky survey projects. The China Space

of GAD is to capture anomalous nodes from graph datasets, which evidently
deviate from the majority of nodes. Recent methods have paid attention to
various scales of contrastive strategies for GAD, i.e., node-subgraph and
node-node contrasts. However, they neglect the subgraph-subgraph comparison
information which the normal and abnormal subgraph pairs behave differently in
terms of embeddings and structures in GAD, resulting in sub-optimal task

multi-view multi-scale contrastive learning framework with subgraph-subgraph
contrast for the first practice. To be specific, we regard the original input
graph as the first view and generate the second view by graph augmentation with
edge modifications. With the guidance of maximizing the similarity of the
subgraph pairs, the proposed subgraph-subgraph contrast contributes to more
robust subgraph embeddings despite of the structure variation. Moreover, the
introduced subgraph-subgraph contrast cooperates well with the widely-adopted
node-subgraph and node-node contrastive counterparts for mutual GAD performance
promotions. Besides, we also conduct sufficient experiments to investigate the
impact of different graph augmentation approaches on detection performance. The
comprehensive experimental results well demonstrate the superiority of our

study theoretically the consequences of membrane responsiveness and feedback on
the steady-state force--flux relations and membrane permeability using a
nonlinear-feedback solution-diffusion model of transport through a slab-like
membrane. Therein, the solute concentration inside the membrane depends on the
bulk concentration, $c_0$, the driving force, $f$, and the polymer volume
fraction, $\phi$. In our model, solute accumulation in the membrane causes a
sigmoidal volume phase transition of the polymer, changing its permeability,
which, in return, affects the membrane's solute uptake. This feedback leads to
nonlinear force--flux relations, $j(f)$, which we quantify in terms of the
system's differential permeability, $\mathcal{P}_\text{sys}^{\Delta}\propto
{\mathrm{d}j}/{\mathrm{d}f}$. We find that the membrane feedback can increase
or decrease the solute flux by orders of magnitude, triggered by a small change
in the driving force, and largely tunable by attractive versus repulsive
solute--membrane interactions. Moreover, controlling the input, $c_0$ and $f$,
can lead to steady-state bistability of $\phi$ and hysteresis in the
force--flux relations. This work advocates that the fine-tuning of the
membrane's chemo-responsiveness will enhance the nonlinear transport control
features, providing great potential for future (self-)regulating membrane

efficient alternative to tedious and costly wet-lab experiments for predicting
novel DTIs from numerous candidates. Recently, with the availability of
abundant heterogeneous biological information from diverse data sources,
computational methods have been able to leverage multiple drug and target
similarities to boost the performance of DTI prediction. Similarity integration
is an effective and flexible strategy to extract crucial information across
complementary similarity views, providing a compressed input for any

methods filter and fuse similarities from a global perspective, neglecting the
utility of similarity views for each drug and target. In this study, we propose

processing and is widely used in quantum communication, quantum computation and
quantum metrology. Early research on quantum entanglement mainly focus on qubit
states, but in recent years, more and more research has begun to focus on
high-dimensional entangled states. Compared with qubit entangled states,
higher-dimensional entangled states have a larger information capacity and the
potential to realize more complex quantum applications. In this Letter, we have
experimentally prepared a special high-dimensional entangled state, the
so-called three-photon asymmetric maximally entangled state, which consists of
two two-dimensional photons and one four-dimensional photon. Using this
asymmetric maximally entangled state as a resource, we have also implemented a
proof-of-principle quantum teleportation experiment, realizing the transfer of
quantum information from two qubits to a single ququart. The fidelities of the
quantum teleportation range from 0.79 to 0.86, which are well above both the
optimal single-copy ququart state-estimation limit of 2/5 and maximal
qutrit-ququart overlap of 3/4, thus confirming a genuine and nonclassical
four-dimensional teleportation. The asymmetric entangled state realized here
has the potential to be used as a quantum interface in future quantum networks,
allowing quantum information transfer between quantum objects of different
dimensions via the quantum teleportation protocol demonstrated in this work.

correlation-based methods, effective connectivity can provide the direction of
information flow, which may provide additional information for the diagnosis of
brain diseases. However, existing methods either ignore the fact that there is
a temporal-lag in the information transmission across brain regions, or simply
set the temporal-lag value between all brain regions to a fixed value. To
overcome these issues, we design an effective temporal-lag neural network

shown promising results in prediction tasks in healthcare. However, patient

(DKL) framework may be robust to such changes as it combines neural models with

hypothesise, will result in better calibration on prospective data.
  This paper investigates DKL's behaviour when facing a temporal shift, which
was naturally introduced when an information system that feeds a cohort

the Universe is populated by large inhomogeneities on very small scales.
Eventually, these fluctuations will collapse gravitationally to form dense
axion miniclusters that trap up to $\sim$75% of the dark matter within
asteroid-mass clumps. Axion miniclusters are physically tiny however, so
haloscope experiments searching for axions directly on Earth are much more
likely to be probing ``minivoids'' -- the space in between miniclusters. This
scenario seems like it ought to spell doom for haloscopes, but while these
minivoids might be underdense, they are not totally devoid of axions. Using
Schr\""odinger-Poisson and N-body simulations to evolve from realistic initial
field configurations, we quantify the extent to which the local ambient dark
matter density is suppressed in the post-inflationary scenario. We find that a
typical experimental measurement will sample an axion density that is only
around 10% of the expected galactic dark matter density. Our results also have
implications for experimental campaigns lasting longer than a few years, as

clouds. Specifically, to take advantage of the complementary information from
2D images, we use a single-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a
fusion module to fuse the 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point
cloud. To guide the shape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted
points of the object to the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its
silhouette maps to constrain the position of the projected points. To reduce
the outliers of the predicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to
move the points projected to the background into the foreground by the
single-view silhouette image. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the
first point cloud completion method that does not require any 3D supervision.
The experimental results of our method are superior to those of the
state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin. Moreover, compared to
some supervised methods, our method achieves similar performance. We will make
the source code publicly available at https://github.com/ltwu6/cross-pcc.

the macula, a key area of the retina for visual acuity. Nowadays, it is the
most frequent cause of blindness in developed countries. Although some
promising treatments have been developed, their effectiveness is low in
advanced stages. This emphasizes the importance of large-scale screening
programs. Nevertheless, implementing such programs for AMD is usually
unfeasible, since the population at risk is large and the diagnosis is
challenging. All this motivates the development of automatic methods. In this
sense, several works have achieved positive results for AMD diagnosis using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, none incorporates explainability
mechanisms, which limits their use in clinical practice. In that regard, we
propose an explainable deep learning approach for the diagnosis of AMD via the
joint identification of its associated retinal lesions. In our proposal, a CNN
is trained end-to-end for the joint task using image-level labels. The provided
lesion information is of clinical interest, as it allows to assess the
developmental stage of AMD. Additionally, the approach allows to explain the
diagnosis from the identified lesions. This is possible thanks to the use of a
CNN with a custom setting that links the lesions and the diagnosis.
Furthermore, the proposed setting also allows to obtain coarse lesion
segmentation maps in a weakly-supervised way, further improving the
explainability. The training data for the approach can be obtained without much
extra work by clinicians. The experiments conducted demonstrate that our
approach can identify AMD and its associated lesions satisfactorily, while
providing adequate coarse segmentation maps for most common lesions.

results predicted by two representative networks with and without the

multiple expectations. Estimating all of them accurately is crucial and can
have a major impact on the analysis to perform, and standard existing Monte
Carlo methods can be costly to do so. We propose here a new procedure based on
importance sampling and control variates for estimating more efficiently
multiple expectations with the same sample. We first show that there exists a
family of optimal estimators combining both importance sampling and control
variates, which however cannot be used in practice because they require the
knowledge of the values of the expectations to estimate. Motivated by the form
of these optimal estimators and some interesting properties, we therefore
propose an adaptive algorithm. The general idea is to adaptively update the
parameters of the estimators for approaching the optimal ones. We suggest then
a quantitative stopping criterion that exploits the trade-off between
approaching these optimal parameters and having a sufficient budget left. This
left budget is then used to draw a new independent sample from the final
sampling distribution, allowing to get unbiased estimators of the expectations.
We show how to apply our procedure to sensitivity analysis, by estimating
Sobol' indices and quantifying the impact of the input distributions. Finally,
realistic test cases show the practical interest of the proposed algorithm, and
its significant improvement over estimating the expectations separately.

detailed microstate count of the $dS_3$ cosmic horizon, reproducing the refined
Gibbons-Hawking entropy computed by Anninos et al along with the correct radial
bulk geometry. On the gravity side, the deformation brings in the boundary to
just outside a black hole horizon, where it is indistinguishable from the dS
cosmic horizon, enabling a continuous passage to a bounded patch of dS. In
string/M theory, the relationship between AdS/CFT and dS involves uplifts that
change the internal topology, e.g. replacing an internal sphere $\mathbb{S}$

and conformal factors). We connect these two approaches, noting that the
differences in the extra dimensions between AdS black hole and dS solutions are
washed out by internal averaging in the presence of a timelike boundary
skirting the horizon. This helps to motivate a detailed investigation into the

these limited resources, an extra controller is designed to enhance the safety
of the new closed loop. The safety of the system will be characterized by the
notion of safe sets. Lyapunov based analysis will be used to derive sufficient
conditions that ensure the states always stay in the safe set. The conditions

  Multi-Robot Automatic Warehouses: Problem Formulation and Algorithm",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Path planning in the multi-robot system refers to calculating a set of
actions for each robot, which will move each robot to its goal without
conflicting with other robots. Lately, the research topic has received
significant attention for its extensive applications, such as airport ground,
drone swarms, and automatic warehouses. Despite these available research
results, most of the existing investigations are concerned with the cases of
robots with a fixed movement speed without considering uncertainty. Therefore,
in this work, we study the problem of path-planning in the multi-robot
automatic warehouse context, which considers the time-varying and uncertain
robots' movement speed. Specifically, the path-planning module searches a path
with as few conflicts as possible for a single agent by calculating traffic
cost based on customarily distributed conflict probability and combining it
with the classic A* algorithm. However, this probability-based method cannot
eliminate all conflicts, and speed's uncertainty will constantly cause new
conflicts. As a supplement, we propose the other two modules. The conflict
detection and re-planning module chooses objects requiring re-planning paths
from the agents involved in different types of conflicts periodically by our
designed rules. Also, at each step, the scheduling module fills up the agent's
preserved queue and decides who has a higher priority when the same element is
assigned to two agents simultaneously. Finally, we compare the proposed
algorithm with other algorithms from academia and industry, and the results
show that the proposed method is validated as the best performance.

over billions of text documents have been shown to also significantly predict
brain recordings of people comprehending language. Understanding the reasons
behind the observed similarities between language in machines and language in
the brain can lead to more insight into both systems. Recent works suggest that
the prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to the
alignment between the two. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of
the next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient,
and whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that is similarly
important. In this work, we take a first step towards a better understanding
via two simple perturbations in a popular pretrained language model. The first
perturbation is to improve the model's ability to predict the next word in the
specific naturalistic stimulus text that the brain recordings correspond to. We
show that this indeed improves the alignment with the brain recordings.
However, this improved alignment may also be due to any improved word-level or
multi-word level semantics for the specific world that is described by the
stimulus narrative. We aim to disentangle the contribution of next word
prediction and semantic knowledge via our second perturbation: scrambling the
word order at inference time, which reduces the ability to predict the next
word, but maintains any newly learned word-level semantics. By comparing the
alignment with brain recordings of these differently perturbed models, we show
that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than
improvements in next word prediction and word-level semantics.

these functions can be used to enforce invariance of a set under the dynamics

paper presents a method of verifying any finite number of candidate control

candidate control barrier functions, but this does not always scale well.
Therefore, we next apply a method of inner-approximating the set of sums of

performed with the MAMPOSSt code on the observed kinematics of a velocity
dispersion based stack (sigmav) of 54 nearby regular clusters of galaxies from
the WINGS dataset. In the definition of PPSD, the density is either in total
mass rho (Q_rho) or in galaxy number density nu (Q_nu) of three morphological
classes of galaxies (ellipticals, lenticulars, and spirals), while the velocity
dispersion (obtained by inversion of the Jeans equation) is either the total
(Q_rho and Q_nu) or its radial component (Q_r,rho and Q_r,nu). We find that the
PPSD profiles are power-law relations for nearly all MCMC parameters. The
logarithmic slopes of our observed Q_rho(r) and Q_r,rho(r) for ellipticals and
spirals are in excellent agreement with the predictions for particles in
simulations, but slightly shallower for S0s. For Q_nu(r) and Q_r,nu(r), only
the ellipticals have a PPSD slope matching that of particles in simulations,

for cluster stacks based on richness or gas temperature, the fraction of
power-law PPSDs is lower (esp. Q_nu) and the Q_rho slopes are shallower, except
for S0s. The observed PPSD profiles, defined using rho rather than nu, appear
to be a fundamental property of galaxy clusters. They would be imprinted during
an early phase of violent relaxation for dark matter and ellipticals, and later
for spirals as they move towards dynamical equilibrium in the cluster
gravitational potential, while S0s are either intermediate (richness and

taking into account the image semantic properties, and finally converges to a
self-calibrated segmentation result reflecting the inter-observer agreement.
Specifically, we propose Converging Prism (ConP) and Diverging Prism (DivP) to
process the two tasks iteratively. ConP learns calibrated segmentation based on
the multi-rater confidence maps estimated by DivP. DivP generates multi-rater
confidence maps based on the segmentation masks estimated by ConP. The
experimental results show that by recurrently running ConP and DivP, the two
tasks can achieve mutual improvement. The final converged segmentation result
of MrPrism outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) strategies on a wide range of

easy-to-learn samples (i.e., bias-aligned samples) and highlighting
difficult-to-learn samples (i.e., bias-conflicting samples). However, these
techniques may fail owing to noisy labels, because the trained model recognizes
noisy labels as difficult-to-learn and thus highlights them. In this study, we
find that earlier approaches that used the provided labels to quantify
difficulty could be affected by the small proportion of noisy labels.
Furthermore, we find that running denoising algorithms before debiasing is
ineffective because denoising algorithms reduce the impact of
difficult-to-learn samples, including valuable bias-conflicting samples.
Therefore, we propose an approach called denoising after entropy-based
debiasing, i.e., DENEB, which has three main stages. (1) The prejudice model is
trained by emphasizing (bias-aligned, clean) samples, which are selected using
a Gaussian Mixture Model. (2) Using the per-sample entropy from the output of
the prejudice model, the sampling probability of each sample that is
proportional to the entropy is computed. (3) The final model is trained using
existing denoising algorithms with the mini-batches constructed by following
the computed sampling probability. Compared to existing debiasing and denoising
algorithms, our method achieves better debiasing performance on multiple
benchmarks.

well as nonuniversal couplings to leptons. For new physics solutions which
provide a good fit to all $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ data, we intend to identify
observables with large deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions as
well as to discriminate between various new physics solutions. For this we
consider the $B \to K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$ branching fraction, the $K^*$
longitudinal fraction $f_L$, the tau forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ and
the optimized observables in the $P_i^{(')}$ basis. Further, we construct the
$\tau - \mu$ lepton-flavor differences ($Q^{\tau\mu}$) between these tau
observables and their muonic counterparts in $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay.
Moreover, we also consider lepton-flavor ratios ($R^{\tau\mu}$) of all of these
observables. We find that the current data allows for deviations ranging from
25% up to an order of magnitude from the SM value in a number of observables.
For e.g., the magnitudes of $Q^{\tau \mu}_{P_3}$ and $Q^{\tau \mu}_{P'_8}$
observables can be enhanced up to an order of magnitude, a twofold enhancement
in $Q^{\tau\mu}_{A_{FB}}$ is possible along with $\sim$50% enhancement in

branching ratio of $B \to K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$ can be suppressed up to 25%. A

approach that aims to identify new therapeutic targets or diseases
(indications) of existing drugs/compounds. It is especially critical for
emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter
research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches.
However, the underlying mechanisms of action (MOAs) between repurposed drugs
and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still a main
obstacle for computational drug repurposing methods to be widely adopted in
clinical settings.
  Results: In this work, we propose KGML-xDTD: a Knowledge Graph-based Machine
Learning framework for explainably predicting Drugs Treating Diseases. It is a
two-module framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between
drugs/compounds and diseases but also biologically explains them via knowledge
graph (KG) path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs). We leverage
knowledge-and-publication based information to extract biologically meaningful
""demonstration paths"" as the intermediate guidance in the Graph-based
Reinforcement Learning (GRL) path-finding process. Comprehensive experiments
and case study analyses show that the proposed framework can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of drug repurposing and
recapitulation of human-curated drug MOA paths.
  Conclusions: KGML-xDTD is the first model framework that can offer KG-path
explanations for drug repurposing predictions by leveraging the combination of
prediction outcomes and existing biological knowledge and publications. We
believe it can effectively reduce ""black-box"" concerns and increase prediction
confidence for drug repurposing based on predicted path-based explanations, and
further accelerate the process of drug discovery for emerging diseases.

several neurons fire at once to activate a single grid. We want to capture this
firing structure and use it to decode grid cell data. Understanding,
representing, and decoding these neural structures require models that
encompass higher order connectivity than traditional graph-based models may

simplicial complex discovery with the power of deep learning via a new

only vertices and edges but also higher-dimensional objects, naturally
generalize graphs and capture more than just pairwise relationships.

activity beyond spike counts, which removes the need for similarity
measurements. The effectiveness and versatility of the SCRNN is demonstrated on

possible to acquire multi-energy data by spectral CT. Being different from
conventional CT, the X-ray energy spectrum of spectral CT is cutting into
several narrow bins which leads to the result that only a part of photon can be
collected in each individual energy channel, which cause the image qualities to
be severely degraded by noise and artifacts. To address this problem, we
propose a spectral CT reconstruction algorithm based on low-rank representation
and structure preserving regularization in this paper. To make full use of the
prior knowledge about both the inter-channel correlation and the sparsity in
gradient domain of inner-channel data, this paper combines a low-rank
correlation descriptor with a structure extraction operator as priori
regularization terms for spectral CT reconstruction. Furthermore, a
split-Bregman based iterative algorithm is developed to solve the
reconstruction model. Finally, we propose a multi-channel adaptive parameters
generation strategy according to CT values of each individual energy channel.
Experimental results on numerical simulations and real mouse data indicate that
the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy on both reconstruction and
material decomposition than the methods based on simultaneous algebraic
reconstruction technique (SART), total variation minimization (TVM), total
variation with low-rank (LRTV), and spatial-spectral cube matching frame

TVM, LRTV, and SSCMF correspond to 26.1%, 28.2%, and 29.5%, respectively.

my methods in the creative process chronologically, so I have divided that
section according to the loose structure of my artistic workflow. These
foundations provide a fertile grounding for discussion around topics of subject
matter, reception, community, and ethics. I then conclude with some ideas for
future work in the realms of theory of authorship, explainability tooling, and
research framing.

retrieval with its simplicity and effectiveness. In this work, however, we
reveal that cross-modal contrastive learning suffers from incorrect
normalization of the sum retrieval probabilities of each text or video
instance. Specifically, we show that many test instances are either over- or
under-represented during retrieval, significantly hurting the retrieval
performance. To address this problem, we propose Normalized Contrastive
Learning (NCL) which utilizes the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to compute the
instance-wise biases that properly normalize the sum retrieval probabilities of
each instance so that every text and video instance is fairly represented
during cross-modal retrieval. Empirical study shows that NCL brings consistent
and significant gains in text-video retrieval on different model architectures,
with new state-of-the-art multimodal retrieval metrics on the ActivityNet,
MSVD, and MSR-VTT datasets without any architecture engineering.

  Specifications",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework to simultaneously learn
the communication and distributed control policies for a heterogeneous
multi-agent system (MAS) under complex mission requirements from Capability
Temporal Logic plus (CaTL+) specifications. Both policies are trained,
implemented, and deployed using a novel neural network model called CatlNet.
Taking advantage of the robustness measure of CaTL+, we train CatlNet centrally
to maximize it where network parameters are shared among all agents, allowing
CatlNet to scale to large teams easily. CatlNet can then be deployed
distributedly. A plan repair algorithm is also introduced to guide CatlNet's
training and improve both training efficiency and the overall performance of
CatlNet. The CatlNet approach is tested in simulation and results show that,
after training, CatlNet can steer the decentralized MAS system online to
satisfy a CaTL+ specification with a high success rate.

  overlap with arXiv:2205.05167",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Some recent artificial neural networks (ANNs) claim to model aspects of
primate neural and human performance data. Their success in object recognition
is, however, dependent on exploiting low-level features for solving visual
tasks in a way that humans do not. As a result, out-of-distribution or
adversarial input is often challenging for ANNs. Humans instead learn abstract
patterns and are mostly unaffected by many extreme image distortions. We
introduce a set of novel image transforms inspired by neurophysiological
findings and evaluate humans and ANNs on an object recognition task. We show
that machines perform better than humans for certain transforms and struggle to
perform at par with humans on others that are easy for humans. We quantify the
differences in accuracy for humans and machines and find a ranking of
difficulty for our transforms for human data. We also suggest how certain
characteristics of human visual processing can be adapted to improve the
performance of ANNs for our difficult-for-machines transforms.

  interactions",,,,,"physics.data-an cs.LG physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) include various effects that result from
aerosols entering a cloud, and affecting cloud properties. In general, an
increase in aerosol concentration results in smaller droplet sizes which leads
to larger, brighter, longer-lasting clouds that reflect more sunlight and cool
the Earth. The strength of the effect is however heterogeneous, meaning it
depends on the surrounding environment, making ACI one of the most uncertain
effects in our current climate models. In our work, we use causal machine
learning to estimate ACI from satellite observations by reframing the problem
as a treatment (aerosol) and outcome (change in droplet radius). We predict the
causal effect of aerosol on clouds with uncertainty bounds depending on the
unknown factors that may be influencing the impact of aerosol. Of the three
climate models evaluated, we find that only one plausibly recreates the trend,
lending more credence to its estimate cooling due to ACI.

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in cylindrical geometry, the construction
of symmetry-preserving finite-difference schemes with conservation laws is
carried out. New schemes are constructed starting from the classical completely
conservative Samarsky-Popov schemes. In the case of finite conductivity,
schemes are derived that admit all the symmetries and possess all the
conservation laws of the original differential model, including previously
unknown conservation laws. In the case of a frozen-in magnetic field (when the
conductivity is infinite), various schemes are constructed that possess
conservation laws, including those preserving entropy along trajectories of
motion. The peculiarities of constructing schemes with an extended set of
conservation laws for specific forms of entropy and magnetic fluxes are
discussed.
