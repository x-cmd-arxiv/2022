  super-Eddington blue supergiant","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stad1015",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We conducted one-dimensional stellar evolutionary numerical simulations to
build blue supergiant stellar models with a very low-envelope mass and a
super-Eddington luminosity of 10^7Lo that mimic the last phase of a common
envelope evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) accretes mass from the
envelope and launches jets that power the system. Common envelope jets
supernovae (CEJSNe) are CEE transient events where a NS spirals-in inside the
envelope and then the core of a red supergiant (RSG) star accretes mass and
launches jets that power the transient event. In case that the NS (or black
hole) does not enter the core of the RSG the event is a CEJSN-impostor. We
propose that in some cases a CEJSN-impostor event might end with such a phase
of a blue supergiant lasting for several years to few tens of years. The radius
of the blue supergiant is about tens to few hundreds solar radii. We use a
simple prescription to deposit the jets energy into the envelope. We find that
the expected accretion rate of envelope mass onto the NS at the end of the CEE
allows the power of the jets to be as we assume, 10^7Lo. Such a low-mass
envelope might be the end of the RSG envelope, or might be a rebuilt envelope
from mass fallback. Our study of a blue supergiant at the termination of a
CEJSN-impostor event adds to the rich variety of transients that CEJSNe and
CEJSN-impostors might form.

surrogates as an extension of the standard reduced basis framework. Our
proposal is data-driven, with a domain decomposition of the parameter space,
local reduced basis, and a binary tree as the resulting structure, which are
obtained in an automated way. When compared to the standard global reduced
basis approach, the numerical simulations of our proposal show three salient
features: i) representations of lower dimension with no loss of accuracy, ii) a
significantly higher accuracy for a fixed maximum dimensionality of the basis,
in some cases by orders of magnitude, and iii) results that depend on the
reduced basis seed choice used by the refinement algorithm. We first illustrate
the key parts of our approach with a toy model and then present a more
realistic use case of gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two
spinning, non-precessing black holes. We discuss performance aspects of
hp-greedy, such as overfitting with respect to the depth of the tree structure,
and other hyperparameter dependences. As two direct applications of the
proposed hp-greedy refinement, we envision: i) a further acceleration of
statistical inference, which might be complementary to focused reduced-order
quadratures, and ii) the search of gravitational waves through clustering and
nearest neighbors.

odds with the regular forward shock afterglow model and a sole kilonova

literature. Here we analyze the optical afterglow data available in archive and
construct time-resolved spectra. The significant detection by Keck-I in {\it
G/R} bands at $t\sim 3$ day, which has not been reported before, as well as the
simultaneous Gemini-North {\it r} band measurement, are in favor of a power-law
spectrum that is well consistent with the optical to X-ray spectrum measured at
$t\sim 4.5$ day. However, for $t\leq 2$ day, the spectra are thermal-like and a
straightforward interpretation is a kilonova emission from a neutron star
merger, making it, possibly, the first detection of a very early kilonova
signal at $t\sim 0.05$ day. A non-thermal nature of optical emission at late
times ($t\sim 2$ day), anyhow, can not be ruled out because of the large
uncertainty of the {\it g}-band data. We also propose to classify the neutron
star merger induced optical transients, according to the temporal behaviors of
the kilonova and the non-thermal afterglow emission, into four types. GRB
080503 would then represent the first observation of a sub-group of neutron

the stability and the electronic structure of six computationally predicted

single-crystal phases. In the theoretical analysis based on density-functional
theory (DFT), we identify similarities among the polymorphs based on their
formation energies, charge-density distribution, and electronic properties
(band gaps and density of states). We find striking analogies between the
results obtained for the low- and high-temperature phases of the material,
indirectly confirming that the transition occurring between them mainly
consists of a rigid rotation of the lattice. With this knowledge, we examine
the x-ray absorption spectra from the Sc and F K-edge contrasting
first-principles results obtained from the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation on top of all-electron DFT with high-energy-resolution fluorescence

on the electronic origin of the absorption maxima and provides information on
the prominent excitonic effects that characterize all spectra. Comparison with

real-world spray scenarios significantly. Furthermore, a systematic real-world

validation of spray effects in active perception sensors. Experiments are
conducted on a test track by driving over artificially watered pavement with
varying vehicle speeds, vehicle types and levels of pavement wetness. All

rotational diffusion time $\tau_r$. This implies that motility-induced phase
separation (MIPS) disappears for small $R$. Furthermore, it causes a narrowing

significant reduction in two-cell parameter space, which we use to find
theoretical optimised cascaded line centre filters for Na, K, Rb and Cs across
both D lines. With the exception of Cs, these all have a better figure of merit

where the dimension of the data grows to infinity while the sample sizes from
the two distributions remain fixed. Further, we show that these conditions can
be relaxed when the sample sizes also increase with the dimension, and in such
cases, consistency can be proved even for shrinking alternatives. We use a
simple example involving two normal distributions to prove that even when there
are no consistent tests in the HDLSS regime, the powers of the proposed tests
can converge to unity if the sample sizes increase with the dimension at an
appropriate rate. This rate is obtained by establishing the minimax rate

in various fields of machine learning (ML) research and practice. So far,
however, little is known about the common practice as well as bottlenecks faced
by the community in tackling the research questions posed. To shed light on the
status quo of algorithm development in the specific field of biomedical imaging
analysis, we designed an international survey that was issued to all
participants of challenges conducted in conjunction with the IEEE ISBI 2021 and
MICCAI 2021 conferences (80 competitions in total). The survey covered
participants' expertise and working environments, their chosen strategies, as
well as algorithm characteristics. A median of 72% challenge participants took
part in the survey. According to our results, knowledge exchange was the
primary incentive (70%) for participation, while the reception of prize money
played only a minor role (16%). While a median of 80 working hours was spent on
method development, a large portion of participants stated that they did not
have enough time for method development (32%). 25% perceived the infrastructure
to be a bottleneck. Overall, 94% of all solutions were deep learning-based. Of
these, 84% were based on standard architectures. 43% of the respondents
reported that the data samples (e.g., images) were too large to be processed at
once. This was most commonly addressed by patch-based training (69%),
downsampling (37%), and solving 3D analysis tasks as a series of 2D tasks.
K-fold cross-validation on the training set was performed by only 37% of the
participants and only 50% of the participants performed ensembling based on
multiple identical models (61%) or heterogeneous models (39%). 48% of the
respondents applied postprocessing steps.

vision-based process monitoring typically work well only under specific camera
viewpoints and lighting situations, requiring expensive pre-processing,

we approach the automatic defect detection problem differently using a novel
Semi-Siamese deep learning model that directly compares a reference schematic
of the desired print and a camera image of the achieved print. The model then
solves an image segmentation problem, identifying the locations of defects with
respect to the reference frame. Unlike most change detection problems, our
model is specially developed to handle images coming from different domains and
is robust against perturbations in the imaging setup such as camera angle and
illumination. Defect localization predictions were made in 2.75 seconds per
layer using a standard MacBookPro, which is comparable to the typical tens of
seconds or less for printing a single layer on an inkjet-based 3D printer,

continuous wavelength tuning of a laser when used as an intra-cavity filter.
Their simplicity and good compatibility with generic foundry platforms are
major advantages. However, the difficulty to develop a well-defined and robust
control strategy is an important drawback which restricts the use-cases of
these tunable lasers. Here, we make an in-depth investigation of the tunability
properties of a laser including a single-stage AMZI in its cavity. We find that
due to imperfections of Electro-Optic Phase Modulators (EOPMs), the dependence
of the phase variation with the applied voltage is not linear. Because
integrated EOPMs cannot be individually calibrated, these nonlinearities
prevent a precise and independent tuning of the phase and amplitude of the AMZI
transfer function, and thus continuous tuning cannot be reliably achieved. To
overcome this issue, we propose a refined control strategy which allows for
semi-continuous tuning. With this approach, we demonstrate a piece-wise
continuous tuning of the emission wavelength by taking advantage of the
coupling between amplitude and phase in the AMZI response. With our refined
control strategy, we achieve tuning of the emission wavelength over the full
free spectral range (FSR) of the AMZI.

classes of continuous functions. It is observed that the mode of convergence of
the random series depends on the choice of the scalars $d_n$ and the stochastic
processes. In this article, we have investigated the scalars $d_n,$ which are
chosen to be the Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of functions in some weighted
$L_{[-1,1]}^{p,(\eta,\tau )}$ spaces, so that the random series converges.
Further, the continuity property of the sum functions is studied.

improves detection accuracy for the most severe hallucinations by a factor of 2

vertex weight function $w$ is said to be a well-covered weighting of $G$ if all
its maximal independent sets are of the same weight. The set of all
well-covered weightings of a graph $G$ forms a vector space over the field of
real numbers, called the well-covered vector space of $G$. Since the problem of
recognizing well-covered graphs is $\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{NP}$-complete, the
problem of computing the well-covered vector space of a given graph is
$\mathsf{co}$-$\mathsf{NP}$-hard. Levit and Tankus showed in 2015 that the
problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm in the class of claw-free graph. In
this paper, we give two general reductions for the problem, one based on

challenge for many tasks including tool use, insertion, and dexterous in-hand
manipulation. This task becomes even more difficult when the robot lacks an
accurate model of the object to be grasped. Tactile sensing offers a promising
approach to account for uncertainties in object shape. However, current robotic
hands tend to lack full tactile coverage. As such, a problem arises of how to
plan and execute grasps for multi-fingered hands such that contact is made with
the area covered by the tactile sensors. To address this issue, we propose an
approach to grasp planning that explicitly reasons about where the fingertips
should contact the estimated object surface while maximizing the probability of
grasp success. Key to our method's success is the use of visual surface
estimation for initial planning to encode the contact constraint. The robot
then executes this plan using a tactile-feedback controller that enables the
robot to adapt to online estimates of the object's surface to correct for
errors in the initial plan. Importantly, the robot never explicitly integrates
object pose or surface estimates between visual and tactile sensing, instead it
uses the two modalities in complementary ways. Vision guides the robots motion
prior to contact; touch updates the plan when contact occurs differently than
predicted from vision. We show that our method successfully synthesises and
executes precision grasps for previously unseen objects using surface estimates
from a single camera view. Further, our approach outperforms a state of the art
multi-fingered grasp planner, while also beating several baselines we propose.

stating that crystalline materials melt when the thermal vibrations of their

forces. However, how about another common type of solids: glasses, where the
nature of the solid-liquid crossover is highly controversial? The Lindemann
criterion implies that the thermal expansion coefficients alpha of crystals are
inversely proportional to their melting temperatures. Here we find that,
unexpectedly, alpha of glasses decreases much stronger with increasing
glass-transition temperature Tg marking the liquid-solid crossover in this
material class. However, scaling alpha by the fragility m, a measure of
particle cooperativity, restores the proportionality, i.e., alpha/m ~ 1/Tg.
Obviously, for a glass to become liquid, it is not sufficient to simply
overcome the interparticle binding energies. Instead, more energy has to be
invested to break up the typical cooperative particle network which is
considered a hallmark feature of glassy materials. Surprisingly, alpha of the
liquid phase reveals similar anomalous behaviour and is universally enhanced by
a constant factor of ~3. The found universalities allow estimating
glass-transition temperatures from thermal expansion and vice versa.

latter. We show that this interatomic process can be strongly enhanced by the
presence of an additional third atom, provided the energy of the free-bound
capture transition in the first atom is resonant to a dipole-allowed excitation
energy in this assisting atom. The relation of the resonantly enhanced
three-center electron capture with other processes is discussed, and its
dependencies on the incident electron energy and the spatial geometry of the

diverse communication in social networks (i.e., public and/or private agencies;
local residents) as well as limited mobilization capacity and operational
constraints of physical infrastructure networks. Despite a growing literature
on infrastructure interdependencies and co-dependent social-physical systems,
an in-depth understanding of how risk communication in online social networks
weighs into physical infrastructure networks during a major disaster remains
limited, let alone in compounding risk events. This study analyzes large-scale
datasets of crisis mobility and activity-related social interactions and
concerns available through social media (Twitter) for communities that were
impacted by an ice storm (Oct. 2020) in Oklahoma. Compounded by the COVID-19
pandemic, Oklahoma residents faced this historic ice storm (Oct. 26, 2020-Oct.
29, 2020) that caused devastating traffic impacts (among others) due to
excessive ice accumulation. By using the recently released academic Application
Programming Interface (API) by Twitter that provides complete and unbiased
data, geotagged tweets (approx. 210K) were collected covering the entire state
of Oklahoma, and ice storm-related tweets (approx. 14.2K) were considered.
First, the study uses natural language processing and text quantification
techniques to translate crisis narratives (i.e., tweets). Next, geo-tagged
tweets are mapped into co-located road networks using traditional GIS
techniques. Finally, insights are generated using network science theories and
quantified social narratives to interpret different elements of road networks
(e.g., local roads, freeways, etc.) for the Oklahoma communities that were
impacted by the ice storm event during the pandemic.

matrix fields $A \in L^p(\mathbb{T}^n;\text{Sym}^+(n))$ with $\text{div }(A)$ a
bounded measure. We start by correcting a mistake we noted in our [13,
Corollary 7], which concerns the upper semicontinuity of $\mathbb{D}(A)$ in
$X_p$. We give a proof of a refined correct statement, and we will use it to
study the behaviour of $\mathbb{D}(A)$ when $A \in X_\frac{n}{n-1}$, which is
the critical integrability for $\mathbb{D}(A)$. One of our main results gives
an explicit bound of the measure generated by $\mathbb{D}(A_k)$ for a sequence
of such matrix fields $\{A_k\}_k$. In particular it allows us to characterize
the upper semicontinuity of $\mathbb{D}(A)$ in the case $A \in X_\frac{n}{n -

We propose a Hippocampus-Inspired Cognitive Architecture (HICA) as a neural
mechanism for operant conditioning. HICA explains a learning mechanism in which
agents can learn a new behavior policy in a few trials, as mammals do in
operant conditioning experiments. HICA is composed of two different types of
modules. One is a universal learning module type that represents a cortical
column in the neocortex gray matter. The working principle is modeled as
Modulated Heterarchical Prediction Memory (mHPM). In mHPM, each module learns
to predict a succeeding input vector given the sequence of the input vectors
from lower layers and the context vectors from higher layers. The prediction is
fed into the lower layers as a context signal (top-down feedback signaling),
and into the higher layers as an input signal (bottom-up feedforward
signaling). Rewards modulate the learning rate in those modules to memorize
meaningful sequences effectively. In mHPM, each module updates in a local and
distributed way compared to conventional end-to-end learning with
backpropagation of the single objective loss. This local structure enables the
heterarchical network of modules. The second type is an innate, special-purpose
module representing various organs of the brain's subcortical system. Modules
modeling organs such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and reward center are
pre-programmed to enable instinctive behaviors. The hippocampus plays the role
of the simulator. It is an autoregressive prediction model of the top-most
level signal with a loop structure of memory, while cortical columns are lower
layers that provide detailed information to the simulation. The simulation
becomes the basis for learning with few trials and the deliberate planning
required for operant conditioning.

present new multiband photometric observations of the proposed Ennomos family
and derive precise $g-i$ colors of 75 candidate family members. While the
majority of the targets have visible colors that are indistinguishable from
background objects, we identify 13 objects with closely grouped dynamical
properties that have significantly bluer colors. We determine that the true
Ennomos collisional family is tightly confined to $a'_{p} > 5.29$ au and $0.45
< \sin{i_{p}} < 0.47$, and the majority of its confirmed members have
near-solar spectral slopes, including some of the bluest objects hitherto
discovered in the Trojan population. The property of distinctly neutral colors
that is shared by both the Ennomos family and the previously characterized
Eurybates family indicates that the spectral properties of freshly exposed
surfaces in the Jupiter region are markedly different than the surfaces of
uncollided Trojans. This implies that the processes of ice sublimation and
space weathering at 5.2 au yield a distinct regolith chemistry from the
primordial environment within which the Trojans were initially accreted. It
also suggests that the Trojans were emplaced in their present-day location from
elsewhere sometime after the initial population formed, which is a key
prediction of recent dynamical instability models of solar system evolution.

the localization and mapping performance is impacted, thereby rendering
navigation in such environments unreliable. Optimization-based SLAM solutions,
which are also referred to as Graph SLAM, are widely regarded as state of the
art. In this paper, we utilize a simple and computationally inexpensive glass
detection scheme for detecting glass objects and present the methodology to
incorporate the identified objects into the occupancy grid maintained by such
an algorithm (Google Cartographer). We develop both local (submap level) and
global algorithms for achieving the objective mentioned above and compare the

utilizes particle filter based SLAM.

Furthermore, we investigate the two-point correlation functions, which feature

are similar again, which can be explained by relating the short-time expansion
of quantum annealing to a high-temperature expansion, thus allowing in
principle to find the classical solution already at short times, albeit at

procedure based on the higher-order orthogonal iteration algorithm (HOOI) for
tensor SVD composed with a simplex corner-finding algorithm. We then
demonstrate the consistency of our estimation procedure by providing a per-node

$\ell_{2,\infty}$ tensor perturbation bound for HOOI under independent,
possibly heteroskedastic, subgaussian noise that may be of independent

iterates, and our bounds depend only on spectral properties of the underlying

tensor SVD is computationally feasible. Whereas other leave-one-out analyses
typically focus on sequences constructed by analyzing the output of a given

structure to eliminate a potential additional source of error. Finally, we
apply our methodology to real and simulated data, including applications to two

conditionally independent of a distractor $Z$ given $Y$. Both $Z$ and $Y$ are
assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas $X$ and

of $\varphi(X)$ from residuals of this regression, which is possible with
attractive estimation properties and consistency guarantees. By contrast,
earlier measures of conditional feature dependence require multiple regressions

realistic datasets for comprehensive evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this
paper we first investigate how natural background colors play a role as
spurious features in image classification tasks by manually splitting the test
sets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 into subgroups based on the background color of
each image. We name our datasets CIFAR10-B and CIFAR100-B. We find that while
standard CNNs achieve human-level accuracy, the subgroup performances are not
consistent, and the phenomenon remains even after data augmentation (DA). To
alleviate this issue, we propose FlowAug, a semantic DA method that leverages
the decoupled semantic representations captured by a pre-trained generative
flow. Experimental results show that FlowAug achieves more consistent results
across subgroups than other types of DA methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
Additionally, it shows better generalization performance. Furthermore, we
propose a generic metric for studying model robustness to spurious
correlations, where we take a macro average on the weighted standard deviations
across different classes. Per our metric, FlowAug demonstrates less reliance on
spurious correlations. Although this metric is proposed to study our curated
datasets, it applies to all datasets that have subgroups or subclasses. Lastly,
aside from less dependence on spurious correlations and better generalization
on in-distribution test sets, we also show superior out-of-distribution results

on the foreground colors of the popular CIFAR datasets. Together with CIFAR10-B
and CIFAR100-B, the existing counterpart datasets with information on the
background colors of CIFAR test sets, we assign each image based on its color
contrast level per its foreground and background color labels and use this as a
proxy to study how color contrast affects machine vision. We first conduct a
proof-of-concept study, showing the effect of color difference and validate our
datasets. Furthermore, on a broader level, an important characteristic of human
vision is its robustness against ambient changes; therefore, drawing
inspirations from ophthalmology and the robustness literature, we analogize
contrast sensitivity from the human visual aspect to machine vision and
complement the current robustness study using corrupted images with our

extensive analyses on the effect of color contrast and corrupted images: (1)
model architecture, (2) model size, to measure the perception ability of
machine vision beyond total accuracy. We also explore how task complexity and

turbulent cascade of matter waves. Under continuous forcing at a large length
scale and dissipation at a small one, the gas exhibits a non-thermal, but
stationary state, which is characterised by a power-law momentum distribution
sustained by a scale-invariant momentum-space energy flux. We establish the
amplitude of the momentum distribution and the underlying energy flux as
equilibrium-like state variables, related by an EoS that does not depend on the
details of the energy injection or dissipation, or the history of the system.
Moreover, we show that the equations of state for a wide range of interaction
strengths and gas densities can be empirically scaled onto each other. This
results in a universal dimensionless EoS that sets benchmarks for the theory
and should also be relevant for other turbulent systems.

cost of computing image features. However, this efficient augmentation strategy
has been found to adversely affect the accuracy of CLIP-based training. We
hypothesize that removing a large portion of image tokens may improperly
discard the semantic content associated with a given text description, thus
constituting an incorrect pairing target in CLIP training. To address this
issue, we propose an attentive token removal approach for CLIP training, which
retains tokens with a high semantic correlation to the text description. The
correlation scores are computed in an online fashion using the EMA version of
the visual encoder. Our experiments show that the proposed attentive masking
approach performs better than the previous method of random token removal for
CLIP training. The approach also makes it efficient to apply multiple
augmentation views to the image, as well as introducing instance contrastive
learning tasks between these views into the CLIP framework. Compared to other
CLIP improvements that combine different pre-training targets such as SLIP and
MaskCLIP, our method is not only more effective, but also much more efficient.
Specifically, using ViT-B and YFCC-15M dataset, our approach achieves $43.9\%$

for their promising performance. However, we find that the existing hard sample
mining methods have two problems as follows. 1) In the hardness measurement,
the important structural information is overlooked for similarity calculation,
degrading the representativeness of the selected hard negative samples. 2)
Previous works merely focus on the hard negative sample pairs while neglecting
the hard positive sample pairs. Nevertheless, samples within the same cluster
but with low similarity should also be carefully learned. To solve the
problems, we propose a novel contrastive deep graph clustering method dubbed
Hard Sample Aware Network (HSAN) by introducing a comprehensive similarity
measure criterion and a general dynamic sample weighing strategy. Concretely,
in our algorithm, the similarities between samples are calculated by
considering both the attribute embeddings and the structure embeddings, better
revealing sample relationships and assisting hardness measurement. Moreover,
under the guidance of the carefully collected high-confidence clustering
information, our proposed weight modulating function will first recognize the
positive and negative samples and then dynamically up-weight the hard sample
pairs while down-weighting the easy ones. In this way, our method can mine not
only the hard negative samples but also the hard positive sample, thus
improving the discriminative capability of the samples further. Extensive
experiments and analyses demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

in diffuse gas, including radiative effects from nearby AGN, as well as
emission sourced by stellar populations. Our treatment includes a physically
motivated dust model, which we empirically calibrate to the observed LAE
luminosity function. We then focus on the observability, and physical origin,
of the $z=2$ Lyman-alpha cosmic web, studying the dominant emission mechanisms
and spatial origins. We find that diffuse Lyman-alpha filaments are, in fact,
illuminated by photons which originate, not from the intergalactic medium

emission is primarily sourced by intermediate mass halos ($10^{10} -

circumgalactic media as well as central, young stellar populations.
Observationally, we make predictions for the abundance, area, linear size, and

together necessarily imply the existence of a large population of cosmic MBH
binaries. Such systems are understood to be the loudest sources of
gravitational waves at mHz frequencies, the regime that will be probed by the
next Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It has been proposed that the
rate at which MBHs pair and then bind to form binaries is critically dependent
upon the feedback exerted by the MBHs on the surrounding gaseous environment.
Using the publicly available code GIZMO, we perform a suite of simulations
aimed at studying the dynamics of a MBH pair embedded in a gaseous disk on 100
pc scale. By means of dedicated modules, we follow the dynamics of MBHs in the
presence of different spin-dependent radiative feedback models, and compare the
results to a benchmark case with no feedback at all. Our main finding is that
feedback causes the secondary MBH to shrink its orbit at a reduced pace, when
compared to models where feedback is absent. Moreover, such slower inspiral
occurs on eccentric orbits, as feedback has the net effect of hampering the
circularization process. Though idealized in many aspects, our study highlights
and quantifies the importance of including spin-dependent feedback recipes in
hydrodynamic simulations of MBH pairs, and ultimately in assessing the
cosmological coalescence rate of such systems in view of their detection
through gravitational waves.

redshift galaxies. This method allows us to study the internal structure and
assembly of the first generations of galaxies. We find clear gradients both in
the empirical colour maps, as well as in most of the estimated physical
parameters. We find regions of considerably different specific star formation
rates across each galaxy, which points to very bursty star-formation happening
on small scales, not galaxy-wide. The integrated light is dominated by these
bursty regions, which exhibit strong line emission detected by NIRSpec and also
inferred from the broad-band NIRCam images, with the equivalent width of
[OIII]+H$\beta$ reaching up to $\sim3000-4000$\AA rest-frame in these regions.
Studying these galaxies in an integrated approach yields extremely young
inferred ages of the stellar population ($<$10 Myr), which outshine older
stellar populations that are only distinguishable in the spatially resolved
maps. This leads to inferring $\sim0.5-1$ dex lower stellar masses by using
aperture photometry, when compared to resolved analyses. Such systematics would
have strong implications in the shape and evolution of the stellar mass
function at these early times, particularly while samples are limited to small
numbers of the brightest candidates. Furthermore, the evolved stellar
populations revealed in this study imply an extended process of early galaxy
formation that could otherwise be hidden behind the light of the most recently

any ambiguities arising from an ad-hoc mode truncation. Our findings show that
while the effect of confinement per se is not enough to result in substantial

feature strongly in a wealth of scientific and industrial contexts - has been
identified as one of the core potential fields of applicability of quantum
computers. It is still unclear, however, to what extent quantum algorithms can
actually outperform classical algorithms for this type of problems. In this
work, by resorting to computational learning theory and cryptographic notions,
we prove that quantum computers feature a super-polynomial advantage over
classical computers in approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization
problems. Specifically, building on seminal work by Kearns and Valiant, we have
identified special types of problems that are hard for classical computers to
approximate. Despite this, we give a quantum algorithm such that an optimal
solution can be efficiently approximated by quantum computers. The advantage
for special instances of the so-called integer programming problem is shown to
be super-polynomial. This result shows that quantum devices have the power to
approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the reach of classical
efficient algorithms. Our results also give clear guidance on how to construct
such advantage-bearing problem instances.

Large Binocular Telescope we were able to resolve, for the first time,
individual stars in the gas-rich galaxy DDO68 C. This system was already
suggested to be interacting with the extremely metal poor dwarf DDO68, but its
nature has remained elusive so far because of the presence of a bright
foreground star close to its line of sight, that hampers a detailed study of
its stellar population and distance. In our study, we turned this interloper
star into an opportunity to have a deeper insight on DDO68 C, using it as a
guide star for the AO correction. Although the new data do not allow for a
direct distance measurement through the red giant branch tip method, the
combined analysis of the resolved-star color-magnitude diagram, of archival
GALEX FUV and NUV photometry, and of H$\alpha$ data provides a self-consistent
picture in which DDO68 C is at the same $\sim$13 Mpc distance as its candidate
companion DDO68. These results indicate that DDO68 is a unique case of a low
mass dwarf, less massive than the Magellanic Clouds, interacting with three
satellites (DDO68 C and two previously confirmed accreting systems), providing
useful constraints on cosmological models and a potential explanation for its
anomalous extremely low metallicity.

advantages over traditional joining techniques. While methods to study the
failure of adhesives typically apply tensile loads to the adhesive joint, less
is known about the performance of soft adhesives under shear and torsion, which
may become important in engineering applications. A major challenge that has
hindered the characterization of shear/torsion-induced delamination is imposed
by the fact that, even after delamination, contact with the substrate is
maintained, thus allowing for frictional sliding and re-adhesion. In this work,
we address this gap by studying the controlled delamination of soft cylinders
under combined compression and torsion. Our experimental observations expose
the nucleation of delamination at an imperfection and its propagation along the
circumference of the cylinder. The observed sequence of `stick-slip' events and
the sensitivity of the delamination process to material parameters are
explained by a theoretical model that captures axisymmetric delamination
patterns, along with the subsequent frictional sliding and re-adhesion. By
opening up an avenue for improved characterization of adhesive failure, our
experimental approach and theoretical framework can guide the design of
adhesives in future applications.

efficient sub-volume selection necessary in neuroanatomical navigation. We
assessed seven user-interaction methods with multiple input modalities (gaze,

context of annotating brain aneurysms for cerebrovascular surgery. Furthermore,
we proposed and evaluated a novel technique, called magnified selection diorama

Both quantitative and semi-quantitative (i.e., NASA Task Load Index) metrics
were employed through user studies to reveal the performance of each

evaluations demonstrated that controller-based interaction is preferred over
eye-tracking-based methods for point placement while voice recording and
virtual keyboard typing are better than freehand writing for note-taking.
Furthermore, our new Maserama sub-volume selection technique was proven to be
highly efficient and easy-to-use. Our study is the first to provide a

been made to target this problem, they are limited to considering only
class-level imbalance. In this work, we argue that for graphs, the imbalance is
likely to exist at the sub-class topology group level. Due to the flexibility
of topology structures, graphs could be highly diverse, and learning a
generalizable classification boundary would be difficult. Therefore, several
majority topology groups may dominate the learning process, rendering others

important for understanding energy fractionations in stellar flares, and for
constraining the associated incident radiation on a planetary atmosphere. We
follow up on the NUV flare detections presented in Brasseur et al. 2019, using
coincident Kepler long (1557 flares) and short (2 flares) cadence light curves.
We find no evidence of optical flares at these times, and place limits on the
flare energy ratio between the two wavebands. We find that the energy ratio is
correlated with GALEX band energy, and extends over a range of about three
orders of magnitude in the ratio of the upper limit of Kepler band flare energy
to NUV flare energy at the same time for each flare. The two flares with Kepler
short cadence data indicate that the true Kepler band energy may be much lower
than the long cadence based upper limit. A similar trend appears for the bulk
flare energy properties of non-simultaneously observed flares on the same
stars. We provide updated models to describe the flare spectral energy
distribution from the NUV through the optical including continua and emission
lines to improve upon blackbody-only models. The spread of observed energy

set of linear models are jointly trained on a collection of datasets

sparsity patterns (i.e., different supports), we propose a modeling framework
for MTL that encourages models to share information across tasks, for a given
covariate, through separately 1) shrinking the coefficient supports together,
and/or 2) shrinking the coefficient values together. This allows models to
borrow strength during variable selection even when the coefficient values
differ markedly between tasks. We express our modeling framework as a
Mixed-Integer Program, and propose efficient and scalable algorithms based on
block coordinate descent and combinatorial local search. We show our estimator
achieves statistically optimal prediction rates. Importantly, our theory
characterizes how our estimator leverages the shared support information across
tasks to achieve better variable selection performance. We evaluate the
performance of our method in simulations and two biology applications. Our
proposed approaches outperform other sparse MTL methods in variable selection
and prediction accuracy. Interestingly, penalties that shrink the supports
together often outperform penalties that shrink the coefficient values
together. We will release an R package implementing our methods.

  Models","23 pages, 18 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative models have been widely studied in computer vision. Recently,
diffusion models have drawn substantial attention due to the high quality of
their generated images. A key desired property of image generative models is
the ability to disentangle different attributes, which should enable
modification towards a style without changing the semantic content, and the
modification parameters should generalize to different images. Previous studies
have found that generative adversarial networks (GANs) are inherently endowed
with such disentanglement capability, so they can perform disentangled image
editing without re-training or fine-tuning the network. In this work, we
explore whether diffusion models are also inherently equipped with such a
capability. Our finding is that for stable diffusion models, by partially
changing the input text embedding from a neutral description (e.g., ""a photo of
person"") to one with style (e.g., ""a photo of person with smile"") while fixing
all the Gaussian random noises introduced during the denoising process, the
generated images can be modified towards the target style without changing the
semantic content. Based on this finding, we further propose a simple,
light-weight image editing algorithm where the mixing weights of the two text
embeddings are optimized for style matching and content preservation. This
entire process only involves optimizing over around 50 parameters and does not
fine-tune the diffusion model itself. Experiments show that the proposed method
can modify a wide range of attributes, with the performance outperforming
diffusion-model-based image-editing algorithms that require fine-tuning. The
optimized weights generalize well to different images. Our code is publicly

(Kaiser squashing and another with a window function on $\beta$ that selects
out the coherent radial infall pairwise velocities, $M_A$ and $M_B$,
respectively), two models for the nonlinear impact of baryons that smears the
BAO signal (a fixed ratio between the smearing scales in the perpendicular and
parallel dimensions and another where these smearing scales are kept as a free
parameters, P$_{dw}(k|k_*)$ and P$_{dw}(k|\Sigma_\perp,\Sigma_\parallel)$,
respectively), and two analytical emulations of nonlinear growth (one employing
the halo model and another formulated from simulated galaxy clustering of a
semi-analytical model, $F_{HM}$ and $F_{SAM}$, respectively). We find that the
best model combination employing $F_{HM}$ is $P_{dw}(k|k_*)*F_{HM}*M_B$, while
the best combination employing $F_{SAM}$ is $P_{dw}(k|k_*)*F_{SAM}*M_B$, which
leads to unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters. We compare these to
the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure perturbation theory model
$P_{EFT}(k|\Theta)$, and find that our simple phenomenological models are

dark energy and testing gravity using Roman in an accurate and robust manner.

jets/lobes overlapping their companion. Our final census indicates a dAGN duty
cycle slightly higher than predictions of purely stochastic fueling, although a
larger sample (potentially culled from VLASS) is needed to fully address the

which quantifies the response of the system to a uniform electric field in the
infinitely long timescale. The Drude weight is often discussed in terms of the
Kohn formula, which gives the Drude weight by the derivative of the energy
eigenvalue of a finite-size system with the periodic boundary condition in
terms of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. Recently, the Kohn formula is generalized to
nonlinear responses. However, the nonlinear Drude weight determined by the Kohn
formula often diverges in the thermodynamic limit. In order to elucidate the
issue, in this work we examine a simple example of a one-dimensional
tight-binding model in the presence of a single defect at zero temperature. We
find that its linear and non-linear Drude weights given by the Kohn formula (i)
depend on the Aharonov-Bohm flux and (ii) diverge proportionally to a power of
the system size. We argue that the problem can be attributed to different order
of limits. The Drude weight according to the Kohn formula (``Kohn--Drude
weight'') indicates the response of a finite-size system to an adiabatic
insertion of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. While it is a well-defined physical
quantity for a finite-size system, its thermodynamic limit does not always
describe the ballistic transport of the bulk. The latter should be rather
characterized by a ``bulk Drude weight'' defined by taking the thermodynamic
limit first before the zero-frequency limit. While the potential issue of the
order of limits has been sometimes discussed within the linear response, the
discrepancy between the two limits is amplified in nonlinear Drude weights. We
demonstrate the importance of the low-energy excitations of $O(1/L)$, which are
excluded from the Kohn--Drude weight, in regularizing the bulk Drude weight.

for causal reasoning, allowing us to express interventional and counterfactual
queries. Given a path formula $\phi$, an interventional property is concerned
with the satisfaction probability of $\phi$ if we apply a particular change $I$
to the MDP (e.g., switching to a different policy); a counterfactual allows us
to compute, given an observed MDP path $\tau$, what the outcome of $\phi$ would
have been had we applied $I$ in the past. For its ability to reason about
different configurations of the MDP, our approach represents a departure from
existing probabilistic temporal logics that can only reason about a fixed
system configuration. From a syntactic viewpoint, we introduce a generalized
counterfactual operator that subsumes both interventional and counterfactual
probabilities as well as the traditional probabilistic operator found in e.g.,
PCTL. From a semantics viewpoint, our logic is interpreted over a structural
causal model (SCM) translation of the MDP, which gives us a representation
amenable to counterfactual reasoning. We provide a proof-of-concept evaluation

spaces. More precisely, assume that $E$ is a symmetric quasi-Banach function
space on $(0, \infty)$ satisfying some natural conditions, $0<\theta<1$, and
$0<r\leq \infty$. If $(E,L_\infty)_{\theta,r}=F$, then \[
\big(\h_E^c(\mathcal{M}), \h_\infty^c(\mathcal{M})\big)_{\theta,
r}=\h_{F}^c(\mathcal{M}). \] As an illustration, we obtain that if $\Phi$ is an
Orlicz function that is $p$-convex and $q$-concave for some $0<p\leq q<\infty$,
then the following interpolation on the noncommutative column Orlicz-Hardy
space holds: for $0<\theta<1$, $0<r\leq \infty$, and
$\Phi_0^{-1}(t)=[\Phi^{-1}(t)]^{1-\theta}$ for $t>0$,
  \[
  \big(\h_\Phi^c(\mathcal{M}), \h_\infty^c(\mathcal{M})\big)_{\theta,
r}=\h_{\Phi_0, r}^c(\mathcal{M})
  \]
  where $\h_{\Phi_0,r}^c(\mathcal{M})$ is the noncommutative column Hardy space
associated with the Orlicz-Lorentz space $L_{\Phi_0,r}$.

Often HPC systems have higher security levels compared to Cloud systems, which

need to include a heavy package of libraries making their size relatively
large. These libraries usually are specifically optimised for the hardware,
which compromises portability of containers. Per contra, a Cloud container has
smaller volume and is more portable. Furthermore, containers would benefit from
orchestrators that facilitate deployment and management of containers at a

some solutions to enable container orchestration on HPC systems have been
proposed in state of the art. This paper gives a survey and taxonomy of efforts

addition, we show that there is no statistically significant difference between
the results obtained from our simulated testbed and a hardware testbed with
identical configurations. Finally we describe lessons learned from our

driven by acoustic waves at $\sim\!10^6$~Hz frequency and beyond. We measured
such a droplet's interfacial response to 6.6~MHz ultrasound to gain insight
into the energy transfer mechanism that spans these vastly different
timescales, using high-speed microscopic digital transmission holography, a
unique method to capture three-dimensional surface dynamics at nanometer space
and microsecond time resolutions. We show that low-frequency capillary waves
are driven into existence via a feedback mechanism between the acoustic
radiation pressure and the evolving shape of the fluid interface. The acoustic
pressure is distributed in the standing wave cavity of the droplet, and as the
shape of the fluid interface changes in response to the distributed pressure
present on the interface, the standing wave field also changes shape, feeding
back to produce changes in the acoustic radiation pressure distribution in the
cavity. A physical model explicitly based upon this proposed mechanism is
provided, and simulations using it were verified against direct observations of
both the microscale droplet interface dynamics from holography and internal
pressure distributions using microparticle image velocimetry. The
pressure-interface feedback model accurately predicts the vibration amplitude
threshold at which capillary waves appear, the subsequent amplitude and

  Scattering Problem",,,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the inverse acoustic obstacle problem for sound-soft star-shaped
obstacles in two dimensions wherein the boundary of the obstacle is determined
from measurements of the scattered field at a collection of receivers outside
the object. One of the standard approaches for solving this problem is to
reformulate it as an optimization problem: finding the boundary of the domain
that minimizes the $L^2$ distance between computed values of the scattered
field and the given measurement data. The optimization problem is
computationally challenging since the local set of convexity shrinks with
increasing frequency and results in an increasing number of local minima in the
vicinity of the true solution. In many practical experimental settings, low
frequency measurements are unavailable due to limitations of the experimental
setup or the sensors used for measurement. Thus, obtaining a good initial guess
for the optimization problem plays a vital role in this environment.
  We present a neural network warm-start approach for solving the inverse
scattering problem, where an initial guess for the optimization problem is
obtained using a trained neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method with several numerical examples. For high frequency problems, this
approach outperforms traditional iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton
initialized without any prior (i.e., initialized using a unit circle), or
initialized using the solution of a direct method such as the linear sampling
method. The algorithm remains robust to noise in the scattered field
measurements and also converges to the true solution for limited aperture data.
However, the number of training samples required to train the neural network
scales exponentially in frequency and the complexity of the obstacles
considered. We conclude with a discussion of this phenomenon and potential
directions for future research.

the sampling frequency in this direction are substantially lower than the axial
one, and a lack of carrier signal in this direction. In computer vision
applications, the axial and the lateral motions are independent. In contrast,
the tissue motion pattern in USE is governed by laws of physics which link the

theoretical research on Taylor-Couette flow. The flows of interest rotate
differentially with inner cylinder faster than outer one but are linearly
stable against Rayleigh's inviscid centrifugal instability. At shear Reynolds
numbers as large as 10^6, hydrodynamic flows of this type (quasi-keplerian)
appear to be nonlinearly stable: no turbulence is seen that cannot be
attributed to interaction with the axial boundaries, rather than the radial
shear itself. Direct numerical simulations agree, although they cannot yet
reach such high Reynolds numbers. This result indicates that accretion-disc
turbulence is not purely hydrodynamic in origin, at least insofar as it is
driven by radial shear. Theory, however, predicts linear magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) instabilities in astrophysical discs: in particular, the standard
magnetorotational instability (SMRI). MHD Taylor-Couette experiments aimed at
SMRI are challenged by the low magnetic Prandtl numbers of liquid metals. High
fluid Reynolds numbers and careful control of the axial boundaries are
required. The quest for laboratory SMRI has been rewarded with the discovery of
some interesting inductionless cousins of SMRI, and the recently reported
success in demonstrating SMRI itself by taking advantage of conducting axial
boundaries. Some outstanding questions and near-future prospects are discussed,

interactive system while increasing in flexibility with a larger penetration of
renewable energy sources, demand prediction on a short-term resolution will
inevitably become more and more crucial in designing and managing the future
grid, especially when it comes to an individual household level. Projecting the
demand for electricity for a single energy user, as opposed to the aggregated
power consumption of residential load on a wide scale, is difficult because of
a considerable number of volatile and uncertain factors. This paper proposes a
customized GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture to address this challenging problem. LSTM and GRU are
comparatively newer and among the most well-adopted deep learning approaches.
The electricity consumption datasets were obtained from individual household
smart meters. The comparison shows that the LSTM model performs better for
home-level forecasting than alternative prediction techniques-GRU in this case.
To compare the NN-based models with contrast to the conventional statistical
technique-based model, ARIMA based model was also developed and benchmarked
with LSTM and GRU model outcomes in this study to show the performance of the
proposed model on the collected time series data.

classes of continuous non-bandlimited signals that have a small number of free
parameters from their low-rate discrete samples. This task is often translated
into a spectral estimation problem that is solved using methods involving
estimating signal subspaces, which tend to break down at a certain peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). To avoid this breakdown, we consider alternative
approaches that make use of information from labelled data. We propose two
model-based learning methods, including deep unfolding the denoising process in
spectral estimation, and constructing an encoder-decoder deep neural network
that models the acquisition process. Simulation results of both learning
algorithms indicate significant improvements of the breakdown PSNR over
classical subspace-based methods. While the deep unfolded network achieves
similar performance as the classical FRI techniques and outperforms the
encoder-decoder network in the low noise regimes, the latter allows to
reconstruct the FRI signal even when the sampling kernel is unknown. We also
achieve competitive results in detecting pulses from in vivo calcium imaging
data in terms of true positive and false positive rate while providing more
precise estimations.

Activity-based accessibility is used to reflect the changes from AVs in
transport costs. The year 2040 is set as the backdrop for the analyses, where
the effects of the decreased population are reflected in the scenario settings,
along with some other variables to accommodate the uncertainties in the

expand by 7.2% and 41.6% for two AV scenarios, respectively. Two hypothetical

that providing a 20% subsidy to the land price is effective for the scenario

that the worst-case Dilution of Precision (DOP) is minimized.
  Building on prior results on DOP scaling laws for beyond convex hull
ToA-based localization, we propose a novel metric termed the Range-Normalized
DOP (RNDOP). We show that the worst-case DOP-optimal anchor placement problem
simplifies to a min-max RNDOP-optimal anchor placement problem. Unfortunately,
this formulation results in a non-convex and intractable problem under
realistic constraints. To overcome this, we propose iterative anchor addition
schemes, which result in a tractable albeit non-convex problem. By exploiting
the structure arising from the resultant rank-1 update, we devise three
heuristic schemes with varying performance-complexity tradeoffs. In addition,
we also derive the upper and lower bounds for scenarios where we are placing
anchors to optimize the worst-case (a) 3D positioning error and (b) 2D
positioning error. We build on these results to design a cohesive iterative
algorithmic framework for robust anchor placement and then discuss the
computational complexity of the proposed schemes. Using numerical results, we
validate the accuracy of our theoretical results. We also present comprehensive

statistics based on a simple principle: that we should prioritize variables in

is threefold. First, we argue that feature statistics should estimate ""oracle
masked likelihood ratios,"" which are Neyman-Pearson statistics for
discriminating between features and knockoffs using partially observed (masked)
data. Second, we introduce the masked likelihood ratio (MLR) statistic, a
knockoff statistic that estimates the oracle MLR. We show that MLR statistics
are asymptotically average-case optimal, i.e., they maximize the expected
number of discoveries made by knockoffs when averaging over a user-specified
prior on unknown parameters. Our optimality result places no explicit
restrictions on the problem dimensions or the unknown relationship between the
response and covariates; instead, we assume a ""local dependence"" condition
which depends only on simple quantities that can be calculated from the data.
Third, in simulations and three real data applications, we show that MLR
statistics outperform state-of-the-art feature statistics, including in
settings where the prior is highly misspecified. We implement MLR statistics in
the open-source python package knockpy; our implementation is often (although
not always) faster than computing a cross-validated lasso.

that hosts neutral Fermi surfaces inside the gap. In an external magnetic
field, it has been pointed out that the neutral Fermi surfaces are Landau
quantized to form Landau levels (LLs) due to the induced emergent gauge
magnetic field. In this work, we calculate the electronic density of states
(DOS) of the QSL in an orbital magnetic field. We find that the LLs from the
neutral Fermi surfaces give rise to a set of steps emerging at the upper and
lower Hubbard band edges. Each of the Hubbard band edge steps further develop
into a band edge resonance peak when a weak gauge binding from the gauge field
fluctuations is taken into account. Importantly, each Hubbard band edge step
and its resulting resonance peak in the weak gauge binding are found to have a
correspondence LL from the neutral Fermi surfaces, so the Hubbard band edge
steps and the band edge resonance peaks are the unique features that
characterize the Landau quantization of the in-gap neutral Fermi surfaces. We
further consider the strong gauge binding regime where the band edge resonance
peaks move into the Mott gap and develop into true in-gap bound states. In the
strong gauge binding regime, we solve the bound state LL spectrum. For the
bound state with a Mexican hat like band dispersion, we find that the envelop
energy to have a state excited from the bound state LL decreases quadratically
with the magnetic field. The quadratic decrease behavior of the envelop energy
is consistent with the intuition that applying magnetic field localizes the
states and energetically promotes the in-gap bound states formation. Finally,
we connect our results to the electronic DOS spectra measured in the layered
1T-TaS$_2$. We point out that a QSL with a quasi-bound state in the upper
Hubbard band can give the DOS spectra similar to the one measured in the

anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field but lifts that of spin parallel
states. In quantum spin liquids where the spin and charge degrees of freedom
are fractionalized, anomalous Zeeman response may be expected. In the case of
spin liquids with spinon Fermi surface, the threshold energy to excite an
electronic state is found to exhibit no Zeeman shift. This is specific to the
spinon Fermi surface case. In contrast, other gapped spin liquids are expected
to exhibit the standard Zeeman shift at the band edge even though they also
exhibit spin-charge fractionalization. When gauge field fluctuations are
included, we find that the Zeeman shift of the electronic states gets affected
by the gauge field induced binding. In the electronic density of states
spectra, weak gauge binding induces band edge resonance peaks which exhibit the
Zeeman shift in the same direction as that in the standard Zeeman effect, but
the shift is reduced as the binding potential increases. With further increase
in the binding potential the resonance becomes true in-gap bound states and
eventually the shift direction reverses so it is opposite to the standard
Zeeman effect. We propose that one can perform spin polarized scanning
tunneling microscope measurements as a test of the spinon Fermi sea ground
state in quantum spin liquid candidate materials.

levels of complexity have been proposed, each has its own limitations. For
example, simple first-order closure schemes such as the K-Profile
Parameterization (KPP) lack energetic constraints; two-equation models like
$k-\epsilon$ directly solve an equation for the turbulent kinetic energy but do
not account for non-local fluxes, and high-order closures that include the
non-local transport terms are computationally expensive. To address these, here
we extend the Assumed-Distribution Higher-Order Closure (ADC) framework
originally proposed for the atmospheric boundary layer and apply it to the
ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL). By assuming a probability distribution
function relationship between the vertical velocity and tracers, all
second-order and higher-order moments are exactly constructed and turbulence
closure is achieved in the ADC scheme. In addition, the ADC parameterization
scheme has full energetic constraints. We have tested the ADC scheme against a
combination of large eddy simulation (LES), KPP, and $k-\epsilon$ for surface
buoyancy-driven convective mixing and found that the ADC scheme is robust with
different vertical resolutions and compares well to the LES results.

physical and biological systems. In spite of their diverse structure and
function, a commonality is that the linkers diffuse on timescales much faster
compared to the overall motion of the particles they bind to. This limits
numerical and theoretical approaches that need to resolve these diverse
timescales with high accuracy. Many models, therefore, resort to effective, yet
ad-hoc, dynamics, where linker motion is only accounted for when bound. This
paper provides a mathematical justification for such coarse-grained dynamics
that preserves detailed balance at equilibrium. Our derivation is based on
multiscale averaging techniques and is broadly applicable. We verify our
results with simulations on a minimal model of fast linker binding to a slow
particle. We show how our framework can be applied to various systems,
including those with multiple linkers, stiffening linkers upon binding, or slip
bonds with force-dependent unbinding. Importantly, the preservation of detailed
balance only sets the ratio of the binding to the unbinding rates, but it does
not constrain the detailed expression of binding kinetics. We conclude by
discussing how various choices of binding kinetics may affect macroscopic
dynamics.

Personalized Federated Recommender Systems (PersonalFR), which introduces a
personalized autoencoder-based recommendation model with Federated Learning
(FL) to address these challenges. PersonalFR guarantees that each user can
learn a personal model from the local dataset and other participating users'
data without sharing local data, data embeddings, or models. PersonalFR
consists of three main components, including AutoEncoder-based RSs (ARSs) that

Partial Compression (PC) that only computes and transmits active model

driving systems, and learning-based behavior planning presents a promising
pathway toward achieving this objective. Distinguished from existing
learning-based methods that directly output decisions, this work introduces a
predictive behavior planning framework that learns to predict and evaluate from
human driving data. This framework consists of three components: a behavior
generation module that produces a diverse set of candidate behaviors in the
form of trajectory proposals, a conditional motion prediction network that
predicts future trajectories of other agents based on each proposal, and a
scoring module that evaluates the candidate plans using maximum entropy inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL). We validate the proposed framework on a
large-scale real-world urban driving dataset through comprehensive experiments.
The results show that the conditional prediction model can predict distinct and
reasonable future trajectories given different trajectory proposals and the
IRL-based scoring module can select plans that are close to human driving. The
proposed framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of similarity to
human driving trajectories. Additionally, we find that the conditional
prediction model improves both prediction and planning performance compared to
the non-conditional model. Lastly, we note that learning the scoring module is
crucial for aligning the evaluations with human drivers.

accelerates particles considerably faster than in the parallel propagation
regime. However, the perpendicular acceleration stops after the shock overruns
a circular particle orbit. At the same time, it may continue in flows resulting
from supersonically colliding plasmas bound by a pair of perpendicular shocks.
Although the double-shock acceleration mechanism, which we consider in detail,
is not advantageous for thermal particles, pre-energized particles may avoid
the premature end of acceleration. We argue that if their gyroradius exceeds
the dominant turbulence scale between the shocks, these particles might
traverse the intershock space repeatedly before being carried away by the
shocked plasma. Moreover, entering the space between the shocks of similar
velocities $u_{1}\approx u_{2}\approx c$, such particles start bouncing between
the shocks at a fixed angle $\approx 35.3^{\circ}$ to the shock surface. Their
drift along the shock fronts is slow, $V_{d}\sim\left|u_{2}-u_{1}\right|\ll c$,
so that it will take $N\sim Lc/\left|u_{2}-u_{1}\right|d\gg1$ bounces before
they escape the accelerator (here, $L$ is the size of the shocks and $d$ is the
gap between them). Since these particles more than ten-fold their energy per
cycle (two consecutive bounces), we invoke other possible losses that can limit
the acceleration. They include drifts due to rippled shocks, the nonparallel
mutual orientation of the upstream magnetic fields, and radiative losses.

promise to achieve significantly higher utility than value perturbation
mechanisms in many time series analysis. However, its practicability is still
undermined by two factors, namely, utility cost of extra missing or empty

inherently eliminates the cost of missing, empty or repeated values. Optimizing
switch operation in a {\it stateful} manner, we then propose $StaSwitch$

the instability sets in at ${\bf q}$ momenta forming a ring around ${\bf

so far, and is not likely to be totally replaced in foreseeable future.
Password authentication offers several desirable properties (e.g., low-cost,
highly available, easy-to-implement, reusable). However, it suffers from a
critical security issue mainly caused by the inability to memorize complicated
strings of humans. Users tend to choose easy-to-remember passwords which are
not uniformly distributed in the key space. Thus, user-selected passwords are
susceptible to guessing attacks. In order to encourage and support users to use
strong passwords, it is necessary to simulate automated password guessing
methods to determine the passwords' strength and identify weak passwords. A
large number of password guessing models have been proposed in the literature.
However, little attention was paid to the task of providing a systematic survey
which is necessary to review the state-of-the-art approaches, identify gaps,
and avoid duplicate studies. Motivated by that, we conduct a comprehensive
survey on all password guessing studies presented in the literature from 1979
to 2022. We propose a generic methodology map to present an overview of
existing methods. Then, we explain each representative approach in detail. The
experimental procedures and available datasets used to evaluate password
guessing models are summarized, and the reported performances of representative
studies are compared. Finally, the current limitations and the open problems as
future research directions are discussed. We believe that this survey is
helpful to both experts and newcomers who are interested in password security

compute the residual vector of the linear system in each iteration. Thus, we
have to access all the rows of the data matrix in these methods, which are

to efficiently choose working rows in randomized block Kaczmarz-type methods

shook the world and took millions of lives in the ensuing years. Many
governments and health officials failed to arrest the rapid circulation of
infection in their communities. The long incubation period and the large
proportion of asymptomatic cases made COVID-19 particularly elusive to track.
However, wastewater monitoring soon became a promising data source in addition
to conventional indicators such as confirmed daily cases, hospitalizations, and
deaths. Despite the consensus on the effectiveness of wastewater viral load
data, there is a lack of methodological approaches that leverage viral load to
improve COVID-19 forecasting. This paper proposes using deep learning to
automatically discover the relationship between daily confirmed cases and viral
load data. We trained one Deep Temporal Convolutional Networks (DeepTCN) and
one Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to build a global forecasting
model. We supplement the daily confirmed cases with viral loads and other
socio-economic factors as covariates to the models. Our results suggest that
TFT outperforms DeepTCN and learns a better association between viral load and
daily cases. We demonstrated that equipping the models with the viral load
improves their forecasting performance significantly. Moreover, viral load is
shown to be the second most predictive input, following the containment and
health index. Our results reveal the feasibility of training a
location-agnostic deep-learning model to capture the dynamics of infection
diffusion when wastewater viral load data is provided.

oscillations with short periods (<200 s) of coronal loops in an active region,
i.e., NOAA 12965. A total of 111 coronal loops are identified in EUI 174 A

decaying, regarding as decayless oscillations. Oscillatory periods are measured
from about 11 s to 185 s, with a median period of 40 s. Thus, they are also
termed as short-period oscillations. The corresponding loop lengths are
measured from about 10.5 Mm to 30.2 Mm, and a strong dependence of oscillatory
periods on loop lengths is established, indicating that the short-period
oscillations are standing kink-mode waves in nature. Based on the coronal
seismology, kink speeds are measured to about 330-1910 km/s, and magnetic field
strengths in coronal loops are estimated to about 4.1-25.2 G, while the energy
flux carried by decayless kink oscillations lies in the range from roughly 7 W

formation is the giant impact stage, where protoplanets gravitationally scatter
and collide with each other and then evolve into a stable planetary system. We
investigate the effect of the stellar mass on the architecture of planetary
systems formed by giant impacts. We perform {\it N}-body simulations around

protoplanets, we distribute the initial protoplanets in 0.05--0.15 au from the

planets increases as the stellar mass decreases, while the number of planets
decreases. The eccentricity and inclination of orbits and the orbital
separation of adjacent planets increase with decreasing the stellar mass. This
is because as the stellar mass decreases, the relative strength of planetary

typically accompany high computation cost and numerous redundant weight
parameters. To reduce the FLOPs, structure pruning is a popular approach to
remove the entire hidden structures via introducing coarse-grained sparsity.
Meanwhile, plentiful pruning works leverage fine-grained sparsity instead

designed computing library for potential speedup. In this technical report, we
study and present an efficient convolution neural network inference system to
accelerate its forward pass by utilizing the fine-grained sparsity of

specialized designed sparse data structures, operators and associated
algorithms. Experimentally, we validate that FSCNN outperforms standard deep
learning library PyTorch on popular CNN architectures such as VGG16 if
sufficiently high sparsity exhibits. However, due to the contiguity issue of
sparse operators, FSCNN is typically not comparable with highly optimized dense
operator. Therefore, coarse-grained (structured) sparsity is our recommendation
for generic model compression.

Explainable AI (XAI) aims to address this requirement by clarifying AI

This paper proposes a methodology to support clinicians in identifying failures

pillars: decomposing the feature set by leveraging clinical context latent
space, assessing the clinical association of global explanations, and Latent
Space Similarity (LSS) based local explanations. We demonstrated our

For example, analogies have been used to understand black hole physics, leading
to the development of a thermodynamic theory for these objects and the
discovery of the Hawking effect. The latter, which results from quantum field
theory on black hole space-times, changed the way physicists approached this
subject: what had started as a mere aid to understanding becomes a possible
source of evidence via the research programme of `analogue gravity' that builds
on analogue models for field effects. Some of these analogue models may and can
be realised in the laboratory, allowing experimental tests of field effects.
Here, we present a historical perspective on the connection between the Hawking
effect and analogue models. We also present a literature review of current
research, bringing history and contemporary physics together. We argue that the
history of analogue gravity and the Hawking effect is divided into three
distinct phases based on how and why analogue models have been used to
investigate fields in the vicinity of black holes. Furthermore, we find that
modern research signals a transition to a new phase, where the impetus for the
use of analogue models has surpassed the problem they were originally designed
to solve.

H$\alpha$ imaging spectroscopy observation by the Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager

high-dimensional classification, which first adopts different filtering methods
to produce multiple tasks and then modifies a competitive swarm optimizer to
efficiently solve these related tasks via knowledge transfer. First, a
diversified multiple task generation method is designed based on multiple
filtering methods, which generates several relevant low-dimensional FS tasks by
eliminating irrelevant features. In this way, useful knowledge for solving
simple and relevant tasks can be transferred to simplify and speed up the
solution of the original high-dimensional FS task. Then, a competitive swarm

challenging in visual Reinforcement Learning (RL). Existing approaches try to
acquire a robust representation via diversifying the appearances of in-domain

the environment, these methods ignore the possibility of exploring diverse
real-world image datasets. In this paper, we investigate how a visual RL agent
would benefit from the off-the-shelf visual representations. Surprisingly, we
find that the early layers in an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet model could
provide rather generalizable representations for visual RL. Hence, we propose
Pre-trained Image Encoder for Generalizable visual reinforcement learning
(PIE-G), a simple yet effective framework that can generalize to the unseen
visual scenarios in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on
DMControl Generalization Benchmark, DMControl Manipulation Tasks, Drawer World,

PIE-G improves sample efficiency and significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization performance. In particular,
PIE-G boasts a 55% generalization performance gain on average in the

estimated depth information derived from the rich intermediate representations

framework using internal representations of diffusion models. Subsequently, we
propose the incorporation of two guidance techniques based on pseudo-labeling

the generated image using the estimated depth map. Experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in

current network-centric systems in providing high-rate ubiquitous transmission.
The capability of providing uniform service level makes CF mMIMO a potential
technology for beyond-5G and 6G networks. The acquisition of accurate Channel
State Information (CSI) is critical for different CF mMIMO operations. Hence,
an uplink pilot training phase is used to efficiently estimate transmission
channels. The number of available orthogonal pilot signals is limited, and
reusing these pilots will increase co-pilot interference. This causes an
undesirable effect known as pilot contamination that could reduce the system
performance. Hence, a proper pilot reuse strategy is needed to mitigate the
effects of pilot contamination. In this paper, we formulate pilot assignment in
CF mMIMO as a diverse clustering problem and propose an iterative maxima search
scheme to solve it. In this approach, we first form the clusters of User
Equipments (UEs) so that the intra-cluster diversity maximizes and then assign
the same pilots for all UEs in the same cluster. The numerical results show the

population on each layer plays a different game, with layer I preferring the
opposite strategy to layer II. We measure the difference between the two games

loops. They often emerge as a result of unstable growth processes, in which
growing branches compete for the available flux. This leads to effective
repulsion between the branches and screening of the shorter ones. Although this
classical picture easily produces branched structures, it does not capture
attraction between the branches leading to the emergence of reticulated
networks. We show that a striking transition from repulsive to attractive
interactions between the branches takes place as the leading branch reaches the
boundary of the system. The shorter branches revive then and grow toward the
leading one forming loops, which changes the topology of the growing network.

the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE), we aim
to provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the morphology of
galaxy halos and of their mass distributions with a focus on the snapshot at
redshift $z=0.5$. We developed an iterative strategy involving a principal
component analysis (PCA) to investigate the properties of the EAGLE halos and
the differences in alignment between the various components. The mass
distributions of the dark-matter (DM), gas, and star halos are characterised by
a half-mass radius, a concentration parameter and (projected) axis ratios. We
present statistics of the shape parameters of 336\,540 halos from the EAGLE
RefL0025N0376 simulation and describe their evolution from redshift $z=15$ to
$z=0$. We measured the three-dimensional and two-dimensional projected shape
parameters for the DM, the gas, and the star components as well as for all
particles. At $z=0.5$, the minor axis of gas aligns with the minor axis of DM
for massive halos ($M>10^{12}$ M$_\odot$), but this alignment is poorer for
less massive halos. The DM halos axis ratios $b/a$ and $c/a$ have median values
of $0.82 \pm 0.11$ and $0.64 \pm 0.12$, respectively. The sphericity of gas in
halos w/ and w/o stars appears to be negatively correlated to the total mass,
while the sphericity of DM is insensitive to it. The measured projected axis
ratios, $b_p/a_p$, of star halos at $z=0.5$ have a median value of $0.80 \pm
0.07$, which is in good agreement with ground-based and space-based
measurements within 1 $\sigma$. For DM halos, we measure a value of $0.85 \pm
0.06$.

and widely studied. However, lots of the studies related to neutron stars
require precise determination of their distances and proper motions. This
thesis focuses on high-precision astrometry of neutron stars using the data
from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the Gaia space telescope
operating, respectively, at radio and optical frequencies. The neutron stars
studied in the thesis include the extremely magnetized magnetars, the
fast-spinning millisecond pulsars, the gravitational-wave-emitting double
neutron stars and neutron star X-ray binaries. As a major accomplishment, this
thesis presents the novel analysis and the results of the MSPSRpi project --
the largest astrometric survey of millisecond pulsars, then point out the
abundant implications of the astrometric results. Additionally, the release of
the astrometric results is bound to facilitate the detection of an
ultra-low-frequency gravitational-wave background. Methodologically, this
thesis applied advanced VLBI techniques to pulsar astrometry using the original
data reduction pipeline psrvlbireduce, which leads to the first two significant
magnetar parallaxes, and paves the way for studying magnetar formation channels
with their velocity distribution. The astrometry Bayesian inference package
sterne, developed during the PhD program, serves as a versatile and powerful
tool for the inference of astrometric parameters.

question is determining those conjunctive queries (CQs) for which this problem
can be solved in guaranteed PTIME. We shed new light on this and the related
problem of causal responsibility by proposing a unified Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) formulation. It is unified in that it can solve both prior
studied restrictions (e.g., self-join-free CQs under set semantics that allow a
PTIME solution) and new cases (e.g., all CQs under set or bag semantics It is
also unified in that all queries and all instances are treated with the same
approach, and the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in PTIME for the easy
cases. We prove that, for all easy self-join-free CQs, the Linear Programming
(LP) relaxation of our encoding is identical to the ILP solution and thus
standard ILP solvers are guaranteed to return the solution in PTIME. Our
approach opens up the door to new variants and new fine-grained analysis: 1) It
also works under bag semantics and we give the first dichotomy result for bags
semantics in the problem space. 2) We give a more fine-grained analysis of the
complexity of causal responsibility. 3) We recover easy instances for generally
hard queries, such as instances with read-once provenance and instances that
become easy because of Functional Dependencies in the data. 4) We solve an open
conjecture from PODS 2020. 5) Experiments confirm that our results indeed
predict the asymptotic running times, and that our universal ILP encoding is at
times even faster to solve for the PTIME cases than a prior proposed dedicated

framework that provides safety certification to an arbitrary controller applied
to an uncertain nonlinear control system. The proposed RPOF-SF combines a
robustly stable observer that estimates the system state from noisy measurement
data and a predictive safety filter that renders an arbitrary controller safe
by (possibly) minimally modifying the controller input to guarantee safety. We
show in theory that the proposed RPOF-SF guarantees constraint satisfaction
despite disturbances applied to the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed RPOF-SF algorithm using an uncertain mass-spring-damper system.

method for estimating the number of degrees of freedom (NDoF) of the scattered

study the relationship between NDoF and scatterer contrast by modifying the
radiation matrix. Specifically, three numerical methods for calculating the
NDoF are presented. The first NDoF is defined as the number of principle
singular values of the external radiation matrix, which is used as a benchmark.
The second NDoF is defined based on the modified radiation matrix that
incorporates the contrast of domain of investigation (DoI) with the external
radiation matrix. By exploring the relationship between the second NDoF and
contrast, an approximate upper bound of the second NDoF is obtained, that is,
the third NDoF. The accuracy of the proposed NDoF is verified by interpolation
experiments on both synthetic and experimental data using frequency-domain
zero-padding method. Results show that the second NDoF is more accurate than
traditional NDoF for high-contrast scatterers, and the third NDoF can be easily
estimated by the traditional NDoF plus a positive constant, which provides a
simple way to estimate the upper bound of NDoF.

  Uncertainties in DUNE",,,,,"hep-ex physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Muons have a similar latency/energy correlation from pion decay as do the
neutrinos, and hence in each time-slice in a stroboscopic analysis measurements
of their momentum spectra can reduce systematic uncertainties due to flux.
There are, however, unique issues for muons: 1) during standard neutrino
data-taking muon measurements in the forward direction must be in formidable
high-flux high-radiation environments; 2) because of the very high incident
hadron flux in the Absorber Hall, muons must be detected after a thick
absorber, imposing a range cutoff at a momentum much above the minimum neutrino
momentum of interest; 3) the muon velocity, unlike that of neutrinos, differs
from $c$, and so the muon detected time will require correction for the muon
flight path, requiring measurement of the muon momentum; 4) multiple scattering
is significant for low-momentum muons, and so a `good geometry' is essential
for precision muon flux measurements; and 5) developments in psec timing allow
muon momenta in the momentum region of interest to be measured precisely by
time-of-flight over short distances with photodetectors of a few-psec
resolution. Here we advocate that a program of extensive precise low-intensity
muon momentum spectrum measurements be carried out early in the LBNF program
before the Absorber Hall becomes too hot. The low-momentum muon spectra taken
in this experiment would be cross-normalized to the high-intensity neutrino
data through the currently planned muon monitors which can operate in both the
low and high intensity geometries.
  While beyond the scope of uniquely muon-related issues, the note includes a
proposal for an long-base-line oscillation analysis strategy that exploits
stroboscopic information for both neutrinos and muons to reduce systematic
uncertainties on the neutrino fluxes and event selection in Far and Near
detectors.

segmenting the target according to the given language expression, has drawn
increasing attention. Existing methods jointly consider the localization and
segmentation steps, which rely on the fused visual and linguistic features for
both steps. We argue that the conflict between the purpose of identifying an
object and generating a mask limits the RES performance. To solve this problem,
we propose a parallel position-kernel-segmentation pipeline to better isolate
and then interact the localization and segmentation steps. In our pipeline,
linguistic information will not directly contaminate the visual feature for
segmentation. Specifically, the localization step localizes the target object
in the image based on the referring expression, and then the visual kernel
obtained from the localization step guides the segmentation step. This pipeline
also enables us to train RES in a weakly-supervised way, where the pixel-level
segmentation labels are replaced by click annotations on center and corner
points. The position head is fully-supervised and trained with the click
annotations as supervision, and the segmentation head is trained with
weakly-supervised segmentation losses. To validate our framework on a
weakly-supervised setting, we annotated three RES benchmark datasets (RefCOCO,
RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg) with click annotations.Our method is simple but
surprisingly effective, outperforming all previous state-of-the-art RES methods

examine the trade-off between model performance and interpretability across a
broad range of science and engineering problems with an emphasis on materials
science datasets. We compare the performance of black box random forest and
neural network machine learning algorithms to that of single-feature linear
regressions which are fitted using interpretable input features discovered by a
simple random search algorithm. For interpolation problems, the average
prediction errors of linear regressions were twice as high as those of black
box models. Remarkably, when prediction tasks required extrapolation, linear
models yielded average error only 5% higher than that of black box models, and
outperformed black box models in roughly 40% of the tested prediction tasks,
which suggests that they may be desirable over complex algorithms in many
extrapolation problems because of their superior interpretability,

approximation used. These studies are unable to explain the main experimental
results, c-BN is stable, the relative stability order and the large energy
difference between h-BN and c-BN (greater than 150 meV/formula unit). In this
study, we introduce contributions from electron-phonon interactions (EPI) to
the total energy of BN polymorphs. This clearly establishes c-BN is the stable

is strongly sensitive to chemical bonding (approximately twice in $sp^2$-bonded

  Diverse Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.LG cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The percolation threshold is an important measure to determine the inherent
rigidity of large networks. Predictors of the percolation threshold for large
networks are computationally intense to run, hence it is a necessity to develop
predictors of the percolation threshold of networks, that do not rely on
numerical simulations. We demonstrate the efficacy of five machine
learning-based regression techniques for the accurate prediction of the
percolation threshold. The dataset generated to train the machine learning
models contains a total of 777 real and synthetic networks. It consists of 5
statistical and structural properties of networks as features and the
numerically computed percolation threshold as the output attribute. We
establish that the machine learning models outperform three existing empirical
estimators of bond percolation threshold, and extend this experiment to predict
site and explosive percolation. Further, we compared the performance of our
models in predicting the percolation threshold using RMSE values. The gradient
boosting regressor, multilayer perceptron and random forests regression models
achieve the least RMSE values among considered models.

  developmental disabilities","Master of Science Thesis",,,,"cs.HC cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Social robots, also known as service or assistant robots, have been developed
to improve the quality of human life in recent years. Socially assistive robots
(SAR) are a special type of social robots that focus on providing support
through social interaction. The design of socially capable and intelligent
robots can vary, depending on the target user groups. In this work, I assess
the effect of socially assistive robots' roles, functions, and communication
approaches in the context of a social agent providing service or companionship
to users with developmental disabilities. In this thesis, I describe an
exploratory study of interaction design for a socially assistive robot that
supports people suffering from developmental disabilities. While exploring the
impacts of visual elements to robot's visual interface and different aspects of
robot's social dimension, I developed a series of prototypes and tested them
through three user studies that included three residents with various function
levels at a local group home for people with developmental disabilities. All
user studies had been recorded for the following qualitative data analysis.
Results show that each design factor played a different role in delivering
information and in increasing engagement, and there are more aspects of HRI to
consider besides robot's graphical user interface and speech, such as proxemics
and robot's physical appearance and dimensions. I also note that some
fundamental design principles that would work for ordinary users did not apply
to our target user group. I conclude that socially assistive robots could
benefit our target users and acknowledge that these robots were not suitable
for certain scenarios based on the feedback from our users.

applications as they cover large regions with high density. However, they are
not accurate in the sense that they do not agree with ground-based
measurements. An established means for improving their accuracy is to correct
them by adopting machine learning algorithms. This correction takes the form of
a regression problem, in which the ground-based measurements have the role of
the dependent variable and the satellite data are the predictor variables,
together with topography factors (e.g., elevation). Most studies of this kind
involve a limited number of machine learning algorithms, and are conducted for
a small region and for a limited time period. Thus, the results obtained
through them are of local importance and do not provide more general guidance
and best practices. To provide results that are generalizable and to contribute
to the delivery of best practices, we here compare eight state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms in correcting satellite precipitation data for the
entire contiguous United States and for a 15-year period. We use monthly data
from the PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information
using Artificial Neural Networks) gridded dataset, together with monthly
earth-observed precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology
Network monthly database, version 2 (GHCNm). The results suggest that extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forests are the most accurate in terms
of the squared error scoring function. The remaining algorithms can be ordered
as follows from the best to the worst: Bayesian regularized feed-forward neural
networks, multivariate adaptive polynomial splines (poly-MARS), gradient
boosting machines (gbm), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS),
feed-forward neural networks, linear regression.

  Benchmarks","Accepted to ISCA 2023",,,,"cs.DC cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building large AI fleets to support the rapidly growing DL workloads is an
active research topic for modern cloud providers. Generating accurate
benchmarks plays an essential role in designing the fast-paced software and
hardware solutions in this space. Two fundamental challenges to make this
scalable are (i) workload representativeness and (ii) the ability to quickly
incorporate changes to the fleet into the benchmarks.
  To overcome these issues, we propose Mystique, an accurate and scalable
framework for production AI benchmark generation. It leverages the PyTorch
execution trace (ET), a new feature that captures the runtime information of AI
models at the granularity of operators, in a graph format, together with their
metadata. By sourcing fleet ETs, we can build AI benchmarks that are portable
and representative. Mystique is scalable, due to its lightweight data
collection, in terms of runtime overhead and instrumentation effort. It is also
adaptive because ET composability allows flexible control on benchmark
creation.
  We evaluate our methodology on several production AI models, and show that
benchmarks generated with Mystique closely resemble original AI models, both in
execution time and system-level metrics. We also showcase the portability of
the generated benchmarks across platforms, and demonstrate several use cases
enabled by the fine-grained composability of the execution trace.

water (PAW) is reported. To produce PAW in a batch and continuous manner a
multiple plasma device setup is used. The multiple plasma device consists of a
series of plasma devices that are powered simultaneously to produce PAW. This
multiple plasma device is powered by indigenously developed high-voltage
high-frequency power supply. The air plasma generated in this multiple plasma
device setup is electrically characterized and the produced radicals/species
are identified using optical emission spectroscopy. The post-discharge effluent
gases left after plasma-water exposure carries some environmental pollutants
(NOx and O3, etc.). The batch and continuous PAW production setup utilizes
effluent (pollutants) gases in production of large volume PAW. Hence, it
substantially reduces the concentration of these pollutants in effluent gases
which are released in environment. The batch process produces high reactive PAW
with less volume (2 liters). Moreover, in a continuous process, a high volume
(20 liters) with low reactivity of PAW is produced. The high reactive PAW and
low reactive PAW are used for different applications. Inactivation of microbes
(bacteria, fungi, viruses, and pests), food preservation, selective killing of
cells, etc. is carried out using high reactive PAW whereas low reactive PAW has
applications in seeds germination, plant growth, and as a nitrogen source for
agriculture and aquaculture applications, etc. In addition, the batch and
continuous PAW production setup designs are scalable, therefore, can be used in
industries for PAW production.

species (ROS) such as H2O2 and dissolved O3 in plasma-activated water (PAW) is
discussed. For selective ROS generation, pure CO2 was used as a plasma-forming
gas. The gases species present in plasma and properties of PAW are compared in
details when CO2 and air are used as plasma forming gas. The results reveal
that PAW (CO2) has significantly higher pH, and low oxidizing potential and
electrical conductivity compared to PAW (air). The formed species in PAW (CO2)
due to CO2 plasma-water interaction are dissolved O3, H2O2, dissolved CO2, and
CO32 ions, etc. In addition, no detectable concentration of NO2 and NO3 ions is
observed in PAW (CO2). PAW (CO2) has a substantially higher concentration of
H2O2 compared to PAW (air). Moreover, increasing plasma treatment time with
water significantly increases H2O2 and dissolved O3 concentration in PAW (CO2).
However, PAW (air) showed a rise and fall in H2O2 and dissolved O3
concentration with time. In conclusion, selective generation of ROS in PAW is
possible using CO2 as plasma-forming gas.

a plasma forming gas. The plasma is characterized electrically and
identification of generated species in plasma is carried out using optical
emission spectroscopy. The study clearly indicated that more oxidizing PAW
exhibits algicidal effect. The PAW treatment with both the algae species
substantially decreased their growth compared to control. Moreover, the
morphology of algae cells showed damage and cells structure get ruptured after
PAW treatment. In the second study, a less reactive PAW (low oxidizing
potential) used as a nitrogen replacement in Bolds Basal Medium. The PAW-grown
Chlorella Pyrenoidosa and Chlorella Sorokiniana showed higher growth compared
to control. Also, a higher concentration of chlorophyll a and b, sugar, and
protein observed compared to control. Further, we observed lower antioxidant
enzymatic activities in PAW-grown algae compared to control. In conclusion, the
PAW has algicidal efficacy as well as can be used as nitrogen source in
aquaculture to enhance algae growth.
