wired connectivity for control operation in robots and production modules.
Interference management techniques such as centralized power control can
improve spectral efficiency in dense deployments of such subnetworks. However,
existing solutions for centralized power control may require full channel state
information (CSI) of all the desired and interfering links, which may be
cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain in dense deployments. This paper
presents a novel solution for centralized power control for industrial
subnetworks based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The proposed method only
requires the subnetwork positioning information, usually known at the central
controller, and the knowledge of the desired link channel gain during the
execution phase. Simulation results show that our solution achieves similar
spectral efficiency as the benchmark schemes requiring full CSI in runtime
operations. Also, robustness to changes in the deployment density and
environment characteristics with respect to the training phase is verified.

Assuming non-targeted strains are unaffected by vaccination, we regard the
secondary outcome as a negative control outcome and show how using such data
can (i) increase the precision of the estimated vaccine efficacy against
targeted strains in randomized trials, and (ii) reduce confounding bias of that
same estimate in observational studies. For objective (i), we augment the
primary outcome estimating equation with a function of the secondary outcome
that is unbiased for zero. For objective (ii), we jointly estimate the
treatment effects on the primary and secondary outcomes. If the bias induced by
the unmeasured confounders is similar for both types of outcomes, as is
plausible for factors that influence the general risk of infection, then we can
use the estimated efficacy against the secondary outcomes to remove the bias
from estimated efficacy against the primary outcome. We demonstrate the utility
of these approaches in studies of HPV vaccines that only target a few highly
carcinogenic strains. In this example, using non-targeted strains increased
precision in randomized trials modestly but reduced bias in observational

aggregation of the local updates within the FL learning rounds at the UAVs are
governed by the reliability of the wireless channel. This creates an
undesirable bias towards the training data of ground devices with better

proposes a channel-aware distribution and aggregation scheme to enforce equal

allowed in Type-I two Higgs doublet model and can be produced in association
with neutral scalars for large parts of parameter space at the LHC. Such low
mass charged scalars typically have dominant decays to the fermionic modes viz.
$\tau\nu$ and $c s$. However in the presence of light neutral scalar
($\varphi$), the charged Higgs boson has a substantial branching fraction into
the bosonic decay modes $H^{\pm} \to W^{(*)} \varphi$. Identifying the heavier
neutral Higgs ($H$) with the observed 125 GeV Higgs and working in the limit
$M_{H^\pm} \approx M_A$, we examine charged Higgs production and decay in the
bosonic mode $p p \to H^\pm h \to W^{(*)}h h$. The presence of two light
Higgses ($h$) is then the key to identifying charged Higgs production. The
light Higgs branching ratio is largely dominated by the $b\bar{b}$ mode except
when close to the fermiophobic limit. Here, the rates into $b \bar b$ and
$\gamma \gamma$ can be comparable and we can use the $\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$
signature. This signature is complementary to the $h h \to 4\gamma$ which has
been previously discussed in literature. Using the lepton from the $W$ boson,
we demonstrate with a cut-and-count analysis that both the new light neutral

existing deep time series clustering approaches mostly seek to train the deep
neural network by some instance reconstruction based or cluster distribution
based objective, which, however, lack the ability to exploit the sample-wise
(or augmentation-wise) contrastive information or even the higher-level (e.g.,
cluster-level) contrastiveness for learning discriminative and
clustering-friendly representations. In light of this, this paper presents a
deep temporal contrastive clustering (DTCC) approach, which for the first time,
to our knowledge, incorporates the contrastive learning paradigm into the deep
time series clustering research. Specifically, with two parallel views
generated from the original time series and their augmentations, we utilize two
identical auto-encoders to learn the corresponding representations, and in the
meantime perform the cluster distribution learning by incorporating a k-means
objective. Further, two levels of contrastive learning are simultaneously
enforced to capture the instance-level and cluster-level contrastive
information, respectively. With the reconstruction loss of the auto-encoder,
the cluster distribution loss, and the two levels of contrastive losses jointly
optimized, the network architecture is trained in a self-supervised manner and
the clustering result can thereby be obtained. Experiments on a variety of time

difficult, with the research in this area largely limited to short-term
predictions. Though plagued with noise and stochasticity, videos consist of
features that are organised in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, different features
possessing different temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic
Latent Hierarchy (DLH) -- a deep hierarchical latent model that represents
videos as a hierarchy of latent states that evolve over separate and fluid
timescales. Each latent state is a mixture distribution with two components,
representing the immediate past and the predicted future, causing the model to
learn transitions only between sufficiently dissimilar states, while clustering
temporally persistent states closer together. Using this unique property, DLH
naturally discovers the spatiotemporal structure of a dataset and learns
disentangled representations across its hierarchy. We hypothesise that this
simplifies the task of modeling temporal dynamics of a video, improves the
learning of long-term dependencies, and reduces error accumulation. As
evidence, we demonstrate that DLH outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in
video prediction, is able to better represent stochasticity, as well as to
dynamically adjust its hierarchical and temporal structure. Our paper shows,

a high angular momentum of the heavy ions and provided experimental evidence
for vorticity in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) for the first time. In order to
investigate the underlying mechanisms, a dynamic description of the transfer of
angular momentum is required. In this work, the microscopic non-equilibrium
transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting

interaction of two nuclei. As SMASH provides access to the whole phase-space

of angular momentum generated in the fireball by all participants. We confirm
the previous modeling by Becattini \textit{et al} within a geometric Glauber

maximum in mid-central collisions during time evolution. The corresponding
impact parameter is around $b=4-6$ fm for all beam energies from $\sqrt{s_{\rm

allows capturing the interconnection of CIoT devices and training

domain-specific FL. In the case of domain-agnostic, it forces G-Fedfilt to act
similar to the conventional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) aggregation rule. The
proposed G-Fedfilt also enables an intrinsic smooth clustering based on the
graph connectivity without explicitly specified which further boosts the
personalization of the models in the framework. In addition, the proposed
scheme enjoys a communication-efficient time-scheduling to alleviate the system
heterogeneity. This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the amount of
training data samples and sparsity of the models' gradients to reduce
communication desynchronization and latency. Simulation results show that the

definition of Hilbert space fragmentation characterizing \emph{families} of
Hamiltonian systems based on their (generalized) symmetries. In this paper, we
reveal a simple connection between the aforementioned classification of
physical systems and their coherence generation properties, quantified by the
coherence generating power (CGP). The maximum CGP (in the basis associated to
the algebra of each family of Hamiltonians) is exactly related to the number of
independent Krylov subspaces $K$, which is precisely the characteristic used in
the classification of the system. In order to gain further insight, we
numerically simulate paradigmatic models with both ordinary symmetries and
Hilbert space fragmentation, comparing the behavior of the CGP in each case
with the system dimension. More generally, allowing the time evolution to be
any unitary channel in a specified algebra, we show analytically that the
scaling of the Haar averaged value of the CGP depends only on $K$. These
results illustrate the intuitive relationship between coherence generation and
symmetry algebras.

either make parametric assumptions and end up under-covering/over-rejecting
when these fail or use non-parametric but conservative concentration
inequalities and end up over-covering/under-rejecting. To circumvent these
issues, we sidestep exact at-least-$\alpha$ coverage and focus on
asymptotically exact coverage and asymptotic optimality. That is, we seek
sequential tests whose probability of ever rejecting a true hypothesis
asymptotically approaches $\alpha$ and whose expected time to reject a false
hypothesis approaches a lower bound on all tests with asymptotic coverage at
least $\alpha$, both under an appropriate asymptotic regime. We permit
observations to be both non-parametric and dependent and focus on testing
whether the observations form a martingale difference sequence. We propose the
universal sequential probability ratio test (uSPRT), a slight modification to
the normal-mixture sequential probability ratio test, where we add a burn-in
period and adjust thresholds accordingly. We show that even in this very
general setting, the uSPRT is asymptotically optimal under mild generic
conditions. We apply the results to stabilized estimating equations to test
means, treatment effects, etc. Our results also provide corresponding

influence age scaling in a network. We show that in a fully connected network,
a single infected node increases the expected age from $O(\log n)$ to $O(n)$.
Further, we show that the optimal behavior for an adversary is to reset the
timestamps of all outgoing packets to the current time and of all incoming
packets to an outdated time for the infected node; thereby preventing any fresh
information to go into the infected node, and facilitating acceptance of stale
information out of the infected node into other network nodes. Lastly for fully
connected network, we show that if an infected node contacts only a single node
instead of all nodes of the network, the system age can still be degraded to
$O(n)$. These show that fully connected nature of a network can be both a
benefit and a detriment for information freshness; full connectivity, while
enabling fast dissemination of information, also enables fast dissipation of
adversarial inputs. We then analyze the unidirectional ring network, the other
end of the network connectivity spectrum, where we show that the adversarial
effect on age scaling of a node is limited by its distance from the adversary,
and the age scaling for a large fraction of the network continues to be
$O(\sqrt{n})$, unchanged from the case with no adversary. We finally support
our findings with simulations.

for obtaining a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution for unweighted maximum
matching, it had been an open problem whether a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate MWM
can be obtained in $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon, \log n)$ rounds in the CONGEST

classes such as bipartite graphs [AKO18] and minor-free graphs [CS22]. For
general graphs, the previously known algorithms require exponential in
$(1/\epsilon)$ rounds for obtaining a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution
[FFK21] or achieve an approximation factor of at most 2/3 [AKO18]. In this
work, we settle this open problem by giving a deterministic
$\text{poly}(1/\epsilon, \log n)$-round algorithm for computing a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate MWM for general graphs in the CONGEST model. Our

implies a CREW PRAM algorithm with $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon, \log n)$ span using
only $O(m)$ processors. In addition, with the reduction from Gupta and Peng

circuits (VQCs) are currently one of the main strategies for building quantum
machine learning models. These models are made up of a quantum part and a
classical part. The quantum part is given by a parametrization $U$, which, in
general, is obtained from the product of different quantum gates. By its turn,
the classical part corresponds to an optimizer that updates the parameters of
$U$ in order to minimize a cost function $C$. However, despite the many
applications of VQCs, there are still questions to be answered, such as for
example: What is the best sequence of gates to be used? How to optimize their
parameters? Which cost function to use? How the architecture of the quantum
chips influences the final results? In this article, we focus on answering the
last question. We will show that, in general, the cost function will tend to a
typical average value the closer the parameterization used is from a
$2$-design. Therefore, the closer this parameterization is to a $2$-design, the
less the result of the quantum neural network model will depend on its
parametrization. As a consequence, we can use the own architecture of the
quantum chips to defined the VQC parametrization, avoiding the use of
additional swap gates and thus diminishing the VQC depth and the associated
errors.

understanding the storyline of a movie. However, accurately detecting movie
scenes is often challenging as it requires the ability to reason over very long

which are typically designed for short-range video analysis. This work proposes
a State-Space Transformer model that can efficiently capture dependencies in
long movie videos for accurate movie scene detection. Our model, dubbed
TranS4mer, is built using a novel S4A building block, which combines the
strengths of structured state-space sequence (S4) and self-attention (A)
layers. Given a sequence of frames divided into movie shots (uninterrupted
periods where the camera position does not change), the S4A block first applies
self-attention to capture short-range intra-shot dependencies. Afterward, the
state-space operation in the S4A block is used to aggregate long-range
inter-shot cues. The final TranS4mer model, which can be trained end-to-end, is
obtained by stacking the S4A blocks one after the other multiple times. Our
proposed TranS4mer outperforms all prior methods in three movie scene detection
datasets, including MovieNet, BBC, and OVSD, while also being $2\times$ faster
and requiring $3\times$ less GPU memory than standard Transformer models. We
will release our code and models.

be viewed as invariants or fingerprints of the gapless state. The emergent
symmetries can be anomaly-free (classified by groups or higher groups),
anomalous (classified by groups plus group cocycles), or even beyond group and
beyond anomalous. To understand all those emergent symmetries in an unified
way, it is better to put all the emergent symmetries of the state together, and
refer to the maximal emergent symmetry as maximal categorical symmetry. A
systematic understanding of those emergent symmetries is achieved after
realizing that categorical symmetry is nothing but (non-invertible)
gravitational anomaly, which is the same as topological order in one higher
dimension if the categorical symmetry is finite. The above description of
maximal categorical symmetry is just a vague idea. In this paper, we propose a
precise way to define the notion of maximal categorical symmetry. For example,
the 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal categorical symmetry described by
the 2+1D doulbe-Ising topological order. Such a categorical symmetry is not
associated to any anomaly-free symmetry. The maximal categorical symmetry is a
very detailed characterization of the gapless state (much more than the
projective symmetry group introduced before for the same purpose). It may be
close to the full characterization of the local low energy properties of
gapless liquid state. Therefore, the study of maximal categorical symmetry may
be a key to gaining a systematic understanding or even a classification of
gapless liquid states, up to local low energy equivalence, where two gapless
states are local low energy equivalent if they differ by stacking a gapped
state.

(2021) define a standard and regulatory framework for automotive cybersecurity.
Both documents follow a risk management-based approach and require a threat
modeling methodology for risk analysis and identification. Such a threat
modeling methodology must conform to the Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment
(TARA) framework of ISO/SAE 21434. Conversely, existing threat modeling methods
enumerate isolated threats disregarding the vehicle's design and connections.
Consequently, they neglect the role of attack paths from a vehicle's interfaces
to its assets. In other words, they are missing the TARA work products, e.g.,
attack paths compromising assets or feasibility and impact ratings. We propose
a threat modeling methodology to construct attack paths by identifying,
sequencing, and connecting vulnerabilities from a valid attack surface to an
asset. Initially, we transform cybersecurity guidelines to attack trees, and
then we use their formal interpretations to assess the vehicle's design. This
workflow yields compositional construction of attack paths along with the
required TARA work products (e.g., attack paths, feasibility, and impact). More
importantly, we can apply the workflow iteratively in the context of connected
vehicles to ensure design conformity, privacy, and cybersecurity. Finally, to
show the complexity and the importance of preemptive threat identification and
risk analysis in the automotive industry, we evaluate the presented model-based

fruit quality is its stage of ripening. This is usually manually classified by
field experts, making it a labor-intensive and error-prone process. Thus, there
is an arising need for automation in fruit ripeness classification. Many
automatic methods have been proposed that employ a variety of feature
descriptors for the food item to be graded. Machine learning and deep learning
techniques dominate the top-performing methods. Furthermore, deep learning can
operate on raw data and thus relieve the users from having to compute complex
engineered features, which are often crop-specific. In this survey, we review
the latest methods proposed in the literature to automatize fruit ripeness

2s2p6[3p] XUV-bright state to neighboring 2s2p6[3s] and 2s2p6[3d] XUV-dark
states. Controllable delays of one or both NIR pulses with respect to the
attosecond XUV pulse reveal the temporal evolution of either the dark or bright

measured to be 7 +/- 2 fs, 48 +/- 8 fs, and 427 +/- 40 fs, respectively, with
95% confidence. Accompanying calculations with two independent ab initio

support the expected trend that the autoionization lifetime should be longer

The underlying theory thus links the lifetime results to electron correlation

is a risk of performance degradation due to overfitting or when computational
resources are limited. During the feature selection process, the subset of
features that are most relevant and least redundant is chosen. In recent years,
it has become clear that, in addition to relevance and redundancy, features'
complementarity must be considered. Informally, if the features are weak
predictors of the target variable separately and strong predictors when
combined, then they are complementary. It is demonstrated in this paper that
the synergistic effect of complementary features mutually amplifying each other
in the construction of two-tier decision trees can be interfered with by
another feature, resulting in a decrease in performance. It is demonstrated
using cross-validation on both synthetic and real datasets, regression and
classification, that removing or eliminating the interfering feature can
improve performance by up to 24 times. It has also been discovered that the
lesser the domain is learned, the greater the increase in performance. More
formally, it is demonstrated that there is a statistically significant negative
rank correlation between performance on the dataset prior to the elimination of
the interfering feature and performance growth after the elimination of the
interfering feature. It is concluded that this broadens the scope of feature
selection methods for cases where data and computational resources are
sufficient.

Instead, we show that $N$ agents running policy mirror ascent converge to the

prove that conditional TD-learning in $N$-agent games can learn value functions

In a deterministic framework, the digraph of the templex connects cells within
a single complex for all time. Here, we introduce the stochastic version of a
templex. In a random templex, there is one complex per snapshot of the random
attractor and the digraph connects the generators or ``holes'' of successive

its holes in motion, namely their birth, splitting, merging, or death. This

Assuming this, it is problematic to explain how we can gain knowledge by
deducing a logical consequence implied in a set of known premises. To address
this problem, we offer an alternative account of the epistemic contribution of
deduction as the process required to deduce a conclusion or a theorem,
understanding such process not only in terms of the number of steps in the

we propose a novel affine-combining autoencoder (ACAE) method to perform
dimensionality reduction on the number of landmarks. The discovered latent 3D

sharing when used for consistency regularization. Our approach scales to an

external source and patient scatter and randoms are fully corrected. We
evaluated performance of sTX-MLAA compared to reference standard CT-based AC
with FDG PET/CT phantom studies; including modeling a patient with myocardial

this work, we consider a detailed modeling approach for a TI nanoribbon in
contact with a superconductor via its top surface, which induces a
superconducting gap in its surface-state spectrum. The system displays a rich
phase diagram with different numbers of end-localized MBSs as a function of
chemical potential and magnetic flux piercing the cross section of the ribbon.
These MBSs can be robust or fragile upon consideration of electrostatic
disorder. We simulate a tunneling spectroscopy setup to probe the different
topological phases of top-proximitized TI nanoribbons. Our simulation results
indicate that a top-proximitized TI nanoribbon is ideally suited for realizing
fully gapped topological superconductivity, in particular when the Fermi level
is pinned near the Dirac point. In this regime, the setup yields a single pair
of MBSs, well separated at opposite ends of the proximitized ribbon, which
gives rise to a robust quantized zero-bias conductance peak.

  Nonlinear Flow Velocity Dependence with Aggregates Concentration",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.mes-hall physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Efficient mixing and pumping of liquids at the microscale is a technology
that is still to be optimized. The combination of an AC electric field with a
small temperature gradient leads to a strong electro-thermal flow that can be
used for multiple purposes. Combining simulations and experiments, an analysis
of the performance of electro-thermal flow is provided when the temperature
gradient is generated by illuminating plasmonic nanoparticles in suspension
with a near-resonance focused laser. Fluid flow is measured by tracking the
velocity of fluorescent tracer microparticles in suspension as a function of
the electric field, laser power, and concentration of plasmonic particles.
Among other results, a non-linear relationship is found between the velocity of
the fluid and particle concentration, which is justified in terms of multiple
scattering-absorption events, involving aggregates and individual particles,
that lead to enhanced absorption when the concentration is raised. Simulations
provide a description of the phenomenon that is compatible with experiments and
constitute a way to understand and estimate the absorption and scattering
cross-sections of dispersed particles and/or aggregates. A comparison of
experiments and simulations suggests that the gold nanoparticles are aggregated
forming clusters of about 5-9 particles, but no information about their
structure cannot be obtained without further theoretical and experimental
developments. This nonlinear behavior could be useful to get very high ETP
velocities by inducing some controlled aggregation of the particles.

been subject of an extensive literature. However, this has mostly be focused on
the measures applicable in weakly interacting systems wherein they are
tractable via conventional methods. Recently it became possible to address such
dynamical quantum thermalization problems in very strongly interacting systems
using the holographic duality discovered in string theory, mapping the quantum
problem on a gravitational problem in one higher dimension, having as benefit
offering a more general view on how dissipation emerges from such intricate
quantum physical circumstances. We study here the elementary problem of a
single vortex in two space dimensions, set in motion by a sudden quench in the
background superflow formed in a finite density ""Reissner-Nordstrom""
holographic superconductor. This reveals a number of surprising outcomes
addressing questions of principle. By fitting the trajectories unambiguously to
the Hall-Vinen-Iordanskii phenomenological equation of motion we find that
these are characterized by a large inertial mass at low temperature that
however diminishes upon raising temperature. For a weak drive the drag is found
to increase when temperature is lowered which reveals a simple shear drag
associated with the viscous metallic vortex cores, supplemented by a
conventional normal fluid component at higher temperatures. For a strong drive
we discover a novel dynamical phenomenon: the core of the vortex deforms
accompanied by a large increase of the drag force.

individuals with different opinions interact and affect each other's opinions.
It is often difficult to quantitatively measure social opinions as empirical

takes the form of partial observations of the cumulative distribution function
of opinions. We prove that certain measurements guarantee a precise and unique

numerical results suggest that the error of the inferred interaction kernel

aptamer-based (E-AB) biosensors recently demonstrated their great potential for
in vivo continuous monitoring. Nevertheless, the detection accuracy is often
limited by the signaling drifts. Conventionally, these drifts are removed by
the kinetic differential measurements (KDM) when coupled with square-wave
voltammetry. Yet we discover that KDM does not apply to every aptamer as the
responses at different SWV frequencies heavily depend on its
structure-switching characteristics and the redox reporters' electron transfer
(ET) kinetics. To this end, we present a ""dual-aptamer"" scheme that uses two
aptamers responding differentially to the same molecular target for drift
cancellation. We identify these paired aptamers through (1) screening from the
existing aptamers pool and (2) engineering the signaling behavior of the redox
reporters. We demonstrate their differential signaling to ampicillin and ATP
molecules and show that the aptamer pair bears common drifts in undilute goat
serum. Through cancellation, sensor drift is reduced by 370-fold. Benefiting
from the ""differential"" signaling, the recording throughput is also doubled
using differential readout electronics. The authors believe the proposed
technique is beneficial for long-term in vivo monitoring.

differential transport of urea and hydrogen ion across the unilamellar vesicle
membrane periodically resets the pH clock that switches the system from acid to
basic, resulting in self-sustained oscillations. We analyse the structure of
the phase flow and of the limit cycle, which controls the dynamics for giant
vesicles and dominates the pronouncedly stochastic oscillations in small
vesicles of submicrometer size. To this end, we derive reduced models, which
are amenable to analytic treatments that are complemented by numerical
solutions, and obtain the period and amplitude of the oscillations as well as
the parameter domain, where oscillatory behavior persists. We show that the
accuracy of these predictions is highly sensitive to the employed reduction
scheme. In particular, we suggest an accurate two-variable model and show its
equivalence to a three-variable model that admits an interpretation in terms of
a chemical reaction network. The faithful modeling of a single pH oscillator

recovery) and 0.07% sensitivity; this is 1.5x resolution gain and 7x
sensitivity gain compared to a conventional dual head gamma camera. This work
presents improvement in imaging resolution by implementing a spatially variant
point spread function (SV-PSF) with list mode MLEM reconstruction. A resolution
recovery method by PSF deconvolution is validated on list mode MLEM
reconstruction for DC-SPECT. A spatial invariant PSF is included as an
additional test to show the influence of the accuracy of PSF modelling on the
reconstructed image quality. We compare the MLEM reconstruction with and
without PSF deconvolution; an analytic model is used for the calculation of
system response, and the results are compared to Monte Carlo (MC) based
methods. Results show that with PSF modelling applied, the quality of the
reconstructed image is improved, and the DC-SPECT system can achieve a 4.5 mm
central spatial resolution with average 795 counts/(s*Mbq). The results show
substantial improvement over the gold standard GE Discovery 570c performance
(spatial resolution 7 mm with an average 460 counts/s*MBq, central resolution
5.8 mm). The impact of PSF deconvolution is significant, and the improvements
of the reconstructed image quality is more evident compared to MC simulated
system matrix with the same sampling size as in simulation.

several combinations of TiX2 monolayers (X= Te, S and Se): TiTe2/TiSe2,
TiTe2/TiS2, and TiSe2/TiS2. Based on the observed orbital hybridization between
the different monolayers in these hetero-structures (HSs), we conclude that the
most significant Rashba splitting occurs in TiSe2/TiS2. Subsequently, we used
Fluorine (F) as an adatom over the surface of TiSe2/TiS2 at hollow and top
sites of the surface to enhance the Rashba intensity, as the F adatom induces
polarization due to difference in charge distribution. Furthermore, by
increasing the number of F atoms on the surface, we reinforced the band
splitting, i.e., we observe Rashba splitting accompanied by Zeeman splitting at
the valence-band edge states. Berry curvatures at K and K' with equal and
opposite nature confirms the existence of valley polarization. The
computationally observed properties suggest that these HSs are promising
candidates for spin-valley Hall effect devices and other spintronic

underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to
our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable

$\theta_i,\theta_j$ (which estimate the function values $f_0(x_i),f_0(x_j)$) at
all neighboring cells $i,j$ in the Voronoi diagram. This is seen to be
equivalent to a variational optimization problem that regularizes according to
the usual continuum (measure-theoretic) notion of TV, once we restrict the
domain to functions that are piecewise constant over the Voronoi diagram.
  The regression estimator under consideration hence performs (shrunken) local
averaging over adaptively formed unions of Voronoi cells, and we refer to it as

seek to understand the extent to which theoretical predictions of these
unsteady effects match numerical simulations. A potential-flow model derived
from a linear combination of the canonical Sears and Theodorsen problems is
proposed to capture the unsteady lift on a thin two-dimensional airfoil in the

the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 0012

frequencies, and quantify the amplitude and phase of the unsteady lift. Good
agreement with the model predictions is found even at relatively high reduced
frequencies, while minor deviations are observed when the angle-of-attack
amplitudes approach the static flow-separation regime of the airfoil.
Implications for model improvement and extensions are discussed for the cases
in which the ideal-flow theory proves insufficient. In sum, the theoretical

applications such as gust-load alleviation for increased robustness against
fatigue and the optimization of flapping flight in gusty environments for

high-dimensional data space results in slow inference speed, which restricts
their application in real-time systems. Previous works have explored speeding
up by minimizing the number of inference steps but at the cost of sample
quality. In this work, to improve the inference speed for DDPM-based TTS model
while achieving high sample quality, we propose ResGrad, a lightweight
diffusion model which learns to refine the output spectrogram of an existing
TTS model (e.g., FastSpeech 2) by predicting the residual between the model
output and the corresponding ground-truth speech. ResGrad has several
advantages: 1) Compare with other acceleration methods for DDPM which need to
synthesize speech from scratch, ResGrad reduces the complexity of task by
changing the generation target from ground-truth mel-spectrogram to the
residual, resulting into a more lightweight model and thus a smaller real-time
factor. 2) ResGrad is employed in the inference process of the existing TTS
model in a plug-and-play way, without re-training this model. We verify ResGrad
on the single-speaker dataset LJSpeech and two more challenging datasets with
multiple speakers (LibriTTS) and high sampling rate (VCTK). Experimental
results show that in comparison with other speed-up methods of DDPMs: 1)
ResGrad achieves better sample quality with the same inference speed measured
by real-time factor; 2) with similar speech quality, ResGrad synthesizes speech
faster than baseline methods by more than 10 times. Audio samples are available

Gen2,'' is one of the optical modules designed for future extensions of the
IceCube experiment at the South Pole. The D-Egg has an elongated-sphere shape
to maximize the photon-sensitive effective area while maintaining a narrow
diameter to reduce the cost and the time needed for drilling of the deployment
holes in the glacial ice for the optical modules at depths up to 2700 meters.
The D-Egg design is utilized for the IceCube Upgrade, the next stage of the
IceCube project also known as IceCube-Gen2 Phase 1, where nearly half of the
optical sensors to be deployed are D-Eggs. With two 8-inch high-quantum
efficiency photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) per module, D-Eggs offer an increased
effective area while retaining the successful design of the IceCube digital
optical module (DOM). The convolution of the wavelength-dependent effective
area and the Cherenkov emission spectrum provides an effective photodetection
sensitivity that is 2.8 times larger than that of IceCube DOMs. The signal of
each of the two PMTs is digitized using ultra-low-power 14-bit
analog-to-digital converters with a sampling frequency of 240 MSPS, enabling a
flexible event triggering, as well as seamless and lossless event recording of
single-photon signals to multi-photons exceeding 200 photoelectrons within 10
nanoseconds. Mass production of D-Eggs has been completed, with 277 out of the
310 D-Eggs produced to be used in the IceCube Upgrade. In this paper, we report
the des\ ign of the D-Eggs, as well as the sensitivity and the single to
multi-photon detection performance of mass-produced D-Eggs measured in a
laboratory using the built-in data acquisition system in each D-Egg optical
sensor module.

  Multi-Marginal Optimal Transport",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We study the problem of estimating latent population flows from aggregated
count data. This problem arises when individual trajectories are not available
due to privacy issues or measurement fidelity. Instead, the aggregated
observations are measured over discrete-time points, for estimating the
population flows among states. Most related studies tackle the problems by
learning the transition parameters of a time-homogeneous Markov process.
Nonetheless, most real-world population flows can be influenced by various
uncertainties such as traffic jam and weather conditions. Thus, in many cases,
a time-homogeneous Markov model is a poor approximation of the much more
complex population flows. To circumvent this difficulty, we resort to a
multi-marginal optimal transport (MOT) formulation that can naturally represent
aggregated observations with constrained marginals, and encode time-dependent
transition matrices by the cost functions. In particular, we propose to
estimate the transition flows from aggregated data by learning the cost
functions of the MOT framework, which enables us to capture time-varying
dynamic patterns. The experiments demonstrate the improved accuracy of the
proposed algorithms than the related methods in estimating several real-world
transition flows.

meta-reinforcement learning (RL) setting where an agent is presented with a
sequence of related tasks with limited interactions per task. The agent can use
its experience in each task and across tasks to estimate both the transition
model and the distribution over tasks. We propose an algorithm to meta-learn
the underlying structure across tasks, utilize it to plan in each task, and
upper-bound the regret of the planning loss. Our bound suggests that the

tasks are more similar. In the classical single-task setting, it is known that
the planning horizon should depend on the estimated model's accuracy, that is,
on the number of samples within task. We generalize this finding to meta-RL and
study this dependence of planning horizons on the number of tasks. Based on our
theoretical findings, we derive heuristics for selecting slowly increasing

obtained from $ \mathbf{X} $ by resampling $ k $ randomly chosen entries of $

method that explicitly learns relationships between data at different, known
scales throughout the pretraining process. Scale-MAE pretrains a network by
masking an input image at a known input scale, where the area of the Earth
covered by the image determines the scale of the ViT positional encoding, not
the image resolution. Scale-MAE encodes the masked image with a standard ViT
backbone, and then decodes the masked image through a bandpass filter to
reconstruct low/high frequency images at lower/higher scales. We find that
tasking the network with reconstructing both low/high frequency images leads to
robust multiscale representations for remote sensing imagery. Scale-MAE
achieves an average of a $2.4 - 5.6\%$ non-parametric kNN classification

domains is a fundamental building block for future quantum networks. A
promising way to bridge these widely different frequencies is using
high-frequency nanomechanical resonators interacting with low-loss optical
modes. State-of-the-art optomechanical devices require a relatively large
photon population in the cavity to enhance the acousto-optic coupling, the heat
arising from undesirable optical absorption, however, generates thermal phonons
that ultimately hinder their operation in the quantum regime. One way to
overcome this problem is by using dissipative optomechanics. In this framework,
photons can be scattered directly from a waveguide into a resonator, reducing
the need for a large intra-cavity photon population. Hitherto, such dissipative
optomechanical interaction was only demonstrated at low mechanical frequencies,
precluding the quantum state transfer between photonic and phononic domains.
Here, we show the first dissipative optomechanical system operating in the
sideband-resolved regime, where the mechanical frequency is larger than the
optical linewidth. Exploring this unprecedented regime, we demonstrate the
impact of dissipative optomechanical coupling in reshaping both mechanical and
optical spectra. Our figures represent a two-order-of-magnitude leap in the
mechanical frequency and a tenfold increase in the dissipative optomechanical
coupling rate compared to previous works. The present demonstration opens a
path to strongly dissipative optomechanical devices with nearly noiseless
operation in the quantum regime.

analysis. An orthogonality relation for characters of finite abelian groups
(now recognized as an orthogonality relation on GL(1)) was used by Dirichlet to
prove infinitely many primes in arithmetic progressions. Asymptotic
orthogonality relations for GL$(n)$, with $n\le 3$, and applications to number
theory, have been considered by various researchers. Recently, the authors of
the present work have derived an explicit asymptotic orthogonality relation,
with a power savings error term, for GL$(4,\mathbb R)$. Here we we extend those
results to GL$(n,\mathbb R)$ $(n\ge2)$.
  For $n\le 5$, our results are unconditional. In particular, the case $n=5$
represents a new result. The key new ingredient for the proof of the case $n=5$
is the theorem of Kim-Shahidi that functorial products of cusp forms on
GL(2)$\times$ GL(3) are automorphic on GL(6). For $n>5$, our results are
conditional on two conjectures, both of which have been verified in various
special cases. The first of these conjectures regards lower bounds for
Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and the second concerns recurrence relations for
Mellin transforms of GL$(n,\mathbb R)$ Whittaker functions.

low-dimensional representations of nodes across network layers. However, the
number of edges among layers may vary significantly. This data imbalance will
lead to performance degradation especially on the sparse layer due to learning
bias and the adverse effects of irrelevant or conflicting data in other layers.
In this paper, a Layer Imbalance Aware Multiplex Network Embedding (LIAMNE)
method is proposed where the edges in auxiliary layers are under-sampled based
on the node similarity in the embedding space of the target layer to achieve
balanced edge distribution and to minimize noisy relations that are less
relevant to the target layer. Real-world datasets with different degrees of
layer imbalance are used for experimentation. The results demonstrate that
LIAMNE significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art multiplex network
embedding methods in link prediction on the target layer. Meantime, the
comprehensive representation of the entire multiplex network is not compromised
by the sampling method as evaluated by its performance on the node

In this framework, multiple instances of the same problem, differing from each

solved efficiently online. To do that, one may rely on an initial preprocessing
phase for computing some useful information. This preprocessing phase makes it
possible, in some cases, to overcome locality-based time lower bounds.
  A first contribution of the current paper is expanding the spectrum of
problem types to which the SUPPORTED model applies. In addition to
subnetwork-defined recurrent problems, we introduce also recurrent problems of
two additional types: (i) instances defined by partial client sets, and (ii)
instances defined by partially fixed outputs.
  Our second contribution is illustrating the versatility of the SUPPORTED
framework by examining recurrent variants of three classical graph problems.
The first problem is Minimum Client Dominating Set (CDS), a recurrent version
of the classical dominating set problem with each recurrent instance requiring
us to dominate a partial client set. We provide a constant time approximation
scheme for CDS on trees and planar graphs.
  The second problem is Color Completion (CC), a recurrent version of the
coloring problem in which each recurrent instance comes with a partially fixed
coloring (of some of the vertices) that must be completed. We study the minimum
number of new colors and the minimum total number of colors necessary for
completing this task.
  The third problem we study is a recurrent version of Locally Checkable
Labellings (LCL) on paths of length $n$. We show that such problems have
complexities that are either $\Theta(1)$ or $\Theta(n)$, extending the results
of Foerster et al. [INFOCOM'19].

interatomic potentials of multi-element chemical systems. The potential energy
surface of a multi-element system is represented as a many-body expansion of
parametrized potentials which are functions of atom positions, atom types, and
parameters. The Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion is employed to decompose the
parametrized potentials into a set of orthogonal basis functions. The
orthogonal basis functions are used to construct proper orthogonal descriptors
based on the elements of atoms, thus leading to multi-element descriptors. For
a system of $N_{\rm e}$ elements, the number of multi-element proper orthogonal
descriptors increases as $O(N_{\rm e}^3)$, while the computational cost is
independent of $N_{\rm e}$. We compose the multi-element proper orthogonal
descriptors to develop two different interatomic potentials. The first
potential expresses the energy of each atom as a linear combination of proper
orthogonal descriptors, while the second potential expresses the energy as a
linear and quadratic combination of the descriptors. The second potential is
shown to provide a significant increase in accuracy relative to the first
potential, while having the same computational complexity as the first
potential. The proposed potentials are demonstrated for indium phosphide and
titanium dioxide in comparison with the spectral neighbor analysis potential

condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Classical
approaches use supervised learning where a classifier is trained on labeled
data to predict or classify different operational states of the machine.
However, in most industrial applications, labeled data is limited in terms of
its size and type. Hence, it cannot serve the training purpose. In this paper,
this problem is tackled by addressing the classification task as a similarity
measure to a reference sample rather than a supervised classification task.
Similarity-based approaches require a limited amount of labeled data and hence,
meet the requirements of real-world industrial applications. Accordingly, the
paper introduces a similarity-based framework for predictive maintenance (PdM)
of rotating machinery. For each operational state of the machine, a reference
vibration signal is generated and labeled according to the machine's
operational condition. Consequentially, statistical time analysis, fast Fourier
transform (FFT), and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) are used to extract
features from the captured vibration signals. For each feature type, three
similarity metrics, namely structural similarity measure (SSM), cosine
similarity, and Euclidean distance are used to measure the similarity between
test signals and reference signals in the feature space. Hence, nine settings
in terms of feature type-similarity measure combinations are evaluated.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of similarity-based approaches
in achieving very high accuracy with moderate computational requirements
compared to machine learning (ML)-based methods. Further, the results indicate
that using FFT features with cosine similarity would lead to better performance
compared to the other settings.

multiplet to the $W$-boson mass arises at one-loop level, which can be
expressed in terms of the electroweak (EW) oblique parameters $T$ and $S$ at
leading order. We firstly rederive the general formulae of $T$ and $S$ induced
by a scalar multiplet of EW charges, confirming the results in the literature.
We then study several specific examples of great phenomenological interest by
applying these general expressions. As a result, it is found that the model
with a scalar multiplet in an $SU(2)_L$ real representation with $Y=0$ cannot
generate the required $M_W$ correction since it leads to vanishing values of
$T$ and $S$. On the other hand, the cases with scalars in a complex
representation under $SU(2)_L$ with a general hypercharge can explain the $M_W$
excess observed by CDF-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} due to nonzero
$T$ and $S$. We further take into account of the strong constraints from the
perturbativity and the EW global fit of the precision data, and vary the
isospin representation and hypercharge of the additional scalar multiplet, in
order to assess the extent of the model to solve the $W$-boson mass anomaly. It
turns out that these constraints play important roles in setting limits on the

decompositions, to extract patterns over multiple modes. Second, we implement a
tensor completion algorithm using canonical polyadic tensor decomposition to
predict spatiotemporal data from multiple spatial sources and to identify
Covid-19 hotspots. We apply a regularized iterative tensor completion technique
with a practical regularization parameter estimator to predict the spread of
Covid-19 cases and to find and identify hotspots. Our method can predict weekly

data in the US using a novel sampling method for alternating least-squares.
Moreover, we compare the algorithms with standard tensor decompositions in
terms of their interpretability, visualization and cost analysis. Finally, we
demonstrate the efficacy of the methods by applying the techniques to New
Jersey's Covid-19 data.

applications. The task is often divided into sub-problems - generating cropping
candidates, finding the visually important regions, and determining aesthetics
to select the most appealing candidate. Prior approaches model one or more of
these sub-problems separately, and often combine them sequentially. We propose
a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to crop images
directly, without explicitly modeling image aesthetics, evaluating multiple
crop candidates, or detecting visually salient regions. Our model is trained on
a large dataset of images cropped by experienced editors and can simultaneously
predict bounding boxes for multiple fixed aspect ratios. We consider the aspect
ratio of the cropped image to be a critical factor that influences aesthetics.
Prior approaches for automatic image cropping, did not enforce the aspect ratio
of the outputs, likely due to a lack of datasets for this task. We, therefore,
benchmark our method on public datasets for two related tasks - first,
aesthetic image cropping without regard to aspect ratio, and second, thumbnail
generation that requires fixed aspect ratio outputs, but where aesthetics are
not crucial. We show that our strategy is competitive with or performs better
than existing methods in both these tasks. Furthermore, our one-stage model is
easier to train and significantly faster than existing two-stage or end-to-end
methods for inference. We present a qualitative evaluation study, and find that
our model is able to generalize to diverse images from unseen datasets and
often retains compositional properties of the original images after cropping.
Our results demonstrate that explicitly modeling image aesthetics or visual
attention regions is not necessarily required to build a competitive image
cropping algorithm.

agreeing that the quantization only slightly worsens the multiplicative factor.
Besides, we study compressed sensing where both covariate (i.e., sensing
vector) and response are quantized. Under covariate quantization, although our
recovery program is non-convex because the covariance matrix estimator lacks
positive semi-definiteness, all local minimizers are proved to enjoy near

such as dark energy and dark matter. As a theory of gravitation that govern
major dynamics on the large scale of the universe, an $ f(R)$ model should be
able to explain the transition from a matter-dominated universe to a
dark-energy-dominated universe. Assuming that the density parameter of the
radiation can be neglected during the transition from a matter-dominated
universe to a dark-energy-dominated universe, we find some fixed points
regarding the dynamical stability of the density parameters of the model. The
phase transition can be achieved if the $f(R)$ model can connect the fixed
point $P_5$ (representing the matter-dominated era) to the fixed point $P_1$
(representing the dark energy-dominated era). The method to evaluate that state
transition is called the Fixed-point analysis. In this study, we analyze the
viability of $f(R)$ models proposed by Starobinsky, Hu-Sawicki, and
Gogoi-Goswami regarding the phase transition from a matter-dominated universe
to a dark-energy-dominated universe. It is shown that those models are viable
by choosing some set of appropriate parameters. For example, in the Starobinsky
and Hu-Sawicki models, the parameter $\mu$ can be chosen to correspond to the
lower bound of $x_d= R_1/Rc$, where $R_1$ represents the de-Sitter point.
Meanwhile, for the Gogoi-Guswami model, the same results can be achieved by
taking $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters satisfying the existence and stability
conditions for the de-Sitter point. From these results, it can be concluded
that those $f(R)$ models allow such phase transitions of the universe to
realize the late-time accelerated expansion.

signals in rare variants through a hierarchical layer leveraging contexts of

non-trivial preparation contextuality. In two party-two measurement per
party-two outcomes per measurement $(2-2-2)$ Bell scenario, any argument of
Bell nonlocality is a proof of trivial preparation contextuality; however, the
converse may not hold. If one of the parties (say, Alice) performs the
measurements of more than two dichotomic observables, then it is possible to
find a set of non-trivial functional relations between Alice's observables. We
argue that the existence of a suitable set of such non-trivial relations
between Alice's observables may warrant the unsteerability of quantum states at
the end of another spatially separated party (say, Bob). Interestingly, such
constraints can be read as non-trivial preparation non-contextuality
assumptions in an ontological model. We further demonstrate two types of Bell
inequalities that can be converted into linear steering inequalities using the
aforementioned non-trivial conditions on Alice's observables. Such steering
inequalities can also be considered as non-trivial preparation noncontextual
inequalities. Since the local bound of the family of Bell expression gets
reduced under the additional non-trivial conditions, it provides a test of
quantum steering and nonlocality from the same family of Bell expressions
depending upon its violation of the non-trivial preparation non-contextual or
the local bound, thereby establishing a direct connection between quantum

general mixed $p$-spin glass models under the weak external field assumption:
$h= \rho N^{-\alpha}, \rho>0, \alpha \in [1/4,\infty]$. By extending the
cluster expansion approach to this generic setting, we convert the fluctuation
problem as a hypergraph counting problem and thus obtain a new
multiple-transition phenomenon. A by-product of our results is an explicit
characterization of the critical inverse temperature for general spin glass
models. In particular, all our fluctuation results hold up to the threshold.
Combining with multivariate Stein's method, we also obtain an explicit
convergence rate under proper moment assumptions on the general symmetric
disorder. Our results have several further implications. First, our approach
works for both even and odd pure $p$-spin models. The leading cluster
structures in the odd $p$ case are different and more involved than in the even
$p$ case. This combinatorially explains the folklore that odd $p$-spin is more
complicated than even $p$. Second, in the mixed $p$-spin setting, the cluster
structures differ depending on the relation between the minimum effective even
and odd $p$-spins: $p_e$ and $p_o$. As an example, at $h=0$, there are three
sub-regimes: $p_e<p_o, p_o<p_e<2p_o, p_e\ge 2p_o$, wherein the first and third
ones, the mixed model behaves essentially like a pure $p$-spin model, and only
in the second regime, it is more like a mixture. This gives another criterion
for classifying mean-field spin glass models compared to the work of Auffinger
and Ben Arous (Ann.~Probab.~41 (2013), no.~6, 4214--4247), where the idea is
based on complexity computations for spherical models. Third, our framework

to discriminate between turbulent and non-turbulent regions in an intermittent
velocity signal. The derivative-based detector function, which is commonly used
in intermittency calculation schemes, shows large fluctuations within turbulent
parts of the signal and requires averaging over a certain ``smoothing period''
to remove the fake drop-outs, introducing subjectivity in calculating
intermittency. The new detector function proposed here is obtained by averaging
the ``pre-multiplied wavelet energy'' over the entire frequency range,
resulting in a function that is much smoother than the derivative-based
detector and at the same time has a good discriminatory property. This makes
the choice of the smoothing period unnecessary and removes the subjectivity
associated with it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet detector
within the framework of the widely-used method by Hedley and Keffer (1974, J.
Fluid Mech., V64, pp625), for a range of velocity signals representing the
different stages of roughness-induced transition. The wavelet detector function
works well in detecting the edge intermittency of a canonical turbulent
boundary layer as well, thereby highlighting its generality. Our detector can,

the vicinity of saddle points, and not just of minimizers as it has been done
in the literature before. This becomes possible by using as an intermediate
step the recently introduced regularized continuous reformulation of a
cardinality-constrained optimization problem. We show that the Scholtes-type
regularization method is well-defined locally around a nondegenerate
T-stationary point of this regularized continuous reformulation. Moreover, the
nondegenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the corresponding Scholtes-type
regularization converge to a T-stationary point having the same index, i.e. its
topological type persists. Overall, we conclude that the global structure of
the regularized continuous reformulation and its Scholtes-type regularization

text that seems indistinguishable from human-written text and remarkably
photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the distribution of

diagnosing existing models and developing better models. We present MAUVE, a
family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those
encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are
statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in
generative modeling. We explore four approaches to statistically estimate these
scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, classifier-based
estimation, and parametric Gaussian approximations. We provide statistical
bounds for the vector quantization approach. Empirically, we find that the
proposed scores paired with a range of $f$-divergences and statistical
estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of
human-written text and those of modern neural language models by correlating
with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts.

typical magnitude less than 2, and reduced amplitudes at frequencies greater

associated with tectonic tremor and slow-slip events along the plate boundary
in subduction zones and occasionally transform fault zones. They are usually
grouped into families, with all the earthquakes of a given family originating
from the same small patch on the plate interface and recurring more or less
episodically in a bursty manner. In this study, we extend the LFE catalog
obtained by Plourde et al. (2015) during an episode of high tremor activity in
April 2008, to the 8-year period 2004-2011. All of the tremor in the Boyarko et
al. (2015) catalog south of 42 degrees North has associated LFE activity, but
we have identified several smaller episodes of LFEs without associated tremor
activity, and extend their catalog forward and backward by a total of about 3
years. As in northern Cascadia, the down-dip LFE families have recurrence
intervals several times smaller than the up-dip families. For the April 2008
Episodic Tremor and Slip event, the best recorded LFE families exhibit a strong
tidal Coulomb stress sensitivity starting 1.5 days after the rupture front
passes by each LFE family. The southernmost LFE family, which has been
interpreted to be on the subduction plate boundary, near the up-dip limit of
tremor, has a very short recurrence time. Also, these LFEs tend to occur during
times when predicted tidal Coulomb stress is discouraging slip on the plate
boundary. Both observations suggest this LFE family may be on a different
fault.

including cortical location of intracerebral hemorrhage, presence of
intraventricular hemorrhage, total hemorrhage volume, and history of alcohol

they can lead to sudden blood pressure fluctuations, increase intracranial

evidence does not support the routine use of antiseizure medication as primary

such as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the Maximal Overlap Discrete
Wavelet Transform (MODWT) are mathematical tools for analyzing time series
simultaneously in the time and the frequency domain by observing how weighted
differences of a time series vary from one period to the next. We use wavelet
methods to analyze GNSS time series of slow slip events in Cascadia. We use
detrended GNSS data, apply the MODWT transform and stack the wavelet details
over several nearby GNSS stations. As an independent check on the timing of
slow slip events, we also compute the cumulative number of tremor in the
vicinity of the GNSS stations, detrend this signal, and apply the MODWT
transform. In both time series, we can then see simultaneous waveforms whose
timing corresponds to the timing of slow slip events. We assume that there is a
slow slip event whenever there is a positive peak followed by a negative peak
in the wavelet signal. We verify that there is a good agreement between slow
slip events detected with only GNSS data, and slow slip events detected with

of magnitude higher than 6 as determined by independent event catalogs. As a

we propose NIRVANA, which treats videos as groups of frames and fits separate
networks to each group performing patch-wise prediction. This design shares
computation within each group, in the spatial and temporal dimensions,
resulting in reduced encoding time of the video. The video representation is
modeled autoregressively, with networks fit on a current group initialized
using weights from the previous group's model. To further enhance efficiency,
we perform quantization of the network parameters during training, requiring no
post-hoc pruning or quantization. When compared with previous works on the
benchmark UVG dataset, NIRVANA improves encoding quality from 37.36 to 37.70
(in terms of PSNR) and the encoding speed by 12X, while maintaining the same
compression rate. In contrast to prior video INR works which struggle with
larger resolution and longer videos, we show that our algorithm is highly
flexible and scales naturally due to its patch-wise and autoregressive designs.
Moreover, our method achieves variable bitrate compression by adapting to
videos with varying inter-frame motion. NIRVANA achieves 6X decoding speed and
scales well with more GPUs, making it practical for various deployment
scenarios.

provide decision-makers with valuable information about the inversion results.
For example, seismic inversion is a notoriously ill-posed inverse problem due
to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data. It is therefore of
paramount importance to quantify the uncertainties associated to the inversion
process to ease the subsequent interpretation and decision making processes.
Within this framework of reference, sampling from a target posterior provides a
fundamental approach to quantifying the uncertainty in seismic inversion.
However, selecting appropriate prior information in a probabilistic inversion
is crucial, yet non-trivial, as it influences the ability of a sampling-based
inference in providing geological realism in the posterior samples. To overcome
such limitations, we present a regularized variational inference framework that
performs posterior inference by implicitly regularizing the Kullback-Leibler
divergence loss with a CNN-based denoiser by means of the Plug-and-Play
methods. We call this new algorithm Plug-and-Play Stein Variational Gradient
Descent (PnP-SVGD) and demonstrate its ability in producing high-resolution,
trustworthy samples representative of the subsurface structures, which we argue
could be used for post-inference tasks such as reservoir modelling and history
matching. To validate the proposed method, numerical tests are performed on

  using a parallel transmit head coil","19 pages (8 pages main text) & 10 figures. To be submitted for review",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: Neurovascular MRI suffers from a rapid drop in B1+ into the neck
when using transmit head coils at 7T. One solution to improving B1+ magnitude
in the major feeding arteries in the neck is to use custom RF shims on parallel
transmit (pTx) head coils. However, calculating such shims requires robust
multi-channel B1+ maps in both the head and the neck, which is challenging due
to low RF penetration into the neck, limited dynamic range of multi-channel B1+
mapping techniques, and B0 sensitivity. We therefore sought a robust
large-dynamic-range pTx field mapping protocol, and tested whether RF shimming
can improve carotid artery B1+ in practice.
  Methods: A pipeline is presented that combines B1+ mapping data acquired
using circularly polarized (CP-) and CP2-mode RF shims at multiple voltages.
The pipeline was evaluated by comparing the predicted and measured B1+ for
multiple random transmit shims, and by assessing the ability of RF shimming to
increase the B1+ in the carotid arteries.
  Results: The proposed method achieved good agreement between predicted and
measured B1+ in both the head and the neck. The B1+ magnitude in the carotid
arteries can be increased by 42% using tailored RF shims or by 37% using
universal RF shims, while also improving the RF homogeneity compared to CP
mode.
  Conclusion: B1+ in the neck can be increased using RF shims calculated from
multi-channel B1+ maps in both the head and the neck. This can be achieved
using universal phase-only RF shims, facilitating easy implementation in

improve lives of people around the world, from business to healthcare, from

indirectly (e.g., loan disbursement, determining insurance coverage,
shortlisting applications, etc.). As a result, the concerns over such
AI-enabled systems are also increasing. To address these concerns, such systems
are mandated to be responsible i.e., transparent, fair, and explainable to
developers and end-users. In this paper, we present ComplAI, a unique framework
to enable, observe, analyze and quantify explainability, robustness,
performance, fairness, and model behavior in drift scenarios, and to provide a
single Trust Factor that evaluates different supervised Machine Learning models
not just from their ability to make correct predictions but from overall
responsibility perspective. The framework helps users to (a) connect their
models and enable explanations, (b) assess and visualize different aspects of
the model, such as robustness, drift susceptibility, and fairness, and (c)
compare different models (from different model families or obtained through
different hyperparameter settings) from an overall perspective thereby
facilitating actionable recourse for improvement of the models. It is model
agnostic and works with different supervised machine learning scenarios (i.e.,
Binary Classification, Multi-class Classification, and Regression) and
frameworks. It can be seamlessly integrated with any ML life-cycle framework.
Thus, this already deployed framework aims to unify critical aspects of
Responsible AI systems for regulating the development process of such real

Conversely, load distribution at the macro-scale changes the microstructural
response. These up-scaling and down-scaling relations are often modeled using
multiscale finite element (FE) approaches such as FE-squared ($FE^2$). However,
$FE^2$ requires numerous calculations at the micro-scale, which often renders
this approach intractable. This paper reports an enormously faster machine
learning (ML) based approach for multiscale mechanics modeling. The proposed
ML-driven multiscale analysis approach uses an ML-model that predicts the local
stress tensor fields in a linear elastic fiber-reinforced composite
microstructure. This ML-model, specifically a U-Net deep convolutional neural
network (CNN), is trained separately to perform the mapping between the spatial
arrangement of fibers and the corresponding 2D stress tensor fields. This
ML-model provides effective elastic material properties for up-scaling and
local stress tensor fields for subsequent down-scaling in a multiscale analysis
framework. Several numerical examples demonstrate a substantial reduction in
computational cost using the proposed ML-driven approach when compared with the
traditional multiscale modeling approaches such as full-scale FE analysis, and
homogenization based $FE^2$ analysis. This approach has tremendous potential in
efficient multiscale analysis of complex heterogeneous materials, with

magnetic flux ropes. Previous numerical studies have found that the equilibrium
of a coronal flux rope system could be disrupted if the axial magnetic flux of
the rope exceeds a critical value, so that the catastrophe occurs, initiating
the flux rope to erupt. Further studies discovered that the catastrophe does
not necessarily exist: the flux rope system with certain photospheric flux
distributions could be non-catastrophic. It is noteworthy that most previous
numerical studies are under the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) condition, so
that it is still elusive whether there is the catastrophe associated with the
critical axial flux if magnetic reconnection is included in the flux rope
system. In this paper, we carried out numerical simulations to investigate the
evolutions of coronal magnetic rope systems under the ideal MHD and the
resistive condition. Under the ideal MHD condition, our simulation results
demonstrate that the flux rope systems with either too compact or too weak
photospheric magnetic source regions are non-catastrophic versus varying axial
flux of the rope, and thus no eruption could be initiated; if there is magnetic
reconnection in the rope system, however, those flux rope systems could change
to be capable of erupting via the catastrophe associated with increasing axial
flux. Therefore, magnetic reconnection could significantly influence the
catastrophic behaviors of flux rope system. It should be both the magnetic
topology and the local physical parameters related to magnetic reconnection
that determine whether the increasing axial flux is able to cause flux rope
eruptions.

algebras were introduced by Hall, Rehren, and Shpectorov in 2015 as a broad
generalization of Majorana algebras of Ivanov, whose axioms were derived from
the properties of the Griess algebra for the Monster group.
  The class of Matsuo algebras was introduced by Matsuo and later generalized
by Hall, Rehren, and Shpectorov. A Matsuo algebra $M$ is built by a set of
3-transpositions $D$. Elements of $D$ are idempotents in $M$ and called axes.
In particular, $M$ is an example of an axial algebra. It is known that double
axes, i.e., sums of two orthogonal axes in a Matsuo algebra, satisfy the fusion
law of Monster type. This observation shows that a set consisting of axes and
double axes can generate a subalgebra of Monster type in the Matsuo algebra.
Subalgebras corresponding to various series of 3-transposition groups are
extensively studied by many authors.
  In this paper, we study primitive subalgebras generated by a single axis and
two double axes. We classify all such subalgebras in seven out of nine possible
cases for a diagram on 3-transpositions that are involved in the generating
elements. We also construct several infinite series of axial algebras of

Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL), namely, the time that a system or a piece of
equipment is still in working order before starting to function incorrectly. In
recent years, numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed for RUL
estimation, mainly focusing on providing more accurate RUL predictions.
However, there are many sources of uncertainty in the problem, such as inherent
randomness of systems failure, lack of knowledge regarding their future states,
and inaccuracy of the underlying predictive models, making it infeasible to
predict the RULs precisely. Hence, it is of utmost importance to quantify the
uncertainty alongside the RUL predictions. In this work, we investigate the
conformal prediction (CP) framework that represents uncertainty by predicting
sets of possible values for the target variable (intervals in the case of RUL)
instead of making point predictions. Under very mild technical assumptions, CP
formally guarantees that the actual value (true RUL) is covered by the
predicted set with a degree of certainty that can be prespecified. We study
three CP algorithms to conformalize any single-point RUL predictor and turn it
into a valid interval predictor. Finally, we conformalize two single-point RUL
predictors, deep convolutional neural networks and gradient boosting, and
illustrate their performance on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System

rotation of the Sun stretches out the poloidal field to produce the toroidal
field primarily at the bottom of the convection zone, from where parts of this
toroidal field may rise due to magnetic buoyancy to produce sunspots. In the
flux transport dynamo model, the decay of tilted bipolar sunspot pairs gives
rise to the poloidal field by the Babcock--Leighton mechanism. In this type of

restoration of real-world audio signals by Operational Generative Adversarial
Networks (Op-GANs) with temporal and spectral objective metrics to enhance the
quality of restored audio signal regardless of the type and severity of each
artifact corrupting it. Methods: 1D Operational-GANs are used with generative
neuron model optimized for blind restoration of any corrupted audio signal.
Results: The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively over the
benchmark TIMIT-RAR (speech) and GTZAN-RAR (non-speech) datasets corrupted with
a random blend of artifacts each with a random severity to mimic real-world
audio signals. Average SDR improvements of over 7.2 dB and 4.9 dB are achieved,
respectively, which are substantial when compared with the baseline methods.
Significance: This is a pioneer study in blind audio restoration with the
unique capability of direct (time-domain) restoration of real-world audio
whilst achieving an unprecedented level of performance for a wide SDR range and
artifact types. Conclusion: 1D Op-GANs can achieve robust and computationally
effective real-world audio restoration with significantly improved performance.
The source codes and the generated real-world audio datasets are shared
publicly with the research community in a dedicated GitHub repository1.

applied in the industry. Since manual data annotation is expensive and
inefficient, most applications adopt unsupervised anomaly detection methods,
but the results are usually sub-optimal and unsatisfactory to end customers.
Weak supervision is a promising paradigm for obtaining considerable labels in a
low-cost way, which enables the customers to label data by writing heuristic
rules rather than annotating each instance individually. However, in the
time-series domain, it is hard for people to write reasonable labeling
functions as the time-series data is numerically continuous and difficult to be
understood. In this paper, we propose a Label-Efficient Interactive Time-Series
Anomaly Detection (LEIAD) system, which enables a user to improve the results
of unsupervised anomaly detection by performing only a small amount of
interactions with the system. To achieve this goal, the system integrates weak
supervision and active learning collaboratively while generating labeling
functions automatically using only a few labeled data. All of these techniques
are complementary and can promote each other in a reinforced manner. We conduct
experiments on three time-series anomaly detection datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed system is superior to existing solutions in both weak supervision
and active learning areas. Also, the system has been tested in a real scenario
in industry to show its practicality.

heterogeneity in reporting styles, a nonparametric regression of integer
category numbers on that variable uncovers a positively-weighted linear
combination of causal responses among individuals who are on the margin between

ratio of local regression derivatives with respect to two such explanatory
variables identifies the relative magnitudes of convex averages of their

twinning superlattices (TSLs) based on the SnTe class of material is calculated
and discussed within a supercell implementation. The superlattices consist of
two twin planes (TPs) in the supercell arranged in such a way that each of the
boundaries forms a mirror plane for the entire structure. Two types of TP
boundary, cationic and anionic, can exist, and so three types of supercells can
be constructed. We study the topological phases of each twinning configuration
using the tight-binding approximation and calculating the topological
invariants. We show that they differ by topological properties. We find that
all-cationic TSLs are topologically distinct from the anionic case due to the
opposite sign of the Berry curvature around the $ \mathrm{ \Gamma} $ point of
the TSLs Brillouin Zone. Our findings are consistent with a complementary
analysis of (111)-oriented slabs with a single twin boundary in the presence of
the Zeeman field. They are also consistent with the number of spin-polarized
Dirac-like edge states of both superlattices and slabs. We conclude that each
type of TP forms the 2D mirror-plane-protected topological crystalline
insulator.

promising approach to mitigate attacks by dynamically altering target attack

open challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be an effective approach to

convolutional neural networks which were trained to classify colorectal cancer
tissue in hematoxylin-eosin stained samples into three classes: stroma, tumor
and other. The models were trained using a data set that consists of 1343 whole

learning approach using domain-specific data i.e. an external colorectal cancer
histopathological data set. The three most accurate models were chosen as a
classifier, TSR values were predicted and the results were compared to a visual
TSR estimation made by a pathologist. The results suggest that classification
accuracy does not improve when domain-specific data are used in the
pre-training of the convolutional neural network models in the task at hand.
Classification accuracy for stroma, tumor and other reached 96.1$\%$ on an
independent test set. Among the three classes the best model gained the highest
accuracy (99.3$\%$) for class tumor. When TSR was predicted with the best
model, the correlation between the predicted values and values estimated by an
experienced pathologist was 0.57. Further research is needed to study
associations between computationally predicted TSR values and other
clinicopathological factors of colorectal cancer and the overall survival of
the patients.

many solar power plants have been set up across the globe. However, in these

image segmentation model for the detection of internal faults such as hot spots

not available for large solar power plants, thus the proposed model is highly
recommended as it does not require any prior learning or training. It extracts
the features from the input image and segments out the faults in the image.
Here we use infrared thermal images of the PV panel as input, passed to a
convolutional neural network which assigns cluster labels to the pixels.
Further, optimize the pixel labels, features and model parameters using
backpropagation based on iterative stochastic gradient descent. Then, we
compute similarity loss and spatial continuity loss to assign the same label to
the pixel with similar features and spatial continuity to reduce noises in the
image segmentation process. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was

for the widely studied uniform linear array (ULA), the near-field regions at
large incidence angles will be reduced. Thus, many users randomly distributed

leverage the rotational symmetry of uniform circular array (UCA) to provide
uniform and enlarged near-field region for all users in a cell, enabling more
users to benefit from near-field communications. Specifically, by exploiting
the geometrical relationship between UCA and user with the spherical-wave
model, the near-field beamforming technique for UCA is developed for the first
time. Based on the analysis of near-field beamforming, we reveal that UCA is
able to provide a larger near-field region than ULA in terms of the effective
Rayleigh distance. Moreover, based on the UCA beamforming property, a
concentric-ring codebook is designed to realize efficient beamforming in the
near-field region of UCA. In addition, we find out that UCA could generate
orthogonal near-field beams along the same direction, which has the potential
for further improvement of multi-user capacity compared with ULA. Simulation
results are provided to verify the feasibility of UCA to enable more users to

can be a source of traversable WHs. In the manuscript published by the authors,
we show that this solution is possible for all space-time of dimension $D > 3$.
Recently, Garattini sought to analyze the effects of Yukawa-type terms on shape

questionable premises when establishing a non-homogeneity in the Equation of
State, when assuming a fixation between the constants that is only observed in
the usual model and when considering the Zero Tidal Condition, not observed in

Yukawa-type corrective factors on traversable wormhole solutions generated by
Casimir energy without assuming such premises. We observe that, in addition to
being possible to build traversable wormholes that satisfy all the necessary

that, in the global and constant cases, it is possible to set a value in the

with energy storage systems (ESSs) to mitigate its volatility. Sizing of wind
power generation and ESSs has become an important problem to be addressed. Wake
effect in a wind farm can cause wind speed deficits and a drop in downstream
wind turbine power generation, which however was rarely considered in the
sizing problem in power systems. In this paper, a bi-objective distributionally
robust optimization (DRO) model is proposed to determine the capacities of wind
power generation and ESSs considering the wake effect. An ambiguity set based
on Wasserstein metric is established to characterize the wind power and demand
uncertainties. In particular, wind power uncertainty is affected by the wind
power generation capacity which is determined in the first stage. Thus, the
proposed model is a DRO with endogenous uncertainty (or decision-dependent
uncertainty). To solve the proposed model, a stochastic programming
approximation method based on minimum Lipschitz constants is developed to turn
the DRO model into a linear program. Then, an iterative algorithm is built,
embedded with methods for evaluating the minimum Lipschitz constants. Case
studies demonstrate the necessity of considering wake effect and the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

performing long-time and large-size atomic simulations. We propose a
self-consistent picture as follows: (i) CoO$_2$ layers are easier to glide with
longer distances at more highly delithiated states, resulting in structural
transitions and structural inhomogeneity; (ii) at regions between different
phases with different Li distributions due to gliding, local strains are
induced and accumulate during cycling processes; (3) accumulated strains cause
the rupture of Li diffusion channels and result in formation of oxygen dimers
during cycling especially when Li has inhomogeneous distributions, leading to
capacity degradations and safety issues. We find that large tensile strains
combined with inhomogeneous distributions of Li ions play critical roles in the
formation processes of blocked Li diffusion channels and the oxygen dimers at
high-delithiation states, which could be the fundamental origins of capacity
degradations and safety issues. Correspondingly, suppressing accumulations of
strains by controlling charge and discharge conditions as well as suppressing
the gliding will be helpful for improving the performance of lithium-ion

explores the performance of hardware behavior-based individual device

this sense, it proposes an LSTM-CNN architecture based on hardware performance
behavior for individual device identification. Then, previous techniques have
been compared with the proposed architecture using a hardware performance

LSTM-CNN improves previous solutions achieving a +0.96 average F1-Score and 0.8

temperature-based context attack was not able to disrupt the identification.
However, some ML/DL state-of-the-art evasion attacks were successful. Finally,
adversarial training and model distillation defense techniques are selected to
improve the model resilience to evasion attacks, without degrading its

experimental demonstrations of laser-driven two-magnon modes - zone-edge

about the microscopic nature of the observed spin dynamics, the mechanism
underlying its excitation, and their macroscopic manifestation enabling

appropriate restrictions. In addition, going beyond the i.i.d. assumption, we
show that for states that are produced by a sequential process of quantum
channels, the smooth max relative entropy can be upper bounded by the sum of
appropriate channel relative entropies.
  Our main technical contributions are to extend to the context of general von
Neumann algebras a chain rule for quantum channels, as well as an additivity
result for the channel relative entropy with a replacer channel.

matter have been developed, and physical confinement to limited space and
active matter with broken rotational symmetry (chirality) are two prominent
mechanisms. However, the interplay between pattern formation due to physical
constraints and the ordering by chiral motion needs to be better understood. In
this study, we conduct numerical simulations of chiral self-propelled particles
under circular boundary confinement. The collective motion of confined
self-propelled particles can take drastically different forms depending on
their chirality. The balance of orientation changes between particle
interaction and the boundary wall is essential for generating ordered
collective motion. Our results clarify the role of the steric boundary effect

electromagnetic propagation to change from far-field to near-field. Due to the
near-field effect, the exhaustive near-field beam training at all angles and
distances requires very high overhead. The improved fast near-field beam
training scheme based on time-delay structure can reduce the overhead, but it
suffers from very high hardware costs and energy consumption caused by
time-delay circuits. In this paper, we propose a near-field two dimension (2D)
hierarchical beam training scheme to reduce the overhead without the need for
extra hardware circuits. Specifically, we first formulate the multi-resolution
near-field codewords design problem covering different angle and distance
coverages. Next, inspired by phase retrieval problems in digital holography
imaging technology, we propose a Gerchberg-Saxton (GS)-based algorithm to
acquire the theoretical codeword by considering the ideal fully digital
architecture. Based on the theoretical codeword, an alternating optimization
algorithm is then proposed to acquire the practical codeword by considering the
hybrid digital-analog architecture. Finally, with the help of multi-resolution
codebooks, we propose a near-field 2D hierarchical beam training scheme to
significantly reduce the training overhead, which is verified by extensive
simulation results.

the large-scale structure of the Universe, and the epoch of reionization (EoR).
Since carbon monoxide (CO) is the second most abundant molecule in the Universe
except for molecular hydrogen ${\rm H}_2$, it is suitable as a tracer for LIM
surveys. However, just like other LIM surveys, CO intensity mapping also
suffers strong foreground contamination that needs to be eliminated for
extracting valuable astrophysical and cosmological information. In this work,
we take $^{12}$CO($\it J$=1-0) emission line as an example to investigate
whether deep learning method can effectively recover the signal by removing the
foregrounds. The CO(1-0) intensity maps are generated by N-body simulations
considering CO luminosity and halo mass relation, and we discuss two cases with
median and low CO signals by comparing different relations. We add foregrounds
generated from real observations, including thermal dust, spinning dust,
free-free, synchrotron emission and CMB anisotropy. The beam with sidelobe

combines image generation algorithm UNet with the state-of-the-art architecture

recovering PCA signal loss and beam effects. Our method also can be applied to

ranging from biology to sociology. As the computational task of clustering
these networks into partitions, i.e., solving the community detection problem,
is generally NP-hard, heuristic solutions are indispensable. The exploration of
expedient heuristics has led to the development of particularly promising
approaches in the emerging technology of quantum computing. Motivated by the
substantial hardware demands for all established quantum community detection
approaches, we introduce a novel QUBO based approach that only needs
number-of-nodes many qubits and is represented by a QUBO-matrix as sparse as
the input graph's adjacency matrix. The substantial improvement on the sparsity
of the QUBO-matrix, which is typically very dense in related work, is achieved
through the novel concept of separation-nodes. Instead of assigning every node
to a community directly, this approach relies on the identification of a
separation-node set, which -- upon its removal from the graph -- yields a set
of connected components, representing the core components of the communities.
Employing a greedy heuristic to assign the nodes from the separation-node sets
to the identified community cores, subsequent experimental results yield a
proof of concept. This work hence displays a promising approach to NISQ ready
quantum community detection, catalyzing the application of quantum computers
for the network structure analysis of large scale, real world problem
instances.

growing. However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream
learning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory
such that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms
are chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated,
for problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings,
and/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts
into question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived
in such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose
to tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and
settings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary
considerations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh
look at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a
reconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through
and in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal
survey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide
recommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not
impose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning
regime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming.
Meanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal
dependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data
streams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing
with often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to
issues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly
relevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings.

between feasibility-seeking and constrained minimization. It is not trying to
solve the full-fledged constrained minimization problem composed from the
modeling constraints and the chosen objective function. Rather, the task is to
find a feasible point which is ""superior"" (in a well-defined manner) with
respect to the objective function, to one returned by a feasibility-seeking
only algorithm. We telegraphically review the superiorization methodology and
where it stands today and propose a rigorous formulation of its, yet only
partially resolved, guarantee problem. The real-world situation in an
application field is commonly represented by constraints defined by the
modeling process and the data, obtained from measurements or otherwise dictated
by the model-user. The feasibility-seeking problem requires to find a point in
the intersection of all constraints without using any objective function to aim
at any specific feasible point. At the heart of the superiorization methodology
lies the modeler desire to use an objective function, that is exogenous to the
constraints, in order to seek a feasible solution that will have lower (not
necessarily minimal) objective function value. This aim is less demanding than
full-fledged constrained minimization but more demanding than plain
feasibility-seeking. Putting emphasis on the need to satisfy the constraints,
because they represent the real-world situation, one recognizes the ""asymmetric
roles of feasibility-seeking and objective function reduction"", namely, that
fulfilling the constraints is the main task while reduction of the exogenous
objective function plays only a secondary role. There are two research
directions in the superiorization methodology: Weak superiorization and strong
superiorization.

accumulating the weight gradients. Another drawback is that that distribution
parameters (mean and standard deviation) are unlike all other model parameters

terms to the loss that, for each activation, cause the minimization of the
negative log likelihood of a Gaussian distribution that is used to normalize
the activation. Among other benefits, this will hopefully contribute to the

maneuvers such as throwing that take advantage of the potential energy stored
in joint springs. However, the energy storage and release could not be
well-timed yet. On the contrary, for multi-link systems, the natural system
dynamics might even work against the actual goal. With the introduction of
variable stiffness actuators, this problem has been partially addressed. With a
suitable optimal control strategy, the approximate decoupling of the motor from
the link can be achieved to maximize the energy transfer into the distal link
prior to launch. However, such continuous stiffness variation is complex and
typically leads to oscillatory swing-up motions instead of clear launch
sequences. To circumvent this issue, we investigate decoupling for speed
maximization with a dedicated novel actuator concept denoted Bi-Stiffness
Actuation. With this, it is possible to fully decouple the link from the joint
mechanism by a switch-and-hold clutch and simultaneously keep the elastic
energy stored. We show that with this novel paradigm, it is not only possible
to reach the same optimal performance as with power-equivalent variable
stiffness actuation, but even directly control the energy transfer timing. This
is a major step forward compared to previous optimal control approaches, which
rely on optimizing the full time-series control input.

image-to-image translation methods are not applicable to font generation, as
they often define style as the set of textures and colors. In this work, we
propose a robust deformable generative network for unsupervised font generation
(abbreviated as DGFont++). We introduce a feature deformation skip connection
(FDSC) to learn local patterns and geometric transformations between fonts. The
FDSC predicts pairs of displacement maps and employs the predicted maps to
apply deformable convolution to the low-level content feature maps. The outputs
of FDSC are fed into a mixer to generate final results. Moreover, we introduce
contrastive self-supervised learning to learn a robust style representation for
fonts by understanding the similarity and dissimilarities of fonts. To
distinguish different styles, we train our model with a multi-task
discriminator, which ensures that each style can be discriminated
independently. In addition to adversarial loss, another two reconstruction
losses are adopted to constrain the domain-invariant characteristics between
generated images and content images. Taking advantage of FDSC and the adopted
loss functions, our model is able to maintain spatial information and generates
high-quality character images in an unsupervised manner. Experiments
demonstrate that our model is able to generate character images of higher

introduces a novel methodology based on distributional RL to derive sequential

modelled by the tail of the return probability distribution. The core idea is
to replace the $Q$ function generally standing at the core of learning schemes

risk. Named the risk-based utility function $U$, it can be extracted from the
random return distribution $Z$ naturally learnt by any distributional RL

minimisation and expected return maximisation, in contrast to fully risk-averse

data locally for training and then aggregates the models on the server, which

intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ below a
known magnetic phase transition at $T_N$ = 29 K. The spins in this material are
widely believed to order in a highly symmetric collinear antiferromagnetic
configuration, causing extensive debate about how reports of an AHE can be
reconciled with such a state. In this article, we address this controversy by
presenting new neutron diffraction data on single crystals of
Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ and an analysis that implies that moments in this material
order into a non-collinear configuration, but one that maintains the same
refelction symmetries as the collinear phase. We present new transport and
magneto-optic Kerr measurements which show that AHE signatures persist below
$T_N$ to temperatures as low as $T$ = 5 K and firmly associate them with the
long-range antiferromagnetic order. Finally, we show that these AHE signatures
can be quantitatively reproduced by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations based on the lattice and spin state determined with neutron
diffraction. These combined findings establishes the veracity of the 'crystal
Hall effect' picture, which shows how such effects can emerge from the shape of
magnetic orbitals in compounds containing chiral lattice symmetry regardless of
the symmetry of the ordered spin configuration. These results illuminate a new
path for the discovery of anomalous Hall materials and motivate a targeted
study of the transport properties of intercalated TMDCs and other compounds

constructible sheaf methods, we compute the space of first-order Poisson

quasi-homogeneous singularities. (The latter is automatic if the surface is
projective.) Along the way, we find a tight connection between the Poisson

affine transformations, which is mediated by syzygies. In particular, we find
that the Hilbert scheme has a natural subvariety that serves as a global
counterpart of the nilpotent cone, and we prove that the Lie algebras of affine

computing from two-way data (matrices) to multiway data (tensors). However,
there is a drastic phase transition for most tensor optimization problems when
the order of a tensor increases from two (a matrix) to three: Most tensor
problems are NP-hard while that for matrices are easy. It triggers a question
on where exactly the transition occurs. The paper aims to study this kind of
question for the spectral norm and the nuclear norm. Although computing the
spectral norm for a general $\ell\times m\times n$ tensor is NP-hard, we show
that it can be computed in polynomial time if $\ell$ is fixed. This is the same
for the nuclear norm. While these polynomial-time methods are not implementable
in practice, we propose fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for
the spectral norm based on spherical grids and for the nuclear norm with
further help of duality theory and semidefinite optimization. Numerical
experiments on simulated data show that our FPTAS can compute these tensor
norms for small $\ell \le 6$ but large $m, n\ge50$. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first method that can compute the nuclear norm of
general asymmetric tensors. Both our polynomial-time algorithms and FPTAS can

  In this paper we present our work on a tool for the real world application of
integrating formal analysis with automatic test case generation. The test case
generation is based on coverage analysis using the Java bounded model checker

  In order to avoid the generation of redundant tests, it is necessary to
measure the coverage in the exact same way as JBMC generates its coverage
goals. Each existing coverage measurement tool uses a slightly different
instrumentation and thus a different coverage criterion. This makes integration
with a test case generator based on formal analysis difficult. Therefore, we
developed BlueCov as a specific runtime coverage measurement tool which uses
the exact same coverage criteria as JBMC does. This approach also allows for
incremental test-case generation, only generating test coverage for previously

optimizing the fabrication. With the Q factor of the LTOI microdisk increasing,
we can obtain higher pump light intensity in the cavity which is beneficial to
get more optical nonlinear effect easily. By making use of the mode phase
matching of interacting waves and inputting high pump power, we experimentally
observed on-chip near-infrared light, visible (red, green), and ultraviolet
(UV) from microresonator-based $ \chi^{(2)}-\chi^{(2)}$, $
\chi^{(2)}-\chi^{(3)}$, and $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear processes such as cascaded
four-wave mixing (cFWM), cascaded sum-frequency generation (cSFG), third
harmonic generation (THG), second harmonic generation (SHG). It is believed
that the LTOI can support a variety of on-chip optical nonlinear processes,
which heralds its new application potential in integrated nonlinear photonics.

learning a policy in this low dimensional representation. To do so we introduce
an algorithm that learns a mapping to a low dimensional representation, as a
narrow hidden layer of a deep neural network, in tandem with the policy using
DDPG. Our experiments show that a policy learnt this way perform on par or

relationships have established that the polar field is the primary determinant
of the future solar cycle amplitude. Models of solar surface evolution of

flux govern dynamics leading to the reversal and build-up of polar fields. Our
theoretical understanding and numerical models of this high latitude magnetic
field dynamics and plasma flows - that are a critical component of the sunspot
cycle - lack precise observational constraints. This limitation compromises our
ability to observe the enigmatic kilo Gauss polar flux patches and constrain
the polar field distribution at high latitudes. The lack of these observations
handicap our understanding of how high latitude magnetic fields power polar
jets, plumes, and the fast solar wind that extend to the boundaries of the
heliosphere and modulate solar open flux and cosmic ray flux within the solar

argues the scientific case for novel out of ecliptic observations of the Sun's

designs a stated choice survey in which respondents are faced with choice tasks

users from the three major metropolitan areas in Japan. To analyze the data,
mixed logit models capturing taste heterogeneity as well as flexible
substitution patterns have been estimated. The model estimation results
indicate that delivery attributes including fee, time, and time slot size are
significant determinants of the delivery option choices. Associations between
users' preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender,
teleworking frequency and the presence of a delivery box, were also suggested.
Moreover, we analyzed two willingness-to-pay measures for delivery, namely, the
value of delivery time savings (VODT) and the value of time slot shortening
(VOTS), and applied a non-semiparametric approach to estimate their
distributions in a data-oriented manner. Although VODT has a large
heterogeneity among respondents, the estimated median VODT is 25.6 JPY/day,
implying that more than half of the respondents would wait an additional day if
the delivery fee were increased by only 26 JPY, that is, they do not
necessarily need a fast delivery option but often request it when cheap or
almost free. Moreover, VOTS was found to be low, distributed with the median of
5.0 JPY/hour; that is, users do not highly value the reduction in time slot
size in monetary terms. These findings on e-commerce users' preferences can

memory-demanding 4D cost volumes and computationally intensive 3D convolutions

we merge two different concepts in one deeply integrated framework to achieve a
symbiotic relationship. A feature matching part is responsible for identifying
matching pixels pairs along the baseline while a concurrent image volume part
is inspired by depth-from-mono CNNs. However, instead of predicting depth
directly from image features, it provides additional context to resolve
ambiguities during pixel matching. More technically, the processing of the 4D
cost volume is separated into a 2D propagation and a 3D propagation part.
Starting from feature maps of the left image, the 2D propagation assists the 3D
propagation part of the cost volume at different layers by adding visual
features to the geometric context. By combining both parts, we can safely
reduce the scale of 3D convolution layers in the matching part without
sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end trained CNN
is ranked 2nd on KITTI2012 and ETH3D benchmarks while being significantly
faster than the 1st-ranked method. Furthermore, we notice that the coupling of

This performance relies heavily on the configuration of the network parameters.
However, with the massive increase in both the size and complexity of cellular

complicated. The current practice, which relies largely on experts' prior

handover parameter configuration. The key challenge, in this case, is to tackle
the complicated dependencies between neighboring cells and jointly optimize the

introduce a novel approach to imitate how the network responds to different

network (AG-GCN). During the parameter configuration stage, instead of solving
the global optimization problem, we design a local multi-objective optimization
strategy where each cell considers several local performance metrics to balance
its own performance and its neighbors. We evaluate our proposed algorithm via a
simulator constructed using real network data. We demonstrate that the handover
parameters our model can find, achieve better average network throughput

which can bring better network quality and stability. It has the potential to
massively reduce costs arising from human expert intervention and maintenance.

equations (PDEs) are fundamentally agnostic to domains, boundary conditions and
coefficients. In contrast, machine learnt solvers have a limited
generalizability across these elements of boundary value problems. This is
strongly true in the case of surrogate models that are typically trained on
direct numerical simulations of PDEs applied to one specific boundary value
problem. In a departure from this direct approach, the label-free machine
learning of solvers is centered on a loss function that incorporates the PDE
and boundary conditions in residual form. However, their generalization across
boundary conditions is limited and they remain strongly domain-dependent. Here,
we present a framework that generalizes across domains, boundary conditions and
coefficients simultaneously with learning the PDE in weak form. Our work
explores the ability of simple, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
encoder-decoder architectures to learn to solve a PDE in greater generality
than its restriction to a particular boundary value problem. In this first
communication, we consider the elliptic PDEs of Fickean diffusion, linear and
nonlinear elasticity. Importantly, the learning happens independently of any
labelled field data from either experiments or direct numerical solutions.
Extensive results for these problem classes demonstrate the framework's ability
to learn PDE solvers that generalize across hundreds of thousands of domains,
boundary conditions and coefficients, including extrapolation beyond the
learning regime. Once trained, the machine learning solvers are orders of
magnitude faster than discretization-based solvers. We place our work in the
context of recent continuous operator learning frameworks, and note extensions
to transfer learning, active learning and reinforcement learning.
