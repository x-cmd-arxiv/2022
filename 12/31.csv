  timing",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  As various city agencies and mobility operators navigate toward innovative
mobility solutions, there is a need for strategic flexibility in well-timed
investment decisions in the design and timing of mobility service regions, i.e.
cast as ""real options"" (RO). This problem becomes increasingly challenging with
multiple interacting RO in such investments. We propose a scalable machine
learning based RO framework for multi-period sequential service region design &
timing problem for mobility-on-demand services, framed as a Markov decision
process with non-stationary stochastic variables. A value function
approximation policy from literature uses multi-option least squares Monte
Carlo simulation to get a policy value for a set of interdependent investment
decisions as deferral options (CR policy). The goal is to determine the optimal
selection and timing of a set of zones to include in a service region. However,
prior work required explicit enumeration of all possible sequences of
investments. To address the combinatorial complexity of such enumeration, we
propose a new variant ""deep"" RO policy using an efficient recurrent neural
network (RNN) based ML method (CR-RNN policy) to sample sequences to forego the
need for enumeration, making network design & timing policy tractable for large
scale implementation. Experiments on multiple service region scenarios in New
York City (NYC) shows the proposed policy substantially reduces the overall
computational cost (time reduction for RO evaluation of > 90% of total
investment sequences is achieved), with zero to near-zero gap compared to the
benchmark. A case study of sequential service region design for expansion of
MoD services in Brooklyn, NYC show that using the CR-RNN policy to determine
optimal RO investment strategy yields a similar performance (0.5% within CR
policy value) with significantly reduced computation time (about 5.4 times
faster).

open questions: the electroweak (EW) naturalness problem, the generation of
neutrino masses and their flavour mixing, the nature of the inflaton, the
matter-antimatter asymmetry problem, the origin of dark matter, and the strong
CP problem. In this work, we will consider various possible solutions to these
problems for three inflation scenarios (Higgs, Starobinsky and
scale-independent inflation) in the minimal TNH model, where the Higgs is a
mixture of an elementary and a composite state with a compositeness scale much
larger than the EW scale. Traditionally, this requires an unnatural small
vacuum misalignment, but recently TNH models with compositeness scale up to the
Planck scale assisted by a novel mechanism have been proposed. This mechanism
is based on softly breaking a global $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ symmetry by technically
natural small vacuum misalignment, dynamically triggering the EW symmetry
breaking and fermion mass generation. With this mechanism, we will show that a
scale-invariant version of the minimal TNH model with a compositeness scale of
$ \mathcal{O}(10^{12}) $ GeV can both provide a technically natural 125 GeV
Higgs boson, scotogenic neutrinos, scale-invariant inflation and QCD axion dark
matter, which altogether dynamically induces the Planck scale and may answer

by introducing its twin -- a mirrored EW -- whereby two EWs related by
mirroring can bound the set of separable states more efficiently. In this work,
we investigate the relation between the EWs and its mirrored ones, and present
a conjecture which claims that the mirrored operator obtained from an optimal
EW is either a positive operator or a decomposable EW, which implies that
positive-partial-transpose entangled states, also known as the bound entangled
states, cannot be detected. This conjecture is reached by studying numerous
known examples of optimal EWs. However, the mirrored EWs obtained from the
non-optimal ones can be non-decomposable as well. We also show that mirrored
operators obtained from the extremal decomposable witnesses are positive
semi-definite. Interestingly, the witnesses that violate the well known
conjecture of Structural Physical Approximation, do satisfy our conjecture. The
intricate relation between these two conjectures is discussed and it reveals a
novel structure of the separability problem.

wavefunctions to functions which are not smooth, are inconsistent with
Poincar\'e symmetry: their product with the generators cannot be defined. Rough

the sample galaxies, of which 16 can be decomposed into a thin disk plus an
extended thick disk component. The median value of the scale height (h) of the
extended component is $1.13\pm 0.14$ kpc. We find a tight sublinear correlation
between h and the SFR. Moreover, the offset of individual galaxies from the
best-fit SFR-h relation shows significant anti-correlation with SFR_SD. This
indicates that galaxies with more intense star formation tend to have
disproportionately extended eDIG. Combined with data from the literature, we
find that the correlations between the eDIG properties and the galaxies'
properties extend to broader ranges. We further compare the vertical extension
of the eDIG to multi-wavelength measurements of other CGM phases. We find the
eDIG to be slightly more extended than the neutral gas (HI 21-cm line),
indicating the existence of some extended ionizing sources. Most galaxies have
an X-ray scale height smaller than the h, suggesting that the majority of the
X-ray emission detected in shallow observations are actually from the thick
disk. The h is comparable to the L-band radio continuum scale height, both
slightly larger than that at higher frequencies (C-band), where the cooling is
stronger and the thermal contribution may be larger. The comparable H$\alpha$
and L-band scale height indicates that the thermal and non-thermal electrons
have similar spatial distributions. This further indicates that the thermal
gas, the cosmics rays, and the magnetic field may be close to energy
equipartition.

action with a particular nonlinear ${\cal M}({\cal H})$ can be obtained from
the action for 11D multiple M-wave (multiple M0-brane or mM0) system. Then we
obtain the complete set of equations of motion of mD0 system with arbitrary
positive definite ${\cal M}({\cal H})$, perform a convenient gauge fixing,
solve the center of energy equations and establish an interesting
correspondence between the relative motion mD0 equations and the equations of
maximal supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory (SYM). We show that this

between solutions of the system. In particular, it implies that all the
supersymmetric solutions of mD0 equations in its relative motion part coincide
with supersymmetric solutions of the SYM equations.

on narrow infrared (IR) laser beams, a high-speed receiver with two key
specifications is needed: a sufficiently large aperture to collect the required
optical power and a wide field of view (FOV) to avoid strict alignment issues.
This paper puts forward the systematic design and optimisation of multi-tier
non-imaging angle diversity receivers (ADRs) composed of compound parabolic
concentrators (CPCs) coupled with photodiode (PD) arrays for laser-based
optical wireless communication (OWC) links. Design tradeoffs include the
gain-FOV tradeoff for each receiver element and the area-bandwidth tradeoff for
each PD array. The rate maximisation is formulated as a non-convex optimisation
problem under the constraints on the minimum required FOV and the overall ADR
dimensions to find optimum configuration of the receiver bandwidth and FOV, and
a low-complexity optimal solution is proposed. The ADR performance is studied
using computer simulations and insightful design guidelines are provided
through various numerical examples. An efficient technique is also proposed to
reduce the ADR dimensions based on CPC length truncation. It is shown that a
compact ADR with a height of $\leq0.5$ cm and an effective area of $\leq0.5$
cm$^2$ reaches a data rate of $12$ Gb/s with a half-angle FOV of $30^\circ$
over a $3$ m link distance.

fields and analyze it using a combination of Bethe ansatz and density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. We show that the system exhibits
several different ground states which depend on the orientation of the boundary
magnetic fields. When both the boundary fields take equal values greater than a
critical field strength, each edge in the ground state accumulates a fractional
spin which saturates to spin $\frac{1}{4}$, which is similar to systems
exhibiting symmetry protected topological phases (SPT). Unlike in SPT systems,
the fractional boundary spin in the Heisenberg spin chain is not a genuine
quantum number since the variance of the associated operator does not vanish,
this is due to the absence of a bulk gap. The system exhibits high energy bound
states when the boundary fields take values greater than the critical field.
All the excitations in the system can be sorted out into towers whose number
depends on the number of bound states exhibited by the system. As the boundary
fields are varied, in addition to the ground state phase transition, we find
that the system may undergo an eigenstate phase transition (EPT) where the
number of towers of the Hilbert space changes. We further inquire how the EPT
reflects itself on local ground state properties by computing the magnetization
profile $\langle S^z_j \rangle$ using DMRG. We identify a clear qualitative
change from low edge fields to high edge fields when crossing the critical
field. We though are unable to conclude on the basis of our data that EPT
corresponds to a genuine phase transition in the ground state.

  Libraries via Large Language Models","Accepted at ISSTA 2023",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Detecting bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch) is
critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness/safety
for end users. Meanwhile, traditional fuzzing techniques can be hardly
effective for such a challenging domain since the input DL programs need to
satisfy both the input language (e.g., Python) syntax/semantics and the DL API
input/shape constraints for tensor computations.
  To address these limitations, we propose TitanFuzz - the first approach to
directly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate input programs for
fuzzing DL libraries. LLMs are titanic models trained on billions of code
snippets and can auto-regressively generate human-like code snippets. Our key
insight is that modern LLMs can also include numerous code snippets invoking DL
library APIs in their training corpora, and thus can implicitly learn both
language syntax/semantics and intricate DL API constraints for valid DL program
generation. More specifically, we use both generative and infilling LLMs (e.g.,
Codex/InCoder) to generate and mutate valid/diverse input DL programs for
fuzzing. Our experimental results demonstrate that TitanFuzz can achieve
30.38%/50.84% higher code coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers on
TensorFlow/PyTorch. Furthermore, TitanFuzz is able to detect 65 bugs, with 41
already confirmed as previously unknown bugs.
  This paper demonstrates that modern titanic LLMs can be leveraged to directly
perform both generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing studied for decades,
while being fully automated, generalizable, and applicable to domains
challenging for traditional approaches (such as DL systems). We hope TitanFuzz
can stimulate more work in this promising direction of LLMs for fuzzing.

fluctuations of an open string worldsheet with AdS$_2$ geometry. In the
out-of-time-order configuration, the correlators display a Lyapunov growth that
saturates the chaos bound. We show that in a double-scaling limit interpolating
between the Lyapunov regime and the late time exponential decay, the
out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) can be obtained exactly, and it has the
same functional form found in the analogous calculation in JT gravity. The
result can be understood as coming from high energy scattering near the horizon
of a AdS$_2$ black hole, and is essentially controlled by the flat space
worldsheet S-matrix. While previous works on the AdS$_2$ string employed mainly
a static gauge approach, here we focus on conformal gauge and clarify the role
of boundary reparametrizations in the calculation of the correlators. We find
that the reparametrization mode is governed by a non-local action which is
distinct from the Schwarzian action arising in JT gravity, and in particular
leads to $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariant boundary correlators. The OTOC in the
double-scaling limit, however, has the same functional form as that obtained
from the Schwarzian, and it can be computed using the reparametrization action
and resumming a subset of diagrams that are expected to dominate in the limit.
One application of our results is to the defect CFT defined by the half-BPS
Wilson loop in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. In this context, we show that the exact result
for the OTOC in the double-scaling limit is in precise agreement with a recent
analytic bootstrap prediction to three-loop order at strong coupling.

resulting policies are often over-parameterized black boxes that are difficult
to interpret and deploy efficiently. More recent symbolic RL frameworks have
shown that high-level domain-specific programming logic can be designed to
handle both policy learning and symbolic planning. However, these approaches
rely on coded primitives with little feature learning, and when applied to
high-dimensional visual scenes, they can suffer from scalability issues and
perform poorly when images have complex object interactions. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{Differentiable Symbolic Expression Search}
(DiffSES), a novel symbolic learning approach that discovers discrete symbolic
policies using partially differentiable optimization. By using object-level
abstractions instead of raw pixel-level inputs, DiffSES is able to leverage the
simplicity and scalability advantages of symbolic expressions, while also
incorporating the strengths of neural networks for feature learning and
optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffSES is able to generate
symbolic policies that are simpler and more and scalable than state-of-the-art
symbolic RL methods, with a reduced amount of symbolic prior knowledge.

  Variable Models","85 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  With the attention mechanism, transformers achieve significant empirical
successes. Despite the intuitive understanding that transformers perform
relational inference over long sequences to produce desirable representations,
we lack a rigorous theory on how the attention mechanism achieves it. In
particular, several intriguing questions remain open: (a) What makes a
desirable representation? (b) How does the attention mechanism infer the
desirable representation within the forward pass? (c) How does a pretraining
procedure learn to infer the desirable representation through the backward
pass?
  We observe that, as is the case in BERT and ViT, input tokens are often
exchangeable since they already include positional encodings. The notion of
exchangeability induces a latent variable model that is invariant to input
sizes, which enables our theoretical analysis.
  - To answer (a) on representation, we establish the existence of a sufficient
and minimal representation of input tokens. In particular, such a
representation instantiates the posterior distribution of the latent variable
given input tokens, which plays a central role in predicting output labels and
solving downstream tasks.
  - To answer (b) on inference, we prove that attention with the desired
parameter infers the latent posterior up to an approximation error, which is
decreasing in input sizes. In detail, we quantify how attention approximates
the conditional mean of the value given the key, which characterizes how it
performs relational inference over long sequences.
  - To answer (c) on learning, we prove that both supervised and
self-supervised objectives allow empirical risk minimization to learn the
desired parameter up to a generalization error, which is independent of input
sizes. Particularly, in the self-supervised setting, we identify a condition
number that is pivotal to solving downstream tasks.

(ABPR) is used as a tool for discussing the effect of the size of the pairing
gap in three-flavor (CFL) quark matter on the maximum mass of hybrid neutron
stars (NSs). This equation of state (EOS) has three parameters which we suggest
to determine by comparison with a nonlocal NJL model of quark matter in the
nonperturbative domain. We show that due to the momentum dependence of the
pairing which is induced by the nonlocality of the interaction, the effective
gap parameter in the EOS model is well approximated by a constant value
depending on the diquark coupling strength in the NJL model Lagrangian. For the
parameter $a_4=1-2\alpha_s/\pi$ a constant value below about \num{0.4} is
needed to explain hybrid stars with ${\rm M}_{\rm max} \gtrsim 2.0~{\rm
M}_\odot$, which would translate to an effective constant $\alpha_s\sim 1$. The
matching point with a running coupling at the 1-loop $\beta$ function level is
found to lie outside the range of chemical potentials accessible in NS
interiors. A dictionary is provided for translating the free parameters of the
nlNJL model to those of the ABPR model. Both models are shown to be equivalent
in the nonperturbative domain but the latter one allows to quantify the
transition to the asymptotic behaviour in accordance with perturbative QCD. We
provide constraints on parameter sets that fulfill the $2~{\rm M}_\odot$ mass
constraint for hybrid NSs, as well as the low tidal deformability constraint
from GW170817 by a softening of the EOS on the hybrid NS branch with an early
onset of deconfinement at ${\rm M}_{\rm onset}<1.4~{\rm M}_\odot$. We find that
the effective constant pairing gap should be around 100 MeV but not exceed
values of about 130 MeV because a further increase of the gap would entail a

turn, depend on estimators of nuisance functions. In this paper, we consider a
parallel question of interest regarding the optimality and/or sub-optimality of

one can achieve minimax rates of convergence in all H\""older smoothness classes

reduction in modern algorithm design. The lemma states that any set of

dimensions while approximately preserving pairwise Euclidean distances. Random
matrices satisfying this lemma are called JL transforms (JLTs). Inspired by
existing $s$-hashing JLTs with exactly~$s$ nonzero elements on each column, the
present work introduces $s$-hashing-like matrices whose expected number of
nonzero elements on each column is~$s$. Unlike $s$-hashing matrices, the
independence of the sub-Gaussian entries of $s$-hashing-like matrices and the
knowledge of their exact distribution play an important role in their analyses.
Using properties of independent sub-Gaussian random variables, these matrices
are demonstrated to be JLTs, and their smallest and largest singular values are
estimated non-asymptotically in terms of known quantities using a technique
from geometric functional analysis, that is, without any unknown ``absolute
constant'' as is often the case in random matrix theory. By using the universal
Bai--Yin law, these singular values are proved to converge almost surely to
fixed quantities as the dimensions of the matrix grow to infinity. Numerical
experiments suggest that $s$-hashing-like matrices are more effective in
dimensionality reduction and have better behaviors of their extreme singular

characterized by a sharp, level-crossing transition at a critical value of the

the zero-quasimomentum Bloch state of a bare excitation represents the exact

coupling strength. We also show that -- based on the numerically evaluated
spectral function and its well-known relation with the survival probability of
the initial, bare-excitation Bloch state (the Loschmidt echo) -- one can make
predictions about the system dynamics following an excitation-phonon

a novel mechanism to substantially reduce the vacuum energy proposed in
arXiv:2110.10352. We address the two main problems concerning the light
axiodilaton that appears in the low-energy limit, namely that the axion has a
very low decay constant $f_a \sim $ eV (as read from its kinetic term) and that
the dilaton is subject to bounds that are relevant to tests of GR once
$\rho_{\rm vac} \leq 10^{-80} M_p^4$. We show that eV scale axion decay
constants need not be a problem by showing how supersymmetric extra dimensions
provide a sample unitarization for axion physics above eV scales for which
non-anomalous matter/axiodilaton couplings can really have gravitational
strength, showing how naive EFT reasoning can mistakenly overestimates axion
interactions at eV. When axions really do couple strongly at eV scales we
identify the dimensionless interaction in the UV completion that is also O(1),
and how axion energy-loss bounds map onto known extra-dimensional constraints.
We find a broad new class of exact exterior solutions to the vacuum axiodilaton
equations and knowledge of axiodilaton-matter couplings also allows us to
numerically search for interior solutions that match to known exterior
solutions that can evade solar-system tests. We find no examples that do so,
but also identify potential new candidate mechanisms for reducing the effective
dilaton-matter coupling to gravitating objects without also undermining the
underlying suppression of $\rho_{\rm vac}$.

priors when the input views are not sufficient in terms of coverage and

to be learned in a given or learned $3D$ canonical frame. In this paper, given
only the relative poses of the cameras, we show how to learn priors from
multiple views equivariant to coordinate frame transformations by proposing an
$SE(3)$-equivariant convolution and transformer in the space of rays in 3D.
This enables the creation of a light field that remains equivariant to the
choice of coordinate frame. The light field as defined in our work, refers both
to the radiance field and the feature field defined on the ray space. We model
the ray space, the domain of the light field, as a homogeneous space of $SE(3)$
and introduce the $SE(3)$-equivariant convolution in ray space. Depending on
the output domain of the convolution, we present convolution-based
$SE(3)$-equivariant maps from ray space to ray space and to $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our
mathematical framework allows us to go beyond convolution to
$SE(3)$-equivariant attention in the ray space. We demonstrate how to tailor

demonstrate $SE(3)$-equivariance by obtaining robust results in roto-translated

robust against adversarial attacks. Recently, different adversarial training
defenses are proposed that not only maintain a high clean accuracy but also
show significant robustness against popular and well studied adversarial
attacks such as PGD. High adversarial robustness can also arise if an attack
fails to find adversarial gradient directions, a phenomenon known as `gradient
masking'. In this work, we analyse the effect of label smoothing on adversarial
training as one of the potential causes of gradient masking. We then develop a
guided mechanism to avoid local minima during attack optimization, leading to a
novel attack dubbed Guided Projected Gradient Attack (G-PGA). Our attack
approach is based on a `match and deceive' loss that finds optimal adversarial
directions through guidance from a surrogate model. Our modified attack does
not require random restarts, large number of attack iterations or search for an
optimal step-size. Furthermore, our proposed G-PGA is generic, thus it can be
combined with an ensemble attack strategy as we demonstrate for the case of
Auto-Attack, leading to efficiency and convergence speed improvements. More
than an effective attack, G-PGA can be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal
elusive robustness due to gradient masking in adversarial defenses.

autonomously and distributedly by employing programmable switches. However, it
imposes further challenges to (i) find suitable INT paths to optimize the
control overhead and information freshness and (ii) ensure reliable delivery of

against potential failures in network telemetry collection due to network
congestion and link degradation that may cause loss of the visibility of the

P4, and compare it with traditional Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

mechanism against packet losses under different network conditions. Then, our
emulation results indicate that GPINT with reliability extension performs much
better than its opponent in terms of telemetry collection latency and overhead

providing a simple and unified framework for identifying the self-organization

the most relevant yet least redundant information quantified by von Neumann

their expected JWST/NIRCam photometry for degenerate solutions with NIRCam
dropouts. Towards this end, we quantify the contribution by strong emission

II/NIRES spectra of hot, dust-obscured, massive

increase broadband NIRCam fluxes by factors of 1.2-1.7 (0.2-0.6 mag). Due to
significant dust-attenuation ($A_V\sim6$), we find H$\alpha$+[NII] to be
significantly brighter than [OIII]+H$\beta$, and therefore find that
emission-line dominated contaminants of high-z galaxy searches can only
reproduce moderately blue perceived UV continua of

redshifts (z~3.75) where our stack is more degenerate with the photometry of

beyond $\lambda_{obs}>3.5\,\mu$m and far-IR/sub-mm follow-up may be useful for

quantum many-body scars. One of the consequences of quantum scarring is the
periodic revival of the wave function fidelity. It has been reported that
quantum fidelity revival occurs in the PXP model for certain product states,
and periodic driving of chemical potential can enhance the magnitude of quantum
revival, and can even change the frequencies of revival showing the subharmonic
response. Although the effect of the periodic driving in the PXP model has been
studied in the limit of certain perturbative regimes, the general mechanism of
such enhanced revival and frequency change has been barely studied. In this
work, we investigate how periodic driving in the PXP model can systematically
control the fidelity revival. Particularly, focusing on the product state so
called a Neel state, we analyze the condition of driving to enhance the
magnitude of revival or change the frequencies of revival. To clarify the
reason of such control, we consider the similarities between the PXP model and
the free spin-1/2 model in graph theoretical analysis, and show that the
quantum fidelity feature in the PXP model is well explained by the free
spin-1/2 model. In addition, under certain limit of the driving parameters,
analytic approach to explain the main features of the fidelity revival is also
performed. Our results give an insight of the scarring nature of the

identity-specific speaking style and facial idiosyncrasies of the target actor.
Specifically, we train a style-agnostic transformer on a large facial

Based on this prior, we optimize for identity-specific speaking style based on
a short reference video. To train the prior, we introduce a novel loss function

consequently improve the realism of the generated expressions. Through detailed

spatial superposition, the mere presence of a black hole in its vicinity will
eventually decohere the superposition. In this paper we show that, more
generally, decoherence of stationary superpositions will occur in any spacetime
with a Killing horizon. This occurs because, in effect, the long-range field of
the body is registered on the Killing horizon which, we show, necessitates a
flux of ""soft horizon gravitons/photons"" through the horizon. The Killing
horizon thereby harvests ""which path"" information of quantum superpositions and
will decohere any quantum superposition in a finite time. It is particularly
instructive to analyze the case of a uniformly accelerating body in a quantum
superposition in flat spacetime. As we show, from the Rindler perspective the
superposition is decohered by ""soft gravitons/photons"" that propagate through
the Rindler horizon with negligible (Rindler) energy. We show that this
decoherence effect is distinct from--and larger than--the decoherence resulting
from the presence of Unruh radiation. We further show that from the inertial
perspective, the decoherence is due to the radiation of high frequency
(inertial) gravitons/photons to null infinity. (The notion of gravitons/photons
that propagate through the Rindler horizon is the same notion as that of
gravitons/photons that propagate to null infinity.) We also analyze the
decoherence of a spatial superposition due to the presence of a cosmological
horizon in de Sitter spacetime. We provide estimates of the decoherence time

rest-frame spectral-energy distribution (SED) to nearly 1 micron for galaxies

the galaxies have, on average, rest-frame UV (1600 \r{A}) $-$ $I$-band colors
0.4 mag bluer than derived when using photometry that lacks MIRI. Therefore,
the galaxies have lower (stellar)-mass-to-light ratios. The MIRI data reduce
the stellar masses by $\langle \Delta\log M_\ast\rangle=0.25$ dex at $4<z<6$ (a
factor of 1.8) and 0.37 dex at $6<z<9$ (a factor of 2.3). This also reduces the
star-formation rates (SFRs) by $\langle \Delta\log\mathrm{SFR} \rangle=0.14$
dex at $4<z<6$ and 0.27 dex at $6<z<9$. The MIRI data also improve constraints
on the allowable stellar mass formed in early star-formation. We model this

the convective contribution thereof, this being expected to be dominant in
commonly encountered bubbly flows. We first extend the theory of Koch et al.
(1989) (which is for dispersion in fixed beds of solid particles under Stokes
flow) to account for weak inertial effects in the case of ordered suspensions.
In the limits of low and of high P\'eclet number, including inertial effect of
the flow does not affect the scaling of the effective diffusivity with respect
to the P\'eclet number. These results are confirmed by direct numerical
simulations performed in different flow regimes, for spherical or very deformed
bubbles and from vanishingly small to moderate values of the Reynolds number.
Scalar transport in arrays of freely rising bubbles is considered by us
subsequently, using numerical simulations. In this case, the dispersion is
found to be convectively enhanced at low P\'eclet number, like in ordered
arrays. At high P\'eclet number, the Taylor dispersion scaling obtained for
ordered configurations is replaced by the one characterizing a purely
mechanical dispersion, like in random media, even if the level of disorder is

simplification of the Navier--Stokes equations. The simplification is valid for
flows where the inertial forces are negligible compared to the viscous forces.
In infinite domains, this simplification leads to a fundamental paradox.
  In this work we review the Stokes paradox and present new insights related to
recent research. We approach the paradox from three different points of view:
modern functional analysis, numerical simulations, and classical analytic
techniques. The first approach yields a novel, rigorous derivation of the
paradox. We also show that relaxing the Stokes no-slip condition (by
introducing a Navier's friction condition) in one case resolves the Stokes
paradox but gives rise to d'Alembert's paradox.
  The Stokes paradox has previously been resolved by Oseen, who showed that it
is caused by a limited validity of Stokes' approximation. We show that the
paradox still holds for the Reynolds--Orr equations describing kinetic energy
flow instability, meaning that flow instability steadily increases with domain
size. We refer to this as an instability paradox.

approach to exploration can manifest as a suboptimal local maximum if a policy
learned with AIL sufficiently matches the expert distribution without fully
learning the desired task. This can be particularly catastrophic for
manipulation tasks, where the difference between an expert and a non-expert
state-action pair is often subtle. We present Learning from Guided Play (LfGP),
a framework in which we leverage expert demonstrations of multiple exploratory,
auxiliary tasks in addition to a main task. The addition of these auxiliary
tasks forces the agent to explore states and actions that standard AIL may
learn to ignore. Additionally, this particular formulation allows for the
reusability of expert data between main tasks. Our experimental results in a
challenging multitask robotic manipulation domain indicate that LfGP
significantly outperforms both AIL and behaviour cloning, while also being more
expert sample efficient than these baselines. To explain this performance gap,
we provide further analysis of a toy problem that highlights the coupling

for multi-layer networks allows layers to have different strengths of

probability of a relation between two actors (in a layer) depends on the
distances between their latent positions (multiplied by a layer-specific
factor) and the difference between their nodal attributes. Under our prior

restrictions on the memory size and the number of memory accesses per packet
make it impossible to design an efficient algorithm for pinpointing flows with

flows as possible, regardless of their sizes, but only for a short period at a
time. Next, we separately monitor the large flows over long periods, in
addition to the flow sampling. In both algorithms, we measure at the flow
level, and aggregate statistics and allocate memory at the prefix level. Our
simulation experiments, using packet traces from campus and backbone networks,
and our P4 prototype show that our algorithms correctly identify $80\%$ of the
prefixes with heavy packet reordering using moderate memory resources.

exchange in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The chemical exchange involves
spin jumps around different sites where the spin angular frequencies vary,
which leads to a random phase walk viewed from the rotating frame reference.
Therefore, the random walk in phase space can be treated by the effective phase
diffusion method. Both the coupled and uncoupled phase diffusions are
considered; additionally, it includes normal diffusion as well as fractional
diffusion. Based on these phase diffusion equations, the line shape of NMR
exchange spectrum can be analyzed. By comparing these theoretical results with
the conventional theory, this phase diffusion approach works for fast exchange,
ranging from slightly faster than intermediate exchange to very fast exchange.
For normal diffusion models, the theoretically predicted curves agree with
those predicted from traditional models in the literature, and the
characteristic exchange time obtained from phase diffusion with a fixed jump
time is the same as that obtained from the conventional model. However, the
phase diffusion with a monoexponential time distribution gives a characteristic
exchange time constant which is half of that obtained from the traditional
model. Additionally, the fractional diffusion obtains a significantly different
line shape than that predicted based on normal diffusion.

Large-scale clinical studies analyzing CCTA-derived metrics typically require
ground-truth validation in the form of high-fidelity 3D intravascular imaging.
However, manual rigid alignment of intravascular images to corresponding CCTA
images is both time consuming and user-dependent. Moreover, intravascular
modalities suffer from several non-rigid motion-induced distortions arising
from distortions in the imaging catheter path. To address these issues, we here
present a semi-automatic segmentation-based framework for both rigid and
non-rigid matching of intravascular images to CCTA images. We formulate the
problem in terms of finding the optimal \emph{virtual catheter path} that
samples the CCTA data to recapitulate the coronary artery morphology found in
the intravascular image. We validate our co-registration framework on a cohort
of $n=40$ patients using bifurcation landmarks as ground truth for longitudinal

registration significantly outperforms other co-registration approaches for
luminal bifurcation alignment in both longitudinal (mean mismatch: 3.3 frames)

differentiable framework for automatic multi-modal intravascular data fusion,
our developed co-registration modules significantly reduces the manual effort
required to conduct large-scale multi-modal clinical studies while also
providing a solid foundation for the development of machine learning-based

chaos in acoustics and dielectric microresonator problems. RBFs have been
gaining popularity recently for solving partial differential equations
numerically, becoming an extremely effective tool for interpolation on
scattered node sets in several dimensions with high-order accuracy and
flexibility for nontrivial geometries. One key issue with infinitely smooth
RBFs is the choice of a suitable value for the shape parameter which controls
the flatness of the function. It is observed that best accuracy is often
achieved when the shape parameter tends to zero. However, the system of
discrete equations obtained from the interpolation matrices becomes
ill-conditioned, which imposes severe limits to the attainable accuracy. A few
numerical algorithms have been presented that are able to stably compute an
interpolant, even in the increasingly flat basis function limit. We present the
recently developed Stabilized Local Boundary Domain Integral Method in the
context of boundary integral methods that improves the solution of the
Helmholtz equation with RBFs. Numerical results for small shape parameters that
stabilize the error are shown. Accuracy and comparison with other methods are
also discussed for various case studies. Applications in wave chaos, acoustics

contribution into and out of a projection. This allows the importance of the
variable to structure in the projection to be assessed. This work describes a
mixed-design user study evaluating the radial tour's efficacy compared with
principal component analysis and the grand tour. A supervised classification
task is assigned to participants who evaluate variable attribution of the
separation between two classes. Their accuracy in assigning the variable
importance is measured across various factors. Data were collected from 108
crowdsourced participants, who performed two trials with each visual for 648
trials in total. Mixed model regression finds strong evidence that the radial
tour results in a large increase in accuracy over the alternatives.
Participants also reported a preference for the radial tour in comparison to
the other two methods.

the $c\to d/s\ell^+\nu_\ell$ transitions with the SU(3) flavor symmetry
approach, where $P$ denotes the pseudoscalar meson, $V$ denotes the vector

different decay amplitudes of the $D\to P\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $D\to
V\ell^+\nu_\ell$ or $D\to S\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays can be related by using the
SU(3) flavor symmetry and by considering the SU(3) flavor breaking. Using the

not yet well measured processes in the $D\to P/V/S\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays. We
find that the SU(3) flavor symmetry approach works well in the semileptonic $D

decay $D^+_s\to f_0(980)e^+\nu_e$ has been measured, the branching ratios of
the $D^+_s\to f_0(980)e^+\nu_e$ and $D\to S(S\to P_1P_2)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays

measured $D \to S\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays, in addition, the two quark and the
four quark scenarios for the light scalar mesons are analyzed. The SU(3) flavor
symmetry predictions of the $D \to S\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays need to be further
tested, and our predictions of the $D \to S\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are useful
for probing the structure of light scalar mesons. Our results in this work

with two phases of single-stance (support) phase and the collision phase. The
dynamic equations of the robot in each phase are extracted by the Lagrange

The gait is optimized with a method called hybrid optimization. The objective
function of this problem is considered to be the integral of torque-squared

satisfied without any approximation. Furthermore, in a new framework, there is
presented a constraint called impact invariance, which ensures the periodicity

clusters on the surface of TI Bi$_{0.91}$Sb$_{0.09}$. We find that the
resulting heterostructure supports phase-slip lines that act as effective
Josephson junctions. We probe the response of the system to microwave
radiation. We find that for some ac frequencies, and powers, the resulting
Shapiro steps' structure of the voltage-current characteristic exhibits a
missing first step and an unexpectedly wide second Shapiro step. The
theoretical analysis of the measurements shows that the unusual Shapiro
response arises from the interplay between a static Josephson junction and a
dynamic one, and allows us to identify the conditions under which the missing
first step can be attributed to the topological nature of the Josephson
junctions formed by the phase-slip lines. Our results suggest a new approach to
induce superconductivity in a TI, a novel route to realizing highly-transparent
topological Josephson junctions, and show how the response of superconducting
systems to microwave radiation can be used to infer the dynamics of phase-slip

Exchange simulations indicate that the evaluation parameter of the total
exchange divided by the Gini index can be expressed by the same saturated

costs and independence based on the morality of mutual aid, a nonequivalent
exchange without return obligation is preferred. This is oriented toward
Graeber's baseline communism and Karatani's mode of exchange D, with

  resonances in periodic structures",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  While resonant modes do not exist within band gaps in infinite periodic
materials, they may appear as in-gap localized edge modes once the material is
truncated to form a finite periodic structure. Here, we provide an analysis
framework that reveals the topological origins of truncation resonances,
elucidating formally the conditions that influence their existence and
properties. Elastic beams with sinusoidal and step-wise property modulations
are considered as classical examples of periodic structures. Their non-trivial
topological characteristics stem from the consideration of a phason parameter
that produces spatial shifts of the property modulation while continuously
varying how the boundaries are truncated. In this context, non-trivial band
gaps are characterized by an integer topological invariant, the Chern number,
which is equal to the number of truncation resonances that traverse a band gap
as the phason is varied. We highlight the existence of multiple chiral edge
states that may be localized at opposite boundaries, and illustrate how these
can be independently tuned by modified boundary-specific phason parameters.
Furthermore, we show that the frequency location of a truncation resonance is
influenced by the modulation volume fraction, boundary conditions, and number
of cells comprising the finite structure, thus quantifying its robustness to
these factors. Non-topological in-gap resonances induced by a defect are also
demonstrated, showing that these can be coupled with topological modes when the
defect is located at an edge. Finally, experimental investigations on
bi-material phononic-crystal beams are conducted to support these findings. The
tunability of truncation resonances by material-property modulation may be
exploited in applications ranging from vibration attenuation and thermal
conductivity reduction to filtering and flow control by phononic subsurfaces.

In fact, we point out certain unnatural restrictions in the foliated RG, and
find that removing these restrictions leads to a generalized foliated RG under

original foliated RG as a special case. The Ising cage-net model thus gives a
prototypical example of the generalized foliated RG, and its system size can be
changed either by condensing / uncondensing bosonic planon excitations near a

that these two apparently different RG procedures are closely related, as they
lead to the same gapped boundary when implemented in part of a plane. Finally,

standard notion of (statistical) differential privacy (SDP) proposed by Beimel,
Nissim, and Omri (CRYPTO 2008) and Mironov, Pandey, Reingold, and Vadhan
(CRYPTO 2009). In contrast to SDP, CDP only requires privacy guarantees to hold
against computationally-bounded adversaries rather than
computationally-unbounded statistical adversaries. Despite the question being
raised explicitly in several works (e.g., Bun, Chen, and Vadhan, TCC 2016), it
has remained tantalizingly open whether there is any task achievable with the
CDP notion but not the SDP notion. Even a candidate such task is unknown.
Indeed, it is even unclear what the truth could be!
  In this work, we give the first construction of a task achievable with the
CDP notion but not the SDP notion. More specifically, under strong but
plausible cryptographic assumptions, we construct a task for which there exists
an $\varepsilon$-CDP mechanism with $\varepsilon = O(1)$ achieving $1-o(1)$
utility, but any $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-SDP mechanism, including
computationally unbounded ones, that achieves a constant utility must use
either a super-constant $\varepsilon$ or a non-negligible $\delta$. To prove
this, we introduce a new approach for showing that a mechanism satisfies CDP:
first we show that a mechanism is ""private"" against a certain class of decision
tree adversaries, and then we use cryptographic constructions to ""lift"" this
into privacy against computational adversaries. We believe this approach could
be useful to devise further tasks separating CDP from SDP.

However, it requires considerably precise phase control with temporally severe

entire system beyond the tabletop size as most of the current application
systems. Here, we propose a much simpler and easier scaling-up method of
airborne ultrasound convergence, where a binary amplitude mask that serves as a
Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) is placed on the planar in-phase ultrasound sources.
  We experimentally demonstrate that the FZP-based ultrasound focusing achieved
a spatial resolution that is comparable to conventional methods, based on the
use of phase-controlled transducers. The ultrasound foci created using FZPs are
sufficiently intense for most application scenarios that are currently in
practical use. We also determine favorable side effects of our method
suppressing grating lobes, which is inevitable with the conventional
phase-controlling method.
  The FZPs and planar ultrasound sources are both readily implemented with
inexpensive ingredients and components. The result of our study contributes to
upsizing dimensions in which a mid-air convergent ultrasound field is

Therefore, the approach in this paper is that cyber-physical virtual

Moreover, many obstacles exist which is harmful for linear trajectory control
in real-world battlefield scenarios. Thus, our proposed autonomous nonlinear
drone mobility control algorithm utilizes situation-aware components those are
implemented with a Raycast function in Unity virtual scenarios. Based on the
gathered situation-aware information, the drone can autonomously and
nonlinearly adjust its trajectory during flight. Therefore, this approach is
obviously beneficial for avoiding obstacles in obstacle-deployed battlefields.

appeared as a powerful DL-based tool for solving the inverse problem by
characterizing the attributes of a signal as a continuous function of
corresponding coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we proposed
an INR-based method to improve dynamic MRI reconstruction from highly

implicit function and encodes them into neural networks. The weights of the
network are learned from sparsely-acquired (k, t)-space data itself only,
without external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong
implicit continuity regularization of INR together with explicit regularization
for low-rankness and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms the compared
scan-specific methods at various acceleration factors. E.g., experiments on
retrospective cardiac cine datasets show an improvement of 5.5 ~ 7.1 dB in PSNR
for extremely high accelerations (up to 41.6-fold). The high-quality and inner
continuity of the images provided by INR has great potential to further improve
the spatiotemporal resolution of dynamic MRI, without the need of any training

randomness, we formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process

edge computing resource allocation are jointly considered to minimize the

different inference services. Since CMDP cannot be directly solved by general

optimization technique. Then, a deep RL-based algorithm is proposed to solve
the MDP. To expedite the training process, an optimization subroutine is
embedded in the proposed algorithm to directly obtain the optimal edge

demonstrate that the proposed RL-based algorithm can significantly reduce the

we put forward a hybrid quantization (HQ) module to obtain the optimal bit

ability of self-judgment. A switch control machine (SCM) builds a bridge
between the student network and teacher network in the same location to help
the teacher to reduce wrong guidance and impart vital knowledge to the student.
This distillation method allows a model to learn from itself and gain
substantial improvement without any additional supervision. Extensive
experiments on a multimodal dataset (VEDAI) and single-modality datasets (DOTA,

non-adaptive monotone decision trees - decision trees where each query is a
monotone function on the input bits. In the most general setting, the monotone
decision tree height (or size) can be viewed as a measure of non-monotonicity
of a given Boolean function. We also study the restriction of the model by
restricting (in terms of circuit complexity) the monotone functions that can be
queried at each node. This naturally leads to complexity classes of the form
DT(mon-C) for any circuit complexity class C, where the height of the tree is
O(log n), and the query functions can be computed by monotone circuits in the
class C. In the above context, we prove the following characterizations and
bounds.
  For any Boolean function f, we show that the minimum monotone decision tree
height can be exactly characterized (both in the adaptive and non-adaptive
versions of the model) in terms of its alternation (alt(f) is defined as the
maximum number of times that the function value changes, in any chain in the
Boolean lattice). We also characterize the non-adaptive decision tree height
with a natural generalization of certification complexity of a function.
Similarly, we determine the complexity of non-deterministic and randomized
variants of monotone decision trees in terms of alt(f).
  We show that DT(mon-C) = C when C contains monotone circuits for the
threshold functions (for e.g., if C = TC0). For C = AC0, we are able to show
that any function in AC0 can be computed by a sub-linear height monotone
decision tree with queries having monotone AC0 circuits. To understand the
logarithmic height case in case of AC0 i.e., DT(mon-AC0), we show that
functions in DT(mon-AC0) have AC0 circuits with few negation gates.

The MHD system was driven at the bottom boundary by photospheric velocity

the spectrogram of sound and input image is processed by a backbone network for
feature extraction. Then, to build multi-scale hierarchical information of

from multiple layers of the backbone network. Notably, to well represent the
salient regions and contextual information of audio-visual inputs, the salient

memory characteristics (gradual change in resistance states). The analog RS
properties of memristive devices widen their application domain to a much
broader field of neuromorphic computing. The tunability of memristive devices
to digital or analog memory applications greatly depends upon the switching
medium. In this work, we report a comparative study on RS properties of two
kinds of memristive devices based upon copper (I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a
solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) made up of CuSCN as ionic moieties in
polyethylene oxide (PEO). The device (ITO/CuSCN/Cu), prepared by spin-coating
CuSCN layer between ITO and copper electrode, shows simultaneous analog and
digital RS characteristics. The RS property of the device is tunable by varying
the thickness of the CuSCN layer. The current-voltage characteristics reveal
that devices prepared at 3000 rpm (thicker) during the spin-coating show only
digital bipolar RS memory. In comparison, the devices deposited at 4000 rpm
(thinner) show both analog and digital RS memory. The conduction mechanism
responsible for RS behavior in CuSCN-based devices is Schottky emission
mediated charge trapping and de-trapping at the interfacial states.
Contrastingly, when the same CuSCN is used as the electrolyte in SPE film, the
device only shows bipolar digital non-volatile memory characteristics. The RS
behavior is due to the electrochemical metallization (ECM) mechanism. The ON
and OFF states are achieved by the formation and rupture of copper filaments
due to the redox reactions at the interface.

uses an artificial neural network trained to learn large-scale neural dynamics
as a surrogate brain. By perturbing each region of the surrogate brain and
observing the resulting responses in all other regions, the human EBC is
obtained. This connectome captures the directionality, strength, and
excitatory-inhibitory distinction of brain-wide causal relationships, offering
mechanistic insights into cognitive processes. EBC provides a complete picture
of information flow both within and across brain functional networks as well as
reveals the large-scale hierarchy of the organization of excitatory and

devoted to devising rotation-invariant feature descriptors or learning

we review rotation invariance in terms of point cloud registration and propose
an effective framework for rotation invariance learning via three sequential
stages, namely rotation-invariant shape encoding, aligned feature integration,
and deep feature registration. We first encode shape descriptors constructed
with respect to reference frames defined over different scales, e.g., local
patches and global topology, to generate rotation-invariant latent shape codes.
Within the integration stage, we propose Aligned Integration Transformer to
produce a discriminative feature representation by integrating point-wise self-
and cross-relations established within the shape codes. Meanwhile, we adopt
rigid transformations between reference frames to align the shape codes for
feature consistency across different scales. Finally, the deep integrated
feature is registered to both rotation-invariant shape codes to maximize
feature similarities, such that rotation invariance of the integrated feature
is preserved and shared semantic information is implicitly extracted from shape
codes. Experimental results on 3D shape classification, part segmentation, and
retrieval tasks prove the feasibility of our work. Our project page is released

localization strength, which our newly proposed metric can effectively
quantify. The metric reveals the deep connection between the critical and

create opportunities for studying strong-field physics under extreme

laser powers higher than hundreds of terawatts are involved. In this paper, by
utilizing the radiative spin-flip effect, we find that the spin depolarization
of an electron beam can be employed to diagnose characteristics of ultrafast
ultraintense lasers with peak intensities around $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$~W/cm$^2$.
With three shots, our machine-learning-assisted model can predict,
simultaneously, the pulse duration, peak intensity, and focal radius of a
focused Gaussian ultrafast ultraintense laser (in principle, the profile can be
arbitrary) with relative errors of $0.1\%$-$10\%$. The underlying physics and
an alternative diagnosis method (without the assistance of machine learning)
are revealed by the asymptotic approximation of the final spin degree of
polarization. Our proposed scheme exhibits robustness and detection accuracy
with respect to fluctuations in the electron beam parameters. Accurate
measurements of the ultrafast ultraintense laser parameters will lead to much
higher precision in, for example, laser nuclear physics investigations and

discovery, but the task is complicated by the high cost of chemical synthesis
and validation. With their outstanding performance in de novo drug design, deep
generative models represent promising tools for tackling this challenge. In
recently years, 3D molecule generative models have gained increasing attention
due to their ability to directly utilize the 3D interaction information between
the target and ligand. However, it remains challenging to synthesize the
molecules generated by these models, limiting the speed of bioactivity
validation and further structure optimization. In this work, we propose
DeepLigBuilder+, a deep generative model for 3D molecules that combines
structure-based de novo drug design with a reaction-based generation framework.
Besides producing 3D molecular structures, the model also proposes synthetic
pathways for generated molecules, which greatly assists the retro-synthetic
analysis. To achieve this, we developed a new way to enforce the
synthesizability constraint using a tree-based organization of purchasable
building blocks. This method enjoys high scalability and is compatible with
existing atom-based generative models. Additionally, for structure-based design
tasks, we developed an SE(3)-equivariant transformer conditioned on the shape
and pharmacophore-based inputs, and combine it with the Monte Carlo tree
search. Using the ATP-binding pocket of BTK and the NAD+ binding pocket of
PHGDH for case studies, we demonstrate that DeepLigBuilder+ is capable of
enriching drug-like molecules with high predicted binding affinity and
desirable interaction modes while maintaining the synthesizability constraint.
We believe that DeepLigBuilder+ is a powerful tool for accelerating the process
of drug discovery.

known as link prediction, is a long-standing challenge in graph data analysis.
With the recent advances in deep learning, graph neural networks have been used
for link prediction and have achieved state-of-the-art performance.
Nevertheless, existing methods developed for this purpose are typically
discriminative, computing features of local subgraphs around two neighboring
nodes and predicting potential links between them from the perspective of
subgraph classification. In this formalism, the selection of enclosing
subgraphs and heuristic structural features for subgraph classification
significantly affects the performance of the methods. To overcome this
limitation, this paper proposes a novel and radically different link prediction
algorithm based on the network reconstruction theory, called GraphLP. Instead
of sampling positive and negative links and heuristically computing the
features of their enclosing subgraphs, GraphLP utilizes the feature learning
ability of deep-learning models to automatically extract the structural
patterns of graphs for link prediction under the assumption that real-world
graphs are not locally isolated. Moreover, GraphLP explores high-order
connectivity patterns to utilize the hierarchical organizational structures of
graphs for link prediction. Our experimental results on all common benchmark
datasets from different applications demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the
discriminative neural network models used for link prediction, GraphLP is
generative, which provides a new paradigm for neural-network-based link
prediction.

evolution is similar in the NIR and optical. The morphology of the ER has been
skewed toward the west side (with roughly 2/3 of the NIR emission originating
there) since around 2010. A steady decline in the ER flux, broadly similar to
the MIR and the optical, is ongoing since roughly this time as well. The
expansion velocity of the ER hotspots in the NIR is fully consistent with the
optical. However, continuum emission forms roughly 70 per cent of the NIR
luminosity, and is relatively stronger outside the hotspot-defined extent of
the ER than the optical emission or NIR line emission since 2012--2013,
suggesting a faster-expanding continuum component. We find that this outer NIR
emission can have a significant synchrotron contribution. Even if emission from
hot ($\sim$2000~K) dust is dominant within the ER, the mass of this dust must
be vanishingly small (a few $\times10^{-12}$~M$_\odot$) compared to the total
dust mass in the ER ($\gtrsim10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$) to account for the observed

increasingly important. The Shapley value has attracted increasing interest for
redistribution in energy settings - however, computing it exactly is
intractable beyond a few dozen prosumers. In this paper, we first conduct a
systematic review of the literature on the use of Shapley value in
energy-related applications, as well as efforts to compute or approximate it.
Next, we formalise the main methods for approximating the Shapley value in
community energy settings, and propose a new one, which we call the stratified
expected value approximation. To compare the performance of these methods, we
design a novel method for exact Shapley value computation, which can be applied
to communities of up to several hundred agents by clustering the prosumers into
a smaller number of demand profiles. We perform a large-scale experimental
comparison of the proposed methods, for communities of up to 200 prosumers,
using large-scale, publicly available data from two large-scale energy trials
in the UK (UKERC Energy Data Centre, 2017, UK Power Networks Innovation, 2021).
Our analysis shows that, as the number of agents in the community increases,
the relative difference to the exact Shapley value converges to under 1% for
all the approximation methods considered. In particular, for most experimental
scenarios, we show that there is no statistical difference between the newly
proposed stratified expected value method and the existing state-of-the-art
method that uses adaptive sampling (O'Brien et al., 2015), although the cost of
computation for large communities is an order of magnitude lower.

from -2600 to 500 bar when they are represented as a function of supercooling.
This allows us to identify universal empirical expressions for homogeneous ice
nucleation in the pressure range from -2600 to 500 bar. We show that this
universal behavior arises from the pressure dependence of the interfacial free
energy which we compute by means of the mold integration technique finding a
shallow minimum around -2000 bar. Likewise, we show that the change in the
interfacial free energy with pressure is proportional to the excess entropy and
the slope of the melting line, exhibiting the latter a reentrant behavior also
at the same negative pressure. Finally, we estimate the excess energy and the
excess entropy of the ice Ih-water interface.

properties is presently of great interest to the materials science community.
However, due to the difficulty of designing these alloys using traditional

Particularly, the screening of candidate alloy compositions using surrogate
models has become a mainstay of materials design in recent years. Many of these
models use the atomic fractions of the alloying elements as inputs. However,
there are many possible representation schemes for encoding alloy compositions,
including both unstructured and structured variants. As the input features play
a critical role in determining surrogate model performance, we have
systematically compared these representation schemes on the basis of their
performance in single-task deep learning models and in transfer learning
scenarios. The results from these tests indicate that compared to the
unstructured and randomly ordered schemes, chemically meaningful arrangements
of elements within spatial representation schemes generally lead to better
models. However, we also observed that tree-based models using only the atomic
fractions as input were able to outperform these models in transfer learning.

leverages captions in three ways: i) Input data: video-caption pairs can
augment the training data. ii) Intermediate feature interaction: we perform
cross-modal feature interaction between the video and caption to produce

aspects of the medium such as anisotropy, the presence of medium particle
collisions, and finite baryonic chemical potential. The first two facets have
been studied several times from different perspectives but the inclusion of
finite chemical potential is a missing part. Therefore, to have a close
analysis, we have combined these effects. The medium particle collision has
been included using BGK- collisional kernel, the anisotropy, and finite
chemical potential enter via quarks, anti-quarks and gluons distribution

enhances the magnitude of unstable modes which may affect the fast

generic two-stage distributionally robust linear program (2-DRLP) over a
1-Wasserstein ball using an affine policy. The 2-DRLP has right-hand-side
uncertainty with a rectangular support. Our main contribution is to show that
the 2-DRLP problem has a tractable reformulation with a scale independent of
sample size. The reformulated problem can be solved within a pre-defined
optimality tolerance using robust optimization techniques. To reduce the
inevitable conservativeness of the affine policy while preserving independence
of sample size, we further develop a method for constructing an uncertainty set
with a probabilistic guarantee over which the Wasserstein ball is re-defined.
As an application, we present a novel unit commitment model for power systems

slumping regime of turbidity (particle-laden) currents in two lock-release
(dam-break) systems with inclined bottoms. We identify 3 regimes controlled by
the ratio between settling and current inertia. (i) For negligible settling,
the turbidity current morphodynamics correspond to those of saline homogeneous
gravity currents, in terms of velocity, slumping (constant-velocity) regime
duration and current morphology. (ii) For intermediate settling, the slumping
regime duration decreases to become fully controlled by a particle settling
characteristic time. (iii) When settling overcomes the current initial inertia,
the slumping (constant-velocity) regime is not detected any more. In the first
two regimes, the current velocity increases with the bottom slope, of about
$35~\%$ between $0^\circ$ and $15^\circ$. Finally, our experiments show that
the current propagates during the slumping regime with the same shape in the
frame of the moving front. Strikingly, the current head is found to be
independent of all experimental parameters covered in the present study. We
also quantify water entrainment coefficients $E$ and compare them with previous

applications such as search and rescue, landing on a moving platform, etc. In
this work, we have developed an integrated system for the UAV landing on the
moving platform, and the UAV object detection with tracking in the complicated
environment. Firstly, we have proposed a robust LoG-based deep neural network
for object detection and tracking, which has great advantages in robustness to
object scale and illuminations compared with typical deep network-based
approaches. Then, we have also improved based on the original Kalman filter and
designed an iterative multi-model-based filter to tackle the problem of unknown
dynamics in real circumstances of motion estimations. Next, we implemented the
whole system and do ROS Gazebo-based testing in two complicated circumstances
to verify the effectiveness of our design. Finally, we have deployed the
proposed detection, tracking, and motion estimation strategies into real
applications to do UAV tracking of a pillar and obstacle avoidance. It is
demonstrated that our system shows great accuracy and robustness in real
applications.

models with abstract actions can be related to low-level models in which these
actions are refined by sequences of concrete actions. We describe the
connection between high-level and low-level actions using \emph{action codes},
a variation of the prefix codes known from coding theory. For each action code
${\mathcal{R}}$, we introduce a \emph{contraction} operator
$\alpha_{\mathcal{R}}$ that turns a low-level model $\mathcal{M}$ into a
high-level model, and a \emph{refinement} operator $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}$ that
transforms a high-level model $\mathcal{N}$ into a low-level model. We
establish a Galois connection $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\mathcal{N}) \sqsubseteq
\mathcal{M} \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{N} \sqsubseteq
\alpha_{\mathcal{R}}(\mathcal{M})$, where $\sqsubseteq$ is the well-known
simulation preorder. For conformance, we typically want to obtain an
overapproximation of model $\mathcal{M}$. To this end, we also introduce a
\emph{concretization} operator $\gamma_{\mathcal{R}}$, which behaves like the
refinement operator but adds arbitrary behavior at intermediate points, giving
us a second Galois connection $\alpha_{\mathcal{R}}(\mathcal{M}) \sqsubseteq
\mathcal{N} \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{M} \sqsubseteq
\gamma_{\mathcal{R}}(\mathcal{N})$. Action codes may be used to construct
adaptors that translate between concrete and abstract actions during learning
and testing of Mealy machines. If Mealy machine $\mathcal{M}$ models a
black-box system then $\alpha_{\mathcal{R}}(\mathcal{M})$ describes the
behavior that can be observed by a learner/tester that interacts with this
system via an adaptor derived from code ${\mathcal{R}}$. Whenever
$\alpha_{\mathcal{R}}(\mathcal{M})$ implements (or conforms to) $\mathcal{N}$,
we may conclude that $\mathcal{M}$ implements (or conforms to)
$\gamma_{{\mathcal{R}}} (\mathcal{N})$.

In our work we explore to what extent a similar relation is true for block

nonsubordinacy in the sense of matrix generalized eigenvectors also implies the
absolute continuity, similarly as in the case of the scalar Jacobi operator.
Namely, we get the absolute continuity of the matrix spectral measure with the
invertibility of its density almost everywhere. We also present an example
showing that the reverse implication in general does not hold. We extend some
sufficient conditions for nonsubordinacy from the scalar to the block case.
Finally, we give applications of our results to some classes of block Jacobi

method correctly and efficiently identifies the experimentally observed spin
spiral, skyrmion lattice and ferromagnetic ground states as a function of
external magnetic field. To our knowledge, no other optimization method has
until now succeeded in doing this. We envision that our findings will pave the

purity is more important to limit the bimolecular recombination and to obtain

design as it can balance the model accuracy and cost of sample preparation by
fusing low- and high-fidelity data. However, the cost for building a
multi-fidelity Kriging model increases significantly with the increase of the
problem dimension. To attack this issue, an efficient Hierarchical Kriging
modeling method is proposed. In building the low-fidelity model, the maximal
information coefficient is utilized to calculate the relative value of the
hyperparameter. With this, the maximum likelihood estimation problem for
determining the hyperparameters is transformed as a one-dimension optimization
problem, which can be solved in an efficient manner and thus improve the
modeling efficiency significantly. A local search is involved further to
exploit the search space of hyperparameters to improve the model accuracy. The
high-fidelity model is built in a similar manner with the hyperparameter of the
low-fidelity model served as the relative value of the hyperparameter for
high-fidelity model. The performance of the proposed method is compared with
the conventional tuning strategy, by testing them over ten analytic problems
and an engineering problem of modeling the isentropic efficiency of a
compressor rotor. The empirical results demonstrate that the modeling time of
the proposed method is reduced significantly without sacrificing the model
accuracy. For the modeling of the isentropic efficiency of the compressor
rotor, the cost saving associated with the proposed method is about 90%

experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground
state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to
one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly
in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore
one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully
magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an
xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning
and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a
reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to 50% of the
original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the
formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the
final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical
noise. Our experimental and theoretical studies highlight the potential and
challenges for adiabatic preparation protocols to prepare many-body eigenstates

a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of
moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet
diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid
crystal in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles
generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean
molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase droplets are either
attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of
the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam
results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the
substrate. We understand this behavior as due to the coupling between the
polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in
the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is
not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of
the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

conference adopted a middle ground by initially anonymizing the author
identities from reviewers, revealing them after the reviewer had submitted
their initial reviews, and allowing the reviewer to change their review
subsequently. We present an analysis of the reviews pertaining to the
identification and use of author identities. Our key findings are: (I) A
majority of reviewers self-report not knowing and being unable to guess the
authors' identities for the papers they were reviewing. (II) After the initial
submission of reviews, only 7% of reviews changed their overall merit score and
3.8% changed their self-reported reviewer expertise. (III) Even among reviews
that changed, there was little correlation between the change in overall merit
and the rank of the authors' affiliations (Kendall tau b correlation
coefficient = 0.09). We also conducted an anonymous survey to obtain opinions
from reviewers and authors. The main findings from the 200 survey responses
are: (i) A vast majority of participants favor anonymizing author identities in
some form. (ii) The ""middle-ground"" initiative of ITCS 2023 was appreciated.
(iii) Detecting conflicts of interest is a challenge that needs to be addressed
if author identities are anonymized. Overall, these findings support
anonymization of author identities in some form (e.g., as was done in ITCS

(XLFs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in order
to understand the AGN population's cosmological properties and evolution. We
present a new fixed rest-frame method to achieve a more accurate study of the
AGN XLF evolution over cosmic time. Normally, XLFs are constructed in a fixed
observer-frame energy band, which can be problematic because it probes
different rest-frame energies at different redshifts. In the new method, we
construct XLFs in the fixed rest-frame band instead, by varying the observed
energy band with redshift. We target a rest-frame 2$-$8 keV band using
XMM-Newton and HEAO 1 X-ray data, with 7 observer-frame energy bands that vary
with redshift for $0 < z < 3$. We produce the XLFs using two techniques; one to
construct a binned XLF, and one using a Maximum Likelihood (ML) fit, which
makes use of the full unbinned source sample. We find that our ML best-fit pure
luminosity evolution (PLE) results for both methods are consistent with each
other, suggesting that performing XLF evolution studies with the high-redshift
data limited to high-luminosity AGN is not very sensitive to the choice of
fixed observer-frame or rest-frame energy band, which is consistent with our
expectation that high-luminosity AGN typically show little absorption. We have
demonstrated the viability of the new method in measuring the XLF evolution.

flows, the above interpretation of the LBM as a general numerical tool, allows
the LBM to be extended to solid mechanics as well. In this spirit, the LBM has
been studied in recent years. First publications [3], [4] presented an LBM
scheme for the numerical solution of the dynamic behavior of a linear elastic
solid under simplified deformation assumptions. For so-called anti-plane shear
deformation, the only non-zero displacement component is governed by a
two-dimensional wave equation. In this work, an existing LBM for the
two-dimensional wave equation is extended to more general plane strain
problems. The proposed algorithm reduces the plane strain problem to the
solution of two separate wave equations for the volume dilatation and the
non-zero component of the rotation vector, respectively. A particular focus is
on the implementation of types of boundary conditions that are commonly
encountered in engineering practice for solids: Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions. Last, several numerical experiments are conducted that highlight
the performance of the new LBM in comparison to the Finite Element Method.

alleviate this issue, we introduce a conceptually simple yet learning-efficient

For disjoint masking (DM), we sequentially sample multiple masked views per
image in a mini-batch with the disjoint regulation to raise the usage of tokens
for reconstruction in each image while keeping the masking rate of each view.
For joint distillation (JD), we adopt a dual branch architecture to
respectively predict invisible (masked) and visible (unmasked) tokens with
superior learning targets. Rooting in orthogonal perspectives for training
efficiency improvement, DM and JD cooperatively accelerate the training
convergence yet not sacrificing the model generalization ability. Concretely,
DM can train ViT with half of the effective training epochs (3.7 times less
time-consuming) to report competitive performance. With JD, our DMJD clearly
improves the linear probing classification accuracy over ConvMAE by 5.8%. On
fine-grained downstream tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection,

low-resource language translation. With active learning, a semi-supervised
machine learning strategy, the training algorithm determines which unlabeled
data would be the most beneficial for obtaining labels using selected query
techniques. We implemented two model-driven acquisition functions for selecting
the samples to be validated. This work uses transformer-based NMT systems;
baseline model (BM), fully trained model (FTM) , active learning least
confidence based model (ALLCM), and active learning margin sampling based model
(ALMSM) when translating English to Hindi. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy
(BLEU) metric has been used to evaluate system results. The BLEU scores of BM,
FTM, ALLCM and ALMSM systems are 16.26, 22.56 , 24.54, and 24.20, respectively.
The findings in this paper demonstrate that active learning techniques helps
the model to converge early and improve the overall quality of the translation
system.

improves robustness by reducing drawdown in regime changes. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the creation of model ensembles through dynamic model

performances. We also evaluate the robustness of our pipeline across different

strategy of the algorithm is to enumerate specific types of residual laser
frequency noise associated with second-order commutators in products of

time residual when expanded in time derivatives of the armlengths order by
order. It is observed that the solutions obtained by such a scheme are
primarily captured by the geometric TDI approach and therefore possess an
intuitive interpretation. Nonetheless, the fully-symmetric Sagnac and
Sagnac-inspired combinations inherit the properties from the original algebraic

explicitly show that novel solutions, distinct from existing ones in terms of
both algebraic structure and sensitivity curve, are encountered. Moreover, at
its lowest order, the solution is furnished by commutators of relatively
compact form. Besides the original Michelson-type solution, we elaborate on
other types of solutions such as the Monitor, Beacon, Relay, Sagnac,

visual privacy leaks on the Internet. UEs are training samples added with
invisible but unlearnable noise, which have been found can prevent unauthorized
training of machine learning models. UEs typically are generated via a bilevel
optimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from
the original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown
target models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal
assumption called label-consistency, where the hackers and protectors are
assumed to hold the same label for a given sample. In this work, we propose and
promote a more practical label-agnostic setting, where the hackers may exploit
the protected data quite differently from the protectors. E.g., a m-class
unlearnable dataset held by the protector may be exploited by the hacker as a
n-class dataset. Existing UE generation methods are rendered ineffective in
this challenging setting. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel

take the role of investigators who want to trace the attack and identify the
source, that is, the particular model which the adversarial examples are
generated from. Techniques derived would aid forensic investigation of attack
incidents and serve as deterrence to potential attacks. We consider the
buyers-seller setting where a machine learning model is to be distributed to
various buyers and each buyer receives a slightly different copy with same
functionality. A malicious buyer generates adversarial examples from a
particular copy $\mathcal{M}_i$ and uses them to attack other copies. From
these adversarial examples, the investigator wants to identify the source
$\mathcal{M}_i$. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage
separate-and-trace framework. The model separation stage generates multiple
copies of a model for a same classification task. This process injects unique
characteristics into each copy so that adversarial examples generated have
distinct and traceable features. We give a parallel structure which embeds a
``tracer'' in each copy, and a noise-sensitive training loss to achieve this
goal. The tracing stage takes in adversarial examples and a few candidate
models, and identifies the likely source. Based on the unique features induced
by the noise-sensitive loss function, we could effectively trace the potential
adversarial copy by considering the output logits from each tracer. Empirical
results show that it is possible to trace the origin of the adversarial example
and the mechanism can be applied to a wide range of architectures and datasets.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2105.14073",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.FL math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a learning agent infers a reward
function encoding the underlying task using demonstrations from experts.
However, many existing IRL techniques make the often unrealistic assumption
that the agent has access to full information about the environment. We remove
this assumption by developing an algorithm for IRL in partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We address two limitations of existing IRL
techniques. First, they require an excessive amount of data due to the
information asymmetry between the expert and the learner. Second, most of these
IRL techniques require solving the computationally intractable forward problem
-- computing an optimal policy given a reward function -- in POMDPs. The
developed algorithm reduces the information asymmetry while increasing the data
efficiency by incorporating task specifications expressed in temporal logic
into IRL. Such specifications may be interpreted as side information available
to the learner a priori in addition to the demonstrations. Further, the
algorithm avoids a common source of algorithmic complexity by building on
causal entropy as the measure of the likelihood of the demonstrations as
opposed to entropy. Nevertheless, the resulting problem is nonconvex due to the
so-called forward problem. We solve the intrinsic nonconvexity of the forward
problem in a scalable manner through a sequential linear programming scheme
that guarantees to converge to a locally optimal policy. In a series of
examples, including experiments in a high-fidelity Unity simulator, we
demonstrate that even with a limited amount of data and POMDPs with tens of
thousands of states, our algorithm learns reward functions and policies that
satisfy the task while inducing similar behavior to the expert by leveraging
the provided side information.

theoretic setup for this purpose, driven by an axionic Bell pair resulting from
Type IIB string compactification on a Calabi-Yau three fold. We take into
account a spherical surface that divides the spatial slice of the global de
Sitter space into exterior and interior causally unrelated sub regions. For the
computational purpose we use the simplest possible initial choice of quantum
vacuum, which is Bunch-Davies state. The quantitative quantum information
theoretic measure for entanglement negativity turns out be consistent with the
results obtained for entanglement entropy, even we have to say it is better
than that from quantum information theoretic point of view. We design the
problem in a hyperbolic open chart where one of the causally unrelated
observers remains constrained and the scale dependence enters to the
corresponding quantum information theoretic entanglement measure for axionic
Bell pair.We find from our analysis that in the large scales initially
maximally entangled Bunch-Davies state turns out to be strongly entangled or
weakly entangled depending on the axionic decay constant and the supersymmetry
breaking scale. We also find that at the small scales the initial entanglement
can be perfectly recovered.We also discuss the possibility of having a biverse

sustainability of transport system in the context of district 8 of Tehran,
Iran, focusing on needs of disadvantaged groups, and giving suggestions to
ameliorate the condition of transport planning using a mixed method research
consist of face-to-face focus groups with elderlies, children, women and
disabled people, questionnaire, map analysis (network analysis using ArcGIS)
and key informant interview. The results reveal that there are various burdens
for disadvantaged people including lack of enthusiasm toward active modes of
transport because of safety problems, cost-ineffectiveness and inefficacy of
public transportation for some disabled individuals. The recommendations for
the area regarding the problems are dividing the district into smaller
sub-districts, designing a complete street and location allocation of a park
and ride system.

  Outside of Spacetime?",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent experimental studies on human cognition, particularly where
non-separable or entangled cognitive states have been found, show that in many
such cases Bell or CHSH inequalities have been violated. The implications are
that greater non-local correlations than allowed in quantum mechanics (often
known as the Tsirelson bound), are found in human cognition. However, it is
also evident that surpassing of Tsirelson limit within relativistic physical
Spacetime seems impossible. Tsirelson limit is not guaranteed by no-signaling
condition, but some deeper feature like indistinguishability of identical
quantum particles might be related to such an upper bound in quantum physics,
within relativistic Spacetime. We propose in the current paper that a non-local
theory of mind is needed in order to account for the empirical findings. This
requires a foundationally different approach than the extant 'quantum-like'
approach to human mind. To account for the surpassing of the Tsirelson bound we
propose abandoning the constraint of no-signaling that depends upon spacetime.
Thus, we ask: 'Is mind outside spacetime?' We discuss a candidate theory of
quantum gravity based on nonlocality as fundamental that may accord with our
proposal. We are led to suggest a new 6 - part ontological framework linking
Mind, Matter, and Cosmos.

  Polynomials",,,,,"math.NA cs.CV cs.NA eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the most effective orthogonal moments, discrete Racah polynomials
(DRPs) and their moments are used in many disciplines of sciences, including
image processing, and computer vision. Moments are the projections of a signal
on the polynomial basis functions. Racah polynomials were introduced by Wilson
and modified by Zhu for image processing and they are orthogonal on a discrete
set of samples. However, when the moment order is high, they experience the
issue of numerical instability. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for
the computation of DRPs coefficients called Improved Stabilization (ImSt). In
the proposed algorithm, {the DRP plane is partitioned into four parts, which
are asymmetric because they rely on the values of the polynomial size and the
DRP parameters.} The logarithmic gamma function is utilized to compute the
initial values, which empower the computation of the initial value for a wide
range of DRP parameter values as well as large size of the polynomials. In
addition, a new formula is used to compute the values of the initial sets based
on the initial value. Moreover, we optimized the use of the stabilizing
condition in specific parts of the algorithm. ImSt works for wider range of
parameters until higher degree than the current algorithms. We compare it with
the other methods in a number of experiments.

  (2023)","10.1007/s11128-022-03804-2",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The behaviour of genuine EPR steering of three qubit states under various
environmental noises is investigated. In particular, we consider the two
possible steering scenarios in the tripartite setting: (1 -> 2), where Alice
demonstrates genuine steering to Bob-Charlie, and (2 -> 1), where Alice-Bob
together demonstrates genuine steering to Charlie. In both these scenarios, we
analyze the genuine steerability of the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(gGHZ) states or the W-class states under the action of noise modeled by
amplitude damping (AD), phase flip (PF), bit flip (BF), and phase damping (PD)
channels. In each case, we consider three different interactions with the noise
depending upon the number of parties undergoing decoherence. We observed that
the tendency to demonstrate genuine steering decreases as the number of parties
undergoing decoherence increases from one to three. We have observed several
instances where the genuine steerability of the state revives after collapsing
if one keeps on increasing the damping. However, the hidden genuine
steerability of a state cannot be revealed solely from the action of noise. So,
the parties having a characterized subsystem, perform local pre-processing
operations depending upon the steering scenario and the state shared with the
dual intent of revealing hidden genuine steerability or enhancing it.
