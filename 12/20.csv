some part of the data and tasking the network to predict it from the remaining
part. Towards this end, masking has emerged as a generic and powerful tool
where content is withheld along the sequential dimension, e.g., spatial in
images, temporal in audio, and syntactic in language. In this paper, we explore
the orthogonal channel dimension for generic data augmentation. The data for
each channel is quantized through a non-uniform quantizer, with the quantized
value sampled randomly within randomly sampled quantization bins. From another
perspective, quantization is analogous to channel-wise masking, as it removes
the information within each bin, but preserves the information across bins. We
apply the randomized quantization in conjunction with sequential augmentations
on self-supervised contrastive models. This generic approach achieves results
on par with modality-specific augmentation on vision tasks, and
state-of-the-art results on 3D point clouds as well as on audio. We also
demonstrate this method to be applicable for augmenting intermediate embeddings
in a deep neural network on the comprehensive DABS benchmark which is comprised
of various data modalities. Code is availabel at

that are not bound to any single galaxy but were formed in galaxies and later
unbound from them. In this review we focus on the physical properties - phase
space properties, metallicity and age distribution - of the ICL and IGL
components of the groups and clusters in the local universe, within 100 Mpc
distance. Kinematic information on these very low surface brightness structures
mostly comes from discrete tracers such as planetary nebulae and globular
clusters, showing highly unrelaxed velocity distributions. Cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations provide key predictions for the dynamical state of
IGL and ICL and find that most IC stars are dissolved from galaxies that
subsequently merge with the central galaxy. The increase of the measured
velocity dispersion with radius in the outer halos of bright galaxies is a
physical feature that makes it possible to identify IGL and ICL components. In
the local groups and clusters, IGL and ICL are located in the dense regions of
these structures. Their light fractions relative to the total luminosity of the
satellite galaxies in a given group or cluster are between a few to ten
percent, significantly lower than the average values in more evolved, more
distant clusters. IGL and ICL in the Leo I and M49 groups, and the Virgo
cluster core around M87, has been found to arise from mostly old (>~10 Gyr)
metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.0) stars of low-mass progenitor galaxies. New imaging
facilities such as LSST, Euclid, and the `big eyes' on the sky - ELT and JWST
with their advanced instrumentation-promise to greatly increase our knowledge
of the progenitors of the IGL and ICL stars, their ages, metal content, masses

affected by anthropogenic disturbances, such as sounds. Behavioural response
studies are an important approach to quantify the impact of naval activity on
marine mammals. Controlled exposure experiments are undertaken where the
behaviour of animals is quantified before, during, and after exposure to a
controlled sound source, often using telemetry tags (e.g., accelerometers, or
satellite trackers). Statistical modelling is required to formally compare
patterns before and after exposure, to quantify deviations from baseline
behaviour. We propose varying-coefficient stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) as a flexible framework to model such data, with two components: (1)
time-varying baseline dynamics, modelled with non-parametric or random effects
of time-varying covariates, and (2) a non-parametric response model, which
captures deviations from baseline. SDEs are specified in continuous time, which
makes it straightforward to analyse data collected at irregular time intervals,
a common situation for animal tracking studies. We describe how the model can
be embedded into a state-space modelling framework to account for measurement
error. We present inferential methods for model fitting, model checking, and
uncertainty quantification (including on the response model). We apply this
approach to two behavioural response study data sets on beaked whales: a
satellite track, and high-resolution depth data. Our results suggest that the
whales' horizontal movement and vertical diving behaviour changed after
exposure to the sound source, and future work should evaluate the severity and
possible consequences of these responses. These two very different examples
showcase the versatility of varying-coefficient SDEs to measure changes in
behaviour, and we discuss implications of disturbances for the whales'

paradigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image or video by introducing
an additional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods
mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from
reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images.
However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between
input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g., scale and rotation)
and the resolution gap (e.g., HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we
propose C2-Matching in this work, which performs explicit robust matching
crossing transformation and resolution. 1) To bridge the transformation gap, we
propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns
transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image.
2) To address the resolution gap, we adopt teacher-student correlation
distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide
the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation
module to address the potential misalignment issue between input images and
reference images. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of
Reference-based Image Super-Resolution under a realistic setting, we contribute
the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage
scenario. We also extend C2-Matching to Reference-based Video Super-Resolution
task, where an image taken in a similar scene serves as the HR reference image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly
outperforms state of the arts on the standard CUFED5 benchmark and also boosts
the performance of video SR by incorporating the C2-Matching component into

the SPR phenomenon for sensing application, the metal surface is functionalized
with suitable ligands. Although such functionalization can enhance the specific
adsorption capability of the sensor however due to large thickness of the
ligands, the plasmonic field of the metal surface becomes less sensitive
towards the adsorption of analytes. In the next generation SPR based sensor,
graphene can be utilized not only as plasmonic material but also a suitable
ligand for attracting analytes through {\pi}-{\pi} interaction. In this
article, we present our theoretical simulation studies on the observation of
SPR phenomenon using graphene monolayer (MLG), bilayer graphene (BLG) and
in-plane twisted layers of BLG (T-BLG) as plasmonic materials deposited over
Zinc-Selenide substrate. The Kretschmann configuration under wavelength
interrogation setup was simulated and SPR wavelength for graphene systems/water
interface was estimated. The bio-sensing simulation was performed and the
sensing parameters viz. sensitivity, figure-of-merit (FOM) and plasmonic field
for different graphene systems were obtained. Interestingly, the excellent
sensing parameters were found in T-BLG system with relative in-plane twist
angle near to magic angle viz. 1o. The enhancement is due to strong coupling
between the layers twisted at the magic angle. This study demonstrates that the
monolayer, bilayer and twisted bilayer graphene can be employed as a standalone
layer system for not only generation of plasmonic fields but also enhanced
sensing due to its intrinsic pi-pi interactions with bio-analytes.

such exquisite selectivity using artificial solid-state channels. Although,
there are several nanoporous membranes that show high selectivity with respect
to certain ions, the underlying mechanisms are based on the hydrated ion size
and/or charge. There is a need to rationalize the design of artificial channels
to make them capable of selecting between similar-size same-charge ions, which
in turn requires understanding of why and how such selectivity can occur. To
address this issue, we study angstrom-scale artificial channels made by van der
Waals assembly, which are comparable in size with typical ions and carry little
residual charge on channel walls. This allows us to exclude the first-order
effects of steric and Coulomb-based exclusion. We show that the studied
two-dimensional angstrom-scale capillaries can distinguish between same-charge
ions with similar hydrated diameters. The selectivity is attributed to
different positions occupied by ions within the layered structure of
nanoconfined water, which depend on the ion-core size and differ for anions and

Robustly Influencing Latent Intent. RILI first embeds low-level robot
observations into predictions of the human's latent strategy and strategy
dynamics. Next, RILI harnesses these predictions to select actions that
influence the adaptive human towards advantageous, high reward behaviors over
repeated interactions. We demonstrate that -- given RILI's measured performance
with users sampled from an underlying distribution -- we can probabilistically
bound RILI's expected performance across new humans sampled from the same
distribution. Our simulated experiments compare RILI to state-of-the-art
representation and reinforcement learning baselines, and show that RILI better
learns to coordinate with imperfect, noisy, and time-varying agents. Finally,
we conduct two user studies where RILI co-adapts alongside actual humans in a
game of tag and a tower-building task. See videos of our user studies here:

compact object in the system. It is believed that in some cases a momentum kick
is imparted to the newly born object, changing the orbital parameters of the
binary, such as eccentricity and orbital period, and even acquiring an
asynchronous orbit between its components. In this situation, tides play a
central role in the evolution of these binaries. In this work we aim to study
how the orbital parameters of a massive binary change after the formation of a
compact object when the stellar spin of the non-degenerate companion is not
aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We used MESA, which we modified to
be able to evolve binaries with different values of the inclination between the
orbital planes before and just after the formation of the compact object. These
modifications to the equations solved by the MESA code are extended to the case
of non-solid body rotation. We find that the impact of having different initial
inclinations is mostly present in the evolution towards an equilibrium state
that is independent of the inclination. If the binary separation is small
enough such that the interaction happens when the star is burning hydrogen in
its core, this state is reached before the beginning of a mass-transfer phase,
while for a wider binary not all conditions characterizing the equilibrium are
met. These findings show that including the inclination in the equations of
tidal evolution to a binary after a kick is imparted onto a newly born compact
object changes the evolution of some parameters, such as the eccentricity and
the spin period of the star, depending on how large this inclination is.
Moreover, these results can be used to match the properties of observed X-ray
binaries to estimate the strength of the momentum kick.

distinct regularization methods to overcome the challenge posed by the
repulsive electron-electron RK potential in the numerical solution of the
Faddeev equations in momentum space. The first method regulates the repulsive
interaction in the infrared region, while the second regulates it in the
ultraviolet region. By extrapolating the trion energy to the situation without
screening, the two methods gave consistent results for the MoS$_2$ layer with a
trion binding energy of $-49.5(1)$~meV for the exciton energy of $-753.3$~meV.
We analyzed the trion structure for the RK and Yamaguchi potentials in detail,
showing their overall similarities and the dominant cluster structure, where
the strongly bound exciton is weakly bound to an electron. We found that this
property is manifested in the dominance of two of the Faddeev components over

purpose, we use cut and paste approach to eliminate the central singularity and
event horizons of the black hole geometry. Then, we explore the stability of
the developed model by considering different types of matter distribution
located at thin-shell, i.e., barotropic model and variable equations of state
(phantomlike variable and Chaplygin variable models). We use linearized radial

is interesting to mention that Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""om black
holes show the unstable configuration for such type of matter distribution
while Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole with nonlinear electrodynamics expresses
stable regions. It is found that the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics
gives the possibility of a stable structure for barotropic as well as variable

considering higher negative values of coupling constant $\alpha$ and the real

bacteria and algae, have garnered considerable attention over the last decades.
Distinct morphological patterns emerge when bio-colloids undergo drying, with
significant potential in a range of biomedical applications, spanning
bio-sensing, medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and antimicrobial resistance.
This review presents a comprehensive overview of bio-colloidal droplets drying
on solid substrates, focusing on the experimental progress during the last ten
years. We provide a summary of the relevant properties of bio-colloids and link
their composition (constituent particles, solvent, and concentrations) to the
patterns emerging due to drying. We examined the drying patterns generated by
passive bio-colloids (DNA, globular, fibrous, and composite proteins, plasma,
serum, blood, urine, tears, saliva). This article highlights how morphological
patterns are influenced by the nature of the biological entities and the
solvent, micro- and global environmental conditions. Correlations between
emergent patterns and the initial droplet compositions enable the detection of
potential clinical abnormalities when compared with the patterns of drying
droplets of healthy control samples, offering a diagnostic blueprint. Recent
experimental investigations of pattern formation in the bio-mimetic and
salivary drying droplets, relevant to COVID-19 are also presented. Finally, we
summarize the role of biologically active agents in drying process, including
bacteria and algae during the drying process. The review concludes with a
perspective on the next generation of research and applications based on drying

interface of physics, biology, data sciences, and machine learning.

first-person-view (FPV) quadrotor to conduct aggressive aerial tracking. There
are three major challenges to maneuvering an underactuated vehicle using IBVS:
(i) finding a visual feature representation that is robust to large rotations
and is suited to be an optimization variable; (ii) keeping the target visible
without sacrificing the robot's agility; and (iii) compensating for the
rotational effects in the detected features. We propose a complete design
framework to address these problems. First, we employ a rotation on $SO(3)$ to
represent a spherical image feature on $S^{2}$ to gain singularity-free and
second-order differentiable properties. To ensure target visibility, we
formulate the IBVS as a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem with
three constraints taken into account: the robot's physical limits, target
visibility, and time-to-collision (TTC). Furthermore, we propose a novel
attitude-compensation scheme to enable formulating the visibility constraint in
the actual image plane instead of a virtual fix-orientation image plane. It
guarantees that the visibility constraint is valid under large rotations.
Extensive experimental results show that our method can track a fast-moving
target stably and aggressively without the aid of a localization system.

anonymization, which scrubs PII completely, destroyed too much of the structure
of the data to be interesting for the data challenge. We instead chose to
pseudonymize the dataset to reduce its linkability to users' identities.
Pseudonymization is significantly more computationally expensive than
anonymization, and the size of our dataset, approximately 175 million lines of

reused on different HPC machines. We demonstrate the scaling behavior of the
workflow on two leadership class HPC systems at OLCF, and we show that we were

scales linearly in the applied control field, independent of the coupling
strength and environment spectral features. By contrast, a richer thermometric
response can be realized for Kondo impurities, since strong probe-environment
entanglement can then develop. At low temperatures, we uncover a regime with a
universal thermometric response that is independent of microscopic details,
controlled only by the low-energy spectral features of the environment. The
many-body entanglement that develops in this regime means that low-temperature
thermometry with a weakly applied control field is inherently less sensitive,
while optimal sensitivity is recovered by suppressing the entanglement with
stronger fields.

$a$, where $\bar{g}(1/a)$ is the running coupling at renormalisation scale

any positive or negative value, but is computable by next-to-leading order

galaxies (e.g., with Ly${\alpha}$ line widths corresponding to those typical of
AGN or star-forming galaxies). We compute the spatial-frequency diffusion and
the polarization of the Ly${\alpha}$ photons scattered by atomic hydrogen. Our
scattering-only model reproduces the typical size of Ly${\alpha}$ nebulae
($\sim 100\,$kpc) at total column densities $N_{\rm HI} \geq 10^{20} \rm
cm^{-2}$ and predicts a range of positive, flat, and negative polarization
radial gradients. We also find two general classes of Ly${\alpha}$ nebula
morphologies: with and without bright cores. Cores are seen when $N_{\rm HI}$
is low, i.e., when the central source is directly visible, and are associated
with a polarization jump, a steep increase in the polarization radial profile
just outside the halo center. Of all the parameters tested in our smooth or
clumpy medium model, $N_{\rm HI}$ dominates the trends. The radial behaviors of
the Ly${\alpha}$ surface brightness, spectral line shape, and polarization in
the clumpy model with covering factor $f_c \gtrsim 5$ approach those of the
smooth model at the same $N_{\rm HI}$. A clumpy medium with high $N_{\rm HI}$
and low $f_c \lesssim 2$ generates Ly${\alpha}$ features via scattering that
the smooth model cannot: a bright core, symmetric line profile, and
polarization jump.

implement effective preventive strategies to guarantee their proper

Experimental results show that our detector not only outperforms all previous

Nevertheless, health care datasets can still be affected by data bias. Due to
data bias, they provide a distorted view of reality, leading to wrong analysis
results and, consequently, decisions. For example, in a clinical trial that
studied the risk of cardiovascular diseases, predictions were wrong due to the
lack of data on ethnic minorities. It is, therefore, of paramount importance
for researchers to acknowledge data bias that may be present in the datasets
they use, eventually adopt techniques to mitigate them and control if and how
analyses results are impacted. This paper proposes a method to address bias in
datasets that: (i) defines the types of data bias that may be present in the
dataset, (ii) characterizes and quantifies data bias with adequate metrics,
(iii) provides guidelines to identify, measure, and mitigate data bias for
different data sources. The method we propose is applicable both for
prospective and retrospective clinical trials. We evaluate our proposal both
through theoretical considerations and through interviews with researchers in
the health care environment.

Kuramoto-type model with lossy couplings. Kuramoto models have been used to
gain insight on the stability of power networks which are usually nonlinear and
involve large scale interconnections. Such models commonly assume lossless
couplings and Lyapunov functions have predominantly been employed to prove
stability. However, coupling conductances can impact synchronization. We
therefore consider a more advanced Kuramoto model that includes coupling
conductances, and is characterized by nonhomogeneous coupling weights and
noncomplete coupling graphs. Lyapunov analysis once such coupling conductances
and aforementioned properties are included becomes nontrivial and more
conventional energy-like Lyapunov functions are not applicable or are
conservative. Small-signal analysis has been performed for such models, but due
to the fact that we have convergence to a manifold, stability analysis via a
linearization is on its own inconclusive for the nonlinear model. In this
paper, we provide a formal derivation using centre manifold theory that if a
particular condition on the equilibrium point associated with the coupling
conductances and susceptances holds, then the synchronization manifold for the
nonlinear system considered is asymptotically stable. Our analysis is
demonstrated with simulations.

degrades the performance of edge AI systems and may introduce system failures.
To address this gap, retraining of neural network models triggered by concept
drift detection is a practical approach. However, since available compute

fully sequential concept drift detection method in cooperation with an
on-device sequential learning technique of neural networks. In this case, both
the neural network retraining and the proposed concept drift detection are done
only by sequential computation to reduce computation cost and memory
utilization. Evaluation results of the proposed approach shows that while the
accuracy is decreased by 3.8%-4.3% compared to existing batch-based detection
methods, it decreases the memory size by 88.9%-96.4% and the execution time by
1.3%-83.8%. As a result, the combination of the neural network retraining and

  Attention Mechanism Can Help?",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The behavior of the network and its stability are governed by both dynamics
of individual nodes as well as their topological interconnections. Attention
mechanism as an integral part of neural network models was initially designed
for natural language processing (NLP), and so far, has shown excellent
performance in combining dynamics of individual nodes and the coupling
strengths between them within a network. Despite undoubted impact of attention
mechanism, it is not yet clear why some nodes of a network get higher attention
weights. To come up with more explainable solutions, we tried to look at the
problem from stability perspective. Based on stability theory, negative
connections in a network can create feedback loops or other complex structures
by allowing information to flow in the opposite direction. These structures
play a critical role in the dynamics of a complex system and can contribute to
abnormal synchronization, amplification, or suppression. We hypothesized that
those nodes that are involved in organizing such structures can push the entire
network into instability modes and therefore need higher attention during
analysis. To test this hypothesis, attention mechanism along with spectral and
topological stability analyses was performed on a real-world numerical problem,
i.e., a linear Multi Input Multi Output state-space model of a piezoelectric
tube actuator. The findings of our study suggest that the attention should be
directed toward the collective behaviour of imbalanced structures and
polarity-driven structural instabilities within the network. The results
demonstrated that the nodes receiving more attention cause more instability in
the system. Our study provides a proof of concept to understand why perturbing
some nodes of a network may cause dramatic changes in the network dynamics.

line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in

starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20 Mpc. Here we combine
near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO (1-0, 2-1 and 4-3)
and [CI](1-0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via R42 =
I_CO(4-3)/I_CO(2-1) and R21 = I_CO(2-1)/I_CO(1-0) and dissociation via RCICO =
I_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) at 330 pc resolution. We find that the gas flowing into
the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by
stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower R42) and increased
signatures of dissociation (higher RCICO) in the downstream regions. There,
radiative transfer modeling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases
and temperature and [CI/CO] abundance ratio increase. We compare R42 and RCICO
with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with
near-IR 2 um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3 um) and dust
continuum (21 um) emission. In general, RCICO exhibits ~ 0.1 dex tighter
correlations than R42, suggesting CI to be a more sensitive tracer of changing
physical conditions in the NGC 1365 starburst than CO (4-3). Our results are
consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the

dissociate the gas.

  Conditions","11 pages, 9 figures",,,,"eess.IV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background and Objective: The strong demand for medical imaging applications
leads to the popularity of the CT reconstruction problem. Researchers proposed
multiple constraints to tackle none ideal factors in CT reconstruction such as
sparse-view, limited-angle, and low-dose conditions. Most of these constraints
such as total variation are local constraints focusing on the relationship
between a pixel and its neighbors. In this paper, we propose a new constraint
utilizing the global prior of CT images to greatly reduce the streak artifacts
and further improve the reconstruction accuracy. Methods: A CT image of the
human body contains a limited number of different types of tissues, so pixels
in CT images can be grouped into several groups according to their
corresponding types. In our work, we focus on the composition classification
for individual pixels and utilize it as a global prior, which differs from
priors utilized by most current constraints. We propose segmenting pixels based
on their gray levels during the reconstruction process, and forcing pixels in
the same group to have similar gray levels. Results: Our experiments on the
Shepp-Logan phantom and two real CT images from different benchmarks show that
the proposed constraint can help the conventional local constraints further
improve the reconstruction results under sparse-view, limited-angle, and
low-dose conditions. Conclusions: Different from most current constraints
focusing on the local prior, our proposed constraint only utilizes the global
prior of CT images. In that case, our proposed constraint can collaborate with
most local constraints and improve the reconstruction quality significantly.
Furthermore, the proposed constraint also has the potential for further
improvement, as the composition classification can be done with some more
delicate methods, such as neural network related semantic segmentation
algorithms.

bodies' velocities reach a large fraction of the speed of light and the
gravitational-wave luminosity peaks, provides a unique opportunity to probe
gravity in the dynamical and nonlinear regime. How much do the predictions of
general relativity differ from the ones in other theories of gravity for this
stage of the binary evolution? To address this question, we develop a
parametrized waveform model, within the effective-one-body formalism, that
allows for deviations from general relativity in the plunge-merger-ringdown
stage. As first step, we focus on nonprecessing-spin, quasicircular black-hole
binaries. In comparison to previous works, for each gravitational wave mode,
our model can modify, with respect to general-relativistic predictions, the
instant at which the amplitude peaks, the instantaneous frequency at this time
instant, and the value of the peak amplitude. We use this waveform model to
explore several questions considering both synthetic-data injections and two
gravitational wave signals. In particular, we find that deviations from the
peak gravitational wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency can be
constrained to about $20\%$ with GW150914. Alarmingly, we find that
GW200129_065458 shows a strong violation of general relativity. We interpret
this result as a false violation, either due to waveform systematics
(mismodeling of spin precession) or due to data-quality issues depending on
one's interpretation of this event. This illustrates the use of parametrized
waveform models as tools to investigate systematic errors in plain general
relativity. The results with GW200129_065458 also vividly demonstrate the
importance of waveform systematics and of glitch mitigation procedures when
interpreting tests of general relativity with current gravitational wave
observations.

  Security Aspects",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Communications systems to date are primarily designed with the goal of
reliable transfer of digital sequences (bits). Next generation (NextG)
communication systems are beginning to explore shifting this design paradigm to
reliably executing a given task such as in task-oriented communications. In
this paper, wireless signal classification is considered as the task for the
NextG Radio Access Network (RAN), where edge devices collect wireless signals
for spectrum awareness and communicate with the NextG base station (gNodeB)
that needs to identify the signal label. Edge devices may not have sufficient
processing power and may not be trusted to perform the signal classification
task, whereas the transfer of signals to the gNodeB may not be feasible due to
stringent delay, rate, and energy restrictions. Task-oriented communications is
considered by jointly training the transmitter, receiver and classifier
functionalities as an encoder-decoder pair for the edge device and the gNodeB.
This approach improves the accuracy compared to the separated case of signal
transfer followed by classification. Adversarial machine learning poses a major
security threat to the use of deep learning for task-oriented communications. A
major performance loss is shown when backdoor (Trojan) and adversarial
(evasion) attacks target the training and test processes of task-oriented
communications.

cycle construction helps to improve the style transfer ability of the model by
rebuilding transferred sentences back to original-style sentences, it brings
about a content loss in unsupervised text style transfer tasks. In this paper,
we propose a novel disentanglement-based style transfer model StyleFlow to
enhance content preservation. Instead of the typical encoder-decoder scheme,
StyleFlow can not only conduct the forward process to obtain the output, but
also infer to the input through the output. We design an attention-aware
coupling layers to disentangle the content representations and the style
representations of a sentence. Besides, we propose a data augmentation method

results demonstrate that our model preserves content effectively and achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on the most metrics.

help in the prediction of phenomenologically accessible information (also
useful for the followers of the Copenhagen theory). As a first example, we will
see how a Stochastic Schr\""odinger Equation, when used to compute the reduced
density matrix of a non-Markovian open quantum system, necessarily seems to
employ the Bohmian concept of a conditional wavefunction. We will see that by
dressing these conditional wavefunctions with an interpretation, the Bohmian

a high-frequency electron transport model. As a second example, we will
introduce how a Copenhagen ""observable operator"" can be derived from numerical
properties of the Bohmian trajectories, which within Bohmian mechanics, are
well-defined even for an ""unmeasured"" system. Most importantly in practice,
even if these numbers are given no ontological meaning, not only we will be
able to simulate (thus, predict and talk about) them, but we will see that they
can be operationally determined in a weak value experiment. Therefore, they
will be practical numbers to characterize a quantum system irrespective of the

tall and short crops. In the current study, we leverage GEDI to develop
wall-to-wall maps of short vs tall crops on a global scale at 10 m resolution

classified into tall and short crops after removing shots with extreme view
angles or topographic slope, (2) the frequency of tall crops over time can be
used to identify months when tall crops are at their peak height, and (3) GEDI
shots in these months can then be used to train random forest models that use
Sentinel-2 time series to accurately predict short vs. tall crops. Independent
reference data from around the world are then used to evaluate these GEDI-S2
maps. We find that GEDI-S2 performed nearly as well as models trained on
thousands of local reference training points, with accuracies of at least 87%

underestimation of tall crop area was observed in regions where crops
frequently exhibit low biomass, namely Africa and South Asia, and further work
is needed in these systems. Although the GEDI-S2 approach only differentiates
tall from short crops, in many landscapes this distinction goes a long way

fractal or subclustered distribution for each cluster. We computed the
parameters m (which is the average length of the connected segments normalized
by the area), s (which is the mean points separation in units of cluster
radius), and Q (the ratio of these components). These parameters are useful to
distinguish between radial, homogeneous, and substructured distributions of
stars. The dependence of these parameters with the different characteristics of
the clusters, such as their ages and spatial distribution, was also studied. We
found that most of the studied clusters present a homogeneous stellar
distribution or a distribution with a radial concentration. Our results are
consistent with the models, suggesting that more dynamically evolved clusters
seem to have larger Q values, confirming previous results from numerical
simulations. There also seems to be a correlation between the internal
structure of the clusters and their galactocentric distances, in the sense that
for both galaxies, the more distant clusters have larger Q values. We also paid

of natural language, which inherently makes it difficult to estimate the right

have identified a simple, loss-minimising behaviour: to output the unigram

raises the question: Rather than wasting precious compute resources and model
capacity for learning this strategy at early training stages, can we initialise
our models with this behaviour? Here, we show that we can effectively endow our
model with a separate module that reflects unigram frequency statistics as
prior knowledge. Standard neural language generation architectures offer a
natural opportunity for implementing this idea: by initialising the bias term
in a model's final linear layer with the log-unigram distribution. Experiments
in neural machine translation demonstrate that this simple technique: (i)
improves learning efficiency; (ii) achieves better overall performance; and
(iii) appears to disentangle strong frequency effects, encouraging the model to
specialise in non-frequency-related aspects of language.

three highest performing metrics were used to build multivariate models with
leave-one-out validation for Bowel V$_{40Gy}$. Patients with higher initial
bowel doses were correlated with the largest decreases in Bowel V$_{40Gy}$ from
daily adaptation (linear best fit R$^2$=0.77 for a 3mm PTV margin and R$^2$=0.8
for a 5mm PTV margin). Other metrics had intermediate or no correlation.
Selected covariates for the multivariate model were differences in the initial
Bowel V$_{40Gy}$. and Bladder D$_{mean}$ using standard versus reduced margins
and the initial bladder volume. Leave-one-out validation had an R$^2$ of 0.66
between the predicted and true adaptive Bowel V$_{40Gy}$ benefits for both
margins. This work could be used to prospectively triage cervical cancer
patients, and presents a critical foundation for predicting benefits from daily
adaptation that can be extended to other patient cohorts.

twisted bilayer graphene. Here we show that the nontrivial topology reflects in
the Hofstadter spectra, in particular, by displaying a cascade of Hofstadter

perpendicular electric field. Our experiments together with theoretical
calculations suggest a crucial role of charge polarization changing
concomitantly with topological transitions in this system. Layer polarization
is likely to play an important role in the topological states in few-layer

thorough investigation of the generalized on-site charge susceptibility of
several fundamental many-electron models, such as the Hubbard atom, the
Anderson impurity model and the Hubbard model. By decomposing the numerically
determined generalized susceptibility in terms of physically transparent
single-boson exchange processes, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms
responsible for the breakdown of the self-consistent many-electron perturbation
expansion. In particular, we unambiguously identify the origin of the
significant suppression of its diagonal entries in (Matsubara) frequency space
and the slight increase of the off-diagonal ones which cause the breakdown. The
suppression effect on the diagonal elements directly originates from the
electronic scattering on local magnetic moments, reflecting their increasingly
longer lifetime as well as their enhanced effective coupling with the
electrons. The slight and diffuse enhancement of the off-diagonal terms,
instead, can be mostly ascribed to multiboson scattering processes. The strong
intertwining between the spin and charge sector is partly weakened at the Kondo
temperature due to a progressive reduction of the effective spin-fermion
coupling of local magnetic fluctuations in the low frequency regime. Our
analysis, thus, clarifies the precise way in which the physical information
between different scattering channels of interacting electron problems is
transferred and highlights the pivotal role played by such an intertwining in
the physics of correlated electrons beyond the perturbative regime.

so by describing the evolution of the states of individual neurons with a

that is compatible with the nonlinearity and boundedness of the activation
function. Our dynamical system captures the behavior of the high-dimensional
stochastic model even in cases where the mean-field approximation fails to do
so. Taking into account the second-order moments modifies the solutions that
would be obtained with the mean-field approximation, and can lead to the
appearance or disappearance of fixed points and limit cycles. We moreover
perform numerical experiments where the mean-field approximation leads to
periodically oscillating solutions, while the solutions of the second-order

  In absence of any Markovianity, our arguments rely on the recently proven
convergence of geodesics in pre-limiting models to that in the directed
landscape (Dauvergne-Virag '21). However, this input concerns macroscopic
properties and is too coarse to capture the microscopic information required
for local time analysis. To relate the macroscopic and microscopic behavior, a
key ingredient is an a priori smoothness estimate of the local time in the
discrete model, proved relying on geometric ideas such as the coalescence of
geodesics as well as their stability under perturbations of boundary data.

2016blu in NGC 4559. This transient was discovered by the Lick Observatory
Supernova Search in 2012 and has continued its outbursts since then. Optical
and infrared photometry of AT 2016blu reveals at least 19 outbursts in
2012-2022. Similar photometry from 1999-2009 shows no outbursts, indicating
that the star was relatively stable in the decade before discovery. Archival
Hubble Space Telescope observations suggest the progenitor had a minimum
initial mass of M>=33 M$_{\odot}$ and a luminosity of L>=$10^{5.7}$L$_{\odot}$.
AT 2016blu's outbursts show irregular variability with multiple closely spaced
peaks having typical amplitudes of 1-2 mag and durations of 1-4 weeks. While
individual outbursts have irregular light curves, concentrations of these peaks
recur with a period of $\sim 113 \pm 2$ d. Based on this period, we predict
times for upcoming outbursts in 2023 and 2024. AT 2016blu shares similarities
with SN 2000ch in NGC 3432, where outbursts may arise from periastron
encounters in an eccentric binary containing a luminous blue variable (LBV). We
propose that AT 2016blu's outbursts are also driven by interactions that
intensify around periastron in an eccentric system. Intrinsic variability of
the LBV-like primary star may cause different intensity and duration of binary
interaction at each periastron passage. AT 2016blu also resembles the
periastron encounters of $\eta$ Carinae prior to its Great Eruption and the
erratic pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. This similarity and the onset of
eruptions in the past decade hint that AT 2016blu may also be headed for a
catastrophe, making it a target of great interest.

model at inference time given test input(s) from a different target domain.
Most existing TTA approaches assume the setting in which the target domain is
stationary, i.e., all the test inputs come from a single target domain.
However, in many practical settings, the test input distribution might exhibit
a lifelong/continual shift over time. Moreover, existing TTA approaches also
lack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial
when distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain. To address
these issues, we present PETAL (Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation
with seLf-training prior), which solves lifelong TTA using a probabilistic
approach, and naturally results in (1) a student-teacher framework, where the
teacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model, and (2)
regularizing the model updates at inference time using the source model as a
regularizer. To prevent model drift in the lifelong/continual TTA setting, we
also propose a data-driven parameter restoration technique which contributes to
reducing the error accumulation and maintaining the knowledge of recent domains
by restoring only the irrelevant parameters. In terms of predictive error rate
as well as uncertainty based metrics such as Brier score and negative
log-likelihood, our method achieves better results than the current
state-of-the-art for online lifelong test-time adaptation across various
benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNetC, and ImageNet3DCC

and not suffering from so-called barren plateaus that hinder the variational
optimisation of many hardware-efficient ans\""atze. In its standard
implementation, however, it introduces a considerable measurement overhead in
the form of gradient evaluations trough estimations of many commutator
operators. In this work, we mitigate this measurement overhead by exploiting a
recently introduced method for energy evaluation relying on Adaptive
Informationally complete generalised Measurements (AIM). Besides offering an
efficient way to measure the energy itself, Informationally Complete (IC)
measurement data can be reused to estimate all the commutators of the operators
in the operator pool of ADAPT-VQE, using only classically efficient
post-processing. We present the AIM-ADAPT-VQE scheme in detail, and investigate
its performance with several H4 Hamiltonians and operator pools. Our numerical
simulations indicate that the measurement data obtained to evaluate the energy
can be reused to implement ADAPT-VQE with no additional measurement overhead
for the systems considered here. In addition, we show that, if the energy is
measured within chemical precision, the CNOT count in the resulting circuits is
close to the ideal one. With scarce measurement data, AIM-ADAPT-VQE still
converges to the ground state with high probability, albeit with an increased
circuit depth in some cases.

parameter in a model, trading accuracy for smaller memory footprints and
inference latencies. However, the final model size depends on both the number
of parameters of the original model and the rate of compression. For example, a
30B 8-bit model and a 60B 4-bit model have the same number of bits but may have
very different zero-shot accuracies. In this work, we study this trade-off by
developing inference scaling laws of zero-shot performance in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to determine the bit-precision and model size that maximizes
zero-shot performance. We run more than 35,000 experiments with 16-bit inputs
and k-bit parameters to examine which zero-shot quantization methods improve
scaling for 3 to 8-bit precision at scales of 19M to 176B parameters across the
LLM families BLOOM, OPT, NeoX/Pythia, and GPT-2. We find that it is challenging
to improve the bit-level scaling trade-off, with the only improvements being
the use of a small block size -- splitting the parameters into small
independently quantized blocks -- and the quantization data type being used
(e.g., Int vs Float). Overall, our findings show that {4-bit} precision is
almost universally optimal for total model bits and zero-shot accuracy.

LMs with both task instances and their associated free-text rationales (FTRs),
which explain the correct reasoning process for predicting the correct task
output (i.e., how to be ""right for the right reasons""). However, existing
finetuning methods fail to improve LM performance, while prompting needs
prohibitively large (i.e., >50B) LMs to work well. We propose KNIFE, which
shows that reasoning knowledge can be effectively distilled from FTRs into a
small (i.e., <1B) LM and improve the LM's performance. First, KNIFE finetunes a
teacher LM (given task input and FTR) to predict the task output, transferring
reasoning knowledge from the FTRs to the teacher's hidden states. Second, KNIFE
finetunes a student LM (given task input only) such that its hidden states are
aligned with the teacher's. Thus, the student is endowed with reasoning
knowledge but can be used for inference without direct FTR input. On two
question-answering datasets, KNIFE outperforms various finetuning and prompting
baselines in fully-supervised and low-resource settings. Also, we observe that
FTR quality is crucial to KNIFE's performance.

is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). A critical driver
accelerating NER systems' progress is the existence of large-scale language
corpora that enable NER systems to achieve outstanding performance in languages
such as English and French with abundant training data. However, NER for
low-resource languages remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we
introduce Mask Augmented Named Entity Recognition (MANER), a new methodology
that leverages the distributional hypothesis of pre-trained masked language
models (MLMs) for NER. The <mask> token in pre-trained MLMs encodes valuable
semantic contextual information. MANER re-purposes the <mask> token for NER
prediction. Specifically, we prepend the <mask> token to every word in a
sentence for which we would like to predict the named entity tag. During
training, we jointly fine-tune the MLM and a new NER prediction head attached
to each <mask> token. We demonstrate that MANER is well-suited for NER in
low-resource languages; our experiments show that for 100 languages with as few
as 100 training examples, it improves on state-of-the-art methods by up to 48%
and by 12% on average on F1 score. We also perform detailed analyses and
ablation studies to understand the scenarios that are best-suited to MANER.

scalability. On a large scale, it becomes computationally expensive to
aggregate useful information from the entire KG for inference. To address the
limitations of existing KG link prediction frameworks, we propose a novel

for the query and then jointly reasons over the context and the query with a
high-capacity reader. As part of our exemplar instantiation for the new
framework, we propose a novel Transformer-based GNN as the reader, which
incorporates graph-based attention structure and cross-attention between query

ourselves to the use of toy heavy quarks with a large, unphysical mass, in
order to implement the kinetic equations for the angular momentum in the
non-relativistic limit. We find that as a consequence of the anisotropy of the
background fields, angular momentum fluctuations are also anisotropic: we
understand this in simple terms relating the fluctuations of the angular
momentum, $L$, to those of linear momentum. While orbital angular momentum
diffuses and develops substantial fluctuations and anisotropies, the spin does
not. Hence, we can identify the fluctuations of $L$ with those of the total
angular momentum $J=L + S$. Therefore, our study suggests that the total
angular momentum of the heavy quarks in the early stage of high energy nuclear

results, we design a simple multi-task model to control such confounding by
leveraging human-annotated relevant sentences when available. Crucially, we
give a principled characterization of data distributions where such confounding
can be large thereby necessitating the use of human annotated relevant

oil which encapsulates the droplets. The droplets' shapes present are observed
to be more complex than comprehensible from the two-dimensional images from the
experiments. Thus, DNS with FS3D can provide additional information like the
surface area or the velocity contributions in order to find analytical models
of such collision processes in the future. Simulations of such increasingly
complex systems require constant improvement of the numerical solver regarding
the code's performance. Thus, the red-black Gauss-Seidel smoother in the
multi-grid solver, the iterative red-black scheme to compute the viscous forces
as well as the momentum advection method were enhanced with a cache- and memory
usage optimization. An overall performance gain of up to 33% was obtained for a
representative test case.

widely used object detector in VLP. It then reformulates the visual grounding
task into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP by encouraging the model to
predict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given
object, e.g. filling `P"" or ``O"" in aPTP ``The block P has a O"". This mechanism
improves the visual grounding capability of VLP models and thus helps them
better handle various downstream tasks. By introducing PTP into several
state-of-the-art VLP frameworks, we observe consistently significant
improvements across representative cross-modal learning model architectures and

deploying them in situations where the corpus changes over time is
computationally expensive because reindexing the corpus requires re-training
the model. In this work, we introduce DSI++, a continual learning challenge for
DSI to incrementally index new documents while being able to answer queries
related to both previously and newly indexed documents. Across different model
scales and document identifier representations, we show that continual indexing
of new documents leads to considerable forgetting of previously indexed
documents. We also hypothesize and verify that the model experiences forgetting
events during training, leading to unstable learning. To mitigate these issues,
we investigate two approaches. The first focuses on modifying the training
dynamics. Flatter minima implicitly alleviate forgetting, so we optimize for
flatter loss basins and show that the model stably memorizes more documents
(+12\%). Next, we introduce a generative memory to sample pseudo-queries for
documents and supplement them during continual indexing to prevent forgetting
for the retrieval task. Extensive experiments on novel continual indexing
benchmarks based on Natural Questions (NQ) and MS MARCO demonstrate that our
proposed solution mitigates forgetting by a significant margin. Concretely, it

human involvement. To evaluate human-LM interaction, we develop a new
framework, Human-AI Language-based Interaction Evaluation (HALIE), that expands
non-interactive evaluation along three dimensions, capturing (i) the
interactive process, not only the final output; (ii) the first-person
subjective experience, not just a third-party assessment; and (iii) notions of
preference beyond quality. We then design five tasks ranging from goal-oriented
to open-ended to capture different forms of interaction. On four
state-of-the-art LMs (three variants of OpenAI's GPT-3 and AI21's J1-Jumbo), we
find that non-interactive performance does not always result in better human-LM
interaction and that first-person and third-party metrics can diverge,
suggesting the importance of examining the nuances of human-LM interaction.

natural language processing. The classic CoNLL-2003 English dataset, published
almost 20 years ago, is commonly used to train and evaluate named entity
taggers. The age of this dataset raises the question of how well these models
perform when applied to modern data. In this paper, we present CoNLL++, a new
annotated test set that mimics the process used to create the original
CoNLL-2003 test set as closely as possible, except with data collected from
2020. Using CoNLL++, we evaluate the generalization of 20+ different models to
modern data. We observe that different models have very different
generalization behavior. F\textsubscript{1} scores of large transformer-based
models which are pre-trained on recent data dropped much less than models using
static word embeddings, and RoBERTa-based and T5 models achieve comparable
F\textsubscript{1} scores on both CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++. Our experiments show
that achieving good generalizability requires a combined effort of developing
larger models and continuing pre-training with in-domain and recent data. These
results suggest standard evaluation methodology may have under-estimated
progress on named entity recognition over the past 20 years; in addition to
improving performance on the original CoNLL-2003 dataset, we have also improved
the ability of our models to generalize to modern data.

associated to curves on the compactification space contained in generic fibers

in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), by relating the bipartition
to the geometry of an annulus with conformal boundary conditions. In the
presence of extended symmetries such as Kac-Moody type current algebrae,
symmetry resolution is possible only if the boundary conditions on the annulus
preserve part of the symmetry group, i.e. if the factorization map associated
with the spatial bipartition is compatible with the symmetry in question. The
partition function of the boundary CFT (BCFT) is then decomposed in terms of
the characters of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group
preserved by the boundary conditions. We demonstrate that this decomposition
already provides the symmetry resolution of the entanglement spectrum of the
corresponding bipartition. Considering the various terms of the partition
function associated with the same representation, or charge sector, the
symmetry-resolved R\'enyi entropies can be derived to all orders in the UV
cutoff expansion without the need to compute the charged moments. We apply this
idea to the theory of a free massless boson with $U(1)$, $\mathbb{R}$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.

$\log_{10}(M/\text{M}_{\odot}) \sim 10.9$, TN J1338--1942 is confirmed to be
one of the most massive galaxies known at this epoch. Our observations also
reveal extremely high equivalent-width nebular emission coincident with the
luminous AGN jets that is best fit by radiative shocks surrounded by extensive
recent star-formation. We estimate the total star-formation rate (SFR) could be
as high as $\sim1600\,\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, with the SFR that we
attribute to the jet induced burst conservatively
$\gtrsim500\,\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$. The mass-weighted age of the
star-formation, $t_{\text{mass}} <4$ Myr, is consistent with the likely age of
the jets responsible for the triggered activity and significantly younger than
that measured in the core of the host galaxy. The extreme scale of the

are posed to replace widely adopted pseudo and true classical random number
generators in applications such as encryption and gambling, and therefore, need
to be cheap, fast and with integration capabilities. Using a compact
metal-halide PeLED source, we generate random numbers, which are certified to
be secure against an eavesdropper, following the quantum
measurement-device-independent scenario. The obtained random number generation
rate of more than 10 Mbit s$^{-1}$, which is already comparable to actual
commercial devices, shows that PeLEDs can work as high-quality light sources
for quantum information tasks, thus paving the way for future developments of
quantum technologies. Lastly, we argue that the simpler PeLED manufacturing
process, when comparing to solid-state devices, may have large environmental
impacts when quantum technology systems become more mass produced, due to the
possible lower carbon footprint.

described by a power law with slopes $0.7{-}1.2$ and normalization $I_{\rm CO}

and intercepts vary systematically with choice of line and band. The comparison
between the relations measured for CO~(1-0) and CO (2-1) allow us to infer that
$R_{21} \propto I_{\rm MIR}^{0.2}$, in good agreement with other work. The

it a decoupled (2+1)d TO to get another boundary theory. Should one view these
two boundaries as ""different""? A natural choice would be no. Different classes
of gapped boundaries of (3+1)d TO should be defined modulo these decoupled
(2+1)d TOs. But is this enough?
  We examine the possibility of coupling the boundary of a (3+1)d TO to
additional (2+1)d TOs or fractonic systems, which leads to even more
possibilities for gapped boundaries. Typically, the bulk point-like
excitations, when touching the boundary, become excitations in the added (2+1)d
phase, while the string-like excitations in the bulk may end on the boundary
but with endpoints dressed by some other excitations in the (2+1)d phase. For a
good definition of ""class"" for gapped boundaries of (3+1)d TO, we choose to
quotient out the different dressings as well.
  We characterize a class of gapped boundaries by the string-like excitations
that can end on the boundary, whatever their endpoints are. A concrete example
is the (3+1)d bosonic toric code. Using group cohomology and category theory,
three gapped boundaries have been found previously: rough boundary, smooth
boundary and twisted smooth boundary. We can construct many more gapped
boundaries beyond these, which all naturally fall into two classes
corresponding to whether the $m$-string can or cannot end on the boundary.
According to this classification, the previously found three boundaries are
grouped as {rough}, {smooth, twisted smooth}. For a (3+1)d TO characterized by
a finite group $G$, different classes correspond to different subgroups of $G$.
We illustrate the physical picture from various perspectives including coupled
layer construction, Walker-Wang model and field theory.

infallers, infalling galaxies, and interlopers. To understand the effects of
the cluster environment to the evolution of galaxies, we compare across the
five classes: stellar mass, specific star formation rate, size, and morphology.
Following the guidelines of Coenda et al., a separate analysis is carried out
for red and blue galaxies. For red galaxies, cluster galaxies differ from the
other classes, having a suppressed specific star formation rate, smaller sizes,
and are more likely to be classified as ellipticals. Differences are smaller
between the other classes, however backsplash galaxies have significantly lower
specific star formation rates than early or recent infalling galaxies. For blue
galaxies, we find evidence that recent infallers are smaller than infalling
galaxies and interlopers, while the latter two are comparable in size. Our
results provide evidence that, after a single passage, the cluster environment
can diminish a galaxy's star formation, modify its morphology, and can also
reduce in size blue galaxies. We find evidence that quenching occurs faster
than morphological transformation from spirals to ellipticals for all classes.
While quenching is evidently enhanced as soon as galaxies get into clusters,
significant morphological transformations require galaxies to experience the
action of the physical mechanisms of the cluster for longer timescales.

use a modified version of the two-point cross-correlation function and a
measure of the angle between the semi-major axes of the central galaxies and
the larger structures. Overall, our results reproduce observational ones, as we
find large-scale anisotropy, which is dominated by the red central galaxies. In
addition, the latter is noticeably more aligned with their group than the blue
ones. In contrast to the observations, we find a strong dependence of the
anisotropy on the central galaxy with mass, probably associated with the
inability of observational methods to determine them. This result allows us to
link the alignment to the process of halo assembly and the well-known
dependence of halo anisotropy on mass. When we include the dark matter
distribution in our analysis, we conclude that the galaxy alignment found in
simulations (and observations) can be explained by a combination of physical
processes at different scales: the central galaxy aligns with the dark matter
halo it inhabits, and this, in turn, aligns with the surrounding structures at
large scales.

understood to be limited towards very early phase of the universe, namely in
the pre-inflationary era, with limited signatures remaining present in the
succeeding inflationary era. These signatures also gradually fade away as the
universe grows and exits the inflationary era. In the subsequent radiation and
matter dominated era quantum gravity is expected to play no significant role.
Classicalized primordial perturbations such as the scalar perturbations and the
gravitational waves are expected to leave an imprint on CMB anisotropy and its
polarization respectively but quantized gravitational waves are not expected to
lead to any appreciable observable effects. Apart from cosmology, in other
avenues as well, the imprints of quantum character of gravitational waves are
typically so subdued that any possible signature gets buried under a huge pile
of the noise or effects from other much stronger processes. In this work, we
demonstrate that quantum gravity perturbations cause strong observable effects
in cosmological settings post the Last Scattering Surface (LSS) more
prominently than any other classical or quantum processes. This
counter-intuitive effect is facilitated by the fact that the correlators of the
gravitational waves {\it grow divergently large in the matter dominated era}
unlike any other background fields, leading to an abrupt rise in the processes
mediated by correlators of quantum gravitons. The transitions between spherical
harmonics states of newly formed hydrogen atom at the LSS, when the universe
resides in strong matter dominated era, provides an example of such a process.
We further establish that the late time epoch just before the kicking in of the
dark energy provides one of the cleanest avenues to study such quantum gravity
effects.

to understand the notorious quantum-to-classical transition. A pivotal role in
this approach is played by, so called, pointer states which are quantum states
least affected by the environment and are ``carriers"" of classical behavior. We
develop here a general method on how to find pointer states. Working within the
Born-Markov approximation, we combine methods of group theory and open quantum
systems to derive explicit equations describing pointer states. They contain
variances squared of certain operators, thus resembling the defining equations
of coherent states, but are in general different from the latter. This shows
that two notions of being ``the closest to the classical"" -- one defined by the
uncertainty relations and the other by the interaction with the environment --
are in general different. As an example, we study arbitrary spin-$J$ systems
interacting with bosonic or spin thermal environments and find explicitly
pointer states for $J=1$.

to host flat bands (FBs). However, the observed FBs are non-ideal as they are
not flat over the whole 2D Brillouin zone and overlap strongly with other
bands. Most critically, the theoretical conditions for the existence of ideal
FB in Kagome metals, beyond the simplest Kagome lattice model, are unknown.
Here, based on tight-binding model analyses of the interplay between d-orbital
symmetry and underlying Kagome lattice symmetry, we establish such conditions.
We show that for a pure transition-metal (TM) Kagome lattice, only dz2 orbital
gives rise to a FB; while dxy, dx2-y2, dxz, and dyz orbitals do not. The
condition for the latter four orbitals to produce a FB is to rotate them so
that they will conform with the underlying Kagome lattice symmetry.
Interestingly, the lattice having rotated dxy (dxz) and dx2-y2 (dyz) orbitals
leads to a FB of opposite chirality sitting above and below the Dirac bands,
respectively. For intercalated TM Kagome lattices, the Kagome-hexagonal
intercalation exhibits always a FB, while the case for the Kagome-trigonal
intercalation is conditional. Another condition to isolate the FB arising from
individual d-orbitals is to increase the crystal field splitting, such as in
Kagome metals of layered metalorganic frameworks.

little is understood about how the training dynamics change as models get
larger. How do language models of different sizes learn during pre-training?
Why do larger language models demonstrate more desirable behaviors? In this
paper, we analyze the intermediate training checkpoints of differently sized
OPT models (Zhang et al.,2022)--from 125M to 175B parameters--on next-token
prediction, sequence-level generation, and downstream tasks. We find that 1) at
a given perplexity and independent of model sizes, a similar subset of training
tokens see the most significant reduction in loss, with the rest stagnating or
showing double-descent behavior; 2) early in training, all models learn to
reduce the perplexity of grammatical sequences that contain hallucinations,
with small models halting at this suboptimal distribution and larger ones
eventually learning to assign these sequences lower probabilities; 3)
perplexity is a strong predictor of in-context learning performance on 74
multiple-choice tasks from BIG-Bench, and this holds independent of the model
size. Together, these results show that perplexity is more predictive of model
behaviors than model size or training computation.

  cosmological model with a non-standard sound horizon","20 pages, 8 figures, Fig. 1 may be a useful summary of the recent
  measurements of the spatial curvature",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spatial curvature is one of the most fundamental parameters in our current
concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM model of the Universe. The goal of this work is
to investigate how the constraint on the spatial curvature is affected by an
assumption on the sound horizon scale. The sound horizon is an essential
quantity to use the standard ruler from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). As an example, we study the curvature
constraint in an axion-like Early Dark Energy (EDE) model in light of recent
cosmological datasets from Planck, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), as well as BAO data compiled in Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16. We find that, independent of the CMB
datasets, the EDE model parameters are constrained only by the CMB power
spectra as precisely and consistently as the flat case in previous work, even
with the spatial curvature. We also demonstrate that combining CMB with BAO is
extremely powerful to constrain the curvature parameter even with a reduction
of the sound-horizon scale in an EDE model, resulting in $\Omega_K=-0.0056\pm
0.0031$ in the case of ACT+BAO after marginalizing over the parameters of the
EDE model. This constraint is as competitive as the Planck+BAO result in a
$\Lambda$CDM model, $\Omega_{K}=-0.0001\pm 0.0018$.

effectively occupies a spatial region of infrared (IR) scaling dimension
$d_\text{IR} \approx 8/3$. Here we inquire about the dimensional substructure
involved. We partition space into regions of equal quantum occurrence
probability, such that points comprising a region are of similar relevance, and
calculate the IR scaling dimension $d$ of each. This allows us to infer the
probability density $p(d)$ for dimension $d$ to be accessed by electron. We
find that $p(d)$ has a strong peak at $d$ very close to 2. In fact, our data
suggests that $p(d)$ is non-zero on the interval $[d_\text{min}, d_\text{max}]
\approx [4/3,8/3]$ and may develop a discrete part ($\delta$-function) at $d=2$
in infinite-volume limit. The latter invokes the possibility that combination
of quantum mechanics and pure disorder can lead to emergence of topological
dimensions. Although $d_\text{IR}$ is based on effective counting of which
$p(d)$ has no a priori knowledge, $d_\text{IR} \ge d_\text{max}$ is an exact
feature of the ensuing formalism. Possible connection of our results to recent
findings of $d_\text{IR} \approx 2$ in Dirac near-zero modes of thermal quantum
chromodynamics is emphasized.

particularly suitable for the simulation of a pixelated charge readout for time
projection chambers, given the large number of channels that this technology

simulator of a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) equipped with
light readout and pixelated charge readout, developed for the DUNE Near
Detector. The software is implemented with an end-to-end set of GPU-optimized
algorithms. The algorithms have been written in Python and translated into CUDA
kernels using Numba, a just-in-time compiler for a subset of Python and NumPy
instructions. The GPU implementation achieves a speed up of four orders of
magnitude compared with the equivalent CPU version. The simulation of the
current induced on $10^3$ pixels takes around 1 ms on the GPU, compared with
approximately 10 s on the CPU. The results of the simulation are compared
against data from a pixel-readout LArTPC prototype.

networks are almost unavoidable in areas where we wish to deploy multi-robotic

structure. We tackle this problem by modeling the broadcast of information in a
multi-robot communication network as a stochastic process with random arrival
times, which can be produced by irregular robot movements, wireless
attenuation, and other environmental factors. Using this model, we provide and
analyze a receding horizon control strategy to control the statistics of the
information broadcast. The resulting strategy compels the robots to re-direct
their communication resources to different neighbors according to the current
propagation process to fulfill global broadcast requirements. Based on this
method, we provide an approach to compute the expected time to broadcast the
message to all nodes. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the
results.

In this paper, we introduce new infinite Ramanujan type congruences modulo $2$

and involve primes in $\mathcal P=\{p \text{ prime } : \exists \, j\in

$p\nmid m$ and $pm\equiv 1\pmod{24}$, is divisible by $8$. Here, the difficulty
arises from the fact that $216$ is not idoneal. We also give a conjectural
exact formula for the number of solutions for this Diophantine equation. In the
second part of the article, we study reversals of Euler-type identities. These
are motivated by recent work of the second author on a reversal of Schur's

are a way to drastically increase model capacity without the need for a

of such a model. It covers 202 languages but requires at least four 32GB GPUs
just for inference. In this work, we propose a pruning method that allows the
removal of up to 80\% of experts with a negligible loss in translation quality,
which makes it feasible to run the model on a single 32GB GPU. Further analysis
suggests that our pruning metrics allow to identify language-specific experts

jump process and we regulate the mean and variance of such a process. The main
contributions of this paper are: Establishing a structure for the transition
rates of the equivalent stochastic jump process and formally showing that this
approach leads to decoupled parameters that allow us to adjust the first- and
second-order moments of the ensemble distribution over tasks, which gives the
flexibility to decrease the variance in the desired final distribution. This
allows us to directly shape the impact of uncertainties on the group allocation
over tasks. We introduce a detailed procedure to design the gains to achieve
the desired mean and show how the additional parameters impact the covariance
matrix, which is directly associated with the degree of task allocation
precision. Our simulation and experimental results illustrate the successful
control of several robot ensembles during task allocation.

avoids modeling the covariate distribution. However, most existing CML-based
methods use only the Phase 2 sample and thus may be less efficient than other
methods. We propose a general empirical likelihood method that uses CML

estimation efficiency. The proposed method maintains the ability to handle zero
selection probabilities and avoids modeling the covariate distribution, but can
lead to substantial efficiency gains over CML in the inexpensive covariates, or
in the influential covariate when a surrogate is available, because of an

the parametrization of the matrix elements into Lorentz-invariant amplitudes.
The amplitudes can then be related to the standard light-cone GPDs.
  GPDs are defined in the symmetric frame, which requires a separate
calculation for each value of the momentum transfer, increasing the
computational cost significantly. The proposed method is powerful, as one can
extract the GPDs at multiple values of the momentum transfer at the
computational cost of a single value. For this proof-of-concept calculation, we
use one ensemble of $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions and a clover improvement

sufficient condition for the presence of arithmetic progressions with length
$\ell+1$ and restricted differences in dense subsets of integers. These results
are a consequence of the following general theorem: in order to verify that a
multiple ergodic average is controlled by the degree $d$ Gowers-Host-Kra

documents as they govern the obligations and entitlements of the various

legalese resulting in lots of manual hours spent in understanding them. In this
paper, we address the task of summarizing legal contracts for each of the
contracting parties, to enable faster reviewing and improved understanding of
them. Specifically, we collect a dataset consisting of pairwise importance
comparison annotations by legal experts for ~293K sentence pairs from lease
agreements. We propose a novel extractive summarization system to automatically
produce a summary consisting of the most important obligations, entitlements,
and prohibitions in a contract. It consists of two modules: (1) a content
categorize to identify sentences containing each of the categories (i.e.,
obligation, entitlement, and prohibition) for a party, and (2) an importance
ranker to compare the importance among sentences of each category for a party
to obtain a ranked list. The final summary is produced by selecting the most
important sentences of a category for each of the parties. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed system by comparing it against several text
ranking baselines via automatic and human evaluation.

in biomedicine. To improve efficiency, these techniques may employ landmark
samplers. The heuristic maxmin procedure obtains a roughly even distribution of
sample points by implicitly constructing a cover comprising sets of uniform
radius. However, issues arise with data that vary in density or include points
with multiplicities, as are common in biomedicine. We propose an analogous
procedure, ""lastfirst"" based on ranked distances, which implies a cover
comprising sets of uniform cardinality. We first rigorously define the
procedure and prove that it obtains landmarks with desired properties. We then
perform benchmark tests and compare its performance to that of maxmin, on
feature detection and class prediction tasks involving simulated and real-world
biomedical data. Lastfirst is more general than maxmin in that it can be
applied to any data on which arbitrary (and not necessarily symmetric) pairwise
distances can be computed. Lastfirst is more computationally costly, but our
implementation scales at the same rate as maxmin. We find that lastfirst
achieves comparable performance on prediction tasks and outperforms maxmin on
homology detection tasks. Where the numerical values of similarity measures are
not meaningful, as in many biomedical contexts, lastfirst sampling may also
improve interpretability.

generate a large current without dissipation. This raises interest about the
generation mechanisms for these currents inside the defect. This question is
analyzed here by studying the inverse photoelectric effect for these objects

a massive boson by the extended defect. Another motivation for the present work
is that there exists a discussion in condensed matter about the role of the
bound spectrum in the macroscopic Magnus force that the vortex experiences in
certain type of superfluids or superconductors. The discussion is about wether
the main force comes from scattering of these fermions by the object or by the

We show that this ansatz constitutes a working scenario for spacetime emergence

structure of different types of models in the field theoretic landscape.
Proposals in this direction include attempts to directly characterize the
formal structure of the theory by considering complexity measures of the
potentials. An alternative intrinsic approach is to focus on the behavior of
the observables that result from different models and to ask whether their
behavior differs among models. This type of analysis can be applied even to
nontrivial multifield theories where a natural measure of the complexity of the
model is not obvious and the analytical evaluation of the observables is often
impossible. In such cases one may still compute these observables numerically
and investigate their behavior. One interesting case is when observables show a
scaling behavior, in which case theories can be characterized in terms of their
scaling amplitudes and exponents. Generically, models have nontrivial parameter
spaces, leading to exponents that are functions of these parameters. In such
cases we consider an iterative procedure to determine whether the exponent
functions in turn lead to a scaling behavior. We show that modular inflation
models can be characterized by families of simple scaling laws and that the
scaling exponents that arise in this way in turn show a scaling law in
dependence of these varying energy scales.

propose an estimator of multiple covariance matrices which allows for

existing estimators, which estimate the covariance matrices of interest
indirectly, our estimator is direct, ensures positive definiteness, and is the
solution to a convex optimization problem. We compute our estimator using a

directly and provide a rate for obtaining feasibility, assuming that the outer
function is strongly convex. In our work, we suggest a new approach that is
designed for bilevel problems with simple outer functions, such as the $l_1$
norm, which are not required to be either smooth or strongly convex. In our new
ITerative Approximation and Level-set EXpansion (ITALEX) approach, we alternate
between expanding the level-set of the outer function and approximately
optimizing the inner problem over this level-set. We show that optimizing the
inner function through first-order methods such as proximal gradient and
generalized conditional gradient results in a feasibility convergence rate of
$O(1/k)$, which up to now was a rate only achieved by bilevel algorithms for
smooth and strongly convex outer functions. Moreover, we prove an
$O(1/\sqrt{k})$ rate of convergence for the outer function, contrary to
existing methods, which only provide asymptotic guarantees. We demonstrate this
performance through numerical experiments.

release in criminal justice and loan approvals in consumer finance, by
counterfactually predicting an outcome under a proposed decision (e.g., would
the applicant default if we approved this loan?). There may, however, have been
unmeasured confounders that jointly affected decisions and outcomes in the
historical data. We propose a mean outcome sensitivity model that bounds the
extent to which unmeasured confounders could affect outcomes on average. The
mean outcome sensitivity model partially identifies the conditional likelihood
of the outcome under the proposed decision, popular predictive performance
metrics, and predictive disparities. We derive their identified sets and
develop procedures for the confounding-robust learning and evaluation of
statistical risk assessments. We propose a nonparametric regression procedure
for the bounds on the conditional likelihood of the outcome under the proposed
decision, and estimators for the bounds on predictive performance and

some fundamental aspects of mechanism design. We focus on single-item auctions
where the values of the bidders are drawn from some (possibly correlated)
distribution $\mathcal F$. Let $f$ be the allocation function of an optimal
mechanism for $\mathcal F$. Informally, $S$ is (linearly) rigid in $\mathcal F$
if for every mechanism $M'$ with an allocation function $f'$ where $f$ and $f'$
agree on the allocation of at most $x$-fraction of the instances of $S$, the
expected revenue of $M'$ is at most an $x$ fraction of the optimal revenue. We
use rigidity to explain the singular success of Cremer and McLean's auction.
Recall that the revenue of Cremer and McLean's auction is the optimal welfare
if the distribution obeys a certain ``full rank'' condition, but no analogous
constructions are known if this condition does not hold. Note that the
Kolmogorov complexity of the allocation function of Cremer and McLean's auction
is logarithmic, whereas we use rigidity to show that for some distributions
that do not obey the full rank condition, the Kolmogorov complexity of the
allocation function of every mechanism that provides a constant approximation
is almost linear. We further investigate rigidity assuming different notions of
individual rationality. Assuming ex-post individual rationality, if there is a
rigid set, the structure of the optimal mechanism is simple: the player with
the highest value ``usually'' wins the item and contributes most of the
revenue. In contrast, assuming interim individual rationality, there are
distributions with a rigid set $S$ where the optimal mechanism has no obvious
allocation pattern (i.e., its Kolmogorov complexity is high). Our results help
explain why we have little hope of developing good, simple and generic
approximation mechanisms in the interim individual rationality world.

additional members of the known $z\sim7.7$ Ly$\alpha$-emitter (LAE) cluster
(Tilvi et al. 2020). With the addition of these newly-discovered $z\sim7.7$
LAEs, this is currently the largest measured LAE cluster at $z>7$. The
unusually-high Ly$\alpha$ detection rate at $z\sim7.7$ in this field suggests
significantly stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission from the clustered LAEs than from

the MXT flight model at the Panter X-ray test facility under the nominal

data at series of characteristic energies probing the entire MXT energy range,
from 0.28 keV up to 9 keV, for multiple source positions with the center of the
point spread function (PSF) inside and outside the detector field of view
(FOV). We stacked the data of the positions with the PSF outside the FOV to
obtain a uniformly illuminated matrix and reduced all data sets using a
dedicated pipeline. We determined the best spectral performance of MXT using an
optimized data processing, especially for the energy calibration and the charge
sharing effect induced by the pixel low energy thresholding. Our results
demonstrate that MXT is compliant with the instrument requirement regarding the
energy resolution (<80 eV at 1.5 keV), the low and high energy threshold, and
the accuracy of the energy calibration ($\pm$20 eV). We also determined the
charge transfer inefficiency (~$10^{-5}$) of the detector and modeled its
evolution with energy prior to the irradiation that MXT will undergo during its
in-orbit lifetime. Finally, we measured the relation of the energy resolution
as function of the photon energy. We determined an equivalent noise charge of
4.9 $\pm$ 0.2 e- rms for the MXT detection chain and a Fano factor of 0.131
$\pm$ 0.003 in silicon at 208 K, in agreement with previous works. This

thermodynamic quantities. Unlike the case of gold, at the debromination step we
observe the appearance of organometallic molecules and chains, which can be
explained by their negative formation energy in the presence of a silver adatom
reservoir. At the dehydrogenation temperature the persistence of intercalated
Br atoms hinders the formation of well-structured graphene ribbons, which are
instead observed on gold, leading only to a partial lateral coupling of the PPP

vessel can execute special low-speed maneuvers like hover, crabbing, reverse,

a DP vessel should be fully/overly actuated with several thrusters. This
article introduces a novel and experimental VecTwin positioning system (VTPS)
without making the ship fully/overly actuated. Unlike the usual dynamic
positioning system (DPS), the VTPS is developed for low-speed operations in a
calm harbor area. It is designed upon an assumption that the forces due to the
interaction between the rudders, the propeller, and the hull are linear with
the rudder angles within a range around the hover rudder angle. The linear
relationship is obtained through linear regression of the results from several
CFD simulations. The VTPS implements a PID controller that regulates the
actuator forces to achieve the given low-speed positioning objective. It was
tested in combined automatic docking and position-keeping experiments where
disturbances from the environment exist. It shows promising potential for a

observations collected a priori (from either fixed or adaptively evolving
behavior policies) to learn the optimal individualized decision rule in a given
class. Existing policy learning methods rely on a uniform overlap assumption,
i.e., the propensities of exploring all actions for all individual
characteristics are lower bounded in the offline dataset. In other words, the
performance of these methods depends on the worst-case propensity in the
offline dataset. As one has no control over the data collection process, this
assumption can be unrealistic in many situations, especially when the behavior
policies are allowed to evolve over time with diminishing propensities.
  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that optimizes lower confidence
bounds (LCBs) -- instead of point estimates -- of the policy values. The LCBs
are constructed by quantifying the estimation uncertainty of the augmented
inverse propensity weighted (AIPW)-type estimators using knowledge of the
behavior policies for collecting the offline data. Without assuming any uniform
overlap condition, we establish a data-dependent upper bound for the
suboptimality of our algorithm, which depends only on (i) the overlap for the
optimal policy, and (ii) the complexity of the policy class. As an implication,
for adaptively collected data, we ensure efficient policy learning as long as
the propensities for optimal actions are lower bounded over time, while those
for suboptimal ones are allowed to diminish arbitrarily fast. In our
theoretical analysis, we develop a new self-normalized concentration inequality

Sometimes hydropower is accompanied by other services provided by multipurpose
reservoirs, such as water supply, irrigation, navigation, flood control and
recreation. Despite all these benefits, hydropower can be a polarizing issue. A
large sample of projects with poor planning and execution provides numerous
arguments for its opponents. Large and complex projects frequently suffer
overcost and delays. The direct impacts are related to the disruption of river
ecosystems and surrounding habitats due to the flooding of large areas, and the
fragmentation of rivers caused by the construction of dams and the reduction of
sediment transport that impoverishes aquatic life. People displacement and
compensation are always a complex issue. Hydropower projects can also cause
indirect impacts, such as additional deforestation related to the construction
of workers' villages, access roads and transmission lines. Finally, reservoirs
may also become a significant source of methane emission, especially in
tropical areas. This paper offers an analytical approach for sustainable

In PROCOVA-CMH, subjects are stratified on a single prognostic covariate
reflective of their predicted outcome on the control treatment (e.g. placebo).
This prognostic score is generated based on baseline covariates through a model
trained on historical data. We propose two closed-form prospective estimators
for the asymptotic sampling variance of the log RR that rely only on values
obtainable from observed historical outcomes and the prognostic model.
Importantly, these estimators can be used to inform sample size during trial

asymptotic coverage for valid inference. Like other covariate adjustment
methods, PROCOVA-CMH can reduce the variance of the treatment effect estimate
when compared to an unadjusted (unstratified) CMH analysis. In addition to
statistical methods, simulations and a case study in Alzheimer's Disease are

adopted to derive the global distributions of solar wind particles. Spherically

sophisticated hybrid model that includes charge-exchange and proton/neutral
excitation processes are used to study the low triplet line ratio
$G=\frac{i+f}{r}$ (0.77$\pm$0.58) of O VII and total x-ray luminosity around
Mars. We further calculate the emission factor $\alpha$-value with different
neutrals over a wide ion abundance and velocity ranges. Our results are in good
agreement with those of previous reports. The evolution of the charge stage of
solar wind ions shows that sequential recombination due to charge-exchange can
be negligible at the interaction region. This only appears below the altitude
of 400~km. The anonymous low disk $G$ ratio can be easily explained by the
collisional quenching effect at neutral densities higher than
10$^{11}$cm$^{-3}$. However, the quenching contribution is small in Mars'
exosphere and only appears below 400~km. Charge-exchange with H$_2$ and N$_2$
is still the most likely reason for this low $G$-ratio. X-ray emissivity maps
in collisions with different neutrals differ from each other. A clear bow shock
in the collision with all the neutrals is in accordance with previous reports.
The resulting total x-ray luminosity of 6.55~MW shows a better agreement with

extractive QA. We show that, with consistent tokenization, the model performs
better in both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, with a notable average of
+1.7 F2 gain when a BART model is trained on SQuAD and evaluated on 8 QA
datasets. Further, the model converges faster, and becomes less likely to
generate out-of-context answers. With these findings, we would like to call for
more attention on how tokenization should be done when solving extractive tasks

Rapoport-Zink space of signature $(1,n-1)$ by using the Bruhat-Tits
stratification on its special fiber. As such, we apply the same method that we
developped for the unramified case in two previous papers. More precisely, we
first investigate the cohomology of a given closed Bruhat-Tits stratum. It is
isomorphic to a generalized Deligne-Lusztig variety which is in general not
smooth, and is associated to a finite group of symplectic similitudes. We
determine the weights of the Frobenius and most of the unipotent
representations occuring in its cohomology. This computation involves the
spectral sequence associated to a stratification by classical Deligne-Lusztig
varieties, which are parabolically induced from Coxeter varieties of smaller
symplectic groups. In particular, all the unipotent representations contribute
to only two cuspidal series. Then, we introduce the analytical tubes of the
closed Bruhat-Tits strata, which give an open cover of the generic fiber of the
Rapoport-Zink space. Using the associated \v{C}ech spectral sequence, we prove
that certain cohomology groups of the Rapoport-Zink space at hyperspecial level
fail to be admissible if $n$ is large enough. Eventually, when $n=2$ in the
split case, when $n=3$ and when $n=4$ in the non-split case, we give a complete
description of the cohomology of the supersingular locus of the associated
Shimura variety at hyperspecial level, in terms of automorphic representations.
In particular, certain automorphic representations occur with a multiplicity
depending on $p$. Thus, our computations in the ramified case recover all the
main features of the unramified case, despite new technical difficulties due to
the closed Bruhat-Tits strata not being smooth.

condensates are varied including activating, inhibiting, and localizing
reactions. Recent theoretical work has shown that the phase separation of
proteins into droplets can diminish cell to cell variability in protein
abundance. However, the extent to which phase separation involving mRNAs may
also buffer noise has yet to be explored. In this paper, we introduce a
phenomenological model for the phase separation of mRNAs into RNP condensates,
and quantify noise suppression as a function of gene expression kinetic
parameters. Through stochastic simulations, we highlight the ability for
condensates formed from just a handful of mRNAs to regulate the abundance and
suppress the fluctuations of proteins. We place particular emphasis on how this
mechanism can facilitate efficient transcription by reducing noise even in the
situation of infrequent bursts of transcription by exploiting the physics of a
concentration-dependent, deterministic phase separation threshold. We
investigate two biologically relevant models in which phase separation acts to
either ""buffer"" noise by storing mRNA in inert droplets, or ""filter"" phase
separated mRNAs by accelerating their decay, and quantify expression noise as a
function of kinetic parameters. In either case the most efficient expression
occurs when bursts produce mRNAs close the phase separation threshold, which we
find to be broadly consistent with observations of an RNP-droplet forming
cyclinin multinucleate Ashbya gossypii cells. We finally consider the
contribution of noise in the phase separation threshold, and show that protein
copy number noise can be suppressed by phase separation threshold fluctuations

the process of calculation by exploiting the physical nature of light have been
conducted. Previous studies utilized quantum interference of photons to achieve
collective decision-making without choice conflicts when solving the
competitive multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental example of reinforcement
learning. However, the bandit problem deals with a static environment where the
agent's action does not influence the reward probabilities. This study aims to
extend the conventional approach to a more general multi-agent reinforcement
learning targeting the grid world problem. Unlike the conventional approach,
the proposed scheme deals with a dynamic environment where the reward changes
because of agents' actions. A successful photonic reinforcement learning scheme
requires both a photonic system that contributes to the quality of learning and
a suitable algorithm. This study proposes a novel learning algorithm,
discontinuous bandit Q-learning, in view of a potential photonic
implementation. Here, state-action pairs in the environment are regarded as
slot machines in the context of the bandit problem and an updated amount of
Q-value is regarded as the reward of the bandit problem. We perform numerical
simulations to validate the effectiveness of the bandit algorithm. In addition,
we propose a multi-agent architecture in which agents are indirectly connected
through quantum interference of light and quantum principles ensure the
conflict-free property of state-action pair selections among agents. We
demonstrate that multi-agent reinforcement learning can be accelerated owing to
conflict avoidance among multiple agents.

at least two decades, it is still one of the least explored but most exciting
areas to study light-matter interaction. Due to the small photon energy of THz
radiation, it can propagate through non-conductive materials and resonantly
interact with low-energy excitations, leading to a plethora of applications.
The THz pulse is thereby primarily used as a probe while an optical pulse
excites the material that is examined. In contrast, intense strong-field THz
transients would allow on-demand control of the properties of matter. Current
table-top THz sources remain rather weak, with the most promising being optical
rectification (OR) in nonlinear crystals and two-color plasma filaments pumped
by near-IR sources. While the former is mainly restricted by multi-photon
absorption of the short wavelength driving pulse, causing crystal damage, the
latter suffers from pump pulse scattering in dense plasma and limited laser
field-asymmetry. These limitations can be surpassed with intense long
wavelength driving pulses. Until recently, such high-power mid-IR sources were
simply not available. In this work, we exploit the recently developed mid-IR
optical parametric chirped pulse amplifier system to drive efficient THz
generation in the organic crystal DAST by OR and in two-color plasma filaments,
wherein we boost the optical- to THz conversion efficiency by almost an order
of magnitude, compared to previous works with near-IR drivers. The intense THz
source is further applied to heterostructure quantum dots without any field
enhancing structures to investigate the pure quantum confined Stark effect. The
possibility to manipulate optical properties of nano-scale semiconductors by
direct THz radiation demonstrates the feasibility for an all-optical
electro-absorption modulator with data rates in the range of Tbit/s.

closeness of the reduced-order model to the original model is generally gauged
by using system norms of additive or relative error system. The relative error
is a superior criterion to the additive error in assessing accuracy in many

we propose an oblique projection algorithm that minimizes the H2 norm of the

approximated by a reduced-order model that exhibits high fidelity within the

can be tolerated due to the nature of the problem. The approximation error
quantifies the quality of the reduced-order model, which is generally measured
in absolute or relative terms. A small absolute error can be a misleading
notion of accuracy when the original and reduced systems' responses are
inherently small within the desired frequency interval. The relative error
quantifies percentage error, which is more meaningful in such scenarios. In
this paper, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the
frequency-limited H$_2$ norm of the relative error system are derived. Then, an
oblique projection algorithm is proposed based on these optimality conditions,
which ensures a small relative error within the desired frequency interval.
Unlike the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not require
solutions for large-scale linear matrix equations. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is compared with frequency-limited balanced truncation,
frequency-limited balanced stochastic truncation, and frequency-limited

methods can effectively reproduce the observed rotation curve, by using a
variable fractional dimension $D\left (R\right )$ as was done for other
galaxies in previous studies. For AGC 114905, we obtain a variable dimension in
the range $D \approx 2.2 -3.2$, but our fixed $D =3$ curve can still fit all
the experimental data within their error bars. This confirms other studies
indicating that the dynamics of this galaxy can be described almost entirely by
the baryonic mass distribution alone. However, our NFDG model explains the
residual discrepancies without using any dark matter component.
  In the case of NGC 1052-DF2, we use an argument based on the NFDG extension
of the virial theorem applied to the velocity dispersion of globular clusters
showing that, in general, discrepancies between observed and predicted velocity
dispersions can be attributed to an overall fractal dimension $D <3$ of the
astrophysical structure considered and not to the presence of dark matter. For
NGC 1052-DF2 we estimate $D \approx 2.9$, thus confirming that this galaxy
almost follows standard Newtonian behavior. We also consider the case of the
Bullet Cluster merger (1E0657-56), assumed to be one of the strongest proofs of
dark matter existence. A simplified but effective NFDG model of the collision

rate, and LET. Here we validate these three quantities under FLASH conditions,
which includes the quantum uncertainty in the time-dependent instantaneous dose
rate (IDR) curves and LET spectra that underlie the newly proposed integrated
optimization framework.
  Measurements of dose, IDR, and LET were performed at the Emory Proton Therapy
Center using a FLASH proton beam with a nominal energy of 250 MeV and a 3D
printed ridge filter. Because 3D printing resin is made from a proprietary
chemical formula, we developed a method for realistically characterizing and
modeling the material in simulations. Absolute dose in 3D space was measured
using a 2D MatriXX PT detector as well as by a novel 4D multi-layer strip
ionization chamber (MLSIC), which also simultaneously measures IDR. Further
timing data was measured in the secondary beam by detecting prompt gammas using
a Minipix Timepix3; a second detector, Advapix Timepix3, was used to measure
LET. To account for the quantum mechanical nature of particle transport, we
developed a technique for detecting individual protons within a high flux
primary beam, which was necessary for properly measuring LET spectra.
  TOPAS simulations agreed with measurement, with absolute dose typically
having a gamma passing rate of at least 95% (3 mm/3% criteria). Likewise, IDR
and LET showed good agreement, with averaged IDR values agreeing within 0.3%
with fluctuations on the order of 10%, and LET distributions overlapping by at
least 85% and showing an increase in high LET components (greater than 4
keV/um) with increasing depth.
  As LET and FLASH optimization continues to grow in popularity, measuring IDR,
LET, and dose will become even more important, and we expect that the methods
described here will prove to be useful tools in radiotherapy treatment planning

years due to the rapid development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and
panoramic cameras. One major problem in streaming panoramic videos is that
panoramic videos are much larger in size compared to traditional ones.
Moreover, the user devices are often in a wireless environment, with limited
battery, computation power, and bandwidth. To reduce resource consumption,
researchers have proposed ways to predict the users' viewports so that only
part of the entire video needs to be transmitted from the server. However, the
robustness of such prediction approaches has been overlooked in the literature:
it is usually assumed that only a few models, pre-trained on past users'
experiences, are applied for prediction to all users. We observe that those
pre-trained models can perform poorly for some users because they might have
drastically different behaviors from the majority, and the pre-trained models
cannot capture the features in unseen videos. In this work, we propose a novel
meta learning based viewport prediction paradigm to alleviate the worst
prediction performance and ensure the robustness of viewport prediction. This
paradigm uses two machine learning models, where the first model predicts the
viewing direction, and the second model predicts the minimum video prefetch
size that can include the actual viewport. We first train two meta models so
that they are sensitive to new training data, and then quickly adapt them to
users while they are watching the videos. Evaluation results reveal that the
meta models can adapt quickly to each user, and can significantly increase the
prediction accuracy, especially for the worst-performing predictions.

introduce a new paradigm for task-oriented dialogue - Dialog2API - to greatly
expand the functionality and provide seamless dialogue experience. The
conversational model interacts with the environment by generating and executing
programs triggering a set of pre-defined APIs. The model also manages the
dialogue policy and interact with the user through generating appropriate
natural language responses. By allowing generating free-form programs,
Dialog2API supports composite goals by combining different APIs, whereas
unrestricted program revision provides natural and robust dialogue experience.
To facilitate Dialog2API, the core model is provided with API documents, an
execution environment and optionally some example dialogues annotated with
programs. We propose an approach tailored for the Dialog2API, where the
dialogue states are represented by a stack of programs, with most recently
mentioned program on the top of the stack. Dialog2API can work with many
application scenarios such as software automation and customer service. In this

Sight additionally enables a decoder to attend to an encoded future plot event.
This motivates the decoder to expand on the context in a way that logically

be written by a human author to steer the narrative being generated in a

often causes a high risk of ambiguity when recovering the masked region of 3D
scenes. To this end, we propose a novel informative-preserved reconstruction,
which explores local statistics to discover and preserve the representative
structured points, effectively enhancing the pretext masking task for 3D scene
understanding. Integrated with a progressive reconstruction manner, our method
can concentrate on modeling regional geometry and enjoy less ambiguity for
masked reconstruction. Besides, such scenes with progressive masking ratios can
also serve to self-distill their intrinsic spatial consistency, requiring to
learn the consistent representations from unmasked areas. By elegantly
combining informative-preserved reconstruction on masked areas and consistency
self-distillation from unmasked areas, a unified framework called MM-3DScene is
yielded. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a host of downstream tasks.
The consistent improvement (e.g., +6.1 mAP@0.5 on object detection and +2.2%

physical quark masses, the kaon mass lies above the two- and three-pion

decoders that run in time quadratic and cubic in the number of ""bees"" for the

by studying the matching algorithms in the context of channel coding, we
further reduce the running times by using classical tools like peeling decoders

ways: 1) the summaries in BUMP are harder to discriminate and less probable
under SOTA summarization models, 2) unlike non-pair-based datasets, BUMP can be
used to measure the consistency of metrics, and reveals that the most
discriminative metrics tend not to be the most consistent, and 3) unlike

well-known Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate
information. Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed
latent score $\{\theta_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are
given by $\{\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\top\beta^*\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\alpha_i^*$ and
${x}_i^\top\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th

statistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE
of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity. This
allows us to answer the question whether some covariates have any explanation
power for latent scores and to threshold some sparse parameters to improve the
ranking performance. We improve the approximation method used in (Gao et al.,

validate our theoretical results through large-scale numerical studies and an

scientific researches. Conventional multiple testing procedures usually suffer
considerable loss of testing efficiency due to the lack of consideration of
correlations among tests. In fact, the appropriate use of correlation
information not only enhances the efficacy of multiple testing but also
improves the interpretability of the results. Since the disease- or
trait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often tend to be clustered
and exhibit serial correlations, the hidden Markov model (HMM) based multiple
testing procedure has been successfully applied in genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). It is important to note that modeling the entire chromosome
using one HMM is somewhat rough. To overcome this issue, this paper employs the
hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) to describe local correlations among
tests and develops a multiple testing procedure that can not only automatically
divide different class of chromosome regions, but also takes into account local
correlations among tests. Theoretically, it is shown that the proposed multiple
testing procedure is valid and optimal in some sense. Then a data-driven
procedure is developed to mimic the oracle version. Extensive simulations and
the real data analysis show that the novel multiple testing procedure
outperforms its competitors.

options to deal with errors in four-dimensional variational data assimilation
(4DVar), with the aim of balancing the degrees of freedom and model
constraints. Strong model constraints were imposed to reduce the degrees of
freedom encountered when optimizing the strongly constrained 4DVar problem, and
it was assumed that the models were perfect. The weakly constrained approach
sought to distinguish initial errors from model errors, and to correct them
separately using weak model constraints. Our proposed i4DVar* method exploits
the hidden mechanism that corrects initial and model errors simultaneously in
the strongly constrained 4DVar. The i4DVar* method divides the assimilation
window into several sub-windows, each of which has a unique integral and
flow-dependent correction term to simultaneously handle the initial and model
errors over a relatively short period. To overcome the high degrees of freedom
of the weakly constrained 4DVar, for the first time we use ensemble simulations
not only to solve the 4DVar optimization problem, but also to formulate this
method. Thus, the i4DVar* problem is solvable even if there are many degrees of
freedom. We experimentally show that i4DVar* provides superior performance with
much lower computational costs than existing methods, and is simple to
implement.

for which the traditional techniques might fall short. In this paper, we
conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the impacts of
textual dissimilarity on the detection of duplicate bug reports. First, we
collect a total of 92,854 bug reports from three open-source systems and
construct two datasets containing textually similar and textually dissimilar

textually dissimilar duplicate bug reports often miss important components

textual differences and poor performance by the existing techniques. Finally,
we apply domain-specific embedding to duplicate bug report detection problems,
which shows mixed results. All these findings above warrant further

various configurations including within the backbone (main-chain LC polymers)
or at the ends of side-chains attached to the backbone in an end-on or side-on
configuration (side-chain LC polymers or SCLCPs), which can display synergistic
properties arising from both their LC and polymeric character. At lower
temperatures, chain conformations may be significantly altered due to the
mesoscale LC ordering, thus, when heating from the LC ordered state through the
LC to isotropic phase transition, the chains return from a more stretched to a
more random coil conformation. This can cause macroscopic shape changes, which
depend significantly on the type of LC attachment and other architectural
properties of the polymer. Here, to study the structure-property relationships
for SCLCPs with a range of different architectures, we develop a coarse-grained
model that includes torsional potentials along with LC interactions of a
Gay--Berne form. We create systems of different side chain lengths, chain
stiffnesses, and LC attachment types, and track their structural properties as
a function of temperature. Our modeled systems indeed form a variety of
well-organized mesophase structures at low temperatures, and we predict higher
LC to isotropic transition temperatures for the end-on side-chain systems than
for analogous side-on side-chain systems. Understanding these phase transitions

fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts

modeled and tested: (I) human-driven vehicles (HVs), (II) connected vehicles
(CVs), (III) automated vehicles (AVs), and (IV) connected automated vehicles
(CAVs). Various scenarios are defined based on different market penetration
rates of these four vehicle types. AVs are assumed to move more cautiously
compared to human drivers. CVs and CAVs are supposed to receive information
about the future state of traffic lights and adjust their speeds to avoid
stopping at the intersection. As a result, their movements are expected to be
smoother with a lower number of stops. The effects of these vehicle types in
mixed traffic are investigated in terms of saturation headway, capacity, travel
time, delay, and queue length in different lane groups of an intersection. A
Python script code developed by Vissim is used to provide the communication
between the signal controller and CVs and CAVs to adjust their speeds
accordingly. The results show that increasing CV and CAV market penetration
rate reduces saturation headway and consequently increases capacity at
signalized intersections. On the other hand, increasing the AV market
penetration rate deteriorates traffic operations. Results also indicate that
the highest increase (80%) and decrease (20%) in lane group capacity are
observed, respectively, in a traffic stream of 100% CAVs and 100% AVs.

Micro phasor measurement units ($\mu$PMUs) facilitate co-synchronized
measurements with high granularity, albeit at an often prohibitively expensive
installation cost. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
measurements can supplement $\mu$PMU data, although they are received at a

associated with load dynamics and unsynchronized measurements-not only are the
SCADA and $\mu$PMU measurements not synchronized with each other, but the SCADA
measurements themselves are received at different time intervals with respect
to one another. This paper proposes a non-linear state estimation framework
which models dynamic load uncertainty error by updating the variances of the
unsynchronized measurements, leading to a time-varying system of weights in the
weighted least squares state estimator. Case studies are performed on the
33-Bus Distribution System in MATPOWER, using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic

optimization problems. We can estimate a computational time of QA by using the
so-called adiabatic condition derived from the adiabatic theorem. The adiabatic
condition consists of two parts: an energy gap and a transition matrix. It is
believed that the computational time mainly depends on the energy gap during QA
and is inversely proportional to a polynomial of the minimal energy gap. In
this paper, we challenge this common wisdom. We propose a general method to
construct counterintuitive models with a constant energy gap during QA where QA
with a constant annealing time fails despite a constant energy gap. In our
formalism, we choose a known model exhibiting an exponentially small energy gap
during QA, and we modify the model by adding a specific penalty term to the
Hamiltonian. In the modified model, the transition matrix in the adiabatic
condition becomes exponentially large with the number of qubits, while the
energy gap remains constant. As concrete examples we consider the adiabatic
Grover search and the ferromagnetic p-spin model. In these cases, by adding the
penalty term, the success probability of QA in the modified models become
exponentially small despite a constant energy gap. Our results paves a way for
better understanding of the QA performance.

been developed in recent years to overcome the adversarial attacks. In this
paper, we propose a multi-head uncertainty inference (MH-UI) framework for
detecting adversarial attack examples. We adopt a multi-head architecture with
multiple prediction heads (i.e., classifiers) to obtain predictions from
different depths in the DNNs and introduce shallow information for the UI.
Using independent heads at different depths, the normalized predictions are
assumed to follow the same Dirichlet distribution, and we estimate distribution
parameter of it by moment matching. Cognitive uncertainty brought by the
adversarial attacks will be reflected and amplified on the distribution.
Experimental results show that the proposed MH-UI framework can outperform all
the referred UI methods in the adversarial attack detection task with different
settings.

E-field sensor composed of etchless lithium niobate (LN) material and hybrid
coupling-grating systems in the visible near-infrared regime. Such
configuration supports high-quality factor quasi-BIC resonance, which generates
strong localized field confinement. Due to the large electro-optic coefficient
of LN material, one can shift the wavelength and reflection ratio of resonance
by tuning the refractive index of LN material. An analytical theory is carried
out to explain the relationship between the refractive index variations and the
applied voltages, so we successfully obtained a tuning sensitivity of 40.8 nm/V
and a minimum detectable electric field amplitude of 24.5 mV with wavelength
resolution of 1 nm. Due to the low parasitic capacitance of LN material and
high conductivity of gold film and ITO layer which are utilized as the
electrodes, the 3dB bandwidth of the devices should exceed 154 GHz. And we

InterMulti, to capture complex multimodal interactions from different views and
identify emotions from multimodal signals. Our proposed framework decomposes
signals of different modalities into three kinds of multimodal interaction
representations, including a modality-full interaction representation, a
modality-shared interaction representation, and three modality-specific
interaction representations. Additionally, to balance the contribution of
different modalities and learn a more informative latent interaction
representation, we developed a novel Text-dominated Hierarchical High-order
Fusion(THHF) module. THHF module reasonably integrates the above three kinds of
representations into a comprehensive multimodal interaction representation.
Extensive experimental results on widely used datasets, (i.e.) MOSEI, MOSI and

the aperiodic variables are excluded and the periodic variables are divided

ranging from hyperparameter optimization to meta-learning. Existing studies on
bilevel optimization, however, focus on either centralized or synchronous
distributed setting. The centralized bilevel optimization approaches require
collecting massive amount of data to a single server, which inevitably incur
significant communication expenses and may give rise to data privacy risks.
Synchronous distributed bilevel optimization algorithms, on the other hand,
often face the straggler problem and will immediately stop working if a few
workers fail to respond. As a remedy, we propose Asynchronous Distributed
Bilevel Optimization (ADBO) algorithm. The proposed ADBO can tackle bilevel
optimization problems with both nonconvex upper-level and lower-level objective
functions, and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, it is
revealed through theoretic analysis that the iteration complexity of ADBO to
obtain the $\epsilon$-stationary point is upper bounded by
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{{{\epsilon ^2}}})$. Thorough empirical studies on public
datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed ADBO.

  Detection","9 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compared to typical multi-sensor systems, monocular 3D object detection has
attracted much attention due to its simple configuration. However, there is
still a significant gap between LiDAR-based and monocular-based methods. In
this paper, we find that the ill-posed nature of monocular imagery can lead to
depth ambiguity. Specifically, objects with different depths can appear with
the same bounding boxes and similar visual features in the 2D image.
Unfortunately, the network cannot accurately distinguish different depths from
such non-discriminative visual features, resulting in unstable depth training.
To facilitate depth learning, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
module, One Bounding Box Multiple Objects (OBMO). Concretely, we add a set of
suitable pseudo labels by shifting the 3D bounding box along the viewing
frustum. To constrain the pseudo-3D labels to be reasonable, we carefully
design two label scoring strategies to represent their quality. In contrast to
the original hard depth labels, such soft pseudo labels with quality scores
allow the network to learn a reasonable depth range, boosting training
stability and thus improving final performance. Extensive experiments on KITTI
and Waymo benchmarks show that our method significantly improves
state-of-the-art monocular 3D detectors by a significant margin (The
improvements under the moderate setting on KITTI validation set are
$\mathbf{1.82\sim 10.91\%}$ mAP in BEV and $\mathbf{1.18\sim 9.36\%}$ mAP in

with a strong preference for keeping consumption above an exogenous social
norm, but who is willing to tolerate occasional dips below it. We do this by
splicing two CRRA preference orderings, one with high curvature below the norm
and the other with low curvature at or above it. We find this formulation
appealing for many endowment funds and sovereign wealth funds, including the
Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which inspired our research. We solve
this model analytically as well as numerically and find that annual spending
should not only be significantly lower than the expected financial return, but
mostly also procyclical. In particular, financial losses should, as a rule, be
followed by larger than proportional spending cuts, except when some smoothing
is needed to keep spending from falling too far below the social norm. Yet, at
very low wealth levels, spending should be kept particularly low in order to
build sufficient wealth to raise consumption above the social norm. Financial
risk taking should also be modest and procyclical, so that the investor
sometimes may want to ""buy at the top"" and ""sell at the bottom"". Many of these
features are shared by habitformation models and other models with some lower
bound for consumption. However, our specification is more flexible and thus
more easily adaptable to actual fund management. The nonlinearity of the policy
functions may present challenges regarding delegation to professional managers.
However, simpler rules of thumb with constant or slowly moving equity share and
consumption-wealth ratio can reach almost the same expected discounted utility.
However, the constant levels will then look very different from the
implications of expected CRRA utility or Epstein-Zin preferences in that
consumption is much lower.

implemented as a signal that disperses throughout the tissue. On the other
hand, machine learning models have been developed for pattern recognition and

Application to in vitro data predicted a low signal dispersion value. To test

mainly meaning that they target at removing the non-influential covariates from
the model and at delivering a sparse model. When categorical covariates are
present, with their levels being dummy coded, the number of parameters included
in the model grows rapidly, fact that emphasizes the need for reducing the
number of parameters to be estimated. In this case, beyond variable selection,
sparsity is also achieved through fusion of levels of covariates which do not
differentiate significantly in terms of their influence on the response
variable. In this work a new regularization technique is introduced, called
$L_{0}$-Fused Group Lasso ($L_{0}$-FGL) for binary logistic regression. It uses
a group lasso penalty for factor selection and for the fusion part it applies
an $L_{0}$ penalty on the differences among the levels' parameters of a
categorical predictor. Using adaptive weights, the adaptive version of
$L_{0}$-FGL method is derived. Theoretical properties, such as the existence,
$\sqrt{n}$ consistency and oracle properties under certain conditions, are
established. In addition, it is shown that even in the diverging case where the
number of parameters $p_{n}$ grows with the sample size $n$, $\sqrt{n}$
consistency and a consistency in variable selection result are achieved. Two
computational methods, PIRLS and a block coordinate descent (BCD) approach
using quasi Newton, are developed and implemented. A simulation study supports
that $L_{0}$-FGL shows an outstanding performance, especially in the high
dimensional case.

Deriving gaits with a neuromuscular reflex model through multi-stage

IP-typical intersection of ground reaction forces. The non-IP gaits found are
stable and successfully rejected step-down perturbations, which indicates that
an IP is not necessary for locomotion robustness or postural stability. A
collision-based analysis shows that non-IP gaits feature center of mass (CoM)
dynamics with vectors of the CoM velocity and ground reaction force
increasingly opposing each other, indicating an increased mechanical cost of
transport. Although our computer simulation results have yet to be confirmed

postural stability should be further investigated. Moreover, our observations
on the CoM dynamics and gait efficiency suggest that the IP may have an
alternative or additional function that should be considered.

novel scoring approaches for both the CATE case and an important subset of

customer acces to a product feature, and the treatment is the customer's choice
to use that feature. Being able to score model performance out of sample allows
us to apply hyperparameter optimization methods to causal model selection and

EconML libraries for implementation of causal inference models (and also
includes a Transformed Outcome model implementation), and on FLAML for
hyperparameter optimization and for component models used in the causal models.
We demonstrate on synthetic data that optimizing the proposed scores is a
reliable method for choosing the model and its hyperparameter values, whose

We found coherent pulsations at $\sim 401$ Hz and an orbital solution
consistent with previous studies. The 3-20 keV pulse profile can be well fitted
with three harmonically related sinusoidal components with background-corrected
fractional amplitude of $\sim 3.5 \%$, $\sim 1.2 \%$ and $\sim 0.37 \%$ for
fundamental, second and third harmonic, respectively. Our energy-resolved pulse
profile evolution study indicate a strong energy dependence. We also observed a
soft lag in fundamental and hard lag during its harmonic. The broadband
spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 can be well described with a combination of
thermal emission component with $kT \sim 1$ keV, a thermal Comptonization
($\Gamma \sim 1.67$) from the hot corona and broad emission lines due to Fe.

mass. In the present article, we study the associated Goldstone mode, the pion,
and we compute the pion decay constant in the chiral limit. Our approach
exploits the fact that the coupling (defined in the Taylor scheme) in the pure
gauge sector is perturbative, as observed in lattice simulations which,
together with a $1/N_c$-expansion, allows for a systematic, controllable
approximation scheme in the low energy regime of QCD. At leading order, this
leads to the well-known rainbow-ladder resummation. We study the region of
parameter space of the model that gives physical values of the pion decay
constant. This allows one to constrain the gluon mass parameter as a function
of the coupling using a physically measured quantity.

to establish the kinematics of the basic unit of traffic flow, namely two

the vehicle spacing, the second is to derive the spacing margin and the
critical distance difference as well as the relationship they must satisfy, the
third is to complete the mathematical definition and give the necessary and
sufficient condition for the time headway to remain constant, and the fourth is
to derive the governing equation of the spacing margin and determine the two
key constraint spaces of the motion of consecutive vehicles. On this basis, the
composition of the traffic flow phenomenon and that of the traffic flow
property are determined, and the inherent regularity of traffic flow is briefly
elucidated. Thus, a basic theoretical framework specific to the study of
traffic flow is obtained. Based on the framework, three important issues,

additionally affected by high intrathyroidal iodide concentrations and take the
medication orally and, (iii) patients suffering from a life-threatening

these data aims to answer questions or determine the truthiness of hypothesis
sentences by understanding the semantic meaning of a table. While previous
works have devoted significant efforts to the tabular reasoning task, they
always assume there are sufficient labeled data. However, constructing
reasoning samples over tables (and related text) is labor-intensive, especially
when the reasoning process is complex. When labeled data is insufficient, the
performance of models will suffer an unendurable decline. In this paper, we
propose a unified framework for unsupervised complex tabular reasoning (UCTR),
which generates sufficient and diverse synthetic data with complex logic for
tabular reasoning tasks, assuming no human-annotated data at all. We first
utilize a random sampling strategy to collect diverse programs of different
types and execute them on tables based on a ""Program-Executor"" module. To
bridge the gap between the programs and natural language sentences, we design a
powerful ""NL-Generator"" module to generate natural language sentences with
complex logic from these programs. Since a table often occurs with its
surrounding texts, we further propose novel ""Table-to-Text"" and ""Text-to-Table""
operators to handle joint table-text reasoning scenarios. This way, we can
adequately exploit the unlabeled table resources to obtain a well-performed
reasoning model under an unsupervised setting. Our experiments cover different
tasks (question answering and fact verification) and different domains (general
and specific), showing that our unsupervised methods can achieve at most 93%
performance compared to supervised models. We also find that it can
substantially boost the supervised performance in low-resourced domains as a
data augmentation technique. Our code is available at

Transport (CommOT) for computing the rate distortion (RD) function. This work
is motivated by observing the fact that the transition law and the relative
entropy in communication theory can be viewed as the transport plan and the
regularized objective function in the optimal transport (OT) model. However,
unlike in classical OT problems, the RD function only possesses one-side
marginal distribution. Hence, to maintain the OT structure, we introduce
slackness variables to fulfill the other-side marginal distribution and then
propose a general framework (CommOT) for the RD function. The CommOT model is
solved via the alternating optimization technique and the well-known Sinkhorn
algorithm. In particular, the expected distortion threshold can be converted
into finding the unique root of a one-dimensional monotonic function with only
a few steps. Numerical experiments show that our proposed framework (CommOT)
for solving the RD function with given distortion threshold is efficient and
accurate.

communication, and computing, while simultaneously testing many core theories

quantum dots, color center hosting semiconductors, and other types of strongly
correlated materials can exhibit exotic properties such as edge conductivity,
multiferroicity, magnetoresistance, single photon emission, and optical-spin
locking. These emergent properties arise and depend strongly on the materials
detailed atomic scale structure, including atomic defects, dopants, and lattice
stacking. In this review, after introduction of different classes of quantum
materials and quantum excitations, we describe how progress in the field of
electron microscopy, including in situ and in operando EM, can accelerate
advances in quantum materials. Our review describes EM methods including: i)
principles and operation modes of EM, ii) EM spectroscopies, such as electron
energy loss spectroscopy, cathodoluminescence, and electron energy gain
spectroscopy, iii) 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, iv) dynamic
and ultrafast EM, v) complimentary ultrafast spectroscopies, and vi) atomic
electron tomography. We discuss how these methods inform structure function
relations in quantum materials down to the picometer scale and femtosecond time
resolution, and how they enable high resolution manipulation of quantum
materials. Among numerous results, our review highlights how EM has enabled
identification of the 3D structure of quantum defects, measuring reversible and
metastable dynamics of quantum excitations, mapping exciton states and single
photon emission, measuring nanoscale thermal transport and coupled excitation
dynamics, and measuring the internal electric field of quantum
heterointerfaces, all at the quantum materials intrinsic atomic and near

experimentally and simulationally show that this transition occurs through a

failure, using large scale atomistic simulations corroborated by experimental
fractography, reveals how the collective evolution and mutual interaction of
shear-driven plasticity and dilation-driven void formation (cavitation) control
the various macroscopic failure modes. In particular, we find that at global
failure, the size of the largest cavity in the loading direction exhibits a
nonmonotonic dependence on the temperature at a fixed strain rate, which is
rationalized in terms of the interplay between shear- and dilation-driven
plasticity. We also find that the size of the largest cavity scales with the
cross-sectional area of the undeformed sample. These results shed light on

based on images of rotated pallet blocks that were recorded as part of a
previously recorded and published dataset. In this process, the unique chipwood
pattern of the pallet block surface structure was retained, only changing the

re-identification testing and training purposes was generated, in a manner that
is distinct from ordinary data augmentation. In total, 1,004 new images of
pallet blocks were generated. The quality of the generated images was gauged
using a perspective classifier that was trained on the original images and then
applied to the synthetic ones, comparing the accuracy between the two sets of
images. The classification accuracy was 98% for the original images and 92% for
the synthetic images. In addition, the generated images were also used in a

evolution, their selection, and use them as a cosmological probe. The offsets
between different definitions of the center have been used to estimate the
cluster disturbance. Our goal is to study the distribution of the offset
between the X-ray and optical centers in clusters of galaxies. We study the
offset for eROSITA clusters. We aim to connect observations to hydrodynamical
simulations and N-body models. We assess the astrophysical effects affecting
the displacements. We measure the offset for clusters observed in eFEDS and
eRASS1. We focus on a subsample of 87 massive eFEDS clusters at low redshift.
We link the observations to the offset parameter Xoff measured on dark matter
halos in N-body simulations, using the hydrodynamical simulations as a bridge.
eFEDS clusters show a smaller offset compared to eRASS1, because the latter
contains a larger fraction of massive and disturbed structures. We measure an
average offset of 76.3+30.1-27.1 kpc on the subsample of 87 eFEDS clusters.
This is in agreement with the predictions from TNG and Magneticum, and the
distribution of Xoff from DMO simulations. The tails of the distributions are
different. Using the offset to classify relaxed and disturbed clusters, we
measure a relaxed fraction of 31% in the eFEDS subsample. Finally, we find a
correlation between the offset in hydrodynamical simulations and Xoff measured
on their parent DMO run and calibrate a relation between them. There is good
agreement between eROSITA data and simulations. Baryons cause a decrement
(increment) in the low (high) offset regime compared to the Xoff distribution.
The offset-Xoff relation provides an accurate prediction of the true Xoff
distribution in Magneticum and TNG. It allows introducing the offsets in
cosmology, marginalizing on dynamical selection effects.

polarization, faces a fundamental problem, the so-called micro-macro problem.
To overcome this problem, we combine empirical experimental research on biased
argument processing with a computational theory of group deliberation in order
to clarify the role of biased processing in debates around energy. The
experiment reveals a strong tendency to consider arguments aligned with the
current attitude more persuasive and to downgrade those speaking against it.
This is integrated into the framework of argument communication theory in which
agents exchange arguments about a certain topic and adapt opinions accordingly.
We derive a mathematical model that allows to relate the strength of biased
processing to expected attitude changes given the specific experimental
conditions and find a clear signature of moderate biased processing. We further
show that this model fits significantly better to the experimentally observed
attitude changes than the neutral argument processing assumption made in
previous models. Our approach provides new insight into the relationship
between biased processing and opinion polarization. At the individual level our
analysis reveals a sharp qualitative transition from attitude moderation to
polarization. At the collective level we find (i.) that weak biased processing
significantly accelerates group decision processes whereas (ii.) strong biased
processing leads to a persistent conflictual state of subgroup polarization.
While this shows that biased processing alone is sufficient for the emergence
of polarization, we also demonstrate that homophily may lead to intra-group
conflict at significantly lower rates of biased processing.

visualization explaining cerebral small vessel disease. Learning about its
avoidable risk factors serves to motivate the audience watching the resulting
visual data story. Using this example, we discuss the adaption of basic
narrative components. This includes the conflict and characters of a story, as
well as the story's structure and content to address and communicate specific
characteristics of medical data. Furthermore, we explore the extent to which
complex medical relationships need to be simplified to be understandable to a
general audience without distorting the underlying data and evidence. In
particular, the data needs to be preprocessed for non-experts and appropriate
forms of interaction must be found. We explore approaches to make the data more
personally relatable, such as including a fictional patient. We evaluated our
approach in a user study with 40 participants in a web-based implementation of
the designed story. We found that the combination of a carefully thought-out
storyline with a clear key message, appealing visualizations combined with
easy-to-use interactions, and credible references are crucial for creating a

non-perturbative formulation of superstring theory. However, it was found
recently that a Euclidean space-time appears in the conventional large-$N$
limit. In this work, we add a Lorentz invariant mass term to the original model
and consider a limit, in which the coefficient of the mass term vanishes at
large $N$. By performing complex Langevin simulations to overcome the sign
problem, we observe the emergence of expanding space-time with the Lorentzian
signature.

into coordinated clusters (called cells) to jointly serve the users. However,
such fixed systems are plagued by the so-called cell-edge problem: near the
boundaries, the interference between neighboring clusters can result in very
poor interference-to-signal-power ratios. To achieve a high quality service, it
is an important objective to minimize the sum of these ratios over the cells.
  The most common approach to solve this minimization problem is arguably the
spectral clustering method. In this paper, we propose a new clustering
approach, which is deterministic and computationally much less demanding than
current methods. Simulating on synthetic instances indicates that our methods
typically provide higher quality solutions than earlier methods.
  An earlier version of this algorithm was reported in arXiv:2111.00885.

and elasticity, taking the infrastructure management burden away from users,
and enabling a pay-as-you-use billing model. As a result, Serverless is
becoming increasingly popular, and new use cases have recently been proposed.
Examples include video and image processing, Machine Learning inference and
training, and data analytics. However, Serverless is currently supported by
bloated virtualization stacks composed of a combination of virtual machines
and/or containers, and language runtimes. None of these were to host
lightweight and fast-executing Serverless workloads.
  To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Graalvisor, a
virtualized polyglot language runtime capable of running multiple concurrent
functions with minimal overhead. Graalvisor is designed to efficiently run
lightweight and short-running Serverless functions, each running in a tiny
execution environment that launches under 500 us. A single Graalvisor instance
can run thousands of functions written in many different languages. By
virtualizing a single runtime across many function invocations, Graalvisor
reduces virtualization stack redundancy, resulting in lower memory consumption
and less cold-starts. On a set of established Serverless functions, Graalvisor
improves the throughput per memory (ops/sec/GB) on average by 170$\times$ for
Java functions, 26.6$\times$ for JavaScript functions, and 2.07$\times$ for
Python functions. When reproducing a public Serverless trace, Graalvisor
reduces the overall memory footprint by 83% and reduces the tail latency (99
percentile) by 68%.

variations of intensity that make it difficult to simultaneously visualize the
features present at all levels and scales. Many general-purpose and specialized
filters have been proposed to enhance coronal images. However, most of them
require the ad hoc tweaking of parameters to produce subjectively good results.
Our aim was to develop a general purpose image enhancement technique that would
produce equally good results, but based on an objective criterion. The
underlying principle of the method is the equalization, or whitening, of power
in the {\it \`a trous} wavelet spectrum of the input image at all scales and
locations. An edge-avoiding modification of the {\it \`a trous} transform that
uses bilateral weighting by the local variance in the wavelet planes is used to
suppress the undesirable halos otherwise produced by discontinuities in the
data. Results are presented for a variety of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and
white light images of the solar corona. The proposed filter produces sharp and
contrasted output, without requiring the manual adjustment of parameters.
Furthermore, the built-in denoising scheme prevents the explosion of
high-frequency noise typical of other enhancement methods, without smoothing
statistically significant small-scale features. The standard version of the
algorithm is about two times faster than the widely used multiscale Gaussian
normalization (MGN). The bilateral version is slower, but provides
significantly better results in the presence of spikes or edges. Comparisons
with other methods suggest that the whitening principle may correspond to the
subjective criterion of most users when adjusting free parameters.

recommendation scenarios, as it erodes the user's trust in the RS. In contrast,
the newly introduced Tsetlin Machines (TM) possess some valuable properties due
to their inherent interpretability. TMs are still fairly young as a technology.
As no RS has been developed for TMs before, it has become necessary to perform
some preliminary research regarding the practicality of such a system. In this
paper, we develop the first RS based on TMs to evaluate its practicality in
this application domain. This paper compares the viability of TMs with other
machine learning models prevalent in the field of RS. We train and investigate
the performance of the TM compared with a vanilla feed-forward deep learning
model. These comparisons are based on model performance,
interpretability/explainability, and scalability. Further, we provide some
benchmark performance comparisons to similar machine learning solutions

recorded data arbitrarily well from inaccurate subsurface models. To achieve
this goal, the simulated wavefields can be computed in an extended search space
as the solution of an overdetermined problem aiming at jointly satisfying the
wave equation and fitting the data in a least-squares sense. Simply put, the
wavefields are computed by solving the wave equation in the inaccurate
background model with a feedback term to the data added to the physical source
in the right-hand side. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated by
canceling out these additional source terms, sometimes called unwisely
wave-equation errors, to push the background model toward the true model in the
left-hand side wave-equation operator. Although many studies were devoted to
these approaches with promising numerical results, their governing physical
principles and their relationships with classical FWI don't seem to be
understood well yet. The goal of this tutorial is to review these principles in
the theoretical framework of inverse scattering theory whose governing forward
equation is the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. From this equation, we show how
the data-assimilated wavefields embed an approximation of the scattered field
generated by the sought model perturbation and how they modify the sensitivity
kernel of classical FWI beyond the Born approximation. We also clarify how the
approximation with which these wavefields approximate the unknown true
wavefields is accounted for in the adjoint source of the parameter estimation
problem. The theory is finally illustrated with numerical examples.
Understanding the physical principles governing these methods is a necessary
prerequisite to assessing their potential and limits and designing relevant
heuristics to manage the latter.

validation of an argument-based model for opinion dynamics in which biased
processing is the principle mechanism. While previous work has focused on
calibrating the micro mechanism with experimental data on argument-induced
opinion change, this paper concentrates on macro-level validity using the
empirical data gathered in the survey experiment. For this purpose, the
argument model is extended by an external source of balanced information which
allows to control for the impact of peer influence processes relative to other
noisy processes. We show that surveyed opinion distributions are matched with a
high level of accuracy in a specific region in the parameter space, indicating
an equal impact of social influence and external noise. More importantly, the
estimated strength of biased processing given the macro data is compatible with
those values that achieve high likelihood at the micro level. The main
contribution of the paper is hence to show that the extended argument-based
model provides a solid bridge from the micro processes of argument-induced
attitude change to macro level opinion distributions. Beyond that, we review

  Vocabulary Video Object Detection","ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scaling object taxonomies is one of the important steps toward a robust
real-world deployment of recognition systems. We have faced remarkable progress
in images since the introduction of the LVIS benchmark. To continue this
success in videos, a new video benchmark, TAO, was recently presented. Given
the recent encouraging results from both detection and tracking communities, we
are interested in marrying those two advances and building a strong large
vocabulary video tracker. However, supervisions in LVIS and TAO are inherently
sparse or even missing, posing two new challenges for training the large
vocabulary trackers. First, no tracking supervisions are in LVIS, which leads
to inconsistent learning of detection (with LVIS and TAO) and tracking (only
with TAO). Second, the detection supervisions in TAO are partial, which results
in catastrophic forgetting of absent LVIS categories during video fine-tuning.
To resolve these challenges, we present a simple but effective learning
framework that takes full advantage of all available training data to learn
detection and tracking while not losing any LVIS categories to recognize. With
this new learning scheme, we show that consistent improvements of various large
vocabulary trackers are capable, setting strong baseline results on the
challenging TAO benchmarks.

multi-object tracking and works by detecting objects in each frame and then
performing data association across frames. However, its sequential frame-wise
matching property fundamentally suffers from the intermediate interruptions in
a video, such as object occlusions, fast camera movements, and abrupt light
changes. Moreover, it typically overlooks temporal information beyond the two
frames for matching. In this paper, we investigate an alternative by treating
object association as clip-wise matching. Our new perspective views a single
long video sequence as multiple short clips, and then the tracking is performed
both within and between the clips. The benefits of this new approach are two
folds. First, our method is robust to tracking error accumulation or
propagation, as the video chunking allows bypassing the interrupted frames, and
the short clip tracking avoids the conventional error-prone long-term track
memory management. Second, the multiple frame information is aggregated during
the clip-wise matching, resulting in a more accurate long-range track
association than the current frame-wise matching. Given the state-of-the-art
tracking-by-detection tracker, QDTrack, we showcase how the tracking
performance improves with our new tracking formulation. We evaluate our
proposals on two tracking benchmarks, TAO and MOT17 that have complementary
characteristics and challenges each other.

performed by starting from a range of practical observations and experimental
data. We then work our way through the investigation of the key mechanisms
which play a role in the overall process. In turn, these mechanisms reveal an
array of fundamental interactions, such as particle-fluid, particle-particle
and particle-surface, whose combined effects create the tapestry of current
applications. At the core of this analysis are descriptions of these physical
phenomena and the different ways through which they are intertwined to build up
various models used to provide quantitative assessment of particle
resuspension. The physics of particle resuspension implies to hold together
processes occurring at extremely different space and time scales and models are
key in providing a single vehicle to lead us through such multiscale journeys.
This raises questions on what makes up a model and one objective of the present
work is to clarify the essence of a modeling approach. In spite of its
ubiquitous nature, particle resuspension is still at the early stages of
developments. Many extensions need to be worked out and revisiting the art of
modeling is not a moot point. The need to consider more complex objects than
small and spherical particles and, moreover, to come up with unified
descriptions of mono- and multilayer resuspension put the emphasis on solid
model foundations if we are to go beyond current limits. This is very much
modeling in the making and new ideas are proposed to stimulate interest into

practical importance in natural language understanding, linguists have yet to
agree on a single, prominent framework for the categorization of modal verb
senses. This lack of agreement stems from high degrees of flexibility and
polysemy from the modal verbs, making it more difficult for researchers to
incorporate insights from this family of words into their work. This work
presents Moverb dataset, which consists of 27,240 annotations of modal verb
senses over 4,540 utterances containing one or more sentences from social

different theoretical frameworks (i.e., Quirk and Palmer) of modal verb senses.
We observe that both frameworks have similar inter-annotator agreements,
despite having different numbers of sense types (8 for Quirk and 3 for Palmer).
With the RoBERTa-based classifiers fine-tuned on \dataset, we achieve F1 scores
of 82.2 and 78.3 on Quirk and Palmer, respectively, showing that modal verb

focus of the literature is on the unweighted and structurally balanced ones,

introduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced or
strictly balanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in
terms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In
particular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is
smaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly
unbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed
networks, both linear and nonlinear ones. Specifically, we find consistent
patterns in a linear and a nonlinear dynamics theoretically, depending on their
type of balance. We also propose two measures to further characterize strictly
unbalanced networks, motivated by perturbation theory. Finally, we numerically
verify these properties through experiments on both synthetic and real

example, injectivity of modules over non-Noetherian commutative rings is not
preserved by localizations, while homotopy injectivity of complexes of modules
is not preserved by localizations even for Noetherian rings. The latter also
applies to the contraadjustedness and cotorsion properties. All the mentioned

is antilocal. If the right class in a cotorsion theory for contraadjusted

and is based on the assumption that such attributes are a (noisy) proxy for
student behavior. We hence propose to directly oversample different types of
behaviors identified in a cluster analysis. We evaluate our approaches on data
from (i) an open-ended learning environment and (ii) a flipped classroom
course. Our results show that both approaches can mitigate model bias. Directly
oversampling on behavior is a valuable alternative, when demographic metadata

  under review as of December 2022",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Mapping the seafloor with underwater imaging cameras is of significant
importance for various applications including marine engineering, geology,
geomorphology, archaeology and biology. For shallow waters, among the
underwater imaging challenges, caustics i.e., the complex physical phenomena
resulting from the projection of light rays being refracted by the wavy
surface, is likely the most crucial one. Caustics is the main factor during
underwater imaging campaigns that massively degrade image quality and affect
severely any 2D mosaicking or 3D reconstruction of the seabed. In this work, we
propose a novel method for correcting the radiometric effects of caustics on
shallow underwater imagery. Contrary to the state-of-the-art, the developed
method can handle seabed and riverbed of any anaglyph, correcting the images
using real pixel information, thus, improving image matching and 3D
reconstruction processes. In particular, the developed method employs deep
learning architectures in order to classify image pixels to ""non-caustics"" and
""caustics"". Then, exploits the 3D geometry of the scene to achieve a pixel-wise
correction, by transferring appropriate color values between the overlapping
underwater images. Moreover, to fill the current gap, we have collected,
annotated and structured a real-world caustic dataset, namely R-CAUSTIC, which
is openly available. Overall, based on the experimental results and validation
the developed methodology is quite promising in both detecting caustics and
reconstructing their intensity.

the recently proposed Hoyer regularizer. We estimate the threshold of each SNN
layer as the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of its activation map, where
the clipping threshold is trained using gradient descent with our Hoyer
regularizer. This approach not only downscales the value of the trainable
threshold, thereby emitting a large number of spikes for weight update with a
limited number of iterations (due to only one time step) but also shifts the
membrane potential values away from the threshold, thereby mitigating the
effect of noise that can degrade the SNN accuracy. Our approach outperforms
existing spiking, binary, and adder neural networks in terms of the

is a critical tool for scene motion estimation. Correlation volume is the
central component of optical flow computational neural models. It estimates the
pairwise matching costs between cross-frame features, and is then used to
decode optical flow. However, traditional correlation volume is frequently
noisy, outlier-prone, and sensitive to motion blur. We observe that, although
the recent RAFT algorithm also adopts the traditional correlation volume, its
additional context encoder provides semantically representative features to the
flow decoder, implicitly compensating for the deficiency of the correlation
volume. However, the benefits of this context encoder has been barely discussed
or exploited. In this paper, we first investigate the functionality of RAFT's
context encoder, then propose a new Context Guided Correlation Volume (CGCV)
via gating and lifting schemes. CGCV can be universally integrated with
RAFT-based flow computation methods for enhanced performance, especially
effective in the presence of motion blur, de-focus blur and atmospheric

topological insulators. This concept has recently been generalized to
$2^n$-root topology, characterizing models where $n$ squaring operations must
be applied to the Hamiltonian in order to arrive at the topological source of
the model. In this paper, we analyze the Hofstadter regime of
quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) and two-dimensional (2D) $2^n$-root models,
the latter of which has the square lattice (SL) (known for the Hofstadter
Butterfly) as the source model. We show that upon increasing the root-degree of
the model, there appear multiple magnetic flux insensitive flat bands, and
analytically determine corresponding eigenstates. These can be recast as
compact localized states (CLSs) occupying a finite region of the lattice. For a
finite flux, these CLSs correspond to different harmonics contained within the
same Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage. Furthermore, as the root-degree increases, a
kaleidoscope of butterflies is seen to appear in the Hofstadter diagram, with
each butterfly constituting a topologically equivalent replica of the original
one of the SL. As such, the index $n$, which uniquely identifies the
root-degree of the model, can be seen as an additional fractal dimension of the
$2^n$-root model present in its Hofstadter diagram. We discuss how these
dynamics could be realized in experiments with ultracold atoms, and measured by
Bragg spectroscopy or through observing dynamics of initially localized atoms

efficient orbital circularization due to tidal interaction during the previous
mass transfer phase. Therefore, BMSPs are expected to have a circular orbit.
However, the discovery of several eccentric BMSPs (eBMSPs) with a white dwarf
(WD) companion has challenged this picture. In particular, recent observation
reveals that the spin angular momentum of the eBMSP J0955$-$6150 is tilted at
an angle $>4.8^{\rm \degree}$ from the orbital angular momentum. This is the
first time that a tilt angle is deduced for eBMSPs, which provides an important
clue to their formation mechanism. Both the orbital eccentricity and tilt angle
could be qualitatively accounted for by asymmetrical mass ejection during
thermonuclear flashes from proto-WDs (so-called the thermonuclear rocket
model), but detailed studies are still lacking. In this paper, we simulate the
impact of the kick caused by asymmetrical mass ejection on the properties of
BMSPs. We find that the thermonuclear rocket model can potentially explain the
observational characteristics of both eBMSPs and normal BMSPs under reasonable
input parameters. In addition, our results predict a wide range of the orbital
period (from less than one day to more than several hundred days) for eBMSPs,

fixed \emph{a priori} and, finally, a Reisser-Nordstr\""{o}m spacetime with an
additional cosmological constant contribution. We perform Markov chain Monte
Carlo analyses, based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and infer
1--$\sigma$ and 2--$\sigma$ error bars. For all the sources, we find suitable
agreement with spherical solutions with non-zero cosmological constant terms,
\textit{i.e.}, with either de Sitter or anti-de Sitter solutions. From our
findings, we notice that the existence of topological contribution to the net
charge, suggested from $F(R)$ extensions of gravity, seems to be disfavored.
Finally, we focus on the physics of the cosmological constant term here
involved, investigating physical consequences and proposing possible extensions
to improve our overall treatments.

prevent the emotion of the generated speech from being interfered by the
emotional components in the original speech, a neutral content generator is
proposed to remove the emotion from the original speech, which is optimized by
the generative adversarial framework. Thirdly, two data augmentation methods
are proposed to enrich the emotional and pronunciation information in the
training set, which can enable the model to edit the unseen speaker's speech.

energy-efficient neural networks by replacing the expensive multiplications in
convolution with cheaper additions (i.e.l1-norm). To achieve higher hardware
efficiency, it is necessary to further study the low-bit quantization of
AdderNet. Due to the limitation that the commutative law in multiplication does
not hold in l1-norm, the well-established quantization methods on convolutional
networks cannot be applied on AdderNets. Thus, the existing AdderNet
quantization techniques propose to use only one shared scale to quantize both
the weights and activations simultaneously. Admittedly, such an approach can
keep the commutative law in the l1-norm quantization process, while the
accuracy drop after low-bit quantization cannot be ignored. To this end, we
first thoroughly analyze the difference on distributions of weights and
activations in AdderNet and then propose a new quantization algorithm by
redistributing the weights and the activations. Specifically, the pre-trained
full-precision weights in different kernels are clustered into different
groups, then the intra-group sharing and inter-group independent scales can be
adopted. To further compensate the accuracy drop caused by the distribution
difference, we then develop a lossless range clamp scheme for weights and a
simple yet effective outliers clamp strategy for activations. Thus, the
functionality of full-precision weights and the representation ability of
full-precision activations can be fully preserved. The effectiveness of the
proposed quantization method for AdderNet is well verified on several
benchmarks, e.g., our 4-bit post-training quantized adder ResNet-18 achieves an
66.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet with comparable energy efficiency, which
is about 8.5% higher than that of the previous AdderNet quantization methods.

Specifically, a text-to-speech (TTS) system is first pretrained with
target-accented speech data. This TTS model and its hidden representations are
expected to be associated only with the target accent. Then, a speech encoder
is trained to convert the accent of the speech under the supervision of the

corresponding transcription are forwarded to the speech encoder and the
pretrained TTS, respectively. The output of the speech encoder is optimized to
be the same as the text embedding in the TTS system. At run-time, the speech
encoder is combined with the pretrained TTS decoder to convert the
source-accented speech toward the target. In the experiments, we converted
English with two source accents (Chinese and Indian) to the target accent
(American/British/Canadian). Both objective metrics and subjective listening
tests successfully validate that, without any parallel data, the proposed

relation that generates this factorization. To obtain lattices rather than
arbitrary ordered sets, we restrict this approach to so-called pure intervals.
For our study, we will make use of methods from Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).
We will also provide a new FCA construction by introducing the enrichment of an
incidence relation by a set of intervals in a formal context, to investigate
the approach for lattice-generating interval relations on the context side.

mechanical initial data correspond to travelling waves that turn asymptotically
into standing waves whose phases only depend on the evolution of the gauge
coupling. We point out that these gauge analogs of the Sakharov oscillations
are exchanged by the duality symmetry and ultimately constrain both the
relative scaling of the hypermagnetic power spectra and their final asymptotic
values. Unlike the case of the density contrasts in a relativistic plasma, the
standing oscillations never develop since they are eventually overdamped by the
finite value of the conductivity as soon as the corresponding modes are
comparable with the expansion rates after inflation. We show that the late-time
value of the magnetic field is not determined at radiation dominance (and in
spite of the value of the wavenumber) but it depends on the moment when the
wavelengths (comparable with the Mpc) get of the order of the Hubble radius
before equality. This means that the magnetogenesis requirements are only
relaxed if the post-inflationary expansion rate is slower than radiation but
the opposite is true when the plasma expands faster than radiation and the
corresponding power spectra are further suppressed. After combining the present
findings with the evolution of the gauge coupling we show that these results
are consistent with a magnetogenesis scenario where the gauge coupling is
always perturbative during the inflationary stage while, in the dual case, the
same requirements cannot be satisfied.

estimated that a super-flare on G-type dwarfs of energy of $10^{35}$ erg occurs

enable physical simulations of highly correlated electron states in molecules

a hardware-efficient toolbox for ground state simulation; however, with
limitations in precision. Even in the absence of noise, the algorithm may
result into a biased energy estimation, particularly with some shallower ansatz
types. Noise additionally degrades entanglement and hinders the ground state
energy estimation (especially if the noise is not fully characterized). Here we
develop a method to exploit the quantum-classical interface provided by
informationally complete measurements to use classical software on top of the
hardware entanglement booster for ansatz- and noise-related error reduction. We
use the tensor network representation of a quantum channel that drives the
noisy state toward the ground one. The tensor network is a completely positive
map by construction, but we elaborate on making the trace preservation
condition local so as to activate the sweeping variational optimization. This
method brings into reach energies below the noiseless ansatz by creating
additional correlations among the qubits and denoising them. Analyzing the
example of the stretched water molecule with a tangible entanglement, we argue
that a hybrid strategy of using the quantum hardware together with the
classical software outperforms a purely classical strategy provided the
classical parts have the same bond dimension. The proposed optimization
algorithm extends the variety of noise mitigation methods and facilitates the
more accurate study of the energy landscape for deformed molecules. The
algorithm can be applied as the final postprocessing step in the quantum
hardware simulation of protein-ligand complexes in the context of drug design.

recent years and have been deployed in a wide range of applications. It is
crucial to understand the robustness of detectors against adversarial attacks
when employing detectors in security-critical applications. In this paper, we
make the first attempt to conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the
robustness of 3D detectors under adversarial attacks. Specifically, we first
extend three kinds of adversarial attacks to the 3D object detection task to
benchmark the robustness of state-of-the-art 3D object detectors against
attacks on KITTI and Waymo datasets, subsequently followed by the analysis of
the relationship between robustness and properties of detectors. Then, we
explore the transferability of cross-model, cross-task, and cross-data attacks.
We finally conduct comprehensive experiments of defense for 3D detectors,
demonstrating that simple transformations like flipping are of little help in
improving robustness when the strategy of transformation imposed on input point
cloud data is exposed to attackers. Our findings will facilitate investigations
in understanding and defending the adversarial attacks against 3D object
detectors to advance this field.

prioritizing model depth over width and allocating more layers in the encoder

spin-1/2 doublet state with an odd number of electrons. Considering the
difference between spin of the even and odd states, spin-filtered measurements

non-polarized tunnel junction in a three-terminal circuit. We observe a
spin-polarized excitation spectrum of the ABS, which in some cases is fully

come. The Internet generates huge amounts of data every day. However,
extracting meaningful information from massive data is like looking for a
needle in a haystack. Data mining techniques can provide various feasible
methods to solve this problem. At present, many sequential rule mining (SRM)
algorithms are presented to find sequential rules in databases with sequential
characteristics. These rules help people extract a lot of meaningful
information from massive amounts of data. How can we achieve compression of
mined results and reduce data size to save storage space and transmission time?
Until now, there has been little research on the compression of SRM. In this
paper, combined with the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and under
the two metrics (support and confidence), we introduce the problem of
compression of SRM and also propose a solution named ComSR for MDL-based
compressing of sequential rules based on the designed sequential rule coding
scheme. To our knowledge, we are the first to use sequential rules to encode an
entire database. A heuristic method is proposed to find a set of compact and
meaningful sequential rules as much as possible. ComSR has two trade-off
algorithms, ComSR_non and ComSR_ful, based on whether the database can be
completely compressed. Experiments done on a real dataset with different
thresholds show that a set of compact and meaningful sequential rules can be
found. This shows that the proposed method works.

translationese may occur on either source or target side. We compare the impact

outperforms its target-original counterpart. Moreover, since the WMT corpus
lacks direction information for each parallel sentence, we train a classifier

using source-original parallel data for QE data augmentation, which brings a

properties of rectangular phosphorene nanorings for both symmetrically and

phosphorene-based nanostructures to enhance the TE performance in the absence

zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons (ZPNRs) are coupled symmetrically to rectangular
rings, a comparatively large band gap is induced in the electronic conductance
due to the suppression of the contribution of edge states. This gives rise to a
remarkable increase in the thermopower response compared to the case of
pristine ZPNRs. More intriguingly, we found that though the maximum power
factor in this system is about the same as the one for its ZPNR counterpart,
the much smaller electronic thermal conductance of this phosphorene-based
nanostructure can remarkably contribute to the improvement of the figure of
merit. Also, we found that the symmetry/asymmetry of our designed
nanostructures, the geometrical characteristics of the ring, and the magnetic
flux are three important factors that control the thermoelectric properties of
phosphorene quantum rings. Our numerical calculations show that by changing the
magnetic flux through the nanoring, a drastic increase in the thermopower is
observed near an antiresonance point. We demonstrate the tunability of the
thermopower and the possibility to switch on and off the TE response of
phosphorene nanorings with the magnetic flux. Moreover, for asymmetric
connection configurations with armchair-edged leads, we found that though the
thermopower is almost intact, a remarkable reduction of the electronic thermal

However, fully supervised deep learning methods require datasets to be
point-wise annotated, which is extremely expensive and time-consuming. In our
work, we proposed a novel weakly supervised framework, Eff-3DPSeg, for 3D plant
shoot segmentation. First, high-resolution point clouds of soybean were
reconstructed using a low-cost photogrammetry system, and the Meshlab-based
Plant Annotator was developed for plant point cloud annotation. Second, a
weakly-supervised deep learning method was proposed for plant organ
segmentation. The method contained: (1) Pretraining a self-supervised network
using Viewpoint Bottleneck loss to learn meaningful intrinsic structure
representation from the raw point clouds; (2) Fine-tuning the pre-trained model
with about only 0.5% points being annotated to implement plant organ
segmentation. After, three phenotypic traits (stem diameter, leaf width, and
leaf length) were extracted. To test the generality of the proposed method, the
public dataset Pheno4D was included in this study. Experimental results showed
that the weakly-supervised network obtained similar segmentation performance
compared with the fully-supervised setting. Our method achieved 95.1%, 96.6%,
95.8% and 92.2% in the Precision, Recall, F1-score, and mIoU for stem leaf

robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no

on docstrings, function and variable names, code syntax, and code format. They
are carefully designed to be natural in real-life coding practice, preserve the
original semantic meaning, and thus provide multifaceted assessments of a

90% of the perturbed prompts do not alter the semantic meaning of the original

considering the worst-case behavior under each type of perturbation, taking
advantage of the fact that executing the generated code can serve as objective
evaluation. We demonstrate ReCode on SOTA models using HumanEval, MBPP, as well
as function completion tasks derived from them. Interesting observations
include: better robustness for CodeGen over InCoder and GPT-J; models are most

This area is characterized by even-aged and mono-specific stands, of a typical

prototypical situation where the aromatic ring can act as an hydrogen bond
acceptor (via the $\pi$ electron density) and/or a hydrogen bond donor (via the
CH groups), with the potential for cooperative effects. Our analysis places
benzene at the centre of our frame-of-reference, and reveals for the first time
that in solution the O-H$\cdots\pi$ interaction is highly localised and
directional, the hydrogen atom being located directly above/below the ring
centroid at a distance of 2.30 {\AA} and with the hydroxyl bond axis normal to
the aromatic plane. The tendency of methanol to form chain and cyclic motifs in
the bulk liquid is manifest in a highly templated, symmetrical equatorial
solvation structure; the methanol molecules surround the benzene so that the
O-H bonds are coplanar with the aromatic ring while the oxygens interact with
C-H groups through simultaneous bifurcated hydrogen bonds. By contrast,
C-H$\cdots\pi$ interactions are relegated to the role of more distant
spectators. The experimentally observed solvation therefore demonstrates that
weak hydrogen bonding can give rise to strongly-ordered cooperative structural
motifs also in the liquid phase.

given the major concerns for environmental safety and the likelihood for
increased public health risks. An important aspect of this process consists in
locating abnormal signals, from a large amount of collected data. This kind of
data is usually complex since it suffers from limits of quantification leading
to left censored observations, and from the sampling procedure which is
irregular in time and space across measuring stations. The present manuscript
tackles precisely the issue of detecting spatio-temporal collective anomalies
in pesticide concentration levels, and introduces a novel methodology for
dealing with spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The latter combines a change-point
detection procedure applied to the series of maximum daily values across all
stations, and a clustering step aimed at a spatial segmentation of the
stations. Limits of quantification are handled in the change-point procedure,
by supposing an underlying left-censored parametric model, piece-wise
stationary. Spatial segmentation takes into account the geographical
conditions, and may be based on river network, wind directions, etc.
Conditionally to the temporal segment and the spatial cluster, one may
eventually analyse the data and identify contextual anomalies. The proposed
procedure is illustrated in detail on a data set containing the prosulfocarb
concentration levels in surface waters in Centre-Val de Loire region.

  In this paper we will answer this question adopting the point of view of
measure theory, introducing the optimal transport problem between complex
algebraic projective hypersurfaces.
  First, a natural topological embedding of the space of hypersurfaces of a
given degree into the space of measures on the projective space is constructed.
Then, the optimal transport problem between hypersurfaces is defined through a
constrained dynamical formulation, minimizing the energy of absolutely
continuous curves which lie on the image of this embedding. In this way an
inner Wasserstein distance on the projective space of homogeneous polynomials
is introduced. This distance is complete and geodesic: geodesics corresponds to
optimal deformations of one algebraic hypersurface into another one. Outside
the discriminant this distance is induced by a smooth Riemannian metric, which
is the real part of an explicit Hermitian structure. The topology induced by
the inner Wasserstein distance is finer than the Fubini-Study one.
  To prove these results we develop new techniques, which combine complex and
symplectic geometry with optimal transport, and which we expect to be relevant
on their own. We discuss applications on the regularity of the zeroes of a
family of multivariate polynomials and on the condition number of polynomial
systems solving.

decoding is performed. We demonstrate the quality and generality of our

\gamma^*}$ for the neutral pseudoscalar mesons $P=\pi^0$ and $\eta$. The
calculation is performed using twisted-mass lattice QCD with physical quark
masses. On the lattice, we have access to a broad range of (space-like) photon
four-momenta and therefore produce form factor data complementary to the
experimentally accessible single-virtual direction, which directly leads to an
estimate of the pion- and $\eta$-pole components of the muon $g-2$. For the
pion, our result for the $g-2$ contribution in the continuum is comparable with
previous lattice and data-driven determinations, with combined relative
uncertainties below $10\%$. For the $\eta$ meson, we report on a preliminary
determination from a single lattice spacing.

unify elastic motions of solids with viscous motions of liquids in the
continuum mechanics perspective. But rigorous proofs are lacking. The present
note is a contribution toward well-defined viscoelastic flows proved to
encompass both solid and (liquid) fluid regimes. In a first part, we consider
the structural stability of particular viscoelastic flows: 1D shear waves
solutions to damped wave equations. We show the convergence toward purely
elastic 1D shear waves solutions to standard wave equations, as the relaxation
time $\lambda$ and the viscosity $\mu$ grow unboundedly $\lambda$ $\not\equiv$
$\mu$/G $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ in Maxwell's constitutive equation $\lambda$
$\tau$ +$\tau$ = 2 $\mu$D(u) for the stress $\tau$ of viscoelastic fluids with

multi-dimensional viscoelastic flows. To that aim, we embed Maxwell's
constitutive equation in a symmetric-hyperbolic system of PDEs which we
proposed in our previous publication [ESAIM:M2AN 55 (2021) 807-831]so as to
define multi-dimensional viscoelastic flows unequivocally. Next, we show the
continuous dependence of multi-dimensional viscoelastic flows on $\lambda$

[TAs]- antifluorite layer that can be non-magnetic semiconducting (T = Zn),
magnetic semiconducting (T = Mn), or magnetic metallic (T = Fe).
Antiferromagnetic transitions at TN ~ 2.4 - 3 K due to an ordering of the Eu2+
magnetic moments were confirmed in all three EuTAsF compounds. Whereas in
EuTAsF (T = Zn and Mn), the commensurate k1 = (1/2 1/2 0) stripe order pattern
with magnetic moments within the ab-plane is observed, the order in EuFeAsF is
incommensurate with k = (0 0.961(1) 1/2) and represents a cycloid of Eu2+
magnetic moments confined within the bc-plane. Additionally, the Mn2+
sublattice in EuMnAsF features a robust G-type antiferromagnetic order that
persists at least up to room temperature, with magnetic moments along the
c-direction. Although DFT calculations suggest stripe antiferromagnetic order
in the Fe-sublattice of EuFeAsF as the ground state, neutron diffraction
reveals no evidence of long-range magnetic order associated with Fe. We show
that the frustrating interplane interaction J3 between the adjacent [EuF]+
layers is comparable with in-plane J1-J2 interactions already in the case of
semiconducting fluorite layers [TAs]- (T = Zn and Mn) and becomes dominant in
the case of the metallic [FeAs]- ones. The latter, along with a slight
orthorhombic distortion, is proposed to be the origin of the incommensurate
magnetic structure observed in EuFeAsF.

However, many of these approaches suffer from high computational costs due to

introduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task

include instructions in the model input. The hypernetwork in HINT also produces
an encoded instruction, which we concatenate with encoded inputs during
decoding to further improve performance. HINT models outperform strong
state-of-the-art baselines by over 10% when controlling for compute (measured
in FLOPs). By converting instructions into modules, HINT models can effectively
disregard the length of instructions and few-shot example inputs in terms of
compute usage. As a result, HINT can enhance its performance by up to 25% by
incorporating additional few-shot data, while utilizing only up to 5% more
compute. This combines the strengths of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and

gravitational wave anisotropies of cosmological origin: for adiabatic initial
conditions, their angular power spectrum is insensitive to the equation of
state of the cosmic fluid driving the expansion before big-bang
nucleosynthesis. Any deviation from this universal behaviour points to the
presence of non-adiabatic sources of primordial fluctuations. Such scenarios
can be tested by gravitational wave detectors operating at a frequency range
which is fully complementary to CMB experiments. In this work we prove this
general result, and we illustrate its consequences for a representative
realisation of initial conditions based on the curvaton scenario. In the case
of the simplest curvaton setup, we also find a significant cross-correlation
between gravitational wave anisotropies and the CMB temperature fluctuations.
There is a fourfold enhancement vis-\`{a}-vis the purely adiabatic scenario. We
discuss the implications of our findings for identifying the origin of the
(cosmological) gravitational wave background when, as is often the case, this
cannot be determined solely on the basis of its spectral shape.

(RadIT), when ionizing radiations are used to reveal internal structures of
materials. Since its invention by R\""ontgen, RadIT now come in many modalities
such as absorption-based X-ray radiography, phase contrast X-ray imaging,
coherent X-ray diffractive imaging, high-energy X- and $\gamma-$ray radiography
at above 1 MeV, X-ray computed tomography (CT), proton imaging and tomography
(IT), neutron IT, positron emission tomography (PET), high-energy electron
radiography, muon tomography, etc. Spatial, temporal resolution, sensitivity,
and radiation hardness, among others, are common metrics for RadIT performance,
which are enabled by, in addition to scintillators, advances in high-luminosity
accelerators and high-power lasers, photodetectors especially CMOS pixelated
sensor arrays, and lately data science. Medical imaging, nondestructive
testing, nuclear safety and safeguards are traditional RadIT applications.
Examples of growing or emerging applications include space, additive
manufacturing, machine vision, and virtual reality or `metaverse'. Scintillator
metrics such as light yield and decay time are correlated to RadIT metrics.
More than 160 kinds of scintillators and applications are presented during the
SCINT22 conference. New trends include inorganic and organic scintillator
heterostructures, liquid phase synthesis of perovskites and $\mu$m-thick films,
use of multiphysics models and data science to guide scintillator development,
structural innovations such as photonic crystals, nanoscintillators enhanced by
the Purcell effect, novel scintillator fibers, and multilayer configurations.
Opportunities exist through optimization of RadIT with reduced radiation dose,
data-driven measurements, photon/particle counting and tracking methods
supplementing time-integrated measurements, and multimodal RadIT.

investigations on the spectral domain with experiments performed with
wavelength drivers varied from deep-ultraviolet (258 nm) to mid-infrared (3.5
$\mu$m). The measured fluence thresholds for single shot ablation in
dielectrics using 200-fs pulses exhibit a plateau extending from the visible
domain up to 3.5-$\mu$m wavelength. This is accompanied, after ablation crater
analysis, by a remarkable invariance of the observed ablation precision and
efficiency. Only at the shortest tested wavelength of 258 nm, a twofold
decrease of the ablation threshold and significant changes of the machining
depths are detected. This defines a lower spectral limit of the
wavelength-independence of the ablation process. By comparison with

paper, starting from the density-matrix equations of motion, we present a
general theoretical path to obtain nonlinear optical responses elegantly and
transparently. We devise a kinetic theory applicable to materials with
arbitrary band structures and captures intraband and interband coherence
effects, finite Fermi surfaces, and disorder effects. We present a
classification of nonlinear optical currents arising from the interference of
interband and intraband components of the density matrix with distinct symmetry
and quantum geometrical origin for each contribution. In this context, we
report four findings. (i) The Fermi Golden Rule approach is insufficient to
derive the correct expression for the injection current, a shortcoming that we
remedy in our theory while associating the injection current with the
intraband-interband contribution to the second-order density matrix. (ii) The
interband-intraband contribution yields a resonant current that survives
irrespective of any symmetry constraint in addition to the well-known anomalous
nonlinear current (non-resonant), which requires time-reversal symmetry. (iii)
Quite generally, the nonlinear current is significantly enhanced by
contributions from the finite Fermi surface. (iv) The finite Fermi surface and
Fermi sea additionally lead to sizable novel nonlinear effects via
contributions we term double resonant and higher-order pole. As an
illustration, we compute the nonlinear response of topological antiferromagnet
CuMnAs and thin film tilted Weyl semimetals dominated by interband coherence
effects. We find that the nonlinear response of CuMnAs is responsive to the
direction of finite magnetization field and choice of the polarization angle of

flares from inactive galaxies. The early X-ray observations with ROSAT also
established the extreme X-ray spectral softness of these events with
temperatures of order 50-100 eV that continues to be seen in the majority of
more recently identified events. While the majority of X-ray TDEs has been
identified from {\it inactive} galaxies and some showed the highest amplitudes
of variability recorded from galaxy cores (amplitudes exceeding factors of
1000--6000), a small fraction of {\it active} galactic nuclei (AGN) has been
found to be highly variable as well. In AGN, this so-called changing-look
phenomenon often comes with a strong change in the optical broad emission
lines, leading to Seyfert-type changes between class 1 and class 2. These two
forms of activity represent the extremes of variability among active and
quiescent galaxies, and have opened up a new window on understanding accretion
physics under extreme conditions. Finally, we introduce the term ``frozen-look
AGN'' to describe systems that show constant line emission despite
strong/dramatic changes in the observed ionizing continuum. These systems are
best explained by strong changes of absorption along our line-of-sight.

at arbitrary temperatures, specifically ambient conditions more relevant to

$\omega_\eta$, where $\omega$ is the frequency of the oscillator,
$\Tilde{\omega}$ is a type of cyclotron frequency, and $\omega_\theta$ and
$\omega_\eta$ are the noncommutative frequencies of position and momentum. With
respect to entropy, we note an increase with the temperature and
$\omega_\theta$, and a decrease with $\omega$, $\Tilde{\omega}$, $\omega_\eta$.
Now, with respect to mean energy, we note that such property increases linearly
with the temperature, and their values for the relativistic case are twice that
of the nonrelativistic case. As a direct consequence of this, the value of the
heat capacity for the relativistic case is also twice that of the
nonrelativistic case, and both are constants, thus satisfying the
\textit{Dulong-Petit} law. Lastly, we also note that the electric field does
not influence the properties in any way.

generative models, which excel in mimicking human writing style recently.
Latest proposed detectors usually take coarse text sequence as input and output
some good results by fine-tune pretrained models with standard cross-entropy
loss. However, these methods fail to consider the linguistic aspect of text
(e.g., coherence) and sentence-level structures. Moreover, they lack the
ability to handle the low-resource problem which could often happen in practice
considering the enormous amount of textual data online. In this paper, we
present a coherence-based contrastive learning model named CoCo to detect the
possible MGT under low-resource scenario. Inspired by the distinctiveness and
permanence properties of linguistic feature, we represent text as a coherence
graph to capture its entity consistency, which is further encoded by the
pretrained model and graph neural network. To tackle the challenges of data
limitations, we employ a contrastive learning framework and propose an improved
contrastive loss for making full use of hard negative samples in training

theories. If the spatial dimension is infinite, then momentum eigenstates are
not normalizable. This leads to infrared divergences, which are generally
regularized via wave packets or by compactification. However, in some
applications both possibilities are undesirable. In the present note, we
introduce a finite inner product on translation-invariant kink states that
allows us to compute probabilities involving these nonnormalizable states.
Essentially, it is the quotient of the usual inner product by the translation
group. We present a surprisingly simple formula for the reduced inner product,
which requires no knowledge of the zero-mode dependence of the states but
includes a correction which accounts for the mixing between zero modes and
normal modes as the kink moves. As an application, we show that initial and
final state corrections to meson multiplication vanish. However, we find that
the pole of the subleading term in the initial state requires an infinitesimal
imaginary shift.

  Cognitive-Affective State Recognition for Proactive Human-Robot Tutoring",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Using robots in educational contexts has already shown to be beneficial for a
student's learning and social behaviour. For levitating them to the next level
of providing more effective and human-like tutoring, the ability to adapt to
the user and to express proactivity is fundamental. By acting proactively,
intelligent robotic tutors anticipate possible situations where problems for
the student may arise and act in advance for preventing negative outcomes.
Still, the decisions of when and how to behave proactively are open questions.
Therefore, this paper deals with the investigation of how the student's
cognitive-affective states can be used by a robotic tutor for triggering
proactive tutoring dialogue. In doing so, it is aimed to improve the learning
experience. For this reason, a concept learning task scenario was observed
where a robotic assistant proactively helped when negative user states were
detected. In a learning task, the user's states of frustration and confusion
were deemed to have negative effects on the outcome of the task and were used
to trigger proactive behaviour. In an empirical user study with 40
undergraduate and doctoral students, we studied whether the initiation of
proactive behaviour after the detection of signs of confusion and frustration
improves the student's concentration and trust in the agent. Additionally, we
investigated which level of proactive dialogue is useful for promoting the
student's concentration and trust. The results show that high proactive
behaviour harms trust, especially when triggered during negative
cognitive-affective states but contributes to keeping the student focused on
the task when triggered in these states. Based on our study results, we further
discuss future steps for improving the proactive assistance of robotic tutoring
systems.

many countries and is taking an industrial production approach. Despite
abundant literature on factors that affect larvae growth and the optimal static
parameters identified in laboratory setup, for an industrial production process
it is necessary to identify the trajectories such that the growth as well as
the production process is optimal. To achieve this in this work, some of the
important requirements and challenges involved thereof are identified and
objectives of the automation process are formulated within a model based
optimal control setup. Mechanistic models necessary for the optimization
framework are derived as differential equations that describe the dynamic
variation of resources (feed, water, O2 etc.), energy, and larval biomass. In
addition, the elevated metabolic activity of larvae corresponding to the final
instar development is identified and also modelled based on the observation
from experiments. The mass and energy balance approach used in modelling
enables the quantification and distinction of the mass and energy flux
components in various levels (e.g. larvae body, growing medium, production
environment, and external environment) while holding its applicability for both
open and closed/reactor based production setups. Finally, the trajectories
generated using the synthesized optimal controller are tested under different
scenarios showcasing significant reduction in resource consumption compared to
a fixed set-point operation of the production setup. Results presented in this
work not only showcase the potential of the mechanistic models and their
application in identifying the relevant process parameters (e.g. reactor
properties such as volume, thermal conductivity, actuator capacities), but most
importantly in optimizing the process dynamically and tuning the process
objectives as desired.

extremal multivariate total positivity of order 2 ($ \text{EMTP}_2 $). While $
\text{EMTP}_2 $ has nice theoretical properties, it is by construction a global
property and therefore not suitable for applications with only local positive
dependence. We introduce extremal association as a weaker form of extremal
positive dependence and show that it generalizes extremal tree models. This
follows from a sufficient condition for extremal association, which for
H\""usler--Reiss distributions permits a parametric description that we call the

Euclidean distance matrix, the metric property relates to research in electric
network theory and Euclidean geometry. We show that the metric property can be
localized with respect to a graph and study surrogate likelihood inference.

building generative models of eye movements is notoriously difficult, and to
date the computational objectives guiding eye movements remain largely a
mystery. In this work, we tackled these problems in the context of a canonical
spatial planning task, maze-solving. We collected eye movement data from human
subjects and built deep generative models of eye movements using a novel
differentiable architecture for gaze fixations and gaze shifts. We found that
human eye movements are best predicted by a model that is optimized not to
perform the task as efficiently as possible but instead to run an internal
simulation of an object traversing the maze. This not only provides a
generative model of eye movements in this task but also suggests a
computational theory for how humans solve the task, namely that humans use
mental simulation.

Subsequently, the pretrained model is finetuned on a downstream task leading to
an overall better performance while requiring fewer labels. Our method

diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa can cause photoreceptor

important for early detection of eye diseases. Aim: This study is to
demonstrate the feasibility of using intrinsic optical signal (IOS)
optoretinography (ORG) for objective detection of dark adaptation (DA)
abnormality due to rod photoreceptor degeneration. Approach: Functional optical
coherence tomography (OCT) was employed for IOS ORG of wild-type (WT) and
retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mice. Six WT C57BL/6J and eight rd10
B6.CXB1-Pde6brd10/J mice at postnatal day 14 (P14) were used for this study.
Dynamic OCT analysis of retinal thickness and brightness changes, corresponding
to light to dark transition, was implemented Results: Comparative measurement
of the retina under light and dark conditions revealed significant IOS changes
within the outer retina. The thickness between external limiting membrane (ELM)
and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) reduced, and the OCT brightness of inner
segment ellipsoid zone (EZ) decreased during DA, compared to light adaptation
(LA). Relative EZ intensity change was observed to decrease larger in rd10,
compared to WT. The relative intensity of the hyporeflective band between ELM
and RPE also showed significant decrease in rd10 retinas during DA.
Conclusions: DA-IOS abnormalities were observed in rd10, compared to WT at P14.
The ORG measurement of DA-IOS kinetics promises valuable information for

known that ICL is very sensitive to the choice of training examples: randomly
sampling examples from a training set leads to high variance in performance. In
this paper, we show that carefully curating a subset of training data greatly
stabilizes ICL performance without any other changes to the ICL algorithm

training subsets -- both score training examples individually, then select the
highest-scoring ones. CondAcc scores a training example by its average dev-set
ICL accuracy when combined with random training examples, while Datamodels
learns linear regressors that estimate how the presence of each training
example influences LLM outputs. Across five tasks and two LLMs, sampling from
stable subsets selected by CondAcc and Datamodels improves average accuracy
over sampling from the entire training set by 7.7% and 6.3%, respectively.
Surprisingly, the stable subset examples are not especially diverse in content

perplexity are important when prompting LLMs.

reduction) a clear decomposition of the secular Hamiltonian as
$H_{sec}=H_{planar} +H_{space}$, where $H_{space}$ contains all terms depending
on $i_{mut}$. We numerically compare several models obtained via expansion in
the orbital eccentricities or via multipole expansion. We find the mimimum
required truncation orders to accurately represent the dynamics. We explore the
transition, as $i_{mut}$ increases, from a `planar-like' to a `Lidov-Kozai'
regime. Using a typical (non-hierarchical) example, we show how the structure
of the phase portraits of the integrable secular dynamics of the planar case is
reproduced to a large extent also in the 3D case. We estimate semi-analytically
the level of $i_{mut}$ up to which the dynamics remains nearly-integrable. In
this regime, we propose a normal form method by which the basic periodic orbits
of the nearly-integrable regime (apsidal corotation resonances) can be computed
semi-analytically. On the other hand, as the energy increases the system
gradually moves to the `Lidov-Kozai' regime. The latter is dominated by two
different families of inclined periodic orbits ($C_1$ and $C_2$), of which
$C_2$ becomes unstable via the usual Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We discuss the
connection between the above families of periodic orbits. Finally, we study

hybrid nanostructured anode based on silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) anchored on
vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) with defined spacing to
accommodate volumetric changes is synthesized on commercial macroscopic current
collector. Achieving electrodes with good stability and excellent
electrochemical properties remain a challenge. Therefore, we herein tune the
active silicon areal loading either through the modulation of the SiNPs volume
by changing the silicon deposition time at a fixed VACNTs carpet length or
through the variation of the VACNT length at a fixed SiNPs volume. The low
areal loading of SiNPs improves capacity stability during cycling but triggers
large irreversible capacity losses due to the formation of the solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. By contrast, higher areal loading electrode
reduces the quantity of the SEI formed, but negatively impacts the capacity
stability of the electrode during the subsequent cycles. A higher gravimetric
capacity and higher areal loading mass of silicon is achieved via an increase
of VACNTs carpet length without compromising cycling stability. This hybrid
nanostructured electrode shows an excellent stability with reversible capacity
of 1330 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles.

These single-metric models provide limited performance when facing

Radar (SAR) images is vital for marine environmental protection. In this paper,
we develop an effective segmentation framework named DGNet, which performs oil
spill segmentation by incorporating the intrinsic distribution of backscatter
values in SAR images. Specifically, our proposed segmentation network is
constructed with two deep neural modules running in an interactive manner,
where one is the inference module to achieve latent feature variable inference
from SAR images, and the other is the generative module to produce oil spill
segmentation maps by drawing the latent feature variables as inputs. Thus, to
yield accurate segmentation, we take into account the intrinsic distribution of
backscatter values in SAR images and embed it in our segmentation model. The
intrinsic distribution originates from SAR imagery, describing the physical
characteristics of oil spills. In the training process, the formulated
intrinsic distribution guides efficient learning of optimal latent feature
variable inference for oil spill segmentation. The efficient learning enables
the training of our proposed DGNet with a small amount of image data. This is
economically beneficial to oil spill segmentation where the availability of oil
spill SAR image data is limited in practice. Additionally, benefiting from
optimal latent feature variable inference, our proposed DGNet performs accurate
oil spill segmentation. We evaluate the segmentation performance of our
proposed DGNet with different metrics, and experimental evaluations demonstrate
its effective segmentations.

at the well location (from well logging); (ii) absolute integral permeability
of the domain around the well and (iii) skin factor (from well tests). Inverse

genomic research of protein-protein interaction networks, to the physiological
study of biologically optimized tree-like vascular networks. It is certain that
different biological networks have different optimization criteria and we are
interested in those networks optimized for fluid transport within the
circulatory system. Many theories currently exist. For instance, distributive
vascular geometry data is typically consistent with a theoretical model that
requires simultaneous minimization of both the power loss of laminar flow and a
cost function proportional to the total volume of material needed to maintain
the system (Murray's law). However, how this optimized system breaks down (or
is altered) due to disease has yet to be characterized in detail in terms of
branching geometry and geometric interrelationships. This is important for
understanding how vasculature remodels under changes of functional demands. For
instance, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), drastic cyst development may lead
to a significant alteration of the vascular geometry (or vascular changes may
be a preceding event). Understanding these changes could lead to a better
understanding of early disease as well as development and characterization of
treatment interventions. We have developed an optimal transport network model
which simulates distributive vascular systems in health as well as disease in
order to better understand changes that may occur due to PKD. We found that
reduced perfusion territories, dilated distributive vasculature, and vessel
rarefaction are all consequences of cyst development derived from this
theoretical model and are a direct result of the increased heterogeneity of
local renal tissue perfusion demands.
