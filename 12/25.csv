Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that are responsible for the
transportation, mixing and accumulation of the material particles in the flow.
By calculating the mixing strength we show that the regions revealed by these

can detail the dynamics of surgical smoke informing better design of effective

Consistency or Triplet Clustering), originally motivated in computational
biology and relational databases (Aho, Sagiv, Szymanski, and Ullman, 1981):
given $n$ points, we want to embed them onto the $n$ leaves of a rooted binary
tree (a hierarchical clustering or ultrametric embedding) such that a given set
of $m$ triplet constraints is satisfied. Triplet $ij|k$ indicates that ``$i, j$
are more closely related to each other than to $k$'' and a tree satisfies
$ij|k$ if $d(i,j)$ is the smallest among the 3 distances. Aho et al. (1981)
gave an elegant efficient algorithm to find a tree respecting all constraints
(if it exists) and it is easy to see that a random binary tree is a
1/3-approximation. Unfortunately, despite more than four decades of research,
no better approximation is known.
  Our main theorem--which captures Triplet Reconstruction as a special case--is
a general hardness of approximation result about Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (CSPs) over infinite domains (the variables are mapped to any of the
$n$ leaves of a tree). Specifically, we prove, under Unique Games (Khot, 2002),
that Triplet Reconstruction and more generally, every CSP over hierarchies is
approximation resistant (there is no polynomial-time algorithm that does
asymptotically better than a biased random assignment). This settles the
approximability for many interesting Subtree or Supertree Aggregation Problems.
More broadly, our result significantly extends the list of approximation
resistant predicates and is a generalization of Guruswami, Hastad, Manokaran,
Raghavendra, and Charikar (2011), who showed that ordering CSPs are
approximation resistant. The main challenge in our analyses stems from the fact
that trees have topology which is what determines whether a given triplet
constraint on the leaves is satisfied or not.

To this end, we propose a new simulation-based criterion that considers

recorded by the sensor is most accurate when the agent can perfectly simulate

continuous reinforcement learning task, where the agent is the next flow value
predictor, the action is the next time-series flow value in the sensor, and the
environment state is a dynamically fused representation of the sensor and
transportation network. Actions taken by the agent change the environment,
which in turn forces the agent's mode to update, while the agent further
explores changes in the dynamic traffic network, which helps the agent predict
its next visit more accurately. Therefore, we develop a strategy in which
sensors and traffic networks update each other and incorporate temporal context
to quantify state representations evolving over time.

media. However, light beam propagation in nonlinear media permits to break this
paradigm, and makes it possible to observe photon-photon interactions. Based on
this principle, a beam of light propagating in a nonlinear multimode optical
system can be described as a gas of interacting particles. As a consequence,
the spatio-temporal evolution of this photon gas is expressed in terms of
macroscopic thermodynamic variables, e.g., temperature and chemical potential.
Moreover, the gas evolution is subject to experiencing typical thermodynamic
phenomena, such as thermalization. The meaning of thermodynamic variables
associated with the photon gas must not be confused with their classical
counterparts, e.g., the gas temperature cannot be measured by means of standard
thermometers. Although the thermodynamic parameters of a multimode photon gas
result from a rigorous mathematical derivation, their physical meaning is still
unclear. In this work, we report on optical calorimetric measurements, which
exploit nonlinear beam propagation in multimode optical fibers. Our results
show that, indeed, heat only flows from a hot to a cold photon gas subsystem.
This provides an unequivocal demonstration that nonlinear multimode wave
propagation phenomena are governed by the second law of thermodynamics. In
addition to be fundamental, our findings provide a new approach to
light-by-light activated management of laser beams.

Cryptographic techniques are deployed to construct identity proofs across the

provided by the individuals and issues a zero-knowledge-based id without
revealing any information to the authenticator or verifier. The zkFaith
leverages an aggregated version of the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature

the commitments based on the modification of the personal data; hence update
the issued zkFaith id with no requirement of initiating the protocol from

to perform well on high-dimensional decision making and robotic control tasks.
However, because they solely optimize for rewards, the agent tends to search
the same space redundantly. This problem reduces the speed of learning and
achieved reward. In this work, we present an Off-Policy HRL algorithm that
maximizes entropy for efficient exploration. The algorithm learns a temporally
abstracted low-level policy and is able to explore broadly through the addition
of entropy to the high-level. The novelty of this work is the theoretical
motivation of adding entropy to the RL objective in the HRL setting. We
empirically show that the entropy can be added to both levels if the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between consecutive updates of the low-level
policy is sufficiently small. We performed an ablative study to analyze the
effects of entropy on hierarchy, in which adding entropy to high-level emerged
as the most desirable configuration. Furthermore, a higher temperature in the
low-level leads to Q-value overestimation and increases the stochasticity of
the environment that the high-level operates on, making learning more
challenging. Our method, SHIRO, surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a

eigenvalues of the electronic Hamiltonian -- an unbounded, self-adjoint
operator acting on a Hilbert space of antisymmetric functions. Coupled cluster
(CC) methods, which are based on a non-linear parameterisation of the
sought-after eigenfunction and result in non-linear systems of equations, are
the method of choice for high accuracy quantum chemical simulations but their
numerical analysis is underdeveloped. The existing numerical analysis relies on
a local, strong monotonicity property of the CC function that is valid only in
a perturbative regime, i.e., when the sought-after ground state CC solution is
sufficiently close to zero. In this article, we introduce a new well-posedness
analysis for the single reference coupled cluster method based on the
invertibility of the CC derivative. Under the minimal assumption that the
sought-after eigenfunction is intermediately normalisable and the associated
eigenvalue is isolated and non-degenerate, we prove that the continuous
(infinite-dimensional) CC equations are always locally well-posed. Under the
same minimal assumptions and provided that the discretisation is fine enough,
we prove that the discrete Full-CC equations are locally well-posed, and we
derive residual-based error estimates with guaranteed positive constants.
Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the constants that appear in
our estimates are a significant improvement over those obtained from the local
monotonicity approach.

range, the current generation of 8-10m facilities is likely to remain
competitive at ground-UV wavelengths for the foreseeable future. The Cassegrain
U-Band Efficient Spectrograph (CUBES) has been designed to provide
high-efficiency (>40%) observations in the near UV (305-400 nm requirement,
300-420 nm goal) at a spectral resolving power of R>20,000, although a
lower-resolution, sky-limited mode of R ~ 7,000 is also planned.
  CUBES will offer new possibilities in many fields of astrophysics, providing
access to key lines of stellar spectra: a tremendous diversity of iron-peak and
heavy elements, lighter elements (in particular Beryllium) and light-element
molecules (CO, CN, OH), as well as Balmer lines and the Balmer jump
(particularly important for young stellar objects). The UV range is also
critical in extragalactic studies: the circumgalactic medium of distant
galaxies, the contribution of different types of sources to the cosmic UV
background, the measurement of H2 and primordial Deuterium in a regime of
relatively transparent intergalactic medium, and follow-up of explosive
transients.
  The CUBES project completed a Phase A conceptual design in June 2021 and has
now entered the Phase B dedicated to detailed design and construction. First
science operations are planned for 2028. In this paper, we briefly describe the
CUBES project development and goals, the main science cases, the instrument

information retrieval studies in quantum information theory, we prove that the
notions of 'energy' and 'entropy' can be consistently introduced in human
language and, more generally, in human culture. More explicitly, if energy is
attributed to words according to their frequency of appearance in a text, then
the ensuing energy levels are distributed non-classically, namely, they obey
Bose-Einstein, rather than Maxwell-Boltzmann, statistics, as a consequence of
the genuinely 'quantum indistinguishability' of the words that appear in the
text. Secondly, the 'quantum entanglement' due to the way meaning is carried by
a text reduces the (von Neumann) entropy of the words that appear in the text,
a behaviour which cannot be explained within classical (thermodynamic or
information) entropy. We claim here that this 'quantum-type behaviour is valid
in general in human language', namely, any text is conceptually more concrete
than the words composing it, which entails that the entropy of the overall text
decreases. In addition, we provide examples taken from cognition, where
quantization of energy appears in categorical perception, and from culture,
where entities collaborate, thus 'entangle', to decrease overall entropy. We
use these findings to propose the development of a new 'non-classical
thermodynamic theory' for human cognition, which also covers broad parts of
human culture and its artefacts and bridges concepts with quantum physics
entities.

number of children deported from the US. For a one-point reduction in the
number of children deported from the US to Guatemalan municipalities, there was
an increase of nearly 14 in the number of crossings made by adult males leaving
from Guatemala for Mexico; and nearly 0.5 additional crossings made by male

travelling with their children was also driven by the acute economic shock that
Guatemala experienced during the pandemic. During this period, air pollution in
the analysed Guatemalan municipalities fell by 4%, night light per capita fell
by 15%, and homicide rates fell by 40%. Unlike in previous years, emigrants are
fleeing poverty rather than violence. Our findings suggest that a reduction in

datasets, we find consistent fairness issues resulting in substantial
performance disparities between female- and male-related data.
  Discussion. Our study highlights the issue of biases in chemical NER models.
For example, we find that many systems cannot detect contraceptives (e.g.,
birth control).
  Conclusion. Chemical NER models are biased and can be harmful to
female-related groups. Therefore, practitioners should carefully consider the
potential biases of these models and take steps to mitigate them.

  of Health",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Objective. The impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on patients'
healthcare quality and the disparity is well-known. Many SDoH items are not
coded in structured forms in electronic health records. These items are often
captured in free-text clinical notes, but there are limited methods for
automatically extracting them. We explore a multi-stage pipeline involving
named entity recognition (NER), relation classification (RC), and text
classification methods to extract SDoH information from clinical notes
automatically.
  Materials and Methods. The study uses the N2C2 Shared Task data, which was
collected from two sources of clinical notes: MIMIC-III and University of
Washington Harborview Medical Centers. It contains 4480 social history sections
with full annotation for twelve SDoHs. In order to handle the issue of
overlapping entities, we developed a novel marker-based NER model. We used it
in a multi-stage pipeline to extract SDoH information from clinical notes.
  Results. Our marker-based system outperformed the state-of-the-art span-based
models at handling overlapping entities based on the overall Micro-F1 score
performance. It also achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to the
shared task methods.
  Conclusion. The major finding of this study is that the multi-stage pipeline
effectively extracts SDoH information from clinical notes. This approach can
potentially improve the understanding and tracking of SDoHs in clinical
settings. However, error propagation may be an issue, and further research is
needed to improve the extraction of entities with complex semantic meanings and
low-resource entities using external knowledge.

older adults and is frequently accompanied by cognitive impairment (CI).
Studies have shown that LLD may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the heterogeneity of presentation of geriatric depression suggests
that multiple biological mechanisms may underlie it. Current biological
research on LLD progression incorporates machine learning that combines
neuroimaging data with clinical observations. There are few studies on incident
cognitive diagnostic outcomes in LLD based on structural MRI (sMRI). In this
paper, we describe the development of a hybrid representation learning (HRL)
framework for predicting cognitive diagnosis over 5 years based on T1-weighted
sMRI data. Specifically, we first extract prediction-oriented MRI features via
a deep neural network, and then integrate them with handcrafted MRI features
via a Transformer encoder for cognitive diagnosis prediction. Two tasks are
investigated in this work, including (1) identifying cognitively normal
subjects with LLD and never-depressed older healthy subjects, and (2)
identifying LLD subjects who developed CI (or even AD) and those who stayed
cognitively normal over five years. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first attempts to study the complex heterogeneous progression of LLD based
on task-oriented and handcrafted MRI features. We validate the proposed HRL on
294 subjects with T1-weighted MRIs from two clinically harmonized studies.
Experimental results suggest that the HRL outperforms several classical machine
learning and state-of-the-art deep learning methods in LLD identification and
prediction tasks.

In this article, we study the effect that turbulent-like density perturbations
of the interstellar medium (ISM) have on the evolution of young SNRs. We focus
on the impact such fluctuations have on the SNRs structure and more precisely
on the resulting distance between blast wave and contact discontinuity. Since
cosmic rays acceleration is necessary to explain this distance, this study
indirectly put into question the cosmic rays acceleration at the blast wave
front. Methods. We performed a set of purely hydrodynamic three-dimensional
simulations without cosmic ray acceleration in a co-expanding frame. We
randomly initialised the density variation of the interstellar medium following
a Kolmogorov power law. The resulting ratios of radii between blast wave,
contact discontinuity and reverse shock are then compared to the astronomical
observations. Results. The addition of density perturbation doesnt
significantly change the average ratio of radii. However, the simulations show
a higher growth of interfacial instabilities in the presence of a turbulent
ISM. The resulting deformation of the contact discontinuity could explain the
proximity between contact discontinuity and blast wave. They also explain the
plateau in the radial distribution of the line of sight velocity associated
with the observations of Tycho. Conclusions. The density perturbation of the
ISM should not be neglected in the simulation of young SNR as they have an
impact comparable to the cosmic rays acceleration on the SNR structure.

solution to improve the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles by
improving coordination and removing the barrier of non-line-of-sight sensing.
Cooperative Vehicle Safety (CVS) applications are tightly dependent on the
reliability of the underneath data system, which can suffer from loss of
information due to the inherent issues of their different components, such as
sensors failures or the poor performance of V2X technologies under dense
communication channel load. Particularly, information loss affects the target
classification module and, subsequently, the safety application performance. To
enable reliable and robust CVS systems that mitigate the effect of information
loss, we proposed a Context-Aware Target Classification (CA-TC) module coupled
with a hybrid learning-based predictive modeling technique for CVS systems. The
CA-TC consists of two modules: A Context-Aware Map (CAM), and a Hybrid Gaussian
Process (HGP) prediction system. Consequently, the vehicle safety applications
use the information from the CA-TC, making them more robust and reliable. The
CAM leverages vehicles path history, road geometry, tracking, and prediction;
and the HGP is utilized to provide accurate vehicles' trajectory predictions to
compensate for data loss (due to communication congestion) or sensor
measurements' inaccuracies. Based on offline real-world data, we learn a finite
bank of driver models that represent the joint dynamics of the vehicle and the
drivers' behavior. We combine offline training and online model updates with
on-the-fly forecasting to account for new possible driver behaviors. Finally,
our framework is validated using simulation and realistic driving scenarios to
confirm its potential in enhancing the robustness and reliability of CVS

existing data-driven methods are either too simplistic or introduce significant
artifacts into the imagery. To overcome these limitations, we propose
meta-learning style transfer (MLST), which learns a stylization by composing
and tuning well-behaved analytic functions. We find that MLST leads to more
complex stylizations without introducing significant image artifacts and
achieves the best overall detector performance on our benchmark datasets.

rules for the energy transfer between nonlinear vibrational modes of different

dynamical equations of the considered system. The collection of modes of a
given bush does not change in time, while there is a continuous energy exchange

with the aid of group-theoretical methods and therefore they can exist for

energy is divided among the available guided modes. Consequently, the initially
localized intensity spreads transversely, the spatial profile undergoes rapid
variations with axial propagation, and the pulse disperses temporally.
Space-time (ST) supermodes are pulsed guided field configurations that
propagate invariantly in multimode waveguides by assigning each mode to a
prescribed wavelength. ST supermodes can be thus viewed as spectrally discrete,
guided-wave counterpart of the recently demonstrated propagation-invariant ST
wave packets in free space. The group velocity of an ST supermode is tunable
independently -- in principle -- of the waveguide structure, group-velocity
dispersion is eliminated or dramatically curtailed, and the time-averaged
intensity profile is axially invariant along the waveguide in absence of
mode-coupling. We establish here a theoretical framework for studying ST
supermodes in planar waveguides. Modal engineering allows sculpting this
axially invariant transverse intensity profile from an on-axis peak or dip
(dark beam), to a multi-peak or flat distribution. Moreover, ST supermodes can
be synthesized using spectrally incoherent light, thus paving the way to
potential applications in optical beam delivery for lighting applications.

idealised internally unstable gap-graded granular soils at varying fines
content and hydraulic loading conditions. The specimens were prepared with a
mixture layer comprising finer and coarser fractions underlying a coarse layer
composed of the coarser fraction alone. This enabled the finer fraction within
the mixture layer to migrate through the coarse layer with upward seepage flow.
The local porosity profile along the specimen was determined using spatial time
domain reflectometry and an inversion algorithm, which enabled the development
of a novel field map of the difference in porosity from the initial condition.
This field map provided a visual guide of the spatial and temporal variation in
porosity and enabled particle migration internally within the specimen to be
quantitatively characterised from onset to progression to washout. The limiting
onset condition identified from the field map was shown to be comparable to
that obtained using conventional approaches, thereby providing strong
validation for the application of porosity-based field maps. As suffusion
progressed, the height of infiltrating finer particles into the coarse layer
increased linearly with time, while the overall rate of particle migration from
the mixture layer to the coarse layer evolved in a non-linear manner with the
rate of migration increasing as the specimen reached a complete mixture

microstructures that manifest high-stress concentrations due to material
discontinuities occurring from hollow regions and thin walls of hollow
particles or microballoons embedded in a continuous medium. Predicting the
mechanical response as non-linear stress-strain curves of such heterogeneous
materials from their microstructure is a challenging problem. This is true
since various parameters, including the distribution and geometric properties
of microballoons, dictate their response to mechanical loading. To that end,
this paper presents a novel Neural Network (NN) framework called
Parameterization-based Neural Network (PBNN), where we relate the composite
microstructure to the non-linear response through this trained NN model. PBNN
represents the stress-strain curve as a parameterized function to reduce the

stress-strain responses and the corresponding parameterized functions using
smaller datasets. This is enabled by extracting high-level features from the
geometry data and tuning the predicted response through an auxiliary term
prediction. Although built in the context of the compressive response
prediction of syntactic foam composites, our NN framework applies to predict
generic non-linear responses for heterogeneous materials with internal
microstructures. Hence, our novel PBNN is anticipated to inspire more

show that detecting and listing cliques (of any size) can be done using
$O(1)$-bandwidth after one round of communication under node insertions and
node/edge deletions. We conclude with an extension of our techniques to obtain
a small bandwidth $1$-round algorithm for listing cliques when more than one

  Gleason Grading of Histopathology Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men worldwide and the second
leading cause of cancer death in the United States. One of the prognostic
features in prostate cancer is the Gleason grading of histopathology images.
The Gleason grade is assigned based on tumor architecture on Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSI) by the pathologists. This process
is time-consuming and has known interobserver variability. In the past few
years, deep learning algorithms have been used to analyze histopathology
images, delivering promising results for grading prostate cancer. However, most
of the algorithms rely on the fully annotated datasets which are expensive to
generate. In this work, we proposed a novel weakly-supervised algorithm to
classify prostate cancer grades. The proposed algorithm consists of three
steps: (1) extracting discriminative areas in a histopathology image by
employing the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithm based on Transformers,
(2) representing the image by constructing a graph using the discriminative
patches, and (3) classifying the image into its Gleason grades by developing a
Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) based on the gated attention
mechanism. We evaluated our algorithm using publicly available datasets,
including TCGAPRAD, PANDA, and Gleason 2019 challenge datasets. We also cross
validated the algorithm on an independent dataset. Results show that the
proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance in the Gleason grading
task in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and cohen-kappa. The code is available at

understood that a component of a permutation is a cycle, an irreducible factor
for a monic polynomial, a connected component for a graph, etc. Combinatorial

the exp-log class with parameter $K=1$ (permutations, derangements, polynomials
over finite field, etc.) and $K=1/2$ (surjective maps, $2$-regular graphs,

$\mathrm{Var}(X_{n})=C(n+O(n^{-\epsilon}))$ for some $\epsilon>0$ and

questions concerning empirical convergence rates remained obscure. This work
closes these gaps for the $(2,2)$-GW distance (namely, with quadratic cost)
over Euclidean spaces of different dimensions $d_x$ and $d_y$. We consider both
the standard GW and the entropic GW (EGW) distances, derive their dual forms,
and use them to analyze expected empirical convergence rates. The resulting
rates are $n^{-2/\max\{d_x,d_y,4\}}$ (up to a log factor when
$\max\{d_x,d_y\}=4$) and $n^{-1/2}$ for the two-sample GW and EGW problems,
respectively, which matches the corresponding rates for standard and entropic
optimal transport distances. We also study stability of EGW in the entropic
regularization parameter and establish approximation and continuity results for
the cost and optimal couplings. Lastly, the duality is leveraged to shed new
light on the open problem of the one-dimensional GW distance between uniform
distributions on $n$ points, illuminating why the identity and anti-identity
permutations may not be optimal. Our results serve as a first step towards a

degradation caused by unexpected failures, is crucial for microservice systems.
The current practice for resilience testing relies on manually defining rules
for different microservice systems. Due to the diverse business logic of
microservices, there are no one-size-fits-all microservice resilience testing
rules. As the quantity and dynamic of microservices and failures largely
increase, manual configuration exhibits its scalability and adaptivity issues.
To overcome the two issues, we empirically compare the impacts of common
failures in the resilient and unresilient deployments of a benchmark
microservice system. Our study demonstrates that the resilient deployment can
block the propagation of degradation from system performance metrics (e.g.,
memory usage) to business metrics (e.g., response latency). In this paper, we
propose AVERT, the first AdaptiVE Resilience Testing framework for microservice
systems. AVERT first injects failures into microservices and collects available
monitoring metrics. Then AVERT ranks all the monitoring metrics according to
their contributions to the overall service degradation caused by the injected
failures. Lastly, AVERT produces a resilience index by how much the degradation
in system performance metrics propagates to the degradation in business
metrics. The higher the degradation propagation, the lower the resilience of
the microservice system. We evaluate AVERT on two open-source benchmark
microservice systems. The experimental results show that AVERT can accurately
and efficiently test the resilience of microservice systems.

fine-tuned problem, the paradox must occur during the inflationary era at the
critical time $t_c=\ln(3\sqrt{\pi}/\sqrt{2}\epsilon_HH_{inf})/2H_{inf}$ (in
Planck units), where $\epsilon_H$ is the first Hubble slow-roll parameter and
$H_{inf}$ is the Hubble rate during inflation. If we instead accept the
fine-tuned problem, then the paradox will occur during the dark energy era at
the critical time
$t_c'=\ln(3\sqrt{\pi}H_{inf}/\sqrt{2}fe^{2N}H_\Lambda^2)/2H_\Lambda$, where
$H_\Lambda$ is the Hubble rate dominated by dark energy, $N$ is the total
number of e-folds of inflation, and $f$ is a purification factor that takes the
range $0<f<3\sqrt{\pi}H_{inf}/\sqrt{2}e^{2N}H_\Lambda^2$.

the jerk, the 3-order derivative of the trajectory, is converted into angular
velocity as a feedforward item, which significantly improves the system
bandwidth. At the same time, feedback and feedforward outputs are combined to
deal with external disturbances and model mismatch. The control algorithm has

systems, and give rise to rich critical behaviors. An outstanding example is
the chiral state transfer, where states can swap under an adiabatic encircling
around the exceptional point, but only along one direction. In dissipative
quantum systems, such exceptional-point encirclings are often accompanied by
decoherence, whose impact is beyond the description of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians. In this work, we study in detail the effects of dephasing on the
encircling dynamics, adopting the full Lindblad master equation. Introducing
experimentally relevant quantum-jump processes that account for dephasing, we
show that gaps emerge in the eigenspectra landscape of the corresponding
Liouvillian superoperator. It follows that the chiral state transfer does not
take place in the adiabatic limit, since the system always adiabatically
follows the quasi-steady state of the Liouvillian regardless of the encircling
direction. Nevertheless, the chirality is restored at intermediate encircling
times, where the dynamics is non-adiabatic in both encircling directions,
distinct from the typical chiral state transfer in non-Hermitian systems. While
our results are applicable to several recent experiments, we examine a recent
cold-atom experiment in particular, and show that the observed long-time
chirality is but limited to the special encircling path therein. Our study
provides further insight into the chiral state transfer under experimental
conditions, and is helpful for controlling open-system dynamics from the
perspective of non-Hermitian physics.

crucial for preventing catastrophic back-reflection and controlling optical
crosstalk in photonic systems. While non-reciprocal devices based on Brillouin
intermodal transitions have been experimentally demonstrated in chip-scale
platforms, harnessing such interactions has required a suspended waveguide
structure, which is challenging to fabricate and is potentially less robust
than a non-suspended structure, thereby limiting the design flexibility. In
this paper, we numerically investigate the performance of a Brillouin-based
isolation scheme in which a dual-pump-driven optoacoustic interaction is used
to excite confined acoustic waves in a traditional ridge waveguide. We find
that acoustic confinement, and therefore the amount of Brillouin-driven mode
conversion, can be enhanced by selecting an appropriate optical mode pair and
waveguide geometry of two arsenic based chalcogenide platforms. Further, we
optimize the isolator design in its entirety, including the input couplers,
mode filters, the Brillouin-active waveguide as well as the device fabrication
tolerances. We predict such a device can achieve 30 dB isolation over a 38 nm
bandwidth when 500 mW pump power is used; in the presence of a +/- 10 nm
fabrication-induced width error, such isolation can be maintained over a 5-10

memoryless channel with i.i.d. state (the Shannon strategy), Markovian states
that include look-ahead (LA) access to the state and energy harvesting. We
characterize the feedback capacity of the general setting as the directed
information between auxiliary random variables with memory to the channel
outputs. We also propose two methods for computing the feedback capacity: (i)
formulating an infinite-horizon average-reward dynamic program; and (ii) a
single-letter lower bound based on auxiliary directed graphs called $Q$-graphs.
We demonstrate our computation methods on several examples. In the first
example, we introduce a channel with LA and derive a closed-form, analytic
lower bound on its feedback capacity. Furthermore, we show that the mentioned
methods achieve the feedback capacity of known unifilar FSCs such as the
trapdoor channel, the Ising channel and the input-constrained erasure channel.
Finally, we analyze the feedback capacity of a channel whose state is
stochastically dependent on the input.

open problem. Whilst behaviour of biological agents is produced through sparse
and irregular spiking patterns, which provide both robust and efficient
control, the activity patterns in most artificial spiking neural networks used
for control are dense and regular -- resulting in potentially less efficient
codes. Additionally, for most existing control solutions network training or
optimization is necessary, even for fully identified systems, complicating
their implementation in on-chip low-power solutions. The neuroscience theory of
Spike Coding Networks (SCNs) offers a fully analytical solution for
implementing dynamical systems in recurrent spiking neural networks -- while
maintaining irregular, sparse, and robust spiking activity -- but it's not
clear how to directly apply it to control problems. Here, we extend SCN theory
by incorporating closed-form optimal estimation and control. The resulting
networks work as a spiking equivalent of a linear-quadratic-Gaussian
controller. We demonstrate robust spiking control of simulated
spring-mass-damper and cart-pole systems, in the face of several perturbations,
including input- and system-noise, system disturbances, and neural silencing.
As our approach does not need learning or optimization, it offers opportunities
for deploying fast and efficient task-specific on-chip spiking controllers with
biologically realistic activity.

private information retrieval with small caches, in which $K$ users are
connected to $S$ non-colluding databases via shared links. Each database
contains a set of $N$ files, and each user has a dedicated cache of size
equivalent to the size of $M$ files. All the users want to retrieve a file
without revealing their demands to the databases. During off-peak hours, all
the users will fill their caches, and when required, users will demand their
desired files by cooperatively generating query sets for each database. After
receiving the transmissions from databases, all the users should get their
desired files using transmitted data and their cache contents. This problem has
been studied in [X. Zhang, K. Wan, H. Sun, M. Ji and G. Caire, \tqt{Fundamental
limits of cache-aided multiuser private information retrieval}, IEEE Trans.
Commun., 2021], in which authors proposed a product design scheme. In this
paper, we propose a scheme that gives a better rate for a particular value of
$M$ than the product design scheme. We consider a slightly different approach
for the placement phase. Instead of a database filling the caches of all users
directly, a database will broadcast cache content for all users on a shared
link, and then the users will decide unitedly which part of the broadcasted
content will be stored in the cache of each user. This variation facilitates
maintaining the privacy constraint at a reduced rate.

existence of a rank-2 self-interacting tensor field called the Kalb-Ramond

wormhole-like solutions. However, detailed analyses of the physical properties
of interest of such solutions are lacking. In this study, we comprehensively
probe the properties of traversable Morris-Thorne like wormhole solutions
sourced by the Kalb-Ramond field strength in both General Relativity (GR) and
$f(R)$ and $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. We also analyze the coupling of the field
strength in GR via a novel non-minimal interaction term in the action. Using
suitable parametric constraints in all cases, we evaluate wormhole shape
functions, numerically analyze the energy conditions near the throat, check the
stability using the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation, and
demonstrate the possibility of minimum exotic matter by estimating the volume
integral quantifier. Our results show the existence of stable wormhole
solutions in GR and a simple $f(R,T)$ gravity model, and unstable ones in a
power-law type $f(R)$ gravity model.

recapitulate two central principles of electromagnetics: (i) like-charged
objects repel, and (ii) they do so regardless of the sign of their electrical
charge. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the solvent plays a hitherto
unforeseen but crucial role in interparticle interactions, and importantly,
that interactions in the fluid phase can break charge-reversal symmetry. We
show that in aqueous solution, negatively charged particles can attract at long
range while positively charged particles repel. In solvents that exhibit an
inversion of the net molecular dipole at an interface, such as alcohols, we
find that the converse can be true: positively charged particles may attract
whereas negatives repel. The observations hold across a wide variety of surface
chemistries: from inorganic silica and polymeric particles to polyelectrolyte-
and polypeptide-coated surfaces in aqueous solution. A theory of interparticle
interactions that invokes solvation at an interface explains the observations.
Our study establishes a specific and unanticipated mechanism by which the
molecular solvent may give rise to a strong and long-ranged force in solution,
with immediate ramifications for a variety of particulate and molecular
processes including tailored self-assembly, gelation and crystallization, as
well as biomolecular condensation, coacervation and phase segregation. These
findings also shed light on the solvent-induced interfacial electrical
potential - an elusive quantity in electrochemistry and interface science

estimation from synthetic data and a few unlabelled real images. Our major
contribution is a novel learning scheme which removes the drawbacks of previous
works, namely the strong dependency on co-modalities or additional refinement.
These have been previously necessary to provide training signals for
convergence. We formulate such a scheme as two sub-optimisation problems on
texture learning and pose learning. We separately learn to predict realistic
texture of objects from real image collections and learn pose estimation from
pixel-perfect synthetic data. Combining these two capabilities allows then to
synthesise photorealistic novel views to supervise the pose estimator with
accurate geometry. To alleviate pose noise and segmentation imperfection
present during the texture learning phase, we propose a surfel-based
adversarial training loss together with texture regularisation from synthetic
data. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the
recent state-of-the-art methods without ground-truth pose annotations and
demonstrates substantial generalisation improvements towards unseen scenes.
Remarkably, our scheme improves the adopted pose estimators substantially even

Competition between this cubic anisotropy and anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole

analyze a quadrupole exchange model that consists of a crystalline-electric
field scheme with the ground-state $\Gamma_3$ non-Kramers doublet and the
excited singlet $\Gamma_1$ state. We find various triple-$q$ orders in the
four-sublattice mean-field approximation. A few partial orders of quadrupoles
are stabilized in a wide range of parameter space at a higher transition
temperature than single-$q$ orders. With lowering the temperature, these
partial orders undergo phase transitions into further symmetry broken phases in
which nonvanishing quadrupole moments emerge at previously disordered sites.
The obtained phases in the mean-field approximation are investigated by a
phenomenological Landau theory, which clearly shows that the cubic invariant

the past few years, there are still some limitations, like the processing time
increasing with accuracy and the lack of comprehensive and challenging datasets
for use and comparison. Recently, it was shown that HR information can be
extracted from facial videos by spatial decomposition and temporal filtering.
Inspired by this, a new framework is introduced in this paper to remotely
estimate the HR under realistic conditions by combining spatial and temporal
filtering and a convolutional neural network. Our proposed approach shows
better performance compared with the benchmark on the MMSE-HR dataset in terms
of both the average HR estimation and short-time HR estimation. High
consistency in short-time HR estimation is observed between our method and the
ground truth.

predefined body parts (such as accessories). Moreover, we propose a novel
implicit position to give a geometric interpretation for each DiP. The implicit
position can also serve as a learning signal to encourage DiPs to be more
position-equivariant with the identity in the image. Lastly, an additional DiP

requires to calculate the distance between intuitionistic fuzzy set and a
reference point which is known to have either maximum (positive ideal solution)

that as the distance of an intuitionistic fuzzy set to the reference point is
decreases, the similarity of intuitionistic fuzzy set with that point
increases. This is a misconception because an intuitionistic fuzzy set which
has the shortest distance to positive ideal solution does not have to be the
furthest from negative ideal solution for all circumstances when the distance
function is nonlinear. This paper gives a mathematical proof of why this
assumption is not valid for any of the non-linear distance functions and
suggests a hypervolume based ranking approach as an alternative to distance
based ranking. In addition, the suggested ranking approach is extended as a new
multicriteria decision making method, HyperVolume based ASsessment (HVAS). HVAS
is applied for multicriteria assessment of Turkey's energy alternatives.
Results are compared with three well known distance based multicriteria

In the real world, many tasks have strict requirements for the quality of deep
learning inference, such as safety-critical and mission-critical tasks. The
fluctuation of inference quality seriously affects its practical applications,
and the quality at the tail may lead to severe consequences. State-of-the-art
and state-of-the-practice with outstanding inference quality designed and
trained under loose constraints still have poor inference quality under
constraints with practical application significance. On the one hand, the
neural network models must be deployed on complex systems with limited
resources. On the other hand, safety-critical and mission-critical tasks need
to meet more metric constraints while ensuring high inference quality.
  We coin a new term, ``tail quality,'' to characterize this essential
requirement and challenge. We also propose a new metric,
``X-Critical-Quality,'' to measure the inference quality under certain
constraints. This article reveals factors contributing to the failure of using

  Preservation",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key feature of federated learning (FL) is to preserve the data privacy of
end users. However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging
gradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the
differential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to
address privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model
performance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and
efficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users.
Specifically, we propose SCFL, a novel Social-aware Clustered Federated
Learning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social
cluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each
cluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model
updates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer
combined results, but not the privacy of individuals. We unfold the design of
SCFL in three steps. \emph{i) Stable social cluster formation. Considering
users' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the
optimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair
revenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. ii) Differentiated
trust-privacy mapping}. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a
customizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize
participants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. iii) Distributed
convergence}. A distributed two-sided matching algorithm is devised to attain
an optimized disjoint partition with Nash-stable convergence. Experiments on
Facebook network and MNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets validate that our SCFL can
effectively enhance learning utility, improve user payoff, and enforce
customizable privacy protection.

network of coaxial cables (graphs), we exploit both experimentally and
theoretically the interplay of nonlinear interactions and wave chaos. We
develop general theories that describe our asymmetric transport (AT)
measurements, its universal bound, and its statistical description via RMT.
These are controlled by the structural asymmetry factor (SAF) characterizing
the structure of the graph. The SAF dictates the asymmetric intensity range
(AIR) where AT is strongly present. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that
expects losses to deteriorate the transmittance, we identify (necessary)
conditions for which the AIR (AT) increases without deteriorating the AT (AIR).

survivability and accuracy in certain and uncertain environments. We
demonstrate that TLA can provide many advantages over existing approaches,

algorithms for training TLA: (a) Closed-loop control, where the fast controller
is trained over a pre-trained slow controller, allowing better exploration for
the fast controller and closed-loop control where the fast controller decides
whether to ""act-or-not"" at each timestep; and (b) Partially open loop control,
where the slow controller is trained over a pre-trained fast controller,
allowing for open loop-control where the slow controller picks a temporally
extended action or defers the next n-actions to the fast controller. We
evaluated our method on a suite of continuous control tasks and demonstrate the
