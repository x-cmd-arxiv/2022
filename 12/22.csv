theory, a mathematical foundation that takes advantage of the structural nature
of mathematical definitions and constructions. It is common in mathematical
practice to consider equivalent objects to be the same, for example, to
identify isomorphic groups. In set theory it is not possible to make this
common practice formal. For example, there are as many distinct trivial groups
in set theory as there are distinct singleton sets. Type theory, on the other
hand, takes a more structural approach to the foundations of mathematics that
accommodates the univalence axiom. This, however, requires us to rethink what
it means for two objects to be equal. This textbook introduces the reader to
Martin-L\""of's dependent type theory, to the central concepts of univalent
mathematics, and shows the reader how to do mathematics from a univalent point
of view. Over 200 exercises are included to train the reader in type theoretic
reasoning. The book is entirely self-contained, and in particular no prior
familiarity with type theory or homotopy theory is assumed.

interests lately. For a special convex problem which has strongly convex
function constraints, we develop a new accelerated primal-dual first-order

$\Ocal(1/{\vep})$ result for the state-of-the-art first-order methods. The key
ingredient to our development is some novel techniques to progressively
estimate the strong convexity of the Lagrangian function, which enables
adaptive step-size selection and faster convergence performance. In addition,
we show that the complexity is further improvable in terms of the dependence on
some problem parameter, via a restart scheme that calls the accelerated method
repeatedly. As an application, we consider sparsity-inducing constrained
optimization which has a separable convex objective and a strongly convex loss
constraint. In addition to achieving fast convergence, we show that the
restarted method can effectively identify the sparsity pattern (active-set) of
the optimal solution in finite steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first active-set identification result for sparsity-inducing constrained
optimization.

drastically from those of the bare impurities. Here, we explore Bose polaron
physics in a two-dimensional nonequilibrium setting by injecting $\sigma^-$
polarised exciton-polariton impurities into a bath of coherent $\sigma^+$
polarised polaritons generated by resonant laser excitation of monolayer
MoSe$_2$ embedded in an optical cavity. By exploiting a biexciton Feshbach
resonance between the impurity and the bath polaritons, we tune the interacting

quasiparticle branches. Using time-resolved pump-probe measurements we observe
how polaron dressing modifies the interaction between impurity polaritons.
Remarkably, we find that the interactions between high-energy polaron

attractive in the strong impurity-bath coupling regime. Our experiments provide
the first direct measurement of Bose polaron-polaron interaction strength in

leverages information about past network behavior to identify a set of robust
paths to be used for multiple future time intervals to avoid the overhead of
updating the forwarding behavior of routers frequently. We compare the results
of our approach to other traffic engineering solutions through extensive
simulations across real network topologies. Our results demonstrate that our

This results in a prioritized list of compartments, i.e., large, uncovered

finding or fashioning inputs that make the compartments available for future

traffic efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Accurately
predicting the trajectories of traffic participants is essential to the
decision-making and motion planning of AVs in interactive scenarios. Recently,
learning-based trajectory predictors have shown state-of-the-art performance in
highway or urban areas. However, most existing learning-based models trained
with fixed datasets may perform poorly in continuously changing scenarios.
Specifically, they may not perform well in learned scenarios after learning the
new one. This phenomenon is called ""catastrophic forgetting"". Few studies
investigate trajectory predictions in continuous scenarios, where catastrophic
forgetting may happen. To handle this problem, first, a novel continual
learning (CL) approach for vehicle trajectory prediction is proposed in this
paper. Then, inspired by brain science, a dynamic memory mechanism is developed
by utilizing the measurement of traffic divergence between scenarios, which
balances the performance and training efficiency of the proposed CL approach.
Finally, datasets collected from different locations are used to design
continual training and testing methods in experiments. Experimental results
show that the proposed approach achieves consistently high prediction accuracy
in continuous scenarios without re-training, which mitigates catastrophic
forgetting compared to non-CL approaches. The implementation of the proposed
approach is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/D-GSM

weakens as we increase the interaction strength beyond a threshold value for
both potential types. We inspect the localized and delocalized states by
perturbing the system via quenching the interaction strength instantaneously to
zero and studying the dynamics of the condensate, which we further corroborate
using the out-of-time-order correlator. The temporal behaviour of the time
correlator displays regular dynamics for the localized state, while it shows
temporal chaos for the delocalized state. We confirm this dynamical behaviour
by analyzing the power spectral density of the time correlator. We further
identify that the condensate admits a quasiperiodic route to chaotic dynamics
for both potentials. Finally, we present the variation of the maximal Lyapunov
exponents for different nonlinearity and disorder strengths that have a
positive value in the regime where the time correlator function shows chaotic

simple protocol. This faster relaxation induced by the reset protocol is
reminiscent of the quantum Mpemba effect. The reset protocol we proposed is

However, radar sensors suffer from low resolution and huge intra-class
variations in the shape of objects. Exploiting the time information (e.g.,
multiple frames) has been shown to help to capture better the dynamics of
objects and, therefore, the variation in the shape of objects. Most temporal
radar object detectors use 3D convolutions to learn spatial and temporal

real-time applications. This work presents RECORD, a new recurrent CNN
architecture for online radar object detection. We propose an end-to-end
trainable architecture mixing convolutions and ConvLSTMs to learn
spatio-temporal dependencies between successive frames. Our model is causal and
requires only the past information encoded in the memory of the ConvLSTMs to
detect objects. Our experiments show such a method's relevance for detecting
objects in different radar representations (range-Doppler, range-angle) and
outperform state-of-the-art models on the ROD2021 and CARRADA datasets while

record-breaking prices have been witnessed. Typically, the assets that NFTs
represent are stored off-chain with a pointer, e.g., multi-hop URLs, due to the
costly on-chain storage. Hence, this paper aims to answer the question: Is the
NFT-to-Asset connection fragile? This paper makes a first step towards this end
by characterizing NFT-to-Asset connections of 12,353 Ethereum NFT Contracts
(6,234,141 NFTs in total) from three perspectives, storage, accessibility and
duplication. In order to overcome challenges of affecting the measurement
accuracy, e.g., IPFS instability and the changing availability of both IPFS and
servers' data, we propose to leverage multiple gateways to enlarge the data
coverage and extend a longer measurement period with non-trivial efforts.
Results of our extensive study show that such connection is very fragile in
practice. The loss, unavailability, or duplication of off-chain assets could
render value of NFTs worthless. For instance, we find that assets of 25.24% of
Ethereum NFT contracts are not accessible, and 21.48% of Ethereum NFT contracts
include duplicated assets. Our work sheds light on the fragility along the
NFT-to-Asset connection, which could help the NFT community to better enhance

function. The values of these two parameters tend to be language-specific,
however, and even appear to navigate translations. The properties of the

turns out to be the least constrained by the necessity to place a consecutive

allowing longer uninterrupted sequences of words. Spanish reveals similar

investigations which suggest that stable quark matter can be made only of up
and down quarks, the mass-radius relation for two flavor pure quark stars is
evaluated and compared with the predictions from perturbative QCD (pQCD) at
NNLO. This comparison explicitly shows that by being imbued with
renormalization group properties, and a variational optimization procedure, the
method allows for an efficient resummation of the perturbative series.
Remarkably, when the renormalization scale is chosen so as to reproduce the
mass of pulsar PSR J0740+6620, $M= 2.08\pm 0.07 M_\odot$, one obtains a
mass-radius curve which also predicts quite accurate values for the masses and
radii of pulsar PSR J0030+0451, and compact object HESS J1731-347. Moreover,
the scale dependence of the EoS (and mass-radius relation) obtained with the
RGOPT is greatly improved when compared to that of pQCD. This seminal
application to the description of quark stars shows that the RGOPT represents a

Analogously, operators of fixed dimension define bundles over the conformal

relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that
contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. To circumvent
this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using
semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation
(SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the
positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull
negative instances based on their learned similarities. We validate empirically
our approach on both image and video representation learning. We show that SCE
performs competitively with the state of the art on the ImageNet linear

constraint is of the form $z_1\land z_2$, where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are literals,
i.e., variables or their negations (In MAX DI-CUT each constraint is of the
form $\bar{x}_1\land x_2$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are variables.) Austrin
separated MAX 2-AND from MAX CUT by showing that $\alpha_{\text{2AND}} <
0.87435$ and conjectured that MAX 2-AND and MAX DI-CUT have the same
approximation ratio. Our new lower bound on MAX DI-CUT refutes this conjecture,
completing the separation of the three problems MAX 2-AND, MAX DI-CUT and MAX
CUT. We also obtain a new lower bound for MAX 2-AND, showing that $0.87414\le
\alpha_{\text{2AND}}\le 0.87435$.
  Our upper bound on MAX DI-CUT is achieved via a simple, analytical proof. The
lower bounds on MAX DI-CUT and MAX 2-AND (the new approximation algorithms) use
experimentally-discovered distributions of rounding functions which are then
verified via computer-assisted proofs.

free-riding in federated learning (FL), and determines the Nash equilibrium
strategies when FL is executed over wireless links. To support spectrum sensing
for NextG communications, FL is used by clients, namely spectrum sensors with
limited training datasets and computation resources, to train a wireless signal
classifier while preserving privacy. In FL, a client may be free-riding, i.e.,
it does not participate in FL model updates, if the computation and
transmission cost for FL participation is high, and receives the global model
(learned by other clients) without incurring a cost. However, the free-riding
behavior may potentially decrease the global accuracy due to lack of
contribution to global model learning. This tradeoff leads to a non-cooperative
game where each client aims to individually maximize its utility as the
difference between the global model accuracy and the cost of FL participation.
The Nash equilibrium strategies are derived for free-riding probabilities such
that no client can unilaterally increase its utility given the strategies of
its opponents remain the same. The free-riding probability increases with the
FL participation cost and the number of clients, and a significant optimality
gap exists in Nash equilibrium with respect to the joint optimization for all
clients. The optimality gap increases with the number of clients and the
maximum gap is evaluated as a function of the cost. These results quantify the
impact of free-riding on the resilience of FL in NextG networks and indicate
operational modes for FL participation.

we present a family of error-detectable two-qubit gates for a variety of
bosonic encodings. From a new geometric framework based on a ""Bloch sphere"" of
bosonic operators, we construct $ZZ_L(\theta)$ and $\text{eSWAP}(\theta)$ gates
for the binomial, 4-legged cat, dual-rail and several other bosonic codes. The
gate Hamiltonian is simple to engineer, requiring only a programmable
beamsplitter between two bosonic qubits and an ancilla dispersively coupled to
one qubit. This Hamiltonian can be realized in circuit QED hardware with
ancilla transmons and microwave cavities. The proposed theoretical framework
was developed for circuit QED but is generalizable to any platform that can
effectively generate this Hamiltonian. Crucially, one can also detect
first-order errors in the ancilla and the bosonic qubits during the gates. We
show that this allows one to reach error-detected gate fidelities at the

average pulse profiles with the apparent core-cone structure and interesting
frequency evolution. I show that they can be interpreted through essential
geometric properties of the inverse Compton scattering. If the scattering
occurs in a dipolar magnetosphere and the mean-free-path is long, a nested cone
structure is expected with the cone size ratio of two-thirds, which is
consistent with observations. Being a discontinuous process, the scattering is
consistent with the discrete altitude structure of emission rings as derived
from aberration-retardation effects. Assuming that the upscattered signal is
the curvature radiation (CR), one can interpret the observed bifurcated
components (BCs) as a magnified microbeam of CR: the BCs are wide low-frequency
CR microbeams that have been upshifted in frequency with their width preserved
by beam-copying scattering in divergent magnetic field. The large flux of BCs
is partly caused by compression of the full emitted spectrum into the narrow
observed bandwidth, which explains why the frequency-resolved BCs have the
frequency-integrated shape. The wide low-frequency microbeams can encompass
large magnetospheric volumes, which considerably abates the requirements of the
energy needed for coherency. The properties of BCs thus suggest that the
observed modulated radio flux is strongly affected by the scattering-driven
blueshift and spectral compression. The relativistic beaming formula (1/\gamma)
is not always applicable, in the sense that it may not be directly applied to
some blueshifted profile features.

(LQG) have had success in resolving the classical singularity with
polymerisation procedures and by imposing the LQG area gap as a minimum area.
The singularity is replaced by a hypersurface of transition from black to white
holes, and a recent example is the Ashtekar, Olmedo and Singh (AOS) model for a
Schwarzschild black hole. More recently, a one-parameter model, with equal
masses for the black and white solutions, was suggested by Alonso-Bardaji,
Brizuela and Vera (ABBV). An interesting feature of their quantisation is that
the angular part of the metric retains its classical form and the horizon area
is therefore the same as in the classical theory. In the present contribution
we solve the dynamical equations derived from the ABBV effective Hamiltonian
and, by applying the AOS minimal area condition, we obtain the scaling of the
polymerisation parameter with the black hole mass. We then show that this
effective model can also describe Planck scale black holes, and that the
curvature and quantum corrections at the horizon are small even at this scale.
By generating the exterior metric through a phase rotation in the dynamical
variables, we also show that, for an asymptotic observer, the Kretschmann
scalar is the same as in the classical Schwarzschild solution, but with a
central mass screened by the quantum fluctuations.

practical in real-time applications due to the connection instability, limited

inference requests into multiple parts (layers or segments), with each part
being executed in a different UAV based on the available resources.
  Furthermore, some applications require the UAVs to traverse certain areas and
capture incidents; thus, planning their paths becomes critical particularly, to
reduce the latency of making the collaborative inference process. Specifically,
planning the UAVs trajectory can reduce the data transmission latency by
communicating with devices in the same proximity while mitigating the

communications to backdoor (Trojan) attacks. Semantic communications aims to
convey a desired meaning while transferring information from a transmitter to
its receiver. An encoder-decoder pair that is represented by two deep neural
networks (DNNs) as part of an autoencoder is trained to reconstruct signals
such as images at the receiver by transmitting latent features of small size
over a limited number of channel uses. In the meantime, another DNN of a
semantic task classifier at the receiver is jointly trained with the
autoencoder to check the meaning conveyed to the receiver. The complex decision
space of the DNNs makes semantic communications susceptible to adversarial
manipulations. In a backdoor (Trojan) attack, the adversary adds triggers to a
small portion of training samples and changes the label to a target label. When
the transfer of images is considered, the triggers can be added to the images
or equivalently to the corresponding transmitted or received signals. In test
time, the adversary activates these triggers by providing poisoned samples as
input to the encoder (or decoder) of semantic communications. The backdoor
attack can effectively change the semantic information transferred for the
poisoned input samples to a target meaning. As the performance of semantic
communications improves with the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of
channel uses, the success of the backdoor attack increases as well. Also,
increasing the Trojan ratio in training data makes the attack more successful.
In the meantime, the effect of this attack on the unpoisoned input samples
remains limited. Overall, this paper shows that the backdoor attack poses a
serious threat to semantic communications and presents novel design guidelines
to preserve the meaning of transferred information in the presence of backdoor
attacks.

researchers focus only on a few facets of AI model-building. Peer review shows
excessive focus on biases in the datasets, fairness metrics, and algorithmic

complicated than it is for conventional images. Class-imbalanced datasets are
another prevalent phenomenon, and models trained on these become biased towards
the majority classes. This becomes a critical issue with an SSL model's subpar
performance. We aim to address the issue of labeling unlabeled data and also
solve the model bias problem due to imbalanced datasets while achieving better
accuracy. To accomplish this, we create ""artificial"" labels and train a model
to have reasonable accuracy. We iteratively redistribute the classes through
resampling using a distribution alignment technique. We use a variety of class
imbalanced satellite image datasets: EuroSAT, UCM, and WHU-RS19. On UCM
balanced dataset, our method outperforms previous methods MSMatch and FixMatch
by 1.21% and 0.6%, respectively. For imbalanced EuroSAT, our method outperforms
MSMatch and FixMatch by 1.08% and 1%, respectively. Our approach significantly
lessens the requirement for labeled data, consistently outperforms alternative
approaches, and resolves the issue of model bias caused by class imbalance in
datasets.

crucial to determine the properties and the underlying physics of the new

example the case of the trilinear coupling of scalar partners of the top quark
to the Higgs boson. We discuss possible strategies for experimentally
determining the scalar top (stop) trilinear coupling parameter, which controls
the stop-stop-Higgs interaction, and we demonstrate the impact of different
renormalisation prescriptions for this parameter. We find that the best
prospects for determining the stop trilinear coupling arise from its quantum
effects entering the model prediction for the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson
in comparison to the measured value. We point out that the prediction for the
Higgs-boson mass has a high sensitivity to the stop trilinear coupling even for
heavy masses of the non-standard particles. Regarding the renormalisation of
the stop trilinear coupling we identify a renormalisation scheme that is
preferred in view of the present level of accuracy and we clarify the source of
potentially large logarithms that cannot be resummed with standard
renormalisation group methods.

of jokes using large language models (LLMs) as AI judges. Our method relies on
inducing different personalities into the LLM and aggregating the votes of the
AI judges into a single score to rate jokes. We validate the votes using an
auditing technique that checks if the explanation for a particular vote is
reasonable using the LLM. We tested our methodology on 52 jokes in a crowd of
four AI voters with different humour types: affiliative, self-enhancing,
aggressive and self-defeating. Our results show that few-shot prompting leads
to better results than zero-shot for the voting question. Personality induction
showed that aggressive and self-defeating voters are significantly more
inclined to find more jokes funny of a set of aggressive/self-defeating jokes
than the affiliative and self-enhancing voters. The Crowd Score follows the
same trend as human judges by assigning higher scores to jokes that are also
considered funnier by human judges. We believe that our methodology could be
applied to other creative domains such as story, poetry, slogans, etc. It could
both help the adoption of a flexible and accurate standard approach to compare
different work in the CC community under a common metric and by minimizing
human participation in assessing creative artefacts, it could accelerate the
prototyping of creative artefacts and reduce the cost of hiring human
participants to rate creative artefacts.

noise-assisted random jumps between bistable states at room temperature and
exhibit high sensitivity to the driving frequency. Through artificially heating
different mechanical vibration modes by external input of white noise, the
switching rate exhibits exponential dependence on the effective temperature and
follows with Kramer's law. Furthermore, both the measured switching rate and
activation energy exhibit sensitivity to the width of the hysteresis window in
nonlinear response and the driving force, which is in qualitative agreement
with the theoretical descriptions. Besides, white noise-induced hysteresis
window squeezing and bifurcation point shifting have also been observed, which
are attributed to the stochastic force modulation of the spring constant of the

the available numbers of cores. This development calls for re-emphasizing

performance. Understanding speedup and efficiency issues of algorithmic
parallelism is useful for several purposes, including the optimization of
system operations, temporal predictions on the execution of a program, and the
analysis of asymptotic properties and the determination of speedup bounds.
However, the literature is fragmented and shows a large diversity and
heterogeneity of speedup models and laws. These phenomena make it challenging
to obtain an overview of the models and their relationships, to identify the
determinants of performance in a given algorithmic and computational context,
and, finally, to determine the applicability of performance models and laws to
a particular parallel computing setting. In this work, we provide a generic
speedup (and thus also efficiency) model for homogeneous computing
environments. Our approach generalizes many prominent models suggested in the
literature and allows showing that they can be considered special cases of a
unifying approach. The genericity of the unifying speedup model is achieved
through parameterization. Considering combinations of parameter ranges, we
identify six different asymptotic speedup cases and eight different asymptotic
efficiency cases. Jointly applying these speedup and efficiency cases, we
derive eleven scalability cases, from which we build a scalability typology.
Researchers can draw upon our typology to classify their speedup model and to
determine the asymptotic behavior when the number of parallel processing units
increases. In addition, our results may be used to address various extensions

cohort study. The model was estimated with a negative binomial distribution for
the activity counts (1-minute epochs) to account for overdispersion relative to
a Poisson process. Furthermore, self-reported measures were dichotomized (for
each one-minute interval) and subject to misclassification. We assumed that the
unobserved sleep-wake cycle follows a two-state Markov chain with transitional
probabilities varying according to a circadian rhythm. Maximum-likelihood
estimation using a backward-forward algorithm was applied to fit the
longitudinal data on a subject by subject basis. The algorithm was used to
reconstruct the sleep-wake cycle from sequences of self-reported sleep and

this approach under different observational patterns including both complete

2HDMs type~I and~II, we analyze several two-dimensional benchmark planes that
are over large parts in agreement with all theoretical and experimental
constraints. For these planes we evaluate di-Higgs production cross sections at
the (HL-)LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at NLO in the heavy
top-quark limit with the code HPAIR. We investige in particular the process $gg
\to hh$, with $h$ being the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC with a mass of
about 125 GeV. The top box diagram of the loop-mediated gluon fusion process
into Higgs pairs interferes with the $s$-channel exchange of the two CP-even
2HDM Higgs bosons $h$ and $H$ involving the trilinear couplings $\lambda_{hhh}$
and $\lambda_{hhH}$, respectively. Depending on the size of the involved
top-Yukawa and triple Higgs couplings as well as on the mass of $H$, the
contribution of the $s$-channel $H$~diagram can be dominating or be highly
suppressed. We find regions of the allowed parameter space in which the
di-Higgs production cross section can differ by many standard deviations from
its SM prediction, indicating possible access to deviations in $\lambda_{hhh}$
from the SM value $\lambda_{\rm SM}$ and/or contributions involving
$\lambda_{hhH}$. The sensitivity to $\lambda_{hhH}$ is further analyzed
employing the $m_{hh}$ distributions. We demonstrate how a possible measurement
of $\lambda_{hhH}$ depends on the various experimenal uncertainties. Depending
on the underlying parameter space, the HL-LHC may have the option not only to
detect beyond-the-Standard-Model triple Higgs couplings, but also to provide a
first rough measurement of their sizes.

2019, a generalization of biadjoint scalar amplitudes based on generalized

(GCO) is defined as a collection of standard color orderings that is induced,
in a precise sense, from an arrangement of projective lines on $\mathbb{RP}^2$.
We present results for $n\leq 9$ generalized color orderings and GFDs,

We first
leverage the count-free variant of the Weisfeiler--Leman Version I algorithm
for groups (Brachter & Schweitzer, LICS 2020) in tandem with limited
non-determinism and limited counting to improve the parallel complexity of
isomorphism testing for several families of groups. In particular, we show the
following:
  - Let $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ be class $2$ $p$-groups of exponent $p$ arising
from the CFI and twisted CFI graphs (Cai, F\""urer, & Immerman, Combinatorica
1992) respectively, via Mekler's construction (J. Symb. Log., 1981). If the
base graph $\Gamma_{0}$ is $3$-regular and connected, then we can distinguish
$G_{1}$ from $G_{2}$ in $\beta_{1}\textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FOLL})$. This
improves the upper bound of $\textsf{TC}^{1}$ from Brachter & Schweitzer
(ibid).
  - Isomorphism testing between an arbitrary group $K$ and a group $G$ with an
Abelian normal Hall subgroup whose complement is an $O(1)$-generated solvable
group with solvability class poly $\log \log n$ is in
$\beta_{1}\textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FO}($poly $\log \log n))$. This notably
includes instances where the complement is an $O(1)$-generated nilpotent group.
This problem was previously known to be in $\textsf{P}$ (Qiao, Sarma, & Tang,
STACS 2011) and $\textsf{L}$ (Grochow & Levet, arXiv 2022).
  - Isomorphism testing between a direct product of simple groups and an
arbitrary group is in $\beta_{1} \textsf{MAC}^{0}(\textsf{FOLL})$. This problem
was previously shown to be in $\textsf{L}$ (Brachter & Schweitzer, ESA 2022).
  We finally show that the $q$-ary count-free pebble game is unable to
distinguish even Abelian groups. This extends the result of Grochow & Levet
(arXiv 2022), who established the result in the case of $q = 1$. The general
theme is that some counting appears necessary to place \textsc{Group
Isomorphism} into $\textsf{P}$.

emission can differentiate a region that will imminently produce a solar flare
from one that will not. Parametrizations based on moment analysis of direct and
running-difference images provide for physically-interpretable results from
nonparametric discriminant analysis. Across four event definitions including
both 24hr and 6hr validity periods, 160 image-based parameters capture the
general state of the atmosphere, rapid brightness changes, and longer-term
intensity evolution. We find top Brier Skill Scores in the 0.07--0.33 range,
True Skill Statistics in the 0.68--0.82 range (both depending on event
definition), and Receiver Operating Characteristic Skill Scores above 0.8.
Total emission can perform notably as can steeply increasing or decreasing
brightness, although mean brightness measures do not, demonstrating the
well-known active-region-size/flare-productivity relation. Once a region is
flare productive, the active-region coronal plasma appears to stay hot. The
94AA filter data provides the most parameters with discriminating power, with
indications that it benefits from sampling multiple physical regimes. In
particular, classification success using higher-order moments of running
difference images indicate a propensity for flare-imminent regions to display
short-lived small-scale brightening events. Parameters describing the evolution
of the corona can provide flare-imminent indicators, but at no preference over
""static"" parameters. Finally, all parameters and NPDA-derived probabilities are

suppress the coffee ring effect often focus on physical effects such as
Marangoni flows. Here we focus on a purely geometric effect - the effect of
substrate curvature - by evaporating suspension droplets on spherical surfaces

gluing. They can formally be described as modular algebras over central
extensions of the modular surface operad, with the values of the algebra lying
in a suitable symmetric monoidal $(2,1)$-category $\mathcal{S}$ of linear
categories. In this paper, we prove that modular functors in $\mathcal{S}$ are
equivalent to self-dual balanced braided algebras $\mathcal{A}$ in
$\mathcal{S}$ (a categorification of the notion of a commutative Frobenius
algebra) for which a condition formulated in terms of factorization homology
with coefficients in $\mathcal{A}$ is satisfied; we call such $\mathcal{A}$

restriction. Our construction of the inverse equivalence is entirely
topological and can be thought of as a far reaching generalization of the
construction of modular functors from skein theory. In order to verify the
connectedness condition in practice, we prove that cofactorizability of
$\mathcal{A}$, a condition known to be satisfied for modular categories, is
sufficient. Therefore, we recover in particular Lyubashenko's construction of a
modular functor from a (not necessarily semisimple) modular category and show
that it is determined by its genus zero part. Additionally, we exhibit modular
functors that do not come from modular categories and outline applications to

recognition of emotional state is mediated by whether the subject is fully or
partially clothed. Embedding association tests (EATs) return significant effect
sizes for both anger (d >0.80) and sadness (d >0.50), associating images of
fully clothed subjects with emotions. GRAD-CAM saliency maps highlight that
CLIP gets distracted from emotional expressions in objectified images. A second
experiment measures the effect in a representative application: an automatic
image captioner (Antarctic Captions) includes words denoting emotion less than
50% as often for images of partially clothed women than for images of fully
clothed women. A third experiment finds that images of female professionals
(scientists, doctors, executives) are likely to be associated with sexual
descriptions relative to images of male professionals. A fourth experiment
shows that a prompt of ""a [age] year old girl"" generates sexualized images (as

2022). In later works, they were shown to be intimately connected to optimally
list-decodable codes and maximally recoverable tensor codes. Therefore
(explicit) constructions of higher order MDS codes over small fields is an
important open problem. Higher order MDS codes are denoted by
$\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ where $\ell$ denotes the order of generality,
$\operatorname{MDS}(2)$ codes are equivalent to the usual MDS codes. The best
prior lower bound on the field size of an $(n,k)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$
codes is $\Omega_\ell(n^{\ell-1})$, whereas the best known (non-explicit) upper
bound is $O_\ell(n^{k(\ell-1)})$ which is exponential in the dimension.
  In this work, we nearly close this exponential gap between upper and lower
bounds. We show that an $(n,k)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(3)$ codes requires a field
of size $\Omega_k(n^{k-1})$, which is close to the known upper bound. Using the
connection between higher order MDS codes and optimally list-decodable codes,
we show that even for a list size of 2, a code which meets the optimal
list-decoding Singleton bound requires exponential field size; this resolves an
open question from Shangguan and Tamo (STOC 2020).
  We also give explicit constructions of $(n,k)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$
code over fields of size $n^{(\ell k)^{O(\ell k)}}$. The smallest non-trivial
case where we still do not have optimal constructions is
$(n,3)$-$\operatorname{MDS}(3)$. In this case, the known lower bound on the
field size is $\Omega(n^2)$ and the best known upper bounds are $O(n^5)$ for a
non-explicit construction and $O(n^{32})$ for an explicit construction. In this
paper, we give an explicit construction over fields of size $O(n^3)$ which
comes very close to being optimal.

them would allow the derivation of strong constraints on key physical
parameters like the magnitude or extent of suppressed diffusion around the

using phase-locked stimulation have been put forth as alternatives to drugs for
improving slow-wave sleep quality. Due to technical limitations, this approach
has not been tested on faster frequency alpha oscillations. Here we examine the
feasibility of using an endpoint-corrected version of the Hilbert Transform
(ecHT) algorithm implemented on-device to measure alpha phase and deliver
phase-locked auditory stimulation to modulate alpha and promote sleep
initiation. First, the ecHT algorithm is implemented on a tabletop
electroencephalogram (EEG) device and used to measure the timing of the
auditory evoked response and its delivery at precise phases of the alpha
oscillation. Secondly, a pilot at-home study tests feasibility to use a
wearable version of the neuromodulation device for real-time phase-locked
stimulation in the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range. Auditory stimulation was
delivered at the intended phases of alpha with high precision, and alpha
oscillations were affected differently by stimuli delivered at opposing phases.
Our wearable system was capable of measuring sleep micro- and macro-events
present in the EEG that were appropriate for clinical sleep scoring. Sleep
onset latencies were reduced for a subset of subjects displaying sleep onset
insomnia symptoms in the stimulation condition. This study demonstrates the

between interactions, an applied magnetic field and crystalline or
quasiperiodic geometries. Rotational motion will be induced on charged
particles when a magnetic field is present, which can result in exotic
distributions of current on a lattice. Typically, the geometry of a ladder
lattice is assumed to be homogeneous. In this work, however, we will also study
ladders that possess non-uniform bond lengths, in order to study the formation
of localised currents. By using Density Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG) to
characterise the quantum phases, we confirm the presence of the usual vortex
and Meissner distributions of current, in which particles circulate within the
bulk and around the edge respectively. Furthermore, it is also possible to
observe variations to these patterns; which combine both vortex and Meissner
order, and the onset of incompressible domains for certain fillings of the
lattice. If the bond lengths of a ladder fluctuate, we find substantial
differences to the structure of currents. This is a consequence of an
inhomogeneous, effective magnetic flux, resulting in preferential localisation
of currents throughout the lattice bulk, towards the smaller bond lengths. We
then find that incompressible domains can significantly grow in size extent
across the parameter space, with currents no longer possessing an extended
structure across the longitudinal direction of the ladder.

magnetic moments $\sim \text{few} \times 10^{-13} \mu_B$, up to one order of
magnitude below current limits. For high-energy neutrinos from distant sources,
for which no robust flux prediction exists, we show how the flavour composition
at Earth can be used as a handle to establish the presence of non-negligible
magnetic moments, potentially down to $\text{few} \times 10^{-17} \mu_B$ if the

the sensitivity strongly depends on the galactic resp. intergalactic magnetic

However, the run-time of this approach scales quadratically with the number of

breakthroughs brought by extreme NN in the +1B parameters scale to other
domains, lifting this constraint could significantly expand the set of quantum

of the quadratic scaling. In our preliminary experiments, we demonstrate VQ-NQS

technique. However, completeness was achieved by imposing additional technical
constraints, such as an upper bound on the Schmidt rank of the observables.
Here, we show that these complications are unnecessary in the quantum bilocal

We prove that the quantum inflation hierarchy is complete for the bilocal
scenario in the commuting observables model of locality. We also give a bilocal
version of an observation by Tsirelson, namely that in finite dimensions, the
commuting observables model and the tensor product model of locality coincide.
These results answer questions recently posed by Renou and Xu. Finally, we
point out that our techniques can be interpreted more generally as giving rise
to an SDP hierarchy that is complete for the problem of optimizing polynomial
functions in the states of operator algebras defined by generators and
relations. The completeness of this polarization hierarchy follows from a

discs, or shorter-lived discs formed following singular gas infall events, as
was likely the case in our own Galactic Center. Stars and compact objects in
such environments are therefore expected to interact with the gaseous disc as
they go through it, and potentially become aligned and fully embedded within
it. The interactions of embedded stars with the gas could give rise to a
plethora of physical processes affecting the stars, including growth through
accretion of gas, migration in the disc, stellar captures, and mergers with
other stars. The impact of such processes strongly depends on the population of
stars that eventually align with the disc and become embedded in it. Here we
make use of analytic tools to analyze the alignment process, accounting for
both geometric drag and gas dynamical friction. We find that up to $\sim$10% of
stars and stellar mass black holes can align with AGN disc in the Galactic
Center. The orbits of aligned stars are typically circularized and are prograde
with respect to the AGN disc. Furthermore, alignment and accretion are
intimately linked, and the capture of stars by an AGN disc can potentially
explain the origin of the young stellar disc in the Galactic Center with a
top-heavy mass function, even without the need for a star-formation event.

Partial Conjunction Hypothesis (PCH) test, which combines information across
$m$ base hypotheses to determine whether some subset is non-null. However,
standard methods for testing a PCH can be highly conservative. In this paper,
we introduce the conditional PCH (cPCH) test, a new framework for testing a
single PCH that directly corrects the conservativeness of standard approaches
by conditioning on certain order statistics of the base p-values. Under
distributional assumptions commonly encountered in PCH testing, the cPCH test
produces a p-value that is nearly uniform. Through simulations, we demonstrate
that the cPCH test uniformly outperforms standard single PCH tests and
maintains Type I error control even under model misspecification, and can in
certain situations also be used to outperform state-of-the-art PCH multiple
testing procedures. Finally, we illustrate an application of the cPCH test on a
replicability analysis of four microarray studies.

Quantum) have raised the importance for quantum algorithms relative to their
conventional counterparts due to its asymptotic advantage. For resource
estimates in several quantum algorithms, arithmetic operations are crucial.
With resources reported as a number of Toffoli gates or T gates with/without
ancilla, several efficient implementations of arithmetic operations, such as
addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, square root, etc., have been
accomplished in binary quantum systems. More recently, it has been shown that
intermediate qutrits may be employed in the ancilla-free frontier zone,
enabling us to function effectively there. In order to achieve efficient
implementation of all the above-mentioned quantum arithmetic operations with
regard to gate count and circuit-depth without T gate and ancilla, we have
included an intermediate qutrit method in this paper. Future research aiming at
reducing costs while taking into account arithmetic operations for computing
tasks might be guided by our resource estimations using intermediate qutrits.
Therefore, the enhancements are examined in relation to the fundamental
arithmetic circuits. The intermediate qutrit approach necessitates access to
higher energy levels, making the design susceptible to errors. We nevertheless
demonstrate that the percentage decrease in the probability of error is
significant due to the fact that we achieve circuit efficiency by reducing
circuit-depth in comparison to qubit-only works.

the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) form. This equation describes
the dynamics of open quantum systems in a manner that forgoes the full secular
approximation and retains the impact of coherences between eigenstates close in
energy. We implement full counting statistics with the Unified quantum master
equation to investigate the statistics of energy currents through open quantum
systems with nearly degenerate levels. We show that, in general, this equation
gives rise to dynamics that satisfy fluctuation symmetry, a sufficient
condition for the Second Law of Thermodynamics at the level of average fluxes.
For systems with nearly degenerate energy levels, such that coherences build
up, the Unified equation is simultaneously thermodynamically consistent and
more accurate than the fully Secular master equation. We exemplify our results
for a ""V"" system facilitating energy transport between two thermal baths at
different temperatures. We compare the statistics of steady-state heat currents
through this system as predicted by the Unified equation to those given by the
Redfield equation, which is less approximate but, in general, not
thermodynamically consistent. We also compare results to the Secular equation,
where coherences are entirely abandoned. We find that maintaining coherences
between nearly degenerate levels is essential for the properly capturing the
current and its cumulants. On the other hand, the relative fluctuations of the
heat current, which embody the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, display
inconsequential dependence on quantum coherences.

the particle physics model may not require new stable degrees of freedom which
leads to more freedom in the model-building side. As an example, we show that a
modulus field which dominates the energy density of the Universe prior to its
decay, may explain both DM and baryon asymmetry in the Universe in the context
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) while the lightest

compared to circumnuclear starbursts in nearby galaxies with an average
depletion time of $\sim$1 Gyr. The star formation and molecular gas are offset
by $\sim1$ kpc indicating that stars have decoupled from the gas. We detected
an arc of high linewidth in ionized gas where electron densities are elevated
by a factor of $\sim$4 suggesting a shock front driven by radio jets or
peculiar motion of the BCG. An analysis of nebular emission line flux ratios
suggests that the gas is predominantly ionized by star formation with a small
contribution from shocks. We also calculated the velocity structure function
(VSF) of the ionized and molecular gases using velocity maps to characterize
turbulent motion in the gas. The ionized gas VSF suggests that the radio jets

using a model that includes lensing, magnification and photometric redshift
error. Fitting on scales $6<r_{\rm p} < 70$ Mpc$/h$, we make a detection of
intrinsic alignments in each sample, at $5\sigma-22\sigma$ (assuming a simple
one parameter model for IAs). Using these red samples, we measure the
IA-luminosity relation. Our results are statistically consistent with previous
results, but offer a significant improvement in constraining power,
particularly at low luminosity. With this improved precision, we see detectable
dependence on colour between broadly defined red samples. It is likely that a
more sophisticated approach than a binary red/blue split, which jointly
considers colour and luminosity dependence in the IA signal, will be needed in
future. We also compare the various signal components at the best fitting point
in parameter space for each sample, and find that magnification and lensing
contribute $\sim2-18\%$ of the total signal. As precision continues to improve,
it will certainly be necessary to account for these effects in future direct IA
measurements. Finally, we make equivalent measurements on a sample of Emission

constraining the IA amplitude (assuming the nonlinear alignment model) to be

charged rotating black holes as a special physically important case. The
spacetimes which admit a principal Killing-Yano tensor possess a number of
remarkable properties. In particular, such spacetimes have two commuting
Killing vectors and a Killing tensor responsible for their hidden symmetries.
We calculate the gravitational and electromagnetic contributions to the axial
anomaly currents in the spacetime of a charged rotating black hole, and
demonstrate that the equation for the chiral anomaly current has special
solutions which respect both explicit and hidden symmetries. Two of these
solutions have the form of currents propagating along two principal null
directions, which are null eigenvectors of the Riemann tensor. These solutions
describe chiral currents for the incoming and outgoing polarization fluxes. It
is demonstrated that these principal chiral currents can be written explicitly
in the form which contains the off-shell metric coefficients and their
derivatives. We discuss conditions where the principle chiral anomaly current
is regular at the horizon and the axes of symmetry. We demonstrate that for
states where the current vanishes at the past horizon and at the past null
infinity, there exist chirality fluxes at both the future horizon and future
infinity. The latter is directly related to the polarization asymmetry of
Hawking radiation for massless spinning particles. We also calculate the
Chern-Simons currents for both gravitational and electromagnetic chiral
anomalies in the black hole spacetime, and discuss the properties of the
chirality fluxes associated with these currents.

develop a Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) model in which the impact of
confounders variable influencing both a policy and an outcome of interest is
addressed, resulting in unbiased policy evaluation. Furthermore, we try to
analyze the effect of traffic density by developing a copula-based joint model
of two main components of pedestrian crossing behavior, pedestrian stress level
and waiting time. The copula approach has been widely used in the literature,
for addressing self-selection problems, which can be classified as a causality
analysis in travel behavior modeling. The results obtained from copula approach
and DML are compared based on the effect of traffic density. In DML model
structure, the standard error term of density parameter is lower than copula
approach and the confidence interval is considerably more reliable. In
addition, despite the similar sign of effect, the copula approach estimates the
effect of traffic density lower than DML, due to the spurious effect of
confounders. In short, the DML model structure can flexibly adjust the impact

Magnetism and spin-orbit coupling, two essential ingredients of the oxide
materials, lead to various topological transport phenomena such as the
anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects, which can be significantly
enhanced by designing an electronic structure with a large Berry curvature. In
that respect, double perovskites with the general formula A$_2$BB'O$_6$ with an
alternating ordered arrangement of two transition metal sites, B(3d) and
B'(4d/5d), present attractive possibilities as they are robustly stable against
oxidation under ambient conditions and versatile. These double perovskites also
offer a high energy scale for magnetism as well as strong spin-orbit coupling
with a high magnetic ordering temperature. Here, using first-principles density

intrinsic anomalous transport for 3d-4d/5d based cubic and tetragonal stable

We present an analysis of a GOES M1.8 flare with excellent
observational coverage in UV, EUV, and X-ray, including observations from the
instruments IRIS, SDO with AIA, Hinode/EIS, Hinode/XRT, and Solar Orbiter with
the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX). Hard X-ray emission is
often observed at the footpoints of flare loops and is occasionally observed in
the corona. In this flare, four nonthermal hard X-ray sources are seen.
  Aim. Our aim is to understand why we can observe four individual nonthermal
sources in this flare and how we can characterize the physical properties of
these four sources.
  Methods. We used the multiwavelength approach to analyze the flare and
characterize the four sources. To do this, we combined imaging at different
wavelengths and spectroscopic fitting in the EUV and X-ray range.
  Results. The flare is eruptive with an associated coronal mass ejection, and
it shows the classical flare picture of a heated flare loop seen in EUV and
X-rays, and two nonthermal hard X-ray footpoints at the loop ends. In addition
to the main flare sources, we observed two outer sources in the UV, EUV, and
nonthermal X-ray range located away from the main flare loop to the east and
west. The two outer sources are clearly correlated in time, and they are only
seen during the first two minutes of the impulsive phase, which lasts a total
of about four minutes.
  Conclusions. Based on the analysis, we determine that the outer sources are
the anchor points of an erupting filament. The hard X-ray emission is
interpreted as flare-accelerated electrons that are injected upward into the
filament and then precipitate along the filament toward the chromosphere,
producing Bremsstrahlung. While sources like this have been speculated to
exist, this is the first report of their detection.

(CTMP) are produced globally from softwood chips for production of carton board
grades. For tailor making CTMP for this purpose, wood chips are impregnated
with aqueous sodium sulphite for sulphonation of the wood lignin. When lignin
is sulphonated, the defibration of wood into pulp becomes more selective,
resulting in enhanced pulp properties. On a microscopic fibre scale, however,
one could strongly assume that the sulphonation of the wood structure is very
uneven due to its macroscale size of wood chips. If this is the case and the
sulphonation could be done significantly more evenly, the CTMP process could be
more efficient and produce pulp even better suited for carton boards.
Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a technique based on X-ray
fluorescence microscopy imaging (uXRF) for quantifying the sulphur distribution
on CTMP wood fibres.
  The feasibility of uXRF imaging for sulphur homogeneity measurements in wood
fibres needs investigation. Clarification of which spatial and spectral
resolution that allows visualization of sulphur impregnation into single wood
fibres is needed. Measurements of single fibre imaging were carried out at the
APS synchrotron facility. With a synchrotron beam using 1 um scanning step,
images of elemental mapping are acquired from CTMP samples diluted with
non-sulphonated pulp under specified conditions. Since the measurements show
significant differ-ences between sulphonated and non-sulphonated fibres, and a
significant peak concentration in the shell of the sulphonated fibres, the
proposed technique is found to be feasible. The required spatial resolution of
the uXRF imaging for an on-site CTMP sulphur homogeneity measurement setup is
about 15 um, and the homogeneity measured along the fibre shells is suggested
to be used as the CTMP sulphonation measurement parameter.

tackled by numerical renormalization group (NRG) theory, where the Kondo and

universally with the Kondo temperature divided by the superconducting gap.
However, experimentally the Kondo temperature is usually extracted from
phenomenological approaches, which gives rise to significant uncertainties and
cannot account for magnetic fields properly. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy at 10mK, we apply a magnetic field to several YSR impurities on a

simulated PGV maps exhibit low-rank structure. We quantitatively compare four
function approximators to find the best-fitting ROMs: radial basis function
(RBF) interpolation, multilayer perceptron neural networks, random forests and
k-nearest neighbors. We find RBFs are the most accurate approximator, resulting
in < 0.1 cm/s average PGV error when applied to an independent testing dataset.
We apply the ROMs to predict PGV maps for 1 million different focal mechanisms,
in which the ROMs identify potentially damaging ground motions that might be
overlooked when using only a few physics-based simulations. We also quantify
correlations between focal mechanism, depth, and accuracy of the predicted PGV.
Overall, the ROM approach demonstrates a new way to obtain physics-informed

randomization and benchmarking protocols, the onset of quantum chaos, and
black-hole physics. Unscrambling this information is possible given perfect
knowledge of the scrambler[arXiv:1710.03363]. We show that one can retrieve the
scrambled information even without any previous knowledge of the scrambler, by
a learning algorithm that allows the building of an efficient decoder.
Remarkably, the decoder is classical in the sense that it can be efficiently
represented on a classical computer as a Clifford operator. It is striking that
a classical decoder can retrieve with fidelity one all the information
scrambled by a random unitary that cannot be efficiently simulated on a
classical computer, as long as there is no full-fledged quantum chaos. This
result shows that one can learn the salient properties of quantum unitaries in
a classical form, and sheds a new light on the meaning of quantum chaos.

gauge field theory defined at the level of equations of motion (i.e. without
specifying Lagrangian) in terms of Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. This
notion extends the BV formulation in terms of jet-bundles on the one hand and
the geometrical approach to PDEs on the other hand. In this work we concentrate
on gauge PDEs equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure and show that
under some regularity conditions this data defines a jet-bundle BV formulation.
More precisely, the BV jet-bundle arises as the symplectic quotient of the
super jet-bundle of the initial gauge PDE. In this sense, presymplectic gauge
PDEs give an invariant geometrical approach to Lagrangian gauge systems, which
is not limited to jet-bundles. Furthermore, the presymplectic gauge PDE
structure naturally descends to space-time submanifolds (in particular,
boundaries, if any) and, in this respect, is quite similar to AKSZ sigma models
which are long known to have this feature. We also introduce a notion of a weak
presymplectic gauge PDE, where the nilpotency of the differential is replaced
by a presymplectic analog of the BV master equation, and show that it still
defines a local BV system. This allows one to encode BV systems in terms of
finite-dimensional graded geometry, much like the AKSZ construction does in the

model was developed. The training dataset was generated based upon a CT
image-based phantom (abdomen region) and multiple beam energies/pathways, using
Monte-Carlo simulation (1 mm spatial resolution, no biological washout). For
the modeling of biological washout, a simplified analytical model was applied
to change raw activity profiles over a period of 5 minutes, incorporating both
physical decay and biological washout. For the study of depth selection (a
challenge linked to multi field/angle irradiation), truncations were applied at
different window lengths (100, 125, 150 mm) to raw activity profiles. Finally,
the performance of a worst-case scenario was examined by combining both factors
(depth selection: 125 mm, biological washout: 5 mins). The accuracy was
quantitatively evaluated in terms of range uncertainty, mean absolute error
(MAE) and mean relative errors (MRE). Our proposed AI framework shows good
immunity to the perturbation associated with two factors. The detection of

some approaches have been adopted to refine representations via auxiliary

learning compositional representations from hand-designed and
context-independent self-supervised losses (multi-view) still adapts relatively
slowly to the real world, which contains many non-IID subspaces requiring rapid
distribution shift in both time and spatial attention patterns at varying
levels of abstraction. In contrast, supervised language model cascades have
shown the flexibility to adapt to many diverse manifolds, and hints of
self-learning needed for autonomous task transfer. However, to date, transfer
methods for language models like few-shot learning and fine-tuning still
require human supervision and transfer learning using self-learning methods has
been underexplored. We propose a self-supervised loss policy called contrastive
distillation which manifests latent variables with high mutual information with
both source and target tasks from weights to tokens. We show how this
outperforms common methods of transfer learning and suggests a useful design
axis of trading off compute for generalizability for online transfer.
Contrastive distillation is improved through sampling from memory and suggests
a simple algorithm for more efficiently sampling negative examples for
contrastive losses than random sampling.

constant pairwise couplings. Here, we consider the more general case with
time-dependent transition rates, with the aim of study the impact of such time
dependence on the critical behavior of the model. The analytical and numerical
results show that the nonequilibrium active-absorbing phase transition can be
suppressed in some cases, with the destruction of the absorbing phase where the
radical agents disappear of the population in the stationary states.

high complexity, namely, it is 2EXPTIME complete. Further, the complexity
shrinks by one exponential when the arity is fixed. We show in this paper how
we can obtain better complexity bounds when considering separately the arity of
the guard atom and that of the additional atoms, called the side signature. Our
results make use of the technique of linearizing Guarded TGDs, introduced in a
paper of Gottlog, Manna, and Pieris. Specifically, we present a variant of the
linearization process, making use of a restricted version of the chase that we
recently introduced. Our results imply that open-world query answering can be
solved in EXPTIME with arbitrary-arity guard relations if we simply bound the
arity of the side signature; and that the complexity drops to NP if we fix the

produce artificial inputs that expose issues of the DL systems by triggering
misbehaviours. Unfortunately, such generated inputs may be invalid, i.e., not

different TIGs and 3 classification tasks. Our results show that 84%

lesion detection. Each imaging technique provides diverse visual information
that allows clinicians to identify and classify cancerous lesions. Computer
vision methods that use both imaging techniques could improve endoscopic
diagnosis. We address the challenge of tissue classification when annotations
are available only in one domain, in our case WLI, and the endoscopic images
correspond to an unpaired dataset, i.e. there is no exact equivalent for every
image in both NBI and WLI domains. Method: We propose a semi-surprised
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method composed of three main
components: a teacher network trained on the labeled WLI data; a
cycle-consistency GAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, and a
multi-input student network. To ensure the quality of the synthetic images
generated by the proposed GAN we perform a detailed quantitative, and
qualitative analysis with the help of specialists. Conclusion: The overall
average classification accuracy, precision, and recall obtained with the

discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data
and map the originally categorical labels to the valence and arousal space.
Leveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing, we propose a set of
novel Transformer-based methods for predicting valence and arousal signals over
the course of written stories. We explore several strategies for fine-tuning a
pretrained ELECTRA model and study the benefits of considering a sentence's
context when inferring its emotionality. Moreover, we experiment with
additional LSTM and Transformer layers. The best configuration achieves a

on the current contextual information and historical feedback data. In modern
applications, such context format can be rich and can often be formulated as a
matrix. Moreover, while existing bandit algorithms mainly focused on
reward-maximization, less attention has been paid to the statistical inference.
To fill in these gaps, in this work we consider a matrix contextual bandit
framework where the true model parameter is a low-rank matrix, and propose a
fully online procedure to simultaneously make sequential decision-making and
conduct statistical inference. The low-rank structure of the model parameter
and the adaptivity nature of the data collection process makes this difficult:
standard low-rank estimators are not fully online and are biased, while
existing inference approaches in bandit algorithms fail to account for the
low-rankness and are also biased. To address these, we introduce a new online
doubly-debiasing inference procedure to simultaneously handle both sources of
bias. In theory, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed online
doubly-debiased estimator and prove the validity of the constructed confidence
interval. Our inference results are built upon a newly developed low-rank
stochastic gradient descent estimator and its non-asymptotic convergence
result, which is also of independent interest.

the most promising paradigms for the collaboration of multiple or many clients
who cannot disclose their local data -- neither the training data set nor the
model parameters. One popular approach to preserving the confidentiality of
local data is homomorphic encryption (HE): the clients send encrypted model
parameters to the server, which aggregates the models into a global model and
broadcasts it to the clients. Evidently, the security of the above HE-based
approach depends on the assumption that the clients are honest and cannot
obtain the encrypted models from others (otherwise the models can be
immediately decrypted because all clients share the same private key); this is
indeed the case since the encrypted models are transmitted through protocols
like Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, it is often overlooked that the
leakage of encrypted models does not necessarily happen on the network channel;
for example, if a semi-honest client colludes with a semi-honest server (the
former having the private key and the latter having the ciphertext), possibly
offline in another session, they can surely recover the model parameters in
question. This paper presents a new protocol for secure aggregation under the
mild, in our opinion more practical, assumption that all parties are
semi-honest. As a starting point, we construct a new security primitive, called
\textit{asymmetric threshold secret sharing} (ATSS), which works with
homomorphic encryption to constitute an aggregation protocol to achieve the
desired security. We demonstrate that the ATSS-based protocol is provably
secure and delivers reasonable performance in practice.

Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding have emerged as a promising candidate
because one can achieve fault-tolerance with a probabilistic supply of GKP
states and Gaussian operations. Furthermore, by generalising to
rectangular-lattice GKP states, a bias can be introduced and exploited through
concatenation with qubit codes that show improved performance under biasing.
However, these codes (such as the XZZX surface code) still require weight-four
stabiliser measurements and have complex decoding requirements to overcome. In
this work, we study the code-capacity behaviour of a rectangular-lattice GKP
encoding concatenated with a repetition code under an isotropic Gaussian
displacement channel. We find a numerical threshold of $\sigma = 0.599$ for the
noise's standard deviation, which outperforms the biased GKP planar surface
code with a trade-off of increased biasing at the GKP level. This is all
achieved with only weight-two stabiliser operators and simple decoding at the
qubit level. Furthermore, with moderate levels of bias (aspect ratio $\leq
2.4$) and nine or fewer data modes, significant reductions in logical error
rates can still be achieved for $\sigma \leq 0.3$, opening the possibility of
using GKP-biased repetition codes as a simple low-level qubit encoding for

investigator specifies the distribution of treatment utilization. We estimate
the effect of initiation of a thiazide diuretic or an angiotensin-converting

the idea of generating an ansatz with a small number of parameters, resulting

expression which is correct to second order with respect to changes in the
molecular orbital basis. Our numerical analysis, including calculations for the
transition metal complex ferrocene (Fe$\rm (C_5H_5)_2$), indicates that
convergence in the self-consistent orbital optimization loop can be reached
without a considerable increase in the number of two-qubit gates in the quantum

implement a routine analogous to CASSCF, a cornerstone of state-of-the-art

  author: Michail Damoulakis",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and
the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated. The striped jet model
is a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust
prediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and
dissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of
the magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where
the jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to
(i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions
for the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central
engine. We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission
predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission
spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative
efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches
to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to
find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine
compared to a black hole one. Lastly, we conclude that the model favors broader
distribution of stripe length-scales which results in a more gradual
dissipation profile in comparison to the case where the jet stripes are
characterized by a single length-scale.

Kopriva","Analysis of an Explicit, High-Order Semi-Lagrangian Nodal Method",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A discrete analysis of the phase and dissipation errors of an explicit,
semi-Lagrangian spectral element method is performed. The semi-Lagrangian
method advects the Lagrange interpolant according the Lagrangian form of the
transport equations and uses a least-square fit to correct the update for
interface constraints of neighbouring elements. By assuming a monomial
representation instead of the Lagrange form, a discrete version of the
algorithm on a single element is derived. The resulting algebraic system lends
itself to both a Modified Equation analysis and an eigenvalue analysis. The
Modified Equation analysis, which Taylor expands the stencil at a single space
location and time instance, shows that the semi-Lagrangian method is consistent
with the PDE form of the transport equation in the limit that the element size
goes to zero. The leading order truncation term of the Modified Equation is of
the order of the degree of the interpolant which is consistent with numerical
tests reported in the literature. The dispersion relations show that the method
is negligibly dispersive, as is common for semi-Lagrangian methods. An
eigenvalue analysis shows that the semi-Lagrangian method with a nodal
Chebyshev interpolant is stable for a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition based
on the minimum collocation node spacing within an element that is greater than
unity.

nearby galaxies from the PHANGS-HST survey. We apply a watershed algorithm to
density maps constructed from point source catalogues Gaussian smoothed to
multiple physical scales from 8 to 64 pc. We develop our method on two galaxies
that span the distance range in the PHANGS-HST sample: NGC 3351 (10 Mpc), NGC
1566 (18 Mpc). We test our algorithm with different parameters such as the
choice of detection band for the point source catalogue (NUV or V), source
density image filtering methods, and absolute magnitude limits. We characterise
the properties of the resulting multi-scale associations, including sizes,
number of tracer stars, number of associations, photometry, as well as ages,
masses, and reddening from Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. Our method
successfully identifies structures that occupy loci in the UBVI colour-colour
diagram consistent with previously published catalogues of clusters and
associations. The median ages of the associations increases from log(age/yr) =
6.6 to log(age/yr) = 6.9 as the spatial scale increases from 8 pc to 64 pc for
both galaxies. We find that the youngest stellar associations, with ages < 3
Myr, indeed closely trace H ii regions in H$\alpha$ imaging, and that older
associations are increasingly anti-correlated with the H$\alpha$ emission.
Owing to our new method, the PHANGS-HST multi-scale associations provide a far
more complete census of recent star formation activity than found with previous
cluster and compact association catalogues. The method presented here will be
applied to the full sample of 38 PHANGS-HST galaxies.

presented to design a non-linear MPC(NMPC) local planner for tractor-trailer

velocity and steering angle are considered to be control variables. The
proposed NMPC local planner is designed to handle jackknife situations,
avoiding multiple static obstacles, and path following in both forward and
backward maneuvering. The challenges mentioned above are converted into a
constrained problem that can be handled simultaneously by the proposed NMPC
local planner. The direct multiple shooting approach is used to convert the
optimal control problem(OCP) into a non-linear programming problem(NLP) that
IPOPT solvers can solve in CasADi. The controller performance is evaluated
through different backup and forward maneuvering scenarios in the Gazebo
simulation environment in real-time. It achieves asymptotic stability in
avoiding static obstacles and accurate tracking performance while respecting
path constraints. Finally, the proposed NMPC local planner is integrated with
an open-source autonomous driving software stack called AutowareAi.

series. In the special case of a scalar function $f: \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point $x_0$, trust region
$[a, b]$, and integer $k \ge 1$, and returns an interval $I$ such that $f(x) -
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac {1} {i!} f^{(i)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^i \in I (x - x_0)^k$ for
all $x \in [a, b]$. As in automatic differentiation, the function $f$ is
provided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known
atomic functions.
  At a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of
commonly-used elementary functions (e.g., $\exp$, $\log$), we derive sharp
polynomial upper and lower bounds on the Taylor remainder series. We then
recursively combine the bounds for the elementary functions using an interval
arithmetic variant of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation. Our algorithm can
make efficient use of machine learning hardware accelerators, and we provide an
open source implementation in JAX.
  We then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, we use our new
machinery to create the first universal majorization-minimization optimization
algorithms: algorithms that iteratively minimize an arbitrary loss using a
majorizer that is derived automatically, rather than by hand. Applied to
machine learning, this leads to architecture-specific optimizers for training
deep networks that converge from any starting point, without hyperparameter
tuning. Our experiments show that for some optimization problems, these
hyperparameter-free optimizers outperform tuned versions of gradient descent,
Adam, and AdaGrad. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be
used for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove
sharper versions of Jensen's inequality.

Generally considered to be outside the measurement band, the Doppler effect
appears to have been largely overlooked in literature on numerical simulations
of time-delay interferometry (TDI). However, the potential impact on the
effectiveness of TDI should be assessed. The issue is particularly relevant to
TianQin that features geocentric orbits, because of strong gravity disturbances

of a slow and power consuming external memory. This paper exploits two schemes
to reduce the required memory amount and ultimately to implement a CNN of
reasonable performance only with on-chip memory of a practical device like a
low-end FPGA. To reduce the memory amount of the intermediate data, a
stream-based line-buffer architecture and a dataflow for the architecture are
proposed instead of the conventional frame-based architecture, where the amount
of the intermediate data memory is proportional to the square of the input
image size. The architecture consists of layer-dedicated blocks operating in a
pipelined way with the input and output streams. Each convolutional layer block
has a line buffer storing just a few rows of input data. The sizes of the line
buffers are proportional to the width of the input image, so the architecture
requires less intermediate data storage than the conventional frame-based
architecture, especially in the trend of getting larger input size in modern
object detection CNNs. In addition to the reduced intermediate data storage,
the weight memory is reduced by the accelerator-aware pruning. The experimental
results show that a whole object detection CNN can be implemented even on a
low-end FPGA without an external memory. Compared to previous accelerators with
similar object detection accuracy, the proposed accelerator reaches much higher
throughput even with less FPGA resources of LUTs, registers, and DSPs, showing
much higher efficiency. The trained models and implemented bit files are

The hypergraph can more profoundly indicate the interactions between
individuals and their environments because each edge in the hypergraph (a.k.a
hyperedge) contains more than two nodes, which is perfect to describe social
environments. A line graph treats each social environment as a super node with
the underlying influence between different environments. In this way, we go
beyond traditional pair-wise relations and explore richer patterns under
various sociological criteria; Second, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
neural network to learn social influence flowing from users to users, users to

neural network can be learned via a task-free method, making our model very
flexible to support various data mining tasks and sociological analysis; Third,

to manipulate others' beliefs by strategically revealing information to other
players. This work considers a double-sided information asymmetry in a Bayesian
Stackelberg game, where the leader's realized action, sampled from the mixed
strategy commitment, is hidden from the follower. In contrast, the follower
holds private information about his payoff. Given asymmetric information on
both sides, an important question arises: \emph{Does the leader's information
advantage outweigh the follower's?} We answer this question affirmatively in
this work, where we demonstrate that by adequately designing a signaling device
that reveals partial information regarding the leader's realized action to the
follower, the leader can achieve a higher expected utility than that without
signaling. Moreover, unlike previous works on the Bayesian Stackelberg game
where mathematical programming tools are utilized, we interpret the leader's
commitment as a probability measure over the belief space. Such a probabilistic
language greatly simplifies the analysis and allows an indirect signaling
scheme, leading to a geometric characterization of the equilibrium under the
proposed game model.

Nmap, Nessus, Sparta and Metasploit, etc. Typically, much effort was employed
on reconnaissance & scanning phases, rather than system exploration, due to
their importance in identifying security vulnerabilities in the system

human errors. However, comprising the system is not sufficient because the
critical data (Flag) generally requires the administrators rights.
Consequently, teams often examine the system to find a way to escalate

Mitigation strategies addressing the identified vulnerabilities are recommended

distressed postpartum support seekers on two digital platforms, a one-on-one
digital helpline and a publicly available online forum. Using a combination of
human annotations, dictionary models and unsupervised techniques, we find stark

Distressed mothers described interpersonal problems and a lack of support, with
8.60% - 14.56% reporting severe symptoms including suicidal ideation. In
contrast, the majority of healthy mothers described childcare issues, such as
questions about breastfeeding or sleeping, and reported no severe mental health
concerns. Across the two digital platforms, we found that distressed mothers
shared similar content. However, the patterns of speech and affect shared by

on static, design-time partitioning of their programs which cannot keep pace
with storage systems that are layering compute units throughout deepening
hierarchies of storage devices.
  We argue that dynamic, just-in-time partitioning of computation offers a
solution for emerging data-intensive systems to overcome ever-growing data
sizes in the face of stalled CPU performance and memory bandwidth. In this
paper, we describe our prototype computational storage system (CSS), Skytether,
that adopts a database perspective to utilize computational storage drives
(CSDs). We also present MSG Express, a data management system for single-cell

principles that guide the design of our CSS: support scientific applications;
maximize utilization of storage, network, and memory bandwidth; minimize data
movement; and enable flexible program execution on autonomous CSDs. Skytether
is designed for the extra layer of indirection that CSDs introduce to a storage
system, using decomposable queries to take a new approach to computational
storage that has been imagined but not yet explored.
  In this paper, we evaluate: partition strategies, the overhead of function
execution, and the performance of selection and projection. We expected ~3-4x
performance slowdown on the CSDs compared to a consumer-grade client CPU but we
observe an unexpected slowdown of ~15x, however, our evaluation results help us

machine learning pipelines. The central problem in data trading is to estimate
the utility of a seller's dataset with respect to a given buyer's machine
learning task, also known as data valuation. Typically, data valuation requires
one or more participants to share their raw dataset with others, leading to
potential risks of intellectual property (IP) violations. In this paper, we
tackle the novel task of preemptively protecting the IP of datasets that need
to be shared during data valuation. First, we identify and formalize two kinds
of novel IP risks in visual datasets: data-item (image) IP and statistical
(dataset) IP. Then, we propose a novel algorithm to convert the raw dataset
into a sanitized version, that provides resistance to IP violations, while at
the same time allowing accurate data valuation. The key idea is to limit the
transfer of information from the raw dataset to the sanitized dataset, thereby
protecting against potential intellectual property violations. Next, we analyze
our method for the likely existence of a solution and immunity against
reconstruction attacks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three
computer vision datasets demonstrating the advantages of our method in

In theory, the model is trained to be exactly the same as the empirical

generate new samples or estimate the likelihood of unseen samples. Likewise,
the overwhelming diversity of distribution learning models calls for a unified
perspective on this subject. This paper provides a mathematical framework such

obtained by adding one $R^{ab}R_{ab}$ term to the Starobinsky model. We discuss
the possibility of various cosmic evolutions with a special focus on the
radiation-dominated era (RDE). Using simple assumptions, a second-order
non-linear differential equation describing the various cosmic evolutions in
the eSM is introduced. By solving this non-linear equation numerically, we show
that the various cosmic evolutions, such as the standard cosmic evolution ($a
\propto t^{1/2}$) and a unique oscillating cosmic evolution, are feasible due
to the effects of higher-order terms introduced beyond Einstein's gravity.
Furthermore, we consider big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which is the most
important observational result in the RDE, to constrain the free parameters of
the eSM. The primordial abundances of the light elements, such as $^{4}$He, D,
$^{3}$He, $^{7}$Li, and $^{6}$Li by the cosmic evolutions are compared with the
most recent observational data. It turns out that most non-standard cosmic
evolutions can not easily satisfy these BBN constraints, but a free parameter
of the viable models with the oscillating cosmic evolution is shown to have an
upper limit by the constraints. In particular, we find that the free parameter
is most sensitive to deuterium and $^4$He abundances, which are being precisely
measured among other elements. Therefore, more accurate measurements in the
near future may enable us to distinguish the eSM from the standard model as
well as other models.

Discrete flavour symmetry groups like $A_4$ can be incorporated to explain the
flavour structure of particles. But, so far, nothing is known about dynamics of
flavour symmetry - scale of its breaking, or VEV alignment of the flavon
fields. In a recent study [1], we have investigated and shed light on how to
pinpoint the favoured VEV alignment of the flavon field using light neutrino

among them. We also discuss about the estimated value of the constant $F$ which
can constrain various coupling constants of the model, cut-off scale of the
theory and scale of flavour symmetry breaking. This study can provide useful
insight into the hitherto unknown dynamics of flavour symmetry and hence can
contribute as an important ingredient in the model building for future studies.

DR, the flow is divided into two components, `mean flow' and `turbulence',
where `turbulence' includes a broad spectrum of spatial scales. The features of
the AMT are expected to depend on the scale. In this study, we decompose the
angular momentum flux (AMF) to investigate the dependence of the AMF on the
spatial scale. We compare the results with anti-solar- (fast pole) and
solar-type (fast equator) DR. Our conclusions are summarized as 1. Radially
outward AMT is seen on a large scale (60 Mm < L <120 Mm) in rotationally
constrained systems. 2. Even when the scale-integrated AMF is negative, we
sometimes observe positive AMF on certain scales. 3. Small-scale turbulence
tends to transport the angular momentum radially inward and causes the
anti-solar DR, indicating that high-resolution simulation is a negative factor
for solar-like DR. Our method to decompose the AMF provides a deep

explosive growth, because its effects on human technologies have become more

interplanetary space, in the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere and at the
ground. The paper shows that the risks associated with Space Weather have not
been constant over time; they have evolved as our society becomes more and more
technologically advanced. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the
Carrington event. Next, the descriptions of the strongest known Space Weather
processes are reviewed. The concepts of geomagnetic storms and substorms are

interaction among plasma constituents. The photon production rate from a
thermally equilibrated system is proportional to the transverse spectral
function $\rho_T(\omega=|\vec k|, \vec k)$. One can also calculate the photon
production rate from the difference between $\rho_T(\omega,\vec k)$
(transverse) and $\rho_L(\omega,\vec k)$ (longitudinal) projections, as
$\rho_L$ vanishes on the photon point. Because the UV part of $\rho_T-\rho_L$
is suppressed, the corresponding Euclidean correlator receives most of its
contribution from the IR part. We calculate the $T\!-\!L$ correlator on
$N_f=2+1$ flavour HISQ configurations with $m_l=m_s/5$ at temperature of about
$1.15\,T_{pc}$ (220 MeV). We have used two ans\""{a}tze for the spectral
function: 1) A polynomial connected to the UV region consistent with OPE
expansion and 2) a hydro-inspired spectral function. We have also applied the
Backus-Gilbert method to estimate the spectral function. All these different
approaches are combined to estimate the photon production rate.

increasing attention due to their excellent performance in robotic vision. Most
recent works focus on designing curricula based on difficulty levels in input

learning utility in a curriculum manner is still unexplored. In this work, we
design a paced curriculum by label smoothing (P-CBLS) using paced learning with
uniform label smoothing (ULS) for classification tasks and fuse uniform and
spatially varying label smoothing (SVLS) for semantic segmentation tasks in a
curriculum manner. In ULS and SVLS, a bigger smoothing factor value enforces a
heavy smoothing penalty in the true label and limits learning less information.
Therefore, we design the curriculum by label smoothing (CBLS). We set a bigger
smoothing value at the beginning of training and gradually decreased it to zero
to control the model learning utility from lower to higher. We also designed a
confidence-aware pacing function and combined it with our CBLS to investigate
the benefits of various curricula. The proposed techniques are validated on
four robotic surgery datasets of multi-class, multi-label classification,
captioning, and segmentation tasks. We also investigate the robustness of our
method by corrupting validation data into different severity levels. Our
extensive analysis shows that the proposed method improves prediction accuracy

  Intelligence",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers play
important roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method to
co-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the
hyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one
responsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the
control of the robot.
  The key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it
does not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate
processes. Similar to nature, our method derives both the ""brain"" and the
""body"" of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our
approach is more realistic and doesn't require an arbitrary separation of
processes during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the
search space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the
genome affects ""brain"" and the ""body"" at the same time.
  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into
consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the
similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very
different bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots
with different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they
won't crossover with other robots that are too different from them.
  We evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the
search space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process
converge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.
The agents in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of
regularity and controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the
necessary movements.

rotations of the (generic) helical edge states. To this end, we first map the
edge states of the ribbon geometry into an effective two-leg ladder model with
momentum-dependent energy parameters. Then, we split the Hamiltonian of the
system into an unperturbed part and a perturbation. The unperturbed part has a
flat-band energy spectrum and can be solved exactly which allows us to consider
the remaining part of the Hamiltonian perturbatively. The resulting energy
dispersion relation within the first-order perturbation, surprisingly, is in
excellent agreement with the numerical spectra over a very wide range of
wavenumbers. Our perturbative framework also allows deriving an explicit form

bandwidth and involves large propagation delays. Federated Learning (FL) offers
a promising solution because it allows data to stay in-situ (never leaving
satellites) and it only needs to transmit machine learning model parameters
(trained on the satellites' data). However, the conventional, synchronous FL
process can take several days to train a single FL model in the context of
satellite communication (Satcom), due to a bottleneck caused by straggler
satellites. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous FL framework for LEO
constellations called AsyncFLEO to improve FL efficiency in Satcom. Not only
does AsynFLEO address the bottleneck (idle waiting) in synchronous FL, but it
also solves the issue of model staleness caused by straggler satellites.

The resulting signature is characterised by non-isolated $\tau$ lepton pairs

existing CMS and ATLAS analyses. We propose a set of variables that leverage
the leptonic content of the jet and exploit them in a supervised jet tagger to
enhance the signal-to-background separation. Furthermore, we discuss the
performance and limitations of current triggers for accessing sub-TeV $Z'$

access such low mass regions. We estimate that with the currently available

to a competition between medium-induced suppression and, at least for
charmonia, a recombination mechanism in medium or at hadronization. The
measurement of quarkonium production in proton-proton (pp) collisions is also

organic or inorganic. Recently phase-based ""dark-field"" x-ray imaging
approaches have emerged that are sensitive to complementary features of a
material, namely its unresolved microstructure. It can therefore be speculated
that their inclusion in the security-based imaging could enhance material
discrimination, for example of materials with similar electron densities and Z
eff but different microstructures. In this paper, we present a preliminary
evaluation of the advantages that such a combination could bear. Utilising an
energy-resolved detector for a phase-based dark-field technique provides
dual-energy attenuation and dark-field images simultaneously. In addition,
since we use a method based on attenuating x-ray masks to generate the
dark-field images, a fifth (attenuation) image at a much higher photon energy
is obtained by exploiting the x-rays transmitted through the highly absorbing
mask septa. In a first test, a threat material is imaged against a non-threat
one, and we show how their discrimination based on maximising their relative
contrast through linear combinations of two and five imaging channels leads to
an improvement in the latter case. We then present a second example to show how
the method can be extended to discrimination against more than one non-threat
material, obtaining similar results. Albeit admittedly preliminary, these
results indicate that significant margins of improvement in material
discrimination are available by including additional x-ray contrasts in the
scanning process.

inference problems. State-of-the-art Langevin samplers such as the Ensemble
Kalman Sampler (EKS), Affine Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) or its
extension using weighted covariance estimates rely on successive evaluations of
the forward model or its gradient. A main drawback of these methods hence is
their vast number of required forward calls as well as their possible lack of
convergence in the case of more involved posterior measures such as multimodal
distributions. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges to some
extend. First, several possible adaptive ensemble enrichment strategies that
successively enlarge the number of particles in the underlying Langevin
dynamics are discusses that in turn lead to a significant reduction of the
total number of forward calls. Second, analytical consistency guarantees of the
ensemble enrichment method are provided for linear forward models. Third, to
address more involved target distributions, the method is extended by applying
adapted Langevin dynamics based on a homotopy formalism for which convergence
is proved. Finally, numerical investigations of several benchmark problems
illustrates the possible gain of the proposed method, comparing it to
state-of-the-art Langevin samplers.

SNe Ia at specific epochs with optimal surveys. The 2.5-m Wide Field Survey

learning based head detection is a promising method for crowd counting.
However, the highly concerned object detection networks cannot be well applied
to this field for three reasons: (1) The sample imbalance has not been overcome
yet in highly dense and complex scenes because the existing loss functions
calculate the positive loss at a single key point or in the entire target area
with the same weight for all pixels; (2) The canonical object detectors' loss
calculation is a hard assignment without taking into account the space
coherence from the object location to the background region; and (3) Most of
the existing head detection datasets are only annotated with the center points
instead of bounding boxes which is mandatory for the canonical detectors. To
address these problems, we propose a novel loss function, called Mask Focal

knowledge is unavailable (KU). Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are derived. We also provide
the corresponding asymptotic expressions when the backhaul links are unreliable

show that in the backhaul KA scenario, the asymptotic SOP and the slope of the

Many precision experiments have been performed to search for such interactions,

search for the exotic spin-spin interactions that can be mediated by axions or
Z$^\prime$ bosons. A sensitive functionalized cantilever is utilized as a force
sensor to measure the interactions between the spin-polarized electrons in a
periodic magnetic source structure and a closed-loop magnetic structure
integrated on the cantilever. The source is set to oscillate during data
acquisition to modulate the exotic force signal to high harmonics of the
oscillating frequency. This helps to suppress the spurious signals at the
signal frequency. Different magnetic source structures are designed for
different interaction detections. A magnetic stripe structure is designed for
Z$^\prime$-mediated interaction, which is insensitive to the detection of
axion-mediated interaction. This allows us to measure the coupling constant of
both if we assume both exist. With the force sensitivity achievable at low
temperature, the proposed experiments are expected to search for the parameter
spaces with much smaller coupling constant than the current stringent
constraints from micrometer to millimeter range. Specifically, the lower bound
of the parameter space will be seven orders of magnitude lower than the
stringent constraints for Z$^\prime$-mediated interaction, and an order of

resolution. We conduct systematic benchmarking studies and provide a comparison
of current LLIE algorithms. As a second contribution, we introduce LLFormer, a
transformer-based low-light enhancement method. The core components of LLFormer
are the axis-based multi-head self-attention and cross-layer attention fusion
block, which significantly reduces the linear complexity. Extensive experiments
on the new dataset and existing public datasets show that LLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also show that employing existing LLIE methods
trained on our benchmark as a pre-processing step significantly improves the
performance of downstream tasks, e.g., face detection in low-light conditions.

generation and tracking control of tail-sitter UAVs. Theoretically, we focus on
the differential flatness property with full exploitation of actual UAV
aerodynamic models, which lays a foundation for generating dynamically feasible
trajectory and achieving high-performance tracking control. We have found that
a tail-sitter is differentially flat with accurate aerodynamic models within
the entire flight envelope, by specifying coordinate flight condition and
choosing the vehicle position as the flat output. This fundamental property
allows us to fully exploit the high-fidelity aerodynamic models in the
trajectory planning and tracking control to achieve accurate tail-sitter
flights. Particularly, an optimization-based trajectory planner for
tail-sitters is proposed to design high-quality, smooth trajectories with
consideration of kinodynamic constraints, singularity-free constraints and
actuator saturation. The planned trajectory of flat output is transformed to
state trajectory in real-time with consideration of wind in environments. To
track the state trajectory, a global, singularity-free, and
minimally-parameterized on-manifold MPC is developed, which fully leverages the
accurate aerodynamic model to achieve high-accuracy trajectory tracking within
the whole flight envelope. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive real-world experiments in both indoor and
outdoor field tests, including agile SE(3) flight through consecutive narrow

mapping. By examining the different model ingredients that can affect the
derived back-mapped position, we aim to provide a more precise estimate of the
source location and a measure of confidence in the mapping procedure. This can
be used to improve the connection of remote sensing with in situ measurements.
For the ballistic mapping we created custom velocity profiles. These profiles
are constrained by observations of the fast solar wind close to the Sun and are
used to examine the mapping uncertainty. The coronal magnetic field topology
from the solar surface up to the source surface is modeled with a PFSS
extrapolation. The sensitivity of the extrapolated field is examined by adding
noise to the input magnetogram and performing a Monte Carlo simulation, where
for multiple noise realizations we calculate the source position of the solar
wind. Next, the effect of free parameters, like the height of the source
surface, is examined and statistical estimates are derived. We used Gaussian
Mixture clustering to group the back-mapped points, due to different sources of
uncertainty, and provide a confidence area for the source location of the solar
wind. Furthermore, we computed a number of metrics to evaluate the back-mapping
results and assessed their statistical significance by examining 3 high speed
stream events. Lastly, we explored the effect of corotation, close to the Sun,
on the source region of the solar wind. Our results show that the height of the
source surface produces the largest uncertainty in the source region of the
fast solar wind, followed by the choice of the velocity profile and the noise
in the input magnetogram. Additionally, we display the ability to derive a
confidence area on the solar surface that represents the potential source
region of the in-situ measured fast solar wind.

  Restricting the $s$-weak order to certain trees gives rise to the $s$-Tamari

that the $s$-Tamari lattice can be obtained as a quotient lattice of the
$s$-weak order when $s$ has no zeros, and show that the $s$-Tamari lattices
(for arbitrary $s$) are isomorphic to the $\nu$-Tamari lattices of
Pr\'eville-Ratelle and Viennot.

study with applications ranging from practical verification of quantum devices
to deep complexity theoretic results. Self-testing allows a classical verifier
to deduce which quantum measurements and on what state are used, for example,
by provers Alice and Bob in a nonlocal game. Hence, self-testing as well as its
noise-tolerant cousin -- robust self-testing -- are desirable features for a
nonlocal game to have.
  Contrary to what one might expect, we have a rather incomplete understanding
of if and how self-testing could fail to hold. In particular, could it be that
every 2-party nonlocal game or Bell inequality with a quantum advantage
certifies the presence of a specific quantum state? Also, is it the case that
every self-testing result can be turned robust with enough ingeniuty and
effort? We answer these questions in the negative by providing simple and fully
explicit counterexamples. To this end, given two nonlocal games $\mathcal{G}_1$

factorizations of the difference of the superpotentials, and their fusion is
modelled by the tensor product of the factorizations. The effect of fusing a
fixed interface gives rise to a functor on the category of matrix
factorizations. For at least some interfaces, this can be lifted to a functor
on the category of modules over polynomial rings. These fusion functors provide
an alternative way of modelling interfaces between Landau-Ginzburg models that
characterizes interfaces by their fusion properties. Interface fields
correspond to morphisms between fusion functors that can be defined via a
Hochschild-type cohomology. This leads to a strict monoidal supercategory of
fusion functors, where horizontal composition is given by composition of
functors. The category of fusion functors can be related to the category of
matrix factorizations by a functor that maps a fusion functor to the
corresponding interface factorization. It is not faithful, but we prove that it
is full for polynomial rings in one variable. The description of interfaces in
terms of fusion functors has the advantage that fusion of interfaces becomes
simple. It provides a computational tool to evaluate tensor products of matrix
factorizations, and could be applied for example in Kazama-Suzuki models to
analyse fusion categories of rational defects, or in the context of

factors impede the performance optimization of HLS designs implemented on
multi-die FPGAs. On the one hand, the long net delay due to nets crossing
die-boundaries results in an NP-hard problem to properly floorplan and pipeline
an application. On the other hand, traditional automated searching flow for HLS
directive optimizations targets single-die FPGAs, and hence, it cannot consider
the resource constraints on each die and the timing issue incurred by the
die-crossings. Further, it leads to an excessively long runtime to legalize the
floorplan of HLS designs generated under each group of configurations during
directive optimization due to the large design scale.
  To co-optimize the directives and floorplan of HLS designs on multi-die
FPGAs, we propose the FADO framework, which formulates the directive-floorplan
co-search problem based on the multi-choice multi-dimensional bin-packing and
solves it using an iterative optimization flow. For each step of directive
search, a latency-bottleneck-guided greedy algorithm searches for more
efficient directive configurations. For floorplanning, instead of repetitively
incurring global floorplanning algorithms, we implement a more efficient
incremental floorplan legalization algorithm. It mainly applies the worst-fit
online bin-packing algorithm to balance the floorplan, together with an offline
best-fit-decreasing re-packing to compact the floorplan, followed by pipelining
of long wires crossing die-boundaries.
  Through experiments on HLS designs mixing dataflow and non-dataflow kernels,
FADO not only well-automates the co-optimization and finishes within 693X~4925X
shorter runtime, compared with DSE assisted by global floorplanning, but also
yields an improvement of 1.16X~8.78X in overall workflow execution time after
implementation on the Xilinx Alveo U250 FPGA.

domain-wall fermion, the chiral edge modes appear localized at the wall, whose
Dirac operator contains the induced gravitational potential as well as the
$U(1)$ vector potential. In the case of $S^1$ domain-wall fermion on a
two-dimensional flat lattice, we find a competition between the
Aharonov-Bohm(AB) effect and gravitational gap in the Dirac eigenvalue
spectrum, which leads to anomaly of the time-reversal ($T$) symmetry. Our
numerical result shows a good consistency with the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index
theorem on a disk inside the $S^1$ domain-wall, which describes the
cancellation of the $T$ anomaly between the bulk and edge. When the $U(1)$ flux
is squeezed inside one plaquette, and the AB phase takes a quantized value
$\pi$ mod $2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, the anomaly inflow drastically changes: the strong
flux creates another domain-wall around the flux to make the two zero modes
coexist. This phenomenon is also observed in the $S^2$ domain-wall fermion in
the presence of a magnetic monopole. We find that the domain-wall creation
around the monopole microscopically explains the Witten effect.

limiting the adoption of blockchains. Blockchain sharding is a promising
approach to this problem. However, the sharding mechanism introduces a
significant number of cross-shard transactions, which are expensive to process.
  This paper focuses on the transaction allocation problem to reduce the number
of cross-shard transactions for better scalability. In particular, we
systematically formulate the transaction allocation problem and convert it to
the community detection problem on a graph. A deterministic and fast allocation
scheme TxAllo is proposed to dynamically infer the allocation of accounts and
their associated transactions. It directly optimizes the system throughput,
considering both the number of cross-shard transactions and the workload
balance among shards.
  We evaluate the performance of TxAllo on an Ethereum dataset containing over
91 million transactions. Our evaluation results show that for a blockchain with
60 shards, TxAllo reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio from 98% (by using
traditional hash-based allocation) to about 12%. In the meantime, the workload
balance is well maintained. Compared with other methods, the execution time of
TxAllo is almost negligible. For example, when updating the allocation every
hour, the execution of TxAllo only takes 0.5 seconds on average, whereas other
concurrent works, such as BrokerChain (INFOCOM'22) leveraging the classic METIS
method, require 422 seconds.

different types of embodied energy sources and the time evolution of the

directed and weighted temporal multilayer network based respectively on
renewable and non-renewable sources, where sectors are nodes and layers are
countries. We provide a methodological approach for analysing the network

topological indicator based on the maximum flow problem. In this way, we
provide a full view of economies, sectors and connections that play a relevant
role over time in the network and whose removal could heavily affect the

increased fuel consumption and collisions. Traffic jams without a clear cause,
such as an on-ramp or an accident, are called phantom traffic jams and are said
to make up 50% of all traffic jams. They are the result of an unstable traffic
flow caused by human driving behavior. Automating the longitudinal vehicle
motion of only 5% of all cars in the flow can dissipate phantom traffic jams.
However, driving automation introduces safety issues when human drivers need to
take over the control from the automation. We investigated whether phantom
traffic jams can be dissolved using haptic shared control. This keeps humans in
the loop and thus bypasses the problem of humans' limited capacity to take over
control, while benefiting from most advantages of automation. In an experiment
with 24 participants in a driving simulator, we tested the effect of haptic
shared control on the dynamics of traffic flow, and compared it with manual
control and full automation. We also investigated the effect of two control
types on participants' behavior during simulated silent automation failures.
Results show that haptic shared control can help dissipating phantom traffic
jams better than fully manual control but worse than full automation. We also
found that haptic shared control reduces the occurrence of unsafe situations
caused by silent automation failures compared to full automation. Our results
suggest that haptic shared control can dissipate phantom traffic jams while
preventing safety risks associated with full automation.

per two qubits. The individual magnets are ""U""-shaped, such that the magnetic
shape anisotropy orients the magnetization alternately towards and against the
qubit chain even if an external magnetic field is applied along the qubit
chain. The longitudinal and transversal stray field components serve as
addressability and driving fields. Using micromagnetic simulations we calculate
driving and dephasing rates and the corresponding qubit quality factor. The
concept is validated with spin-polarized scanning electron microscopy of Fe
nanomagnets fabricated on silicon substrates, finding excellent agreement with
micromagnetic simulations. Several features required for a scalable spin qubit
design are met in our approach: strong driving and weak dephasing gradients,
reduced crosstalk and operation at low external magnetic field.

  via Dual Decoders",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic image colorization is a challenging problem. Due to the high
illness and multi-modal uncertainty, directly training a deep neural network
usually leads to incorrect semantic colors and low color richness. Recent
transformer-based methods can deliver better results, but they often rely on
manually designed priors, which are hard to implement and suffer from poor
generalization ability. Moreover, they tend to introduce serious color bleeding
effects since color attention is performed on single-scale features, thus fail
to exploit sufficient semantic information. To address these issues, we propose
DDColor, a new end-to-end method with dual decoders for image colorization. Our
approach includes a multi-scale image decoder and a transformer-based color
decoder. The former restores the spatial resolution of the image, while the
latter establishes the correlation between color and semantic representations
via cross-attention. Rather than using additional priors, our two decoders work
together to leverage multi-scale image features to guide optimization of
adaptive color queries, significantly alleviating color bleeding effects. In
addition, a simple yet effective colorfulness loss is introduced to further
enhance the color richness of generated results. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that DDColor achieves significantly superior performance to
existing state-of-the-art works both quantitatively and qualitatively. Codes

potential to outperform classical machine learning methods in problems
pertaining classification and identification tasks. A subclass of QML methods
is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) which have been studied as a
quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used in image manipulation and
generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still limited to small-scale
proof-of-concept examples based on images with significant downscaling. Here we
integrate classical and quantum techniques to propose a new hybrid
quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its superior learning
capabilities by generating $28 \times 28$ pixels grey-scale images without
dimensionality reduction or classical pre/post-processing on multiple classes
of the standard MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, which achieves comparable
results to classical frameworks with three orders of magnitude less trainable
generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working of our hybrid
approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter space by
varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of layers
in the generator, the shape of the patches and the choice of prior
distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size
generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed
framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal

of phase-induced and size-induced tipping. The conclusions are applied in

phenomena causing extinction of a native species or invasion of a non-native

quasi-isolated Cu$^{2+}$ ions. This combination determines peculiar physical
properties of this compound evidenced in electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectroscopy, dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$, magnetization $M$ and
specific heat $C_p$ measurements. At lowering temperature, the magnetic
susceptibility $\chi = M/H$ passes through broad hump at about 150 K inherent
for low-dimensional magnetic systems and evidences sharp peak at
antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N = 3.2 $K. The $C_p(T)$ curve also
exhibits sharp peak at $T_N$ readily suppressed by magnetic field and
additional peak-like anomaly at $T_\textrm{peak}= 5.7$ K robust to magnetic
field. The latter can be ascribed to low-lying singlet excitations filling the
singlet-triplet gap in magnetic excitation spectrum of the square kagome
lattice [J.Richter, O.Derzhko and J.Schnack, Phys. Rev. B 105, 144427 (2022)].
According to position of $T_\textrm{peak}$, the leading exchange interaction
parameter $J$ in nabokoite is estimated to be about 60K. ESR spectroscopy
provides indications that antiferromagnetic structure below $T_N$ is
non-collinear. These complex thermodynamic and resonant properties signal the
presence of two weakly coupled magnetic subsystems in nabokoite, namely
spin-liquid with large singlet-triplet gap and antiferromagnet represented by
decorating ions. Separate issue is the observation of antiferroelectric-type
behavior in $\varepsilon$ at low temperatures, which tentatively reduces the
symmetry and partially lifts frustration of magnetic interactions of decorating
copper ions with buckled square kagome lattice.

strategy for quantum surface codes. However, it suffers a harsh decrease in
performance when subjected to biased or non-identical quantum noise. In this
work, we modify the conventional MWPM decoder so that it considers the biases,
the non-uniformities and the relationship between $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ errors of
the constituent qubits of a given surface code. Our modified approach, which we
refer to as the recursive MWPM decoder, obtains an $18\%$ improvement in the
probability threshold $p_{th}$ under depolarizing noise. We also obtain
significant performance improvements when considering biased noise and
independent non-identically distributed (i.ni.d.) error models derived from
measurements performed on state-of-the-art quantum processors. In fact, when
subjected to i.ni.d. noise, the recursive MWPM decoder yields a performance
improvement of $105.5\%$ over the conventional MWPM strategy and, in some
cases, it even surpasses the performance obtained over the well-known
depolarizing channel.

  revealed by JWST NIRSpec Spectroscopy","Submitted",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The confirmation of the presence of very massive quiescent galaxies at epochs
only 1-2 Gyr after the Big Bang [1-8] has challenged models of cosmology and
galaxy formation [9]. Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant
numbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient
time for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as
rapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr[3] at
redshifts $3<z<4$. The true number and ages of these objects have however been
highly uncertain as ground-based spectra has been limited to the brightest of
them [e.g. 3, 5], at wavelengths ~2$\mu$m, which introduces a signficant
potential bias towards younger objects [7]. The launch of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) enables dramatically more sensitive and constraining
spectroscopic observations due to the very low sky background, sharp image
quality, and access to wavelengths beyond 2{\mu}m. Here we report JWST NIRSpec
[10] (0.6-5.3$\mu$m) observations of five new quiescent galaxy candidates that
were beyond the limit of previous ground-based spectroscopy. The high
signal:noise spectra of galaxies with continuum significantly fainter than
earlier confirmations show that they are also at redshifts 3<z<4, and that they
have substantial stellar masses of ~0.5-1.2x1011 M$\odot$ comparable to massive
galaxies in the nearby Universe. One of the galaxies has been quenched for >~ 1
billion years pointing to a presence of substantially older and fainter
galaxies than those revealed so far by ground-based spectroscopy. This suggests
that some of the massive galaxies have very early formation epochs (during the
epoch of reionization, z >~ 6) pointing to a need for high conversion rates of
baryons to stars in the first massive galaxy halos in the early Universe [11,
12].

provided stellar parameters and chemical abundances measured from the RVS
spectra alone. However, very metal-poor stars (VMP stars; $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-2$)
suffer from parameter degeneracy due to a lack of information in their spectra,
making it difficult to obtain reliable stellar parameters and metallicities for
many of them. Aim: We aim to improve metallicity estimates for VMP stars
analysed by the GSP-Spec module. Methods: We compute the Ca triplet equivalent
widths from the published set of GSP-Spec stellar parameters. We then convert
these obtained equivalent widths to metallicities adopting photometric
temperatures and surface gravities that we derive based on Gaia and 2MASS
catalogs. Results: Comparison to high-resolution studies shows that our
approach drastically reduces the cases where the estimated metallicities are
far off for VMP stars. Now only $23\%$ of VMP stars have a metallicity
different by more than $0.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ from a high-resolution value, while
this fraction is $76\%$ with the original metallicity estimates by the GSP-Spec
module. We explore possible ways to remove stars with poor metallicity
estimates while keeping as many stars with reliable metallicity as possible.
Our improved metallicity estimates and new quality cut result in producing a
catalog of bright ($G\lesssim 13$) metal-poor stars, containing 57 stars at
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-3$ and 2202 VMP stars. These numbers increase to 174 and 2794
if one allows a low level of metal-rich contaminants. Conclusion: The inclusion
of photometric information greatly contributes to breaking parameter
degeneracy, enabling precise metallicity estimates for VMP stars from Gaia RVS
spectra. We produce a publicly-available catalog of bright metal-poor stars
suitable for high-resolution follow-up.

an array of metal-semiconductor-metal patches hosting a judiciously designed

intensity the structure operates in the strong light-matter coupling regime and
exhibits two absorption peaks at wavelengths close to 8.9 $\mu$m. Saturation
appears as a transition to the weak coupling regime - and therefore to a
single-peaked absorption - when increasing the incident intensity. Comparison
with a coupled mode theory model explains the data and permits to infer the
relevant system parameters. When the pump laser is tuned at the cavity
frequency, the reflectivity decreases with increasing incident intensity. When
instead the laser is tuned at the polariton frequencies, the reflectivity
non-linearly increases with increasing incident intensity. At those wavelengths
the system therefore mimics the behavior of a saturable absorption mirror
(SESAM) in the mid-IR range, a technology that is currently missing.

whose design is inspired by the ""Predictive Coding"" theories and ""Coarse to

bottom-up and top-down information flows, which is different from traditional
bottom-up training style. Its advantage is to reduce the dependence on input
information and improve its ability to predict and generate images.
Importantly, we achieve with a multi-scale approach -- higher level neurons
generate coarser predictions (lower resolution), while the lower level generate
finer predictions (higher resolution). This is different from the traditional
predictive coding framework in which higher level predict the activity of
neurons in lower level. To improve the predictive ability, we integrate an
encoder-decoder network in the LSTM architecture and share the final encoded
high-level semantic information between different levels. Additionally, since
the output of each network level is an RGB image, a smaller LSTM hidden state
can be used to retain and update the only necessary hidden information,
avoiding being mapped to an overly discrete and complex space. In this way, we
can reduce the difficulty of prediction and the computational overhead.
Finally, we further explore the training strategies, to address the instability
in adversarial training and mismatch between training and testing in long-term
prediction. Code is available at https://github.com/Ling-CF/MSPN.

modifies the post-pulse orientation of the polariton, making it difficult to

toward achieving complete quantum coherent control, we derive an analytical
solution of a pulse-driven quantum Jaynes-Cummings model by expanding the wave

utilize it to design a composite terahertz pulse and obtain the maximum degree
of orientation of the polariton by exploiting photon blockade effects. This

  Learning","7 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) protects logical qubits by
engineered dissipation and thus circumvents the necessity of frequent,
error-prone measurement-feedback loops. Bosonic code spaces, where
single-photon loss represents the dominant source of error, are promising
candidates for AQEC due to their flexibility and controllability. While
existing proposals have demonstrated the in-principle feasibility of AQEC with
bosonic code spaces, these schemes are typically based on the exact
implementation of the Knill-Laflamme conditions and thus require the
realization of Hamiltonian distances $d\geq 2$. Implementing such Hamiltonian
distances requires multiple nonlinear interactions and control fields,
rendering these schemes experimentally challenging. Here, we propose a bosonic
code for approximate AQEC by relaxing the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Using
reinforcement learning (RL), we identify the optimal bosonic set of codewords
(denoted here by RL code), which, surprisingly, is comprised of the Fock states
$\vert 2\rangle$ and $\vert 4\rangle$. As we show, the RL code, despite its
approximate nature, successfully suppresses single-photon loss, reducing it to
an effective dephasing process that well surpasses the break-even threshold. It
may thus provide a valuable building block toward full error protection. The
error-correcting Hamiltonian, which includes ancilla systems that emulate the
engineered dissipation, is entirely based on the Hamiltonian distance $d=1$,
significantly reducing model complexity. Single-qubit gates are implemented in
the RL code with a maximum distance $d_g=2$.

at time $t$ is a functional of its past activity before time $t$. It is defined
by its activation function $\Phi$ and its memory function $h$. In this paper,
the Hawkes property is expressed as an operator on the sub-space of
non-negative sequences associated to distances between its points. By using the
classical correspondence between a stationary point process and its Palm
measure, we establish a characterization of the corresponding Palm measure as
an invariant distribution of a Markovian kernel. We prove that if $\Phi$ is
continuous and its growth rate is at most linear with a rate below some
constant, then there exists a stationary Hawkes point process. The classical
Lipschitz condition of the literature for an unbounded function $\Phi$ is
relaxed. Our proofs rely on a combination of coupling methods, monotonicity
properties of linear Hawkes processes and classical results on Palm
distributions. An investigation of the Hawkes process starting from the null
measure on $\mathbb{R}_-$, the empty state, plays also an important role. The
linear case of Hawkes and Oakes is revisited at this occasion.
  If the memory function $h$ is an exponential function, under a weak condition
it is shown that there exists a stationary Hawkes point process. In this case,
its Palm measure is expressed in terms of the invariant distribution of a
one-dimensional Harris ergodic Markov chain. When the activation function is a
polynomial $\Phi$ with degree ${>}1$, there does not exist a stationary Hawkes
process and if the Hawkes process starts from the empty state, a scaling result
for the accumulation of its points is obtained.

the violation of Bell-like inequalities. Roughly speaking the Grothendieck
theorem considers a `classical' quadratic form ${\cal C}$ that uses complex
numbers in the unit disc, and takes values less than $1$. It then proves that
if the complex numbers are replaced with vectors in the unit ball of the
Hilbert space, then the `quantum' quadratic form ${\cal Q}$ might take values
greater than $1$, up to the complex Grothendieck constant $k_G$. The
Grothendieck theorem is reformulated here in terms of arbitrary matrices (which
are multiplied with appropriate normalisation prefactors), so that it is
directly applicable to quantum quantities. The emphasis in the paper is in the
`Grothendieck region' $(1,k_G)$, which is a classically forbidden region in the
sense that ${\cal C}$ cannot take values in it. Necessary (but not sufficient)
conditions for ${\cal Q}$ taking values in the Grothendieck region are given.
Two examples that involve physical quantities in systems with $6$ and
$12$-dimensional Hilbert space, are shown to lead to ${\cal Q}$ in the
Grothendieck region $(1,k_G)$. They involve projectors of the overlaps of novel
generalised coherent states that resolve the identity and have a discrete
isotropy.

applications. Commonly, the autonomous navigation task is carried out by a
fusion between two sensors: the inertial navigation system and the Doppler

sea floor, and once reflected back, the AUV velocity vector can be estimated.
However, in real-life scenarios, such as an uneven seabed, sea creatures
blocking the DVL's view and, roll/pitch maneuvers, the acoustic beams'
reflection is resulting in a scenario known as DVL outage. Consequently, a
velocity update is not available to bind the inertial solution drift. To cope
with such situations, in this paper, we leverage our BeamsNet framework and
propose a Set-Transformer-based BeamsNet (ST-BeamsNet) that utilizes inertial
data readings and previous DVL velocity measurements to regress the current AUV

replacing the OpenMP parallelization language with OpenACC. In this port,
$\sim$95% of the data is copied from the host to the device at the beginning of

$data$$-$$transfer$ $bound$. The OpenACC code presents a speedup of $\sim$1.5
over the OpenMP version but further optimizations are in progress to obtain

  and the ASM polytope",,,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The weighted projection of an alternating sign matrix (ASM) was introduced by
Brualdi and Dahl (2018) as a step towards characterising a generalisation of
Latin squares they introduced using alternating sign hypermatrices. If $z_n =
(n,\dots,2,1)$, then the weighted projection of an ASM $A$ is equal to
$z_n^TA$. Brualdi and Dahl proved that the weighted projection of an $n \times
n$ ASM is majorized by the vector $z_n$, and conjectured that any positive
integer vector majorized by $z_n$ is the weighted projection of some ASM. The
main result of this paper presents a proof of this conjecture, via monotone
triangles. A relaxation of a monotone triangle, called a row-increasing
triangle, is introduced. It is shown that for any row-increasing triangle $T$,
there exists a monotone triangle $M$ such that each entry of $M$ occurs the
same number of times as in $T$. A construction is also outlined for an ASM with
given weighted projection. The relationship of the main result to existing
results concerning the ASM polytope $ASM_n$ is examined, and a characterisation
is given for the relationship between elements of $ASM_n$ corresponding to the
same point in the permutohedron of order $n$. Finally, the limitations of the
main result for characterising alternating sign hypermatrix Latin-like squares
is considered.

characteristics such as gender or ethnicity, with the aim of predicting
performance and designing interventions to improve outcomes. For Higher
Education, this is reflected in significant interest in institutional-level
analysis of student cohorts and in tools being promoted to Higher Education
Institutions to support collection, integration and analysis of data. For those
leading modules/units on degree programmes, however, the reality can be far
removed from the seemingly well-supported and increasingly sophisticated
approaches advocated in centrally-led data analysis. Module leaders often find
themselves working with a number of student-data systems that are not
integrated, may contain conflicting data and where significant effort is
required to extract, clean and meaningfully analyse the data. This paper
suggests that important lessons may be learned from experiences at module level
in this context and from subsequent analysis of related data collected across
multiple years. The changes made each year are described and a range of data
analysis methods are applied, post hoc, to identify findings in relation to the
four areas of focus. The key findings are that non-engagement with the Virtual
Learning Environment in the first three weeks was the strongest predictor of
failure and that early engagement correlated most strongly with final grade.
General recommendations are drawn from the findings which should be valuable to
module leaders in environments where access to integrated, up-to-date student
information remains a day-to-day challenge, and insights will be presented into
how such bottom-up activities might inform institutional/top-down planning in
the use of relevant technologies.

sufficiently large for the coexistence of all three species to be maintained,
the model asymptotically leads to the formation of spiral patterns whose
evolution is qualitatively similar to that of the standard RPS model, albeit
with larger characteristic length and time scales. We show that there are in
general two distinct scaling regimes: one transient curvature dominated regime
in which the characteristic length of the population network grows with time
and another where it becomes a constant. We also estimate the dependence of the
asymptotic value of the characteristic length of the population network on the

following two parts. First, pseudo-label ensembling generates incomplete but
high-quality pseudo-label sequences, where the frames in ambiguous intervals
have no pseudo-labels. Second, iterative clustering iteratively propagates the
pseudo-labels to the ambiguous intervals by clustering, and thus updates the
pseudo-label sequences to train the model. We further introduce a clustering
loss, which encourages the features of frames within the same action segment
more compact. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

derived six-component polarization models that are valid for pure-state plane
wave arrivals. For efficient classification, we make use of the supervised
machine learning method of support vector machines that is trained using
data-independent, analytically-derived six-component polarization models. This
enables the rapid classification of seismic phases in a fully automated
fashion, even for large data volumes, such as encountered in land-seismic
exploration or ambient noise seismology. Once the wave-type is known,
additional wave parameters (velocity, directionality, and ellipticity) can be
directly extracted from the six-component polarization states without the need
to resort to expensive optimization algorithms.
  We illustrate the benefits of our approach on various real and synthetic data
examples for applications such as automated phase picking, aliased ground-roll
suppression in land-seismic exploration, and the rapid close-to real time
extraction of surface wave dispersion curves from single-station recordings of
ambient noise. Additionally, we argue that an initial step of wave type
classification is necessary in order to successfully apply the common technique
of extracting phase velocities from combined measurements of rotational and
translational motion.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Few-shot learning (FSL) is a central problem in meta-learning, where learners
must efficiently learn from few labeled examples. Within FSL, feature
pre-training has recently become an increasingly popular strategy to
significantly improve generalization performance. However, the contribution of
pre-training is often overlooked and understudied, with limited theoretical
understanding of its impact on meta-learning performance. Further, pre-training
requires a consistent set of global labels shared across training tasks, which
may be unavailable in practice. In this work, we address the above issues by
first showing the connection between pre-training and meta-learning. We discuss
why pre-training yields more robust meta-representation and connect the
theoretical analysis to existing works and empirical results. Secondly, we
introduce Meta Label Learning (MeLa), a novel meta-learning algorithm that
learns task relations by inferring global labels across tasks. This allows us
to exploit pre-training for FSL even when global labels are unavailable or
ill-defined. Lastly, we introduce an augmented pre-training procedure that
further improves the learned meta-representation. Empirically, MeLa outperforms
existing methods across a diverse range of benchmarks, in particular under a
more challenging setting where the number of training tasks is limited and
labels are task-specific. We also provide extensive ablation study to highlight
its key properties.

assignments of values to the diagonals of a triangulated polygon satisfying
certain conditions for crossing diagonals (Ptolemy relations). Weak friezes, as
introduced by Canakci and Jorgensen, are generalizing this concept by allowing
to glue dissected polygons so that the Ptolemy relations only have to be
satisfied for crossings involving one of the gluing diagonals. To any frieze
pattern one can associate a symmetric matrix using a triangular fundamental
domain of the frieze pattern in the upper and lower half of the matrix and
putting zeroes on the diagonal. Broline, Crowe and Isaacs have found a formula

generalized in various directions by other authors. These frieze pattern
determinants are the main focus of our paper. As our main result we show that

determinant is the product of the determinants for the pieces glued, up to a
scalar factor coming from the gluing diagonal. Then we give several

the amount of decisions that the agent needs to perform when learning new

fast learning remains a challenging problem. Recently, several deep learning
approaches were proposed to learn such temporal abstractions in the form of
options in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we point out several
shortcomings of these methods and discuss their potential negative
consequences. Subsequently, we formulate the desiderata for reusable options
and use these to frame the problem of learning options as a gradient-based
meta-learning problem. This allows us to formulate an objective that explicitly
incentivizes options which allow a higher-level decision maker to adjust in few
steps to different tasks. Experimentally, we show that our method is able to
learn transferable components which accelerate learning and performs better
than existing prior methods developed for this setting. Additionally, we
perform ablations to quantify the impact of using gradient-based meta-learning

pathfinding on grids, i.e. graphs of regular structure that are widely employed
to represent environments in robotics, video games etc. Instance-independent
heuristics for grid graphs, e.g. Manhattan distance, do not take the obstacles
into account and, thus, the search led by such heuristics performs poorly in
the obstacle-rich environments. To this end, we suggest learning the
instance-dependent heuristic proxies that are supposed to notably increase the
efficiency of the search. The first heuristic proxy we suggest to learn is the
correction factor, i.e. the ratio between the instance independent cost-to-go
estimate and the perfect one (computed offline at the training phase). Unlike
learning the absolute values of the cost-to-go heuristic function, which was
known before, when learning the correction factor the knowledge of the
instance-independent heuristic is utilized. The second heuristic proxy is the
path probability, which indicates how likely the grid cell is lying on the
shortest path. This heuristic can be utilized in the Focal Search framework as
the secondary heuristic, allowing us to preserve the guarantees on the bounded
sub-optimality of the solution. We learn both suggested heuristics in a
supervised fashion with the state-of-the-art neural networks containing
attention blocks (transformers). We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation on
a comprehensive dataset of planning tasks, showing that the suggested
techniques i) reduce the computational effort of the A* up to a factor of $4$x

solutions by less than $0.3$% on average; ii) outperform the competitors, which

laying the foundations of our evaluation methodology into the theory of

extensive experimentation, on the impact of the different types of scales on
the statistical analyses, as well as on the impact of departing from their
assumptions. Moreover, we investigated, for the first time in IR, the concept
of meaningfulness, i.e. the invariance of the experimental statements and
inferences you draw, and proposed it as a way to ensure more valid and
generalizabile results. Moffat's comments build on: (i) misconceptions about
the representational theory of measurement, such as what an interval scale
actually is and what axioms it has to comply with; (ii) they totally miss the
central concept of meaningfulness. Therefore, we reply to Moffat's comments by
properly framing them in the representational theory of measurement and in the
concept of meaningfulness. All in all, we can only reiterate what we said
several times: the goal of this research line is to theoretically ground our
evaluation methodology - and IR is a field where it is extremely challenging to
perform any theoretical advances - in order to aim for more robust and
generalizable inferences - something we currently lack in the field. Possibly
there are other and better ways to achieve this objective and these proposals
could emerge from an open discussion in the field and from the work of others.
On the other hand, reducing everything to a contrast on what is (or pretend to
be) an interval scale or whether all or none evaluation measures are interval
scales may be more a barrier from than a help in progressing towards this goal.

combinatorics and computer algebra have made determining the asymptotic
behaviour of sequences satisfying linear recurrence relations with polynomial
coefficients largely a matter of routine, under assumptions that hold often in
practice. The algorithms involved typically take a sequence, encoded by a
recurrence relation and initial terms, and return the leading terms in an
asymptotic expansion up to a big-O error term. Less studied, however, are
effective techniques giving an explicit bound on asymptotic error terms. Among
other things, such explicit bounds typically allow the user to automatically
prove sequence positivity (an active area of enumerative and algebraic
combinatorics) by exhibiting an index when positive leading asymptotic
behaviour dominates any error terms. In this article, we present a practical
algorithm for computing such asymptotic approximations with rigorous error
bounds, under the assumption that the generating series of the sequence is a
solution of a differential equation with regular (Fuchsian) dominant
singularities. Our algorithm approximately follows the singularity analysis
method of Flajolet and Odlyzko, except that all big-O terms involved in the
derivation of the asymptotic expansion are replaced by explicit error terms.

with effective techniques from rigorous numerics and computer algebra. We

safety-critical scenarios, thus the analysis of robustness for c-MARL models is
profoundly important. However, robustness certification for c-MARLs has not yet
been explored in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel certification
method, which is the first work to leverage a scalable approach for c-MARLs to
determine actions with guaranteed certified bounds. c-MARL certification poses
two key challenges compared with single-agent systems: (i) the accumulated
uncertainty as the number of agents increases; (ii) the potential lack of
impact when changing the action of a single agent into a global team reward.
These challenges prevent us from directly using existing algorithms. Hence, we
employ the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure considering the
importance of each agent to certify per-state robustness and propose a
tree-search-based algorithm to find a lower bound of the global reward under
the minimal certified perturbation. As our method is general, it can also be

  Angular Spaces",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The classification loss functions used in deep neural network classifiers can
be grouped into two categories based on maximizing the margin in either
Euclidean or angular spaces. Euclidean distances between sample vectors are
used during classification for the methods maximizing the margin in Euclidean
spaces whereas the Cosine similarity distance is used during the testing stage
for the methods maximizing margin in the angular spaces. This paper introduces
a novel classification loss that maximizes the margin in both the Euclidean and
angular spaces at the same time. This way, the Euclidean and Cosine distances
will produce similar and consistent results and complement each other, which
will in turn improve the accuracies. The proposed loss function enforces the
samples of classes to cluster around the centers that represent them. The
centers approximating classes are chosen from the boundary of a hypersphere,
and the pairwise distances between class centers are always equivalent. This
restriction corresponds to choosing centers from the vertices of a regular
simplex. There is not any hyperparameter that must be set by the user in the
proposed loss function, therefore the use of the proposed method is extremely
easy for classical classification problems. Moreover, since the class samples
are compactly clustered around their corresponding means, the proposed
classifier is also very suitable for open set recognition problems where test
samples can come from the unknown classes that are not seen in the training
phase. Experimental studies show that the proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art accuracies on open set recognition despite its simplicity.

are constructed and exploited for the Stokes problem. The moments of order up
to $k-1$ ($k=2,3$) on all the facets of the tetrahedron are used for DoFs
(degrees of freedom) to construct the unisolvent $k$-order nonconforming finite
element with the bubble function space of $P_{k+1}$ explicitly represented. The
pair of the $k$-order element and the discontinuous piecewise $P_{k}$ is proved
to be stable for solving the Stokes problem with the element-wise
divergence-free condition preserved. The main difficulty in establishing the
discrete inf-sup condition comes from the fact that the usual Fortin operator
can not be constructed. Thanks to the explicit representation of the bubble
functions, its divergence space is proved to be identical to the orthogonal
complement space of constants with respect to $P_k$ on the tetrahedron, which
plays an important role to overcome the aforementioned difficulty and leads to
the desirable well-posedness of the discrete problem. Furthermore, a reduced
$k$-order nonconforming finite element with a discontinuous piecewise $P_{k-1}$
is designed and proved to be stable for solving the Stokes problem. The lack of
the Fortin operator causes difficulty in analyzing the discrete inf-sup
condition for the reduced third-order element pair. To deal with this problem,
the so-called macro-element technique is adopted with a crucial algebraic
result concerning the property of functions in the orthogonal complement space
of the divergence of the discrete velocity space with respect to the discrete
pressure space on the macro-element. Numerical experiments are provided to
validate the theoretical results.

adversarial perturbations is due in part to aliasing in neural networks. Our
ultimate goal is to increase robustness against adversarial attacks using
explainable, non-trained, structural changes only, derived from aliasing first

sufficient condition for no aliasing for general image transformations. Next,
we study sources of aliasing in common neural network layers, and derive simple
modifications from first principles to eliminate or reduce it. Lastly, our
experimental results show a solid link between anti-aliasing and adversarial
attacks. Simply reducing aliasing already results in more robust classifiers,

training on $L_2$ attacks with none or minimal losses in performance on

fault-revealing tools in the tester's tool kit. Much previous work implicitly
assumed it to be sufficient to re-compute mutant suites per release. Sadly,
this makes mutation results inconsistent; mutant scores from each release
cannot be directly compared, making it harder to measure test improvement.
Furthermore, regular code change means that a mutant suite's relevance will
naturally degrade over time. We measure this degradation in relevance for
143,500 mutants in 4 non-trivial systems finding that, on overage, 52% degrade.
We introduce a mutant brittleness measure and use it to audit software systems
and their mutation suites. We also demonstrate how consistent-by-construction
long-standing mutant suites can be identified with a 10x improvement in mutant
relevance over an arbitrary test suite. Our results indicate that the research
community should avoid the re-computation of mutant suites and focus, instead,
on long-standing mutants, thereby improving the consistency and relevance of

of both worlds between fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) and
quasiclassical mapping dynamics. This mapping approach to surface hopping
(MASH) propagates the nuclei on the active adiabatic potential-energy surface,
like in FSSH. However, unlike in FSSH, transitions between active surfaces are
deterministic and occur when the electronic mapping variables evolve between
specified regions of the electronic phase space. This guarantees internal
consistency between the active surface and the electronic degrees of freedom
throughout the dynamics. MASH is rigorously derivable from exact quantum
mechanics, as a limit of the quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE),
leading to a unique prescription for momentum rescaling and frustrated hops.
Hence, a quantum-jump procedure can in principle be used to systematically
converge the accuracy of the results to that of the QCLE. This jump procedure
also provides a rigorous framework for deriving approximate decoherence
corrections similar to those proposed for FSSH. We apply MASH to simulate the
nonadiabatic dynamics in various model systems and show that it consistently

which are healthcare, entertainment, transport and logistics, and many more. It
is only natural that with this increasing dependency on software, the number of
software systems increases. Additionally, these systems become more and more
complex. All this leads to a rise in the number of software faults also known
as bugs. As a result, the ability to locate the source of a bug (e.g. a file or
a commit) is vital for the development and maintenance of efficient software
solutions. Bug localization refers to the automated process of discovering
files that contain bugs, based on a bug report. This research project aims to
make a literature review on different techniques for bug localization. This
study distinguishes itself from other surveys and literature reviews [1] in one
significant way. The focus of the work is on identifying, categorizing and
analyzing existing bug localization methods and tools which were evaluated in
an industrial setting. To the best of my knowledge, there are no other works
that prioritise this aspect. Unfortunately, such literature is scarce,
therefore, bug localization techniques evaluated on open source software are
also included.

  networks. Towards parameterized problem inference","22 pages, 30 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in
various fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating
physical laws into the models. PINNs integrate the physical constraints by
minimizing the partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals on a set of
collocation points. The distribution of these collocation points appears to
have a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the
sampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we
propose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Learning (FBOAL) method, which
decomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based
on local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The effectiveness of
FBOAL is demonstrated for non-parameterized and parameterized problems. The
comparison with other adaptive sampling methods is also illustrated. The
numerical results demonstrate important gains in terms of the accuracy and
computational cost of PINNs with FBOAL over the classical PINNs with
non-adaptive collocation points. We also apply FBOAL in a complex industrial
application involving coupling between mechanical and thermal fields. We show
that FBOAL is able to identify the high-gradient locations and even give better
predictions for some physical fields than the classical PINNs with collocation
points sampled on a pre-adapted finite element mesh built thanks to numerical
expert knowledge. From the present study, it is expected that the use of FBOAL
will help to improve the conventional numerical solver in the construction of
the mesh.

  Classification with Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.CR cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a game-theoretic framework to study the interactions of
attack and defense for deep learning-based NextG signal classification. NextG
systems such as the one envisioned for a massive number of IoT devices can
employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for various tasks such as user equipment
identification, physical layer authentication, and detection of incumbent users
(such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band). By training
another DNN as the surrogate model, an adversary can launch an inference
(exploratory) attack to learn the behavior of the victim model, predict
successful operation modes (e.g., channel access), and jam them. A defense
mechanism can increase the adversary's uncertainty by introducing controlled
errors in the victim model's decisions (i.e., poisoning the adversary's
training data). This defense is effective against an attack but reduces the
performance when there is no attack. The interactions between the defender and
the adversary are formulated as a non-cooperative game, where the defender
selects the probability of defending or the defense level itself (i.e., the
ratio of falsified decisions) and the adversary selects the probability of
attacking. The defender's objective is to maximize its reward (e.g., throughput
or transmission success ratio), whereas the adversary's objective is to
minimize this reward and its attack cost. The Nash equilibrium strategies are
determined as operation modes such that no player can unilaterally improve its
utility given the other's strategy is fixed. A fictitious play is formulated
for each player to play the game repeatedly in response to the empirical
frequency of the opponent's actions. The performance in Nash equilibrium is
compared to the fixed attack and defense cases, and the resilience of NextG
signal classification against attacks is quantified.

generalizations and extensions. One direction, initiated by V. Milman is to
replace ellipsoids by positions (affine images) of another body $L$. Another,
more recent direction is to consider logarithmically concave functions on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ instead of convex bodies: we designate some special, radially
symmetric log-concave function $g$ as the analogue of the Euclidean ball, and
want to find its largest integral position under the constraint that it is
pointwise below some given log-concave function $f$.
  We follow both directions simultaneously: we consider the functional
question, and allow essentially any meaningful function to play the role of $g$
above. Our general theorems jointly extend known results in both directions.
  The dual problem in the setting of convex bodies asks for the smallest volume
ellipsoid, called \emph{L{\""o}wner's ellipsoid}, containing $K$. We consider
the analogous problem for functions: we characterize the solutions of the
optimization problem of finding a smallest integral position of some
log-concave function $g$ under the constraint that it is pointwise above $f$.

further give a theory of quantitative effect transformers based on these two
operations, essentially providing quantitive analogues to the following monad
transformers due to Moggi: exception, resumption, reader, and writer
transformers. Finally, as an application we provide the first quantitative
algebraic axiomatizations to the following coalgebraic structures: Markov

the intrinsic interest in these axiomatizations, it is pleasing they have been
obtained as the composition, via sum and tensor, of simpler quantitative

also prove that in the asymptotic region of the space-time, the action density

network models. These attacks heavily depend on the attacker's knowledge of the
application domain, e.g., using it to determine the auxiliary data for
model-inversion attacks. However, attackers may not know what the model is used
for in practice. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method
to explore likely or similar domains of a target model -- the model domain
inference (MDI) attack. For a given target (classification) model, we assume
that the attacker knows nothing but the input and output formats and can use
the model to derive the prediction for any input in the desired form. Our basic
idea is to use the target model to affect a GAN training process for a
candidate domain's dataset that is easy to obtain. We find that the target
model may distract the training procedure less if the domain is more similar to
the target domain. We then measure the distraction level with the distance
between GAN-generated datasets, which can be used to rank candidate domains for
the target model. Our experiments show that the auxiliary dataset from an MDI
top-ranked domain can effectively boost the result of model-inversion attacks.

Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry which are warranted by the perturbative
finiteness of the chiral anomaly, thus being free of Gribov ambiguity. In
addition to the original argument using the unphysical gauge field component
collinear to the spatial derivative of the gauge function, we show the
unobservability of the topological charge using the Ward-Takahashi identity. We
then present the consequences of this finding and show the consistency with
many physical pictures and ideas that have been developed around the topology
of nonabelian gauge theory. The most important ones are the resolution of the
Strong CP problem, the unobservability of topological instantons, the physical
relevance of the axial $U(1)$ symmetry, the independence of the vacuum energy
on the vacuum angle, and the impossibility to realize the sphaleron induced
baryogenesis and chiral magnetic effects. The axial $U(1)$ symmetry and the
unphysical $\theta$-term imply that the physical complex phase of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is the sole source of CP violation in the
standard model. The unphysical sphaleron also means that the lepton number is
phenomenologically free from the baryon number, and their violations may be
modeled separately. We also comment on the consistency with the results of
lattice calculations.

photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, through changes in venous blood flow, heart

learning framework which is a based on a repurposed convolutional autoencoder.
Our model aims to encode all of the relevant respiratory information contained
within photoplethysmography waveform, and decode it into a waveform that is
similar to a gold standard respiratory reference. The model is employed on two
photoplethysmography data sets, namely Capnobase and BIDMC. We show that the
model is capable of producing respiratory waveforms that approach the gold
standard, while in turn producing state of the art respiratory rate estimates.
We also show that when it comes to capturing more advanced respiratory waveform
characteristics such as duty cycle, our model is for the most part
unsuccessful. A suggested reason for this, in light of a previous study on
in-ear PPG, is that the respiratory variations in finger-PPG are far weaker
compared with other recording locations. Importantly, our model can perform
these waveform estimates in a fraction of a millisecond, giving it the capacity
to produce over 6 hours of respiratory waveforms in a single second. Moreover,
we attempt to interpret the behaviour of the kernel weights within the model,
showing that in part our model intuitively selects different breathing
frequencies. The model proposed in this work could help to improve the

lead to catastrophic consequences, but accurate and accessible measurements
could improve patient outcomes. While blood tests provide accurate
measurements, they are invasive and the laboratory analysis can be slow or
inaccessible. In contrast, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely adopted tool
which is quick and simple to acquire. However, the problem of estimating
continuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not well-studied.
We therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for accurate
ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We explore the use
of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the regression
performance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset containing over
290000 ECGs. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from
continuous predictions to binary classification of extreme concentration
levels. To enhance clinical usefulness, we finally extend to a probabilistic
regression approach and evaluate different uncertainty estimates. Results: We
find that the performance varies significantly between different electrolytes,
which is clinically justified in the interplay of electrolytes and their
manifestation in the ECG. We also compare the regression accuracy with that of
traditional machine learning models, demonstrating superior performance of
DNNs. Conclusion: Discretization can lead to good classification performance,
but does not help solve the original problem of predicting continuous
concentration levels. While probabilistic regression demonstrates potential
practical usefulness, the uncertainty estimates are not particularly
well-calibrated. Significance: Our study is a first step towards accurate and
reliable ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentration levels.

evolution. This gap appears because stars with masses between 100 and 240
$M_\odot$ are expected to undergo a pair instability supernova and leave behind
no remnant, or a pulsational pair instability supernova and leave behind a
remnant much smaller than their initial stellar mass. However, black holes have
been discovered by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration within this mass range. In
previous work (arXiv:2010.00254), we used the stellar evolution code MESA to
show that the addition of non-nuclear energy (such as from annihilation of dark
matter) could alter the evolution of a 180 $M_\odot$ star so that the observed
black holes could be produced from isolated stars. In this paper, we extend
this analysis to stars of other masses, and find that sufficient amounts of
non-nuclear energy can allow any star to avoid pair instability, and could
produce a black hole of mass comparable to the initial stellar mass. In
addition, we produce examples of the type of black hole initial mass function
that can be produced from this mechanism. These illustrative examples suggest
that adding non-nuclear energy to stars offers a way to fully close the mass

contributes toward building automated emotion recognition systems that would

  feedback",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The field of artificial intelligence (AI) alignment aims to investigate
whether AI technologies align with human interests and values and function in a
safe and ethical manner. AI alignment is particularly relevant for large
language models (LLMs), which have the potential to exhibit unintended behavior
due to their ability to learn and adapt in ways that are difficult to predict.
In this paper, we discuss methodological challenges for the alignment problem
specifically in the context of LLMs trained to summarize texts. In particular,
we focus on methods for collecting reliable human feedback on summaries to
train a reward model which in turn improves the summarization model. We
conclude by suggesting specific improvements in the experimental design of
alignment studies for LLMs' summarization capabilities.

  wildlife-vehicle collisions by detecting and recognizing wildlife fences
  using deep learning and drone technology",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In South Africa, it is a common practice for people to leave their vehicles
beside the road when traveling long distances for a short comfort break. This
practice might increase human encounters with wildlife, threatening their
security and safety. Here we intend to create awareness about wildlife fencing,
using drone technology and computer vision algorithms to recognize and detect
wildlife fences and associated features. We collected data at Amakhala and
Lalibela private game reserves in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. We used
wildlife electric fence data containing single and double fences for the
classification task. Additionally, we used aerial and still annotated images
extracted from the drone and still cameras for the segmentation and detection
tasks. The model training results from the drone camera outperformed those from
the still camera. Generally, poor model performance is attributed to (1)
over-decompression of images and (2) the ability of drone cameras to capture
more details on images for the machine learning model to learn as compared to
still cameras that capture only the front view of the wildlife fence. We argue
that our model can be deployed on client-edge devices to inform people about
the presence and significance of wildlife fencing, which minimizes human
encounters with wildlife, thereby mitigating wildlife-vehicle collisions.

  media","12 pages","AIP Advances, Vol. 12, No. 12, id:125016 (2022)","10.1063/5.0132194",,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The paper aims to explore the physical quantities of several invariants,
including the basic postulates of some types of crucial coordinate
transformations, conservation laws and continuity equations, in the
electromagnetic and gravitational fields. J. C. Maxwell first utilized the
quaternions to describe the electromagnetic theory. Subsequent scholars make
use of the octonions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic and
gravitational fields simultaneously, including the octonion field strength,
field source, angular momentum, torque and force. When an octonion coordinate
system transforms rotationally, the scalar part of one octonion will remain
unchanged, although the vector part of the octonion may alter. In the octonion
space $\mathbb{O}$ , some invariants can be derived from this octonion
property. A part of these invariants can be selected as the basic postulates of
Galilean transformation or Lorentz transformation. Similarly, it is able to
derive several invariants from the octonion property, in the transformed
octonion space $\mathbb{O}_u$ . And that the invariants can be chosen as the
basic postulates of a few new types of coordinate transformations. Further, the
combination of invariants in the octonion spaces can be applied as the basic
postulates of some new coordinate transformations, relevant to the norm of
physical quantities. Through the analysis, it is easy to find that each
conserved quantity has its preconditions from the perspective of octonion
spaces. This is helpful to deepen the further understanding of the physical
properties of conservation laws and other invariants.
