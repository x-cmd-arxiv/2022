However, it fails when the wave nature of the heat propagation or time lags

in granular and porous materials including polysilicon, at extremely high

  In common materials the relaxation time ranges from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-14}$

amongst the reward distributions associated with the arms makes it challenging
to identify a subset of alternatives that guarantees the optimal collective
outcome. Thus, besides individual actions' reward, learning the causal
relations is essential to improve the decision-making strategy. To solve the
two-fold learning problem described above, we develop the 'combinatorial
semi-bandit framework with causally related rewards', where we model the causal
relations by a directed graph in a stationary structural equation model. The
nodal observation in the graph signal comprises the corresponding base arm's
instantaneous reward and an additional term resulting from the causal
influences of other base arms' rewards. The objective is to maximize the
long-term average payoff, which is a linear function of the base arms' rewards
and depends strongly on the network topology. To achieve this objective, we
propose a policy that determines the causal relations by learning the network's
topology and simultaneously exploits this knowledge to optimize the
decision-making process. We establish a sublinear regret bound for the proposed
algorithm. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to several
benchmarks.

signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in light detection and ranging (LiDAR). When

response time of the detector and suffers from jamming noise. Inspired by the
Zou-Wang-Mandel experiment, we design, construct and validate a quantum induced
coherence (QuIC) LiDAR which is inherently immune to ambient and jamming
noises. In traditional LiDAR the direct detection of the reflected probe
photons suffers from deteriorating SNR for increasing background noise. In QuIC
LiDAR we circumvent this obstacle by only detecting the entangled reference
photons, whose single-photon interference fringes are used to obtain the
distance of the object, while the reflected probe photons are used to erase
path information of the reference photons. In consequence, the noise
accompanying the reflected probe light has no effect on the detected signal. We
demonstrate such noise resilience with both LED and laser light to mimic the
background noise and jamming attack. The proposed method paves a new way of
battling noise in precise quantum electromagnetic sensing and ranging.

improving the urban transportation services. Enormous efforts have been made on
exploiting spatial correlations and temporal dependencies of traffic speed
evolving patterns by leveraging explicit spatial relations (geographical
proximity) through pre-defined geographical structures ({\it e.g.}, region
grids or road networks). While achieving promising results, current traffic
speed prediction methods still suffer from ignoring implicit spatial
correlations (interactions), which cannot be captured by grid/graph
convolutions. To tackle the challenge, we propose a generic model for enabling
the current traffic speed prediction methods to preserve implicit spatial
correlations. Specifically, we first develop a Dual-Transformer architecture,
including a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer. The Spatial
Transformer automatically learns the implicit spatial correlations across the
road segments beyond the boundary of geographical structures, while the
Temporal Transformer aims to capture the dynamic changing patterns of the
implicit spatial correlations. Then, to further integrate both explicit and
implicit spatial correlations, we propose a distillation-style learning
framework, in which the existing traffic speed prediction methods are
considered as the teacher model, and the proposed Dual-Transformer
architectures are considered as the student model. The extensive experiments
over three real-world datasets indicate significant improvements of our
proposed framework over the existing methods.

processes on $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ whose generators have this property,
although to simplify the calculations we only consider models with equal left
and right jumping rates. The classification leads to six familiar models and
three exceptional models. The generators of all but the exceptional models turn
out to belong to an infinite dimensional Hecke algebra, and the duality
functions appear as spanning vectors for small-dimensional irreducible
representations of this Hecke algebra. A second classification explores
generators built from two site operators satisfying the Hecke algebra
relations. The duality functions are intertwiners between configuration and
co-ordinate representations of Hecke algebras, which results in a novel
co-ordinate representations of the Hecke algebra. The standard Baxterisation
procedure leads to new solutions of the Young-Baxter equation corresponding to
particle systems which do not preserve the number of particles.

human health conditions, which can provide useful information for plenty of
practical purposes, such as health care, monitoring and re-identification. Most
existing methods of health indicator prediction mainly use front-view body or
face images. These inputs are hard to be obtained in daily life and often lead
to the lack of robustness for the models, considering their strict requirements
on view and pose. In this paper, we propose to employ gait videos to predict
health indicators, which are more prevalent in surveillance and home monitoring
scenarios. However, the study of health indicator prediction from gait videos
using deep learning was hindered due to the small amount of open-sourced data.
To address this issue, we analyse the similarity and relationship between pose
estimation and health indicator prediction tasks, and then propose a paradigm
enabling deep learning for small health indicator datasets by pre-training on
the pose estimation task. Furthermore, to better suit the health indicator
prediction task, we bring forward Global-Local Aware aNd Centrosymmetric

progressive convolutions and then fuses multi-level features by a
centrosymmetric double-path hourglass structure in two different ways.
  Experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm achieves state-of-the-art
results for predicting health indicators on MoVi, and that the GLANCE module is
also beneficial for pose estimation on 3DPW.

modified. This in turn, changes and modifies the expression for the intensity
observed far away from the black hole. Finally, we have obtained the shadow

quantum effect changes the background geometry, these effects are very small

in such nanostructures we develop here the superdiffusive theory for general
noncollinear magnetic multilayers. Specifically, we introduce an Al/Ni/Ru/Fe/Ru
multilayer system with noncollinear Ni and Fe magnetic moments and analyze how
the ultrafast demagnetization and spin-transfer torque depend on the
noncollinearity. We employ ab initio calculations to compute the spin- and
energy-dependent transmissions of hot electrons at the interfaces of the
multilayer. Taking into account multiple electron scattering at interfaces and
spin mixing in the spacer layer we find that the laser-induced demagnetization
of the Ni layer and magnetization change of the Fe layer strongly depend on the
angle between their magnetizations. Similarly, the spin-transfer torques on the
Ni and Fe layers and the total spin momentum absorbed in the Ni and Fe layer
are found to vary markedly with the amount of noncollinearity.
  These results suggest that changing the amount of noncollinearity in magnetic

strategy to boost the bandwidth of integrated optical transceivers.
State-of-the-art multiplexers require accurate control of the relative phase or
the spatial distribution among different guided optical modes, seriously
compromising the bandwidth and performance of the devices. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a new approach based on the coupling between guided
modes in integrated waveguides and optical beams free-propagating on the chip
plane. The engineering of the evanescent coupling between the guided modes and
free-propagating beams allows spatial and polarization multiplexing with
state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the potential and versatility of
this approach, we have developed a two-polarization multiplexed link and a
three-mode multiplexed link using standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator
technology. The two-polarization link shows a measured -35 dB crosstalk
bandwidth of 180 nm, while the three-mode link exhibits a -20 dB crosstalk
bandwidth of 195 nm. These bandwidths cover the S, C, L, and U communication
bands. We used these links to demonstrate error-free transmission
(bit-error-rate < 10-9) of two and three non-return-to-zero signals at 40 Gbps
each, with power penalties below 0.08 dB and 1.5 dB for the two-polarization
and three-mode links respectively. The approach demonstrated here for two
polarizations and three modes is also applicable to future implementation of
more complex multiplexing schemes.

distinctions between two tasks that have been frequently overlooked: (i) edges
only constitute the topology in the node classification task but can be used as
both the topology and the supervisions (i.e., labels) in the edge prediction
task; (ii) the node classification makes prediction over each individual node,
while the edge prediction is determinated by each pair of nodes. To this end,
we propose a novel edge prediction paradigm named Edge-aware Message PassIng
neuRal nEtworks (EMPIRE). Concretely, we first introduce an edge splitting
technique to specify use of each edge where each edge is solely used as either
the topology or the supervision (named as topology edge or supervision edge).
We then develop a new message passing mechanism that generates the messages to
source nodes (through topology edges) being aware of target nodes (through
supervision edges). In order to emphasize the differences between pairs
connected by supervision edges and pairs unconnected, we further weight the
messages to highlight the relative ones that can reflect the differences. In
addition, we design a novel negative node-pair sampling trick that efficiently
samples 'hard' negative instances in the supervision instances, and can
significantly improve the performance. Experimental results verify that the
proposed method can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models
regarding the edge prediction task on multiple homogeneous and heterogeneous
graph datasets.

these optical mirages vanish when the illumination comes from a spinless beam

generalization ability of vision transformers (ViTs). However, the
inconsistency between the mixed images and the corresponding labels harms its
efficacy. Existing CutMix variants tackle this problem by generating more
consistent mixed images or more precise mixed labels, but inevitably introduce
heavy training overhead or require extra information, undermining ease of use.
To this end, we propose an novel and effective Self-Motivated image Mixing
method (SMMix), which motivates both image and label enhancement by the model
under training itself. Specifically, we propose a max-min attention region
mixing approach that enriches the attention-focused objects in the mixed

co-trains the output tokens of mixed images with fine-grained supervision.
Moreover, we devise a novel feature consistency constraint to align features
from mixed and unmixed images. Due to the subtle designs of the self-motivated
paradigm, our SMMix is significant in its smaller training overhead and better
performance than other CutMix variants. In particular, SMMix improves the
accuracy of DeiT-T/S/B, CaiT-XXS-24/36, and PVT-T/S/M/L by more than +1% on

Unfortunately, most existing algorithms cannot be guaranteed to converge
globally and even suffer from limit cycles. To address this issue, we propose a
novel single-loop algorithm called doubly smoothed gradient descent ascent
method (DSGDA), which naturally balances the primal and dual updates. The
proposed DSGDA can get rid of limit cycles in various challenging
nonconvex-nonconcave examples in the literature, including Forsaken,
Bilinearly-coupled minimax, Sixth-order polynomial, and PolarGame. We further
show that under an one-sided Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz condition with exponent
$\theta\in(0,1)$ (resp. convex primal/concave dual function), DSGDA can find a
game-stationary point with an iteration complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2\max\{2\theta,1\}})$ (resp.
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$). These match the best results for single-loop
algorithms that solve nonconvex-concave or convex-nonconcave minimax problems,
or problems satisfying the rather restrictive one-sided Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz
condition. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the possibility of having

servers, but the users don't want any of the servers to get any information
about their demand. The user caches are filled with some arbitrary function of
the files before the users decide their demands, known as the placement phase.
After deciding their demands, users cooperatively send queries to the servers
to retrieve their desired files privately. Upon receiving the queries, servers
broadcast coded transmissions which are a function of the queries they received
and the files, known as the delivery phase. Conveying queries to the servers
incurs an upload cost for the users, and downloading the answers broadcasted by
the servers incurs a download cost. To implement cache-aided MuPIR schemes,
each file has to be split into $F$ packets. In this paper, we propose MuPIR
schemes that utilize placement delivery arrays (PDAs) to characterize placement
and delivery. Proposed MuPIR schemes significantly reduce subpacketization
levels while slightly increasing the download cost. The proposed scheme also
substantially reduces the upload cost for the users. For PDAs based on {\it

generating high-quality image samples. Recently, diffusion autoencoders
(Diff-AE) have been proposed to explore DPMs for representation learning via
autoencoding. Their key idea is to jointly train an encoder for discovering
meaningful representations from images and a conditional DPM as the decoder for
reconstructing images. Considering that training DPMs from scratch will take a
long time and there have existed numerous pre-trained DPMs, we propose
\textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{D}PM \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoding
(\textbf{PDAE}), a general method to adapt existing pre-trained DPMs to the
decoders for image reconstruction, with better training efficiency and
performance than Diff-AE. Specifically, we find that the reason that
pre-trained DPMs fail to reconstruct an image from its latent variables is due
to the information loss of forward process, which causes a gap between their
predicted posterior mean and the true one. From this perspective, the
classifier-guided sampling method can be explained as computing an extra mean
shift to fill the gap, reconstructing the lost class information in samples.
These imply that the gap corresponds to the lost information of the image, and
we can reconstruct the image by filling the gap. Drawing inspiration from this,
we employ a trainable model to predict a mean shift according to encoded
representation and train it to fill as much gap as possible, in this way, the
encoder is forced to learn as much information as possible from images to help
the filling. By reusing a part of network of pre-trained DPMs and redesigning
the weighting scheme of diffusion loss, PDAE can learn meaningful
representations from images efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility of PDAE.

wavefunctions of integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, there have still

constructed from nonunitary conformal field theories (CFTs), such as Gaffiinian

bulk-edge correspondence in the cylinder geometry. Contrary to the common
understandings of the condensed matter communities, the gaplessness for these

CFTs in this setting at least directly. We propose the difficulty is coming
from the mismatch of monodromy charge and simple charge of underlying CFTs,
known as Galois shuffle. In the Haldane-Rezayi state, this corresponds to the
conjugate operation of the Neveu-Schwartz and Ramond sectors for unitary Weyl
fermion and symplectic fermion. In the Gaffinian state, besides Galois shuffle
structure, the anomalous conformal dimension of the $Z_{2}$ simple current
results in the cylinder partition functions outside of the existing local
quantum field theory. This indicates the existing gapless fractional quantum
Hall states have similar nonlocal structures, similar to deconfined quantum
criticality. Our work opens up a new paradigm which gives a criterion to
predict whether the candidate of topological ordered states are gapped or not,
and local or nonlocal, by revisiting the problem of anomaly and the duality of
symplectic and Dirac fermion.

  sprays subjected to moderately turbulent co-flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Separate and joint droplets, clusters, and voids characteristics of sprays
injected in a turbulent co-flow are investigated experimentally. Simultaneous
Mie scattering and Interferometric Laser Imaging for Droplet Sizing along with
separate hotwire anemometry are performed. The turbulent co-flow
characteristics are adjusted using zero, one, or two perforated plates. The
Taylor length scale-based Reynolds number varies from 10 to 38, and the Stokes
number estimated based on the Kolmogorov time scale varies from 3 to 25. The
results show that the mean length scale of the clusters normalized by the
Kolmogorov length scale varies linearly with the Stokes number. However, the
mean void length scale is on the order of the integral length scale. It is
shown that the number density of the droplets inside the clusters is about 10
times larger than that in the voids. The ratios of the droplets number
densities in the clusters and voids to the total number density are independent
of the test conditions and equal 8.3 and 0.7, respectively. The joint
probability density function of the droplets diameter and clusters area shows
that the droplets with the most probable diameter are found in the majority of
the clusters. It is argued that intensifying the turbulence broadens the range
of turbulent eddy size in the co-flow which allows for accommodating droplets
with a broad range of diameters in the clusters. The results are of
significance for engineering applications that aim to modify the clustering
characteristics of large Stokes number droplets sprayed into turbulent

RAPs must be resolved as it is an imperative and challenging issue. This paper
proposes a deterministic method for blindly estimating STI and five RAPs on the
basis of an RIR stochastic model that approximates an unknown RIR. The proposed
method formulates a temporal power envelope of a reverberant speech signal to
obtain the optimal parameters for the RIR model. Simulations were conducted to
evaluate STI and RAPs from observed reverberant speech signals. The
root-mean-square errors between the estimated and ground-truth results were
used to comparatively evaluate the proposed method with the previous method.
The results showed that the proposed method can estimate STI and RAPs

subsurface metal bars of small diameters remains a challenging problem for the
existing reflection pattern-based method due to the limited resolution of GPR.
To address the issue, we propose a reflection power-based method by exploring
the relationship between the bar diameter and the maximum power of the bar
reflected signal obtained by a wideband dual-polarized GPR, which circumvents
the resolution limit of the existing pattern-based method. In the proposed
method, the theoretical relationship between the bar diameter and the power
ratio of the bar reflected signals acquired by perpendicular and parallel
polarized antennas is established via the inherent scattering width of the
metal bar and the wideband spectrum of the bar reflected signal. Based on the
theoretical relationship, the bar diameter can be estimated using the obtained
power ratio in a GPR survey. Simulations and experiments have been conducted
with different GPR frequency spectra, subsurface mediums, and metal bars of
various diameters and depths to demonstrate the efficacy of the method.
Experimental results show that the method achieves high sizing accuracy with
errors of less than 10% in different scenarios. With its simple operation and
high accuracy, the method can be implemented in real-time in situ examination
of subsurface metal bars.

same sentence, to better exploit the backbone's power, a sentence embedding
consistency constraint is imposed between the visual and sequential modules to
enhance the representation power of both features. We name the CSLR model
trained with the above auxiliary tasks as consistency-enhanced CSLR, which
performs well on signer-dependent datasets in which all signers appear during
both training and testing. To make it more robust for the signer-independent
setting, a signer removal module based on feature disentanglement is further
proposed to remove signer information from the backbone. Extensive ablation
studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of these auxiliary tasks.
More remarkably, with a transformer-based backbone, our model achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance on five benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014-T, PHOENIX-2014-SI, CSL, and CSL-Daily.

investigate environmental effects on the mass accretion rate onto protostars.
As the initial state, we neglect the magnetic field and cloud rotation, and
adopt star-forming cores composed of two parts: a centrally condensed core and
an outer envelope. The inner core has a critical Bonnor-Ebert density profile
and is enclosed by the outer envelope. We prepare 15 star-forming cores with
different outer envelope densities and gravitational radii, within which the
gas flows into the collapsing core, and calculate their evolution until $\sim 2
\times10^5$ yr after protostar formation. The mass accretion rate decreases as
the core is depleted when the outer envelope density is low. In contrast, the
mass accretion rate is temporarily enhanced when the outer envelope density is
high and the resultant protostellar mass exceeds the initial mass of the
centrally condensed core. Some recent observations indicate that the mass of
prestellar cores is too small to reproduce the stellar mass distribution. Our
simulations show that the mass inflow from outside the core contributes greatly
to protostellar mass growth when the core is embedded in a high-density
envelope, which could explain the recent observations.

show that both the cortical thickness network and the surface area network in

clustering coefficients and low characteristic path lengths. At certain network
sparsity levels, both the cortical thickness network and the surface area
network of FES have significantly lower clustering coefficients and local

that stealth configurations cannot be realized as exact solutions but those

be considered as stealth at astrophysical scales for all practical purposes

the representation theorem of continuous t-norms is used to obtain the

various aggregation operators, namely the IF weighted average (IFWA), IF

(I) probes that helps resolve accurately voltage-current phase differences even
when the difference is very close to $90^{\circ}$. The latter has been a major
issue with V-I probes when used with miniature RF plasma devices like the
atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). Since the impedance of such miniature
devices is predominantly capacitive, the phase difference between the voltage
and current signals is very nearly $90^{\circ}$. It turns out, however, that
when V-I probes are used with such devices without joint calibration, these
frequently yield phase shifts over $90^{\circ}$. Also, since power absorption
is proportional to the resistive part of the impedance it becomes very
sensitive to the phase difference when it is close to $\approx90^{\circ}$.
Thus, it is important to be able to resolve the phases accurately.
Post-calibration, V-I probes would be indispensable for the electrical
characterization of APPJs for determining average RF power $P_{av}$, plasma
impedance $Z_p$, etc.Typical post-calibration V-I data yields, $Zp \approx 93.6

algorithms are also adjusted, using the gray wolf algorithm. This framework was
evaluated using a real dataset made up of 2816 patients from the Imam Ali
Kermanshah Hospital in Iran. The study's findings indicate that low Ejection
Fraction, old age, high CPK values, and high Creatinine levels are the main
contributors to patients' mortality. Several significant and interesting rules
related to mortality in hospitals and length of stay have also been extracted
and presented. Additionally, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and auroc

the SVM classifier were 0.9961, 0.9477, 0.9992, and 0.9734, respectively.

under study enriched by the hairy Horndeski parameter $h$, in addition to the
mass $M$ and spin $a$, we compute the amplification factor of scalar wave
scattering indicating the energy extraction from the BH. We find that due to
the addition of the hairy parameter $h$ in the geometry, the superradiance
scattering and its frequency range enhance compared to the Kerr BH. This
implies that Horndeski's gravity belongs to those alternative theories of
gravity that make the amplification factor larger than the Kerr BH so that the
energy extraction in its framework is more efficient than general relativity.
Calculating the outgoing energy flux measured by an observer at infinity
verifies the role of the hairy parameter $h$ in the increase of energy
extraction efficiency from the rotating BH. By implementing the BH bomb
mechanism, we present an analysis of the superradiant instability of the
underlying BH spacetime against massive scalar fields. Our analysis indicates
that the hairy Horndeski parameter leaves no imprint on the standard

Our findings are illustrated in the paradigmatic example provided by an optical

translational symmetry along all directions, and impacts the system in a
qualitatively unexpected manner: three-dimensional solitons, or light-bullets,
are the only existing and stable states for a given set of parameters. This
property is extremely rare, if not unknown, in passive nonlinear physical
systems. As a result, the excitation of the cavity with any input field leads
to the deterministic formation of a target soliton or breather, with a
spatiotemporal profile that unambiguously corresponds to the given cavity and
pumping conditions. In addition, the tuning of the potential width along the
temporal direction results in the existence of a plethora of stable asymmetric
solitons. Our results may provide a solid route towards the observation of

radiation spectrum, the Lorentz factor of jets corresponding to different

technologies as enablers for workplace innovation. One emerging technology to
potentially remedy drawbacks of remote work arrangements are meta-verses that
merge physical reality with digital virtuality. In the literature, such
innovations in the knowledge work sector have been primarily examined against
the backdrop of collaboration as a dependent variable. In this paper, however,
we investigate knowledge work in metaverses from a distraction-conflict
perspective because independent, uninterrupted activities are as much
characteristic of knowledge work as collaboration. Preliminary findings show
that knowledge workers in meta-verses experience arousal from the 1) presence,
appearance, and behaviour of other avatars, 2) realism, novelty, and
affordances of the virtual environment, and 3) technological friction and
navigation. This work has the theoretical implication that distraction-conflict
theory must be extended to incorporate additional sources of arousal when
applied to the context of knowledge work in metaverses.

from 50 Hz- 10 kHz on the helium RF atmospheric pressure plasma jet's
fundamental characteristics. The impact of modulation frequency on plasma jet
discharge behavior, geometrical variation, reactive species emission, and
plasma parameters (gas temperature Tg, electron excitation temperature Texc,
and electron density (ne) are studied using various diagnostics such as optical
imaging, emission spectra, and thermal diagnostics. From the experiments, it is
observed that operating the plasma jet at low pulse modulation frequencies
(around 50 Hz) provides enhanced plasma dimensions, higher electron densities
and greater optical emission from reactive species (viz., He I, O, OH, N2+,
etc.) as compared to the higher modulation frequencies. Besides the low power
consumption, the three times less gas temperature of the modulated plasma jet
than the continuous wave mode makes it more advantageous for the applications.
Moreover, the influence of duty cycle (D) and applied RF power (P) on the
plasma jet characteristics are also discussed. It is found that 10- 40% duty
cycle operation provides the most favorable attributes. More importantly, the
concern of shorter plasma length in RF plasma jets is overcome by operating at
10- 20% duty cycle with increased applied power. This work thoroughly
characterizes helium atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet with a wide range of
pulse mode operating parameters, which could help select appropriate operating
conditions for various industrial and biomedical applications.

emissions emerge - a phenomenon known as transition radiation. Being paramount
to fundamental physics, transition radiation has enabled many applications from
high-energy particle identification to novel light sources. A rule of thumb in
transition radiation is that the radiation intensity generally decreases with
the particle velocity v; as a result, low-energy particles are not favored in
practice. Here we find that there exist situations where transition radiation
from particles with extremely low velocities (e.g. v/c<0.001) exhibits
comparable intensity as that from high-energy particles (e.g. v/c=0.999), where
c is light speed in free space. The comparable radiation intensity implies an
extremely high photon extraction efficiency from low-energy particles, up to
eight orders of magnitude larger than that from high-energy particles. This
exotic phenomenon of low-velocity-favored transition radiation originates from
the excitation of Ferrell-Berreman modes in epsilon-near-zero materials. Our
findings may provide a promising route towards the design of integrated light
sources based on low-energy electrons and specialized detectors for

focus more on important locations through global image matching after
successfully inserting Transformer into the generative adversarial network for

and federated learning. Differential privacy adds noise to the client outputs
and thus deteriorates the quality of each iteration. This distributed setting
adds a layer of complexity and additional communication and performance
overhead. These costs are additive per round, so we need to reduce the number
of iterations. In this work, we provide an analytical framework for studying
the convergence guarantees of gradient-based distributed algorithms. We show
that our private algorithm minimizes the expected gradient variance by
approximately $d^2$ rounds, where d is the dimensionality of the model. We

environmental contaminants, which are highly recalcitrant and toxic in nature.
Currently, no suitable rectification methods are available against the ECs,
resulting in a continuous increase in their concentration. Non-thermal plasma,
as an advanced oxidation process, has been emerging as a promising technology
against the ECs treatment. In the present work, a detailed experimental study
is carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a non-thermal plasma jet with two
dyes, Rhodamine B and Methylene Blue, as model contaminants. The plasma jet
provided a complete dye decoloration in 30 min with an applied voltage of 6.5
kV. .OH, having the highest oxidation potential, acts as the main reactive
species, which with direct action on contaminants also acts indirectly by
getting converted into H2O2 and O3. Further, the effect of critical operational
parameters viz., sample pH, applied voltage (4.5-6.5 kV), conductivity (5-20
mScm-1), and sample distance on plasma treatment efficacy was also examined.
Out of all the assessed parameters, the applied voltage and sample conductivity

language interfaces to data, which provide an easy mechanism for non-technical
users to access and query the data. While early systems evolved from keyword
search and focused on simple factual queries, the complexity of both the input
sentences as well as the generated SQL queries has evolved over time. More
recently, there has also been a lot of focus on using conversational interfaces
for data analytics, empowering a line of non-technical users with quick
insights into the data. There are three main challenges in natural language
querying (NLQ): (1) identifying the entities involved in the user utterance,
(2) connecting the different entities in a meaningful way over the underlying
data source to interpret user intents, and (3) generating a structured query in
the form of SQL or SPARQL.
  There are two main approaches for interpreting a user's NLQ. Rule-based
systems make use of semantic indices, ontologies, and KGs to identify the
entities in the query, understand the intended relationships between those
entities, and utilize grammars to generate the target queries. With the
advances in deep learning (DL)-based language models, there have been many
text-to-SQL approaches that try to interpret the query holistically using DL
models. Hybrid approaches that utilize both rule-based techniques as well as DL
models are also emerging by combining the strengths of both approaches.
Conversational interfaces are the next natural step to one-shot NLQ by
exploiting query context between multiple turns of conversation for
disambiguation. In this article, we review the background technologies that are
used in natural language interfaces, and survey the different approaches to
NLQ. We also describe conversational interfaces for data analytics and discuss
several benchmarks used for NLQ research and evaluation.

relaxation of a molecular spin in weak interaction with a thermal bath for the

where the transition from coherent to incoherent relaxation occurs, we find
that the slowest relaxation mode shows a first-order phase transition.
Associated with this transition, an unusual non-monotonic
temperature-dependence of the relaxation rate of this mode is also
demonstrated. Contrary to the popular belief, this non-monotony gives rise to a
peculiar but observable behavior where increasing temperature will not only
result in a smaller rate of the slowest relaxation mode but also may lead to a
slower decaying of the magnetization after some relaxing time. Additionally, it
is also shown that magnetization relaxation in this intermediate temperature
domain can only be accurately described by a bi- or tri-exponential form. The
physical reason underlying these features can be attributed to the role of the
quantum tunneling effect and different but comparative relaxation modes. A
simple experiment to confirm our findings on the first-order phase transition

focused on capturing behavioral similarities between state representations or
applying data augmentation on visual observations. In this paper, we propose a
novel meta-learner-based framework for representation learning regarding
behavioral similarities for reinforcement learning. Specifically, our framework
encodes the high-dimensional observations into two decomposed embeddings
regarding reward and dynamics in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A pair of
meta-learners are developed, one of which quantifies the reward similarity and
the other quantifies dynamics similarity over the correspondingly decomposed
embeddings. The meta-learners are self-learned to update the state embeddings
by approximating two disjoint terms in on-policy bisimulation metric. To
incorporate the reward and dynamics terms, we further develop a strategy to
adaptively balance their impacts based on different tasks or environments. We
empirically demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms

  effective worldline theory","29 Pages, 1 figure, 2 tables",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084006",,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The mass and spin of black holes (BHs) in binary systems may change due to
the infall of gravitational-wave (GW) energy down the horizons. For spinning
BHs, this effect enters at 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order relative to the
leading-order energy flux at infinity. There is currently a discrepancy in the
literature in the expressions of these horizon fluxes in the test-body limit at
4PN order (relative 1.5PN order). Here, we model the horizon absorption as
tidal heating in an effective worldline theory of a spinning particle equipped
with tidally-induced quadrupole and octupole moments. We match the tidal
response to analytic solutions of the Teukolsky equation in a scattering
scenario, and obtain general formulae for the evolution of mass and spin. We
then specialize to the case of aligned-spin--quasi-circular binaries, obtaining
the corresponding contributions to the GW phasing through 4PN order.
Importantly, we find that the number of GW cycles due to horizon fluxes with
masses observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors is about 2-3 orders of magnitude
smaller than the other contributions to the phasing at the same PN order.
Furthermore, in the test-body limit, we find full agreement with results
obtained earlier from BH perturbation theory, with a small mass in an
equatorial circular orbit treated as a source perturbing the Kerr metric. Thus,
we weigh in on one side of the previous discrepancy.

  Reducing deformation barrier via localized excess electrons as mobile anions","24 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under hydrostatic pressure, alpha-quartz undergoes solid-state mechanical
amorphization wherein the interpenetration of SiO4 tetrahedra occurs and the
material loses crystallinity. This phase transformation requires a high
hydrostatic pressure of 14 GPa because the repulsive forces resulting from the
ionic nature of the Si-O bonds prevent the severe distortion of the atomic
configuration. Herein, we experimentally and computationally demonstrate that
e-beam irradiation changes the nature of the interatomic bonds in alpha-quartz
and enhances the solid-state mechanical amorphization at nanoscale.
Specifically, during in situ uniaxial compression, a larger permanent
deformation occurs in alpha-quartz micropillars compressed during e-beam
irradiation than in those without e-beam irradiation. Microstructural analysis
reveals that the large permanent deformation under e-beam irradiation
originates from the enhanced mechanical amorphization of alpha-quartz and the
subsequent viscoplastic deformation of the amorphized region. Further,
atomic-scale simulations suggest that the delocalized excess electrons
introduced by e-beam irradiation move to highly distorted atomic configurations
and alleviate the repulsive force, thus reducing the barrier to the solid-state
mechanical amorphization. These findings deepen our understanding of
electron-matter interactions and can be extended to new glass forming and
processing technologies at nano- and microscale.

(ANNs) belong nowadays to the most heavily employed computational schemes in
the digital world. Despite the compelling success of such methods, it remains
an open problem to provide a rigorous theoretical justification for the success
of GD methods in the training of ANNs. The main difficulty is that the
optimization risk landscapes associated to ANNs usually admit many non-optimal
critical points (saddle points as well as non-global local minima) whose risk
values are strictly larger than the optimal risk value. It is a key
contribution of this article to overcome this obstacle in certain simplified
shallow ANN training situations. In such simplified ANN training scenarios we
prove that the gradient flow (GF) dynamics with only one random initialization
overcomes with high probability all bad non-global local minima (all non-global
local minima whose risk values are much larger than the risk value of the
global minima) and converges with high probability to a good critical point (a
critical point whose risk value is very close to the optimal risk value of the
global minima). This analysis allows us to establish convergence in probability
to zero of the risk value of the GF trajectories with convergence rates as the
ANN training time and the width of the ANN increase to infinity. We complement
the analytical findings of this work with extensive numerical simulations for
shallow and deep ANNs: All these numerical simulations strongly suggest that
with high probability the considered GD method (stochastic GD or Adam)
overcomes all bad non-global local minima, does not converge to a global
minimum, but does converge to a good non-optimal critical point whose risk

bright neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2 simultaneously observed by
IXPE, NICER and INTEGRAL. Consistently with previous results, the broad-band
spectrum is characterized by a lower-energy component, attributed to the
accretion disc with $kT_{\rm in} \approx$ 1 keV, plus unsaturated
Comptonization in thermal plasma with temperature $kT_{\rm e} = 3$ keV and
optical depth $\tau \approx 4$, assuming a slab geometry. We measure the
polarization degree in the 2-8 keV band $P=1.8 \pm 0.3$ per cent and
polarization angle $\phi = 140^{\circ} \pm 4^{\circ}$, consistent with the
previous X-ray polarimetric measurements by OSO-8 as well as with the direction
of the radio jet which was earlier observed from the source. While polarization
of the disc spectral component is poorly constrained with the IXPE data, the
Comptonized emission has a polarization degree $P =4.0 \pm 0.7$ per cent and a
polarization angle aligned with the radio jet. Our results strongly favour a
spreading layer at the neutron star surface as the main source of the

a probabilistic activity driven (PAD) model that could generate temporal
higher-order networks with both power-law and high-clustering characteristics,
which successfully links the two most critical structural features and a basic
dynamical pattern in extensive complex systems. Surprisingly, the power-law
exponents and the clustering coefficients of the aggregated PAD network could
be tuned in a wide range by altering a set of model parameters. We further
provide an approximation algorithm to select the proper parameters that can
generate networks with given structural properties, the effectiveness of which
is verified by fitting various real-world networks. Lastly, we explore the
co-evolution of PAD model and higher-order contagion dynamics, and analytically
derive the critical conditions for phase transition and bistable phenomenon.
Our model provides a basic tool to reproduce complex structural properties and
to study the widespread higher-order dynamics, which has great potential for
applications across fields.

presents an Objectness Activation Network (OAN) to help detectors focus on

enabling a simple and effective solution to object detection in large images.
In brief, OAN is a light fully-convolutional network for judging whether each

  Functions",,,,,"econ.EM stat.ME stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In various fields of data science, researchers are often interested in
estimating the ratio of conditional expectation functions (CEFR). Specifically
in causal inference problems, it is sometimes natural to consider ratio-based
treatment effects, such as odds ratios and hazard ratios, and even
difference-based treatment effects are identified as CEFR in some empirically
relevant settings. This chapter develops the general framework for estimation
and inference on CEFR, which allows the use of flexible machine learning for
infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. In the first stage of the framework,
the orthogonal signals are constructed using debiased machine learning
techniques to mitigate the negative impacts of the regularization bias in the
nuisance estimates on the target estimates. The signals are then combined with
a novel series estimator tailored for CEFR. We derive the pointwise and uniform
asymptotic results for estimation and inference on CEFR, including the validity
of the Gaussian bootstrap, and provide low-level sufficient conditions to apply
the proposed framework to some specific examples. We demonstrate the
finite-sample performance of the series estimator constructed under the
proposed framework by numerical simulations. Finally, we apply the proposed
method to estimate the causal effect of the 401(k) program on household assets.

$S_8=0.820\pm 0.011$, and thus the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to
$1.28\sigma$ and $2.67\sigma$, respectively. However, in this case the
$\tilde\Lambda$CDM model is not favored by the data, compared with
$\Lambda$CDM. We find that when the $H_0$ and $S_8$ data are added into the

which relieves the $H_0$ tension to $0.53\sigma$, and in this case the model is
favored over $\Lambda$CDM. In the CBS+$H_0$+$S_8$ case, we get a synthetically
best situation, $H_0=71.9\pm 1.1$ ${\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8=0.8071\pm

duration and extremely high brightness temperature. Very recently, some highly
circularly polarized bursts were found in a repeater, FRB 20201124A. The
significant circular polarization might be produced by coherent curvature
radiation by bunches with the line of sight (LOS) deviating from the bunch
central trajectories. In this work, we carry out simulations to study the
statistical properties of burst polarization within the framework of coherent
curvature radiation by charged bunches in the neutron star magnetosphere for
repeating FRBs. The flux is almost constant within the opening angle of the
bunch. However, when the LOS derivates from the bunch opening angle, the larger
the derivation, the larger the circular polarization but the lower the flux. We
investigate the statistical distribution of circular polarization and flux of
radio bursts from an FRB repeater, and find that most of the bursts with high
circular polarization have a relatively low flux. Besides, we find that most of
the depolarization degrees of bursts have a small variation in a wide frequency
band. Furthermore, we simulate the polarization angle (PA) evolution and find
that most bursts show a flat PA evolution within the burst phases, and some
bursts present a swing of PA.

of expansion -- vertex expansion, edge expansion, and spectral expansion -- are
all equivalent. In this paper, we study to what extent such a statement is true
for linear-algebraic notions of expansion.
  There are two well-studied notions of linear-algebraic expansion, namely
dimension expansion (defined in analogy to graph vertex expansion) and quantum
expansion (defined in analogy to graph spectral expansion). Lubotzky and
Zelmanov proved that the latter implies the former. We prove that the converse
is false: there are dimension expanders which are not quantum expanders.
  Moreover, this asymmetry is explained by the fact that there are two distinct
linear-algebraic analogues of graph edge expansion. The first of these is
quantum edge expansion, which was introduced by Hastings, and which he proved
to be equivalent to quantum expansion. We introduce a new notion, termed
dimension edge expansion, which we prove is equivalent to dimension expansion
and which is implied by quantum edge expansion. Thus, the separation above is
implied by a finer one: dimension edge expansion is strictly weaker than
quantum edge expansion. This new notion also leads to a new, more modular proof
of the Lubotzky--Zelmanov result that quantum expanders are dimension
expanders.

quantum mechanics has recently emerged, but its physical implications regarding
the retrodiction of a quantum observable remain controversial. To address the
controversy, here I offer operational meanings for a version of the GCEs in the
context of quantum parameter estimation. When a quantum sensor is corrupted by
decoherence, the GCE is found to relate the operator-valued optimal estimators
before and after the decoherence. Furthermore, the error increase, or regret,
caused by the decoherence is shown to be equal to a divergence between the two
estimators. The real weak value as a special case of the GCE plays the same
role in suboptimal estimation -- its divergence from the optimal estimator is
precisely the regret for not using the optimal measurement. For an application
of the GCE, I show that it enables the use of dynamic programming for designing
a controller that minimizes the estimation error. For the frequentist setting,
I show that the GCE leads to a quantum Rao-Blackwell theorem, which offers
significant implications for quantum metrology and thermal-light sensing in
particular. These results give the GCE and the associated divergence a natural,
useful, and incontrovertible role in quantum decision and control theory.

Hereby, in this paper, we carefully analyze the characteristics of metal

to adapt the physical prior structures of artifacts, i.e., rotationally
symmetrical streaking patterns. The proposed method rationally adopts
Fourier-series-expansion-based filter parametrization in artifact modeling,
which can better separate artifacts from anatomical tissues and boost the model

help them to determine their position and calmly stick to it without entering
into an unnecessary debate with promoters of `decolonisation of the curricula'.
The paper offers a simple and honest defence against `decolonisation'
pressures: tell students the real (pre)history of a particular mathematical
discipline. Let us call this activity `historical enrichment'.
  It would be useful if all attempts at `decolonization' (and vice versa,
`historical enrichment') were known to a wider circle of the mathematical
community. Publicity and an open discussion are the best way to resist outside
pressures to engage in virtue signalling at the expense of historical and

$^8$B$(p,\gamma)$$^9$C astrophysical factors, all E1, M1, and E2 transitions
from the initial continuum states to the final bound states ${3/2}_1^-$of $^9$C
are considered. The resonant capture to the first resonant state ${1/2}_1^-$ of

emission threshold in $^9$C are reproduced by the GSM-CC. The calculated
astrophysical factors agrees with the existed experimental data from the

capture are calculated for the temperature range of astrophysical interest. The
calculated total astrophysical $S$ factor is dominated by the E1 transition to
the ground state of $^9$C. The GSM-CC calculations suggest that $S$ first
increase with the energy of the center of mass $E_{\rm c.m.}$, and then

The crustal-type material of group A would possibly require the stripping of

we hypothesize that training can be enhanced by assigning different importance

non-uniform sampling. Combining the proposed method with prioritization methods
improves sampling efficiency while increasing the performance of TD-based
off-policy RL algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated by experiments in six environments of the OpenAI Gym suite. The

individual status and how it moves between two thresholds: the current income
and the desired income. Yet, our knowledge of these temporal properties of
income remains limited since we rely on estimates coming from transition
matrices which simplify income dynamics by aggregating the individual changes
into quantiles and thus overlooking significant microscopic variations. Here,
we bridge this gap by employing First Passage Time concepts in a baseline
stochastic process with resetting used for modeling income dynamics and
developing a framework that is able to crucially disaggregate the temporal
properties of income to the level of an individual worker. We find analytically
and illustrate numerically that our framework is orthogonal to the transition

facilitate empirical applications of the framework, we introduce a publicly

tasks. However, due to the huge computational complexity and storage
requirements, it is challenging to apply the large-scale model to real scenes.
A common solution is knowledge distillation which regards the large-scale model
as a teacher model and helps to train a small student model to obtain a
competitive performance. Cross-task Knowledge distillation expands the
application scenarios of the large-scale pre-trained model. Existing knowledge
distillation works focus on directly mimicking the final prediction or the
intermediate layers of the teacher model, which represent the global-level
characteristics and are task-specific. To alleviate the constraint of different
label spaces, capturing invariant intrinsic local object characteristics (such
as the shape characteristics of the leg and tail of the cattle and horse) plays
a key role. Considering the complexity and variability of real scene tasks, we
propose a Prototype-guided Cross-task Knowledge Distillation (ProC-KD) approach
to transfer the intrinsic local-level object knowledge of a large-scale teacher
network to various task scenarios. First, to better transfer the generalized
knowledge in the teacher model in cross-task scenarios, we propose a prototype
learning module to learn from the essential feature representation of objects
in the teacher model. Secondly, for diverse downstream tasks, we propose a
task-adaptive feature augmentation module to enhance the features of the
student model with the learned generalization prototype features and guide the
training of the student model to improve its generalization ability. The
experimental results on various visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach for large-scale model cross-task knowledge distillation scenes.

gravitational-wave detector networks to constrain different cosmological models
while employing separate waveform models for inspiral and post-merger part of
the gravitational wave signal from equal mass binary neutron stars. We consider
two different avenues to measure the redshift of a gravitational-wave source:
first, we examine an electromagnetic measurement of the redshift via either a
kilonova or a gamma ray burst detection following a binary neutron star merger
(the electromagnetic counterpart method); second, we estimate the redshift from
the gravitational-wave signal itself from the adiabatic tides between the
component stars characterized by the tidal Love number, to provide a second

stringent bounds on other cosmological parameters. In the era of
next-generation gravitational-wave detector networks, both methods achieve
sub-percent measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ after one year of

also legally required for AI systems that can have a significant impact on
human lives. Fairness is another growing concern, as algorithmic decisions
should not show bias or discrimination towards certain groups or individuals
based on sensitive attributes. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims
to overcome the opaqueness of black-box models and provide transparency in how
AI systems make decisions. Interpretable ML models can explain how they make
predictions and the factors that influence their outcomes. However, most

application to bioinformatics problems challenging without customization and
domain-specific adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the importance of

detection methods only consider and analyze temporal features, in this paper, a
self-supervised learning-based anomaly node detection method based on an
autoencoder is designed. This method integrates temporal WSN data flow feature
extraction, spatial position feature extraction and intermodal WSN correlation
feature extraction into the design of the autoencoder to make full use of the
spatial and temporal information of the WSN for anomaly detection. First, a
fully connected network is used to extract the temporal features of nodes by
considering a single mode from a local spatial perspective. Second, a graph
neural network (GNN) is used to introduce the WSN topology from a global
spatial perspective for anomaly detection and extract the spatial and temporal
features of the data flows of nodes and their neighbors by considering a single
mode. Then, the adaptive fusion method involving weighted summation is used to
extract the relevant features between different models. In addition, this paper
introduces a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to solve the long-term dependence
problem of the time dimension. Eventually, the reconstructed output of the
decoder and the hidden layer representation of the autoencoder are fed into a
fully connected network to calculate the anomaly probability of the current
system. Since the spatial feature extraction operation is advanced, the
designed method can be applied to the task of large-scale network anomaly
detection by adding a clustering operation. Experiments show that the designed
method outperforms the baselines, and the F1 score reaches 90.6%, which is 5.2%

unsupervised reconstruction and prediction. Code and model are available at

data collection and labeling and appropriate data preprocessing choice and

by spatial symmetries. However, the Gamma point at zero-frequency of a photonic
system is an intrinsic degeneracy due to the polarization degree of freedom of
electromagnetic waves. We show here that in chiral photonic crystals, such an
intrinsic degeneracy node carries +(-)2 chiral topological charge and the
topological characters is the same as a spin-1 Weyl point manifested as a
triple degeneracy of two linear propagating bands intersecting a flat band
representing the electrostatic solution. Such an intrinsic triple degeneracy
point (TDP) at Gamma is usually buried in bulk band projections and the
topological charge at photonic zero-frequency has never been observed. Here, by
imposing space-group screw symmetry to the chiral photonic crystal, the
Brillouin zone boundary is transformed into an oppositely charged nodal surface
enclosing the Gamma point. The emergent Fermi-arcs on sample surface are then
forced to connect the bulk band projections of these topological singularities,
revealing the embedded non-trivial topology.

synchronization mechanism based on NTP (Network Time Protocol) is designed for
synchronizing the server and Kinect clients' clocks. Furthermore, a time
schedule is designed for timing each Kinect client's data transmission. In the
experiment, participants are asked to perform a 60 s walk while the proposed
tracking system obtains the participant's gait data. Six joints (including left
hip, right hip, left knee, right knee, left ankle and right ankle) of the
participants are tracked where the obtained gait data are described as 6000
{movements} of joint positions (1000 {movements} for each joint). The results
show that the trilateration tracking result by the three Kinect sensors has a
much higher accuracy compared with the accuracy measured by a single Kinect
sensor. Within a randomly sampled time period (67.726 s in the experiment),
98.37% of the frames generated by the gait tracking system have timing errors
less than 1 ms, which is much better than the default NTP service embedded in
the Windows 8.1 operating system. The accuracy of the proposed system is
quantitatively evaluated and verified by a comparison with a commercial medical

facing side of the flat-panel shaped spacecraft, which supports the solar
array, was tilted toward the Sun. Consequently, the nadir side, which is seen
by observers on the ground, was mostly dark. Thus, BW3 has generally appeared
faint and on some occasions was not seen at all. The amount of fading was up to
4 magnitudes. Numerical modeling indicates that the amount of tilt was in the
range 13{\deg} to 16{\deg}. This situation indicates the improvement in the
appearance of BW3 from the ground that can be achieved with small tilts of the
spacecraft. Satellite operators and astronomers can jointly address the adverse

caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is still localized
outbreak and has resulted in a high rate of infection and severe disease in
older patients with comorbidities. The vitamin D status of the population has
been found to be an important factor that could influence outcome of COVID-19.
However, whether vitamin D can lessen the symptoms or severity of COVID-19
still remains controversial. Methods: A total of 719 patients with confirmed
COVID-19 were enrolled retrospectively in this study from April 13 to June 6,
2022 at Shanghai Forth People's Hospital. The circulating levels of 25(OH)D3,
inflammatory factors, and clinical parameters were assayed. Time to viral RNA
clearance (TVRC), classification and prognosis of COVID-19 were used to
evaluate the severity of COVID-19 infection. Results: The median age was 76
years (interquartile range, IQR, 64.5-84.6), 44.1% of patients were male, and
the TVRC was 11 days (IQR, 7-16) in this population. The median level of
25(OH)D3 was 27.15 (IQR, 19.31-38.89) nmol/L. Patients with lower serum
25(OH)D3 had prolonged time to viral clearance, more obvious inflammatory
response, more severe respiratory symptoms and higher risks of impaired hepatic
and renal function. Multiple regression analyses revealed that serum 25(OH)D3
level was negatively associated with TVRC independently. ROC curve showed the
serum vitamin D level could predict the severity classification and prognosis
of COVID-19 significantly.Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D3 level is independently
associated with the severity of COVID-19 in elderly, and it could be used as a
predictor of the severity of COVID-19. In addition, supplementation with
vitamin D might provide beneficial effects in old patients with COVID-19.

data rates in the order of gigabits per second, as envisioned in 5G systems.
However, they cannot be used for long distances due to their sensitivity to
attenuation loss. To enable their use in the 5G network, it requires that the
transmission energy be focused in sharp pencil beams. As any misalignment
between the transmitter and receiver beam pair can reduce the data rate
significantly, it is important that they are aligned as much as possible. To
find the best transmit-receive beam pair, recent beam alignment (BA) techniques
examine the entire beam space, which might result in a large amount of BA
latency. Recent works propose to adaptively select the beams such that the
cumulative reward measured in terms of received signal strength or throughput
is maximized. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that exploits the unimodal
structure of the received signal strengths of the beams to identify the best
beam in a finite time using pure exploration strategies. Strategies that
identify the best beam in a fixed time slot are more suitable for wireless
network protocol design than cumulative reward maximization strategies that
continuously perform exploration and exploitation. Our algorithm is named
Unimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3) and identifies the best beam with a high
probability in a few rounds. We prove that the error exponent in the
probability does not depend on the number of beams and show that this is indeed
the case by establishing a lower bound for the unimodal bandits. We demonstrate
that UB3 outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms through extensive
simulations. Moreover, our algorithm is simple to implement and has lower
computational complexity.

have lost much of their impact on innovation, particularly in developing

attributes while also boosting the accuracy of classification. For solving
feature selection problems, this study presents a hybrid binary version of the
Harris Hawks Optimization algorithm (HHO) and Salp Swarm Optimization (SSA)
(HHOSSA) for Covid-19 classification. The proposed (HHOSSA) presents a strategy
for improving the basic HHO's performance using the Salp algorithm's power to
select the best fitness values. The HHOSSA was tested against two well-known
optimization algorithms, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Grey
wolf optimizer (GWO), utilizing a total of 800 chest X-ray images. A total of
four performance metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1) were employed in the
studies using three classifiers (Support vector machines (SVMs), k-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)). The proposed
algorithm (HHOSSA) achieved 96% accuracy with the SVM classifier, and 98%
accuracy with two classifiers, XGboost and KNN.

  In-Memory and Compute Near-Memory Paradigms","11 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The rise of data-intensive applications exposed the limitations of
conventional processor-centric von-Neumann architectures that struggle to meet
the off-chip memory bandwidth demand. Therefore, recent innovations in computer
architecture advocate compute-in-memory (CIM) and compute-near-memory (CNM),
non-von- Neumann paradigms achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in
performance and energy consumption. Despite significant technological
breakthroughs in the last few years, the programmability of these systems is
still a serious challenge. Their programming models are too low-level and
specific to particular system implementations. Since such future architectures
are predicted to be highly heterogenous, developing novel compiler abstractions
and frameworks become necessary. To this end, we present CINM (Cinnamon), a
first end-to-end compilation flow that leverages the hierarchal abstractions to
generalize over different CIM and CNM devices and enable device-agnostic and
device-aware optimizations. Cinnamon progressively lowers input programs and
performs optimizations at each level in the lowering pipeline. To show its
efficacy, we evaluate CINM on a set of benchmarks for the well-known UPMEM CNM
system and the memristors-based CIM accelerators. We show that Cinnamon,
supporting multiple hardware targets, generates high-performance code
comparable to or better than state-of-the-art implementations.

are used to per-form automated diagnoses of cornea. Deep learning networks
require large-scale annotated datasets, which is conceded as a weakness of deep
learning. In this work, a method for synthesizing medical images using
conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), is presented. It also
illustrates how produced medical images may be utilized to enrich medical data,
improve clinical decisions, and boost the performance of the conventional
neural network (CNN) for medical image diagnosis. The study includes using
corneal topography captured using a Pentacam device from patients with corneal
diseases. The dataset contained 3448 different corneal images. Furthermore, it
shows how an unbalanced dataset affects the performance of classifiers, where
the data are balanced using the resampling approach. Finally, the results
obtained from CNN networks trained on the balanced dataset are compared to
those obtained from CNN networks trained on the imbalanced dataset. For
performance, the system estimated the diagnosis accuracy, precision, and
F1-score metrics. Lastly, some generated images were shown to an expert for
evaluation and to see how well experts could identify the type of image and its
condition. The expert recognized the image as useful for medical diagnosis and
for determining the severity class according to the shape and values, by
generating images based on real cases that could be used as new different
stages of illness between healthy and unhealthy patients.

  2023) Main Track",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection can be used in deep learning-based
applications to reject outlier samples from being unreliably classified by deep
neural networks. Learning to classify between OOD and in-distribution samples
is difficult because data comprising the former is extremely diverse. It has
been observed that an auxiliary OOD dataset is most effective in training a
""rejection"" network when its samples are semantically similar to
in-distribution images. We first deduce that OOD images are perceived by a deep
neural network to be semantically similar to in-distribution samples when they
share a common background, as deep networks are observed to incorrectly
classify such images with high confidence. We then propose a simple yet
effective Key In-distribution feature Replacement BY inpainting (KIRBY)
procedure that constructs a surrogate OOD dataset by replacing
class-discriminative features of in-distribution samples with marginal
background features. The procedure can be implemented using off-the-shelf
vision algorithms, where each step within the algorithm is shown to make the
surrogate data increasingly similar to in-distribution data. Design choices in
each step are studied extensively, and an exhaustive comparison with
state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates KIRBY's competitiveness on various
benchmarks.

directly, we consider the structure difference between the RF signals and the
human poses, propose to transform the RF signals to the pose domain on the
feature level based on Optimal Transport (OT) theory, and generate human poses
from the transformed features. To evaluate RFPose-OT, we build a radio system
and a multi-view camera system to acquire the RF signal data and the
ground-truth human poses. The experimental results in basic indoor environment,
occlusion indoor environment, and outdoor environment, all demonstrate that
RFPose-OT can predict 3D human poses with higher precision than the

and land management. Machine learning-based methods has become a popular
approach for crop mapping in recent years. However, the key to machine
learning, acquiring ample and accurate samples, is usually time-consuming and
laborious. To solve this problem, a crop mapping method in the small sample/no
sample case that integrating domain knowledge and using a cascaded
classification framework that combine a weak classifier learned from samples
with strong features and a strong classifier trained by samples with weak
feature was proposed. First, based on the domain knowledge of various crops, a
low-capacity classifier such as decision tree was applied to acquire those
pixels with distinctive features and complete observation sequences as ""strong
feature"" samples. Then, to improve the representativeness of these samples,
sample augmentation strategy that artificially remove the observations of
""strong feature"" samples according to the average valid observation proportion
in target area was applied. Finally, based on the original samples and
augmented samples, a large-capacity classifier such as random forest was
trained for crop mapping. The method achieved an overall accuracy of 82% in the
MAP crop recognition competition held by Syngenta Group, China in 2021 (third
prize, ranked fourth). This method integrates domain knowledge to overcome the
difficulties of sample acquisition, providing a convenient, fast and accurate
solution for crop mapping.
