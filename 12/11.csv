  Case Study in Neural Text Classification","EMNLP BlackboxNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some recent works observed the instability of post-hoc explanations when
input side perturbations are applied to the model. This raises the interest and
concern in the stability of post-hoc explanations. However, the remaining
question is: is the instability caused by the neural network model or the
post-hoc explanation method? This work explores the potential source that leads
to unstable post-hoc explanations. To separate the influence from the model, we
propose a simple output probability perturbation method. Compared to prior
input side perturbation methods, the output probability perturbation method can
circumvent the neural model's potential effect on the explanations and allow
the analysis on the explanation method. We evaluate the proposed method with
three widely-used post-hoc explanation methods (LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016),
Kernel Shapley (Lundberg and Lee, 2017a), and Sample Shapley (Strumbelj and
Kononenko, 2010)). The results demonstrate that the post-hoc methods are
stable, barely producing discrepant explanations under output probability
perturbations. The observation suggests that neural network models may be the
primary source of fragile explanations.

However, obtaining exhaustively labeled 4D datasets is often very expensive and
laborious, so it is especially important to investigate how to utilize raw
unlabeled data. However, most existing self-supervised point cloud
representation learning methods only consider geometry from a static snapshot
omitting the fact that sequential observations of dynamic scenes could reveal
more comprehensive geometric details. And the video representation learning
frameworks mostly model motion as image space flows, let alone being
3D-geometric-aware. To overcome such issues, this paper proposes a new 4D
self-supervised pre-training method called Complete-to-Partial 4D Distillation.
Our key idea is to formulate 4D self-supervised representation learning as a
teacher-student knowledge distillation framework and let the student learn
useful 4D representations with the guidance of the teacher. Experiments show
that this approach significantly outperforms previous pre-training approaches
on a wide range of 4D point cloud sequence understanding tasks including indoor

These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the

poorly in the presence of high-dimensionality data. To this end, we propose a
pipeline for clustering-based vertical partitioning that takes into
consideration both parallelization and cross-partition pattern merging needs.
Given a specific type of pattern coherence, these clusters are built based on
the likelihood that variables form those patterns. Subsequently, the extracted
patterns per cluster are then merged together into a final set of closed
patterns. This approach is evaluated using five published datasets. Results
show that in some of the tested data, execution times yield statistically
significant improvements when variables are clustered together based on the
likelihood to form specific types of patterns, as opposed to partitions based
on dissimilarity or randomness. This work offers a departuring step on the
efficiency impact of vertical partitioning criteria along the different stages

from layer-by-layer scheduling to cross-layer depth-first scheduling (a.k.a.
layer fusion, or cascaded execution). This results in a very broad scheduling
space, with each schedule leading to varying hardware (HW) costs in terms of
energy and latency. To rapidly explore this vast space for a wide variety of
hardware architectures, analytical cost models are crucial to estimate
scheduling effects on the HW level. However, state-of-the-art cost models are
lacking support for exploring the complete depth-first scheduling space, for
instance focusing only on activations while ignoring weights, or modeling only
DRAM accesses while overlooking on-chip data movements. These limitations
prevent researchers from systematically and accurately understanding the
depth-first scheduling space.
  After formalizing this design space, this work proposes a unified modeling
framework, DeFiNES, for layer-by-layer and depth-first scheduling to fill in
the gaps. DeFiNES enables analytically estimating the hardware cost for
possible schedules in terms of both energy and latency, while considering data
access at every memory level. This is done for each schedule and HW
architecture under study by optimally choosing the active part of the memory
hierarchy per unique combination of operand, layer, and feature map tile. The
hardware costs are estimated, taking into account both data computation and
data copy phases. The analytical cost model is validated against measured data
from a taped-out depth-first DNN accelerator, DepFiN, showing good modeling
accuracy at the end-to-end neural network level. A comparison with generalized
state-of-the-art demonstrates up to 10X better solutions found with DeFiNES.

microwave response of the system exhibits strong frequency dispersion, arising
from nonequilibrium vortex core quasiparticles. The corresponding contribution
to the ac conductivity is controlled by the inelastic relaxation time, and may
exceed the usual Bardeen-Stephen conductivity. It is caused by the Debye-type
inelastic relaxation. Debye mechanism of microwave losses may be responsible
for strong effects of electromagnetic noise upon dc conductivity in the mixed

present unique challenges in instrumentation and data analysis. An accurate
preflight simulation of LISA data is a vital part of the development of both
the instrument and the analysis methods. The simulation must include a detailed
model of the full measurement and analysis chain, capturing the main features

propose a new model that includes, for the first time, proper relativistic
treatment of reference frames with realistic orbits; a model for onboard clocks
and clock synchronization measurements; proper modeling of total laser
frequencies, including laser locking, frequency planning and Doppler shifts;
better treatment of onboard processing and updated noise models. We then
introduce two implementations of this model, LISANode and LISA Instrument. We
demonstrate that TDI processing successfully recovers gravitational-wave
signals from the significantly more realistic and complex simulated data.
LISANode and LISA Instrument are already widely used by the LISA community and,
for example, currently provide the mock data for the LISA Data Challenges.

research utilizes incentive designs to analyze agent behaviors. To achieve

rationality and game-theoretical solution concepts to study the equilibrium

consider the possibility for agents to learn from historical observations.
Therefore, we abstract a general consensus protocol as a dynamic game

equilibria. In our game, agents imitatively learn the global history in an
evolutionary process toward equilibria, for which we evaluate the outcomes from

anisotropic atom-molecule interactions. We apply the methodology to study
collisional relaxation of the nuclear spin sublevels of $^{13}$CO molecules
immersed in a cold buffer gas of $^4$He atoms. We find that nuclear spin
relaxation in the ground rotational manifold of CO occurs extremely slowly due
to the absence of direct couplings between the nuclear spin sublevels. The
rates of collisional transitions between the $N=1$ nuclear spin states of CO
are generally much higher due to the direct nuclear spin-rotation coupling
between the states. These transitions obey selection rules, which depend on the
values of space-fixed projections of rotational and nuclear spin angular
momenta for the initial and final molecular states. For some initial states, we
also observe a strong magnetic field dependence, which can be understood using
the first Born approximation. We use our calculated nuclear spin relaxation
rates to investigate the thermalization of a single nuclear spin state of
CO$(N=0)$ immersed in a cold buffer gas of He. The calculated nuclear spin
relaxation times ($T_1\simeq 0.5$ s at $T=1$ K) display a steep temperature
dependence decreasing rapidly at elevated temperatures due to the increased
population of rotationally excited states, which undergo nuclear spin
relaxation at a much faster rate. Thus, long relaxation times of $N=0$ nuclear
spin states in cold collisions with buffer gas atoms can only be maintained at
sufficiently low temperatures ($kT\ll 2B_e$), where $B_e$ is the rotational

the convergence of the gradient-tracking based algorithm under both constant

framework that can treat gradient-tracking based distributed optimization under
both constant and time-varying stepsizes in a unified manner. More importantly,
the new analyzing approach gives a much less conservative analytical bound on
the stepsize compared with existing proof techniques for gradient-tracking

influence of differential-privacy design on the accuracy of distributed
optimization, which reveals that inter-agent interaction has a significant

measurement of depth is often impracticable. Fortunately, though, modern
learning-based methods offer promising depth maps by inference in the wild. In
this work, we adapt such depth inference models for object segmentation using
the objects' ``pop-out'' prior in 3D. The ``pop-out'' is a simple composition
prior that assumes objects reside on the background surface. Such compositional
prior allows us to reason about objects in the 3D space. More specifically, we
adapt the inferred depth maps such that objects can be localized using only 3D
information. Such separation, however, requires knowledge about contact surface
which we learn using the weak supervision of the segmentation mask. Our
intermediate representation of contact surface, and thereby reasoning about
objects purely in 3D, allows us to better transfer the depth knowledge into
semantics. The proposed adaptation method uses only the depth model without
needing the source data used for training, making the learning process
efficient and practical. Our experiments on eight datasets of two challenging

the trace of a morphism is calculated via the execution formula, which adds up
the contribution of all possible paths of the control flow. Haghverdi's unique
decomposition categories are generalised to admit additive inverses and
equipped with convergence criteria using basic topology. In this setting, it is
possible to prove the validity of the execution formula as a categorical trace
on certain categories of quantum processes.
  (ii) A weak while loop is a classical control flow primitive that offers a
trade-off between the collapse caused on each iteration and the amount of
information gained. The trade-off may be adjusted by tuning a parameter and, in
certain situations, it is possible to set its value so that we may control the
algorithm without sacrificing its quantum speed-up. As an example, it is shown
that Grover's search problem can be implemented using a weak while loop,
maintaining the same time complexity as the standard Grover's algorithm (as
previously shown by Mizel).

multiple subsystems of a many-body quantum system. While multipartite
entanglement can be difficult to quantify analytically, it is known that it can
be witnessed through the Quantum Fisher information (QFI), a quantity that can
also be related to dynamical Kubo response functions. In this work, we first
show that the finite temperature QFI can generally be expressed in terms of a
static structure factor of the system, plus a correction that vanishes as
$T\rightarrow 0$. We argue that this implies that the static structure factor
witnesses multipartite entanglement near quantum critical points at
temperatures below a characteristic energy scale that is determined by
universal properties, up to a non-universal amplitude. Therefore, in systems
with a known static structure factor, we can deduce finite temperature scaling
of multipartite entanglement and low temperature entanglement depth without
knowledge of the full dynamical response function of the system. This is
particularly useful to study 1D quantum critical systems in which sub-power-law
divergences can dominate entanglement growth, where the conventional scaling
theory of the QFI breaks down. The 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model is an important example of such a system, and we show that
multipartite entanglement in the Heisenberg chain diverges non-trivially as
$\sim \log(1/T)^{3/2}$. We verify these predictions with calculations of the
QFI using conformal field theory and matrix product state simulations. Finally
we discuss the implications of our results for experiments to probe
entanglement in quantum materials, comparing to neutron scattering data in
KCuF$_3$, a material well-described by the Heisenberg chain.

(ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence
of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the
inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we
propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the
reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error
(DTE), is computed in four steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated
trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the
origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of
geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the
estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their
geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute the
distances between the corresponding cameras, and obtain the DTE by taking the
average of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) distance. This metric is an
attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the
varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of
outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error
metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to
the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating
the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our

method to learn propensity functions from non-mass-action kinetics. We test our

diameters of the components of $\mathbb C\setminus K$ are bounded below. The
results indicate that if $R^t(K,\mu)$ is pure, then $R^t(K,\mu) \cap L^\infty
(\mu)$ is the ""same as"" the algebra of bounded analytic functions on
$\mbox{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu)),$ the set of analytic bounded point evaluations. We
show that if the diameters of the components of $\mathbb C\setminus K$ are
allowed to tend to zero, then even though $\text{int}(K) = \mbox{abpe}(R^t(K,
\mu))$ and $K =\overline {\text{int}(K)},$ the algebra $R^t(K,\mu) \cap
L^\infty (\mu)$ may ""be equal to"" a proper sub-algebra of bounded analytic
functions on $\text{int}(K),$ where functions in the sub-algebra are
""continuous"" on certain portions of the inner boundary of $K.$

untargeted attacks can disrupt the user experience and bring severe financial

delve into the untargeted attack and its defense for FedRec systems. (i) We
propose ClusterAttack, a novel untargeted attack method. It uploads poisonous

make the recommender generate similar scores for these items in the same

design a contrastive learning task that regularizes the item embeddings toward
a uniform distribution. Then the server filters out these malicious gradients
by estimating the uniformity of updated item embeddings. Experiments on two
public datasets show that ClusterAttack can effectively degrade the performance
of FedRec systems while circumventing many defense methods, and UNION can
improve the resistance of the system against various untargeted attacks,

Pseudo-labeling is commonly used in a few-shot setup, where approximate labels

turbulent Rayleigh--B\'enard convection (RBC) and form the state space skeleton

two-dimensional (2D) RBC between no-slip boundaries reveal that for fixed
Rayleigh number $Ra$ and Prandtl number $Pr$, the heat-flux-maximizing solution
is always in the high-wavenumber regime. In this study, we explore the
high-wavenumber steady convection roll solutions that bifurcate supercritically
from the motionless conductive state for 2D RBC between stress-free boundaries.
Our computations confirm the existence of a local heat-flux-maximizing solution
in the high-wavenumber regime. To elucidate the asymptotic properties of this
solution, we perform computations over eight orders of magnitude in the
Rayleigh number, $10^{8} \le Ra \le 10^{16.5}$, and two orders of magnitude in
the Prandtl number, $10^{-1} \leq Pr \leq 10^{3/2}$. The numerical results
indicate that as $Ra\to\infty$, the local heat-flux-maximizing aspect ratio
$\Gamma^*_{loc}\simeq Ra^{-1/4}$, the Nusselt number $Nu(\Gamma^*_{loc})\simeq
Ra^{0.29}$, and the Reynolds number $Re(\Gamma^*_{loc})\simeq Pr^{-1}Ra^{2/5}$,
with all prefactors depending on $Pr$. Moreover, the interior flow of the local
$Nu$-maximizing solution can be well described by an analytical heat-exchanger
solution, and the connection to the high-wavenumber asymptotic solution given
by Blennerhassett & Bassom is discussed. With a fixed aspect ratio
$0.06\le\Gamma\le\pi/5$ at $Pr=1$, however, our computations show that as $Ra$
increases, the steady rolls converge to the semi-analytical asymptotic
solutions constructed by Chini & Cox, with scalings $Nu\sim Ra^{1/3}$ and
$Re\sim Pr^{-1}Ra^{2/3}$. Finally, a phase diagram is delineated to gain a

the weights of biased samples during the training process. However, these

alleviate the above problems based on contrastive learning. We devise a
debiasing, positive sampling strategy to mitigate biased latent features by
selecting the least similar biased positive samples. We also propose a dynamic
negative sampling strategy to capture the dynamic influence of biases by
employing a bias-only model to dynamically select the most similar biased
negative samples. We conduct experiments on three NLU benchmark datasets.
Experimental results show that DCT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on

also verify that DCT can reduce biased latent features from the model's

nanostructures of III-V and II-VI semiconductors, but the emergence of
two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers an alternative low-dimensional
platform for spintronic phenomena. Indium selenide (InSe), a group-III
monochalcogenide van der Waals material, has shown promise for opto-electronics
due to its high electron mobility, tunable direct bandgap, and quantum
transport. There are predictions of spin-dependent optical selection rules
suggesting potential for all-optical excitation and control of spin in a
two-dimensional layered material. Despite these predictions, layer-dependent
optical spin phenomena in InSe have yet to be explored. Here, we present
measurements of layer-dependent optical spin dynamics in few-layer and bulk
InSe. Polarized photoluminescence reveals layer-dependent optical orientation
of spin, thereby demonstrating the optical selection rules in few-layer InSe.
Spin dynamics are also studied in many-layer InSe using time-resolved Kerr
rotation spectroscopy. By applying out-of-plane and in-plane static magnetic
fields for polarized emission measurements and Kerr measurements, respectively,
the $g$-factor for InSe was extracted. Further investigations are done by
calculating precession values using a $\textbf{k} \cdot \textbf{p}$ model,
which is supported by \textit{ab-initio} density functional theory. Comparison
of predicted precession rates with experimental measurements highlights the
importance of excitonic effects in InSe for understanding spin dynamics.
Optical orientation of spin is an important prerequisite for opto-spintronic
phenomena and devices, and these first demonstrations of layer-dependent
optical excitation of spins in InSe lay the foundation for combining
layer-dependent spin properties with advantageous electronic properties found

  graphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1992 Bir\'{o}, Hujter and Tuza introduced, for every fixed connected graph
$H$, the class of $H$-graphs, defined as the intersection graphs of connected
subgraphs of some subdivision of $H$. Recently, quite a lot of research has
been devoted to understanding the tractability border for various computational
problems, such as recognition or isomorphism testing, in classes of $H$-graphs
for different graphs $H$. In this work we undertake this research topic,
focusing on the recognition problem. Chaplick, T\""{o}pfer, Voborn\'{\i}k, and
Zeman showed, for every fixed tree $T$, a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing
$T$-graphs. Tucker showed a polynomial time algorithm recognizing $K_3$-graphs
(circular-arc graphs). On the other hand, Chaplick at al. showed that
recognition of $H$-graphs is $NP$-hard if $H$ contains two different cycles
sharing an edge.
  The main two results of this work narrow the gap between the $NP$-hard and
$P$ cases of $H$-graphs recognition. First, we show that recognition of
$H$-graphs is $NP$-hard when $H$ contains two different cycles. On the other
hand, we show a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing $L$-graphs, where $L$ is
a graph containing a cycle and an edge attached to it ($L$-graphs are called
lollipop graphs). Our work leaves open the recognition problems of $M$-graphs
for every unicyclic graph $M$ different from a cycle and a lollipop. Other
results of this work, which shed some light on the cases that remain open, are
as follows. Firstly, the recognition of $M$-graphs, where $M$ is a fixed
unicyclic graph, admits a polynomial time algorithm if we restrict the input to
graphs containing particular holes (hence recognition of $M$-graphs is probably
most difficult for chordal graphs). Secondly, the recognition of medusa graphs,
which are defined as the union of $M$-graphs, where $M$ runs over all unicyclic
graphs, is $NP$-complete.

that detecting otoacoustic emissions, which are the faint sounds generated by

devices for hearing screening cost thousands of dollars and are inaccessible in
low and middle income countries. We show that by designing wireless earbuds
using low-cost acoustic hardware and combining them with wireless sensing

pulses emitted from a low-cost speaker to reliably separate otoacoustic
emissions from in-ear reflections and echoes. We conducted a clinical study
with 50 ears across two healthcare sites. Our study shows that the low-cost
earbuds detect hearing loss with 100% sensitivity and 89.7% specificity, which
is comparable to the performance of a $8000 medical device. By developing

practical quantum computer. However, propagating light also has a drawback: the
difficulty of logical encoding due to weak nonlinearity. Here, we propose
Gaussian breeding that encodes arbitrary Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits
in propagating light. The key idea is the efficient and iterable generation of
quantum superpositions by photon detectors, which is the most widely used
nonlinear element in quantum propagating light. This formulation makes it
possible to systematically create the desired qubits with minimal resources.
Our simulations show that GKP qubits above a fault-tolerant threshold,

stationary DSP dressed by the Rydberg-state dipole-dipole interaction (DDI).
The DDI-induced phase shift of the stationary DSP was systematically studied.
Notably, the experimental data are consistent with the theoretical predictions.
The phase shift can be viewed as a consequence of elastic collisions. In terms
of thermalization to achieve BEC, the $\mu$m$^2$-size interaction cross-section
of the DDI can produce a sufficient elastic collision rate for the stationary
DSPs. This work makes a substantial advancement toward the realization of the

By virtue of its conductivity, high carrier mobility and optical transparency,
SrVO$_3$ can be used as a potential replacement of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a
transparent conductor. As strain tuning is an effective way to tune the
electron-electron correlations in correlated oxides, the epitaxial strain
induced variations in V-3d bandwidth, band center shift and band splitting at
high symmetry points (${\Gamma}$, R) in SrVO$_3$ are investigated. The
alterations in resistivity, carrier concentration, Hall coefficient and plasma
frequency with applied strain are also elucidated. Our calculations revealed
that under tensile strain, the lifting of the threefold degeneracy of
3d-t$_{2g}$ orbital and d-band narrowing reinforces a relatively less
conducting state thus limiting the $\omega_P$ to lower frequencies. On the
contrary, in case of compressive strain the d-band widening predominates
leading to an increase in carrier concentration and decrease in resistivity
enhancing the metallic state. As a result, $\omega_P$ is increased to higher
frequencies which decreases the optical transparency window. Hence, our results
and findings clearly demonstrate the interdependence between the optical and
transport properties, and provides a detailed mechanism to tune the
optoelectronic properties of SrVO$_3$ for its applications as a transparent
conducting oxide.

the relative distance asymptotically for a large number of walk steps and find

also study the extremal relative distances between the particles, and show the

converge well from scratch due to lacking inductive bias and easy to focus on
the occlusion and noisy areas. TransFER, a representative transformer-based
method for FER, alleviates this with multi-branch attention dropping but brings
excessive computations. On the contrary, we present two attentive pooling (AP)

emphasize the most discriminative features while reducing the impacts of less

simple to implement and without learnable parameters, the APP and ATP
intuitively reduce the computational cost while boosting the performance by
ONLY pursuing the most discriminative features. Qualitative results demonstrate
the motivations and effectiveness of our attentive poolings. Besides,
quantitative results on six in-the-wild datasets outperform other

interaction between shock and instability waves in two-dimensional supersonic
jet flows. The jet is considered to be of vortex-sheet type and 2D Euler
equations are linearised to determine the governing equations for shock,
instability waves, and their interaction. Pack's model is used to describe
shock waves, while instability waves are calculated using spatial stability
analysis. The interaction between shock and instability waves can be solved
analytically by performing Fourier transform and subsequently using the method
of steepest descent. Sound produced by the interaction between the instability
wave and a single shock cell is studied first, after which that due to a number
of cells follows. We find that the model developed in this study can correctly
predict the frequencies of the fundamental screech tone and its first and
second harmonics. We show that the predicted sound directivity, even from a
single shock cell, is in good agreement with experimental data. In particular,
this model shows the strongest noise emission close to the upstream direction
but the emitted noise starts to rapidly decay as the observer angle approaches
180 degrees, which is in accordance with experimental results; this suggests
that the effective noise from a single shock cell is far from of the monopole
type as assumed in the classical Powell's model. We find that the noise
directivity is very sensitive to the local growth rate of the instability waves
and the noise is generated primarily through the Mach wave mechanism.

extensible model checker based on DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction). A
mechanism was invented to declare to McMini new, primitive thread operations,
typically in 100~lines or less of C~code. The mechanism was extended to also
allow the end user to declare alternative thread wakeup policies, including
spurious wakeups from condition variables. One declares: (I) under what
conditions an operation is enabled; (ii) which thread operations are
independent of each other; and (iii) when two operations can be considered as
co-enabled. An optional wakeup policy is implemented by defining when a wait
operation (on a semaphore, condition variable, etc.) is enabled. A new enqueue
thread operation is described, allowing a user to declare alternative wakeup
policies. McMini was first confirmed to operate correctly and efficiently as a
traditional, but extensible model checker for mutex, semaphore, condition
variable, and reader-writer. McMini's extensibility was then tested on novel
primitive operations, representing other useful paradigms for multithreaded
operations. An example is readers-and-two-writers. The speed of model checking
was found to be five times faster and more, as compared to traditional
implementations on top of condition variables. Alternative wakeup policies
(e.g., FIFO, LIFO, arbitrary, etc.) were then tested using an enqueue
operation. Finally, spurious wakeups were tested with a program that exposes a
bug only in the presence of a spurious wakeup.

networks, where nodes typically operate on limited battery power. Reducing
communicating power consumption is essential for both economic and ecologic
reasons. In fact, transmitting at unnecessarily high power not only reduces
node lifetime, but also introduces excessive interference and electromagnetic
pollution. Existing work in the wireless community mostly focus on designing
transmit power policies by taking into account communication aspects like
quality of service or network capacity. Wireless networked control systems
(WNCSs), on the other hand, have different and specific needs such as
stability, which require transmit power policies adapted to the control
context. Transmit power design in the control community has recently attracted
much attention, and available works mostly consider linear systems or specific
classes of non-linear systems with a single-link view of the system. In this
paper, we propose a framework for the design of stabilising transmit power
levels that applies to much larger classes of non-linear plants, controllers,
and multi-link setting. By exploiting the fact that channel success
probabilities are related to transmit power in a non-linear fashion, we first
derive closed-loop stability conditions that relate channel probabilities with
transmission rate. Next, we combine these results together with well-known and
realistic interference models to provide a design methodology for stabilising
transmit power in non-linear and multi-link WNCSs.

in leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve downstream task
performance. However, increasing the scale of unlabeled pre-training data in
real-world scenarios requires prohibitive computational costs and faces the
challenge of uncurated samples. To address these issues, we build a
task-specific self-supervised pre-training framework from a data selection
perspective based on a simple hypothesis that pre-training on the unlabeled
samples with similar distribution to the target task can bring substantial
performance gains. Buttressed by the hypothesis, we propose the first yet novel
framework for Scalable and Efficient visual Pre-Training (SEPT) by introducing
a retrieval pipeline for data selection. SEPT first leverage a self-supervised
pre-trained model to extract the features of the entire unlabeled dataset for
retrieval pipeline initialization. Then, for a specific target task, SEPT
retrievals the most similar samples from the unlabeled dataset based on feature
similarity for each target instance for pre-training. Finally, SEPT pre-trains
the target model with the selected unlabeled samples in a self-supervised
manner for target data finetuning. By decoupling the scale of pre-training and
available upstream data for a target task, SEPT achieves high scalability of
the upstream dataset and high efficiency of pre-training, resulting in high
model architecture flexibility. Results on various downstream tasks demonstrate
that SEPT can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with
ImageNet pre-training while reducing the size of training samples by one

approximation of elliptic PDEs. We present here an extension of the hybrid
high-order method to meshes possessing curved edges/faces. Such an extension
allows us to enforce boundary conditions exactly on curved domains, and capture
curved geometries that appear internally in the domain e.g. discontinuities in
a diffusion coefficient. The method makes use of non-polynomial functions on
the curved faces and does not require any mappings between reference
elements/faces. Such an approach does not require the faces to be polynomial,
and has a strict upper bound on the number of degrees of freedom on a curved
face for a given polynomial degree. Moreover, this approach of enriching the
space of unknowns on the curved faces with non-polynomial functions should
extend naturally to other polytopal methods. We show the method to be stable
and consistent on curved meshes and derive optimal error estimates in $L^2$ and
energy norms. We present numerical examples of the method on a domain with
curved boundary, and for a diffusion problem such that the diffusion tensor is
discontinuous along a curved arc.

  Urban Canyons",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GNSS and LiDAR odometry are complementary as they provide absolute and
relative positioning, respectively. Their integration in a loosely-coupled
manner is straightforward but is challenged in urban canyons due to the GNSS
signal reflections. Recent proposed 3D LiDAR-aided (3DLA) GNSS methods employ
the point cloud map to identify the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception of GNSS
signals. This facilitates the GNSS receiver to obtain improved urban
positioning but not achieve a sub-meter level. GNSS real-time kinematics (RTK)
uses carrier phase measurements to obtain decimeter-level positioning. In urban
areas, the GNSS RTK is not only challenged by multipath and NLOS-affected
measurement but also suffers from signal blockage by the building. The latter
will impose a challenge in solving the ambiguity within the carrier phase
measurements. In the other words, the model observability of the ambiguity
resolution (AR) is greatly decreased. This paper proposes to generate virtual
satellite (VS) measurements using the selected LiDAR landmarks from the
accumulated 3D point cloud maps (PCM). These LiDAR-PCM-made VS measurements are
tightly-coupled with GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Thus, the
VS measurements can provide complementary constraints, meaning providing
low-elevation-angle measurements in the across-street directions. The
implementation is done using factor graph optimization to solve an accurate
float solution of the ambiguity before it is fed into LAMBDA. The effectiveness
of the proposed method has been validated by the evaluation conducted on our
recently open-sourced challenging dataset, UrbanNav. The result shows the fix
rate of the proposed 3DLA GNSS RTK is about 30% while the conventional GNSS-RTK
only achieves about 14%. In addition, the proposed method achieves sub-meter
positioning accuracy in most of the data collected in challenging urban areas.

emergence of graph neural networks (GNN), graph anomaly detection has been
greatly developed. However, recent studies have shown that GNN-based methods

captures the extent of significance between different views, while the

theoretically and experimentally elaborate the effectiveness of the fusion

  We present a novel data analysis method for detecting signatures of
dense-matter phase transitions in sets of mass-radius measurements, and study
its sensitivity with respect to the size of observational errors and the number
of observations. The method is based on machine learning anomaly detection
coupled with normalizing flows technique: the algorithm trained on samples of
astrophysical observations featuring no phase transition signatures interprets
a phase transition sample as an ''anomaly''. For the sake of this study, we
focus on dense-matter equations of state leading to detached branches of
mass-radius sequences (strong phase transitions), use an
astrophysically-informed neutron-star mass function, and various magnitudes of
observational errors and sample sizes.
  The method is shown to reliably detect cases of mass-radius relations with
phase transition signatures, while increasing its sensitivity with decreasing
measurement errors and increasing number of observations. We discuss marginal
cases, when the phase transition mass is located near the edges of the mass
function range. Evaluated on the current state-of-art selection of real
measurements of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations, the method
gives inconclusive results, which we interpret as due to small available sample
size, large observational errors and complex systematics.

The globular cluster (GC) system of Circinus galaxy has not been
probed previously partly because of the location of the galaxy at - 3.8$^\circ$
Galactic latitude which suffers severely from interstellar extinction, stellar
crowding, and Galactic foreground contamination. However, the deep
near-infrared (NIR) photometry by the VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea
Extended Survey (VVVX) in combination with the precise astrometry of Gaia EDR3
allow us to map GCs in this region.
  Aims. Our long-term goal is to study and characterise the distributions of
GCs and Ultra-compact dwarfs of Circinus galaxy which is the nearest Seyfert II
galaxy. Here we conduct the first pilot search for GCs in this galaxy.
  Methods. We use NIR VVVX photometry in combination with Gaia EDR3 astrometric
features such as astrometric excess noise and BP/RP excess factor to build the
first homogeneous catalogue of GCs in Circinus galaxy. A robust combination of
selection criteria allows us to effectively clean interlopers from our sample.
  Results. We report the detection of$\sim$ 70 GC candidates in this galaxy at
a 3 $\sigma$ confidence level. They show a bimodal colour distribution with the
blue peak at (G-Ks)$_0$ = 0.985$\pm$0.127 mag with a dispersion of
0.211$\pm$0.091 mag and the red peak at (G-Ks)$_0$ = 1.625$\pm$0.177 mag with a
dispersion of 0.482$\pm$0.114 mag. A GC specific frequency (S$_N$) of
1.3$\pm$0.2 was derived for the galaxy, and we estimated a total population of
120$\pm$40 GCs. Based on the projected radial distribution it appears that
Circinus has a different distribution of GC candidates than MW and M31.
  Conclusions. We demonstrate that Circinus galaxy hosts a sizeable number of
cluster candidates. This result is the first leap towards understanding the
evolution of old stellar clusters in this galaxy.

not always plays the same role. For the first time, we find that the Hawking

in the BEH has stronger steerability than the observer who locates in CEH.
Further, we study the steering asymmetry, and the conditions for two-way,
one-way and no-way steering in the SdS spacetime. Finally, we study the
Gaussian quantum steering in the scenario of effective equilibrium temperature.
We show that quantum steering reduces monotonically with the effective

black hole, which banishes the belief that the Hawking effect can only destroy
quantum steering.

large experimental overheads of SWAP gates. In this study, we consider
employing a virtual two-qubit gate (VTQG) as an error suppression technique.
The VTQG enables a non-local operation between a pair of distant qubits using
only single qubit gates and projective measurements. Here, we apply the VTQG to
the digital quantum simulation of the transverse-field Ising model on an IBM
quantum computer to suppress the errors due to the noisy two-qubit operations.
We present an effective use of VTQG, where the reduction of multiple SWAP gates
results in increasing the fidelity of the output states. The obtained results
indicate that the VTQG can be useful for suppressing the errors due to the
additional SWAP gates. Additionally, by combining a pulse-efficient
transpilation method with the VTQG, further suppression of the errors is
observed. In our experiments, we have observed one order of magnitude
improvement in accuracy for the quantum simulation of the transverse-field
Ising model with 8 qubits.

  Attacks: An Attack Detection Scheduling Approach",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In large scale networks, communication links between nodes are easily
injected with false data by adversaries, so this paper proposes a novel
security defense strategy to ensure the security of the network from the
perspective of attack detection scheduling. Compared with existing attack
detection methods, the attack detection scheduling strategy in this paper only
needs to detect half of the neighbor node information to ensure the security of
the node local state estimation. We first formulate the problem of selecting
the sensor to be detected as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is
Nondeterminism Polynomial hard (NP-hard). To solve the above problem, we
convert the objective function into a submodular function. Then, we propose an
attack detection scheduling algorithm based on sequential submodular
maximization, which incorporates expert problem to better cope with dynamic
attack strategies. The proposed algorithm can run in polynomial time with a
theoretical lower bound on the optimization rate. In addition, the proposed
algorithm can guarantee the security of the whole network under two kinds of
insecurity conditions from the perspective of the augmented estimation error.
Finally, a numerical simulation of the industrial continuous stirred tank
reactor verifies the effectiveness of the developed approach.

labels of moving objects transportation modes, has been widely applied to a
variety of real world applications, such as traffic management, urban
computing, and behavior study. However, existing studies of transportation mode
classification typically extract the explicit features of trajectory data but
fail to capture the implicit features that affect the classification
performance. In addition, most of the existing studies also prefer to apply
RNN-based models to embed trajectories, which is only suitable for classifying
small-scale data. To tackle the above challenges, we propose an effective and
scalable framework for transportation mode classification over GPS
trajectories, abbreviated Estimator. Estimator is established on a developed
CNN-TCN architecture, which is capable of leveraging the spatial and temporal
hidden features of trajectories to achieve high effectiveness and efficiency.
Estimator partitions the entire traffic space into disjointed spatial regions
according to traffic conditions, which enhances the scalability significantly
and thus enables parallel transportation classification. Extensive experiments
using eight public real-life datasets offer evidence that Estimator i) achieves
superior model effectiveness (i.e., 99% Accuracy and 0.98 F1-score), which
outperforms state-of-the-arts substantially; ii) exhibits prominent model
efficiency, and obtains 7-40x speedups up over state-of-the-arts learning-based
methods; and iii) shows high model scalability and robustness that enables
large-scale classification analytics.

Focal-PETR additionally introduces a down-sampling strategy to reduce the

the horizon area. For sufficiently small fraction of mass in the outermost
layer, the model admits ground states which can spin fast enough within the
perturbative regime so as to describe regular rotating objects rather than

  Approach","28 pages,16 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Renewable energy is critical for combating climate change, whose first step
is the storage of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Li-ion
batteries are a popular kind of storage units. Their continuous usage through
charge-discharge cycles eventually leads to degradation. This can be visualized
in plotting voltage discharge curves (VDCs) over discharge cycles. Studies of
battery degradation have mostly concentrated on modeling degradation through
one scalar measurement summarizing each VDC. Such simplification of curves can
lead to inaccurate predictive models. Here we analyze the degradation of
rechargeable Li-ion batteries from a NASA data set through modeling and
predicting their full VDCs. With techniques from longitudinal and functional
data analysis, we propose a new two-step predictive modeling procedure for
functional responses residing on heterogeneous domains. We first predict the
shapes and domain end points of VDCs using functional regression models. Then
we integrate these predictions to perform a degradation analysis. Our approach
is fully functional, allows the incorporation of usage information, produces
predictions in a curve form, and thus provides flexibility in the assessment of
battery degradation. Through extensive simulation studies and cross-validated
data analysis, our approach demonstrates better prediction than the existing
approach of modeling degradation directly with aggregated data.

save it into structured documents. This is usually split into two sub-tasks:
text localization and optical character recognition (OCR). Most existing OCR
models only focus on the cropped text instance images, which require the
bounding box information provided by a text region detection model. Introducing
an additional detector to identify the text instance images in advance is
inefficient, however instance-level OCR models have very low accuracy when
processing the whole image for the document-level OCR, such as receipt images
containing multiple text lines arranged in various layouts. To this end, we
propose a localization-free document-level OCR model for transcribing all the
characters in a receipt image into an ordered sequence end-to-end.
Specifically, we finetune the pretrained Transformer-based instance-level model
TrOCR with randomly cropped image chunks, and gradually increase the image
chunk size to generalize the recognition ability from instance images to
full-page images. In our experiments on the SROIE receipt OCR dataset, the
model finetuned with our strategy achieved 64.4 F1-score and a 22.8% character
error rates (CER) on the word-level and character-level metrics, respectively,
which outperforms the baseline results with 48.5 F1-score and 50.6% CER. The
best model, which splits the full image into 15 equally sized chunks, gives
87.8 F1-score and 4.98% CER with minimal additional pre or post-processing of

problems in query optimization. Neither classical nor learning-based methods
yield satisfactory performance when estimating the cardinality of the join
queries. They either rely on simplified assumptions leading to ineffective
cardinality estimates or build large models to understand the data
distributions, leading to long planning times and a lack of generalizability
across queries.
  In this paper, we propose a new framework FactorJoin for estimating join
queries. FactorJoin combines the idea behind the classical join-histogram
method to efficiently handle joins with the learning-based methods to
accurately capture attribute correlation. Specifically, FactorJoin scans every
table in a DB and builds single-table conditional distributions during an
offline preparation phase. When a join query comes, FactorJoin translates it
into a factor graph model over the learned distributions to effectively and
efficiently estimate its cardinality.
  Unlike existing learning-based methods, FactorJoin does not need to
de-normalize joins upfront or require executed query workloads to train the
model. Since it only relies on single-table statistics, FactorJoin has small
space overhead and is extremely easy to train and maintain. In our evaluation,
FactorJoin can produce more effective estimates than the previous
state-of-the-art learning-based methods, with 40x less estimation latency, 100x
smaller model size, and 100x faster training speed at comparable or better
accuracy. In addition, FactorJoin can estimate 10,000 sub-plan queries within
one second to optimize the query plan, which is very close to the traditional
cardinality estimators in commercial DBMS.

This contribution formulates the MPC tuning task as a multi-objective

MPC-parameterizations are evaluated on an computationally expensive simulation
environment. As a result, the used optimization algorithm needs to be as
sampleefficient as possible. Second, for some poor parameterizations the
simulation cannot be completed and therefore useful objective function values
are not available (learning with crash constraints). In this contribution, we
compare the sample efficiency of multi-objective particle swarm optimization
(MOPSO), a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multiple versions of Bayesian
optimization (BO). We extend BO, by introducing an adaptive batch size to limit
the computational overhead and by a method on how to deal with crash
constraints. Results show, that BO works best for a small budget, NSGA-II is
best for medium budgets and for large budgets none of the evaluated optimizers
is superior to random search. Both proposed BO extensions are shown to be
beneficial.

is capable of detecting objects at record-breaking redshifts, $z \gtrsim 15$.
This is a crucial advance for observational cosmology, as at these redshifts
the differences between alternative cosmological models manifest themselves in
the most obvious way. In recent years, some observational hints have emerged
indicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require correcting. One
of these hints is related to the discovery of remote galaxies whose redshifts
correspond to the very young Universe (less than one billion years after the
Big Bang) but which are similar to nearby galaxies. The issue is that such
galaxies in the early Universe do not have enough time to evolve into something
similar to the late-Universe galaxies. JWST observations of high-redshift
objects are expected to shed light on the origin of this issue. Here we provide
results on performing the ``angular diameter -- redshift'' cosmological test
for the first JWST observation data. We compare this result with predictions of
the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and some static cosmological
models, including Zwicky's ``tired-light'' model. The latter is currently
assumed to be ruled out by observations. We challenge this assumption and show
that a static model can provide a natural and straightforward way of solving
the puzzle of the well-evolved galaxies and better agreements with the results
of the JWST ``angular diameter -- redshift'' test at higher redshifts than the
correcting evolution model within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We discuss
several cosmological tests that will be important for further research on the
possibility of revising the expanding Universe paradigm.

with MSE (or MAE) as the loss function, assuming that residuals/errors follow
independent and isotropic Gaussian (or Laplacian) distribution for simplicity.
However, this assumption rarely holds for real-world traffic forecasting tasks,
where the unexplained residuals are often correlated in both space and time. In
this study, we propose Spatiotemporal Residual Regularization by modeling
residuals with a dynamic (e.g., time-varying) mixture of zero-mean multivariate
Gaussian distribution with learnable spatiotemporal covariance matrices. This
approach allows us to directly capture spatiotemporally correlated residuals.
For scalability, we model the spatiotemporal covariance for each mixture
component using a Kronecker product structure, which significantly reduces the
number of parameters and computation complexity. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed method on a traffic speed forecasting task. Our results show that,
by properly modeling residual distribution, the proposed method not only
improves the model performance but also provides interpretable structures.

the potential $\Phi(R) = 4/9$ and black hole by $\Phi(R) = 1/2$, where $\Phi(R)
= (MR-Q^2/2)/(R^2+a^2)$ for Kerr-Newman charged and rotating object. It turns
out that in terms of gravitational and non-gravitational energy, the former is
defined when gravitational energy is half of non-gravitational energy while the
latter when the two are equal. If an infinitely dispersed system of bare mass
$M$ collapses under its own gravity to radius $R$, total energy inside would be
$E_{tot}(R)=M-E_{grav}(R)$. That is, energy inside is increased by the amount
equivalent to gravitational energy which may manifest as internal or binding
energy. If the interior consists of free particles in motion interacting only
through gravity (as is the case for Vlasov kinetic matter), then internal
(gravitational) energy would be kinetic energy and the defining condition for
Buchdahl star would be kinetic energy equal to half of non-gravitational
(potential) energy. It could then be construed that equilibrium of Buchdahl
star interior is governed by the celebrated Virial theorem (kinetic energy
equal to half of potential energy). Thus it could be thought of as a Virial

main exception of article citation rates in chemistry. Thus, introducing
journal or article level citation information into peer review exercises may
have a regression to the mean effect. Bibliometric scoring slightly advantaged
women compared to men, but this varied between UoAs and was most evident in the

the peer review scores are correct. This is almost a paradox: although high

critical concern for brokers, since traditional rule-based strategies are
relatively static that cannot achieve a lower transaction cost in a dynamic
market. Many studies have tried to minimize the cost via reinforcement
learning, but there are bottlenecks in improvement, especially for
long-duration strategies such as the VWAP strategy. To address this issue, we
propose a deep learning and hierarchical reinforcement learning jointed
architecture termed Macro-Meta-Micro Trader (M3T) to capture market patterns
and execute orders from different temporal scales. The Macro Trader first
allocates a parent order into tranches based on volume profiles as the
traditional VWAP strategy does, but a long short-term memory neural network is
used to improve the forecasting accuracy. Then the Meta Trader selects a
short-term subgoal appropriate to instant liquidity within each tranche to form
a mini-tranche. The Micro Trader consequently extracts the instant market state
and fulfils the subgoal with the lowest transaction cost. Our experiments over
stocks listed on the Shanghai stock exchange demonstrate that our approach
outperforms baselines in terms of VWAP slippage, with an average cost saving of
1.16 base points compared to the optimal baseline.

attenuation due to multiple scattering by dust particles on the THz beam
propagation path. Scattering models are developed for beams through dust, based
on Mie and Rayleigh approximations for corresponding frequencies for Earth
(0.24 THz) and Mars (1.64 THz). The simulation results are compared,
considering parameters such as the number of Monte-Carlo photon (MCP) packets,
visibility, dust particle placement density along the beam, frequency, and
distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Moreover, a channel capacity
model was proposed, considering THz link attenuation due to dust storms,
spreading loss and molecular absorption loss for Earth and Mars outdoor
environments. Simulation results for Earth show that link attenuation increases
with dust particle placement density, distance and frequency, and attenuation
decreases with visibility. On Mars, similar results are obtained, except that
the attenuation is variate around a constant value with the frequency increase.
Channel capacity is estimated for Earth and Mars environments considering time
and distance-dependent scenarios. Time windows that show a sudden drop of dust
particles along the beam provide opportunities to communicate with high
reliability. Moreover, increasing the distance between the transmitter and
receiver severely reduces the channel capacity measurement in strong dust storm
conditions in both environments. Our study has found that weak dust storms have
relatively little effect on Mars, but much larger effects on Earth.

Accordingly, the unique linkage of a memory chip and a logical node can be
promising to resolve the root-of-trust problem on the Internet-of-Things. For
this aim, we propose a protocol of challenge-response using a memory chip. For
the central management, a central node controls the entry of electronic
appliances with a memory chip into the network, and excludes a fake node (e.g.,
the spoofing entity) from the network that the central node manages. For the
decentralized communications, Merkle's tree turns out to be composed of memory
chips to which the logical nodes are uniquely linked, respectively. The root of
Merkle turns out to be the memory chip that stores the latest record of data
transactions. We can register this memory chip as a new block by satisfying the
requirement of the proof-of-consensus. After blocks are chained, it gets harder
for even the central node to manipulate transaction record among memory chips.
By this way, the decentralized system (e.g., blockchain) and the central
management can coexist. A new idea of security state is also discussed briefly.

  Systems","30 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In this paper, the effective capacity of cooperative communication (CC)
systems with hybrid Automatic repeat request (HARQ) is derived. The derived
expressions are valid for any channel distribution and with any arbitrary
number of retransmissions by the source and relay for both HARQ-repetition
redundancy (RR) and HARQ-incremental redundancy (IR) over asymmetric channels.
As an example, we use the derived EC expression over Rayleigh fading channels.
Several results are obtained for a low rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We
can see that the EC attends its maximum value with a small number of
retransmissions. As expected when the relay-destination channel has low SNR, it
is better than the relay does not participate especially when we assign a large
number of transitions at the relay. For high data rates and strict quality of
service (QoS) constraints, it is better to increase the number of relay
transmissions. Finally, when we increase the number of source retransmissions,
the effective capacity improves even for low values.
