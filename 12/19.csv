Surface (RIS) adapts its phase shift response to enhance or attenuate channel
strength in specific directions. In this paper, we show how those two seemingly
different technologies (and their derivatives) can be unified into a single
architecture called RIScatter. RIScatter consists of multiple dispersed or
co-located scatter nodes, whose reflection states are adapted to partially
modulate their own information and partially engineer the wireless channel. The
key principle is to render the probability distribution of reflection states as
a joint function of the information source, Channel State Information (CSI),
and Quality of Service (QoS) of coexisting active primary and passive
backscatter links. This enables RIScatter to softly bridge BackCom and RIS;
boil down to either under specific input distribution; or evolve in a mixed

the benefits of RIScatter, we also propose a co-located Successive Interference

primary link. For a single-user multi-node RIScatter network, we characterize
the achievable primary-(total-)backscatter rate region by designing the input

RIScatter nodes can exploit the scattered paths to smoothly shift between

president, politician) of a given entity mention (e.g., Joe Biden) in context.
State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods use the cross-encoder (CE) based architecture.
CE concatenates the mention (and its context) with each type and feeds the
pairs into a pretrained language model (PLM) to score their relevance. It
brings deeper interaction between mention and types to reach better performance
but has to perform N (type set size) forward passes to infer types of a single
mention. CE is therefore very slow in inference when the type set is large
(e.g., N = 10k for UFET). To this end, we propose to perform entity typing in a
recall-expand-filter manner. The recall and expand stages prune the large type
set and generate K (K is typically less than 256) most relevant type candidates
for each mention. At the filter stage, we use a novel model called MCCE to
concurrently encode and score these K candidates in only one forward pass to
obtain the final type prediction. We investigate different variants of MCCE and
extensive experiments show that MCCE under our paradigm reaches SOTA
performance on ultra-fine entity typing and is thousands of times faster than
the cross-encoder. We also found MCCE is very effective in fine-grained (130

The first algorithm is developed for balanced design without missing

running short Markov chains and then samples the model parameters of variance
components and regression coefficients at each MCMC iteration. We provide
theoretical guarantee by showing the convergence of the output distribution

fits a self-consistent chemical-evolution and star-formation model directly to
the MaNGA spectra. We model the galaxies' inner and outer regions assuming that
some of the material lost in stellar winds falls inwards. We also incorporate
chemical enrichment from type II and Ia supernovae to follow the alpha-element
abundance at different metallicities and locations. We find some MWAs where the
stellar properties closely reproduce the distribution of age, metallicity, and
alpha enhancement at both small and large radii in the MW. In these systems,
the match is driven by the longer timescale for star formation in the outer
parts, and the inflow of enriched material to the central parts. However, other
MWAs have very different histories. These divide into two categories:
self-similar galaxies where the inner and outer parts evolve identically; and
centrally-quenched galaxies where there is very little evidence of late-time
central star formation driven by material accreted from the outer regions. We
find that, although selected to be comparable, there are subtle morphological

ramps which are either rigidly propagating in time or stationary, we rigorously
establish existence and stability of positive, monotone fronts and give leading
order expansions for their interface location. For non-zero ramp speeds, and
sufficiently small ramp slopes, the front location is determined by the local
transition between convective and absolute instability of the base state and
leads to an O(1) delay beyond the instantaneous pitchfork location before the
system jumps to a nontrivial state. The slow ramp induces a further delay of
the interface controlled by a slow-passage through a fold of strong- and
weak-stable eigenspaces of the associated linearization. We introduce
projective coordinates to de-singularize the dynamics near the trivial state

use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to locate the
desired intersection of invariant manifolds. For stationary ramps, the front is
governed by the slow passage through the instantaneous pitchfork bifurcation
with inner expansion given by the unique Hastings-McLeod connecting solution of
Painlev\'{e}'s second equation. We once again use geometric singular
perturbation theory and blow-up to track invariant manifolds into a
neighborhood of the non-hyperbolic point where the ramp passes through zero and

followed to obtain fast power reference response in power systems. For this

first level consists of the decentralized control of each rotor unit. By using
an LPV formalism, it is shown how the nonlinearities of the controlled system

by considering two different Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) datasets: a
complete Planck, and a second one primarily based on SPTPol and Planck
temperature ($l<1000$). We contrast the effects of allowing the
phenomenological lensing amplitude ($\Al$) to be different from unity. We find
that the fraction of early dark energy, while not immediately affected by the
lensing anomaly, can induce mild deviations, through correlations with the
parameters $H_0$ and $S_8$. {We extend the analysis also by marginalizing the
Newtonian lensing potential, finding a $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ deviation, when
allowing for an amplitude rescaling and scale-dependence. Modeling the
rescaling of the theory lensing potential and the acoustic smoothing of the CMB
spectra, we find that only to a moderate level the anomaly can be addressed by
modifying the lensing signal itself and that an additional $\Al \sim 1.1$ at
$\sim 2\sigma$ significance should be addressed by pre-recombination physics.
Finally, we also comment on the lensing anomaly in a non-flat ($\Omega_{\rm k}

robust and not correlated with the additional smoothing in the CMB spectra.

to the spectral curves, known as the Robin-Neumann gap and the spectral flow.
We show that these quantities hold information about the the spectral curves,
the behavior of the corresponding eigenfunctions, and the geometry of the graph
itself. For a specific subset of the $\delta_s$ family which is known as the
$\delta$ family, we study the Robin-Neumann gap, which measures the total
increase in the eigenvalues with respect to the perturbation parameter. We use
this quantity to show that the growth of the spectral curves is uniformly
bounded, and that on average it is linear, with proportionality factor
determined by the geometry of the graph. For the general $\delta_s$ family of
vertex conditions, we study a quantity known as the spectral flow, which counts
the number of oriented intersections of the spectral curves with some given
horizontal cross section. We use this quantity to prove an index theorem which
connects between a generalized nodal deficiency of the eigenfunctions and the
stability index of a generalized Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We also show that

  Case Study on Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) energy management strategy (EMS) is
considered a promising solution for the energy management of electric vehicles
with multiple power sources. It has been shown to outperform conventional
methods in energy management problems regarding energy-saving and real-time
performance. However, previous studies have not systematically examined the
essential elements of RL-based EMS. This paper presents an empirical analysis
of RL-based EMS in a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) and Fuel Cell
Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The empirical analysis is developed in four aspects:
algorithm, perception and decision granularity, hyperparameters, and reward
function. The results show that the Off-policy algorithm effectively develops a
more fuel-efficient solution within the complete driving cycle compared with
other algorithms. Improving the perception and decision granularity does not
produce a more desirable energy-saving solution but better balances battery
power and fuel consumption. The equivalent energy optimization objective based
on the instantaneous state of charge (SOC) variation is parameter sensitive and
can help RL-EMSs to achieve more efficient energy-cost strategies.

high stakes applications, faithful and robust explanations are important to
understand and gain trust in DNN classifiers. However, recent work has shown
that state-of-the-art attribution methods in text classifiers are susceptible
to imperceptible adversarial perturbations that alter explanations
significantly while maintaining the correct prediction outcome. If undetected,
this can critically mislead the users of DNNs. Thus, it is crucial to
understand the influence of such adversarial perturbations on the networks'
explanations and their perceptibility. In this work, we establish a novel
definition of attribution robustness (AR) in text classification, based on
Lipschitz continuity. Crucially, it reflects both attribution change induced by
adversarial input alterations and perceptibility of such alterations. Moreover,
we introduce a wide set of text similarity measures to effectively capture
locality between two text samples and imperceptibility of adversarial
perturbations in text. We then propose our novel TransformerExplanationAttack
(TEA), a strong adversary that provides a tight estimation for attribution
robustness in text classification. TEA uses state-of-the-art language models to
extract word substitutions that result in fluent, contextual adversarial
samples. Finally, with experiments on several text classification
architectures, we show that TEA consistently outperforms current
state-of-the-art AR estimators, yielding perturbations that alter explanations
to a greater extent while being more fluent and less perceptible.

reprocessing of stellar radiation and in balancing the heating and cooling
processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), but appear to be destroyed in HII
regions. However, the mechanisms driving their destruction are still not
completely understood. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-MUSE observations, we
investigate how the PAH fraction changes in about 1500 HII regions across four
nearby star-forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1365, NGC 7496, IC 5332). We find a
strong anti-correlation between the PAH fraction and the ionization parameter
(the ratio between the ionizing photon flux and the hydrogen density) of HII
regions. This relation becomes steeper for more luminous HII regions. The
metallicity of HII regions has only a minor impact on these results in our
galaxy sample. We find that the PAH fraction decreases with the H$\alpha$
equivalent width - a proxy for the age of the HII regions - although this trend
is much weaker than the one identified using the ionization parameter. Our
results are consistent with a scenario where hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation is
the dominant source of PAH destruction in star-forming regions.

that the time delays can be recovered with an accuracy of 5 and 15% for light

strongly on the redshift of the source and the relative contribution of the

reminiscent of non-star-forming disks in early type galaxies and likely fed by
gas inflow triggered by stellar feedback in the lanes. The lanes host a large
number of JWST-identified massive young star clusters. We find some evidence

the gas lanes reveal strong streaming motions and may be consistent with
convergence of gas streamlines expected there. Indeed, the extreme line-widths

been recently proposed as a way to probe Kondo lattice physics and to gain
insight into how the two extremes of localized and delocalized electron states
interact (Sunko, et al, Science advances 6, 2020). Although high harmonic
generation has been used extensively to investigate the gas phase, its
extension to solids is relatively recent, and has not yet been applied to
interfaces. Here, we investigate the field-induced dielectric break-down at the
Mott-insulator/metal interface using high harmonic generation, emitted when the
interface is subjected to an ultrafast laser pulse. We show that the intensity
of high harmonic emission correlates closely with doublon production and the
corresponding loss of short-range anti-ferromagnetic order. For strong
interlayer coupling, the harmonic intensity is defined by a phase transition
between states that do not exist in a pure Mott insulator case. For weak
interlayer coupling, the threshold for dielectric breakdown is considerably
lowered due to the presence of a metallic layer. This suggests that interlayer
coupling can be used as an additional knob to control magnetic insulator
break-down, with implications for using Mott insulators as memristors in
neuromorphic circuits.

node compartments. These structures serve for active or diffusion transport of
proteins. Examples are glial networks in the brain, the endoplasmic reticulum
in cells or dendritic spines located on dendrites. In this latter case, a large
ball forming the head is connected by a narrow passage. In all cases, how the
transport of molecules, ions or proteins is regulated determines the time scale
of chemical reactions or signal transduction. In the present study, based on
modeling diffusion in three dimensions, we compute the mean time for a Brownian
particle to reach a narrow target inside such a composite network made of
tubules connected to spherical nodes. We derive asymptotic formulas by solving
a mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary value problem with small Dirichlet part. We
first consider the case of a network domain organized in a 2-D lattice
structure that consists of spherical ball compartments connected via narrow
cylindrical passages. When there is a single target we derive a matrix equation
for each Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) averaged over each spherical
compartment. We then consider a composite domain consisting of a spherical
head-like domain connected to a large cylinder via a narrow cylindrical neck.
For Brownian particles starting within the narrow neck, we derive formulas for
the MFPT to reach a target on the spherical head. When diffusing particles can
be absorbed upon hitting additional absorbing boundaries of the large cylinder,
we compute the probability and conditional MFPT to reach a target. We compare
these formulas with numerical solutions of the mixed boundary value problem and
with Brownian simulations. To conclude, the present analysis reveals that the
mean arrival time, driven by diffusion in heterogeneous networks, is controlled
by the target and narrow passage sizes.

we find that mean estimates from existing heteroscedastic solutions can be

whether human cognitive capacities might emerge in such generic models given
sufficient training data. Of particular interest is the ability of these models

Here, we performed a direct comparison between human reasoners and a large

been established to be a likely scenario for the build up of nuclear stellar
clusters (NSCs). A remaining issue is whether strong external tidal
perturbation may lead to the severe disruption of loosely-bound clusters well
before they sink deeply into the center of their host galaxies. We carry out a
series of $N$-body simulations and verify our early idealized analytic models.
We show if the density profile of the host galaxies can be described by a
power-law distribution with an index, $\alpha <1$, the cluster would be
compressed in the radial direction by the external galactic tidal field. In
contrast, the galactic tidal perturbation is disruptive in regions with a
steep, $\alpha >1$, density fall-off or in the very center where gravity is
dominated by the point-mass potential of super-massive black holes (SMBHs).
This sufficient criterion supplements the conventional necessary
Roche-lobe-filling condition in determining the preservation versus
disintegration of satellite stellar systems. We simulate the disruption of
stellar clusters which venture on nearly-circular, modestly- or
highly-eccentric orbits into the center of galaxies with a range of background
density profiles and SMBHs. We obtain the spatial distribution of the
stellar-cluster remnants. We apply these results to the NSC within a few
parsecs from SMBH Sgr A$^\ast$ at the Galactic Center. Recent observations
indicate the coexistence of two populations of stars with distinctively
separate ages and metallicities. We verify that the subsolar-metalicity

representation is to convert pixel intensities and their coordinates i.e. state
label preparation using quantum bits i.e. Qubits. For a bigger size image, the
state label preparation takes more Qubits. To address more Qubits issues, a
novel SCMNEQR (State Connection Modification Novel Enhanced Quantum

arbitrary size of the grayscale image using block-wise state label preparation.
The proposed SCMNEQR approach introduces the state connection using a reset

implementation in an emerging field exposes them to significant technology
risk. Selecting the wrong implementation could expose an organization to
security vulnerabilities, reduce access to its target audience, or cause issues
in the future when switching to a more mature protocol. Blockchain
interoperability aims to solve this adaptability problem by increasing the
extensibility of blockchain, enabling the addition of new use cases and
features without sacrificing the performance of the original blockchain.
However, most existing blockchain platforms need to be designed for
interoperability, and simple operations like sending assets across platforms
create problems. Cryptographic protocols that are secure in isolation may
become insecure when several different (individually secure) protocols are
composed. Similarly, utilizing trusted custodians may undercut most of the
benefits of decentralization offered by blockchain-based systems. Even though
there is some research and development in the field of blockchain
interoperability, a characterization of the interoperability solutions for
various infrastructure options is lacking. This paper presents a methodology
for characterizing blockchain interoperability solutions that will help focus

of interaction forces. This study presents a high-level framework for
simultaneous trajectory optimization and force control of the interaction
between a manipulator and soft environments, which is prone to external
disturbances. Sliding friction and normal contact force are taken into account.
The dynamics of the soft contact model and the manipulator are simultaneously
incorporated in a trajectory optimizer to generate desired motion and force
profiles. A constrained optimization framework based on Alternative Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has been employed to efficiently generate
real-time optimal control inputs and high-dimensional state trajectories in a
Model Predictive Control fashion. Experimental validation of the model
performance is conducted on a soft substrate with known material properties
using a Cartesian space force control mode. Results show a comparison of ground
truth and real-time model-based contact force and motion tracking for multiple
Cartesian motions in the valid range of the friction model. It is shown that a
contact model-based motion planner can compensate for frictional forces and
motion disturbances and improve the overall motion and force tracking accuracy.
The proposed high-level planner has the potential to facilitate the automation

$(U_d,V_d)$ with joint distribution $P_{U_d,V_d}$, such that $P_{U_d,V_d}$
converges in total variation distance to a target distribution $Q_{U,V}$ as the
input blocklength $d$ is taken to be asymptotically large. Inner and outer
bounds are obtained on the set of distributions $Q_{U,V}$ which can be produced
given an input distribution $P_{X,Y}$. To this end, a bijective mapping from
the set of distributions $Q_{U,V}$ to a union of star-convex sets is provided.
By leveraging proof techniques from discrete Fourier analysis along with a
novel randomized rounding technique, inner and outer bounds are derived for
each of these star-convex sets, and by inverting the aforementioned bijective
mapping, necessary and sufficient conditions on $Q_{U,V}$ and $P_{X,Y}$ are
provided under which $Q_{U,V}$ can be produced from $P_{X,Y}$. The bounds are
applicable in NISS scenarios where the output alphabets $\mathcal{U}$ and
$\mathcal{V}$ have arbitrary finite size. In case of binary output alphabets,
the outer-bound recovers the previously best-known outer-bound.

  digital twin for dynamical systems",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A framework for creating and updating digital twins for dynamical systems
from a library of physics-based functions is proposed. The sparse Bayesian
machine learning is used to update and derive an interpretable expression for
the digital twin. Two approaches for updating the digital twin are proposed.
The first approach makes use of both the input and output information from a
dynamical system, whereas the second approach utilizes output-only observations
to update the digital twin. Both methods use a library of candidate functions
representing certain physics to infer new perturbation terms in the existing
digital twin model. In both cases, the resulting expressions of updated digital
twins are identical, and in addition, the epistemic uncertainties are
quantified. In the first approach, the regression problem is derived from a
state-space model, whereas in the latter case, the output-only information is
treated as a stochastic process. The concepts of It\^o calculus and
Kramers-Moyal expansion are being utilized to derive the regression equation.
The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated using highly
nonlinear dynamical systems such as the crack-degradation problem. Numerical
results demonstrated in this paper almost exactly identify the correct
perturbation terms along with their associated parameters in the dynamical
system. The probabilistic nature of the proposed approach also helps in
quantifying the uncertainties associated with updated models. The proposed
approaches provide an exact and explainable description of the perturbations in
digital twin models, which can be directly used for better cyber-physical
integration, long-term future predictions, degradation monitoring, and
model-agnostic control.

various demands. Users' demands are related to their backgrounds and robots

different from the usual to a user, the robot-specific software has to be
changed. On the other hand, robot-software developers would like to reuse their
developed software as much as possible to reduce their efforts. We propose the
system design considering hardware-level reusability. For this purpose, we
begin with the learning-from-observation framework. This framework represents a
target task in robot-agnostic representation, and thus the represented task
description can be shared with various robots. When executing the task, it is
necessary to convert the robot-agnostic description into commands of a target
robot. To increase the reusability, first, we implement the skill library,
robot motion primitives, only considering a robot hand and we regarded that a
robot was just a carrier to move the hand on the target trajectory. The skill
library is reusable if we would like to the same robot hand. Second, we employ
the generic IK solver to quickly swap a robot. We verify the hardware-level
reusability by applying two task descriptions to two different robots, Nextage

smaller language models (e.g., GPT-2) win over models that are orders of
magnitude larger and better (e.g., GPT-3), if powered with novel commonsense

commonsense knowledge, focusing on the task of generating generics, statements
of commonsense facts about everyday concepts, e.g., birds can fly.
  We introduce I2D2, a novel commonsense distillation framework that loosely

dependence on the extreme-scale teacher model with two innovations: (1) the
novel adaptation of NeuroLogic Decoding to enhance the generation quality of
the weak, off-the-shelf language models, and (2) self-imitation learning to
iteratively learn from the model's own enhanced commonsense acquisition
capabilities. Empirical results suggest that scale is not the only way, as

domain where the first-order projected gradient descent (PGD) is used as the
benchmark approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness evaluation,
there lacks a principled first-order gradient-based robustness evaluation
framework in NLP. The emerging optimization challenges lie in 1) the discrete
nature of textual inputs together with the strong coupling between the
perturbation location and the actual content, and 2) the additional constraint
that the perturbed text should be fluent and achieve a low perplexity under a
language model. These challenges make the development of PGD-like NLP attacks
difficult. To bridge the gap, we propose TextGrad, a new attack generator using
gradient-driven optimization, supporting high-accuracy and high-quality
assessment of adversarial robustness in NLP. Specifically, we address the
aforementioned challenges in a unified optimization framework. And we develop
an effective convex relaxation method to co-optimize the continuously-relaxed
site selection and perturbation variables and leverage an effective sampling
method to establish an accurate mapping from the continuous optimization
variables to the discrete textual perturbations. Moreover, as a first-order
attack generation method, TextGrad can be baked into adversarial training to
further improve the robustness of NLP models. Extensive experiments are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGrad not only in attack
generation for robustness evaluation but also in adversarial defense.

determine if specific frames of a video contain abnormal behaviors. However,
video anomaly detection is particularly context-specific, and the availability
of representative datasets heavily limits real-world accuracy. Additionally,
the metrics currently reported by most state-of-the-art methods often do not
reflect how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios. In this
article, we present the Charlotte Anomaly Dataset (CHAD). CHAD is a
high-resolution, multi-camera anomaly dataset in a commercial parking lot
setting. In addition to frame-level anomaly labels, CHAD is the first anomaly
dataset to include bounding box, identity, and pose annotations for each actor.
This is especially beneficial for skeleton-based anomaly detection, which is
useful for its lower computational demand in real-world settings. CHAD is also
the first anomaly dataset to contain multiple views of the same scene. With
four camera views and over 1.15 million frames, CHAD is the largest fully
annotated anomaly detection dataset including person annotations, collected
from continuous video streams from stationary cameras for smart video
surveillance applications. To demonstrate the efficacy of CHAD for training and
evaluation, we benchmark two state-of-the-art skeleton-based anomaly detection
algorithms on CHAD and provide comprehensive analysis, including both
quantitative results and qualitative examination. The dataset is available at
https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/CHAD.

where continuous and integer variables should be optimized simultaneously. The
CMA-ES, our focus in this study, is a population-based stochastic search method
that samples solution candidates from a multivariate Gaussian distribution
(MGD), which shows excellent performance in continuous BBO. The parameters of
MGD, mean and (co)variance, are updated based on the evaluation value of
candidate solutions in the CMA-ES. If the CMA-ES is applied to the MI-BBO with
straightforward discretization, however, the variance corresponding to the
integer variables becomes much smaller than the granularity of the
discretization before reaching the optimal solution, which leads to the
stagnation of the optimization. In particular, when binary variables are
included in the problem, this stagnation more likely occurs because the
granularity of the discretization becomes wider, and the existing modification
to the CMA-ES does not address this stagnation. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a simple extension of the CMA-ES based on lower-bounding the
marginal probabilities associated with the generation of integer variables in
the MGD. The numerical experiments on the MI-BBO benchmark problems demonstrate
the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore, in order to
demonstrate the generality of the idea of the proposed method, in addition to
the single-objective optimization case, we incorporate it into multi-objective
CMA-ES and verify its performance on bi-objective mixed-integer benchmark

Out-Of-Domain (OOD) areas (e.g., background, accessories) in the image.
Detecting the OOD areas beyond the generation ability of the pre-trained model
and blending these regions with the input image can enhance fidelity. The
""invertibility mask"" figures out these OOD areas, and existing methods predict
the mask with the reconstruction error. However, the estimated mask is usually
inaccurate due to the influence of the reconstruction error in the In-Domain
(ID) area. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances the
fidelity of human face inversion by designing a new module to decompose the
input images to ID and OOD partitions with invertibility masks. Unlike previous
works, our invertibility detector is simultaneously learned with a spatial
alignment module. We iteratively align the generated features to the input
geometry and reduce the reconstruction error in the ID regions. Thus, the OOD
areas are more distinguishable and can be precisely predicted. Then, we improve
the fidelity of our results by blending the OOD areas from the input image with
the ID GAN inversion results. Our method produces photo-realistic results for
real-world human face image inversion and manipulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superiority over existing methods in the quality of
GAN inversion and attribute manipulation.

the largest, which suggests that similarly to previous VHE GRBs, the jet
opening angle is so small that the collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy is
nominal. Afterglow emission from such a narrow jet decays too rapidly,
especially if the jet propagates into uniform circumburst material. In the
two-component jet model, another wide jet component with a smaller Lorentz

images for this purpose. Predicting the height of the buildings using only RGB
images is challenging due to the insufficient amount of data, low data quality,
variations of building types, different angles of light and shadow, etc. In
this study, we present an instance segmentation-based building height
extraction method to predict building masks with their respective heights from
a single RGB satellite image. We used satellite images with building height
annotations of certain cities along with an open-source satellite dataset with
the transfer learning approach. We reached, the bounding box mAP 59, the mask
mAP 52.6, and the average accuracy value of 70% for buildings belonging to each
height class in our test set.

  We show that $\mathcal{F}$ has at least $k$ abundant elements if $k \geq n -

this paper, we want to design a novel high-accuracy COVID-19 detection method
that uses CXR images, which can consider the unique features of COVID-19 and
the similar features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia. Methods: Our method
consists of two phases. One is self-supervised learning-based pertaining; the
other is batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning. Self-supervised
learning-based pretraining can learn distinguished representations from CXR
images without manually annotated labels. On the other hand, batch knowledge
ensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category knowledge of images in a
batch according to their visual feature similarities to improve detection
performance. Unlike our previous implementation, we introduce batch knowledge
ensembling into the fine-tuning phase, reducing the memory used in
self-supervised learning and improving COVID-19 detection accuracy. Results: On
two public COVID-19 CXR datasets, namely, a large dataset and an unbalanced

reasoning ability of language models require complex processing of training
data (e.g., aligning symbolic knowledge to text), yielding task-specific data
augmentation solutions that restrict the learning of general logical reasoning
skills. In this work, we propose APOLLO, an adaptively pretrained language
model that has improved logical reasoning abilities. We select a subset of
Wikipedia, based on a set of logical inference keywords, for continued
pretraining of a language model. We use two self-supervised loss functions: a
modified masked language modeling loss where only specific parts-of-speech
words, that would likely require more reasoning than basic language
understanding, are masked, and a sentence-level classification loss that
teaches the model to distinguish between entailment and contradiction types of
sentences. The proposed training paradigm is both simple and independent of
task formats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of APOLLO by comparing it with
prior baselines on two logical reasoning datasets. APOLLO performs comparably
on ReClor and outperforms baselines on LogiQA. The code base has been made

We demonstrate the influence of 18 Indian languages on IE by comparing the

Consequently, we are able to validate the intuitions of Indian language

(3) the advantages and caveats of each type of algorithm are discussed.
Secondly, the classification performance of different algorithms on the unified

and SDSS survey. Six groups of spectral data sets are designed from data
characteristics, data qualities and data volumes to examine the performance of
these algorithms. Then the scores of nine basic algorithms are shown and
discussed in the experimental analysis. Finally, nine basic algorithms source

However, less attention has been paid to privacy requirements refinement based

For privacy related reviews identification, Gradient Boosting classifier
achieves the highest F1 score of 93.77\% among other competitive algorithms

bird's eye view (BEV) without pre-given camera calibration. This is a very
challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different
first-person views (FPVs) for a multi-person scene, without the BEV image and
the calibration of the FPVs, while the output is a unified plane with the
localization and orientation of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. We
propose an end-to-end framework solving this problem, whose main idea can be
divided into following parts: i) creating a view-transform subject detection
module to transform the FPV to a virtual BEV including localization and
orientation of each pedestrian, ii) deriving a geometric transformation based
method to estimate camera localization and view direction, i.e., the camera
registration in a unified BEV, iii) making use of spatial and appearance
information to aggregate the subjects into the unified BEV. We collect a new
large-scale synthetic dataset with rich annotations for evaluation. The
experimental results show the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method.

We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no
global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral
climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR
subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect.
First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax
because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net
carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their
carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net
carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when
marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from
carbon exporters.

splitting method reaches the first-order accuracy by losing two spatial
derivatives. In this paper, we propose a modified splitting method for the 1D
cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation: \begin{align*}
u^{n+1}=\mathrm{e}^{i\frac\tau2\partial_x^2}{\mathcal N}_\tau
\left[\mathrm{e}^{i\frac\tau2\partial_x^2}\big(\Pi_\tau +\mathrm{e}^{-2\pi
i\lambda M_0\tau}\Pi^\tau \big)u^n\right], \end{align*} with ${\mathcal
N}_t(\phi)=\mathrm{e}^{-i\lambda t|\Pi_\tau\phi|^2}\phi,$ and $M_0$ is the mass
of the initial data. Suitably choosing the filters $\Pi_\tau$ and $\Pi^\tau$,
it is shown rigorously that it reaches the first-order accuracy by only losing
$\frac32$-spatial derivatives. Moreover, if $\gamma\in (0,1)$, the new method
presents the convergence rate of $\tau^{\frac{4\gamma}{4+\gamma}}$ in
$L^2$-norm for the $H^\gamma$-data; if $\gamma\in [1,2]$, it presents the
convergence rate of $\tau^{\frac25(1+\gamma)-}$ in $L^2$-norm for the
$H^\gamma$-data. %In particular, the regularity requirement of the initial data
for the first-order convergence in $L^2$-norm is only $H^{\frac32+}$. These
results are better than the expected ones for the standard (filtered) Strang
splitting methods. Moreover, the mass is conserved: $$\frac1{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb
T} |u^n(x)|^2\,d x\equiv M_0, \quad n=0,1,\ldots, L . $$ The key idea is based
on the observation that the low frequency and high frequency components of
solutions are almost separated (up to some smooth components). Then the
algorithm is constructed by tracking the solution behavior at the low and high
frequency components separately.

of the upper limb movements are located by the external limb trajectory to
eliminate the delay and bias among the trials. However, the trajectories are

performance, which limits the further application of upper limb movements in
the brain-computer interface. This work focuses on multi-channel brain signals
analysis in the temporal-frequency approach. It proposes the two-stage-training
temporal-spectral neural network (TTSNet) to decode patterns from brain
signals. The TTSNet first divides the signals into various filter banks. In
each filter bank, task-related component analysis is used to reduce the
dimension and reject the noise of the brain. A convolutional neural network
(CNN) is then used to optimize the temporal characteristic of signals and
extract class-related features. Finally, these class-related features from all
filter banks are fused by concatenation and classified by the fully connected
layer of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in two public datasets. The
results show that TTSNet has an improved accuracy of 0.7456$\pm$0.1205 compared

function (CMF) and thus potentially on the IMF. The ALMA-IMF Large Program aims
to investigate the variations in the core distributions with cloud
characteristics, as diagnostic observables of the formation process and
evolution of clouds. The present study focuses on the W43-MM2&MM3
mini-starburst, whose CMF has recently been found to be top-heavy with respect
to the Salpeter slope. W43-MM2&MM3 harbors a rich cluster that contains a
statistically significant number of cores, which was previously characterized
in Paper III. We applied a multi-scale decomposition technique to the ALMA 1.3
mm and 3 mm continuum images to define six subregions. For each subregion we
characterized the high column density probability distribution function, n-PDF,
and the shape of the cloud gas using the 1.3 mm image. Using the core catalog,
we investigate correlations between the CMF and cloud and core properties. We
classify the subregions into different stages of evolution, from quiescent to
burst to post-burst, based on the surface number density of cores, number of
outflows, and UCHii presence. The high-mass end of the subregion CMFs varies
from being close to the Salpeter slope (quiescent) to top-heavy (burst and
post-burst). Moreover, the second tail of the n-PDF varies from steep, to flat
like observed for the high mass star-forming clouds. We found that subregions
with flat second n-PDF tails display top-heavy CMFs. The CMF may evolve from
Salpeter to top-heavy throughout the star formation process from the quiescent
to the burst phase. This scenario raises the question of if the CMF might
revert again to Salpeter as the cloud approaches the end of its star formation
stage, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.

quantifier-free first-order logic formulas. We consider the theory of
non-linear real arithmetic where the formulae are logical combinations of
polynomial constraints. Here a commonly used tool is the Cylindrical Algebraic
Decomposition (CAD) to decompose real space into cells where the constraints
are truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.
  An improved approach is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based
algorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and
generalizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around
samples which are avoided in the continuing search. Such an approach can lead
to a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with
fewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanovi\'c and de Moura's
NLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are produced locally to a sample we might
need fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection. The
original NLSAT algorithm reduced the set a little; while Brown's single cell
construction reduced it much further still. However, the shape and size of the
cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered.
  This paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built
level-by-level according to a variable ordering. We still use a reduced number
of projection polynomials, but can now consider a variety of different
reductions and use heuristics to select the projection polynomials in order to
optimise the shape of the cell under construction. We formulate all the
necessary theory as a proof system: while not a common presentation for work in
this field, it allows an elegant decoupling of heuristics from the algorithm
and its proof of correctness.

entropy of coherence. For the electron and muon antineutrino oscillations, the
analytical trade-off relations obeyed by the Bell-CHSH inequality of pairwise

first-order coherence and intrinsic concurrence in NOs, showing how much
quantum resources flow between first-order coherence and intrinsic concurrence

negatively affect the performance of deep models, diagnosing the dataset and
identifying mislabeled samples helps to improve the generalization power.
Training dynamics, i.e., the traces left by iterations of optimization
algorithms, have recently been proved to be effective to localize mislabeled
samples with hand-crafted features. In this paper, beyond manually designed
features, we introduce a novel learning-based solution, leveraging a noise
detector, instanced by an LSTM network, which learns to predict whether a
sample was mislabeled using the raw training dynamics as input. Specifically,
the proposed method trains the noise detector in a supervised manner using the
dataset with synthesized label noises and can adapt to various datasets (either
naturally or synthesized label-noised) without retraining. We conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate the proposed method. We train the noise detector based
on the synthesized label-noised CIFAR dataset and test such noise detector on
Tiny ImageNet, CUB-200, Caltech-256, WebVision and Clothing1M. Results show
that the proposed method precisely detects mislabeled samples on various
datasets without further adaptation, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
Besides, more experiments demonstrate that the mislabel identification can
guide a label correction, namely data debugging, providing orthogonal
improvements of algorithm-centric state-of-the-art techniques from the data

non-steady modes of an open quantum many-body system. Assuming that the time
evolution of the density matrix of the system is described by a Markovian

For a dissipative spin model, it is shown that the most coherent mode exhibits
a transition from a disordered phase to a symmetry-broken ordered phase, even
if the steady state does not show singular behavior. We further argue that the
phase transition of the most coherent mode induces a qualitative change in the

relaxation time needed to reorganise, after a disturbance, the electron system

Legacy Program, we report the results of a ground-based absorption line survey
of simple molecules in diffuse and translucent Galactic clouds. Using the
Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30 m telescope, we surveyed
molecular lines in the 2 mm and 3 mm wavelength ranges toward 15 millimeter
continuum sources. These sources, which are all massive star-forming regions
located mainly in the first and second quadrants of the Milky Way, form the
subset of the HyGAL sample that can be observed by the IRAM 30 m telescope. We
detected HCO$^+$ absorption lines toward 14 sightlines, toward which we
identified 78 foreground cloud components, as well as lines from HCN, HNC,
C$_2$H, and c-C$_3$H$_2$ toward most sightlines. In addition, CS and H$_2$S
absorption lines are found toward at least half of the continuum sources.
Static Meudon photodissociation region (PDR) isobaric models that consider
ultraviolet-dominated chemistry were unable to reproduce the column densities
of all seven molecular species by just a factor of a few, except for H$_2$S.
The inclusion of other formation routes driven by turbulent dissipation could
possibly explain the observed high column densities of these species in diffuse
clouds. There is a tentative trend for H$_2$S and CS abundances relative to
H$_2$ to be larger in diffuse clouds ($X$(H$_2$S) and $X$(CS) $\sim 10^{-8} -
10^{-7}$) than in translucent clouds ($X$(H$_2$S) and $X$(CS) $\sim 10^{-9} -
10^{-8}$) toward a small sample; however, a larger sample is required in order
to confirm this trend. The derived H$_2$S column densities are higher than the
values predicted from the isobaric PDR models, suggesting that chemical
desorption of H$_2$S from sulfur-containing ice mantles may play a role in
increasing the H$_2$S abundance.

  Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization","The first two authors share the same contribution",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) learns to detect and
classify action instances with only category labels. Most methods widely adopt
the off-the-shelf Classification-Based Pre-training (CBP) to generate video
features for action localization. However, the different optimization
objectives between classification and localization, make temporally localized
results suffer from the serious incomplete issue. To tackle this issue without
additional annotations, this paper considers to distill free action knowledge
from Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), since we surprisingly observe that the
localization results of vanilla VLP have an over-complete issue, which is just
complementary to the CBP results. To fuse such complementarity, we propose a
novel distillation-collaboration framework with two branches acting as CBP and
VLP respectively. The framework is optimized through a dual-branch alternate
training strategy. Specifically, during the B step, we distill the confident
background pseudo-labels from the CBP branch; while during the F step, the
confident foreground pseudo-labels are distilled from the VLP branch. And as a
result, the dual-branch complementarity is effectively fused to promote a
strong alliance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on THUMOS14 and
ActivityNet1.2 reveal that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

dynamics of supercooled liquids from static averaged quantities. Compared to
techniques based on particle propensity, our method is built upon a theoretical
framework that uses as input and output system-averaged quantities, thus being
easier to apply in an experimental context where particle resolved information
is not available. In this work, we train a deep neural network to predict the
self intermediate scattering function of binary mixtures using their static
structure factor as input. While its performance is excellent for the
temperature range of the training data, the model also retains some
transferability in making decent predictions at temperatures lower than the
ones it was trained for, or when we use it for similar systems. We also develop
an evolutionary strategy that is able to construct a realistic memory function
underlying the observed non-Markovian dynamics. This method lets us conclude
that the memory function of supercooled liquids can be effectively
parameterized as the sum of two stretched exponentials, which physically
corresponds to two dominant relaxation modes.

galaxy samples can teach us much about how galaxies evolve. Massive galaxies
typically possess negative metallicity gradients, and mass and metallicity are
tightly correlated on local scales over wide range of galaxy masses; however,
the precise origins of such trends remain elusive. Here, we employ data from
SDSS-IV MaNGA to explore how gas metallicity depends on local stellar mass
density and on galactocentric radius within individual galaxies. We also
consider how the strengths of these dependencies vary across the galaxy
mass-size plane. We find that radius is more predictive of local metallicity
than stellar mass density in extended lower mass galaxies, while we find
density and radius to be almost equally predictive in higher-mass and more
compact galaxies. Consistent with previous work, we find a mild connection
between metallicity gradients and large-scale environment; however, this is
insufficient to explain variations in gas metallicity behaviour across the
mass-size plane. We argue our results to be consistent with a scenario in which
extended galaxies have experienced smooth gas accretion histories, producing
negative metallicity gradients over time. We further argue that more compact
and more massive systems have experienced increased merging activity that
disrupts this process, leading to flatter metallicity gradients and more
dominant density-metallicity correlations within individual galaxies.

$(0,1)$-matrices is, in general, $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard. In 1913 P\'olya asked for
which $(0,1)$-matrices $A$ it is possible to change some signs such that the
permanent of $A$ equals the determinant of the resulting matrix. In 1975,
Little showed these matrices to be exactly the biadjacency matrices of
bipartite graphs excluding $K_{3,3}$ as a \{matching minor}. This was turned
into a polynomial time algorithm by McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas in
1999. However, the relation between the exclusion of some matching minor in a
bipartite graph and the tractability of the permanent extends beyond $K_{3,3}.$
Recently it was shown that the exclusion of any planar bipartite graph as a
matching minor yields a class of bipartite graphs on which the {permanent} of
the corresponding $(0,1)$-matrices can be computed efficiently. In this paper
we unify the two results above into a single, more general result in the style
of the celebrated structure theorem for single-crossing-minor-free graphs. We
identify a class of bipartite graphs strictly generalising planar bipartite
graphs and $K_{3,3}$ which includes infinitely many non-Pfaffian graphs. The
exclusion of any member of this class as a matching minor yields a structure
that allows for the efficient evaluation of the permanent. Moreover, we show
that the evaluation of the permanent remains $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard on bipartite
graphs which exclude $K_{5,5}$ as a matching minor. This establishes a first
computational lower bound for the problem of counting perfect matchings on
matching minor closed classes.

the equation of state (EoS), we consider two non-linear relativistic mean-field

larger area requirement and lower performance for the memory. Bias Temperature
Instability (BTI) is one of the main contributors to aging, which slows down
transistors and ultimately causes permanent faults. In this paper, first, we
propose a low-cost aging mitigation scheme, which can be applied to existing
hardware to mitigate aging on memory address decoder logic. We mitigate the BTI
effect on critical transistors by applying a rejuvenation workload to the

transistors that are located on critical paths of the address decoder. Second,
we analyze workloads' efficiency to optimize the mitigation scheme.

to prevent failure. This is why non-destructive acoustic tests based on the
measurement of first order elastic constants have been developed and
intensively used. However, plastic deformations, which are usually
heterogeneous in space, may be invisible to these methods if the variation of
the elastic constants is too small. In recent years, digital image correlation
techniques, based on measurements carried out at the surface of a sample, have
been successfully used in conjunction with finite element modeling to gain
information about plastic deformation in the sample interior. Acoustic waves
can penetrate deep into a sample and offer the possibility of probing into the
bulk of a plastically deformed material. Previously, we have demonstrated that
nonlinear acoustic methods are far more sensitive to changes in dislocation
density than linear ones. Here, we show that the nonlinear Second Harmonic
Generation method (SHG) is sensitive enough to detect different zones of von
Mises stress as well as effective plastic strain in centimeter-size aluminium
pieces. This is achieved by way of ultrasonic measurements on a sample that has
undergone a three-point bending test. Because of the relatively low stress and
small deformations, the sample undergoes plastic deformation by dislocation
proliferation. Thus, we conclude that the nonlinear parameter measured by SHG
is also sensitive to dislocation density. Our experimental results agree with
numerical results obtained by Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling. We also
support the acoustic results by X-Ray Diffraction measurements (XRD). Although
intrusive and less accurate, they also agree with the acoustic measurements and
plastic deformations in finite element simulations.

model, a confidence level (the probability threshold for object detection) of
0.3 was set for nodule detection in the first phase (ensuring the entire
suspicious nodules are detected from the input CT images). The aim of the
hierarchy model is to detect and classify the entire lung nodules (from CT
images) with a low false-negative rate. Given the outcome of the first step, we
proposed a 3D CNN classifier to analyze and classify the suspicious nodules
detected by the YOLO model to achieve a nodule detection framework with a very
low false-negative rate. This framework was evaluated using the LUNA 16

nodules and 400000 non-nodules in the lung. Results: A large number of false
positives were detected due to the low confidence level used in the YOLO model.
Utilizing the 3D classifier, the accuracy of nodule detection was remarkably
enhanced. The YOLO model detected 294 suspicious nodules (out of 321) when
using a confidence level of 50%, wherein there were 107 false positives (187
true positives). By reducing the confidence level to 30%, 459 suspicious
nodules were identified by the YOLO model, wherein 138 were false positives,
and 321 were true positives. When the outcome of the YOLO model with a
confidence level of 30% was fed into the 3D CNN classifier, a nodule detection
accuracy of 98.4% and AUC of 98.9% were achieved Conclusion: The proposed
framework resulted in a few false-negative and false-positives pre-dictions in

stellar masses and the compactness of the structure required the sensitivity
and resolution of JWST for its identification. To assess the nature and
evolutionary path of CGG-z5, we searched for similar compact structures in the
\textsc{Eagle} simulations and followed their evolution with time. We find that
all the identified structures merge into a single galaxy by z=3 and form a
massive galaxy (log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>11$) at z~1. This implies that CGG-z5
could be a ""proto-massive galaxy"" captured during a short-lived phase of
massive galaxy formation.

we report that by using a conventional arrayed image sensor in combination with
2D Fourier analysis, the periodicities of light fields much smaller than the
pixel size can be resolved in a simple and compact setup, with a resolution far
beyond the Nyquist limit set by the pixel size. We demonstrate the ability to
resolve periodicities with spatial frequencies of ~3/$\mu$m, 15 times higher
than the pixel sampling frequency of 0.188/$\mu$m. This is possible by
analyzing high-quality Fourier aliases in the first Brillouin zone. In order to
obtain the absolute spatial frequencies of the interference patterns, we show
that simple rotation of the image sensor is sufficient, which modulates the
effective pixel size and allows determination of the original Brillouin zone.

which focuses on the prediction of a relational predicate from a
natural-language input unit (such as a sentence, a clause, or even a short
paragraph consisting of multiple sentences and/or clauses). Together with
named-entity recognition (NER) and disambiguation (NED), RE forms the basis for
many advanced IE tasks such as knowledge-base (KB) population and verification.
In this work, we explore how recent approaches for open information extraction
(OpenIE) may help to improve the task of RE by encoding structured information
about the sentences' principal units, such as subjects, objects, verbal
phrases, and adverbials, into various forms of vectorized (and hence
unstructured) representations of the sentences. Our main conjecture is that the
decomposition of long and possibly convoluted sentences into multiple smaller
clauses via OpenIE even helps to fine-tune context-sensitive language models

warning of the accident occurrence, and supports the decision making of safe
driving systems. Previous works usually concentrate on the spatial-temporal
correlation of object-level context, while they do not fit the inherent
long-tailed data distribution well and are vulnerable to severe environmental
change. In this work, we propose a Cognitive Accident Prediction (CAP) method
that explicitly leverages human-inspired cognition of text description on the
visual observation and the driver attention to facilitate model training. In
particular, the text description provides a dense semantic description guidance
for the primary context of the traffic scene, while the driver attention
provides a traction to focus on the critical region closely correlating with
safe driving. CAP is formulated by an attentive text-to-vision shift fusion
module, an attentive scene context transfer module, and the driver attention
guided accident prediction module. We leverage the attention mechanism in these
modules to explore the core semantic cues for accident prediction. In order to
train CAP, we extend an existing self-collected DADA-2000 dataset (with
annotated driver attention for each frame) with further factual text
descriptions for the visual observations before the accidents. Besides, we
construct a new large-scale benchmark consisting of 11,727 in-the-wild accident
videos with over 2.19 million frames (named as CAP-DATA) together with labeled
fact-effect-reason-introspection description and temporal accident frame label.
Based on extensive experiments, the superiority of CAP is validated compared
with state-of-the-art approaches. The code, CAP-DATA, and all results will be

Abramsky et al. showed that a range of examples of quantum contextuality is

the approach does not give a complete cohomological characterisation of
contextuality. A different cohomological approach to contextuality was
introduced by Okay et al. Their approach exploits the algebraic structure of
the Pauli operators and their qudit generalisations known as Weyl operators. We
give an abstract account of this structure, then generalise their approach to
any example of contextuality with this structure. We prove at this general
level that the approach does not give a more complete characterisation of
contextuality than the \v{C}ech cohomology approach.
  Bravyi, Gosset, and K\""{o}nig (BGK) gave the first unconditional proof that a
restricted class of quantum circuits is more powerful than its classical

quantum technologies. MOMs readily form low-dimensional structures, and so are
ideal systems to realise physical examples of key quantum models, including the
Haldane phase, where a topological excitation gap occurs in integer-spin
antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains. Thus far the Haldane phase has only been
identified for $S=1$, with $S \geq 2$ still unrealised because the larger spin
imposes more stringent requirements on the magnetic interactions. Here, we
report the structure and magnetic properties of CrCl$_2$(pym) (pym=pyrimidine),
a new quasi-1D $S=2$ AFM MOM. We show, using X-ray and neutron diffraction,
bulk property measurements, density-functional theory calculations and
inelastic neutron spectroscopy (INS) that CrCl$_2$(pym) consists of AFM
CrCl$_2$ spin chains ($J_1=-1.13(4)\;$meV) which are weakly ferromagnetically
coupled through bridging pym ($J_2=0.10(2)\;$meV), with easy-axis anisotropy
($D=-0.15(3)\;$meV). We find that although small compared to $J_1$, these
additional interactions are sufficient to prevent observation of the Haldane
phase in this material. Nevertheless, the proximity to the Haldane phase
together with the modularity of MOMs suggests that layered Cr(II) MOMs are a
promising family to search for the elusive $S=2$ Haldane phase.

completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random

trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an
upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the
convergence and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples

essentially three advantages: (i) To build $\widetilde{X}$ is straightforward;
(ii) The joint distribution of $(X,\widetilde{X})$ can be written in closed

mean absolute correlation and reconstructability. However, for NA to apply, the
distribution of $X$ needs to be of the form $$(*)\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad

probability measure $\mu_0$ which makes condition (*) true. If $\mu$ is
absolutely continuous, the approximation holds in total variation distance. In
applications, regarding $\mu$ as the distribution of $X$, this result suggests
using the knockoffs based on $\mu_0$ instead of those based on $\mu$ (which are
generally unknown). Our second result is a characterization of the pairs
$(X,\widetilde{X})$ where $\widetilde{X}$ is obtained via NA. It turns out that
$(X,\widetilde{X})$ is of this type if and only if it can be extended to an
infinite sequence so as to satisfy certain invariance conditions. The basic

planets is unknown. An inverse cascade has been suggested. Alternatively,
energy may be directly injected by small-scale convection. Our aim is to
clarify whether an inverse cascade feeds zonal jets and large-scale eddies in a
system of rapidly rotating, deep, geostrophic spherical-shell convection. We
analyze the nonlinear scale-to-scale transfer of kinetic energy in such
simulations as a function of the azimuthal wave number, m. We find that the
main driving of the jets is associated with upscale transfer directly from the
small convective scales to the jets. This transfer is very nonlocal in spectral
space, bypassing large-scale structures. The jet formation is thus not driven
by an inverse cascade. Instead, it is due to a direct driving by Reynolds
stresses from small-scale convective flows. Initial correlations are caused by
the effect of uniform background rotation and shell geometry on the flows.
While the jet growth suppresses convection, it increases the correlation of the
convective flows, which further amplifies the jet growth until it is balanced
by viscous dissipation. To a much smaller extent, energy is transferred upscale
to large-scale vortices directly from the convective scales, mostly outside the
tangent cylinder. There, large-scale vortices are not driven by an inverse
cascade either. Inside the tangent cylinder, the transfer to large-scale
vortices is weaker, but more local in spectral space, leaving open the
possibility of an inverse cascade as a driver of large-scale vortices. In
addition, large-scale vortices receive kinetic energy from the jets via forward
transfer. We therefore suggest a jet instability as an alternative formation
mechanism of largescale vortices. Finally, we find that the jet kinetic energy
scales as $\ell^{-5}$, the same as for the zonostrophic regime.

processing is difficult: expert annotations are expensive, and crowd-sourced
annotations may not be reliable. At the same time, recent work in NLP has
demonstrated that learning from a distribution over labels acquired from crowd
annotations can be effective. However, there are many ways to acquire such a
distribution, and the performance allotted by any one method can fluctuate
based on the task and the amount of available crowd annotations, making it
difficult to know a priori which distribution is best. This paper
systematically analyzes this in the out-of-domain setting, adding to the NLP
literature which has focused on in-domain evaluation, and proposes new methods
for acquiring soft-labels from crowd-annotations by aggregating the
distributions produced by existing methods. In particular, we propose to
aggregate multiple-views of crowd annotations via temperature scaling and
finding their Jensen-Shannon centroid. We demonstrate that these aggregation
methods lead to the most consistent performance across four NLP tasks on
out-of-domain test sets, mitigating fluctuations in performance from the
individual distributions. Additionally, aggregation results in the most
consistently well-calibrated uncertainty estimation. We argue that aggregating
different views of crowd-annotations is an effective and minimal intervention
to acquire soft-labels which induce robust classifiers despite the
inconsistency of the individual soft-labeling methods.

find the normal level of noise causes insufficient training of the model. To
address the above challenges, we propose Difformer, an embedding diffusion

geometry as a 1'' photomultiplier tube, including four 6 $\times$ 6 mm$^2$
SiPMs, amplifiers, high voltage supply, and microcontroller.
  Tests were carried out using the 35 MeV electron beam from the
superconducting Electron Linac for beams with high Brilliance and low Emittance
(ELBE) with its picosecond-level time jitter in two different modes of
operation, namely parasitic mode with one electron per bunch and single-user
mode with 1-60 electrons per bunch. Acqiris fast digitisers were used for data
acquisition. In addition, off-beam tests using cosmic rays and the NeuLAND data
acquisition scheme have been carried out.
  Typical time resolutions of $\sigma_t\leq$ 120 ps were found for $\geq$95%
efficiency for minimum ionising particles, improving on previous work at ELBE
and exceeding the NeuLAND timing goal of $\sigma_t$ < 150 ps. Over a range of
10-300 MeV deposited energy in the NeuLAND bar, the gain was found to deviate
by $\leq$10% ($\leq$20%) from linearity for 35 mm (75 mm) SiPM pitch,

The dark rate of the prototype studied was found to be lower than the expected

combination of an unknown reward vector and a given embedding of context-arm
pairs. In practice, the embedding is often learned at the same time as the
reward vector, thus leading to an online representation learning problem.
Existing approaches to representation learning in contextual bandits are either
very generic (e.g., model-selection techniques or algorithms for learning with
arbitrary function classes) or specialized to particular structures (e.g.,
nested features or representations with certain spectral properties). As a
result, the understanding of the cost of representation learning in contextual
linear bandit is still limited. In this paper, we take a systematic approach to
the problem and provide a comprehensive study through an instance-dependent
perspective. We show that representation learning is fundamentally more complex
than linear bandits (i.e., learning with a given representation). In
particular, learning with a given set of representations is never simpler than
learning with the worst realizable representation in the set, while we show
cases where it can be arbitrarily harder. We complement this result with an
extensive discussion of how it relates to existing literature and we illustrate
positive instances where representation learning is as complex as learning with
a fixed representation and where sub-logarithmic regret is achievable.

its exact nature is still one of the main open questions in modern physics. A
great experimental effort has been performed to probe one of the most popular
dark matter candidates, the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle or WIMP,
however, there has not been any conclusive detection yet. Hence, these searches
place strong constraints on the WIMP paradigm. The community has therefore
started to consider alternatives who are able to evade the strong experimental
constraints. Such a candidate that has gained a lot of attention in the recent
years is the Feebly Interacting Massive Particle or FIMP. Unlike the WIMP, the
FIMP has very feeble interactions. It is therefore unable to reach a state of
equilibrium which is needed to be produced trough freeze-out. Despite these
feeble interactions, there is still a variety of mechanisms able to produce the
observed amount of dark matter in our universe. In this work, a selection of
these mechanisms, such as freeze-in or conversion driven freeze-out, are
discussed in detail. Since these FIMPs are so feebly interacting with standard
model particles, it is difficult to probe these particles through conventional
direct and indirect detection searches. In contrast, the feeble couplings give
rise to long-lived particles coupling to the DM, which can hence be smoking gun
signatures for FIMPs. This thesis will therefore focus on searches for
long-lived particles, both at hadron colliders and beam-dump experiments. In
order to do so, a classification of FIMP models has been put forward within the
context of this PhD, in which potential production mechanisms are identified in
order to define a viable parameter space. Within this framework, both existing
and potential future searches for long-lived particles are discussed and
applied to a subset of the proposed classification.

markets, managing over \$10B in daily trading volume before its downfall. Such
a giant, however, failed to avoid the fate of mania, panic, and crash. In this
work, we revisit the FTX's crash by telling it as a Ponzi story. In regards to
why FTX could not sustain this Ponzi game, we extract and demonstrate the three
facilitators of the FTX collapse, namely, \textit{FTT}, \textit{leverage}, and
\textit{diversion}. The unfunctionality in each factor can iteratively magnify
the impact of damages when the panic is triggered. Rooted in the unstable
ground, FTX eventually suffered insolvency and rapidly crashed in Nov. 2022.
The crisis of FTX is not an isolated event; it consequently results in the
collapse of a chain of associated companies in the entire crypto market. Recall
this painful experience, we discuss possible paths for a way forward for both
CeFi and DeFi services.

challenges in autonomous driving, especially when driving in the high variety

Although one can collect data from these adverse conditions using cars equipped
with sensors, it is quite tedious to annotate the data for training. In this
work, we address this limitation and propose a CNN-based method that can
leverage the steering wheel angle information to improve the road area semantic
segmentation. As the steering wheel angle data can be easily acquired with the
associated images, one could improve the accuracy of road area semantic
segmentation by collecting data in new road environments without manual data
annotation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two
challenging data sets for autonomous driving and show that when the steering
task is used in our segmentation model training, it leads to a 0.1-2.9% gain in
the road area mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) compared to the corresponding

the incident wave is associated with a simple state of spin angular momentum, a
quantity recently introduced for acoustic waves in the literature. We
experimentally observe that this field predominantly forces a directional wave

characteristic of angular momentum in its orbital form, thereby demonstrating
the conversion mechanism. The numerical and experimental observations presented

size, the difference in intensity for the SDO/AIA data, and brightness
temperature for the ALMA data, between the CBPs inside and outside CHs ranged
from between 2$\sigma$ and 4.5$\sigma$, showing a statistically significant
difference between those two CBP groups. For CBP areas, CBPs within the CH
boundaries showed smaller areas on average, with the observed difference
between the two CBP groups between 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ for the SDO/AIA

also significantly different. Given the measured properties, we conclude that
the CBPs inside CHs tend to be less bright on average, but also smaller in

photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The total light throughput of such instruments
depends, besides the PMT photon detection efficiency (PDE), on the mirror dish
reflectivity, and the light absorption by the camera window. The supremacy of
PMTs is currently being challenged by photon sensors rapidly spreading in
popularity, the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), that are becoming a valid
alternative thanks to their high PDE, low operating voltage and flexibility in
installation. In this report, we investigate the performance of an existing
3$^{\mathrm{rd}}$-generation IACT array (taking as an example MAGIC) in which
PMTs would be replaced with SiPMs, with minimal further hardware intervention.
This would mean that other systems of the telescope responsible for the light

increase of sensitivity up to a factor of 2 for energies below 200~GeV.

unbiased substructure that can achieve better out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization than the original model. Existing works usually search the
invariant subnetwork using modular risk minimization (MRM) with out-domain
data. Such a paradigm may bring about two potential weaknesses: 1) Unfairness,
due to the insufficient observation of out-domain data during training; and 2)
Sub-optimal OOD generalization, due to the feature-untargeted model pruning on
the whole data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel Spurious
Feature-targeted model Pruning framework, dubbed SFP, to automatically explore
invariant substructures without referring to the above weaknesses.
Specifically, SFP identifies in-distribution (ID) features during training
using our theoretically verified task loss, upon which, SFP can perform ID
targeted-model pruning that removes branches with strong dependencies on ID
features. Notably, by attenuating the projections of spurious features into
model space, SFP can push the model learning toward invariant features and pull
that out of environmental features, devising optimal OOD generalization.
Moreover, we also conduct detailed theoretical analysis to provide the
rationality guarantee and a proof framework for OOD structures via model
sparsity, and for the first time, reveal how a highly biased data distribution
affects the model's OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on various OOD
datasets show that SFP can significantly outperform both structure-based and
non-structure OOD generalization SOTAs, with accuracy improvement up to 4.72%
and 23.35%, respectively.

In this work, we propose a robust CFD data-driven, quasi-steady (QS) Reduced
Order Model (ROM) to predict the lift and drag coefficients within a flapping
cycle. The model is derived for a rigid ellipsoid wing with different
parameterized kinematics in hovering conditions. The proposed ROM is built via
a two-stage regression. The first stage, defined as `in-cycle' (IC), computes
the parameters of a regression linking the aerodynamic coefficients to the
instantaneous wing state. The second stage, `out-of-cycle' (OOC), links the IC
weights to the flapping features that define the flapping motion. The training
and test dataset were generated via high-fidelity simulations using the overset
method, spanning a wide range of Reynolds numbers and flapping kinematics. The
two-stage regressor combines Ridge regression and Gaussian Process (GP)
regression to provide estimates of the model uncertainties. The proposed ROM
shows accurate aerodynamic predictions for widely varying kinematics. The model
performs best for smooth kinematics that generate a stable Leading Edge Vortex
(LEV). Remarkably accurate predictions are also observed in dynamic scenarios
where the LEV is partially shed, the non-circulatory forces are considerable,
and the wing encounters its own wake.

conduct transfer learning experiments on six datasets from the Unified Emotion

characterize the transitions between linear and nonlinear regimes when varying
the magnitude and frequency of the applied field but the linear response,
characterized by the frequency-dependent conductivity, is more efficiently
predicted from the equilibrium current fluctuations. To that end, we (rederive
and) use the Green-Kubo relation appropriate for overdamped dynamics, which
differs from the standard one for Newtonian or underdamped Langevin dynamics.
This expression highlights the contributions of the underlying Brownian
fluctuations and of the interactions of the particles between them and with
external potentials. While already known in the literature, this relation has
rarely been used to date, beyond the static limit to determine the effective
diffusion coefficient or the DC conductivity. The frequency-dependent
conductivity always decays from a bulk-like behavior at high frequency to a
vanishing conductivity at low frequency due to the confinement of the charge
carriers by the walls. We discuss the characteristic features of the crossover
between the two regimes, most importantly how the crossover frequency depends
on the confining distance and the salt concentration, and the fact that
adsorption on the walls may lead to significant changes both at high- and
low-frequencies. Conversely, our results illustrate the possibility to obtain
information on diffusion between walls, charge relaxation and adsorption by
analyzing the frequency-dependent conductivity.

connection between a purely combinatorial problem called the Rainbow Cycle
problem and a fairness notion known as $\efx$: assuming that the rainbow cycle
number for parameter $d$ (i.e. $\rainbow(d)$) is $O(d^\beta \log^\gamma d)$, we
can find a $(1-\epsilon)$-$\efx$ allocation with
$O_{\epsilon}(n^{\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}}\log^{\frac{\gamma}{\beta +1}} n)$
number of discarded goods \cite{chaudhury2021improving}. The best upper bound
on $\rainbow(d)$ is improved in a series of works to $O(d^4)$
\cite{chaudhury2021improving}, $O(d^{2+o(1)})$ \cite{berendsohn2022fixed}, and
finally to $O(d^2)$ \cite{Akrami2022}.\footnote{We refer to the note at the end
of the introduction for a short discussion on the result of \cite{Akrami2022}.}
Also, via a simple observation, we have $\rainbow(d) \in \Omega(d)$
\cite{chaudhury2021improving}.
  In this paper, we introduce another problem in extremal combinatorics. For a
parameter $\ell$, we define the rainbow path degree and denote it by
$\ech(\ell)$. We show that any lower bound on $\ech(\ell)$ yields an upper
bound on $\rainbow(d)$. Next, we prove that $\ech(\ell) \in \Omega(\ell^2/\log
n)$ which yields an almost tight upper bound of $\rainbow(d) \in \Omega(d \log
d)$. This in turn proves the existence of $(1-\epsilon)$-$\efx$ allocation with
$O_{\epsilon}(\sqrt{n \log n})$ number of discarded goods. In addition, for the
special case of the Rainbow Cycle problem that the edges in each part form a
permutation, we improve the upper bound to $\rainbow(d) \leq 2d-4$. We leverage
$\ech(\ell)$ to achieve this bound.
  Our conjecture is that the exact value of $\ech(\ell) $ is $ \lfloor
\frac{\ell^2}{2} \rfloor -1$. We provide some experiments that support this
conjecture. Assuming this conjecture is correct, we have $\rainbow(d) \in
\Theta(d)$.

representative client subset considering statistical heterogeneity and sends
the global model to them. After local training, these selected clients upload
compressed model updates matching their capabilities to the PS for aggregation,
which significantly alleviates the communication load and mitigates the
straggler effect. We theoretically analyze the impact of both client selection
and gradient compression on convergence performance. Guided by the derived
convergence rate, we develop an iteration-based algorithm to jointly optimize
client selection and compression ratio decision using submodular maximization
and linear programming. Extensive experiments on both real-world prototypes and

when assessing treatment effects in nonrandomized studies. In terms of
statistical methods, a number of new PS weighting methods were developed, and
it was shown that they can outperform PS matching in efficiency of treatment
effect estimation in different simulation settings. For assessing balance of
covariates in treatment groups, PS weighting methods commonly use the weighted
standardized difference, despite some deficiencies of this measure like, for
example, the distribution of the weighted standardized difference depending on
the sample size and on the distribution of weights. We introduce the weighted
z-difference as a balance measure in PS weighting analyses and demonstrate its
usage in a simulation study and by applying it to an example from cardiac
surgery. The weighted z-difference is computationally simple and can be
calculated for continuous, binary, ordinal and nominal covariates. By using
Q-Q-plots we can compare the balance of PS weighted samples immediately to the
balance in perfectly matched PS samples and to the expected balance in a
randomized trial.

algorithms for ground state energy estimation (GSEE) in chemistry and
materials. Given the many heuristic and non-heuristic methods being developed,
it is challenging to assess what combination of these will ultimately be used
in practice. One important metric for assessing utility is runtime. For most
GSEE algorithms, the runtime depends on the ground state preparation (GSP)
method. Towards assessing the utility of various combinations of GSEE and GSP
methods, we asked under which conditions a GSP method should be accepted over a
reference method, such as the Hartree-Fock state. We introduce a criteria for
accepting or rejecting a GSP method for the purposes of GSEE. We consider
different GSP methods ranging from heuristics to algorithms with provable
performance guarantees and perform numerical simulations to benchmark their
performance on different chemical systems, starting from small molecules like
the hydrogen atom to larger systems like the jellium. In the future this
approach may be used to abandon certain VQE ansatzes and other heursitics. Yet
so far our findings do not provide evidence against the use of VQE and more
expensive heuristic methods, like the low-depth booster. This work sets a
foundation from which to further explore the requirements to achieve quantum

  Paradigm of the Gravitational Collapse''; comments welcome",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asymptotically safe quantum gravity is an approach to quantum gravity that
achieves formulates a standard quantum field theory for the metric. Therefore,
even the deep quantum gravity regime, that is expected to determine the true
structure of the core of black holes, is described by a spacetime metric. The
essence of asymptotic safety lies in a new symmetry of the theory -- quantum
scale symmetry -- which characterizes the short-distance regime of quantum
gravity. It implies the absence of physical scales. Therefore, the Newton
coupling, which corresponds to a scale, namely the Planck length, must vanish
asymptotically in the short-distance regime. This implies a weakening of the
gravitational interaction, from which a resolution of classical spacetime
singularities can be expected. In practise, properties of black holes in
asymptotically safe quantum gravity cannot yet be derived from first
principles, but are constructed using a heuristic procedure known as
Renormalization Group improvement. The resulting asymptotic-safety inspired
black holes have been constructed both for vanishing and for nonvanishing spin
parameter. They are characterized by (i) the absence of curvature
singularities, (ii) a more compact event horizon and photon sphere, (iii) a
second (inner) horizon even at vanishing spin and (iv) a cold remnant as a
possible final product of the Hawking evaporation. Observations can start to
constrain the quantum-gravity scale that can be treated as a free parameter in
asymptotic-safety inspired black holes. For slowly-spinning black holes,
constraints from the EHT and X-ray observations can only constrain
quantum-gravity scales far above the Planck length. In the limit of
near-critical spin, asymptotic-safety inspired black holes may ``light up"" in a
way the ngEHT may be sensitive to, even for a quantum-gravity scale equalling
the Planck length.

extensive benchmarking studies usually take several hours which is problematic
when examining dozens of daily code changes in detail; hence, trade-offs have
to be made. Optimized microbenchmark suites, which only include a small subset

medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

exactly by converting a numerical integration problem into a finite sum.
Another key contribution is generating the transition probabilities of the

implicit representations, HARP models a hand with a mesh-based parametric hand
model, a vertex displacement map, a normal map, and an albedo without any

representation enables a truly scalable, robust, and efficient approach to hand

captured by a hand-held mobile phone and can be directly used in AR/VR
applications with real-time rendering capability. To enable this, we carefully
design and implement a shadow-aware differentiable rendering scheme that is
robust to high degree articulations and self-shadowing regularly present in
hand motion sequences, as well as challenging lighting conditions. It also
generalizes to unseen poses and novel viewpoints, producing photo-realistic
renderings of hand animations performing highly-articulated motions.
Furthermore, the learned HARP representation can be used for improving 3D hand
pose estimation quality in challenging viewpoints. The key advantages of HARP
are validated by the in-depth analyses on appearance reconstruction, novel-view

important problem from the fundamental and applied points of view. However,
accurately resolving the spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficients,
particularly in the direction perpendicular to the interfaces, has been a
standing problem. Naturally, the issue is the interface-induced broken
symmetry. Furthermore, molecules have a finite size, and their shape fluctuates
on a similar time scale as diffusion occurs, while deformation behavior is
additionally spatially dependent. Accounting for these properties of interfaces
and the molecular constituents of the fluid was hitherto not possible. Here we
propose a new approach to deriving the spatially dependent diffusion
coefficients of extended flexible molecules based on a 2-dimensional Fokker
Plank equation and systematic coarse-graining of the internal molecular degrees
of freedom. Our technique does not make assumptions on the separation of time
scales. For small molecules, it reduces to an analytic expression with the
prefactor adapted to different types of interfaces. To demonstrate our method,
we choose water and a family of ILs with increasing cation sizes as
paradigmatic examples of a systems where internal degrees of freedom have
little to major effects. After validating our model on the bulk liquids, we
clearly demonstrate the anisotropic nature of diffusion coefficients and
provide quantitative profiles for the mobility perpendicular to the interfaces.
We find that spatial variations in the diffusivities strongly correlate with
interface-induced structuring of the liquid. Notably, the diffusivity of
strongly confined ILs scales with the density at the solid-liquid interface,
but with a molecular size at the liquid vapor interface.

regarding the approximation leading terms, the error control and the initial

  Functions",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) is a bijection from a set of objects S
to the first |S| integers. It can be used as a building block in databases and
data compression. RecSplit [Esposito et al., ALENEX20] is currently the most
space efficient practical minimal perfect hash function. Its main building
blocks are splittings and bijections. Using a tree-like data structure,
RecSplit first splits the input set into small sets of constant size l and then
computes a bijection on each leaf. Both splittings and bijections heavily rely
on trying multiple hash functions in a brute-force way. We greatly improve the
construction time of RecSplit using two orthogonal approaches. On the one hand,
we explore the trade-off between (exponential time) brute force and more
informed (polynomial time) search heuristics. Rotation fitting hashes the
objects in each leaf to two sets and tries to combine them to a bijection by
cyclically shifting one set to fill the holes in the other. ShockHash
constructs a small cuckoo hash table in each leaf, which is overloaded to hold
more objects than the asymptotic maximum. On the other hand, we harness
parallelism on the level of bits, vectors, cores, and GPUs. In combination, the
resulting improvements yield speedups up to 241 on a CPU and up to 2072 using a
GPU. The original RecSplit implementation needs 19 minutes to construct an MPHF
for 1 Million objects with 1.56 bits per object. On the GPU, we achieve the
same space usage in 1.5 seconds. Given that the speedups are larger than the
increase in energy consumption, our implementation is more energy efficient
than the original implementation. As a result, our improved RecSplit
implementation is now the approach to perfect hashing with the fastest
construction time over a wide range of space budgets. Surprisingly, this even
holds for rather high space budgets where asymptotically faster methods are
available.

visible GTV (1 = <25%, 2 = 25%-50%, 3 = >50%-75%, and 4 = >75%-100%). Contrast
and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated for the GTV contour with
respect to a cropped background image. Both models were tested on the original
and pre-selected testing sets. The resulting surface and overlap metrics were
calculated comparing the clinical and autocontoured GTVs and the corresponding
clinical target volumes (CTVs).
  Results: 80 patients were pre-selected to have a continuous GTV within the
posterior fossa. Of these, 7, 41, 21, and 11 were visibly scored as 4, 3, 2,
and 1, respectively. The contrast and CNR removed an additional 11 and 20
patients from the dataset, respectively. The Dice similarity coefficients (DSC)
were 0.61 +/- 0.29 and 0.67 +/- 0.22 on the models without pre-selected
training data and 0.55 +/- 13.01 and 0.83 +/- 0.17 on the models with
pre-selected data, respectively. The DSC on the CTV expansions were 0.90 +/-
0.13. Conclusion: We automatically contoured continuous GTVs within the
posterior fossa on scans that had contrast >=10 HU. CT-Based auto-contouring
algorithms have potential to positively impact centers with limited MRI access.

to keep the systematic errors under control. In this proceedings, we discuss
finite-volume effects of the leading Hadron Vacuum Polarization (HVP)
contribution to the muon $g-2$ in the presence of C$^{\star}$ boundary

C$^{\star}$ boundary conditions provide a possible consistent formulation of
$\mathrm{QCD+QED}$ in finite volume. Even though these boundary conditions can
be avoided in the calculation of the leading HVP contribution, we find the
interesting result that they remove the leading exponential finite-volume

conditions cut the finite-size effects in half on a lattice of physical size
$M_{\pi}L=4$ and by a factor of almost ten for $M_{\pi}L=8$. We discuss the

challenging task, and has been widely studied. Embedding-based methods require
training on complex queries, and cannot generalize well to out-of-distribution
query structures. Recent work frames this task as an end-to-end optimization
problem, and it only requires a pretrained link predictor. However, due to the
exponentially large combinatorial search space, the optimal solution can only
be approximated, limiting the final accuracy. In this work, we propose QTO
(Query Computation Tree Optimization) that can efficiently find the exact
optimal solution. QTO finds the optimal solution by a forward-backward
propagation on the tree-like computation graph, i.e., query computation tree.
In particular, QTO utilizes the independence encoded in the query computation
tree to reduce the search space, where only local computations are involved
during the optimization procedure. Experiments on 3 datasets show that QTO
obtains state-of-the-art performance on complex query answering, outperforming
previous best results by an average of 22%. Moreover, QTO can interpret the
intermediate solutions for each of the one-hop atoms in the query with over 90%

show the importance of a global phase space analysis to address important

careful hyperparameter tuning is required to synchronize the feedforward and
feedback training, and frequent updates of the feedback path are usually

having these layer-wise autoencoders a necessary condition for TP to work? We
answer this question by presenting Fixed-Weight Difference Target Propagation
(FW-DTP) that keeps the feedback weights constant during training. We confirmed
that this simple method, which naturally resolves the abovementioned problems
of TP, can still deliver informative target values to hidden layers for a given

energy into electrochemical energy with an efficiency of 85.4%. For this, in
addition to an idealized light absorber, the HCSC has to be connected to the
external load by means of the so-called \emph{mono-energetic energy selective
contacts} (ESCs). However, the thermodynamic properties that these types of
contact have to exhibit, such as their electric, thermal conductivity and
Seebeck coefficient, have not been explored. This paper aims to fill this gap.
In this respect, we model electron transport in non-ideal ESCs using the
transport theory proposed by Datta and Landauer which has allowed us to
calculate the value of these parameters as a function of the temperature and
electrochemical potential of operation. Our findings also reveal that, to
preserve the HCSC efficiency above 82%, the ESCs could require in the order of
$3 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ electron states. As the ESCs depart from ideality,
the temperature of the hot carriers at which optimum efficiency is obtained
increases to above 2540 K. The mono-enenergetic selective contact characterized
by the highest energy demands an electric, thermal conductivity and Seebeck
coefficient that, when combined, are characterized by a high thermoelectric
figure of merit $(ZT\approx 8)$. We are not aware of any material exhibiting
this figure of merit which illustrates the difficulty in putting the HCSC
concept into practice. Conversely, our work supports the idea that pursuing
materials capable of transporting electrons ballistically through
mono-energetic electron channels can provide the key for achieving materials

Together, these assessments provide a more comprehensive toolbox of glial

Optimal Transport (OT), using the terminology and techniques of Fully
Probabilistic Design (FPD). Optimal Transport is the canonical method for
comparing probability measures and has been successfully applied in a wide
range of areas (computer vision Rubner et al. [2004], computer graphics Solomon
et al. [2015], natural language processing Kusner et al. [2015], etc.).
However, we argue that the current OT framework suffers from two shortcomings:
first, it is hard to induce generic constraints and probabilistic knowledge in
the OT problem; second, the current formalism does not address the question of
uncertainty in the marginals, lacking therefore the mechanisms to design robust
solutions. By viewing the OT problem as the optimal design of a probability
density function with marginal constraints, we prove that OT is an instance of
the more generic FPD framework. In this new setting, we can furnish the OT
framework with the necessary mechanisms for processing probabilistic
constraints and deriving uncertainty quantifiers, hence establishing a new
extended framework, called FPD-OT. Our main contribution in this paper is to
establish the connection between OT and FPD, providing new theoretical insights
for both. This will lay the foundations for the application of FPD-OT in a
subsequent work, notably in processing more sophisticated knowledge
constraints, as well as in designing robust solutions in the case of uncertain
marginals.

extend it, primarily, by looking at key ideas in physics that are quite germane
to it. Among the topics in physics that I discuss are black holes, the
holographic principle, string theory, duality, quantum gravity, and special
relativity. I discuss these ideas from physics with an eye to their relevance
for Hoffman's view.

earthquakes, wind, and explosions. Structural engineers should be able to
conduct real-time analysis in the aftermath or during extreme disaster events
requiring immediate corrections to avoid fatal failures. As a result, it is
crucial to predict dynamic stress distributions during highly disruptive events
in real-time. Currently available high-fidelity methods, such as Finite Element
Models (FEMs), suffer from their inherent high complexity and are
computationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce computational cost while
preserving accuracy, a deep learning model, Neuro-DynaStress, is proposed to
predict the entire sequence of stress distribution based on finite element
simulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) solver. The model was
designed and trained to use the geometry, boundary conditions and sequence of
loads as input and predict the sequences of high-resolution stress contours.
The performance of the proposed framework is compared to finite element
simulations using a PDE solver.

  Neuroscience",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, deep learning revolutionized machine learning and its
applications, producing results comparable to human experts in several domains,
including neuroscience. Each year, hundreds of scientific publications present
applications of deep neural networks for biomedical data analysis. Due to the
fast growth of the domain, it could be a complicated and extremely
time-consuming task for worldwide researchers to have a clear perspective of
the most recent and advanced software libraries. This work contributes to
clarify the current situation in the domain, outlining the most useful
libraries that implement and facilitate deep learning application to
neuroscience, allowing scientists to identify the most suitable options for
their research or clinical projects. This paper summarizes the main
developments in Deep Learning and their relevance to Neuroscience; it then
reviews neuroinformatic toolboxes and libraries, collected from the literature
and from specific hubs of software projects oriented to neuroscience research.
The selected tools are presented in tables detailing key features grouped by
domain of application (e.g. data type, neuroscience area, task), model
engineering (e.g. programming language, model customization) and technological
aspect (e.g. interface, code source). The results show that, among a high
number of available software tools, several libraries are standing out in terms
of functionalities for neuroscience applications. The aggregation and
discussion of this information can help the neuroscience community to devolop
their research projects more efficiently and quickly, both by means of readily
available tools, and by knowing which modules may be improved, connected or
added.

  Adversarial Attack for Face Recognition","Accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical adversarial attacks for Face Recognition (FR) models typically
generate discrete examples for target identity with a single state image.
However, such paradigm of point-wise attack exhibits poor generalization
against numerous unknown states of identity and can be easily defended. In this
paper, by rethinking the inherent relationship between the face of target
identity and its variants, we introduce a new pipeline of Generalized Manifold
Adversarial Attack (GMAA) to achieve a better attack performance by expanding
the attack range. Specifically, this expansion lies on two aspects - GMAA not
only expands the target to be attacked from one to many to encourage a good
generalization ability for the generated adversarial examples, but it also
expands the latter from discrete points to manifold by leveraging the domain
knowledge that face expression change can be continuous, which enhances the
attack effect as a data augmentation mechanism did. Moreover, we further design
a dual supervision with local and global constraints as a minor contribution to
improve the visual quality of the generated adversarial examples. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method based on extensive experiments, and
reveal that GMAA promises a semantic continuous adversarial space with a higher
generalization ability and visual quality

developed using TSMC 7nm process technology. It is the third generation of the
PEZY-SCx series developed by PEZY Computing, K.K. Supercomputers equipped with
the PEZY-SCx series have been deployed at several research centers and are used
for large scale scientific calculations.
  PEZY-SC3 outperforms previous PEZY-SCx and other processors in terms of
energy and area efficiency. To achieve high efficiency, PEZY-SC3 employs a MIMD
many-core, fine-grained multithreading, and non-coherent cache, focusing on
applications involving high thread-level parallelism. Our MIMD many-core-based
architecture achieves high efficiency while providing higher programmability
than existing architectures based on specialized tensor units with limited
functionality or wide-SIMD. Another key point of this architecture is to
achieve both high efficiency and high throughput without using complex and
expensive units such as out-of-order schedulers. Moreover, our novel
non-coherent and hierarchical cache system enables high scalability on
many-core without compromising programmability.
  The energy efficiency of a system equipped with PEZY-SC3 is approximately
24.6 GFlops/W, and it ranked 12th in the Green500 (November 2021), which
measures the energy efficiency of supercomputers. In terms of processor
architecture, all the systems ranked higher than the PEZY-SC3 system are
equipped with NVIDIA A100 or Preferred Networks MN-Core, and thus PEZY-SC3 is
the third-ranked processor after them. While A100 and MN-Core achieve high
energy efficiency with tensor units specialized for specific functions,
PEZY-SC3 does not have such specialized tensor units and thus has higher
programmability.
