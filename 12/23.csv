spherical cavity are fed into long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM NNs)
designed to distinguish knot types. The results show that they perform well in
knot recognition even if tested against flexible, strongly confined and
therefore highly geometrically entangled rings. In agreement with the
expectation that knots are delocalized in dense polymers, a suitable
coarse-graining procedure on configurations boosts the performance of the LSTMs
when knot identification is applied to rings much longer than those used for
training. Notably, when the NNs fail, usually the wrong prediction still
belongs to the same topological family of the correct one. The fact that the
LSTMs are able to grasp some basic properties of the ring's topology is
corroborated by a test on knot types not used for training. We also show that
the choice of the NN architecture is important: simpler convolutional NNs do
not perform so well. Finally, all results depend on the features used for
input: surprisingly, coordinates or bond directions of the configurations
provide the best accuracy to the NNs, even if they are not invariant under
rotations (while the knot type is invariant). Other rotational invariant
features we tested are based on distances, angles, and dihedral angles.

we can bootstrap the distance to the original, explosive source of the cavity,

supernova propagated outwards, it began to sweep up interstellar gas and carved
out the Local Chimney, a low-density extension of the Local Bubble that reaches
into the galactic halo.

  Deep Quantum Machine Learning",,,,,"quant-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Building a quantum analog of classical deep neural networks represents a
fundamental challenge in quantum computing. A key issue is how to address the
inherent non-linearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum
domain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum
gates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is
intrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in the
literature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of
unitary transformations. In this paper, we introduce the Quantum Path Kernel, a
formulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of
deep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization
performance in the classical domain, specifically, hierarchical feature
learning. Our approach generalizes the notion of Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel,
which has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine
learning models. The Quantum Path Kernel exploits the parameter trajectory,
i.e. the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training,
enabling the representation of differential layer-wise convergence behaviors,
or the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their
manifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function. We evaluate our
approach with respect to variants of the classification of Gaussian XOR
mixtures - an artificial but emblematic problem that intrinsically requires
multilevel learning in order to achieve optimal class separation.

the choice of microscopy may invalidate underlying assumptions of DDM. Here, we
study the DDM analysis of differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy

of a 3D appearance, which we show causes deformation of the output DDM matrix.
We present a mathematical description of this deformation, and conclude that,
when studying isotropic motion, no account of the DIC shadow needs to be
considered during DDM analysis. We validate our conclusions with simulated
particle data, and with DIC images of colloidal dispersions. Although this
conclusion does not generally extend to anisotropic motion, we demonstrate that
for directed advection and diffusion behaviour, parameter fitting invariance
still holds. These results validate the current practice of applying DDM to
DIC, and are a foundation for further exploration of DDM in other

First, we consider correlation functions of descendant states in
two-dimensional CFTs. We discuss a recursive formula to calculate them and
provide a computer implementation of it. This allows us to obtain any
correlation function of vacuum descendants, and for non-vacuum descendants to
express the correlator as a differential operator acting on the respective
primary correlator. With this code, we study some entanglement and
distinguishability measures between descendant states, i.e. the R\'enyi
entropy, trace square distance and sandwiched R\'enyi divergence. With our
results we can test the R\'enyi Quantum Null Energy Condition and provide new
tools to analyse the holographic description of descendant states. Second, we
study four-dimensional Weyl fermions on different backgrounds. Our interest is
in their trace anomaly, where the Pontryagin density has been claimed to
appear. To ascertain this possibility, we compute the anomalies of Dirac
fermions coupled to vector and axial non-abelian gauge fields and then in a
metric-axial-tensor background. Appropriate limits of the backgrounds allow to
recover the anomalies of Weyl fermions coupled to non-abelian gauge fields and
in a curved spacetime. In both cases we confirm the absence of the Pontryagin
density in the trace anomalies. Third, we provide the holographic description
of a four-dimensional CFT with an irrelevant operator. When the operator has
integer conformal dimension, its presence in the CFT modifies the Weyl
transformation of the metric, which in turns modifies the trace anomaly.
Exploiting the equivalence between bulk diffeomorphisms and boundary Weyl
transformations, we compute these modifications from the dual gravity theory.
Our results represent an additional test of the AdS/CFT conjecture.

time for the estimation of integrated variance through the realized variance
(RV) estimator. The intrinsic time transforms the clock time in accordance with
the market's activity, which we measure by trading intensity (transaction time)
or spot variance (business time). We theoretically show that the RV estimator
is unbiased for all sampling schemes, but most efficient under business time,
also under independent market microstructure noise. Our analysis builds on the
flexible assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion process that is
time-changed with a doubly stochastic Poisson process. This provides a flexible
stochastic model for the prices together with their transaction times that
allows for separate and stochastically varying trading intensity and tick
variance processes that jointly govern the spot variance. These separate model
components are particularly advantageous over e.g., standard diffusion models,
as they allow to exploit and disentangle the effects of the two different
sources of intraday information on the theoretical properties of RV. Extensive
simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that business time remains
superior under different noise specifications and for noise-corrected RV
estimators. An empirical application to stock data provides further evidence
for the benefits of using intrinsic sampling to get efficient RV estimators.

particles which violate CP symmetry will induce an electric dipole moment of

with feasible complexity has been a challenging problem. Initially, it was
believed that the main issue in this respect is the overall RF-cost. However,
as mMIMO is becoming more and more a key technology for future wireless
networks, it is realized, that the RF-cost is only one of many implementational
challenges and design trade-offs. In this paper, we present, analyze and
compare various novel mMIMO architectures, considering recent emerging
technologies such as intelligent surface-assisted and Rotman lens based
architectures. These are compared to the conventional fully digital (FD) and
hybrid analog-digital beamforming (HADB) approaches. To enable a fair
comparison, we account for various hardware imperfections and losses and
utilize a novel, universal algorithm for signal precoding. Based on our
thorough investigations, we draw a generic efficiency to quality trade-off for
various mMIMO architectures. We find that in a typical cellular communication
setting the reflect/transmit array based architectures sketch the best overall
trade-off. Further, we show that in a qualitative ranking the power efficiency
of the considered architectures is independent of the frequency range.

unsupervised positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction, which

first attempt to implement an end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image
reconstruction method that incorporates a forward-projection model into a loss
function. To implement a practical fully 3D PET image reconstruction, which
could not be performed due to a graphics processing unit memory limitation, we
modify the DIP optimization to block-iteration and sequentially learn an
ordered sequence of block sinograms. Furthermore, the relative difference
penalty (RDP) term was added to the loss function to enhance the quantitative
PET image accuracy. We evaluated our proposed method using Monte Carlo
simulation with [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data of a human brain and a preclinical study
on monkey brain [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data. The proposed method was compared with
the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (EM), maximum-a-posterior EM
with RDP, and hybrid DIP-based PET reconstruction methods. The simulation
results showed that the proposed method improved the PET image quality by
reducing statistical noise and preserved a contrast of brain structures and
inserted tumor compared with other algorithms. In the preclinical experiment,
finer structures and better contrast recovery were obtained by the proposed
method. This indicated that the proposed method can produce high-quality images
without a prior training dataset. Thus, the proposed method is a key enabling
technology for the straightforward and practical implementation of end-to-end
DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction.

  In this paper, we present DYST (Did You See That?), which represents a new
class of covert channels we call history covert channels. History covert
channels can communicate almost exclusively based on unaltered legitimate

mainly as they require to run a neural network for each reverse diffusion step,
whereas predictive approaches only require one pass. As diffusion models are
generative approaches they may also produce vocalizing and breathing artifacts
in adverse conditions. In comparison, in such difficult scenarios, predictive
models typically do not produce such artifacts but tend to distort the target
speech instead, thereby degrading the speech quality. In this work, we present
a stochastic regeneration approach where an estimate given by a predictive
model is provided as a guide for further diffusion. We show that the proposed
approach uses the predictive model to remove the vocalizing and breathing
artifacts while producing very high quality samples thanks to the diffusion
model, even in adverse conditions. We further show that this approach enables
to use lighter sampling schemes with fewer diffusion steps without sacrificing
quality, thus lifting the computational burden by an order of magnitude. Source

Radio Access Network (RAN) resources will need to be carefully ""sliced"" to

Existing slicing frameworks treat each DL task as equal and inflexibly define
the resources to assign to each task, which leads to sub-optimal performance.
In this paper, we propose SEM-O-RAN, the first semantic and flexible slicing
framework for NextG Open RANs. Our key intuition is that different DL
classifiers can tolerate different levels of image compression, due to the
semantic nature of the target classes. Therefore, compression can be
semantically applied so that the networking load can be minimized. Moreover,
flexibility allows SEM-O-RAN to consider multiple edge allocations leading to
the same task-related performance, which significantly improves system-wide
performance as more tasks can be allocated. First, we mathematically formulate
the Semantic Flexible Edge Slicing Problem (SF-ESP), demonstrate that it is
NP-hard, and provide an approximation algorithm to solve it efficiently. Then,
we evaluate the performance of SEM-O-RAN through extensive numerical analysis
with state-of-the-art multi-object detection (YOLOX) and image segmentation
(BiSeNet V2), as well as real-world experiments on the Colosseum testbed. Our
results show that SEM-O-RAN improves the number of allocated tasks by up to

within pre-defined tolerable limits, and provide a novel optimisation method to

recently emerged as versatile tools for studying interactions between these
species at very low temperatures. Such traps rely on the combination of
different types of external fields for the confinement of either species
raising the question of interactions between the individual traps. Here, the
influence of a strongly inhomogeneous magnetic field used for trapping neutrals
on the trapping and laser cooling of a single Ca$^+$ ion in a radiofrequency
ion trap is studied theoretically using molecular-dynamics simulations based on
multilevel rate equations. The inhomogeneous magnetic field couples the
different components of the ion motion and introduces position-dependent Zeeman
splittings. Nonetheless, laser cooling is still found to work efficiently as
the ion samples different magnetic field strengths and directions along its
trajectory. Offsetting the centres of the two traps generates a linear
magnetic-field gradient so that multiple lasers are required to address the
resulting range of Zeeman splittings in order to ensure efficient cooling. The
present study yields detailed insights into the ion cooling dynamics in
combined magnetic and radiofrequency electric fields relevant for the
characterisation and optimisation of hybrid trapping experiments.

range of responses from researchers, policymakers, civil society and industry.
Over the past decade, these stakeholders have developed many interventions to
tackle misinformation that vary across factors such as which effects of
misinformation they hope to target, at what stage in the misinformation
lifecycle they are aimed at, and who they are implemented by. These
interventions also differ in how effective they are at reducing susceptibility
to (and curbing the spread of) misinformation. In recent years, a vast amount
of scholarly work on misinformation has become available, which extends across
multiple disciplines and methodologies. It has become increasingly difficult to
comprehensively map all of the available interventions, assess their efficacy,
and understand the challenges, opportunities and tradeoffs associated with
using them. Few papers have systematically assessed and compared the various
interventions, which has led to a lack of understanding in civic and
policymaking discourses. With this in mind, we develop a new hierarchical
framework for understanding interventions against misinformation online. The
framework comprises three key elements: Interventions that Prepare people to be
less susceptible; Interventions that Curb the spread and effects of
misinformation; and Interventions that Respond to misinformation. We outline
how different interventions are thought to work, categorise them, and summarise
the available evidence on their efficacy; offering researchers, policymakers
and practitioners working to combat online misinformation both an analytical
framework that they can use to understand and evaluate different interventions
(and which could be extended to address new interventions that we do not
describe here) and a summary of the range of interventions that have been
proposed to date.

the dialogue context to dynamically refine knowledge from KGs for better

Reasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender (VRICR). Our key idea
is to incorporate the large dialogue corpus naturally accompanied with CRSs to
enhance the incomplete KGs; and perform dynamic knowledge reasoning conditioned
on the dialogue context. Specifically, we denote the dialogue-specific
subgraphs of KGs as latent variables with categorical priors for adaptive
knowledge graphs refactor. We propose a variational Bayesian method to
approximate posterior distributions over dialogue-specific subgraphs, which not
only leverages the dialogue corpus for restructuring missing entity relations

proton and nuclei interactions, a neutrino flux comparable to the $\gamma$-ray
flux is expected from the same sky region. Data collected by the ANTARES
neutrino telescope are used to constrain the neutrino flux from the Galactic
Ridge in the 1-100 TeV energy range. Neutrino events reconstructed both as
tracks and showers are considered in the analysis and the selection is
optimized for the search of an excess in the region $|l| < 30\deg$, $|b| <
2\deg$. The expected background in the search region is estimated using an
off-zone region with similar sky coverage. Neutrino signal originating from a
power-law spectrum with spectral index ranging from $\Gamma_\nu=1$ to $4$ is
simulated in both channels. The observed energy distributions are fitted to
constrain the neutrino emission from the Ridge. The energy distributions in the
signal region are inconsistent with the background expectation at $\sim 96\%$
confidence level. The mild excess over the background is consistent with a
neutrino flux with a power law with a spectral index $2.45^{+0.22}_{-0.34}$ and
a flux normalization $dN_\nu/dE_\nu = 4.0^{+2.7}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-16}

from interactions of cosmic ray protons and nuclei with a power-law spectrum
extending well into the PeV energy range.

eliminate these adverse effects. This paper proposes a framework for studying
the factors that affect LBTC outcomes in EDs. The framework integrates machine
learning, metaheuristic optimization, and model interpretation techniques.
Metaheuristic optimization is used for hyperparameter optimization--one of the
main challenges of machine learning model development. Three metaheuristic
optimization algorithms are employed for optimizing the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB), which are simulated annealing (SA), adaptive simulated
annealing (ASA), and adaptive tabu simulated annealing (ATSA). The optimized

nonlinear PDEs, we propose an augmentation method that transfers the nonlinear
PDE into an equivalent PDE system linear in all derivatives that our PIGPI can
handle. PIGPI can be applied to multi-dimensional PDE systems and PDE systems
with unobserved components. The method completely bypasses the numerical solver
for PDE, thus achieving drastic savings in computation time, especially for
nonlinear PDEs. Moreover, the PIGPI method can give the uncertainty
quantification for both the unknown parameters and the PDE solution. The
proposed method is demonstrated by several application examples from different
areas.

transients such as supernovae. In many cases, asymmetries in the supernova
explosions are thought to be responsible for the large observed velocities of
neutron stars. We aim to study the complete evolutionary history of one
particular eccentric high-mass X-ray binary containing a neutron star, GX
301-2, and characterize the natal kick at the time of neutron star formation.
We used the publicly available stellar-evolution code MESA to evolve binaries
from their initial stages until the core-collapse scenario. We incorporated a
natal kick distribution based on observations to continue the evolution during
the X-ray binary phase and search for candidates matching current observations
of GX 301-2. We find that the range of initial masses is constrained to be less
than around $30$ M$_\odot$ depending on the initial mass ratio, as higher
initial masses will most likely end up producing a black hole. In the
completely conservative mass-transfer scenario under study, only is an
interaction between the stars when the donor is still burning Hydrogen in its
core, the so-called Case A of mass transfer, able to produce progenitors for GX
301-2. The natal kick study favours kicks of variable strength, which in turn
increases the tilt angle between the orbital angular momentum and the spin of
the neutron star. We conclude that only a narrow initial progenitor parameter
space is able to produce a binary such as GX 301-2. Additionally, the strength
of the natal kick can span a wide range of values, but it can be constrained
when considering new data concerning the systemic velocity of the binary.
Finally, we derive the fraction of the expected number of binaries such as GX
301-2 in the Galaxy to be $\sim 6 \times 10^{-5}$, implying a really low chance
of finding a binary similar to GX 301-2.

through a high-dimensional state space transiently visiting the neighbourhoods
of unstable simple invariant solutions. The grand hope has always been to turn
this appealing picture into a predictive framework where the statistics of the
flow follows from one appropriately-weighted sum of the statistics of each
simple invariant solution. Two outstanding obstacles have prevented this goal
from being achieved: (1) paucity of known solutions and (2) as yet no rational
theory to predict the required weights. Here we describe a method to
substantially solve the former and a data-driven approach to overcome the
latter. In doing so, we provide the first compelling evidence that the
statistics of a fully developed turbulent flow can be reconstructed with a set
of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). The new method for finding solutions is
based on automatic differentiation in which high-quality guesses are
constructed by minimising a trajectory-dependent loss function with gradient
descent and then these are fully converged using a Newton solve. Unlike past
work, the approach does not require observation of a `near recurrence' on a
turbulent orbit and can be used to target solutions with specific physical
properties via the addition of appropriate terms to the loss. Scores of new
solutions are found with short periods in turbulent, two-dimensional Kolmogorov
flow. These can be used to reproduce a variety of statistical quantities after
`learning' weights for each periodic orbit by fitting to one statistic only. To
our knowledge, this is the first time the statistics of a
spatio-temporally-chaotic system have been successfully reproduced with a set
of simple invariant states, and provides a fascinating connection between
self-sustaining dynamical processes and the more well-known statistical
properties of turbulence.

studies have provided various types of QEC codes; one of the notable
topological codes is the surface code, and its features, such as the
requirement of only nearest-neighboring two-qubit control gates and a large
error threshold, make it a leading candidate for scalable quantum computation.
Recent developments of machine learning (ML)-based techniques especially the
reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been applied to the decoding problem
and have already made certain progress. Nevertheless, the device noise pattern
may change over time, making trained decoder models ineffective. In this paper,
we propose a continual reinforcement learning method to address these decoding
challenges. Specifically, we implement double deep Q-learning with
probabilistic policy reuse (DDQN-PPR) model to learn surface code decoding
strategies for quantum environments with varying noise patterns. Through
numerical simulations, we show that the proposed DDQN-PPR model can
significantly reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, increasing the

results open a way to build more capable RL agents which can leverage

characterize the grain alignment conditions and dust properties responsible for
the observed polarized dust emission in the inner envelopes (~1000 au) of Class
0 protostars. We analyzed the polarized dust emission maps obtained with ALMA
and compared them to molecular line emission maps of specific molecular
tracers, mainly CCH, which allowed us to probe one of the key components in
dust grain alignment theories: the irradiation field. We show that CCH peaks
toward outflow cavity walls, where the polarized dust emission is also
enhanced. Our analysis provides a tentative correlation between the morphology
of the polarized intensity and CCH emission, suggesting that the radiation
field impinging on the cavity walls favors both the grain alignment and the
warm carbon chain chemistry in these regions. We propose that shocks happening
along outflow cavity walls could potentially represent an additional source of
photons contributing to dust grain alignment. However, some parts of the cores,
such as the equatorial planes, exhibit enhanced polarized flux, although no
radiation driven chemistry is observed, for example where radiative torques are
theoretically not efficient enough. This suggests that additional physical

at the LHC and future $pp$ colliders falls short to fully probe the whole mass
range allowed for electroweak charged dark matter particles, which extends in
principle up to the O(0.1) PeV. In this work we examine the effect of on-shell
and off-shell propagation of electroweak charged thermal dark matter particles
on integrated and differential rates of several Standard Model final states at
the muon collider, considering candidates from weak 2-plet at the TeV scale up
to 7-plet and 9-plet in the O(0.1) PeV ballpark. For fermionic WIMPs we find
that all dark matter candidates with $n\leq 5$, corresponding to a thermal mass
up to 14~TeV, can be excluded at the high-energy muon collider for some
center-of-mass energy at or below 14~TeV. For the $n>5$ WIMPs our results show
that higher energy muon colliders offer a route to conclusively probe both
scalar and fermionic WIMPs off-shell production all the way up to the
perturbativity bound for WIMP dark matter at O(0.1)~PeV. Our results bring
WIMPs over the whole allowed mass range in the realm of collider searches and

PLD is close to Decision Tree/Random Forest methods, but it differs

solves the optimization problem related to the search for rules (called
probabilistic laws), which have a minimal length and relatively high

Probabilistic laws are human-readable and PLD based models are transparent and

resolve the potential singularity sufficiently close to the potential blow-up

accurate. Scaling analysis and the dynamic rescaling formulation are presented
to quantitatively study the scaling properties of the potential singularity. We
demonstrate that this potential blow-up is stable with respect to the

$\alpha$ is smaller than some critical value $\alpha^*$. By properly rescaling
the initial data in the $z$-axis, this upper bound for potential blow-up
$\alpha^*$ can asymptotically approach $1/3$. Compared with Elgindi's blow-up

stiffness of two-dimensional materials using simple atomistic tests on small
periodic unit cells. The tests are designed such that bending deformations are
dominating and membrane deformations are minimized. Atomistic ab-initio
simulations then allow for the efficient computation of bending energies.
Density functional theory is used for this. Atomistic bending energies are then
compared to classical models from structural mechanics. Two different models
are considered for this -- one based on beam theory and one based on rigid
linkage theory -- and their results are compared with each other. Four
different materials with 2D hexagonal (honeycomb) structure are chosen as a
case study: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, silicene, and blue phosphorene.
The calculated bending stiffnesses converge with increasing unit cell size,
such that small unit cells already provide accurate results that are in good
agreement with the literature. Using the same atomistic tests, it is shown that
the bending stiffness of graphene can still be considered constant at
moderately large deformations. Apart from being efficient and accurate, the
proposed approach allows for various extensions.

ergodic sector and a much smaller scar subspace. It has been suggested
[arXiv:2007.00845] that the two sectors may be distinguished by their
transformation properties under a large group whose rank grows with the system
size (it is not a symmetry of the Hamiltonian). The quantum many-body scars are
invariant under this group, while all other states are not. Here we apply this
idea to lattice systems containing $M$ Majorana fermions per site. The Hilbert
space for $N$ sites may be decomposed under the action of the
O$(N)\times$O$(M)$ group, and the scars are the SO$(N)$ singlets. For any even
$M$ there are two families of scars. One of them, which we call the $\eta$
states, is symmetric under the group O$(N)$. The other, the $\zeta$ states, has
the SO$(N)$ invariance. For $M=4$, where our construction reduces to spin-$1/2$
fermions on a lattice with local interactions, the former family are the $N+1$
$\eta$-pairing states, while the latter are the $N+1$ states of maximum spin.
We generalize this construction to $M>4$. For $M=6$ we exhibit explicit
formulae for the scar states and use them to calculate the bipartite
entanglement entropy analytically. For large $N$, it grows logarithmically with
the sub-system size. We present a general argument that any group-invariant
scars should have the entanglement entropy that is parametrically smaller than
that of typical states. The energies of the scars we find are not equidistant
in general but can be made so by choosing Hamiltonian parameters. For $M>6$ we
find that with local Hamiltonians the scars typically have certain
degeneracies. The scar spectrum can be made ergodic by adding a non-local
interaction term. We derive the dimension of each scar family and show the
scars could have a large contribution to the density of states for small $N$.

  Simulation Method on Near-Term Quantum Computers","15 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a cost-reduced method for finite-temperature
molecular dynamics on a near-term quantum computer, Quantum Car-Parrinello
molecular dynamics (QCPMD). One of the most promising applications of near-term
quantum computers is quantum chemistry. It has been expected that simulations
of molecules via molecular dynamics can be also efficiently performed on
near-term quantum computers by applying a promising near-term quantum algorithm
of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). However, this method may demand
considerable computational costs to achieve a sufficient accuracy, and
otherwise, statistical noise can significantly affect the results. To resolve
these problems, we invent an efficient method for molecular time evolution
inspired by Car-Parrinello method. In our method, parameters characterizing the
quantum state evolve based on equations of motion instead of being optimized.
Furthermore, by considering Langevin dynamics, we can make use of the intrinsic
statistical noise. As an application of QCPMD, we propose an efficient method
for vibrational frequency analysis of molecules in which we can use the results
of the molecular dynamics calculated by QCPMD. Numerical experiments show that
our method can precisely simulate the Langevin dynamics at the equilibrium
state, and we can successfully predict a given molecule's eigen frequencies.
Furthermore, in the numerical simulation, our method achieves a substantial
cost reduction compared with molecular dynamics using the VQE. Our method
achieves an efficient computation without using widely employed method of the
VQE. In this sense, we open up a new possibility of molecular dynamics on
near-term quantum computers. We expect our results inspire further invention of
efficient near-term quantum algorithms for simulation of molecules.

cluttered environments with many small objects. Limitations in 3D sensing
capabilities often make it difficult to detect every possible object. While
deep learning approaches may be effective for this problem, manually annotating
3D data for supervised learning is time-consuming. In this work, we explore
zero-shot instance segmentation (ZSIS) from RGB-D data to identify unseen
objects in a semantic category-agnostic manner. We introduce a zero-shot split
for Tabletop Objects Dataset (TOD-Z) to enable this study and present a method
that uses annotated objects to learn the ``objectness'' of pixels and
generalize to unseen object categories in cluttered indoor environments. Our
method, SupeRGB-D, groups pixels into small patches based on geometric cues and
learns to merge the patches in a deep agglomerative clustering fashion.
SupeRGB-D outperforms existing baselines on unseen objects while achieving
similar performance on seen objects. We further show competitive results on the
real dataset OCID. With its lightweight design (0.4 MB memory requirement), our
method is extremely suitable for mobile and robotic applications. Additional
DINO features can increase performance with a higher memory requirement. The

solve the $n$-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations and use the scaling
analysis and dynamic rescaling method to examine the potential blow-up and
capture its self-similar profile. Our study shows that the $n$-dimensional
axisymmetric Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up
when the H\""{o}lder exponent $\alpha<\alpha^*$, and this upper bound $\alpha^*$
can asymptotically approach $1-\frac{2}{n}$. Moreover, we introduce a
stretching parameter $\delta$ along the $z$-direction. Based on a few
assumptions inspired by our numerical experiments, we obtain
$\alpha^*=1-\frac{2}{n}$ by studying the limiting case of $\delta \rightarrow
0$. For the general case, we propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model
and numerically verify its approximation to the $n$-dimensional Euler

exponential suppression of bit-flip errors and an extensive set of gates

blocks of a hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum processor. In this
paper, we propose a performance optimization of the repetition cat code
architecture using fast but noisy CNOT gates for stabilizer measurements. This
optimization leads to high thresholds for the physical figure of merit, given
as the ratio between intrinsic single-photon loss rate of the bosonic mode and
the engineered two-photon loss rate, as well as a very interesting scaling
below threshold of the required overhead, to reach an expected level of logical
error rate. Relying on the specific error models for cat qubit operations, this
optimization exploits fast parity measurements, using accelerated low-fidelity
CNOT gates, combined with fast ancilla parity-check qubits. The significant
enhancement in the performance is explained by: 1- the highly asymmetric error
model of cat qubit CNOT gates with a major component on control (ancilla)
qubits, and 2- the robustness of the error correction performance in presence
of the leakage induced by fast operations. In order to demonstrate these
performances, we develop a method to sample the repetition code under

the opportunity to perform the first layer of error correction in a single

while introducing a minimal number of additional error channels? We focus on
the two-qubit portion of this control problem by using a 3-wave mixing coupling
element to engineer a programmable beamsplitter interaction between two bosonic
modes separated by more than an octave in frequency, without introducing major
additional sources of decoherence. Combining this with single-oscillator
control provided by a dispersively coupled transmon provides a framework for
quantum control of multiple encoded qubits. The beamsplitter interaction
$g_\text{bs}$ is fast relative to the timescale of oscillator decoherence,
enabling over $10^3$ beamsplitter operations per coherence time, and
approaching the typical rate of the dispersive coupling $\chi$ used for
individual oscillator control. Further, the programmable coupling is engineered
without adding unwanted interactions between the oscillators, as evidenced by
the high on-off ratio of the operations, which can exceed $10^5$. We then
introduce a new protocol to realize a hybrid controlled-SWAP operation in the
regime $g_{bs}\approx\chi$, in which a transmon provides the control bit for
the SWAP of two bosonic modes. Finally, we use this gate in a SWAP test to
project a pair of bosonic qubits into a Bell state with measurement-corrected
fidelity of $95.5\% \pm 0.2\%$.

This quadrature approach allows to establish a one to one correspondence, for a
given local set of data on a given stencil, between the discretization of a
non-local integral operator, and the local steady differential problem. This
equivalence is a discrete well balanced notion which allows to construct
balanced schemes without explicit knowledge of the steady state, and in
particular without the need of solving a local Cauchy problem. The use of
Gauss-Lobatto DGSEM allows a natural connection to continuous collocation
methods for integral equations. This allows to fully characterize the discrete
steady solution with a superconvergence result. The notion of entropy control
is also included in the construction via appropriately designed cell artificial
viscosity corrections. The accuracy and equilibrium preservation of these
corrections are characterized theoretically and numerically. In particular,
thorough numerical benchmarking, we confirm all the theoretical expectations
showing improvements in accuracy on steady states of one or more orders of
magnitude, with a simple modification of a given DGSEM implementation.
Robustness on more complex cases involving the propagation of sharp wave fronts
is also proved. Preliminary tests on multidimensional problems shows
improvements on the preservation of vortex like solutions with important error
reductions, despite of the fact that no genuine 2D balancing criterion is

only weakly correlated with economic opportunities (R2=0.30), while
multidimensional constructs are highly correlated (R2=0.62). In particular,
economic opportunities are associated to the combination of: i) knowledge ties,
which bridge geographically distant groups, facilitating the knowledge
dissemination across communities; and ii) social support ties, which knit
geographically close communities together, and represent dependable sources of
social and emotional support. These results point to the importance of

the throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually

adjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the
hash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a
hybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput
regardless of the graph's degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three
different formats based on a vertex's degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the
edges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single
cache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii)
High-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case,
adjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the
hash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further
optimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that
fully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a
thread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the
adjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated
GraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four

spanners, emulators, and distance oracles to the extremal function $\gamma$ of
high-girth graphs. This paper initiated a large body of work in network design,
in which problems are attacked by reduction to $\gamma$ or the analogous
extremal function for other girth concepts. In this paper, we introduce and
study a new girth concept that we call the bridge girth of path systems, and we
show that it can be used to significantly expand and improve this web of
connections between girth problems and network design. We prove two kinds of
results:
  1) We write the maximum possible size of an $n$-node, $p$-path system with
bridge girth $>k$ as $\beta(n, p, k)$, and we write a certain variant for
""ordered"" path systems as $\beta^*(n, p, k)$. We identify several arguments in
the literature that implicitly show upper or lower bounds on $\beta, \beta^*$,
and we provide some polynomially improvements to these bounds. In particular,
we construct a tight lower bound for $\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially
improve the upper bounds for $\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\beta^*(n, p, \infty)$.
  2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be
recovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\beta$ or $\beta^*$.
Examples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets,
shortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an
integrality gap for directed Steiner forest.
  We believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more
organized map of the research area. Towards this, we leave many open problems,
related to both bridge girth reductions and extremal bounds on the size of path
systems with high bridge girth.

platform for probing the physics of self-assembly. Binding molecules are free
to diffuse and rearrange on the surface, giving rise to spontaneous control
over the number of droplet-droplet bonds, i.e., valence, as a function of the
concentration of binders. This type of valence control has been realized
experimentally by tuning the interaction strength between DNA-coated emulsion
droplets. Optimizing for valence two yields droplet polymer chains, termed
`colloidomers', which have recently been used to probe the physics of folding.
To understand the underlying self-assembly mechanisms, here we present a
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) model to study the self-assembly of
this class of systems using explicit representations of mobile binding sites.
We explore how valence of assembled structures can be tuned through kinetic
control in the strong binding limit. More specifically, we optimize
experimental control parameters to obtain the highest yield of long linear
colloidomer chains. Subsequently tuning the dynamics of binding and unbinding
via a temperature-dependent model allows us to observe the heptamer chain
collapse into all possible rigid structures, in good agreement with recent
folding experiments. Our CGMD platform and dynamic bonding model (implemented
as an open-source custom plugin to HOOMD-Blue) reveal the molecular features
governing the binding patch size and valence control, and opens the study of
pathways in colloidomer folding. This model can therefore guide programmable
design in experiments.

bosonic configurations. In this region of parameter space we observe
approximate quadratic scalings between the mass of the cloud with $\lambda$,
the scalar field amplitude, and the couplings between these two parameters. For
systems with $\lambda$ beyond this range, the eigenfrequencies differ
sufficiently from the known free-test-field values used as inputs in our

This bounds the range of $\lambda$ in which the free scalar field solution

electroweak phase transition can proceed simultaneously with the confinement
phase transition of the new strong dynamics that produces the composite Higgs.
The latter transition is controlled by the dilaton - the pseudo-Goldstone boson
of an approximate scale invariance of the composite sector. Since it naturally
is first-order, the electroweak phase transition becomes first-order too.
Another appealing aspect is that the necessary additional source of CP
violation can arise from the variation of the quark Yukawa couplings during the
phase transition, which is built-in naturally in this scenario. These two
features address the shortcomings of electroweak baryogenesis in the Standard
Model. We confront this scenario with the latest experimental bounds derived
from collider searches for new resonances and measurements of the Higgs
couplings and electric dipole moments. All these constraints provide (or will
be able to provide in the near future) important bounds on the considered
scenario, with the most stringent ones coming from LHC searches for new
resonances which constrain the dilaton mass and couplings. We identify the
viable region of parameter space which satisfies all the constraints, and is
characterized by a dilaton mass in the $300-500$ GeV range and a Higgs decay

gravitational fields as they propagate through the Universe. However, their low
frequency, phase coherence and feeble coupling to matter allow for distinct
lensing phenomena, such as diffraction and central images, that are challenging
to observe through electromagnetic sources. Here we explore how these phenomena
can be used to probe features of gravitational lenses. We focus on two variants
of the singular isothermal sphere, with 1) a variable slope of the matter
density and 2) a central core. We describe the imprints of these features in
the wave- and geometric-optics regimes, including the prospect of detecting
central images. We forecast the capacity of LISA and advanced LIGO to study
strongly lensed signals and measure the projected lens mass, impact parameter
and slope or core size. A broad range of lens masses allows all parameters to
be measured with precision up to $\sim 1/{\rm SNR}$, despite large
degeneracies. Thanks to wave-optics corrections, all parameters can be
measured, even when no central image forms. Although GWs are sensitive to
projected quantities, we compute the probability distribution of lens redshift,
virial mass and projection scale given a cosmology. As an application, we
consider the prospect of constraining self-interacting and ultra-light dark

quantum states in a sample-efficient manner, by making use of randomized
measurements. Here we study the sample complexity of learning the expectation
value of Pauli operators via ``shallow shadows'', a recently-proposed version
of classical shadows in which the randomization step is effected by a local
unitary circuit of variable depth $t$. We show that the shadow norm (the
quantity controlling the sample complexity) is expressed in terms of properties
of the Heisenberg time evolution of operators under the randomizing
(``twirling'') circuit -- namely the evolution of the weight distribution
characterizing the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially. For
spatially-contiguous Pauli operators of weight $k$, this entails a competition
between two processes: operator spreading (whereby the support of an operator
grows over time, increasing its weight) and operator relaxation (whereby the
bulk of the operator develops an equilibrium density of identity operators,
decreasing its weight). From this simple picture we derive (i) an upper bound
on the shadow norm which, for depth $t\sim \log(k)$, guarantees an exponential
gain in sample complexity over the $t=0$ protocol in any spatial dimension, and
(ii) quantitative results in one dimension within a mean-field approximation,
including a universal subleading correction to the optimal depth, found to be
in excellent agreement with infinite matrix product state numerical
simulations. Our work connects fundamental ideas in quantum many-body dynamics
to applications in quantum information science, and paves the way to
highly-optimized protocols for learning different properties of quantum states.

investigated this interaction in La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ using single

out-of-plane breathing modulation of the surrounding lanthanum layers, which
leads to a related distortion on the adjacent copper-oxygen layer. Our result
implies that the CDW-related structural distortions do not remain confined to a
single layer but rather propagate an appreciable distance through the crystal.
This leads to overlapping structural modulations, in which CuO$_2$ planes
exhibit distortions arising from the orthogonal CDWs in adjacent layers as well
as distortions from the CDW within the layer itself. We attribute this striking

and analytical models, we visualise and explain the features observed in the
data. Results: We demonstrated with Gaia data that source structure
(multiplicity or extendedness) or pollution from close-by bright objects can
cause biases in the image parameter determination from which photometric,
astrometric and (indirectly) radial velocity time series are derived. These
biases are a function of the time-dependent scan direction of the instrument
and thus can introduce scan-angle dependent signals, which in turn can result
in specific spurious periodic signals. Numerical simulations qualitatively
reproduce the general structure observed in the spurious period and spatial
distribution of photometry and astrometry. A variety of statistics allows for
identification of affected sources. Conclusions: The origin of the scan-angle
dependent signals and subsequent spurious periods is well-understood and is in
majority caused by fixed-orientation optical pairs with separation <0.5""
(amongst which binaries with P>>5y) and (cores of) distant galaxies. Though the
majority of sources with affected derived parameters have been filtered out
from the Gaia archive, there remain Gaia DR3 data that should be treated with
care (e.g. gaia_source was untouched). Finally, the various statistics
discussed in the paper can not only be used to identify and filter affected
sources, but alternatively reveal new information about them not available
through other means, especially in terms of binarity on sub-arcsecond scale.

the road with cars at the maximum speed of about 15-20 mph, which is more
flexible and much faster than the pedestrains and bicyclists. These features
make e-scooters challenging for human drivers, pedestrians, vehicle active
safety modules, and self-driving modules to see and interact. To study this new
mobility option and address e-scooter riders' and other road users' safety
concerns, this paper proposes a wearable data collection system for
investigating the micro-level e-Scooter motion behavior in a Naturalistic road
environment. An e-Scooter-based data acquisition system has been developed by
integrating LiDAR, cameras, and GPS using the robot operating system (ROS).
Software frameworks are developed to support hardware interfaces, sensor
operation, sensor synchronization, and data saving. The integrated system can
collect data continuously for hours, meeting all the requirements including
calibration accuracy and capability of collecting the vehicle and e-Scooter
encountering data.

can detect the Hawking radiation of photons from primordial black holes (PBHs)
if they make up a fraction or all of dark matter. PBHs can analogously also
Hawking radiate new particles, which is especially interesting if these
particles are mostly secluded from the Standard Model (SM) sector, since they
might therefore be less accessible otherwise. A well-motivated example of this
type is axion-like particles (ALPs) with a tiny coupling to photons. We assume
that the ALPs produced by PBHs decay into photons well before reaching the
earth, so these will augment the photons directly radiated by the PBHs.
Remarkably, we find that the peaks in the energy distributions of ALPs produced
from PBHs are different than the corresponding ones for Hawking radiated
photons due to the spin-dependent greybody factor. Therefore, we demonstrate
that this process will in fact distinctively modify the PBHs' gamma-ray
spectrum relative to the SM prediction. We use monochromatic asteroid-mass PBHs
as an example to show that e-ASTROGAM can observe the PBH-produced ALP
gamma-ray signal (for masses up to ~60 MeV) and further distinguish it from
Hawking radiation without ALPs. By measuring the gamma-ray signals, e-ASTROGAM
can thereby probe yet unexplored parameters in the ALP mass and photon
coupling.

the different turns of the phase spiral and using the vertical frequencies from
commonly used MW potential models. We find that the phase spiral extends down
to $-1.2$ kpc in height below the plane (about 3 to 5 scale heights of the thin

positive vertical velocities when coloured by azimuthal velocity and in the
counts projection. We also find complex variations of the phase spirals with
angular momentum and azimuth. All these possibly provide evidence of multiple
perturbations (from different times or from different perturbers) and/or of the
complexity of the phase mixing process. We detect the phase spiral from 6 to 11
kpc from the Galactic centre and find signatures of vertical asymmetries 1-2
kpc beyond this range. We measure small but clear variations with azimuth. When
we determine the phase mixing times from the phase spiral at different angular
momenta and using the different spiral turns (at different $Z$) we obtain
inconsistent times with systematic differences (times increasing with $|L_Z|$
and with $|Z|$). Our determinations are mostly in the range of [0.3-0.9] Gyr,
with an average of 0.5 Gyr. The inconsistencies do not change when using
different usual potential models, different stellar distances or frequencies

The Snail appears as straight lines in the vertical frequency--vertical phase
plane when effects from sample selection are removed. Their slope has the
dimension of inverse time, with the simplest interpretation being the inverse
age of the Snail. Here, we devise and fit a simple model in which the spiral
starts as a lopsided perturbation from steady state, that winds up into the
present-day morphology. The winding occurs because the vertical frequency
decreases with vertical action. We use data from stars in Gaia EDR3 that have
measured radial velocities, pruned by simple distance and photometric selection
functions. We divide the data into boxels of dynamical invariants (radial
action, angular momentum); our model fits the data well in many of the boxels.
The model parameters have physical interpretations: one, $A$, is a perturbation
amplitude, and one, $t$, is interpretable in the simplest models as the time
since the event that caused the Snail. We find trends relating the strength and
age to angular momentum: (i) the amplitude $A$ is small at low angular momentum
($<1\,600\mathrm{\,kpc\,km\,s}^{-1}$ or guiding-centre radius $< 7.3\,$kpc),
and over a factor of three larger, with strong variations, in the outer disc;
(ii) there is no single well-defined perturbation time, with $t$ varying
between 0.2 and 0.6 Gyr. Residuals between the data and the model display

propagation in nonlinear photonic lattices. The interplay between nonlinearity
and periodicity has led researchers to manipulate light and discover new and
interesting phenomena such as new classes of localized modes, usually referred
to as solitons, and novel surface states that propagate robustly. A field where
both nonlinearity and periodicity arises naturally is nonlinear optics. But
there are other areas where waves propagating on background lattices play an
important role, including photonic crystal fibers and Bose-Einstein
condensation. In this review article the propagation of wave envelopes in one
and two-dimensional periodic lattices associated with additional potential in
the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, termed lattice NLS equations, are
studied. A discrete reduction, known as the tight-binding approximation, is
employed to find the linear dispersion relation and the equations governing
nonlinear discrete envelopes for two-dimensional simple periodic lattices and
two-dimensional non-simple honeycomb lattices. In the limit under which the
envelopes vary slowly, continuous envelope equations are derived from the
discrete system. The coefficients of the linear evolution system are related to
the dispersion relation in both the discrete and continuous cases. For simple
lattices, the continuous systems are NLS type equations. In honeycomb lattices,
in certain cases, the continuous system is found to be nonlinear Dirac
equations. Finally, it is possible to realize so-called topological insulator
systems in an optical waveguide setting. The modes supported by these systems
are associated with spectral topological invariants and, remarkably, can
propagate without backscatter from lattice defects.

enlarged by the inclusion of the spontaneously broken $S_4$ discrete symmetry
group, supplemented by the preserved $Z_2$ and broken $Z_4$ cyclic symmetries.
The first one has an extra inert scalar singlet field, whereas the second one
has an inert scalar doublet. Both models yield the same structure of the mass
matrices for the fermion sector, where a radiative seesaw generates the tiny
light active neutrinos masses at one-loop level. The presence of flavor
changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars allowed us to study the
$(K^0-\overline{K}^0)$ and $(B_{d,s}^0-\overline{B}_{d,s}^0)$ meson mixings, in
the parameter space that currently satisfies the experimental constraints. The
extra scalars in our models provide radiative corrections to the oblique
parameters, where due to the presence of the scalar inert doublet, model 2 is
less restrictive than model 1. Due to the preserved $Z_2$ symmetry, our
proposed models have stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates.
Furthermore, these models are consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion
masses and mixings, with the measured dark matter relic abundance and
successfully accommodate the constraints arising from meson oscillations,
oblique parameters and $W$ mass anomaly.

circuits, allowing designers to express how composite and variable-length data

provides a higher-level method for defining interfaces between components as
opposed to existing bit- and byte-based interface specifications.
  In this thesis, an open-source intermediate representation (IR) is introduced
which allows for the declaration of Tydi's types. The IR enables creating and
connecting components with Tydi Streams as interfaces, called Streamlets. It
also lets backends for synthesis and simulation retain high-level information,
such as documentation. Types and Streamlets can be easily reused between
multiple projects, and Tydi's streams and type hierarchy can be used to define
interface contracts, which aid collaboration when designing a larger system.
  The IR codifies the rules and properties established in the Tydi
specification and serves to complement computation-oriented hardware design
tools with a data-centric view on interfaces. To support different backends and
targets, the IR is focused on expressing interfaces, and complements behavior
described by hardware description languages and other IRs. Additionally, a
testing syntax for the verification of inputs and outputs against abstract
streams of data, and for substituting interdependent components, is presented
which allows for the specification of behavior.
  To demonstrate this IR, a grammar, parser, and query system have been
created, and paired with a backend targeting VHDL.

implementing an approximate analytical spacetime of spinning, inspiralling BBHs
in e-NOVAs. We follow the formation of a weak spiral structure in disc density
arising from the retardation effects in the radiation zone metric. Simulation
data are then post-processed with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code
incorporating the same BBH spacetime, assuming SMBBH sources. The density
spiral creates a small (<1%) but unambiguous modulation of the lightcurve at
the semi-orbital period. This signal, although weak, is fundamentally different
from that of an axisymmetric disc around a single BH providing a lower limit on
the impact of a BBH on its outer disc. This potential difference being found,
we study how binary parameters impact this modulation in order to find the
optimal case which is a high source inclination of any binary mass ratio (from
0.1 to 1).

experimental data. Our calculations for the Au-\textit{fcc}(011)/Ge(001) show
how the presence of defects in the interface layer can help to stabilize the
atomic pattern consistent with microscopic images. The Au-\textit{hcp}/Ge
interface with the significant mismatch between two surfaces reveals large
atomic displacements, which might indicate that the (111) germanium substrate
is not responsible for the formation of the \textit{hcp} phase of gold.
Finally, analyzing the electronic properties, we demonstrate that Au/Ge systems

complex task, as it needs to quantify the associations of risk factors and

individual's disease course involves non-terminal (e.g., disease progression)
and terminal (e.g., death) events, which form semi-competing relationships. Our
motivation comes from the Boston Lung Cancer Study, a large lung cancer
survival cohort, which investigates how risk factors influence a patient's
disease trajectory. Following developments in the prediction of time-to-event
outcomes with neural networks, deep learning has become a focal area for the
development of risk prediction methods in survival analysis. However, limited
work has been done to predict multi-state or semi-competing risk outcomes,
where a patient may experience adverse events such as disease progression prior
to death. We propose a novel neural expectation-maximization algorithm to
bridge the gap between classical statistical approaches and machine learning.
Our algorithm enables estimation of the non-parametric baseline hazards of each

among different transitions, via a multi-task deep neural network with

compilers such as Halide for image processing and TVM for machine learning are
difficult to extend with the new optimisations required by new algorithms and
hardware. Second, automatic optimisation is often unable to achieve the
required performance, and performance engineers often fall back to painstaking
manual optimisation.

domain-extensibility, controllable automation, and generate high performance
code. Domain-extensibility facilitates adapting compilers to new algorithms and

Navier-Stokes equations with time-dependent boundary conditions. This ROM is
velocity-only, i.e. the simulation of the velocity does not require the
computation of the pressure, and preserves the structure of the kinetic energy
evolution. The key ingredient of the novel ROM is a decomposition of the
velocity into a field with homogeneous boundary conditions and a lifting
function that satisfies the mass equation with the prescribed inhomogeneous
boundary conditions. This decomposition is inspired by the Helmholtz-Hodge
decomposition and exhibits orthogonality of the two components. This
orthogonality is crucial to preserve the structure of the kinetic energy
evolution. To make the evaluation of the lifting function efficient, we propose
a novel method that involves an explicit approximation of the boundary
conditions with POD modes, while preserving the orthogonality of the velocity
decomposition and thus the structure of the kinetic energy evolution. We show
that the proposed velocity-only ROM is equivalent to a velocity-pressure ROM,
i.e., a ROM that simulates both velocity and pressure. This equivalence can be
generalized to other existing velocity-pressure ROMs and reveals valuable
insights in their behaviour. Numerical experiments on test cases with
inflow-outflow boundary conditions confirm the correctness and efficiency of
the new ROM, and the equivalence with the velocity-pressure formulation.

deformation is sometimes apparent in retrospect, it remains challenging to
predict the sudden transition from gradual deformation (creep) to runaway
failure. We use a network science method -- multilayer modularity optimization
-- to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of deformation in a region near
the 2017 Mud Creek, California landslide. We transform satellite radar data
from the study site into a spatially-embedded network in which the nodes are
patches of ground and the edges connect the nearest neighbors, with a series of
layers representing consecutive transits of the satellite. Each edge is
weighted by the product of the local slope (susceptibility to failure) measured

rheological state) from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We
use multilayer modularity optimization to identify strongly-connected clusters

images taken with JWST with our optical HST images of the star-bursting barred

population of massive young clusters of any known galaxy within 30 Mpc, with
$\sim$ 30 star clusters that are more massive than 10$^6$ Msolar and younger
than 10 Myr. Sixteen of these clusters are newly discovered from our JWST

fairness at the global level by either modifying the graph structure or

and develop a computational framework for learning such locally fair
embeddings. We argue that the notion of neighborhood fairness is more
appropriate since GNN-based models operate at the local neighborhood level of a
node. Our neighborhood fairness framework has two main components that are
flexible for learning fair graph representations from arbitrary data: the first
aims to construct fair neighborhoods for any arbitrary node in a graph and the
second enables adaption of these fair neighborhoods to better capture certain
application or data-dependent constraints, such as allowing neighborhoods to be
more biased towards certain attributes or neighbors in the graph.Furthermore,
while link prediction has been extensively studied, we are the first to
investigate the graph representation learning task of fair link classification.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neighborhood fairness
framework for a variety of graph machine learning tasks including fair link
prediction, link classification, and learning fair graph embeddings. Notably,
our approach achieves not only better fairness but also increases the accuracy
in the majority of cases across a wide variety of graphs, problem settings, and

equivalent regions of the solution space has shed some light on the complexity
of error surfaces, and some promising properties like mode connectivity.
However, finding the right permutation is challenging, and current optimization
techniques are not differentiable, which makes it difficult to integrate into a
gradient-based optimization, and often leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this
paper, we propose a Sinkhorn re-basin network with the ability to obtain the
transportation plan that better suits a given objective. Unlike the current
state-of-art, our method is differentiable and, therefore, easy to adapt to any
task within the deep learning domain. Furthermore, we show the advantage of our
re-basin method by proposing a new cost function that allows performing
incremental learning by exploiting the linear mode connectivity property. The
benefit of our method is compared against similar approaches from the
literature, under several conditions for both optimal transport finding and
linear mode connectivity. The effectiveness of our continual learning method
based on re-basin is also shown for several common benchmark datasets,
providing experimental results that are competitive with state-of-art results
from the literature.

performance on zero-shot image classification and image-to-text retrieval.
However, such zero-shot performance of CLIP-based models does not realize in
tasks that require a finer-grained correspondence between vision and language,
such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). We investigate why this is the case,
and report an interesting phenomenon of CLIP, which we call the Concept
Association Bias (CAB), as a potential cause of the difficulty of applying CLIP
to VQA and similar tasks. CAB is especially apparent when two concepts are
present in the given image while a text prompt only contains a single concept.
In such a case, we find that CLIP tends to treat input as a bag of concepts and
attempts to fill in the other missing concept crossmodally, leading to an
unexpected zero-shot prediction. For example, when asked for the color of a
lemon in an image, CLIP predicts ``purple'' if the image contains a lemon and
an eggplant. We demonstrate the Concept Association Bias of CLIP by showing
that CLIP's zero-shot classification performance greatly suffers when there is
a strong concept association between an object (e.g. lemon) and an attribute
(e.g. its color). On the other hand, when the association between object and
attribute is weak, we do not see this phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that CAB
is significantly mitigated when we enable CLIP to learn deeper structure across
image and text embeddings by adding an additional Transformer on top of CLIP
and fine-tuning it on VQA. We find that across such fine-tuned variants of
CLIP, the strength of CAB in a model predicts how well it performs on VQA.

true classical limit characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic phase space,
which are not subject to any particular dynamical constraint. We demonstrate
genuine quantum scarring of wave functions concentrated in the vicinity of

localization about those classical modes. Their existence is consistent with
Heller's scar criterion and appears to persist in the thermodynamic

irregularities that reflect the underlying chaotic dynamics, as opposed to

resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such
inverse problems for specific sizes. One should, therefore, find multiple
microarchitectural designs that exhibit the desired properties for a specimen
with given dimensions. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be
resistant to fatigue and fracture, meaning that peak stresses should be
minimized as well. Such a multi-objective inverse design problem is formidably
difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real-world applications of
mechanical metamaterials. Here, we propose a modular approach titled
'Deep-DRAM' that combines four decoupled models, including two deep learning
models (DLM), a deep generative model (DGM) based on conditional variational
autoencoders (CVAE), and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep-DRAM
(deep learning for the design of random-network metamaterials) integrates these
models into a unified framework capable of finding many solutions to the
multi-objective inverse design problem posed here. The integrated framework
first introduces the desired elastic properties to the DGM, which returns a set
of candidate designs. The candidate designs, together with the target specimen
dimensions are then passed to the DLM which predicts their actual elastic
properties considering the specimen size. After a filtering step based on the
closeness of the actual properties to the desired ones, the last step uses
direct FE simulations to identify the designs with the minimum peak stresses.

Luckily, these weaknesses appear to be complementary, with symbolic systems

components of scalar (and psedudosclar) mesons below and above 1 GeV is applied
to the $\pi\eta$ channel in which the isovector scalars $a_0(980)$ and
$a_0(1450)$ are probed. In the leading order, the model parameters have been
previously fixed by various low-energy experimental data, and then applied to
$\pi\pi$ and $\pi K$ channels in which the properties of the light and broad
$\sigma$ and $\kappa$ mesons are extracted in agreement with estimates reported
in the literature. With the same parameters fixed in the leading order, in the
present work the prediction of the model for the $\pi\eta$ scattering amplitude
in the elastic region is given and unitarized with the K-matrix method. The
poles of the unitarized scattering amplitude, which determine the mass and
decay width of $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1450)$ are computed. It is found that the
model predicts an isovector scalar state below 1 GeV, with mass 984 $\pm$ 6 MeV
and decay width 108 $\pm$ 30 MeV which is a clear signal for the $a_0(980)$.
The $a_0$ pole extracted in this work, further supports the plausibility of the
mixing patterns for scalar mesons predicted by this model according to which
there is a significant underlying mixing among scalars below and above 1 GeV,
with those below 1 GeV being generally of four-quark nature while those above 1
GeV being overall closer to quark-antiquark states. Predictions for various
scattering lengths as well as for properties of $a_0(1450)$ are also presented.

territory of in the field of quantum materials. Here we report large anomalous
Hall conductivity in a Kondo lattice ferromagnet USbTe which is dominated by
intrinsic Berry curvature at low temperatures. However, the Berry curvature
induced anomalous Hall effect does not follow the scaling relation derived from
Fermi liquid theory. The onset of the Berry curvature contribution coincides
with the Kondo coherent temperature. Combined with ARPES measurement and DMFT
calculations, this strongly indicates that Berry curvature is hosted by the
flat bands induced by Kondo hybridization at the Fermi level. Our results
demonstrate that the Kondo coherence of the flat bands has a dramatic influence
on the low temperature physical properties associated with the Berry curvature,
calling for new theories of scaling relations of anomalous Hall effect to
account for the interaction between strong correlation and Berry curvature.

are widely used in network planning and optimization. However, as networks
increase in scale and complexity, some models present limitations, such as the
assumption of markovian traffic in queuing theory models, or the high
computational cost of network simulators. Recent advances in machine learning,
such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), are enabling a new generation of network
models that are data-driven and can learn complex non-linear behaviors. In this
paper, we present RouteNet-Fermi, a custom GNN model that shares the same goals
as queuing theory, while being considerably more accurate in the presence of
realistic traffic models. The proposed model predicts accurately the delay,
jitter, and loss in networks. We have tested RouteNet-Fermi in networks of
increasing size (up to 300 nodes), including samples with mixed traffic
profiles -- e.g., with complex non-markovian models -- and arbitrary routing
and queue scheduling configurations. Our experimental results show that
RouteNet-Fermi achieves similar accuracy as computationally-expensive
packet-level simulators and it is able to accurately scale to large networks.
For example, the model produces delay estimates with a mean relative error of
6.24% when applied to a test dataset with 1,000 samples, including network
topologies one order of magnitude larger than those seen during training.

particle number through the chemical potential, can be extended to the slow
driving regime in a thermodynamically consistent way. As a key application of

enhancement that was previously predicted for this type of engine on the basis
of an endoreversible model [New J. Phys. 24, 025001 (2022)]. Using an earlier

more power at given efficiency than an equally large collection of single-body

To this end, we introduce the circuit-QED dual-rail qubit in which our physical

The dominant photon loss errors can be detected and converted into erasure
errors, which are much easier to correct. In contrast to linear optics, a
circuit-QED implementation of the dual-rail code offers completely new
capabilities. Using a single transmon ancilla, we describe a universal gate set

transmon in all of these operations can be detected and converted to erasure
errors, leaving background Pauli errors that are orders of magnitude smaller.
Hence, the dual-rail cavity qubit delivers an optimal hierarchy of errors and
rates, and is expected to be well below the relevant QEC thresholds with

maps the error states -- which have opposite parity -- back onto the code
states. Here, we realize a collection of photon-number-selective, simultaneous
photon addition operations on a bosonic mode, a microwave cavity, assisted by a
superconducting qubit. These operations are implemented as two-photon
transitions that excite the cavity and the qubit at the same time. The
additional degree of freedom of the qubit makes it possible to implement a
coherent, unidirectional mapping between spaces of opposite photon parity. We
present the successful experimental implementation of the drives and the phase
control they enable on superpositions of Fock states. The presented technique,
when supplemented with qubit reset, is suitable for autonomous quantum error
correction in bosonic systems, and, more generally, opens the possibility to
realize a range of non-unitary transformations on a bosonic mode.

semi-analytic geometric model for approximating GB energy. It is determined
that the energy predicted by all IPs (that are stable for the given boundary

factor. It thus is concluded that the qualitative form of the GB energy versus

can strongly affect the energy level. The spread in GB energy predictions
across the ensemble of IPs in OpenKIM provides a measure of uncertainty for GB
energy predictions by classical IPs.

picoseconds due to a lack of experimental probes to visualize their dynamics in
real time at the nanoscopic scale. Here, we use ultrafast electron diffraction
to directly observe light-activated wrinkling formation in a freestanding
La$_{2/3}$Ca$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ film. Via a ``lock-in'' analysis of a single mode
of oscillation in the diffraction peak position, intensity, and width, we are
able to quantitatively reconstruct how wrinkles develop at the picosecond
timescale. Contrary to the common assumption of a fixed boundary condition for
freestanding films, we found that wrinkle development is associated with
ultrafast delamination at the contact point between the film boundary and the
underlying substrate, avoiding a strain build-up in the film. Not only does our
work provide a generic protocol to quantify wrinkling dynamics in freestanding

role in classical and quantum information processing. Recently, strong
nonreciprocal effects have been experimentally demonstrated in cavity
optomechanical systems. In these approaches, the bandwidth of the nonreciprocal
photon transmission is limited by the mechanical resonator linewidth, which is
arguably much smaller than the linewidths of the cavity modes in most
electromechanical or optomechanical devices. In this work, we demonstrate
broadband nonreciprocal photon transmission in the \emph{reversed-dissipation}
regime, where the mechanical mode with a large decay rate can be adiabatically
eliminated while mediating anti-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dissipative coupling
with two kinds of phase factors. Adjusting the relative phases allows the
observation of \emph{periodic} Riemann-sheet structures with distributed
exceptional points (Eps). At the Eps, destructive quantum interference breaks
both the $\mathcal{T}$- and $\mathcal{P}$-inversion symmetry, resulting in
unidirectional and chiral photon transmissions. In the reversed-dissipation
regime, the nonreciprocal bandwidth is no longer limited by the mechanical mode
linewidth but is improved to the linewidth of the cavity resonance.
Furthermore, we find that the direction of the unidirectional and chiral energy
transfer could be reversed by changing the \emph{parity} of the Eps. Extending
non-Hermitian couplings to a three-cavity model, the broken
anti-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry allows us to observe high-order Eps, at which a
parity-dependent chiral circulator is demonstrated. The driving-phase
controlled periodical Riemann sheets allow observation of the parity-dependent
unidirectional and chiral energy transfer and thus provide a useful cell for
building up nonreciprocal array and realizing topological, e.g., isolators,
circulators, or amplifiers.

designed and dedicated to tackle physics-related problems with interpretable

the majority of existing work employs standard regularisation practices. In our

propose the ""eigeninit"" initialisation scheme that samples initial Koopman

""eigenloss"" penalty scheme that penalises the eigenvalues of the Koopman

find on these datasets that eigenloss and eigeninit improves the convergence

range of effective temperatures agrees well with theoretical models. On the
other hand, the characteristics of the pulsation spectra are varied and do not
correlate with stellar temperature, calling into question the existence of a
useful nu_max relation for delta Scutis, at least for young stars. By including
delta Scuti stars observed in the Kepler field, we show that the instability

IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation regarding the evolution of the matter
content of satellites, focusing on a population that are accreted at $z>1$ and
retain their identity as satellites down to $z=0$. At fixed host halo mass, the
amount of DM and stellar mass stripped depends mostly on the pericentric
distance, $d_{\rm peri}$, here normalised by host halo virial radius. The
closest encounters result in significant loss of DM, with subhaloes retaining
between 20 and a few per cent of their $z=1$ mass. At fixed $d_{\rm peri}$, DM
mass stripping seems more severe in lower mass haloes. Conversely, the average
satellite in higher mass haloes has its stellar mass growth halted earlier,
having lost a higher fraction of stellar mass by $z=0$. We also show that mass
stripping has a strong impact on the quenched fractions. The IllustrisTNG boxes
are qualitatively consistent in these predictions, with quantitative
differences mostly originating from the distinct subhalo mass ranges covered by
the boxes. Finally, we have identified DM-deficient systems in all TNG boxes.
These objects are preferentially found in massive clusters ($M_{\rm host }
\gtrsim 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$), had very close encounters with their central
galaxies ($d_{\rm peri}\simeq0.05\, R_{\rm vir}$), and were accreted at high
redshift ($z_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 1.4$), reinforcing the notion that tidal
stripping is responsible for their remarkable lack of DM.

representation, and by adding several types of new valid inequalities. In
particular, we derive a novel kind of ""on/off cycle-based polynomial
constraints"", by taking advantage of the network structure. Those constraints
are linearized using convex-hull representations and implemented in an
efficient ""branch-and-cut"" framework. We also tighten the relaxation using the
optimization-based bound tightening algorithm. Our extensive numerical
experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show that, compared with the

Nanoscale control over the conductivity of the LAO/STO interface enables

nematicity in quasi-1D ballistic nanoscale LAO/STO Hall crosses. The
characteristic magnetic field at which the Hall coefficient changes directly
coincides with the depairing of non-superconducting pairs showing a strong

coincides with the electron pairing transition, unveiling a rotational symmetry
breaking due to the transition from paired to unpaired phases at the interface.
The results presented here highlights the influence of preformed electron pairs

Speed, accuracy, and scalability are three desirables for any inverse design
tool to sample efficiently across such a vast space. While traditional global
optimization approaches (e.g., evolutionary algorithm, random sampling based)
have demonstrated the ability to predict new crystal structures that can be
used as super-hard materials, semiconductors, and photovoltaic materials to
name a few, it is highly desirable to develop approaches that converge faster
to the solution, have better solution quality, and are scalable to high
dimensionality. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are emerging as powerful
design tools capable of addressing these issues but primarily operate in
discrete action space. In this work, we introduce CASTING, which is an RL-based
scalable framework for crystal structure, topology, and potentially
microstructure prediction. CASTING employs an RL-based continuous search space
decision tree (MCTS -Monte Carlo Tree Search) algorithm with three important
modifications (i) a modified rewards scheme for improved search space
exploration (ii) a 'windowing' or 'funneling' scheme for improved exploitation
and (iii) adaptive sampling during playouts for efficient and scalable search.
Using a set of representative examples ranging from metals such as Ag to
covalent systems such as C and multicomponent systems (graphane, boron nitride,
and complex correlated oxides), we demonstrate the accuracy, the speed of
convergence, and the scalability of CASTING to discover new metastable crystal
structures and phases that meet the target objective.

systematical research of CrGeTe3 (CGT) bilayer and multilayers with s of
self-intercalated (SI) Cr atom, we find that self-intercalation can enhance the
interlayer magnetic coupling. The super-exchange interaction still dominates
interlayer magnetic exchange interaction, which results in ferromagnetic
coupling between neighboring vdW layers. CGT bilayer keeps HM with FM order
after Cr self-intercalation, independent of self-intercalated Cr (CrSI) atoms'
concentration. Most importantly, self-intercalated CrGeTe3 (SI-CGT) bilayers
show ferromagnetic HM, independent of stacking orders. Moreover, SI-CGT
multilayers keep FM order, independent of films' thickness. However, SI-CGT
multilayers transform from HM into normal spin-polarized metal, as the states
at the Fermi-level increases. Moreover, magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of
SI-CGT-AA and SI-CGT-AB are -0.160 and -0.42 meV/.f.u., which are modulated by
CrSI atoms. The MAE of SI-CGT-AA and SI-CGT-AB are different, as the
hybridization interaction between Cr's d orbitals is different. SI-CGT
multilayers' magnetic easy axis (EA) switches from [001] of CGT to [100]
direction, independent of stacking orders. It origins that MAE mainly
contributed by hybridization between Te atoms' px and py, py and pz orbitals is
obvious weakened as CrSI is introduced. SI-CGT multilayers show good dynamical,
thermal, and magnetic stability at 300 and 500 K. These findings find a
promising way to manipulate interlayer exchange interaction and magnetoelectric

curves of the optimal lift and the optimal lift-to-drag ratio regions are
constructed. A phase diagram for the mean drag coefficient is divided into the
drag enhancement and reduction regions by an angle of attack of 20 degrees. The
aerodynamic characteristics of the flexible membrane wing are compared with
those of its rigid flat and rigid cambered counterparts within the range from 4
degrees to 90 degrees. Three regimes are systematically studied using the
numerical simulations namely the pre-stall, the transitional stall, and the

angles of attack below and above the critical angle of attack of 20 degrees.
Scaling relations for the mean membrane responses and the unsteady aerodynamic

triangle-free graphs constructed as coset graphs of binary linear codes.
Previously it was shown that there are infinite families of binary storage
codes on coset graphs with rate converging to 3/4. Here we show that codes on
such graphs can attain rate asymptotically approaching 1.
  Equivalently, this question can be phrased as a version of hat-guessing games
on graphs (e.g., P.J. Cameron e.a., \emph{Electronic J. Comb.} 2016). In this
language, we construct triangle-free graphs with success probability of the
players approaching one as the number of vertices tends to infinity.
Equivalently again, there exist linear index codes on such graphs of rate
approaching zero.

unique property, one can often find exotic thickness-dependent electronic
properties from these quasi-2D vdW materials, which can lead to band gap
opening, emerging superconductivity, or enhanced charge density waves with
decreasing thickness. Surface-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can

challenging to preserve the intrinsic surfaces of air-sensitive quasi-2D

after exfoliation are extremely hard to explore with a typical STM setup due to
their small size (< 10 {\mu}m). Here, we present a straightforward method
compatible with any STM setup having optical access: (1) exfoliating and/or

ultra-high vacuum STM chamber using a suitcase without exposure to air, and (3)
navigating surface to locate exfoliated vdW 2D flakes with different

distinct TSs located at different high-symmetry points in the first Brillouin
zone of T-graphene, which enables controlled topological charge conversion in
the same lattice. We show active manipulation of the TS mapping, turning the
two TSs into vortices of different helicities, or one into a high-order vortex

suggests that its temporal evolution is exponential, and dependents on the

magnetic field with respect to the electric field decides whether the
contribution of magnetic forces opposes or aids the interfacial net electrical
force due to the electric field. Validation of the proposed model at the
asymptotic limits of vanishing magnetic field show that the model accurately
reduces to the case of transient electrohydrodynamic model. We also propose a
magnetic discriminating function to quantify the steady-state droplet

change of droplets from spherical shape to prolate, and oblate spheroids,
correspond to magnetic discriminating function >0 and <0 regimes, respectively.
It is shown that with the aid of low magnitude magnetic field, a substantial

within and around the droplet is achieved. The analysis also reveals the
deformation lag and specific critical parameters that aid or suppressed this

criteria. We conclude that the observed $X_c(3872)$ and $Z_c(3900)$ are
tetramoles states (superposition of quasi-degenerated molecule and tetraquark
states having similar couplings to the currents) with the predicted masses:
$M_{{\cal T}_{X_c}}=3876(44)$ MeV and $M_{{\cal T}_{Z_c}}=3900(42)$ MeV. We
also do an extensive analysis of the four-quark nature of different $T_{QQ\bar
q\bar q'}$ axial-vector states. Then, combining ${\cal R}$ and DRSR, we
reanalyze the observed state $X_c(3872)$ and we obtain a precise prediction of
$M_{T_{cc}^{1^+}}$=3886(6) MeV. Extending to the beauty sector, we find the
results: $M_{{\cal T}_{Z_b}}=10579(99)$ MeV and $M_{X_b}=10545(131)$ MeV.
Finally, we confront our combined LSR $\oplus$ DRSR results with the ones from
some other approaches (lattices and quark models).

estimate their mastery levels on a set of pre-defined skills, based on which
the corresponding future performance can be accurately predicted. As an
important way of providing personalized experience for online education, KT has
gained increased attention in recent years. In practice, a student's learning
history comprises answers to sets of massed questions, each known as a session,
rather than merely being a sequence of independent answers. Theoretically,
within and across these sessions, students' learning dynamics can be very
different. Therefore, how to effectively model the dynamics of students'
knowledge states within and across the sessions is crucial for handling the KT
problem. Most existing KT models treat student's learning records as a single
continuing sequence, without capturing the sessional shift of students'
knowledge state. To address the above issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
transformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an interaction(-level) encoder to
capture the knowledge a student acquires within a session, and a
session(-level) encoder to summarise acquired knowledge across the past
sessions. To predict an interaction in the current session, a knowledge
retriever integrates the summarised past-session knowledge with the previous
interactions' information into proper knowledge representations. These
representations are then used to compute the student's current knowledge state.
Additionally, to model the student's long-term forgetting behaviour across the
sessions, a power-law-decay attention mechanism is designed and deployed in the
session encoder, allowing it to emphasize more on the recent sessions.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HiTSKT achieves
new state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets compared with six
state-of-the-art KT models.

properties of NOMA are revealed: When users' target rates satisfy certain
conditions, the channel state information (CSI) is not required by PA-DOS to
minimize the system outage probability, and different users' outage
probabilities can be minimized simultaneously; When such conditions are not
satisfied, the opposite situation occurs. Following these properties, two
PA-DOS strategies are designed regarding distinct user priorities, which ensure
the minimization of the system outage probability and the user outage
probability of the high-priority user. Especially, these strategies do not
require CSI or only require one-bit CSI feedback depending on users' target
rates. Analytical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the
proposed strategies significantly outperform the existing strategies in terms
of both system and user outage performance. Furthermore, the results show that
although under some target rates the minimum user outage probabilities cannot

Model (SM) predictions, which illustrate the fact that the concept of lepton
flavor universality (LFU) is violated in semileptonic $B$ meson as well as
leptonic $\Upsilon(ns)(n=1,2,3)$ decays. Recently BaBar experiment announced
that at $1.8\sigma$ level, $R_\Upsilon(3s)= {\rm Br}(\Upsilon(3s) \to \tau
\bar{\tau})/{\rm Br}(\Upsilon(3s) \to \mu \bar{\mu})$ shows an acceptance with
the SM. These fascinating findings point towards the possible implication of
new physics in the $b \to c \tau \bar{\nu}$ transitions, which in turn, creates
a new direction to look for new physics in $b \bar{b} \to \tau \bar{\tau} $
process. Thereby, the new physics contributions to the $b \to c \tau \bar{\nu}$
process would inevitably alter the $b \bar{b} \to \tau \bar{\tau} $
transitions. Here we conduct a $\chi^{2}$ fit to constraining the new
parameters by using the measured values of $ R_D$, $R{_D*}$, $ R_{J/ \psi}$, $
R_{X_C}$, $F_L (D^*)$ and $P_{\tau} (D^*)$. In this context, we investigate the
effect of constrained new physics couplings on the branching ratios and LFU
parameters $R_{\Upsilon(ns)}$ through leptoquark models such as $S_3,
\tilde{S_1}, \tilde{R_2}, U_1, U_3 $ and $ V_2$.

energy balance equation is derived that accounts for multiple material phases
and interfaces present within a moving control volume. This balance is applied
to a control volume that is anchored to a three phase contact line as it
advances over the surface of a rough and chemically homogeneous solid. Using
semi-quantitative models for the material behaviour occurring within the
control volume, an order-of-magnitude analysis is performed to find what terms
within the balance are significant, producing an equation that can be used to
predict contact angle hysteresis from a knowledge of interface dynamics
occurring around the three phase contact line. In addition to this equation,
the theory also answers several questions that have been discussed within the
wetting literature: Namely that (static) contact angle hysteresis is a function
of conditions around the three phase contact line, as opposed to the
surrounding flow system; That contact angle hysteresis results from interface
`jumps' that dissipate energy, rather than directly from contact line
deformation; That interfacial dynamics is required to predict contact angle
hysteresis, but that these dynamics should be interpreted via energy
conservation, and; That dynamic contact angles depend on kinetic energy
transport around the three phase contact line, as well as local energy
dissipation. The framework has been derived using assumptions of incompressible
Newtonian fluids, reversible interface formation and zero-strain solids --
future work could relax these assumptions to make the theory more generally
applicable.

With the obtained experimental data, parameters such as heat release rate,
combustion stages, thermal efficiency, indicated mean effective pressure

is known as SATCON . In the current study, an effort was undertaken to assess
how well the SATCON approach performed for estimating TC intensity throughout
the west pacific basin from year 2017 to 2021. To do this, 26 TCs over the west
pacific basin were analysed using the SATCON-based technique, and the estimates
were compared to the best track predictions provided by the Regional

winds (Vmax) and estimated central pressures (ECP) for various ``T"" numbers and
types of storm throughout the entire year as well as during the pre-monsoon

compared to weaker and very strong TCs, the ability of the SATCON algorithm to
estimate intensity is determined to be rather excellent for mid-range TCs. We
demonstrate that SATCON is more effective in the post-monsoon across the west

engineering task of arbitrary quantum state in $c$-partite $d$-dimensional
system, both of which are based on discrete-time quantum walk with a
$2^c$-dimensional time- and position-dependent coin. The first procedure is a
$d$-step quantum walk where all the $d$ coins are non-identity, while the
second procedure is an $O(d)$-step quantum walk where only $O(\log d)$ coins
are non-identity. A concrete example of preparing generalized Bell states is
given to demonstrate the first scheme we proposed. We also show how these
schemes can be used to reduce the cost of long-distance quantum communication
when the particles involved in the system are far away from each other.
Furthermore, the first scheme can be applied to give an alternative approach to
the quantum state preparation problem which is one of the fundamental tasks of
quantum information processing. We design circuits for quantum state

natural and industrial contexts. For example, many biological tissues
experience periodic compression due to natural pulsation or basic biomechanical
function. This loading can have practical implications for the stimulation of
cell growth, the evolution of material structure through degradation or
consolidation, and the transport of waste, nutrients, and contaminants.
However, the detailed flow and mechanics of these deformations have not yet
been systematically investigated. Here, we fill this gap by identifying and
exploring the complete parameter space associated with periodic deformations in
the context of a 1D model problem. We use large-deformation poroelasticity to
consider a wide range of loading periods and amplitudes. We identify two
distinct mechanical regimes, distinguished by whether the loading period is
slow or fast relative to the characteristic poroelastic timescale. We develop
analytical solutions for slow loading at any amplitude and for infinitesimal
amplitude at any period. We use these analytical solutions and a full numerical
solution to explore the emergence of nonlinear effects as the amplitude
increases and the localisation of the deformation near the permeable boundary
as the period decreases. We show that the latter effect leads to asymmetry
between the loading and unloading phases of each cycle in terms of the
distributions of porosity and fluid flux.

on an offline dataset collected a priori. The offline setting presents two
challenges: (i) We cannot collect Bob's private information, leading to a
confounding bias when using standard RL methods, and (ii) a distributional
mismatch between the behavior policy used to collect data and the desired

action as an instrumental variable for Alice's current decision making so as to
adjust for the unmeasured confounding. We develop a novel identification result

approaches. However, code review comments are also rich sources that may
contain extensive discussions regarding architecture violations. In this work,
we investigated the characteristics of architecture violation symptoms in code
review comments from the developers' perspective. We employed a set of keywords
related to violation symptoms to collect 606 (out of 21,583) code review
comments from four popular OSS projects in the OpenStack and Qt communities. We
manually analyzed the collected 606 review comments to provide the categories
and linguistic patterns of violation symptoms, as well as the reactions how
developers addressed them. Our findings show that: (1) 10 categories of
violation symptoms are discussed by developers during the code review process;
(2) The frequently-used terms of expressing violation symptoms are
""inconsistent"" and ""violate"", and the most frequently-used linguistic pattern
is Problem Discovery; (3) Refactoring and removing code are the major measures
(90%) to tackle violation symptoms, while a few violation symptoms were ignored
by developers. Our findings suggest that the investigation of violation
symptoms can help researchers better understand the characteristics of
architecture erosion and facilitate the development and maintenance activities,

implications. Adopting the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum
physics, we argue that there is no Born rule at the fundamental level of
quantum gravity with a non-normalisable Wheeler-DeWitt wave functional $\Psi$.
Instead the universe is in a perpetual state of quantum nonequilibrium with a
probability density $P\neq\left\vert \Psi\right\vert ^{2}$. Dynamical
relaxation to the Born rule can occur only after the early universe has emerged
into a semiclassical or Schr\""{o}dinger approximation, with a time-dependent
and normalisable wave functional $\psi$, for non-gravitational systems on a
classical spacetime background. In that regime the probability density $\rho$
can relax towards $\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$ (on a coarse-grained
level). Thus the pilot-wave theory of gravitation supports the hypothesis of
primordial quantum nonequilibrium, with relaxation to the Born rule taking
place soon after the big bang. We also show that quantum-gravitational
corrections to the Schr\""{o}dinger approximation allow quantum nonequilibrium
$\rho\neq\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$ to be created from a prior
equilibrium ($\rho=\left\vert \psi\right\vert ^{2}$) state. Such effects are
very tiny and difficult to observe in practice.

non-trivial for cloud application operators. As cloud applications

distinct levels of system behavior: the end-to-end application latency and

challenging because user requests traverse heterogeneous services that

presents Autothrottle, a bi-level learning-assisted resource management

mechanisms of application SLO feedback and service resource control, and
bridges them with the notion of performance targets. This decoupling enables
targeted control policies for these two mechanisms, where we combine
lightweight heuristics and learning techniques. We evaluate Autothrottle on
three microservice applications, with workload traces from production

to parametrizations that are widely obtained in practical scenarios when

introduce a new ""linearizability"" assumption that a mapping from
overparametrized vector of parameters $\Theta \left( \theta \right)$ to

Under such assumption and weak requirement of the regressor finite excitation,
on the basis of dynamic regressor extension and mixing technique we propose a
procedure to reduce the nonlinear regression equation to the linear
parameterization without application of singularity causing operations and the
need to identify the overparametrized parameters vector. As a result, an
estimation law with exponential convergence rate is derived, which, unlike
known solutions, ($\textit{i}$) does not require a strict

extreme switches was considered in a recent paper. In the present work, we
study the same model with disorder. Here disorder implies that negative
interactions may occur with a probability $p$. In absence of extreme switches,
the known critical point is at $p_c =1/4$ in the mean field model. With a
nonzero value of $q$ that denotes the probability of such switches, the
critical point is found to occur at $ p = \frac{1-q}{4}$ where the order
parameter vanishes with a universal value of the exponent $\beta =1/2$.
Stability analysis of initially ordered states near the phase boundary reveals
the exponential growth/decay of the order parameter in the ordered/disordered
phase with a timescale diverging with exponent $1$. The fully ordered state
also relaxes exponentially to its equilibrium value with a similar behaviour of
the associated timescale. Exactly at the critical points, the order parameter
shows a power law decay with time with exponent $1/2$. Although the critical
behaviour remains mean field like, the system behaves more like a two state
model as $q \to 1$. At $q=1$ the model behaves like a binary voter model with
random flipping occurring with probability $p$.

between cluster environment and $\rm H_2$ content of star-forming galaxies at
redshifts spanning $0\leq z\leq 1$. To do so, we divide the star-forming sample
into those that are bound to clusters and those that are not. We find that, at
any given redshift, the galaxies in clusters generally have less $\rm H_2$ than
their non-cluster counterparts with the same stellar mass (corresponding to an
offset of $\lesssim 0.5$ dex), but this offset varies with stellar mass and is
virtually absent at $M_\star\lesssim10^{9.3}~{\rm M}_\odot$. The $\rm H_2$
deficit in star-forming cluster galaxies can be traced back to a decline in
their $\rm H_2$ content that commenced after first infall into a cluster, which
occurred later than a typical cluster galaxy. Evolution of the full cluster
population after infall is generally consistent with `slow-then-rapid'
quenching, but galaxies with $M_\star\lesssim 10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_\odot$ exhibit
rapid quenching. Unlike most cluster galaxies, star-forming ones were not
pre-processed in groups prior to being accreted by clusters. For both of these
cluster samples, the star formation efficiency remained oblivious to the
infall. We track the particles associated with star-forming cluster galaxies
and attribute the drop in $\rm H_2$ mass after infall to poor replenishment,
depletion due to star formation, and stripping of $\rm H_2$ in cluster
environments. These results provide predictions for future surveys, along with
support and theoretical insights for existing molecular gas observations that
suggest there is less $\rm H_2$ in cluster galaxies.

to value the properties on the market. Traditional methods perform appraisal
based on the domain knowledge, but suffer from the efforts of hand-crafted

relation between target transaction and surrounding neighbors with the
attention mechanism. To model the influence between communities, we integrate
the environmental information and the past price of each transaction from other

bipartite maps, which are bipartite graphs embedded on surfaces. Maps are known
to appear in many areas of theoretical physics and discrete mathematics, but
one key interest for fundamental computer science is how multi-facetted they
are in the sense that multiple encodings exist which are not interchangeable,
like Tutte's/loop equations, the topological recursion, the KP hierarchy and
numerous bijections which made the field so rich. One generalization we
considered is weighted Hurwitz numbers, including constellations, monotone
Hurwitz numbers and the unoriented versions of Chapuy-Do\l\k{e}ga. We have
investigated whether some universal structures of maps lift to weighted Hurwitz
numbers, such that the topological recursion (it does, for oriented, double,
weighted Hurwitz numbers), and the passage from the KP to the BKP hierarchy for
some unoriented weighted Hurwitz numbers (like monotone ones). The other
generalization of bipartite maps we considered is colored triangulations in
dimensions three and higher. They provide a nice meeting ground for topology
and combinatorics, where universality classes above dimension 2 can be
investigated. In particular, we found that the gluings of 3-balls which
maximize the number of edges at fixed number of tetrahedra are in bijection
with trees. In even dimensions however, we found that more universality classes
can be reached depending on the choice of building blocks. We also wondered
whether some of the universal structures featured by maps lift to higher
dimensions. In particular, we proved instances of the scheme decomposition in
three-dimensional models and maps decorated with crossing loops, and we proved
the blobbed topological recursion with only mild assumptions.

with an optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functional to investigate the
electronic and excited-state structure of the primary six pigments in the
reaction center of \textit{Rhodobacter sphaeroides}. By explicitly including
amino-acid residues surrounding these six pigments in our TDDFT calculations,
we systematically study the effect of the protein environment on energy and
charge-transfer excitations. Our calculations show that a forward charge
transfer into the A branch is significantly lower in energy than the first
charge transfer into the B branch, in agreement with the unidirectional charge
transfer observed experimentally. We further show that inclusion of the protein
environment redshifts this excitation significantly, allowing for energy
transfer from the coupled $Q_x$ excitations. Through analysis of transition and
difference densities, we demonstrate that most of the $Q$-band excitations are
strongly delocalized over several pigments and that both their spatial
delocalization and charge-transfer character determine how strongly affected
they are by thermally-activated molecular vibrations. Our results suggest a
mechanism for charge-transfer in this bacterial reaction center and pave the
way for further first-principles investigations of the interplay between
delocalized excited states, vibronic coupling, and the role of the protein

distribution of a set of unknowns, given indirect measurements. For
non-linear/non-Gaussian problems, analytic solutions are seldom available:
Sequential Monte Carlo samplers offer a powerful tool for approximating complex
posteriors, by constructing an auxiliary sequence of densities that smoothly
reaches the posterior. Often the posterior depends on a scalar hyper-parameter.
In this work, we show that properly designed Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
samplers naturally provide an approximation of the marginal likelihood
associated with this hyper-parameter for free, i.e. at a negligible additional
computational cost. The proposed method proceeds by constructing the auxiliary
sequence of distributions in such a way that each of them can be interpreted as
a posterior distribution corresponding to a different value of the
hyper-parameter. This can be exploited to perform selection of the
hyper-parameter in Empirical Bayes approaches, as well as averaging across
values of the hyper-parameter according to some hyper-prior distribution in
Fully Bayesian approaches. For FB approaches, the proposed method has the
further benefit of allowing prior sensitivity analysis at a negligible
computational cost. In addition, the proposed method exploits particles at all
the (relevant) iterations, thus alleviating one of the known limitations of SMC
samplers, i.e. the fact that all samples at intermediate iterations are
typically discarded. We show numerical results for two distinct cases where the
hyper-parameter affects only the likelihood: a toy example, where an SMC
sampler is used to approximate the full posterior distribution; and a brain
imaging example, where a Rao-Blackwellized SMC sampler is used to approximate
the posterior distribution of a subset of parameters in a conditionally linear
Gaussian model.

plastic profiles from molten polymer. Especially interesting is the design of
the die, through which the melt is pressed to attain the desired shape.
However, due to an inhomogeneous velocity distribution at the die exit or
residual stresses inside the extrudate, the final shape of the manufactured
part often deviates from the desired one. To avoid these deviations, the shape
of the die can be computationally optimized, which has already been
investigated in the literature using classical optimization approaches.
  A new approach in the field of shape optimization is the utilization of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a learning-based optimization algorithm. RL is
based on trial-and-error interactions of an agent with an environment. For each
action, the agent is rewarded and informed about the subsequent state of the
environment. While not necessarily superior to classical, e.g., gradient-based
or evolutionary, optimization algorithms for one single problem, RL techniques
are expected to perform especially well when similar optimization tasks are
repeated since the agent learns a more general strategy for generating optimal
shapes instead of concentrating on just one single problem.
  In this work, we investigate this approach by applying it to two 2D test
cases. The flow-channel geometry can be modified by the RL agent using
so-called Free-Form Deformation, a method where the computational mesh is
embedded into a transformation spline, which is then manipulated based on the
control-point positions. In particular, we investigate the impact of utilizing
different agents on the training progress and the potential of wall time saving
by utilizing multiple environments during training.

optimization of experiments. In this work, we address this need by presenting
our development of a machine learning-based modeling framework for the
BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system. This work represents an improvement over
previous efforts, which either focused on the matrix-multiplication mode of
BrainScaleS-2 or lacked full automation. Our framework, called hxtorch.snn,
enables the hardware-in-the-loop training of spiking neural networks within
PyTorch, including support for auto differentiation in a fully-automated
hardware experiment workflow. In addition, hxtorch.snn facilitates seamless
transitions between emulating on hardware and simulating in software. We
demonstrate the capabilities of hxtorch.snn on a classification task using the
Yin-Yang dataset employing a gradient-based approach with surrogate gradients
and densely sampled membrane observations from the BrainScaleS-2 hardware
system.

further reduce traffic fatalities with other (potentially vulnerable) traffic
participants by using relatively small lateral deviations to realize
collision-free behavior. In this work, a complete and tractable software
architecture is presented for such an AES system, comprising of the estimation
of the vehicles capabilities, planning a set of paths which exploit these
capabilities, checking the feasibility and risk of these paths and eventually
triggering the decision to drive along one of these paths, i.e., initiating an
AES manoeuvre. A novel methodology is provided to trigger such an AES system,
which is based on a time-to-evade (TTE) notion. In the presence of time-varying
uncertainties or measurement inaccuracies, the system is able to replan the
path from the previously chosen path to ensure collision-free behavior. The
proposed architecture and control approach is validated using a simulation
study and field tests, showing the effectiveness of the architecture and its
sub-components.

On curved surfaces mimicking the morphologies of Hydra in various stages of

$\pi_1(X)$ in the presence of a linear representation $\varrho: \pi_1(X) \to
{\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. We present our main results in three parts.
  Firstly, we show that if $\varrho$ is bigand the Zariski closure of
$\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ semisimple, then for any
$X^\sigma:=X\times_\sigma\mathbb{C}$ where $\sigma\in {\rm
Aut}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q})$, there exists a proper Zariski closed subset $Z
\subsetneqq X^\sigma$ such that any closed irreducible subvariety $V$ of
$X^\sigma$ not contained in $Z$ is of log general type, and any holomorphic map
from the punctured disk $\mathbb{D}^*$ to $X^\sigma$ with image not contained
in $Z$ does not have an essential singularity at the origin. In particular, all
entire curves in $X^\sigma$ lie on $Z$. We provide examples to illustrate the
optimality of this condition.
  Secondly, assuming that $\varrho$ is big and reductive, we prove the
generalized Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture for $X^\sigma$. Furthermore, if
$\varrho$ is large, we show that the special subsets of $X^\sigma$ that capture
the non-hyperbolicity locus of $X^\sigma$ from different perspectives are
equal, and this subset is proper if and only if $X$ is of log general type.
  Lastly, we prove that if $X$ is a special quasi-projective manifold in the
sense of Campana or $h$-special, then $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually
nilpotent. We provides examples to demonstrate that this result is sharp and
thus revise Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective
varieties.
  To prove these theorems, we develop new features in non-abelian Hodge theory,
geometric group theory, and Nevanlinna theory. Some byproducts are obtained.

Moreover, obtaining a birefringent tomogram is more arduous for thick samples,
where multiple light scattering should also be considered. In this study, we
developed a new dielectric tensor tomography algorithm that enables full
characterization of highly scattering birefringent samples by solving the

importance in countless physical processes. Yet, the behavior of ionic
conductors out of thermal equilibrium has to date mainly been studied in the
context of thermodiffusion phenomena by virtue of direct extensions of
Debye-H\""uckel theories. We investigate how the static response of a symmetric
ionic fluid is influenced by the presence of a thermal gradient by introducing
a theory of electrostatic screening under a stationary temperature profile. By
borrowing mathematical methods commonly used in the semiclassical approximation
of quantum particles, we find analytical solutions to the asymptotic decay of
the charge density which can be used to describe the non-equilibrium response
of the system to external charge perturbations and for arbitrary ionic
concentrations. Notably, a transition between monotonic and oscillatory
screening regimes is observed as an effect of the temperature variation which
generalizes known results of thermal equilibrium to out of equilibrium
conditions. A final quantitative example on the screening of charged surfaces
in aqueous electrolytes shows that the deviation from thermal equilibrium
predicted by our solutions is generally larger than thermodiffusion effects,
and should therefore be taken into account for a comprehensive description of
the electrical double layer. Our findings pave the way to the rigorous
treatment of non-equilibrium steady states in ionic systems with potential
applications to the study of energy materials, nanostructured systems and
waste-heat-recovery technologies.

quickly followed by the demonstration of coherent oscillations, tunable dipolar

leaving only a draw or a loss as possibilities for the opponent, assuming both
the players play optimally. Thus on average majority of the games played result
in a draw. The majority of the latest research on how to solve a tic tac toe
board state employs strategies such as Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks,
Co-Evolution, and Evolutionary Programming. But these approaches deal with a
trivial board state of 3X3 and very little research has been done for a
generalized algorithm to solve 4X4,5X5,6X6 and many higher states. Even though
an algorithm exists which is Min-Max but it takes a lot of time in coming up
with an ideal move due to its recursive nature of implementation. A Sample has
been created on this link \url{https://bk-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/} to prove
this fact. This is the main problem that this study is aimed at solving i.e
providing a generalized algorithm(Approximate method, Learning-Based) for
higher board states of tic tac toe to make precise moves in a short period.
Also, the code changes needed to accommodate higher board states will be
nominal. The idea is to pose the tic tac toe game as a well-posed learning
problem. The study and its results are promising, giving a high win to draw
ratio with each epoch of training. This study could also be encouraging for
other researchers to apply the same algorithm to other similar board games like
Minesweeper, Chess, and GO for finding efficient strategies and comparing the
results.

performing numerical simulations with the stochastic (projected)

characteristic relaxation frequency (or, critical slowing down), we identify a
finite temperature critical line for the transition. We find that the critical
point shifts linearly with temperature and, in addition, the three quantities
used to probe the transition exhibit a temperature power-law scaling. The
scaling of the critical slowing down is found to be consistent with thermal
critical exponents and is very well approximated by the square of the spin
excitation gap at the zero-temperature.

flow of elongated gas bubbles travelling through liquid-filled square
capillaries under high Weber number conditions. These conditions consistently
induce the formation of a re-entrant jet at the back of the bubble that
commonly gives way to a deep liquid cavity. Subsequent steps include pinch-off
events in the cavity to generate one or multiple encapsulated drops which may
coalesce, in conjunction with the bursting of the bubble-liquid interface by
either the cavity or the drops. Some of these interfacial instabilities have
previously been reported experimentally (Olbricht 1996) and numerically
(Izbassarov & Muradoglu 2016) for liquid-liquid flow in microchannels. We carry
out three-dimensional direct numerical simulations based on a hybrid
interface-tracking/level-set method capable of accounting for the presence and
dynamic exchange of surfactants between the liquid bulk phase and the
liquid-gas interface. Our results indicate that the delicate interplay amongst
inertia, capillarity, viscosity, surfactant adsorption/desorption kinetics, and
Marangoni stresses has a dramatic influence over the non-axisymmetric
morphological structures of the encapsulated drops-elongated bubble. This
strong coupling also influences the pinch-off time, penetration depth of the
cavity, and number, size, and velocity of the encapsulated drops across the
bubble. The observed phenomena are summarised in three main morphological
regimes based on surfactant-related parameters and dimensionless groups. A
discussion of the flow regime maps is also provided.

demands a Hamiltonian paradifferential Birkhoff normal form reduction for
quasi-linear PDEs in presence of resonant wave interactions: the normal form
may be not integrable but it preserves the Sobolev norms thanks to its
Hamiltonian nature. A major difficulty is that usual paradifferential calculus
used to prove local well posedness (as the celebrated Alinhac good unknown)
does not preserve the Hamiltonian structure. A major novelty of this paper is
to develop an algorithmic perturbative procedure \`a la Darboux to correct
usual paradifferential transformations to symplectic maps, up to an arbitrary
degree of homogeneity. The symplectic correctors turn out to be smoothing
perturbations of the identity, and therefore only slightly modify the
paradifferential structure of the equations. The Darboux procedure which
recovers the nonlinear Hamiltonian structure is written in an abstract
functional setting, in order to be applicable also in other contexts.

transition only emerges with large system sizes. It is also intuitively
expected that for other geometries, the types of the associated phase
transitions should be identical to that of the square lattice. However, after

introduces correlations between neighboring sites. We study the resulting
effects on surface coverage dynamics for reversible dissociative adsorption of
dimers on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice system consisting of independent
strips of reactive sites. We first show that the effect of finite system size
on surface coverage dynamics becomes significant when dissociative adsorption
is much slower or faster than the corresponding associative desorption. To this
end, we derive analytic formulas for the equilibrium surface coverage and the
correlation coefficient for the occupancy of neighboring sites as a function of
system size (more specifically, the number of reactive sites in a strip) and
the ratio of the adsorption and desorprtion rates. Second, we show that the
validity of cluster-expansion-based approximations also largely depends on the
ratio of adsorption and desorprtion rates. While the mean-field approximation
and pair approximation predict the correct equilibrium surface coverage, they
fail to predict the temporal growth of the surface coverage from an initially
unoccupied lattice when adsorption is much slower than desorption. This implies
that site correlation cannot be naively ignored nor approximated using a simple
expression during a nonequilibrium process of dissociative adsorption. We show
that the surface diffusion of adsorbed atoms can reduce correlations between
sites and the fast-diffusion limit can be described by the mean-field
approximation that assumes there is no correlation between sites. We also
present kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results for the validation of our
analytic results as well as the comparison of the surface coverage growth with
the cluster-expansion-based approximations.

characterize the two deloaclizateon transitions. It finds that the

differential equations arising in cardiac cell-by-cell models. The latter are
different from the classical Bidomain and Monodomain cardiac models based on
homogenized descriptions of the cardiac tissue at the macroscopic level, and
therefore they allow the representation of individual cardiac cells, cell
aggregates, damaged tissues and nonuniform distributions of ion channels on the
cell membrane. The resulting discrete cell-by-cell models have discontinuous
global solutions across the cell boundaries, hence the proposed BDDC
preconditioner is based on appropriate dual and primal spaces with additional
constraints which transfer information between cells (subdomains) without
influencing the overall discontinuity of the global solution. A scalable
convergence rate bound is proved for the resulting BDDC cell-by-cell
preconditioned operator, while numerical tests validate this bound and
investigate its dependence on the discretization parameters.

offer configuration settings to adjust a database's behavior and performance to

to be taken into account when optimizing the configuration of a NoSQL database.
This work explores Machine Learning as a means to automatically tune a NoSQL

Decision Tree Machine Learning algorithms, multiple Machine Learning models
were fitted with a training dataset that incorporates properties of the NoSQL

employed as surrogate models to optimize the Database Management System's

resulting dynamics, surprisingly, does not feature a pressure gradient, but
spring-like forces between each particle and the centroid of its cell.
  Inspired by this work, both geometrical and mechanical optimization are here

we first find a connection with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. In
what we will call the ``low-temperature limit'', we show that the requirement

$\geq10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$, and gas-to-dust ratios $\geq100$. The ISM-like
gas-to-dust ratios derived from our modeling suggest that compact,
externally-irradiated disks in the ONC are less prone to gas-phase CO depletion
than the massive and extended gas disks that are commonly found in nearby
low-mass star-forming regions. The presence of massive gas disks indicates that
external photoevaporation may have only recently begun operating in the ONC,
though it remains unclear whether other cluster members are older and more
evaporated than the ones in our sample. Finally, we compare our
dynamically-derived stellar masses with the stellar masses predicted from

feature of blazars, we have collected the long-term optical V and R band data
of 27 blazars (14 BL Lacs and 13 FSRQs), and calculated their optical spectral
indices. The results show that the spectral indices vary with respect to the
brightness for all of these blazars. In general, the optical spectrum
progressively becomes flatter (or steeper), when the brightness increases.
However the spectrum changes more and more slowly, until it tends to be stable.
In other words, the source becomes bluer (or redder) and then gradually
stabilizes when it brightens, which are briefly named the
bluer-stable-when-brighter (BSWB) and redder-stable-when-brighter (RSWB)
behaviors, respectively. Thirteen of the 14 BL Lacs show the BSWB behavior,
with an exception of AO 0235+164. On the contrary, most of FSRQs (10 out of 13)
exhibit the RSWB trend. It is confirmed that blazars follow the two universal
optical spectral behaviors, namely, BSWB and RSWB. The model of two
constant-spectral-index components can well explain the optical spectral
features qualitatively and quantitatively. The results illustrate that the
optical emission are mainly composed of two stable-color components, i.e., less
variable thermal emission and high variable synchrotron radiation. And in most
cases, the thermal component of BL Lacs is redder than that of synchrotron

been proposed but they are either too liberal or too conservative when the

applicable in real data analysis. To overcome this difficulty, a
normal-reference test is proposed and studied in this paper. It is shown that
under some regularity conditions and the null hypothesis, the proposed test
statistic and a chi-square-type mixture have the same limiting distribution. It
is then justified to approximate the null distribution of the proposed test
statistic using that of the chi-square-type mixture. The distribution of the
chi-square-type mixture can be well approximated using a three-cumulant matched
chi-square-approximation with its approximation parameters consistently
estimated from the data. The asymptotic power of the proposed test under a
local alternative is also established. Simulation studies and a real data
example demonstrate that in terms of size control, the proposed test
outperforms the existing competitors substantially.

to model the interactions among different entities, such as friendship in
social networks or protein interactions in biological graphs. A major challenge
is to understand the structure and dynamics of these systems. Although networks
evolve through time, most existing graph representation learning methods target
only static networks. Whereas approaches have been developed for the modeling
of dynamic networks, there is a lack of efficient continuous time dynamic graph
representation learning methods that can provide accurate network
characterization and visualization in low dimensions while explicitly
accounting for prominent network characteristics such as homophily and
transitivity. In this paper, we propose the Piecewise-Velocity Model (PiVeM)
for the representation of continuous-time dynamic networks. It learns dynamic
embeddings in which the temporal evolution of nodes is approximated by
piecewise linear interpolations based on a latent distance model with piecewise
constant node-specific velocities. The model allows for analytically tractable
expressions of the associated Poisson process likelihood with scalable
inference invariant to the number of events. We further impose a scalable
Kronecker structured Gaussian Process prior to the dynamics accounting for
community structure, temporal smoothness, and disentangled (uncorrelated)
latent embedding dimensions optimally learned to characterize the network
dynamics. We show that PiVeM can successfully represent network structure and
dynamics in ultra-low two-dimensional spaces. It outperforms relevant
state-of-art methods in downstream tasks such as link prediction. In summary,
PiVeM enables easily interpretable dynamic network visualizations and
characterizations that can further improve our understanding of the intrinsic
dynamics of time-evolving networks.

manufacturers to produce security arguments and evidence by carrying out
appropriate threat analysis. As key threat analysis steps, e.g., damage/threat

rigorously, security arguments lack precise guarantees, e.g., traceability
w.r.t. safety goals, especially under system updates. This article proposes
automated methods for threat analysis using a model-based engineering
methodology that provides precise guarantees with respect to safety goals. This
is accomplished by proposing an intruder model for automotive SOA which
together with the system architecture and the loss scenarios identified by
safety analysis are used as input for computing assets, impact rating,
damage/threat scenarios, and attack paths. To validate the proposed

The proposed machinery automatically enumerates several attack paths on Apollo,

one-dimensional integrable systems in quantum physics, such as ultra-cold atoms

kinetic type, where the main unknown, a statistical distribution function
$f(t,z,\theta)$, lives in a phase space which is constituted by a
one-dimensional position variable $z$, and a one-dimensional ""kinetic"" variable
$\theta$, actually a wave-vector, called ""rapidity"". Two key features of GHD
equations are first a non-local and nonlinear coupling in the advection term,
and second an infinite set of conserved quantities, which prevent the system
from thermalizing. To go beyond this, we consider the dissipative GHD
equations, which are obtained by supplementing the right-hand side of the GHD
equations with a non-local and nonlinear diffusion operator or a Boltzmann-type
collision integral. In this paper, we deal with new high-order numerical
methods to efficiently solve these kinetic equations. In particular, we devise
novel backward semi-Lagrangian methods for solving the advective part (the
so-called Vlasov equation) by using a high-order time-Taylor series expansion
for the advection fields, whose successive time derivatives are obtained by a
recursive procedure. This high-order temporal approximation of the advection
fields are used to design new implicit/explicit Runge-Kutta semi-Lagrangian
methods, which are compared to Adams-Moulton semi-Lagrangian schemes. For
solving the source terms, constituted by the diffusion and collision operators,
we use and compare different numerical methods of the literature.

across a physical barrier of higher potential energy, by traversing a
classically forbidden region, and finally escapes into another region. In an
analogous scenario, a classical particle inside a closed regular region in the

space. Here, the physical potential barrier is replaced by dynamical barriers
which separate different regions of the phase space. However, in the quantum

dynamical tunneling refers to quantum tunneling between states whose classical
limit correspond to symmetry-related regular regions separated by a chaotic

oscillations, we assert the importance of quantum coherence in enabling

and convex model shape solutions. The derived distributions of retrograde
rotation rates and pole obliquities appear to be qualitatively consistent with
outcomes of modification by thermal YORP torques. The distribution of spin
rates for the prograde rotators remains narrower than that for the retrograde
rotators; in particular, the absence of prograde rotators having periods longer
than about 20 h is real, while among the retrograde rotators are several
objects having longer periods up to about 65 h. None of the prograde objects
newly added to the sample appear to be trapped in an $s_6$ spin-orbit resonance
that is characteristic of most of the largest prograde objects; these smaller
objects either could have been trapped previously and have already evolved out,
or have experienced spin evolution tracks that did not include the resonance.

Despite minor formal differences between the two methods, both converge to the

us to derive a rigorous interpretation of the Fitness and the Complexity
metrics as the potentials of a suitable energy function. Under this
interpretation, high-energy products are unfeasible for low-fitness countries,
which explains why the algorithm is effective at displaying nested patterns in
bipartite networks. We also show that the proposed interpretation reveals the
scale invariance of the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, which has practical
implications for the algorithm's implementation in different datasets. Further,
analysis of empirical trade data under the new perspective reveals three

to reproduce high fidelity results of compressible jet flows which could be

The numerical solver is an upgrade of an existing Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes solver previously developed in the group. The original framework
is rewritten in a modern fashion and intensive parallel computation
capabilities have been added to the code. The LES formulation is written using
the finite difference approach. The energy equation is carefully discretized in
order to model the energy equation of the filtered Navier-Stokes formulation.
The classical Smagorinsky model is the chosen subgrid scale closure for the
present work. Numerical simulations of perfectly expanded jets are performed
and compared with the literature in order to validate the new solver. Moreover,
speedup and the computational performance of the code are evaluated and
discussed. Flow results are used for an initial evaluation of the noise

high peak-to-average (power) ratio (PAR), which requires linear radio-frequency
chains to avoid an increase in error-vector magnitude (EVM) and out-of-band
(OOB) emissions. In this paper, we propose a novel joint PAR reduction and
precoding algorithm that relaxes these linearity requirements in massive
multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems.
Concretely, we develop a novel alternating projections method, which limits the
PAR and transmit power increase while simultaneously suppressing MU
interference. We provide a theoretical foundation of our algorithm and provide
simulation results for a massive MU-MIMO-OFDM scenario. Our results demonstrate
significant PAR reduction while limiting the transmit power, without causing
EVM or OOB emissions.

360{\deg} omnidirectional image has been widely used, but the SOD task in
360{\deg} omnidirectional image is seldom studied due to its severe distortions

Refinement Network (MPFR-Net) to detect the salient objects in 360{\deg}
omnidirectional image. Different from the existing methods, the equirectangular
projection image and four corresponding cube-unfolding images are embedded into
the network simultaneously as inputs, where the cube-unfolding images not only
provide supplementary information for equirectangular projection image, but
also ensure the object integrity of the cube-map projection. In order to make
full use of these two projection modes, a Dynamic Weighting Fusion (DWF) module
is designed to adaptively integrate the features of different projections in a
complementary and dynamic manner from the perspective of inter and intra
features. Furthermore, in order to fully explore the way of interaction between
encoder and decoder features, a Filtration and Refinement (FR) module is
designed to suppress the redundant information between the feature itself and
the feature. Experimental results on two omnidirectional datasets demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

been gaining in popularity in recent years. While physically sound, classical
gray-box models are often cumbersome to identify and scale, and their accuracy
might be hindered by their limited expressiveness. On the other hand, classical
black-box methods, typically relying on Neural Networks (NNs) nowadays, often
achieve impressive performance, even at scale, by deriving statistical patterns
from data. However, they remain completely oblivious to the underlying physical
laws, which may lead to potentially catastrophic failures if decisions for
real-world physical systems are based on them. Physically Consistent Neural
Networks (PCNNs) were recently developed to address these aforementioned
issues, ensuring physical consistency while still leveraging NNs to attain
state-of-the-art accuracy.
  In this work, we scale PCNNs to model building temperature dynamics and
propose a thorough comparison with classical gray-box and black-box methods.
More precisely, we design three distinct PCNN extensions, thereby exemplifying
the modularity and flexibility of the architecture, and formally prove their
physical consistency. In the presented case study, PCNNs are shown to achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy, even outperforming classical NN-based models despite
their constrained structure. Our investigations furthermore provide a clear
illustration of NNs achieving seemingly good performance while remaining
completely physics-agnostic, which can be misleading in practice. While this
performance comes at the cost of computational complexity, PCNNs on the other
hand show accuracy improvements of 17-35% compared to all other physically
consistent methods, paving the way for scalable physically consistent models
with state-of-the-art performance.

quantum information hardware, and, as was recently realized, to emulate
topological materials, such as three-dimensional Weyl semimetals or
two-dimensional Chern insulators. We here show how a simple arrangement of
capacitors and conventional superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS)
junctions can realize a nonlinear capacitive element with a surprising
property: it can be quasiperiodic with respect to the quantized Cooper-pair
charge. Integrating this element into a larger circuit opens the door towards
the engineering of an even broader class of systems. First, we use it to
simulate a protected Dirac material defined in the transport degrees of
freedom. The presence of the Dirac points leads to a suppression of the
classical part of the finite-frequency current noise. Second, we exploit the
quasiperiodicity to implement the Aubry-Andr\'e model, and thereby emulate
Anderson localization in charge space. Importantly, the realization by means of
transport degrees of freedom allows for a straightforward generalization to
arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, our setup implements a truly non-interacting
version of the model, in which the macroscopic quantum mechanics of the circuit
already incorporates microscopic interaction effects. We propose that
measurements of the quantum fluctuations of the charge can be used to directly
probe the localization effect. Finally, we present an outlook in which the
nonlinear capacitance is employed in a quantum circuit emulating a magic-angle

magnetization reversal curves for initially oxidized CoSi single crystals and

strong ferromagnetic response, which is accompanied by the pronounced
modulation of the angle dependence of magnetization, as it can be expected for
easy and hard axes in a ferromagnet. In addition to the first order reversal
curves analysis, this observation allows us to distinguish between different

that the surface states-induced RKKY interaction between distorted bonds near
the sample surface is responsible for the strong ferromagnetic multi-domain

odd cycle transversal and feedback vertex set. We answer it for these two and
four further problems, namely connected vertex cover, connected domintaing set,
steiner tree, and connected odd cycle transversal. For the latter two problems
it sufficed to prove lower bounds that match the running time inherited from
parameterization by treewidth; for the others we provide faster algorithms than
relative to treewidth and prove matching lower bounds. For upper bounds we
first extend the idea of Groenland et al.~[STACS~2022] to solve what we call
coloring-like problem. Such problems are defined by a symmetric matrix $M$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$ indexed by a set of colors. The goal is to count the number
(modulo some prime $p$) of colorings of a graph such that $M$ has a $1$-entry
if indexed by the colors of the end-points of any edge. We show that this
problem can be solved faster if $M$ has small rank over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We
apply this result to get our upper bounds for connected vertex cover and
connected dominating set. The upper bounds for odd cycle transversal and
feedback vertex set use a subdivision trick to get below the bounds that matrix
rank would yield.

some parameters (which we will call auxiliary parameters) to a best estimate

of the Bayesian posterior distribution. For instance, the maximum a posteriori

stability and long-term viability in a stablecoin. This primary market AMM
(P-AMM) is an autonomous mechanism for pricing minting and redemption of
stablecoins in all possible states and is designed to achieve several desirable
properties. We first cover several case studies of current ad hoc stablecoin
issuance and redemption mechanisms, several of which have contributed to recent
stablecoin de-peggings, and formulate desirable properties of a P-AMM that
support stability and usability. We then design a P-AMM redemption curve and
show that it satisfies these properties, including bounded loss for both the
protocol and stablecoin holders. We further show that this redemption curve is
path independent and has properties of path deficiency in extended settings
involving trading fees and a separate minting curve. This means that system
health weakly improves relative to the path independent setting along any
trading curve and that there is no incentive to strategically subdivide
redemptions. Finally, we show how to implement the P-AMM efficiently on-chain.

semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. Despite their great success, they
suffer from the loss of local information at low-level layers, posing
significant challenges to accurate scene segmentation and precise object
boundary delineation. Prior works either address this issue by post-processing
or jointly learn object boundaries to implicitly improve feature encoding of
the networks. These approaches often require additional modules which are
difficult to integrate into the original architecture.
  To improve the segmentation near object boundaries, we propose a
boundary-aware feature propagation mechanism. This mechanism is achieved by
exploiting a multi-task learning framework that aims to explicitly guide the
boundaries to their original locations. With one shared encoder, our network
outputs (i) boundary localization, (ii) prediction of directions pointing to
the object's interior, and (iii) semantic segmentation, in three parallel
streams. The predicted boundaries and directions are fused to propagate the
learned features to refine the segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments
on the S3DIS and SensatUrban datasets against various baseline methods,
demonstrating that our proposed approach yields consistent improvements by
reducing boundary errors. Our code is available at

  flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first long-lived turbulent structures observable in Couette and channel
flow take the form of localized stripes, inclined with respect to the mean flow
direction. The dynamics of these stripes are central to transition, and recent
studies proposed an analogy to directed percolation where the stripes'
proliferation is ultimately responsible for turbulence to become sustained. In
the present study we focus on the internal stripe dynamics as well as on the
eventual stripe expansion, and we compare the underlying mechanisms in pressure
and shear driven planar flows, respectively plane-Poiseuille and plane-Couette
flow. Despite the similarities of the overall laminar-turbulence patterns, the
stripe proliferation processes in the two cases are fundamentally different.
Starting from the growth and sustenance of individual stripes, we find that in
Couette flow new streaks are created stochastically throughout the stripe
whereas in channel flow streak creation is deterministic and occurs locally at
the downstream tip. Because of the up/downstream symmetry, Couette stripes, in
contrast to channel stripes, have two weak and two strong laminar turbulent
interfaces. These differences in symmetry as well as in internal growth give
rise to two fundamentally different stripe splitting mechanisms. In channel
flow splitting is connected to the elongational growth of the original stripe,
and it results from a break-off / shedding of the stripe's tail. In Couette
flow splitting follows from a broadening of the original stripe and a division
along the stripe into two slimmer stripes.

systems etc. Their flexibility is high and enables to compress a surface
description before final rendering. However, computer graphics hardware
supports only triangular meshes. Therefore, four-sided bicubic patches are
approximated by a triangular mesh. The border curves of a bicubic patch are of
degree 3, while diagonal and anti-diagonal curves are of degree 6. Therefore
the resulting shape and texturing depend on the actual mapping, i.e. how the
tessellation of a bicubic patch is made. The proposed new modification of the
Hermite bicubic patch, the HS-patch, is a result of additional restriction put
on the Hermite bicubic patch formulation - the diagonal and anti-diagonal
curves are of degree 3. This requirement leads to a new Hermite based bicubic
four-sided patch with 12 control points and another 4 control points, i.e.
twist vectors, are computed from those 12 control points.

and wearable computing. With the application of deep learning (DL) techniques
such as CNN, recognizing periodic or static activities (e.g, walking, lying,
cycling, etc.) has become a well studied problem. What remains a major
challenge though is the sporadic activity recognition (SAR) problem, where
activities of interest tend to be non periodic, and occur less frequently when
compared with the often large amount of irrelevant background activities.
Recent works suggested that sequential DL models (such as LSTMs) have great
potential for modeling nonperiodic behaviours, and in this paper we studied
some LSTM training strategies for SAR. Specifically, we proposed two simple yet
effective LSTM variants, namely delay model and inverse model, for two SAR
scenarios (with and without time critical requirement). For time critical SAR,
the delay model can effectively exploit predefined delay intervals (within
tolerance) in form of contextual information for improved performance. For
regular SAR task, the second proposed, inverse model can learn patterns from
the time series in an inverse manner, which can be complementary to the forward
model (i.e.,LSTM), and combining both can boost the performance. These two LSTM
variants are very practical, and they can be deemed as training strategies
without alteration of the LSTM fundamentals. We also studied some additional
LSTM training strategies, which can further improve the accuracy. We evaluated
our models on two SAR and one non-SAR datasets, and the promising results
demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches in HAR applications.

mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) were analyzed in this study. The OCTA images
were centered on the fovea and covered a 6 mm x 6 mm area. Enface projections
of the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP)
were obtained for the quantitative OCTA feature analysis. Three quantitative
OCTA features were examined: blood vessel density (BVD), blood flow flux (BFF),
and normalized blood flow index (NBFI). Each feature was calculated from both
the SVP and DCP and their sensitivity to distinguish the three cohorts of the
study were evaluated. Results: The only quantitative feature that was capable
of distinguishing between all three cohorts was NBFI in the DCP image.
Comparative study revealed that both BVD and BFF were able to distinguish the
controls from NoDR and mild NPDR. However, neither BVD nor BFF was sensitive
enough to separate NoDR from the healthy controls. Conclusion: The NBFI has
been demonstrated as a sensitive biomarker of early DR, revealing retinal blood

Increasingly, robots build an internal representation of the world from sensor
readings. This representation can then be used to inform downstream tasks, such
as manipulation, collision avoidance, or human interaction. In practice, scene
representations vary widely depending on the type of robot, the sensing
modality, and the task that the robot is designed to do. This review provides
an overview of the scene representations used for robot manipulators (robot
arms). We focus primarily on representations which are built from real world
sensing and are used to inform some downstream robotics task.

  Mathematical Approach","31 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.optics cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider subaperture-based approaches for the digital
aberration correction (DAC) of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. In
particular, we introduce a mathematical framework for describing this class of
approaches, leading to new insights for the subaperture-correlation method.
Furthermore, we propose a novel DAC approach requiring only minimal statistical
assumptions on the spectral phase of the scanned object. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of our novel DAC approach via numerical examples
based on both simulated and experimental OCT data.

  Outage Probability",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  How are we able to fix it so as to theoretically go over it, if the
optimality and efficiency of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing
technique in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system fails in practice --
something that technically causes a considerable reduction in the maximum
achievable value of the transceiver's degree-of-freedom? Is the aforementioned
challenging issue theoretically interpretable?
  This paper considers the above mentioned challenge in the reconfigurable
intelligent surface based systems -- as an exemplified system model -- and
consequently proposes a Mendelain randomaisation (MR) technique through which
we can further overcome the aforementioned challenge. Towards such end and in
this paper, we take into account a Markov chain
$\mathcal{G}-\circ-\mathcal{X}-\circ-\mathcal{Y}-\circ-\mathcal{V}$ while
$\mathcal{G}$, $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ respectively
denote transmit design parameters, quality of goods, error floor in data
detection and non-orthogonality set in the OAM implementation -- arisen from
other non-optimalities, disturbances and inefficiencies such as the atmospheric
Kolmogorov turbulence. Furthermore, we consider a not-necessarily-Gaussian
randomisation method according to which the resultant probability distribution
function (PDF) is 2-D in relation to a definable outage probability in the
design problem in relation to $\mathcal{Y}$ -- that is, in terms of
$\beta_{\mathcal{X}}\theta$ while the randomisation is applied to $\theta$ as
the control input which should be optimally derived as the graph-theoretically
associating parameter between $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$, and
$\beta_{\mathcal{X}}$ is the the associating parameter between $\mathcal{G}$
and the exposure $\mathcal{X}$.

  Purposiveness, and Efficiency","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To improve communication efficiency and provide more useful information, we
need to measure semantic information by combining inaccuracy or distortion,
freshness, purposiveness, and efficiency. The author proposed the semantic
information G measure before. This measure is more compatible with Shannon
information theory than other semantic or generalized information measures and
has been applied to machine learning. This paper focuses on semantic predictive
information (including observation information) and purposive (or goal-related)
information (involving semantic communication and constraint control). The GPS
pointer is used as an example to discuss the change of semantic predictive
information with inaccuracy and time (age of the information). An example of
constraint control (controlling probability distributions) is provided for
measuring purposive information and maximizing this information and the
information efficiency. The information rate fidelity function (a
generalization of the information rate distortion function) is introduced for
the optimization. Two computing examples demonstrate how to measure predictive
and goal-related information and optimizing information efficiency. The results
accord with theoretical conclusions well. The G measure is related to deep
learning; its application to machine learning is worth exploring. Communication
efficiency also involves utilities or information values; semantic
communication optimization combining utilities needs further research.
