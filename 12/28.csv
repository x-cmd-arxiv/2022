that the primary beneficiaries of reproducibility efforts are, in fact, those
making the investments. I believe that (unashamedly) appealing to self

This dramatic system size sensitivity is known as the critical non-Hermitian

non-Hermitian pumping channels. In this work, we rigorously develop the notion
of a size-dependent generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) in a general

demonstrated their good empirical fit with two paradigmatic models, the coupled
Hatano-Nelson model with offset, and the topologically coupled chain model with
offset. We also provided analytic result for the critical size $L_c$, below
which cNHSE scaling is frozen. The cNHSE represents the result of juxtaposing
different channels for bulk-boundary correspondence breaking, and can be
readily demonstrated in non-Hermitian metamaterials and circuit arrays.

by the restriction of the configuration space of gauge fields from a wider
(parental) gauge theory. This formalism is based on application of
Batalin-Vilkovisky technique for quantization of theories with linearly
dependent generators, their linear dependence originating from a special type
of projection from the originally irreducible gauge generators of the parental
theory. The algebra of these projected generators is shown to be closed for
parental gauge algebras closed off shell. We demonstrate that new physics of
the restricted theory as compared to its parental theory is associated with the
rank deficiency of a special gauge restriction operator reflecting the gauge
transformation properties of the restriction constraints functions -- this
distinguishes restriction of the theory from its partial gauge fixing. As a
byproduct of this technique a workable algorithm for one-loop effective action
in generic first-stage reducible theory was constructed, along with the
explicit set of tree-level Ward identities for gauge field, ghost and
ghosts-for-ghosts propagators, which guarantee on-shell gauge independence of
this effective action. The restricted theory formalism with reducible set of
projected gauge generators is applied to unimodular gravity theory by using
background-covariant gauge-fixing procedure. Its one-loop effective action is
obtained in terms of functional determinants of minimal second order
differential operators calculable on generic backgrounds by Schwinger-DeWitt
technique of local curvature expansion. The result is shown to be equivalent to
Einstein gravity theory with a cosmological term up to a special contribution
of the global degree of freedom associated with the variable value of the

services for mobile devices and applications. Federated Learning (FL), which is
a promising approach to implement machine learning while addressing data
privacy concerns, typically involves a large number of wireless mobile devices
to collect model training data. Under such circumstances, FL is expected to
meet stringent training latency requirements in the face of limited resources
such as demand for wireless bandwidth, power consumption, and computation
constraints of participating devices. Due to practical considerations, FL
selects a portion of devices to participate in the model training process at
each iteration. Therefore, the tasks of efficient resource management and
device selection will have a significant impact on the practical uses of FL. In
this paper, we propose a spectrum allocation optimization mechanism for
enhancing FL over a wireless mobile network. Specifically, the proposed
spectrum allocation optimization mechanism minimizes the time delay of FL while
considering the energy consumption of individual participating devices; thus
ensuring that all the participating devices have sufficient resources to train
their local models. In this connection, to ensure fast convergence of FL, a
robust device selection is also proposed to help FL reach convergence swiftly,
especially when the local datasets of the devices are not independent and
identically distributed (non-iid). Experimental results show that (1) the
proposed spectrum allocation optimization method optimizes time delay while
satisfying the individual energy constraints; (2) the proposed device selection
method enables FL to achieve the fastest convergence on non-iid datasets.

algorithms using first-order oracles to find an approximate optimal solution.
We show that any first-order algorithm requires at least
${\Omega}\left(\frac{L}{\mu}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ gradient costs to
find an $\varepsilon$-approximate optimal solution for a general $L$-smooth
function that has an $\mu$-PL constant. This result demonstrates the optimality
of the Gradient Descent algorithm to minimize smooth PL functions in the sense
that there exists a ``hard'' PL function such that no first-order algorithm can
be faster than Gradient Descent when ignoring a numerical constant. In
contrast, it is well-known that the momentum technique, e.g. [Nesterov, 2003,
chap. 2] can provably accelerate Gradient Descent to
${O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\hat{\mu}}}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ gradient
costs for functions that are $L$-smooth and $\hat{\mu}$-strongly convex.
Therefore, our result distinguishes the hardness of minimizing a smooth PL

index theorems derived from Alain Connes' quantized calculus, are now well
understood in the independent electron picture. Here, we review recent
developments addressing the dynamics of correlated many-fermions systems,
obtained in collaboration with Bram Mesland. They supply a complete
characterization of an algebra of relevant derivations over the
$C^\ast$-algebra of canonical anti-commutation relations indexed by a generic
discrete Delone lattice. It is argued here that these results already supply
the means to generate interesting and relevant states over this algebra of
derivations and to identify the cyclic cocycles corresponding to the transport
coefficients of the many-fermion systems. The existing index theorems for the
pairings of these cocycles, in the restrictive single fermion setting, are
reviewed and updated with an emphasis on pushing the analysis on Sobolev

industrial domains that monitor metrics in order to prevent potential accidents

definitions of anomalies can complicate these efforts. Recent unsupervised
machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in tackling this problem
using either single-timestamp predictions or time series reconstructions. While
traditionally considered separately, these methods are not mutually exclusive
and can offer complementary perspectives on anomaly detection. This paper first
highlights the successes and limitations of prediction-based and
reconstruction-based methods with visualized time series signals and anomaly
scores. We then propose AER (Auto-encoder with Regression), a joint model that
combines a vanilla auto-encoder and an LSTM regressor to incorporate the
successes and address the limitations of each method. Our model can produce
bi-directional predictions while simultaneously reconstructing the original
time series by optimizing a joint objective function. Furthermore, we propose
several ways of combining the prediction and reconstruction errors through a
series of ablation studies. Finally, we compare the performance of the AER
architecture against two prediction-based methods and three
reconstruction-based methods on 12 well-known univariate time series datasets
from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, and UCR. The results show that AER has the highest
averaged F1 score across all datasets (a 23.5% improvement compared to ARIMA)
while retaining a runtime similar to its vanilla auto-encoder and regressor
components. Our model is available in Orion, an open-source benchmarking tool

of large-scale web-crawled data which provides rich knowledge about the visual
world for a captioning model. However, since web-crawled data contains
image-text pairs that are aligned at different levels, the inherent noises
(e.g., misaligned pairs) make it difficult to learn a precise captioning model.
While the filtering strategy can effectively remove noisy data, however, it
leads to a decrease in learnable knowledge and sometimes brings about a new
problem of data deficiency. To take the best of both worlds, we propose a
noise-aware learning framework, which learns rich knowledge from the whole
web-crawled data while being less affected by the noises. This is achieved by
the proposed quality controllable model, which is learned using alignment
levels of the image-text pairs as an additional control signal during training.
The alignment-conditioned training allows the model to generate high-quality
captions of well-aligned by simply setting the control signal to desired
alignment level at inference time. Through in-depth analysis, we show that our
controllable captioning model is effective in handling noise. In addition, with
two tasks of zero-shot captioning and text-to-image retrieval using generated

directions on large scales -- is fundamental to the standard cosmological
model. This model forms the building blocks of essentially all of our

which regimes its core assumptions hold. Anisotropies in the cosmic expansion
are expected on small scales due to nonlinear structures in the late Universe,
however, the extent to which these anisotropies might impact our low-redshift
observations remains to be fully tested. In this paper, we use fully general
relativistic simulations to calculate the expected local anisotropic expansion
and identify the dominant multipoles in cosmological parameters to be the
quadrupole in the Hubble parameter and the dipole in the deceleration
parameter. We constrain these multipoles simultaneously in the new Pantheon+
supernova compilation. The fiducial analysis is done in the rest frame of the
CMB with peculiar velocity corrections. Under the fiducial range of redshifts
in the Hubble flow sample, we find a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from isotropy. We
constrain the eigenvalues of the quadrupole in the Hubble parameter to be
$\lambda_1 =0.021\pm{ 0.011}$ and $ {\lambda_2= 3.15\times 10^{-5}}\pm 0.012$

without corrections, we find $ q_{ \rm dip} = 9.6^{+4.0}_{-6.9}$, a $>2\sigma$
positive amplitude. We also investigate the impact of these anisotropies on the
Hubble tension. We find a maximal shift of $0.30$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the
monopole of the Hubble parameter and conclude that local anisotropies are
unlikely to fully explain the observed tension.

and present false negative control (FNC) screening, a data-driven method to
efficiently regulate false negative proportion at a user-specified level. FNC
screening is developed in a realistic setting with arbitrary covariance
dependence between variables. We calibrate the overall dependence through a
parameter whose scale is compatible with the existing phase diagram in
high-dimensional sparse inference. Utilizing the new calibration, we
asymptotically explicate the joint effect of covariance dependence, signal
sparsity, and signal intensity on the proposed method. We interpret the results
using a new phase diagram, which shows that FNC screening can efficiently
select a set of candidate variables to retain a high proportion of signals even
when the signals are not individually separable from noise. Finite sample
performance of FNC screening is compared to those of several existing methods
in simulation studies. The proposed method outperforms the others in adapting
to a user-specified false negative control level. We implement FNC screening to
empower a two-stage GWAS procedure, which demonstrates substantial power gain
when working with limited sample sizes in real applications.

  re-entrainment in aging",,,,,"nlin.AO physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mammalian circadian system comprises a network of cell-autonomous
oscillators, spanning from the central clock in the brain to peripheral clocks
in other organs. These clocks are tightly coordinated to orchestrate rhythmic
physiological and behavioral functions. Dysregulation of these rhythms is a
hallmark of aging, yet it remains unclear how age-related changes lead to more
easily disrupted circadian rhythms. Using a two-population model of coupled
oscillators that integrates the central clock and the peripheral clocks, we
derive simple mean-field equations that can capture many aspects of the rich
behavior found in the mammalian circadian system. We focus on three
age-associated effects which have been posited to contribute to circadian
misalignment: attenuated input from the sympathetic pathway, reduced
responsiveness to light, and a decline in the expression of neurotransmitters.
We find that the first two factors can significantly impede re-entrainment of
the clocks following a perturbation, while a weaker coupling within the central
clock does not affect the recovery rate. Moreover, using our minimal model, we
demonstrate the potential of using the feed-fast cycle as an effective
intervention to accelerate circadian re-entrainment. These results highlight
the importance of peripheral clocks in regulating the circadian rhythm and
provide fresh insights into the complex interplay between aging and the
resilience of the circadian system.

estimation, it is common to augment the objective with a regularizer to address
challenges associated with ill-posedness. The choice of a suitable regularizer
is typically driven by prior domain information and computational
considerations. Convex regularizers are attractive as they are endowed with
certificates of optimality as well as the toolkit of convex analysis, but
exhibit a computational scaling that makes them ill-suited beyond
moderate-sized problem instances. On the other hand, nonconvex regularizers can
often be deployed at scale, but do not enjoy the certification properties
associated with convex regularizers. In this paper, we seek a systematic
understanding of the power and the limitations of convex regularization by
investigating the following questions: Given a distribution, what are the
optimal regularizers, both convex and nonconvex, for data drawn from the
distribution? What properties of a data source govern whether it is amenable to
convex regularization? We address these questions for the class of continuous
and positively homogenous regularizers for which convex and nonconvex
regularizers correspond, respectively, to convex bodies and star bodies. By
leveraging dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we show that a radial function derived
from a data distribution is the key quantity for identifying optimal
regularizers and for assessing the amenability of a data source to convex
regularization. Using tools such as $\Gamma$-convergence, we show that our
results are robust in the sense that the optimal regularizers for a sample
drawn from a distribution converge to their population counterparts as the
sample size grows large. Finally, we give generalization guarantees that
recover previous results for polyhedral regularizers (i.e., dictionary
learning) and lead to new ones for semidefinite regularizers.

share the spectrum with incumbent (primary) users and meet the growing demand
for bandwidth. One example is the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS) band, where the 5G and beyond communication systems need to sense the
spectrum and then access the channel in an opportunistic manner when the
incumbent user (e.g., radar) is not transmitting. To that end, a high-fidelity
classifier based on a deep neural network is needed for low misdetection (to
protect incumbent users) and low false alarm (to achieve high throughput for
NextG). In a dynamic wireless environment, the classifier can only be used for
a limited period of time, i.e., coherence time. A portion of this period is
used for learning to collect sensing results and train a classifier, and the
rest is used for transmissions. In spectrum sharing systems, there is a
well-known tradeoff between the sensing time and the transmission time. While
increasing the sensing time can increase the spectrum sensing accuracy, there
is less time left for data transmissions. In this paper, we present a
generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to generate synthetic sensing
results to augment the training data for the deep learning classifier so that
the sensing time can be reduced (and thus the transmission time can be
increased) while keeping high accuracy of the classifier. We consider both
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels, and show that this
GAN-based approach can significantly improve both the protection of the
high-priority user and the throughput of the NextG user (more in Rayleigh
channels than AWGN channels).

have shown that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which aim to mislead
the node or subgraph classification prediction by adding subtle perturbations.
Detecting these attacks is challenging due to the small magnitude of
perturbation and the discrete nature of graph data. In this paper, we propose a
general adversarial edge detection pipeline EDoG without requiring knowledge of
the attack strategies based on graph generation. Specifically, we propose a
novel graph generation approach combined with link prediction to detect
suspicious adversarial edges. To effectively train the graph generative model,
we sample several sub-graphs from the given graph data. We show that since the
number of adversarial edges is usually low in practice, with low probability
the sampled sub-graphs will contain adversarial edges based on the union bound.
In addition, considering the strong attacks which perturb a large number of
edges, we propose a set of novel features to perform outlier detection as the
preprocessing for our detection. Extensive experimental results on three
real-world graph datasets including a private transaction rule dataset from a
major company and two types of synthetic graphs with controlled properties show
that EDoG can achieve above 0.8 AUC against four state-of-the-art unseen attack
strategies without requiring any knowledge about the attack type; and around
0.85 with knowledge of the attack type. EDoG significantly outperforms
traditional malicious edge detection baselines. We also show that an adaptive
attack with full knowledge of our detection pipeline is difficult to bypass it.

WorldView, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at
such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the RGB, and
NIR bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve
excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly
preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel
approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training
data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more
is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a
precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained
model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide
range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and
2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.

processing applications. It can be very useful to have theoretical
characterizations that quantify the level of ill-posedness for a given inverse
problem and the degree of ambiguity that may exist about its solution.
Traditional measures of ill-posedness, such as the condition number of a
matrix, provide characterizations that are global in nature. While such
characterizations can be powerful, they can also fail to provide full insight
into situations where certain entries of the solution vector are more or less
ambiguous than others. In this work, we derive novel theoretical lower- and
upper-bounds that apply to individual entries of the solution vector, and are
valid for all potential solution vectors that are nearly data-consistent. These
bounds are agnostic to the noise statistics and the specific method used to
solve the inverse problem, and are also shown to be tight. In addition, our
results also lead us to introduce an entrywise version of the traditional
condition number, which provides a substantially more nuanced characterization
of scenarios where certain elements of the solution vector are less sensitive
to perturbations than others. Our results are illustrated in an application to
magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction, and we include discussions of
practical computation methods for large-scale inverse problems, connections
between our new theory and the traditional Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound under
statistical modeling assumptions, and potential extensions to cases involving
constraints beyond just data-consistency.

is probably one of the main contenders to become the network layer of the
future Internet thanks to its inbuilt support for mobility, in-network caching,

network applications. At the same time, massive satellite constellations are
currently being deployed in low Earth orbits (LEO) to provide a backend for
network connectivity. It is expected that, very soon, these constellations will
function as proper networks thanks to inter-satellite communication links.
These new satellite networks will be able to benefit from their greenfield
status and the new network architectures. In this paper we analyze how to
deploy the network caches of an NDN-based LEO satellite network. In particular,
we show how we can jointly select the most appropriate caching nodes for each

alternative ways. Performance results show that the caching and forwarding
strategies proposed reduce path lengths up to a third with just a few caching
nodes while, simultaneously, helping to spread the load along the network.

some new models claim to be ever more appropriate for understanding Earth's
core dynamics. One measure of the success of such models is the ability to
replicate the expected balance between forces operating within the core;
Coriolis and Lorentz forces are predicted to be most important. The picture is
complicated for an incompressible flow by the existence of the pressure
gradient force which renders the gradient parts of all other forces dynamically
unimportant. This can confuse the situation, especially when the scale
dependence of forces are considered. In this work we investigate force balances
through the alternative approach of eliminating gradient parts of each force to
form `solenoidal force balances'. We perform a lengthscale dependent analysis
for several spherical simulations and find that removal of gradient parts
offers an alternative picture of the force balance compared to looking at
traditional forces alone. Solenoidal force balances provide some agreement with
the results of previous studies but also significant differences. They offer a
cleaner overall picture of the dynamics and introduce differences at smaller
scales. This has implications for geodynamo models purporting to have reached
Earth-like regimes: in order to achieve a meaningful comparison of forces, only
the solenoidal part of forces should be considered.

support vectors, and are hence considered ""normal"". In this article, we improve
the effectiveness to detect outliers in dirty training data with a leave-out
strategy: by temporarily omitting one candidate at a time, this point can be
judged using the remaining data only. We show that this is more effective at
scoring the outlierness of points than using the slack term of existing
SVM-based approaches. Identified outliers can then be removed from the data,
such that outliers hidden by other outliers can be identified, to reduce the
problem of masking. Naively, this approach would require training N individual
SVMs (and training $O(N^2)$ SVMs when iteratively removing the worst outliers
one at a time), which is prohibitively expensive. We will discuss that only
support vectors need to be considered in each step and that by reusing SVM
parameters and weights, this incremental retraining can be accelerated
substantially. By removing candidates in batches, we can further improve the
processing time, although it obviously remains more costly than training a

motility. While monotrichous or uniflagellar bacteria possess a single
flagellum at one pole of their body, peritrichous bacteria grow multiple
flagella over the body surface, which form a rotating helical bundle propelling
the bacteria forward. Although the adaptation of bacterial cellular features is
under strong evolutionary pressure, existing evidence suggests that
multiflagellarity confers no noticeable benefit to the swimming of peritrichous
bacteria in bulk fluids compared with uniflagellar bacteria. This puzzling
result poses a long-standing question: why does multiflagellarity emerge given
the high metabolic cost of flagellar synthesis? Contrary to the prevailing
wisdom that its benefit lies beyond the basic function of flagella in steady
swimming, here we show that multiflagellarity provides a significant selective
advantage to bacteria in terms of their swimming ability, allowing bacteria to
maintain a constant swimming speed over a wide range of body size. By
synergizing experiments of immense sample sizes with quantitative hydrodynamic
modeling and simulations, we reveal how bacteria utilize the increasing number
of flagella to regulate the flagellar motor load, which leads to faster
flagellar rotation neutralizing the higher fluid drag on their larger bodies.
Without such a precise balancing mechanism, the swimming speed of uniflagellar
bacteria generically decreases with increasing body size. Our study sheds light
on the origin of multiflagellarity, a ubiquitous cellular feature of bacteria.
The uncovered difference between uniflagellar and multiflagellar swimming is
important for understanding environmental influence on bacterial morphology and
useful for designing artificial flagellated microswimmers.

charged-current vertices of a single second-order Feynman diagram for the
underlying process, enclosing neutrino propagation between these two points.
The key point of our approach is the definition of the space-time setup typical
for neutrino oscillation experiments, implying macroscopically large but finite
volumes of the source and detector separated by a sufficiently large distance
$L$. We derive an $L$-dependent master formula for the charged lepton
production rate, which provides the QFT basis for the analysis of neutrino
oscillations. Our formula depends on the underlying process and is not
reducible to the conventional approach resorting to the concept of neutrino
oscillation probability, which originates from non-relativistic quantum

Mazur pattern is a natural candidate for a satellite operator which acts by the
identity up to topological but not smooth concordance. Recently there has been
a resurgence of study of the action of the Mazur pattern up to concordance in
the smooth and topological categories. Examples showing that the Mazur pattern
does not act by the identity up to smooth concordance have been given by
Cochran-Franklin-Hedden-Horn and Collins. In this paper, we give evidence that
the Mazur pattern acts by the identity up to topological concordance.
  In particular, we show that two satellite operators $P_{K_0,\eta_0}$ and
$P_{K_1,\eta_1}$ with $\eta_0$ and $\eta_1$ freely homotopic have the same
action on the topological concordance group modulo the subgroup of
$(1)$-solvable knots, which gives evidence that they act in the same way up to
topological concordance. In particular, the Mazur pattern and the identity
operator are related in this way, and so this is evidence for the topological
side of the analogy to the Whitehead doubling operator. We give additional
evidence that they have the same action on the full topological concordance
group by showing that up to topological concordance they cannot be

introduce the odds ratio equi-confounding (OREC) assumption, which states that
the generalized odds ratios relating the treatment-free potential outcome and

establish nonparametric identification for any potential treatment effect on

coupled systems (physically open systems) to grasp the stability issues of
complex networks in areas such as biochemistry, neurons or economy, for which
their modelling in terms of non-hermitian Hamiltonians is still in infancy.
Specifically, we measure the connectivity between the two sets with the
parameter $\alpha$, which is the ratio of current adjacent pairs over the total
number of possible adjacent pairs between the sets. For general
undirected-graph setups, the non-hermitian Hamiltonian $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ of
this model presents pseudo-Hermiticity, where $\gamma$ is the loss/gain
strength. However, we show that for a given graph setup $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$
becomes ${\cal PT}-$symmetric. In both scenarios (pseudo-Hermiticity and ${\cal
PT}-$symmetric), depending on the parameter combination, the spectra of
$H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ can be real even when it is non-hermitian. Thus, we
numerically characterize the average fractions of real and imaginary
eigenvalues of $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ as a function of the parameter set
$\{\gamma,\alpha,N\}$. We demonstrate, for both setups, that there is a well
defined sector of the $\gamma\alpha-$plane (which grows with $N$) where the

simple predictive analytics. However, there is little systematic understanding

analysis. To address this gap, we conduct a study with 22 business users to
better understand their workflows and elicit feedback on the effectiveness of
four example PPA functionalities in business data analysis. We find that
business users can't depend on data analysts for their data analysis due to
four reasons: the limited availability of data analysts in enterprises, the
inefficiency of communicating with data analysts, the business pressure to make
quick decisions, and the importance of incorporating domain knowledge, which
data analysts often lack. We also find that business users rely on interactive
manual analysis using spreadsheet-like applications, which makes coping with
large, live, and complex datasets difficult. While business users don't use PPA
directly, their data analysis needs suggest that they can benefit from it. We
also find that PPA functionalities can increase business users' decision-making

Noether's theorems and their underlying framework, the covariant phase space

shown to projectively represent the asymptotic symmetry algebra. Issues arising
in the gravitational case, such as conservation, finiteness, and integrability,
are addressed. In the second part, we introduce the geometric concept of
corners, and show the existence of a universal asymptotic symmetry group at
corners. A careful treatment of corner embeddings provides a resolution to the
issue of integrability, by extending the phase space. In the last part we
bridge asymptotic symmetries and corners by formulating the corner proposal. In
essence, the latter focuses on the central question of extracting from
classical gravity universal results that are expected to hold in the quantum
realm. After reviewing the coadjoint orbit method and Atiyah Lie algebroids, we
apply these concepts to the corner proposal. Exercises are solved in the notes,

all the required configurations are made, Spark can also provide quality
attributes, such as scalability, fault tolerance, and security. However, all of

Two sets of experiments were performed: batch processing of unstructured data

significant size, ranging from 64 GB to 8192 GB in volume. The results show
that the performance of Unicage scripts is superior to Spark for search

guarantee excellent reliability performance, pragmatic precoder design is an
effective and indispensable solution. However, the design requires accurate
instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (ICSIT) which is not
always available in practice. Motivated by this, we adopt a deep learning (DL)
approach to exploit implicit features from estimated historical delay-Doppler
domain channels (DDCs) to directly predict the precoder to be adopted in the
next time frame for minimizing the frame error rate (FER), that can further
improve the system reliability without the acquisition of ICSIT. To this end,
we first establish a predictive transmission protocol and formulate a general
problem for the precoder design where a closed-form theoretical FER expression
is derived serving as the objective function to characterize the system
reliability. Then, we propose a DL-based predictive precoder design framework
which exploits an unsupervised learning mechanism to improve the practicability
of the proposed scheme. As a realization of the proposed framework, we design a
DDCs-aware convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) network for the
precoder design, where both the convolutional neural network and LSTM modules
are adopted to facilitate the spatial-temporal feature extraction from the
estimated historical DDCs to further enhance the precoder performance.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme facilitates a flexible
reliability-latency tradeoff and achieves an excellent FER performance that
approaches the lower bound obtained by a genie-aided benchmark requiring
perfect ICSI at both the transmitter and receiver.

collected a real SPAD image dataset (64 $\times$ 32 pixels, 90 scenes, 10
different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2790 images in total) to
calibrate noise model parameters. With this real-world physical noise model, we
for the first time synthesized a large-scale realistic single-photon image
dataset (image pairs of 5 different resolutions with maximum megapixels, 17250
scenes, 10 different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2.6 million
images in total) for subsequent network training. To tackle the severe
super-resolution challenge of SPAD inputs with low bit depth, low resolution,
and heavy noise, we further built a deep transformer network with a
content-adaptive self-attention mechanism and gated fusion modules, which can
dig global contextual features to remove multi-source noise and extract
full-frequency details. We applied the technique on a series of experiments
including macroscopic and microscopic imaging, microfluidic inspection, and
Fourier ptychography. The experiments validate the technique's state-of-the-art
super-resolution SPAD imaging performance, with more than 5 dB superiority on
PSNR compared to the existing methods.

planning of infrastructure investments and operations serving multiple end-uses

Electricity and natural gas (NG), which are vital vectors of today's energy

from increasing electrification, adoption of variable renewable energy (VRE)
generation in the power sector and policy factors such as cross-sectoral
emissions trading. This paper develops a least-cost investment and operations
model for joint planning of electricity and NG infrastructures that considers a
wide range of available and emerging technology options across the two vectors,
including carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipped power generation,
low-carbon drop-in fuels (LCDF) as well as long-duration energy storage (LDES).
The model incorporates the main operational constraints of both systems and
allows each system to operate under different temporal resolutions consistent
with their typical scheduling timescales. We apply the modeling framework to
evaluate power-NG system outcomes for the U.S. New England region under
different technology, decarbonization goals, and demand scenarios. Under a
global emissions constraint, ranging between 80-95\% emissions reduction
compared to 1990 levels, the least-cost solution disproportionately relies on
using the available emissions budget to serve non-power NG demand and results
in the power sector using only 15-43\% of the emissions budget.

circuits (V.K. Semenov et al., IEEE TAS, vol. 32, no. 4, 1400105, 2022) where
information is stored as a value of current in a superconducting loop and
transferred as a rate of SFQ pulses propagating between the loops. This
approach, in the simplest case dealing with positive numbers, requires
single-line transfer channels. In the more general case of bipolar numbers, it
requires dual-rail transfer channels. To address this need, we have developed a
new comparator with a dual-rail output. This comparator is an essential part of
a bipolar multiplier that has been designed, fabricated, and tested. We discuss
bioSFQ circuits for implementing an analog bipolar divide operation $Y/X$ and a
square root operation $X^{1/2}$. We discuss strategic advantages of the
suggested bioSFQ approach, e.g., an inherently asynchronous character of bioSFQ
cells which do not require explicit clock signals. As a result, bioSFQ circuits
are free of racing errors and tolerant to occasional collision of propagating
SFQ pulses. This tolerance is due to stochastic nature of data signals
generated by comparators operating within their gray zone. The circuits were
fabricated in the eight-niobium-layer fabrication process SFQ5ee developed for
superconductor electronics at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

solution changes in four stages, as revealed by the asymptotic analysis. When
the aspect ratio of the roll cell is about unity, the solution captures
quantitatively the characteristics of the classical turbulence regime.
Theoretically, the Nusselt number of the solution is proportional to the

shortening the axial period can reach the experimental value around the onset
of the ultimate turbulence regime, although at higher Taylor numbers the
theoretical predictions eventually underestimate the experimental values. An

model does not describe polymer motion in melts. Simulations find that the
temporal autocorrelation function of a single Rouse amplitude is a stretched
exponential in time, not the pure exponential predicted by the Rouse model.
Also, the mean-square amplitude of the Rouse modes <(X_p (0) X_p (0) > deviates
from the model's prediction, at least for p > 3. Furthermore, the relaxation
time of <(X_p (0) X_p (t) > depends on p, but not as predicted by the Rouse
model. According to the Rouse model, bead displacements are driven by
independent Gaussian random processes. Accordingly, the intermediate structure
factor g(q,t) is predicted to be accurately described by the Gaussian
approximation. Doob's theorem then guarantees that g(q,t) decays as a single
exponential in time. Simulations show that these predictions of the Rouse model
are incorrect.

small, heavy, monodisperse particles subject to collision-coagulation in
turbulent flow (i.e., colliding particles always coagulate (coalesce) into
large ones). We find that collision-coagulation causes the radial distribution
function (RDF) of the particles to decrease strongly at particle separation
distances $r$ close to the particle diameter $d$. However, the RDF do not
decrease indefinitely but approach a finite value in the limit of $r\to d$. We
study how the characteristics of this ""depletion zone"" relate to the particle
Stokes number (St), particle diameter, and the Reynolds number of the turbulent
flow. A collision-induced modulation factor $\gamma_{c}$ is defined to
represent the degree of RDF depletion due to collisions-coagulation. In the
region where $\gamma_c(r)$ is a quasi-power-law, the corresponding power-law
exponent $\tilde{c}_1$ only depends weakly on $St$. The overall trend of
$\tilde{c}_1$ with respect to $St$ is similar to that of the classical
power-law exponent $c_{1}$ appearing in the RDF of non-colliding particles,
i.e., the exponent increase at small $St$, peak around $St \approx 0.7$, and
decrease thereafter. The same qualitative trend is also observed for the
limiting values of $\gamma_c$ at $r\to d$. A complementary investigation on the
Stokes number trend of the full RDF in the depletion zone is conducted. The
slope of RDF appears constant for $St\ll1$ but is changing when $St$ is getting
large. The position where the RDF starts to decrease is found to be
$St$-dependent. The depletion zone is insensitive to the flow Reynolds number
and $\gamma_c$ of different $Re_{\lambda}$ overlap. With changing particle
diameter $d$, the reduction of RDF occurs at scales that shift accordingly and
always starts at around $2.4d-3d$. The shape of $\gamma_c(r)$ is independent of
changes in $d$.

Belady no longer ensures an optimal byte miss ratio (BMR), creating confusion
about how to achieve a superior BMR in CDNs. To address this issue, we
experimentally observe that there exists a time window to delay the eviction of

OMR. As a result, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (RL) model to
capture this time window by dynamically monitoring the changes in OMR and BMR,
and implementing a BMR-friendly policy in the time window. Based on this
policy, we propose a Belady and Size Eviction (LRU-BaSE) algorithm, reducing
BMR while maintaining OMR. To make LRU-BaSE efficient and practical, we address
the feedback delay problem of RL with a two-pronged approach. On the one hand,
our observation of a rear section of the LRU cache queue containing most of the
eviction candidates allows LRU-BaSE to shorten the decision region. On the
other hand, the request distribution on CDNs makes it feasible to divide the
learning region into multiple sub-regions that are each learned with reduced
time and increased accuracy. In real CDN systems, compared to LRU, LRU-BaSE can
reduce ""backing to OS"" traffic and access latency by 30.05\% and 17.07\%,

  Federated Learning","23 pages",,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) has received increasing attention due to its privacy
protection capability. However, the base algorithm FedAvg is vulnerable when it
suffers from so-called backdoor attacks. Former researchers proposed several
robust aggregation methods. Unfortunately, many of these aggregation methods
are unable to defend against backdoor attacks. What's more, the attackers
recently have proposed some hiding methods that further improve backdoor
attacks' stealthiness, making all the existing robust aggregation methods fail.
  To tackle the threat of backdoor attacks, we propose a new aggregation
method, X-raying Models with A Matrix (XMAM), to reveal the malicious local
model updates submitted by the backdoor attackers. Since we observe that the
output of the Softmax layer exhibits distinguishable patterns between malicious
and benign updates, we focus on the Softmax layer's output in which the
backdoor attackers are difficult to hide their malicious behavior.
Specifically, like X-ray examinations, we investigate the local model updates
by using a matrix as an input to get their Softmax layer's outputs. Then, we
preclude updates whose outputs are abnormal by clustering. Without any training
dataset in the server, the extensive evaluations show that our XMAM can
effectively distinguish malicious local model updates from benign ones. For
instance, when other methods fail to defend against the backdoor attacks at no
more than 20% malicious clients, our method can tolerate 45% malicious clients
in the black-box mode and about 30% in Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) mode.
Besides, under adaptive attacks, the results demonstrate that XMAM can still
complete the global model training task even when there are 40% malicious
clients. Finally, we analyze our method's screening complexity, and the results
show that XMAM is about 10-10000 times faster than the existing methods.

the discriminative regions which are highly-corresponded to the gradient

provided that the rate of quasiparticle relaxation is slow as compared to
dynamics of superconducting fluctuations. In this regime, fluctuations of
conductivity adiabatically follow the fluctuations of the electron
distribution. This leads to a substantial enhancement of current noise. The
corresponding spectral power density of noise has a Lorentzian shape in the
frequency domain while its magnitude scales proportionally to the inelastic
relaxation time. It also sensitively depends on the dephasing and

BMEC contains 5,666 images of individual erythroid cells, each of which is
extracted from the bone marrow erythroid cell smears and professionally
annotated to one of the four types of erythroid cells. To distinguish the
erythroid cells, one key indicator is the cell shape which is closely related
to the cell growth and maturation. Therefore, we design a novel shape-aware
image classification network for fine-grained erythroid cell classification.
The shape feature is extracted from the shape mask image and aggregated to the
raw image feature with a shape attention module. With the shape-attended image
feature, our network achieved superior classification performance (81.12\%
top-1 accuracy) on the BMEC dataset comparing to the baseline methods. Ablation
studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the shape
information for the fine-grained cell classification. To further verify the
generalizability of our method, we tested our network on two additional public
white blood cells (WBC) datasets and the results show our shape-aware method
can generally outperform recent state-of-the-art works on classifying the WBC.

have sparked interest in efficient deep learning mechanisms, e.g., quantization

version of commercial-scale models with comparable accuracy, accelerating their
deployment to resource-constrained devices.
  In this paper, we study the security considerations of publishing on-device
variants of large-scale models. We first show that an adversary can exploit
on-device models to make attacking the large models easier. In evaluations
across 19 DNNs, by exploiting the published on-device models as a transfer
prior, the adversarial vulnerability of the original commercial-scale models
increases by up to 100x. We then show that the vulnerability increases as the
similarity between a full-scale and its efficient model increase. Based on the
insights, we propose a defense, $similarity$-$unpairing$, that fine-tunes
on-device models with the objective of reducing the similarity. We evaluated
our defense on all the 19 DNNs and found that it reduces the transferability up
to 90% and the number of queries required by a factor of 10-100x. Our results
suggest that further research is needed on the security (or even privacy)

sequence labeling tasks and sequence data. However, their effectiveness is
limited when the observations in the sequence are irregularly sampled, where
the observations arrive at irregular time intervals. To address this,
continuous time variants of the RNNs were introduced based on neural ordinary
differential equations (NODE). They learn a better representation of the data
using the continuous transformation of hidden states over time, taking into
account the time interval between the observations. However, they are still
limited in their capability as they use the discrete transformations and a
fixed discrete number of layers (depth) over an input in the sequence to
produce the output observation. We intend to address this limitation by
proposing RNNs based on differential equations which model continuous
transformations over both depth and time to predict an output for a given input
in the sequence. Specifically, we propose continuous depth recurrent neural
differential equations (CDR-NDE) which generalizes RNN models by continuously
evolving the hidden states in both the temporal and depth dimensions. CDR-NDE
considers two separate differential equations over each of these dimensions and
models the evolution in the temporal and depth directions alternatively. We
also propose the CDR-NDE-heat model based on partial differential equations

components (TPCs) to improve development efficiency. Nevertheless, TPCs are not
secure, and the vulnerabilities in TPCs will influence the security of IoT
firmware. Existing works pay less attention to the vulnerabilities caused by
TPCs, and we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the security impact of
TPC vulnerability against firmware. To fill in the knowledge gap, we design and
implement FirmSec, which leverages syntactical features and control-flow graph
features to detect the TPCs in firmware, and then recognizes the corresponding
vulnerabilities. Based on FirmSec, we present the first large-scale analysis of
the security risks raised by TPCs on $34,136$ firmware images. We successfully
detect 584 TPCs and identify 128,757 vulnerabilities caused by 429 CVEs. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the diversity of security risks in firmware and
discovers some well-known vulnerabilities are still rooted in firmware.
Besides, we explore the geographical distribution of vulnerable devices and
confirm that the security situation of devices in different regions varies. Our
analysis also indicates that vulnerabilities caused by TPCs in firmware keep
growing with the boom of the IoT ecosystem. Further analysis shows 2,478
commercial firmware images have potentially violated GPL/AGPL licensing terms.

between an even-parity superconductivity and an odd-parity superconductivity in
$\mathrm{CeRh_{2}As_{2}}$, the microscopic physics is still under
investigation. However, if, in the vicinity of this transition, the coupling
strengths of the even and odd pairing channels are comparable, a
particle-particle excitonic collective mode referred to as the
Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode should generically exist below the pair-breaking
continuum. This BS mode can couple to the light and thus affect the optical
response of the superconductor, as it arises from a pairing channel with the
parity opposite to that of the ground state pairs. Here, by using a generic
bilayer model Hamiltonian for the electronic degree of freedom, which is
globally centrosymmetric despite each layer being locally non-centrosymmetric,
we study the change of the excitation gap of the BS mode with respect to the
out-of-plane magnetic fields and demonstrate that its coupling to the light is
possible even in the linear response regime. The linear coupling is attributed
to the presence of multiple electronic bands, which is a generic feature of a
bilayer system. Our result shows the microwave absorption as the signature of
the BS mode, and hence a smoking gun signature of the parity-switching at the
transition between two superconducting phases.

However, the community faces two challenges: i) how to learn robust
representations from a large amount of unlabeled data to against noise or
incomplete views setting, and ii) how to balance view consistency and
complementary for various downstream tasks. To this end, we utilize a deep
fusion network to fuse view-specific representations into the view-common
representation, extracting high-level semantics for obtaining robust
representation. In addition, we employ a clustering task to guide the fusion
network to prevent it from leading to trivial solutions. For balancing
consistency and complementary, then, we design an asymmetrical contrastive
strategy that aligns the view-common representation and each view-specific
representation. These modules are incorporated into a unified method known as
CLustering-guided cOntrastiVE fusioN (CLOVEN). We quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluate the proposed method on five datasets, demonstrating that
CLOVEN outperforms 11 competitive multi-view learning methods in clustering and
classification. In the incomplete view scenario, our proposed method resists
noise interference better than those of our competitors. Furthermore, the

conditions, the single occupation of a slave particle per site, in the slave

$\lambda_i(t)$ was taken into account to ensure the constraints. This
introduces time-dependent redundant gauge degrees of freedom because original
Lagrange multiplier $\lambda_i$ is static and never becomes time-dependent.
Therefore, an additional (gauge fixing) constraint $\partial_t \lambda_i(t)=0$
which was missed before has to be enforced. This constraint endows
$\lambda_i(t)$ with a dynamics. With this, the slave particle theory dualizes
strongly correlated problems to well-controlled weak coupling problems. The
mean field (MF) approximations are controllable and can be examined if the MF
phases are stable against the $\lambda_i$ fluctuation, e.g., the
superconducting (SC) state of Hubbard model at half-filling is not stable.
While the MF SC state of the $t$-$J$ model is stable, the pairing gap may be
substantially suppressed by the fluctuation. This may explain the SC $T_c$ of

corresponding to the primary radio flare in late 2009 and the secondary radio
flare in early 2010. The primary 2009 flare was found to be associated with the
ejection of J2. The secondary 2010 flare occurred at a distance of $\sim$0.3
parsec from the central engine, probably resulting from the collision of the
jet with the accretion disk wind. The variability characteristics of III Zw 2
(periodic radio flares, unstable periodicity, multiple quasi-periodic signals
and possible harmonic relations between them) can be explained by the global
instabilities of the accretion disk. These instabilities originating from the
outer part of the warped disk propagate inwards and can lead to modulation of
the accretion rate and consequent jet ejection. At the same time, the wobbling

Particularly, we derive an elegant identity that equates the linking number

paragraph of description where the sentences describe different segments of the
video, by matching all sentence-clip pairs, the paragraph and the full video
are aligned implicitly. However, such unit-level comparison may ignore global
temporal context, which inevitably limits the generalization ability. In this
paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework TempCLR to compare the full
video and the paragraph explicitly. As the video/paragraph is formulated as a
sequence of clips/sentences, under the constraint of their temporal order, we
use dynamic time warping to compute the minimum cumulative cost over
sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To explore the temporal
dynamics, we break the consistency of temporal succession by shuffling video
clips w.r.t. temporal granularity. Then, we obtain the representations for
clips/sentences, which perceive the temporal information and thus facilitate
the sequence alignment. In addition to pre-training on the video and paragraph,
our approach can also generalize on the matching between video instances. We
evaluate our approach on video retrieval, action step localization, and
few-shot action recognition, and achieve consistent performance gain over all
three tasks. Detailed ablation studies are provided to justify the approach

replacing the role of variational principles such as the Dirichlet and Thomson
principles with an $H^1$-approximation of the equilibrium potential, we develop
a new method that can be applied to non-reversible dynamics as well in a simple
manner. As an application of this method, we analyze metastable behavior of not

that will be in the focus of this paper are: possible source of UHECRs and the
acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays beyond PeV energies. Small pitch-angle
scattering of UHECRs and possible confinement has been investigated using
quasilinear theory in order to analytically calculate pitch-angle Fokker-Planck

waves. We show that the resonance function is broadened due to damping effects
and this result is compared with the nonlinear broadening. Unlike the case of
purely parallel (or antiparallel) propagating waves in slab turbulence, the
presence of the compressive magnetic field component of oblique fast-mode waves
allows the cosmic ray particles to resonantly interact with these waves through
the n = 0 resonance, together with gyroresonance, which strongly influence the
Hillas limit. The derived results can be used to compute the parallel mean free
path for all forms of the turbulence spectrum; it has been applied on the
transport and propagation of CRs close to ultra-high energies in the Galaxy. An
accurate understanding of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources could

manipulation in active matter remains an challenging area of research. In this
study, we investigated the geometric control of defect positioning and
alignment in a nematic cell population by imposing spatial constraints
consisting of two or three overlapping circular boundaries. The confined cell
population exhibited an ordered pairing of half-integer topological defects
that remained stable even when the size of the spatial constraint was altered
using geometric parameters. These defects also elicited robust contractile flow
that induced a negative divergence in the velocity field of collective motion.
Such net contractile flow can contribute to mechanical stimulation on confined

obtained using a newly proposed type of initial condition which represents the
initial state of a given nucleus and the solutions based on an initial
condition representing a proton coupled to a Glauber-Gribov prescription. The
influence from the different energy evolutions of these two approaches are
studied in the following photo-nuclear processes: inclusive and diffractive
DIS, coherent production of a J/psi meson in ultra-peripheral collisions, and
the deeply virtual Compton scattering. By comparison to the available data from

third-order exponential integrator, where the main idea lies in embedding the
oscillations triggered by the possibly highly oscillatory component
intrinsically into the numerical discretisation. While typically high
oscillation requires appropriately small time steps, an application of Filon
methods allows implementation with large time steps even in the presence of
very high oscillation. This greatly improves the efficiency of the
time-stepping algorithm.
  Proof of the convergence and its rate are nontrivial and require alternative
representation of the equation under consideration. We derive careful bounds on
the growth of global error in time discretisation and prove that, contrary to
standard intuition, the error of time integration does not grow once the
frequency of oscillations increases. Several of numerical simulations are
presented to confirm the theoretical investigations and the robustness of the
method in all oscillatory regimes.

nonlinear spectrum of these skin breathers demonstrates a hierarchical
power-law scaling near the EP, i.e., the response of nonlinear energy to the
perturbation $E_m\propto \Gamma^{\alpha_{m}}$, where $\alpha_m=3^{m-1}$ is the
power with $m=1,\cdots,L$ labeling the nonlinear energy bands. This is in sharp
contrast to the $L$th root of a generally linear perturbation. These skin
breathers decay in a double-exponential way, not in the exponential way as the
edge states or skin modes in linear systems. Moreover, these skin breathers can
survive over the full nonlinearity strength, continuously connected to the
self-trapped states at the large limit, and they are also stable according to
the stability analysis, which are reflected by a defined nonlinear fidelity of
an adiabatic evolution.Since the nonreciprocal models are experimentally
realized in optical systems where the Kerr's nonlinearity naturally exits, our
results may stimulate more studies of interplay between nonlinearity and
non-Hermiticity, especially the linear EPs.

reduce the repair time by 34 minutes on average. Further, BAPP improves the

computational pathology. However, no existing method can generate realistic
tissue images with a bespoke cellular layout or user-defined histology
parameters. In this work, we propose a novel framework called SynCLay
(Synthesis from Cellular Layouts) that can construct realistic and high-quality
histology images from user-defined cellular layouts along with annotated
cellular boundaries. Tissue image generation based on bespoke cellular layouts
through the proposed framework allows users to generate different histological
patterns from arbitrary topological arrangement of different types of cells.
SynCLay generated synthetic images can be helpful in studying the role of
different types of cells present in the tumor microenvironmet. Additionally,
they can assist in balancing the distribution of cellular counts in tissue
images for designing accurate cellular composition predictors by minimizing the
effects of data imbalance. We train SynCLay in an adversarial manner and
integrate a nuclear segmentation and classification model in its training to
refine nuclear structures and generate nuclear masks in conjunction with
synthetic images. During inference, we combine the model with another
parametric model for generating colon images and associated cellular counts as
annotations given the grade of differentiation and cell densities of different
cells. We assess the generated images quantitatively and report on feedback
from trained pathologists who assigned realism scores to a set of images
generated by the framework. The average realism score across all pathologists
for synthetic images was as high as that for the real images. We also show that
augmenting limited real data with the synthetic data generated by our framework
can significantly boost prediction performance of the cellular composition
prediction task.

allows synchronizing the motion of a chain of several coupled nonlinear
oscillators actuated through one end of the chain. The chain considered in this
work is a one-dimensional array of pendulums pivoting around a single axis and
interacting with adjacent pendulums through torsion springs; the array is
actuated using a single torque motor attached to one of the two boundary
pendulums. This represents a mechanical realization of the Frenkel-Kontorova
model { a spatially discrete version of a sine-Gordon equation describing
(nonlinear) waves. The main challenges of controlling these systems are: high
order (the number of pendulums can be high), nonlinear dynamics, and (as we set
the problem here) only one actuator. The presented problem of synchronization
of motion is a special case of the problem of reference tracking, where all
pendulums reach a common point or a trajectory. In particular, we demonstrate
synchronization to a stable equilibrium (all pendulums downward), unstable
equilibrium (all pendulums upward), and a periodic orbit (all pendulums
revolving). We use the Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC) that constructs
a linear predictor of the nonlinear system in a higher-dimensional lifted space
and uses the predictor within a classical linear MPC, thereby maintaining low
computational cost that allows for a real-time implementation, while taking
into account the complex nonlinear dynamics.

rich phenomenology hallmarked by measurement-induced phase transitions.
Employing feedback-control operations that steer the dynamics toward an
absorbing state, we study the entanglement entropy behavior at the absorbing
state phase transition. For short-range control operations, we observe a
transition between phases with distinct sub-extensive scalings of entanglement
entropy. In contrast, the system undergoes a transition between volume-law and
area-law phases for long-range feedback operations. The fluctuations of
entanglement entropy and of the order parameter of the absorbing state
transition are fully coupled for sufficiently strongly entangling feedback
operations. In that case, entanglement entropy inherits the universal dynamics
of the absorbing state transition. This is, however, not the case for arbitrary
control operations, and the two transitions are generally distinct. We
quantitatively support our results by introducing a framework based on
stabilizer circuits with classical flag labels. Our results shed new light on
the problem of observability of measurement-induced phase transitions.

reconstruct a low mean squared error reconstruction that is close to the input,
a realistic reconstruction with high perceptual quality, or anything in

Following this observation, we also find that optimization methods designed to
escape from saddle points can be effectively used to improve generalization on

Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), a recent technique that encourages
convergence to a flat minima, can be effectively used to escape saddle points

information that describes how two objects are connected by meta-paths.
Further, they fail to distinguish negative samples, which could adversely
affect the model performance. To address the problems, we propose MEOW, which

MEOW constructs a coarse view and a fine-grained view for contrast. The former
reflects which objects are connected by meta-paths, while the latter uses

Then, we theoretically analyze the InfoNCE loss and recognize its limitations

prototypical contrastive learning to pull close embeddings of nodes in the same
cluster. In addition, we propose a variant model AdaMEOW that adaptively learns
soft-valued weights of negative samples to further improve node representation.

the channel state information (CSI) knowledge to predict the phase-shifts of
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), beamformers at the base station (BS),
and the transmit powers of BS and uplink users in order to maximize the
weighted sum rate of uplink and downlink users. As the self-interference (SI)
cancellation and beamformer design are coupled problems, the first stage uses a
least squares method to partially cancel self-interference (SI) and initiate
learning, while the second stage uses DRL to make predictions and achieve
performance close to methods with perfect CSI knowledge. Further, to reduce the
signaling from BS to the RISs, a DRL framework is proposed that predicts
quantized RIS phase-shifts and beamformers using $32$ times fewer bits than the
continuous version. The quantized methods have reduced action space and
therefore faster convergence; with sufficient training, the UL and DL rates for
the quantized phase method are $8.14\%$ and $2.45\%$ better than the continuous
phase method respectively. The RIS elements can be grouped to have similar
phase-shifts to further reduce signaling, at the cost of reduced performance.

stars are notorious for their high level of variability, stemming from
stochastic clumps in their strong winds that are slower and less hot than the
winds of most other Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. We confirm previous results that
many WR stars display an amplitude of variability that is an order-of-magnitude
higher in photometry than in polarimetry. For the first time, the unique nature
of near simultaneity of our photometric and polarimetric observations of WR40
allows us to check whether the two types of variability show correlated
behaviour, of which we find none. Assuming simple temporal functions for the
brightness and polarisation of individual clumps, a model for simulated light
curves is found to reproduce the properties of the observations, specifically
the absence of correlation between photometric and polarimetric variations, the
ratio of standard deviations for photometric and polarimetric variability, and
the ratio of the average intrinsic polarisation relative to its standard
deviation. Mapping the solution for time variability to a spatial coordinate
suggests that the wind clumps of WR40 are free-free emitting in addition to
light scattering.

the physical properties of polymers confined to small cavities. Two recent
studies using such methods examined the organization and dynamics of two DNA
molecules in box-like cavities with strong confinement in one direction and
with square and elliptical cross sections in the lateral plane. Motivated by
these experiments, we employ Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations to
study the physical behaviour of two polymers confined to small cavities with
shapes comparable to those used in the experiments. We quantify the effects of
varying the following polymer properties and confinement dimensions on the
organization and dynamics of the polymers: the polymer width, the polymer
contour length ratio, the cavity cross-sectional area, and the degree of cavity
elongation for cavities with rectangular and elliptical cross sections. We find
that the tendency for polymers to segregate is enhanced by increasing polymer
width. For sufficiently small cavities, increasing cavity elongation promotes
segregation and localization of identical polymers to opposite sides of the
cavity along its long axis. A free-energy barrier controls the rate of polymers
swapping positions, and the observed dynamics are roughly in accord with
predictions of a simple theoretical model. Increasing the contour length
difference between polymers significantly affects their organization in the
cavity. In the case of a large linear polymer co-trapped with a small ring
polymer in an elliptical cavity, the small polymer tends to lie near the
lateral confining walls, and especially at the cavity poles for highly
elongated ellipses.

by extracting pertinent textures from nearby frames with known degradation
processes. Despite significant progress, grand challenges are remained to
effectively extract and transmit high-quality textures from high-degraded
low-quality sequences, such as blur, additive noises, and compression
artifacts. In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for
handling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined
space-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and
each patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a
frequency band. It permits a fine-grained self-attention on each frequency
band, so that real visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts. Second,
a novel dual frequency attention (DFA) mechanism is proposed to capture the
global frequency relations and local frequency relations, which can handle
different complicated degradation processes in real-world scenarios. Third, we
explore different self-attention schemes for video processing in the frequency
domain and discover that a ``divided attention'' which conducts a joint
space-frequency attention before applying temporal-frequency attention, leads
to the best video enhancement quality. Extensive experiments on three
widely-used VSR datasets show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on different low-quality videos with clear visual margins. Code and pre-trained

on different structural states (conditions) of dissimilar civil structures. The
study herein introduces a novel framework named Structural State Translation
(SST), which aims to estimate the response data of different civil structures
based on the information obtained from a dissimilar structure. SST can be
defined as Translating a state of one civil structure to another state after
discovering and learning the domain-invariant representation in the source
domains of a dissimilar civil structure. SST employs a Domain-Generalized
Cycle-Generative (DGCG) model to learn the domain-invariant representation in
the acceleration datasets obtained from a numeric bridge structure that is in
two different structural conditions. In other words, the model is tested on
three dissimilar numeric bridge models to translate their structural
conditions. The evaluation results of SST via Mean Magnitude-Squared Coherence
(MMSC) and modal identifiers showed that the translated bridge states
(synthetic states) are significantly similar to the real ones. As such, the
minimum and maximum average MMSC values of real and translated bridge states

its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the performance of the adversarial
training is greatly limited by the architectures of target DNNs, which often
makes the resulting DNNs with poor accuracy and unsatisfactory robustness. To
address this problem, we propose DSARA to automatically search for the neural
architectures that are accurate and robust after adversarial training. In
particular, we design a novel cell-based search space specially for adversarial
training, which improves the accuracy and the robustness upper bound of the
searched architectures by carefully designing the placement of the cells and
the proportional relationship of the filter numbers. Then we propose a
two-stage search strategy to search for both accurate and robust neural
architectures. At the first stage, the architecture parameters are optimized to
minimize the adversarial loss, which makes full use of the effectiveness of the
adversarial training in enhancing the robustness. At the second stage, the
architecture parameters are optimized to minimize both the natural loss and the
adversarial loss utilizing the proposed multi-objective adversarial training
method, so that the searched neural architectures are both accurate and robust.
We evaluate the proposed algorithm under natural data and various adversarial
attacks, which reveals the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both
accurate and robust architectures. We also conclude that accurate and robust
neural architectures tend to deploy very different structures near the input
and the output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting

order to provide a better and optimised predictive model with reduced bias,
variance and improved predictions. However, in federated learning it is not
feasible to apply centralised ensemble learning directly due to privacy
concerns. Hence, a mechanism is required to combine results of local models to
produce a global model. Most distributed consensus algorithms, such as
Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), do not normally perform well in such
applications. This is because, in such methods predictions of some of the peers
are disregarded, so a majority of peers can win without even considering other
peers' decisions. Additionally, the confidence score of the result of each peer
is not normally taken into account, although it is an important feature to
consider for ensemble learning. Moreover, the problem of a tie event is often
left un-addressed by methods such as BFT. To fill these research gaps, we
propose PoSw (Proof of Swarm), a novel distributed consensus algorithm for
ensemble learning in a federated setting, which was inspired by particle swarm
based algorithms for solving optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm is
theoretically proved to always converge in a relatively small number of steps
and has mechanisms to resolve tie events while trying to achieve sub-optimum
solutions. We experimentally validated the performance of the proposed
algorithm using ECG classification as an example application in healthcare,
showing that the ensemble learning model outperformed all local models and even
the FL-based global model. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm
is the first attempt to make consensus over the output results of distributed
models trained using federated learning.

constraints on the input probability measures. The theory of Optimal
Uncertainty Quantification allows us to convert the task into a constraint
optimization problem where one seeks to compute the least upper/greatest lower

high-dimensional and non-convex by nature. Therefore, it is difficult to find
the optimal uncertainty bounds in practice. In this paper, we examine the use

We achieve this by introducing a neural network classifier to approximate the
performance indicator combined with the stochastic gradient descent method to
solve the optimization problem. We demonstrate the learning based framework on

smoke simulation, then increase the frame rate using temporal interpolation.
However, low frame rate smoke simulations are inaccurate as they require
increasing the time-step. A simulation with a larger time-step produces results
different from that of the original simulation with a small time-step.
Therefore, the proposed method corrects the large time-step simulation results
closer to the corresponding small time-step simulation results using a
U-Net-based DNN model. To obtain more precise results, we applied modeling
concepts used in the image domain, such as optical flow and perceptual loss. By
correcting the large time-step simulation results and interpolating between
them, the proposed method can efficiently and accurately generate high frame
rate smoke simulations. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our analyses show that our
method reduces the mean squared error of large time-step simulation results by
more than 80% on average. Our method also produces results closer to the ground
truth than the previous DNN-based methods; it is on average 2.04 times more

unacceptable behaviors such as hate speech, harassment, violence against
specific groups, terrorism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, or misogyny, to
mention some few, in Online Social Platforms. These platforms make use of a
plethora of tools to detect and manage malicious information; however,
malicious actors also improve their skills, developing strategies to surpass
these barriers and continuing to spread misleading information. Twisting and
camouflaging keywords are among the most used techniques to evade platform
content moderation systems. In response to this recent ongoing issue, this
paper presents an innovative approach to address this linguistic trend in
social networks through the simulation of different content evasion techniques
and a multilingual Transformer model for content evasion detection. In this
way, we share with the rest of the scientific community a multilingual public
tool, named ""pyleetspeak"" to generate/simulate in a customizable way the
phenomenon of content evasion through automatic word camouflage and a
multilingual Named-Entity Recognition (NER) Transformer-based model tuned for
its recognition and detection. The multilingual NER model is evaluated in
different textual scenarios, detecting different types and mixtures of
camouflage techniques, achieving an overall weighted F1 score of 0.8795. This
article contributes significantly to countering malicious information by
developing multilingual tools to simulate and detect new methods of evasion of
content on social networks, making the fight against information disorders more
effective.

scoliosis assessment, but current assessment method only uses coronal
projection image and cannot illustrate the 3D deformity and vertebra rotation.
The vertebra detection is essential to reveal 3D spine information, but the
detection task is challenging due to complex data and limited annotations. We
propose VertMatch, a two-step framework to detect vertebral structures in 3D
ultrasound volume by utilizing unlabeled data in semi-supervised manner. The
first step is to detect the possible positions of structures on transverse
slice globally, and then the local patches are cropped based on detected
positions. The second step is to distinguish whether the patches contain real
vertebral structures and screen the predicted positions from the first step.
VertMatch develops three novel components for semi-supervised learning: for
position detection in the first step, (1) anatomical prior is used to screen
pseudo labels generated from confidence threshold method; (2) multi-slice
consistency is used to utilize more unlabeled data by inputting multiple
adjacent slices; (3) for patch identification in the second step, the
categories are rebalanced in each batch to solve imbalance problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that VertMatch can detect vertebra accurately
in ultrasound volume and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. VertMatch is
also validated in clinical application on forty ultrasound scans, and it can be
a promising approach for 3D assessment of scoliosis.

  Conference for Undergraduate Research (SCCUR), preprint for publishing in
  research journal, currently in the peer-review process",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since supplanting Canada in 2014, Chinese investors have been the lead
foreign buyers of U.S. real estate, concentrating their purchases in urban
areas with higher Chinese populations like California. The reasons for
investment include prestige, freedom from capital confiscation, and safe,
diversified opportunities from abroad simply being more lucrative and available
than in their home country, where the market is eroding. Interestingly, since
2019, Chinese investors have sold a net 23.6 billion dollars of U.S. commercial
real estate, a stark contrast to past acquisitions between 2013 to 2018 where
they were net buyers of almost 52 billion dollars worth of properties. A
similar trend appears in the residential real estate segment too. In both 2017
and 2018, Chinese buyers purchased over 40,000 U.S. residential properties
which were halved in 2019 and steadily declined to only 6,700 in the past year.
This turnaround in Chinese investment can be attributed to a deteriorating
relationship between the U.S. and China during the Trump Presidency, financial
distress in China, and new Chinese government regulations prohibiting outbound
investments. Additionally, while Chinese investment is a small share of U.S.
real estate (~1.5% at its peak), it has outsized impacts on market valuations
of home prices in U.S. zip codes with higher populations of foreign-born
Chinese, increasing property prices and exacerbating the issue of housing
affordability in these areas. This paper investigates the rapid growth and
decline of Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and its effect on U.S. home
prices in certain demographics.

neurophysiological mechanisms and interactions between multiple memory systems.
The brain efficiently encodes information in non-overlapping sparse codes,
which facilitates the learning of new associations faster with controlled
interference with previous associations. To mimic sparse coding in DNNs, we
enforce activation sparsity along with a dropout mechanism which encourages the
model to activate similar units for semantically similar inputs and have less
overlap with activation patterns of semantically dissimilar inputs. This
provides us with an efficient mechanism for balancing the reusability and
interference of features, depending on the similarity of classes across tasks.
Furthermore, we employ sparse coding in a multiple-memory replay mechanism. Our
method maintains an additional long-term semantic memory that aggregates and
consolidates information encoded in the synaptic weights of the working model.
Our extensive evaluation and characteristics analysis show that equipped with
these biologically inspired mechanisms, the model can further mitigate
forgetting.

initial setup and goal configuration with extra points of intersection, and
then generate possible construction steps as intermediary data models that are
used as feedback in the training process for further refinement of the
construction step sequence. This process is repeated recursively until either a
solution is found, in which case we backtrack the path for a step-by-step
construction guide, or the problem is identified as unsolvable. Our EuclidNet
framework is validated on complex Japanese Sangaku geometry problems,
demonstrating its capacity to leverage backtracking for deep visual reasoning

hydrodynamic cavitation, which has been reported to introduce a non-equilibrium
state of para- and ortho- isomers of water. Differential measurements are
conducted with 0.3mm and 0.5mm capillary tubes and precision digital vernier
height gauges. Water samples are degassed at -0.09 MPa, their temperature is
equalized. Since the non-equilibrium state of isomers is expected to exist in
ice-like building blocks near the water interfaces, the immersion depth of
capillary tubes was set to 10mm, 2mm and about 0.1mm below the surface. The
measurement results show the difference in surface tension of 6.7%-11.3% with a
maximum value of about 15.7% between control and experimental samples. These
effects in near-surface layers are observed within 30-60 minutes after the
excitation. Experimental samples taken from the surface demonstrate movement
about 2 times longer than control ones; their values are largest in the whole
series of experiments. Micro-manipulation tool recorded an interesting effect
of stopping the liquid in capillary tubes, observed mostly in experimental
samples, where the meniscus and surface tension oscillated at 0.05-0.1mm level.
The described approach has two main applications. First, the measurement system
can be used as the fast and cost effective detector of spin-based phenomena
that affect viscosity and surface tension. Second, since the capillary effects
plays an important role in aquaporin channels and plant water transportation
system, these techniques can be applied in phytosensing, in particular, in sap
flow measurements, and in a hydroponic production.
