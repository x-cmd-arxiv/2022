boundaries of the Jovian magnetosphere (namely the magnetopause and bow shock).
From the boundary locations, the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure can be
inferred, which in turn illustrates the state of compression or relaxation of
the system. The aim of this study is to examine Jovian radio emissions during
magnetospheric compressions, in order to determine the relationship between the
solar wind and Jovian radio emissions. In this paper, we give a complete list
of bow shock and magnetopause crossings (from June 2016 to August 2022), along
with some extra informations (e.g. solar wind dynamic pressure and position of
the standoff distances inferred from Joy et al. (2002)). We then select two
compression events that occur in succession (inferred from magnetopause
crossings) and we present a case study of the response of the Jovian radio
emissions. We demonstrate that magnetospheric compressions lead to the
activation of new radio sources. Newly activated broadband kilometric emissions
are observed almost simultaneously to compression of the magnetosphere, with
sources covering a large range of longitudes. Decametric emission sources are
seen to be activated more than one rotation later only at specific longitudes
and dusk local times. Finally, the activation of narrowband kilometric
radiation is not observed during the compression phase, but when the
magnetosphere is in its expansion phase.

large program aimed at determining the elemental abundances of carbon (C),
oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) in a selected set of prototypical
star-forming filaments. In particular, the elemental abundance of S remains
uncertain by several orders of magnitude and its determination is one of the
most challenging goals of this program. We have carried out an extensive
chemical modeling of the fractional abundances of CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, CS,
SO, H$_2$S, OCS, and HCS$^+$ to determine the sulfur depletion toward the 244
positions in the GEMS database. These positions sample visual extinctions from
A$_V$ $\sim$ 3 mag to $>$50 mag, molecular hydrogen densities ranging from a
few 10$^3$~cm$^{-3}$ to 3$\times$10$^6$~cm$^{-3}$, and T$_k$ $\sim$ 10$-$35 K.
Most of the positions in Taurus and Perseus are best fitted assuming early-time
chemistry, t=0.1 Myr, $\zeta_{H_2}$$\sim$ (0.5$-$1)$\times$10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$,
and [S/H]$\sim$1.5$\times$10$^{-6}$. On the contrary, most of the positions in
Orion are fitted with t=1~Myr and $\zeta_{H_2}$$\sim$ 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.
Moreover, $\sim$40% of the positions in Orion are best fitted assuming the
undepleted sulfur abundance, [S/H]$\sim$1.5$\times$10$^{-5}$. Our results
suggest that sulfur depletion depends on the environment. While the abundances
of sulfur-bearing species are consistent with undepleted sulfur in Orion, a
depletion factor of $\sim$20 is required to explain those observed in Taurus
and Perseus. We propose that differences in the grain charge distribution in
the envelopes of the studied clouds might explain these variations. The shocks
associated with past and ongoing star formation could also contribute to
enhance [S/H] in Orion.

sound"", has been attracting increasing attention in relation to various
potential applications such as thermal diodes, waveguides, and so on. Until
recently, second sound had been just a subject of observation because it is
very rarely realised in solids. It has been suggested that ferroelectrics are
strong candidates for thermal-wave media1, and several reports on an incipient
ferroelectric, strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), showed a novel wave-like
excitation in light-scattering spectra2,3, and second sound has been proposed
for the most plausible origin for this excitation based on rather indirect
demonstration3,4. However, the lack of a direct demonstration still leaves
controversy5 on the existence of second sound in SrTiO$_3$. Here we show a
direct demonstration of the optically-generated coherent wave of heat, i.e,
coherent second sound, in bulk single crystals of SrTiO$_3$. The generated
wave-excitation has a linear dispersion relation with a predicted velocity of
second sound in this material, and is overdamped at high temperatures or low
frequencies, exhibiting apparently diffusive behaviour with the decay rates
defined by the known values of the thermal diffusivity of SrTiO$_3$. This work
offers not only convincing evidence for the existence of second sound in
SrTiO$_3$, but also a first demonstration of coherent generation and
wave-control of gigahertz temperature fields in a 3D bulk material. As
high-quality SrTiO$_3$ is widely available, and it is also known as a mother
material of superconductors, the coherent excitation of temperature wave in
this material offers a pathway for potential novel wave-based applications in
heat management such as construction of thermal waveguides and directional
devices, or heat-control of superconductivity.

the initiation of collapse between $3 \times 10^4$ and $4 \times 10^4$ yr for

the Hasse-Weil zeta function - which enumerates absolutely irreducible
representations over finite fields of a (profinite) group $G$. The zeta
function converges on a complex half-plane for all UBERG groups and admits an
Euler product decomposition. Our motivation for this investigation is the
observation that the reciprocal value $\zeta_G(k)^{-1}$ at a positive integer
$k$ coincides with the probability that $k$ random elements generate the
completed group ring of $G$. The explicit formulas obtained so far suggest that
$\zeta_G$ is rather well-behaved.
  A central object of this article is the abscissa of convergence $a(G)$ of
$\zeta_G$. We calculate the abscissae for free abelian, free abelian pro-$p$,
free pro-$p$, free pronilpotent and free prosoluble groups. More generally, we
obtain bounds (and sometimes explicit values) for the abscissae of free
pro-$\mathfrak{C}$ groups, where $\mathfrak{C}$ is a class of finite groups

functions in $p^{-s}$ if $G$ is virtually abelian. For finite groups $G$ we
calculate $\zeta_G$ using the rational representation theory of $G$.

such risk is training data extraction from language models that have been

In our study, we investigate the extent of named entity memorization in

representative downstream task and employ three different fine-tuning setups in
our experiments, including one with Differentially Privacy (DP). We create a
large number of text samples from the fine-tuned BERT models utilizing a custom
sequential sampling strategy with two prompting strategies. We search in these
samples for named entities and check if they are also present in the
fine-tuning datasets. We experiment with two benchmark datasets in the domains
of emails and blogs. We show that the application of DP has a huge effect on
the text generation capabilities of BERT. Furthermore, we show that a
fine-tuned BERT does not generate more named entities entities specific to the
fine-tuning dataset than a BERT model that is pre-trained only. This suggests
that BERT is unlikely to emit personal or privacy sensitive named entities.
Overall, our results are important to understand to what extent BERT-based
services are prone to training data extraction attacks.

its flavor oscillation. In a dense neutrino gas such as that inside a
core-collapse supernova or the black hole accretion disk formed in a compact
binary merger, however, these ""collision"" processes can trigger large flavor
conversion in cooperation with the strong neutrino-neutrino refraction. We show
that there exist two types of collisional flavor instability in a homogeneous
and isotropic neutrino gas which are identified by the dependence of their real
frequencies on the neutrino density $n_\nu$. The instability transitions from
one type to the other and exhibits a resonance-like behavior in the region
where the net electron lepton number of the neutrino gas is negligible. In the
transition region, the flavor instability grows exponentially at a rate
$\propto n_\nu^{1/2}$. We find that the neutrino gas in the black hole
accretion disk is susceptible to the collision-induced flavor conversion where
the neutrino densities are the highest. As a result, large amounts of
heavy-lepton flavor neutrinos can be produced through flavor conversion, which
can have important ramifications in the subsequent evolution of the remnant.

CARMENES, and STELLA high-resolution spectrographs. We used these spectra to
derive radial velocities together with a complete set of stellar physical
parameters. We then investigated radial velocities signals and discussed the
fraction of planets in such systems. We also re-analyzed the ages of our
targets, which were used to derive the physical parameters of wide brown dwarf
companions. Finally, a compilation of systems with known planets from the
literature is considered along with our sample to search for possible
peculiarities in their parameter distributions. Results. Based on the derived
ages of six observed systems, we re-computed the masses of the wide companions,
confirming their substellar nature. We confirmed planets in the HD 3651 and HIP
70849 systems and found a new planetary candidate in the HD 46588 system. In
our survey, which is sensitive mostly to Neptune-mass planets at short periods
of a few days and Saturn-mass planets at longer periods of hundreds of days, we
derived a frequency of planets orbiting stars with wide brown dwarf companions
below 70% with the uncertainties included. Comparing the parameter
distributions of our sample with single stars, we observe the enhancement of
planets with short periods below six days in systems with a wide stellar
companion. Finally, planets in systems with wide BD companions follow their own
eccentricity distribution with a maximum at $\sim0.65$ and have periods larger

flame shows both head-on quenching and side-wall quenching-like behavior that
significantly affects the CO formation in the near-wall region. The detailed
insights from the simulation are used to evaluate a recently proposed flame
(tip) vortex interaction mechanism identified from experiments on turbulent
side-wall quenching. It describes the entrainment of burnt gases into the fresh
gas mixture near the flame's quenching point. The flame behavior and
thermochemical states observed in the simulation are similar to the phenomena
observed in the experiments. A novel chemistry manifold is presented that
accounts for both the effects of flame dilution due to exhaust gas
recirculation in the flame vortex interaction area and enthalpy losses to the

points (WPs) with a topological charge of n = 2, 3 and 4, and with both linear
and quadratic energy tilt. The linear tilt always tends to squeeze the Landau
levels (LLs) of both conduction and valence bands of all the WPs, and
eventually leads to LL collapse in the type-II phase. However, the quadratic
energy tilt has more complex influences on the LLs of the unconventional WPs.
For charge-n (n = 2, 4) WP, the influence of the quadratic tilt on the LLs of
conduction and valence bands are opposite, i.e. if the LLs of conduction
(valence) bands are squeezed, then that of the valence (conduction) bands are
broadened, and the squeezed LL spectrum will be collapsed in type-III phase.
But, the LL collapse generally can not be found in the type-III charge-3 WP.
Moreover, for charge-n (n = 2, 3) WP, the quadratic tilt breaks the degeneracy
of the chiral LLs regardless of the direction of the magnetic field, leading to
additional optical transitions and magneto-optical conductivity peaks at low
frequencies. Interestingly, the four chiral LLs in charge-4 WP are always not
degenerate. Hence, there inevitably exist magneto-optical conductivity peaks at
low frequencies for charge-4 WP. Since the density of state of the LL spectrum
is very large, one can expect that the low-frequency magneto-optical responses
in unconventional WPs would be significant and may be used for developing
efficient terahertz photodetectors.

The two-loop contributions to the effective action are given by harmonic

objective consists in building receiving nodes that implement conditional
operations on incoming photons, using the interaction with a single stationary
qubit. In particular, the quest for scalable nodes motivated the development of
cavity-enhanced spin-photon interfaces with solid-state emitters. An important
challenge remains, however, to produce a stable, controllable, spin-dependant
photon state, in a deterministic way. Here we use a pillar-based high-Q cavity,
embedding a singly-charged semiconductor quantum dot, to demonstrate the
control of giant polarisation rotations induced by a single electron spin. A
complete tomography approach is used to deduce the output polarisation Stokes
vector, conditioned by a single spin state. We experimentally demonstrate
rotation amplitudes such as $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\pi$ in the Poincar\'e
sphere, as required for applications based on spin-polarisation mapping and
spin-mediated photon-photon gates. In agreement with our modeling, we observe
that the environmental noise does not limit the amplitude of the spin-induced
rotation, yet slightly degrades the polarisation purity of the output states.
We find that the polarisation state of the reflected photons can be manipulated
in most of the Poincar\'e sphere, through controlled spin-induced rotations,
thanks to moderate cavity birefringence and limited noise. This control allows
the operation of spin-photon interfaces in various configurations, including at
zero or low magnetic fields, which ensures compatibility with key protocols for
photonic cluster state generation.

laminar methane-air flames undergoing side-wall quenching (SWQ) is performed. A
well-established SWQ burner is adapted to allow the seeding of the main flow
with additional gaseous products issued from a (secondary) wall inlet close to
the flame's quenching point. First, the characteristics of the partially
premixed flame that quenches at the wall are assessed using planar
laser-induced fluorescence measurements of the OH radical, and a corresponding
numerical simulation with fully-resolved transport and chemistry is conducted.
A boundary layer of enriched mixture is formed at the wall, leading to a
reaction zone parallel to the wall for high injection rates from the wall
inlet. Subsequently, in a numerical study, the wall inflow is mixed with
dimethylmethylphosphonat (DMMP), a phosphor-based flame retardant. The DMMP
addition allows the assessment of the combined effects of heat loss and flame
retardants on the flame structure during flame-wall interaction. With an
increasing amount of DMMP in the injected mixture, the flame stabilizes further
away from the wall and shows a decrease in the local heat-release rate.
Thereby, the maximum wall heat flux is significantly reduced. That results in a
lower thermal load on the quenching wall. The flame structure analysis shows an
accumulation of the intermediate species HOPO at the wall similar to the CO
accumulation during the quenching of premixed flames without flame retardant
addition. The study shows how the structure of a partially premixed flame is
influenced by a wall that releases either additional fuel or a mixture of fuel
and flame retardant. The insights gained from the canonical configuration can
lead to a better understanding of the combined effects of flame retardants and
heat losses in near-wall flames.

neural activity may provide a powerful avenue for identifying and interpreting
the dynamical motifs underlying biological computation. Given that neural
variance alone does not uniquely determine a latent dynamical system,
interpretable architectures should prioritize accurate and low-dimensional
latent dynamics. In this work, we evaluated the performance of sequential
autoencoders (SAEs) in recovering latent chaotic attractors from simulated
neural datasets. We found that SAEs with widely-used recurrent neural network
(RNN)-based dynamics were unable to infer accurate firing rates at the true
latent state dimensionality, and that larger RNNs relied upon dynamical
features not present in the data. On the other hand, SAEs with neural ordinary
differential equation (NODE)-based dynamics inferred accurate rates at the true
latent state dimensionality, while also recovering latent trajectories and
fixed point structure. Ablations reveal that this is mainly because NODEs (1)
allow use of higher-capacity multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to model the vector
field and (2) predict the derivative rather than the next state. Decoupling the
capacity of the dynamics model from its latent dimensionality enables NODEs to
learn the requisite low-D dynamics where RNN cells fail. Additionally, the fact
that the NODE predicts derivatives imposes a useful autoregressive prior on the
latent states. The suboptimal interpretability of widely-used RNN-based
dynamics may motivate substitution for alternative architectures, such as NODE,
that enable learning of accurate dynamics in low-dimensional latent spaces.

utilizing priority thresholds that guide decisions regarding which youth should
start receiving service based on the number of beds idle in the system. Our
approach involves an $M/M/N/\{K_j\}+M$ queuing model with many statistically
identical servers (beds) and RHY from different demographic groups with limited
patience arriving to the a large crisis and emergency shelter in NYC. The
queuing model allows us to: (i) investigate the populations and demographics
that are facing access barriers, (ii) project the minimum number of beds
required to provide a certain global service quality level to all youth,
regardless of demographic characteristics, and (iii) use priority thresholds
while matching RHY with beds to promote equity. The recommendations regarding
the capacity expansion and priority thresholds improves equitable access to
this crisis and emergency shelter by decreasing the average number of RHY
abandoning the system by 92%, with a particular reduction in the abandonment of
RHY who are at high-risk of experiencing trafficking.

analysis using the quasi-DNS as a reference both in the context of
Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulations (LESs). The
analysis of the joint PDF demonstrates the high complexity of the reactive
scalar distribution in the near-wall region. Here, a high correlation between
the progress variable and enthalpy is found, where the flame propagation and
quenching are present simultaneously. The transported PDF approach presented in
this work, based on the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments, accounts for
the moments of the joint PDF of progress variable and enthalpy coupled to a
Quenching-Flamelet Generated Manifold. In the a priori analysis both turbulence
chemistry interaction PDF closure models show a high accuracy in the core flow.
In the near-wall region, however, only the Conditional Quadrature Method of

reduce error accumulation by pseudo-labeling the target samples based on

study is crucial in many applications. In practice, raw link streams are often
aggregated or transformed into time series or graphs where decisions are made.
Yet, it remains unclear how the dynamical and structural information of a raw
link stream carries into the transformed object. This work shows that it is
possible to shed light into this question by studying link streams via
algebraically linear graph and signal operators, for which we introduce a novel
linear matrix framework for the analysis of link streams. We show that, due to
their linearity, most methods in signal processing can be easily adopted by our
framework to analyze the time/frequency information of link streams. However,
the availability of linear graph methods to analyze relational/structural
information is limited. We address this limitation by developing (i) a new
basis for graphs that allow us to decompose them into structures at different
resolution levels; and (ii) filters for graphs that allow us to change their
structural information in a controlled manner. By plugging-in these
developments and their time-domain counterpart into our framework, we are able
to (i) obtain a new basis for link streams that allow us to represent them in a

euclidean space, can be seen as simple filters in our frequency-structure

scenarios enabling autonomous vehicles to perform safe and efficient planning.
The evolution of these scenarios is highly uncertain and depends on the
interactions of agents with static and dynamic objects in the scene. GNN-based
approaches have recently gained attention as they are well suited to naturally
model these interactions. However, one of the main challenges that remains
unexplored is how to address the complexity and opacity of these models in
order to deal with the transparency requirements for autonomous driving
systems, which includes aspects such as interpretability and explainability. In
this work, we aim to improve the explainability of motion prediction systems by
using different approaches. First, we propose a new Explainable Heterogeneous
Graph-based Policy (XHGP) model based on an heterograph representation of the
traffic scene and lane-graph traversals, which learns interaction behaviors
using object-level and type-level attention. This learned attention provides
information about the most important agents and interactions in the scene.
Second, we explore this same idea with the explanations provided by
GNNExplainer. Third, we apply counterfactual reasoning to provide explanations
of selected individual scenarios by exploring the sensitivity of the trained
model to changes made to the input data, i.e., masking some elements of the
scene, modifying trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents. The
explainability analysis provided in this paper is a first step towards more
transparent and reliable motion prediction systems, important from the
perspective of the user, developers and regulatory agencies. The code to

presents the concept of multi-service edge-intelligence which revolves around
tight integration of wireless access, edge-computing and machine learning
techniques, in order to provide stability guarantees under wireless

multi-service edge-intelligence. It also presents a temporal-adaptive
prediction technique to cope with dynamically changing wireless environments.
It provides performance results in a robotic teleoperation scenario. Finally,

training on a large set of task-specific examples. This paradigm seriously
hinders the development of task generalization since preparing a task-specific
example set is costly. To build a system that can quickly and easily generalize
to new tasks, task instructions have been adopted as an emerging trend of
supervision recently. These instructions give the model the definition of the
task and allow the model to output the appropriate answer based on the
instructions and inputs. However, task instructions are often expressed in
different forms, which can be interpreted from two threads: first, some
instructions are short sentences and are pretrained language model (PLM)
oriented, such as prompts, while other instructions are paragraphs and are
human-oriented, such as those in Amazon MTurk; second, different end-users very
likely explain the same task with instructions of different textual
expressions. A robust system for task generalization should be able to handle
any new tasks regardless of the variability of instructions.
  However, the system robustness in dealing with instruction-driven task
generalization is still unexplored. This work investigates the system
robustness when the instructions of new tasks are (i) manipulated, (ii)
paraphrased, or (iii) from different levels of conciseness. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that systematically studies how robust a PLM is when it
is supervised by instructions with different factors of variability.

experimentally studied, but restricted to sequential unsharp measurements.
However, it has been theoretically shown recently that projective measurements
are sufficient for recycling nonlocality [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 230402
(2022)]. Here, we go beyond unsharp measurement scenarios and experimentally
demonstrate the recycling of nonlocal resources with projective measurements.
By verifying the violation of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, we
find that three independent parties can recycle the Bell nonlocality of a
two-qubit state, whether it is maximally or partially entangled. Furthermore,
in the double violation region, the optimal trade-off for partially entangled
states can be 11 standard deviations better than that for maximally entangled
states. Our results experimentally eliminate the common misconception that
projective measurements are incompatible with the recycling of quantum
correlations. In addition, our nonlocality recycling setup does not require
entanglement assistance, which is much more experimentally friendly, thus
paving the way for the reuse of other kinds of quantum correlations.

is whether integer programs defined by $\Delta$-modular constraint matrices can
be solved in polynomial time if $\Delta$ is considered constant. The conjecture
is only known to hold true when $\Delta \in \{1,2\}$. In light of this
conjecture, a natural question is to understand structural properties of
$\Delta$-modular matrices. We consider the column number question -- how many
nonzero, pairwise non-parallel columns can a rank-$r$ $\Delta$-modular matrix
have? We prove that for each positive integer $\Delta$ and sufficiently large
integer $r$, every rank-$r$ $\Delta$-modular matrix has at most $\binom{r+1}{2}
+ 80\Delta^7 \cdot r$ nonzero, pairwise non-parallel columns, which is tight up
to the term $80\Delta^7$. This is the first upper bound of the form
$\binom{r+1}{2} + f(\Delta)\cdot r$ with $f$ a polynomial function. Underlying
our results is a partial list of matrices that cannot exist in a
$\Delta$-modular matrix. We believe this partial list may be of independent
interest in future studies of $\Delta$-modular matrices.

strongly affected by the assumed SoS, which, due to multipath, nonlinear
propagation, and non-uniform mediums, is challenging at best to select. In this
letter, we propose a Bayesian approach to marginalize the influence of the SoS
on beamformers for imaging. We adapt Bayesian direction-of-arrival estimation
to an imaging setting and integrate a popular minimum variance beamformer over
the posterior of the SoS. To solve the Bayesian integral efficiently, we use
numerical Gauss quadrature. We apply our beamforming approach to shallow water
sonar imaging where multipath and nonlinear propagation is abundant. We compare
against the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and
demonstrate that its Bayesian counterpart achieves improved range and azimuthal

shift, that is widely encountered in large-scale land use/land cover map
calculation, and the scarcity of pixel-level ground truth that is crucial for
supervised semantic segmentation. Studies focusing on adversarial domain
adaptation via re-styling source domain samples, commonly through generative
adversarial networks, have reported varying levels of success, yet they suffer
from semantic inconsistencies, visual corruptions, and often require a large
number of target domain samples. In this letter, we propose a new unsupervised
domain adaptation method for the semantic segmentation of very high resolution
images, that i) leads to semantically consistent and noise-free images, ii)
operates with a single target domain sample (i.e. one-shot) and iii) at a
fraction of the number of parameters required from state-of-the-art methods.
More specifically an image-to-image translation paradigm is proposed, based on
an encoder-decoder principle where latent content representations are mixed
across domains, and a perceptual network module and loss function is further
introduced to enforce semantic consistency. Cross-city comparative experiments

circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the

In this work, we study the effect of this hot interior on the atmospheric
circulation and thermal structure of hot and ultra-hot Jupiters. To do so, we
incorporate the population-level predictions from evolutionary models of hot
and ultra-hot Jupiters as input for a suite of General Circulation Models
(GCMs) of their atmospheric circulation with varying semi-major axis and
surface gravity. We conduct simulations with and without a hot interior, and
find that there are significant local differences in temperature of up to
hundreds of Kelvin and in wind speeds of hundreds of m s$^{-1}$ or more across
the observable atmosphere. These differences persist throughout the parameter
regime studied, and are dependent on surface gravity through the impact on
photosphere pressure. These results imply that the internal evolution and

aspects remain poorly understood, particularly concerning the role of quantum
coherence in open quantum systems. On the one hand, coherence leads to
entanglement and even nonlocality. On the other, it may lead to a suppression
of fluctuations, causing violations of thermo-kinetic uncertainty relations
(TUR and KUR) that are valid for classical processes. These represent two
different manifestations of coherence, one depending only on the state of the
system (static) and one depending on two-time correlation functions
(dynamical). Here we employ these manifestations of coherence to determine when
mesoscopic quantum transport can be captured by a classical model based on
stochastic jumps, and when such a model breaks down, implying nonclassical
behavior. To this end, we focus on a minimal model of a double quantum dot
coupled to two thermal reservoirs. In this system, quantum tunneling induces
Rabi oscillations and results in both entanglement and nonlocality, as well as
TUR and KUR violations. These effects, which describe the breakdown of a
classical description, are accompanied by a peak in coherence. Our results
provide guiding principles for the design of out-of-equilibrium devices that
exhibit nonclassical behavior.

federated models, our proposed model achieves privacy and personalization that
is achieved by implicitly disentangling the globally-consistent representation
(i.e. content) from the client-dependent variations (i.e. style). Using such
decomposition, personalized models can generate locally unseen labels while
preserving the given style of the client and can predict the labels for all
clients with high accuracy by training a simple linear classifier on the global

applications, such as data anonymization, by sharing only content. Extensive
experimental evaluation corroborates our findings, and we also provide partial

asteroids, the well-known spin-orbit resonance problem could be changed to a
spin-orbit coupling problem since a decoupled model does not accurately capture
the dynamics of the system. In this paper, having provided a definition for
close binary asteroid systems, we explore the structure of the phase space in a
classical Hamiltonian model for spin-orbit coupling in a binary system. To map
out the geography of resonances analytically and the cartography of resonances
numerically, we reformulate a fourth-order gravitational potential function, in
Poincare variables, via Stokes coefficients. For a binary system with a
near-circular orbit, isolating the Hamiltonian near each resonance yields the
pendulum model. Analysis of the results shows the geographical information,
including the location and width of resonances, is modified due to the
prominent role of the semi-major axis in the spin-orbit coupling model but not
structurally altered. However, this resulted in modified Chirikov criterion to
predict onset of large-scale chaos. For a binary system with arbitrary closed
orbit, we thoroughly surf in the phase space via cartography of resonances
created by fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) maps. The numerical study confirms the
analytical results, provides insight into the spin-orbit coupling, and shows
some bifurcations in the secondary resonances which can occur due to material
transfer. Also, we take the (65803) Didymos binary asteroid as a case to show
analytical and numerical results.

research efforts have been devoted to measuring and mitigating bias, they
mainly study bias from the result-oriented perspective while neglecting the
bias encoded in the decision-making procedure. This results in their inability
to capture procedure-oriented bias, which therefore limits the ability to have
a fully debiasing method. Fortunately, with the rapid development of
explainable machine learning, explanations for predictions are now available to
gain insights into the procedure. In this work, we bridge the gap between
fairness and explainability by presenting a novel perspective of
procedure-oriented fairness based on explanations. We identify the
procedure-based bias by measuring the gap of explanation quality between
different groups with Ratio-based and Value-based Explanation Fairness. The new
metrics further motivate us to design an optimization objective to mitigate the
procedure-based bias where we observe that it will also mitigate bias from the
prediction. Based on our designed optimization objective, we propose a
Comprehensive Fairness Algorithm (CFA), which simultaneously fulfills multiple
objectives - improving traditional fairness, satisfying explanation fairness,
and maintaining the utility performance. Extensive experiments on real-world

dual to an isotropic nearest-neighbor potential. In the thermodynamic limit
this dual potential is shown to decay with distance according to an inverse

electronic, optical, and transport properties. It has been argued that some of
these properties might stem from Weyl nodes at crossing points in the band
structure, and their nontrivial topological textures. However, Weyl nodes in
time-reversal invariant semiconductors are split up in energy, rather than in
momentum, and located deep below (far above) the top (bottom) of the valence
(conduction) band, challenging such an interpretation. Here, instead, we use a
4-band kp Hamiltonian for $p-$type tellurium to show how the k-dependent
spin-orbit interaction mixes up the top two (Weyl node free) and bottom two
(Weyl node containing) valence bands, generating a 3D hedgehog orbital magnetic
texture at the uppermost valence band, accessible to transport already at the
lowest doping. Hedgehog textures are important signatures of Weyl fermion
physics in general and in the context of condensed matter physics arise form
the carriers' wave packet rotation being locked to their propagation
wavevector. For spatially dispersive media, such an induced hedgehog
texture/carrier rotation stabilizes two novel, nonreciprocal and antisymmetric
components to the Hall transport within different weak-localization
(antilocalization) relaxation regimes: the anomalous and planar Hall effects,
usually forbidden by time reversal symmetry. Our AC magnetotransport
measurements on Sn-doped tellurium confirm the theoretical predictions and our

family of algorithmic problems under different choices of the variety. The
special case of the variety consisting of rank-1 matrices already has strong
connections to central problems in different areas like quantum information
theory and tensor decompositions. This problem is known to be NP-hard in the
worst case, even for the variety of rank-1 matrices.
  Surprisingly, despite these hardness results we develop an algorithm that
solves this problem efficiently for ""typical"" subspaces. Here, the subspace $U

potentially with some generic elements of the variety contained in it. Our main
result is a guarantee that our algorithm recovers all the elements of $U$ that

As corollaries, we obtain the following new results:

in quantum entanglement, including determining r-entanglement, complete
entanglement, and genuine entanglement of a subspace. While all of these

beyond tensor decompositions. Here, we recover a decomposition of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^R v_i \otimes w_i$, where the $v_i$ are elements of the variety
$X$. This implies new uniqueness results and genericity guarantees even in the

migration were ~2-4 km/s, this suggests that primordial AWI's ability to
survive planet migration is highly stochastic. However, if proto-EKB objects
and their fragments experienced multiple impact events, nearly all primordial
AWI could have crystallized; such a highly collisional proto-EKB during planet
migration is consistent with the lack of any unambiguous direct detection of
AWI on any icy body. Ultimately, primordial AWI's survival to the present day
depends sensitively on the proto-EKB's size-frequency distribution, which is
currently poorly understood.

by presenting the perceived continuous and sampled moving stimuli side-by-side.
For accurate artifact predictions, BiPMAP utilizes a novel model of the human

biological sciences, yet all these systems fall naturally into universal
equivalence classes: conservative or dissipative, stable or unstable,
compressible or incompressible. Predicting these classes from data remains an
essential open challenge in computational physics at which existing time-series
classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, \texttt{phase2vec}, an
embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful
representations of 2D dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are
produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow
data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. In
an auxiliary training period, embeddings are optimized so that they robustly
encode the equations of unseen data over and above the performance of a
per-equation fitting method. The trained architecture can not only predict the
equations of unseen data, but also, crucially, learns embeddings that respect
the underlying semantics of the embedded physical systems. We validate the
quality of learned embeddings investigating the extent to which physical
categories of input data can be decoded from embeddings compared to standard
blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification
techniques. We find that our embeddings encode important physical properties of
the underlying data, including the stability of fixed points, conservation of

response driven by lipid accumulation. A key component of the inflammatory
response is the interaction between monocyte-derived macrophages and
extracellular lipid. Although concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in the blood are known to affect
plaque progression, their impact on the lipid load of plaque macrophages
remains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a lipid-structured mathematical
model to investigate the impact of blood LDL/HDL levels on plaque composition,
and lipid distribution in plaque macrophages. A reduced subsystem, derived by
summing the equations of the full model, describes the dynamics of biophysical
quantities relating to plaque composition (e.g. total number of macrophages,
total amount of intracellular lipid). We also derive a continuum approximation
of the model to facilitate analysis of the macrophage lipid distribution. The
results, which include time-dependent numerical solutions and asymptotic
analysis of the unique steady state solution, indicate that plaque lipid
content is sensitive to the influx of LDL relative to HDL capacity. The
macrophage lipid distribution evolves in a wave-like manner towards an
equilibrium profile which may be monotone decreasing, quasi-uniform or
unimodal, attaining its maximum value at a non-zero lipid level. Our model also
reveals that macrophage uptake may be severely impaired by lipid accumulation.
We conclude that lipid accumulation in plaque macrophages may serve as a
partial explanation for the defective uptake of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis)
often reported in atherosclerotic plaques.

by dividing the data by a sky-map-weighted model of the spectral structure of

start with the assumption that this correction is complete. However, while BFCC
mitigates the impact of instrumental chromaticity on the data, given realistic

Conventional measurements of DIBs in stellar spectra are complicated by
residuals between observations and best-fit stellar models. To overcome this,
we simultaneously model the spectrum as a combination of stellar, dust, and
residual components, with full posteriors on the joint distribution of the
components. This decomposition is obtained by modeling each component as a draw
from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution in the data-space (the observed
spectrum) -- a method we call ""Marginalized Analytic Data-space Gaussian
Inference for Component Separation"" (MADGICS). We use a data-driven prior for
the stellar component, which avoids missing stellar features not well-modeled
by synthetic spectra. This technique provides statistically rigorous
uncertainties and detection thresholds, which are required to work in the low
signal-to-noise regime that is commonplace for dusty lines of sight. We
reprocess all public Gaia DR3 RVS spectra and present an improved 8621 \r{A}

RVS spectra that are public, and show unprecedented correlation with kinematic
substructure in Galactic CO maps. We validate the catalog, its reported

the logical error rate in error-correcting codes such as the surface code.
  Prior works have used machine-learning-assisted single-shot qubit-state

dissipation, thus limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that waveforms
are highly compressible, and we leverage this property to enable a scalable and
efficient microarchitecture COMPAQT - Compressed Waveform Memory Architecture
for Qubit Control. Waveform memory is read-only and COMPAQT leverages this to
compress waveforms at compile time and store the compressed waveform in the
on-chip memory. To generate the pulse, COMPAQT decompresses the waveform at
runtime and then streams the decompressed waveform to the DACs. Using the
hardware-efficient discrete cosine transform, COMPAQT can achieve, on average,
5x increase in the waveform memory bandwidth, which can enable 5x increase in
the total number of qubits controlled in an RFSoC setup. Moreover, COMPAQT
microarchitecture for cryogenic CMOS ASIC controllers can result in a 2.5x
power reduction over uncompressed baseline. We also propose an adaptive
compression scheme to further reduce the power consumed by the decompression
engine, enabling up to 4x power reduction. We see less than 0.1% degradation in
fidelity when using COMPAQT despite using a lossy compression scheme.

energy ($\eta_\mathrm{E}$ $\sim$ 0.01). The bulk of the mass of the wind is
transported by the warm ($T < 5 \times 10^5$K) phase, while there is a similar
amount of energy transported in the warm and the hot phases ($T > 5 \times

decreasing with higher altitude above the midplane. The wind mass loading is
decreasing (flat) for the warm (hot) phase as a function of the star formation
surface rate density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, while the energy loading shows
inverted trends with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, decreasing for the warm wind and
increasing for the hot wind, although with very shallow slopes. These scalings
are in good agreement with previous simulations of resolved wind driving in the

representations of data used in a wide range of applications. In practice, VAEs
usually require multiple training rounds to choose the amount of information

error (distortion) and the KL divergence (rate) is typically parameterized by a
hyperparameter $\beta$. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Rate VAE (MR-VAE), a
computationally efficient framework for learning optimal parameters

explicitly formulate a response function that maps $\beta$ to the optimal
parameters using hypernetworks. MR-VAEs construct a compact response
hypernetwork where the pre-activations are conditionally gated based on
$\beta$. We justify the proposed architecture by analyzing linear VAEs and
showing that it can represent response functions exactly for linear VAEs. With
the learned hypernetwork, MR-VAEs can construct the rate-distortion curve
without additional training and can be deployed with significantly less
hyperparameter tuning. Empirically, our approach is competitive and often
exceeds the performance of multiple $\beta$-VAEs training with minimal

we conduct a systematic study of quantum query lower bounds on finding
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions, and we
consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th order

lower bounds is $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first
setting, and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$ if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared
smooth). In this paper, we extend all these classical lower bounds to the
quantum setting. They match the classical algorithmic results respectively,
demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup for finding
$\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order
derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs, whether with or without the

obtained by showing that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in

some microscopic understanding of the WGC and SDC. In the present paper we take
the first steps towards a systematic study of Emergence in the context of
string theory. We emphasize the crucial role of the species scale in any EFT
coupled to gravity, and discuss its computation in string theory and general
systems with light towers of states. We then introduce the notion of Emergence
and show how kinetic terms for moduli, gauge bosons and fermions may be
generated. One-loop computations play an important role in Emergence, so we
present detailed calculations in $d$ spacetime dimensions for the wave-function
renormalization of scalars, vectors and fermions. We extend and check the
Emergence Proposal in a number string vacua, including 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$
theories arising from type IIA on a CY$_3$, where the towers at strong coupling
are comprised by D0 and (wrapped) D2-branes, and also elaborate on how
instanton corrections would fit within the emergence picture. Higher
dimensional examples are also discussed, including 6d and 7d models arising
from F-/M-theory on an elliptic CY$_3$ or a $K3$ surface. We also consider 10d
string theories and study in some detail the emergence mechanism in type IIA.
We show as well how the flux potential in 4d may be obtained from the emergence
prescription, by analyzing the corresponding decompactification limits to
M-theory. We find that the required kinetic terms for the dual 3-form fields
can arise upon integrating out towers of massive gravitini (and bosonic
superpartners). Our analysis renders support to the Emergence Proposal, and to
the idea that infinite distance singularities may arise in QG as an intrinsic

parameters on data obtained from density functional calculations considerably
improves the sample efficiency of models trained on more accurate ab-initio

suffice to obtain accurate atomic forces and run large-scale atomistic

possible limitations of transfer learning, especially regarding the design and

Kneser graphs admit a Hamilton cycle, with one notable exception, namely the
Petersen graph $K(5,2)$. This problem received considerable attention in the
literature, including a recent solution for the sparsest case $n=2k+1$. The
main contribution of this paper is to prove the conjecture in full generality.
We also extend this Hamiltonicity result to all connected generalized Johnson

has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element ground set, and an
edge between any two sets whose intersection has size exactly $s$. Clearly, we

vertex-transitive graphs defined by intersecting set systems have a Hamilton
cycle, which settles an interesting special case of Lov\'asz' conjecture on
Hamilton cycles in vertex-transitive graphs from 1970. Our main technical
innovation is to study cycles in Kneser graphs by a kinetic system of multiple
gliders that move at different speeds and that interact over time, reminiscent
of the gliders in Conway's Game of Life, and to analyze this system

subgraphs of an Erd\""os-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$. The problem is
well-understood in the regime $K=\Theta(\log n)$ and in the regime
$K=\Theta(n)$. In the former case it can be reduced to the problem of
estimating the size of largest cliques, and its extensions. In the latter case
the full answer is known up to the order $n^{3\over 2}$ using sophisticated
methods from the theory of spin glasses. The intermediate case $K=n^\alpha,
\alpha\in (0,1)$ however is not well studied and this is our focus. We
establish that that in this regime the density (that is the maximum number of
edges supported by any $K$-node subgraph) is ${1\over 4}K^2+{1+o(1)\over
2}K^{3\over 2}\sqrt{\log (n/K)}$, w.h.p. as $n\to\infty$, and provide more
refined asymptotics under the $o(\cdot)$, for various ranges of $\alpha$. This
extends earlier similar results where this asymptotics was confirmed only when
$\alpha$ is a small constant.
  We extend our results to the case of ''weighted'' graphs, when the weights
have either Gaussian or arbitrary sub-Gaussian distributions. The proofs are
based on the second moment method combined with concentration bounds, the
Borell-TIS inequality for the Gaussian case and the Talagrand's inequality for
the case of distributions with bounded support (including the
$\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ case). The case of general distribution is treated using a
novel symmetrized version of the Lindeberg argument, which reduces the general
case to the Gaussian case. Finally, using the results above we conduct the
landscape analysis of the related Hidden Clique Problem, and establish that it
exhibits an overlap gap property when the size of the clique is $O(n^{2\over
3})$, confirming a hypothesis stated in a previous related work.

This technique is based on our earlier observation regarding the location of
the peak of the $b$ quark energy distribution. Such ""energy-peak"" methods enjoy
a greater degree of model-independence with respect to the kinematics of top
quark production compared to earlier proposals. The CMS experiment has
implemented the energy-peak method using associated $b$-jet energy as an
approximation for $b$ quark energy. The new method uses $B$-hadron decay
lengths, which are related to $b$ quark energies by convolution. The advantage
of the new decay length method is that it can be applied in a way that evades
jet-energy scale (JES) uncertainties. Indeed, CMS has measured the top quark
mass using $B$-hadron decay lengths, but they did not incorporate the
energy-peak method. Therefore, mismodeling of top quark transverse momentum
remains a large uncertainty in their result. We demonstrate that, using
energy-peak methods, this systematic uncertainty can become negligible. We show
that with the current LHC data set, a sub-GeV statistical uncertainty on the
top quark mass can be attained with this method. To achieve a comparable
systematic uncertainty as is true for many methods based on exclusive or
semi-inclusive observables using hadrons, we find that the quark-hadron
transition needs to be described significantly better than is the case with
current fragmentation functions and hadronization models.

equation, the DSHE has a narrow band of unstable wavelengths close to an
instability threshold. This allows for analytical progress to be made. We show
that the amplitude equation for the DSHE close to threshold is a special case
of the anisotropic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (ACGLE) and that seams in
the DSHE correspond to spiral waves in the ACGLE. Seam defects and the
corresponding spiral waves tend to organize themselves into chains, and we
obtain formulas for the velocity of the spiral wave cores and for the spacing

Thomas","Low Variance Off-policy Evaluation with State-based Importance Sampling",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In off-policy reinforcement learning, a behaviour policy performs exploratory
interactions with the environment to obtain state-action-reward samples which
are then used to learn a target policy that optimises the expected return. This
leads to a problem of off-policy evaluation, where one needs to evaluate the
target policy from samples collected by the often unrelated behaviour policy.
Importance sampling is a traditional statistical technique that is often
applied to off-policy evaluation. While importance sampling estimators are
unbiased, their variance increases exponentially with the horizon of the
decision process due to computing the importance weight as a product of action
probability ratios, yielding estimates with low accuracy for domains involving
long-term planning. This paper proposes state-based importance sampling (SIS),
which drops the action probability ratios of sub-trajectories with ""negligible
states"" -- roughly speaking, those for which the chosen actions have no impact
on the return estimate -- from the computation of the importance weight.
Theoretical results demonstrate a smaller exponent for the variance upper bound
as well as a lower mean squared error. To identify negligible states, two
search algorithms are proposed, one based on covariance testing and one based
on state-action values. Using the formulation of SIS, we then analogously
formulate state-based variants of weighted importance sampling, per-decision
importance sampling, and incremental importance sampling based on the
state-action value identification algorithm. Moreover, we note that doubly
robust estimators may also benefit from SIS. Experiments in two gridworld
domains and one inventory management domain show that state-based methods yield
reduced variance and improved accuracy.

range of finite and infinite groups. To study the infinite-group case, we use
and further develop a measure-theoretic formalism that allows us to express
continuous-variable measurements as operator-valued generalizations of
probability measures.
  We apply the monogamy game bound to various physically relevant groups,
yielding realizations of the game in continuous-variable modes as well as in
rotational states of a polyatomic molecule. We obtain explicit strong bounds in
the case of specific group-space and subgroup combinations. As an application,
we provide the first proof of one sided-device independent security of a
squeezed-state continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol against
general coherent attacks.

ubiquitous task used as a building block of many quantum algorithms. Here we
show how to accomplish this task on a noisy quantum processor lacking
full-blown error correction for a special class of quantum circuits dominated
by Clifford gates. Our approach is based on Coherent Pauli Checks (CPCs) that
detect errors in a Clifford circuit by verifying commutation rules between
random Pauli-type check operators and the considered circuit. Our main
contributions are as follows. First, we derive a simple formula for the
probability that a Clifford circuit protected by CPCs contains a logical error.
In the limit of a large number of checks, the logical error probability is
shown to approach the value ${\approx}7\epsilon n/5$, where $n$ is the number
of qubits and $\epsilon$ is the depolarizing error rate. Our formula agrees
nearly perfectly with the numerical simulation results. Second, we show that
CPCs are well-suited for quantum processors with a limited qubit connectivity.
For example, the difference between all-to-all and linear qubit connectivity is
only a 3X increase in the number of CNOT gates required to implement CPCs.
Third, we describe simplified one-sided CPCs which are well-suited for
mitigating measurement errors in the single-shot settings. Finally, we report
an experimental demonstration of CPCs with up to 10 logical qubits and more
than 100 logical CNOT gates. Our experimental results show that CPCs provide a
marked improvement in the logical error probability for the considered task of
sampling the output distribution of quantum circuits.

extremely difficult, so the automated design of CNNs has come into the research
spotlight, which has obtained CNNs that outperform manually-designed CNNs.
However, the computational cost is still the bottleneck of automatically
designing CNNs. In this paper, inspired by transfer learning, a new

leverages multi-source domains, which are smaller datasets than the target

stacking method is proposed to both widen and deepen the evolved block, and a
grid search method is proposed to find optimal stacking solutions. The

accuracy, the proposed method gains its strong competitiveness against the peer

trace disentanglement framework has shown great potential for coping with both
seen and unseen spoof scenarios, but the performance is largely restricted by
the single-modal input. This paper focuses on this issue and presents a
multi-modal disentanglement model which targetedly learns polysemantic spoof
traces for more accurate and robust generic attack detection. In particular,
based on the adversarial learning mechanism, a two-stream disentangling network
is designed to estimate spoof patterns from the RGB and depth inputs,
respectively. In this case, it captures complementary spoofing clues inhering
in different attacks. Furthermore, a fusion module is exploited, which
recalibrates both representations at multiple stages to promote the
disentanglement in each individual modality. It then performs cross-modality
aggregation to deliver a more comprehensive spoof trace representation for
prediction. Extensive evaluations are conducted on multiple benchmarks,
demonstrating that learning polysemantic spoof traces favorably contributes to
anti-spoofing with more perceptible and interpretable results.

Datasets are calculated after a recoding of the source geometries using the
egs++ geometry package and its egs_brachy extensions. Air kerma per history is
calculated in a 10x10x0.05 cm3 voxel located 100 cm from the source along the
transverse axis and then corrected for the lateral and thickness dimensions of
the scoring voxel to give the air kerma on the central axis at a point 100cm
from the source's mid-point. Full-scatter water phantoms with varying voxel
resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. For
validation, data are compared to those from CLRP_TG43v1 and published data.

use air pouches attached to their sides for lateral steering. However, when all
pouches are serially connected, the whole robot can only perform one constant
curvature in free space. It must contact the environment to navigate through
obstacles along paths with multiple turns. This work presents a multi-segment
vine robot that can navigate complex paths without interacting with its
environment. This is achieved by a new steering method that selectively
actuates each single pouch at the tip, providing high degrees of freedom with
few control inputs. A small magnetic valve connects each pouch to a pressure
supply line. A motorized tip mount uses an interlocking mechanism and motorized
rollers on the outer material of the vine robot. As each valve passes through
the tip mount, a permanent magnet inside the tip mount opens the valve so the
corresponding pouch is connected to the pressure supply line at the same
moment. Novel cylindrical pneumatic artificial muscles (cPAMs) are integrated
into the vine robot and inflate to a cylindrical shape for improved bending
characteristics compared to other state-of-the-art vine robots. The motorized
tip mount controls a continuous eversion speed and enables controlled
retraction. A final prototype was able to repeatably grow into different shapes
and hold these shapes. We predict the path using a model that assumes a
piecewise constant curvature along the outside of the multi-segment vine robot.
The proposed multi-segment steering method can be extended to other soft

accurately predict demand for such services can help operators efficiently
allocate drivers to customers, and reduce idle time, improve congestion, and
enhance the passenger experience. This paper proposes UberNet, a deep learning
Convolutional Neural Network for short-term prediction of demand for
ride-hailing services. UberNet empploys a multivariate framework that utilises
a number of temporal and spatial features that have been found in the
literature to explain demand for ride-hailing services. The proposed model
includes two sub-networks that aim to encode the source series of various
features and decode the predicting series, respectively. To assess the
performance and effectiveness of UberNet, we use 9 months of Uber pickup data
in 2014 and 28 spatial and temporal features from New York City. By comparing
the performance of UberNet with several other approaches, we show that the
prediction quality of the model is highly competitive. Further, Ubernet's
prediction performance is better when using economic, social and built
environment features. This suggests that Ubernet is more naturally suited to
including complex motivators in making real-time passenger demand predictions
for ride-hailing services.

of rotating massive stars that leave a black hole by performing a
radiation-viscous-hydrodynamics simulation in numerical relativity. We take
moderately and rapidly rotating compact pre-collapse stellar models derived in
stellar evolution calculations as the initial conditions. We find that the
viscous heating in the disk formed around the central black hole powers an
outflow. For rapidly rotating models, the explosion energy is $\gtrsim
3\times10^{51}$ erg, which is comparable to or larger than that of typical
stripped-envelope supernovae, indicating that a fraction of such supernovae may
be explosions powered by black-hole accretion disks. The explosion energy is
still increasing at the end of the simulations with a rate of $>10^{50}$ erg/s,
and thus, it may reach $\sim10^{52}$ erg. The nucleosynthesis calculation shows
that the mass of $^{56}$Ni amounts to $\gtrsim 0.1M_\odot$, which, together
with the high explosion energy, satisfies the required amount for broad-lined
type Ic supernovae. The moderately rotating models predict small ejecta mass of
order $0.1M_\odot$ and explosion energy of $\lesssim 10^{51}$ erg. Due to the
small ejecta mass, these models may predict a short-timescale transient with
the rise time 3$-$5 d. It can lead to a bright ($\sim10^{44}$ erg/s) transient
like superluminous supernovae in the presence of dense massive circum-stellar
medium. Irrespective of the models, the lowest value of the electron fraction
of the ejecta is $\gtrsim 0.4$, and thus, the synthesis of heavy $r$-process
elements is not found in our calculation.

customers' loads and generations. The approach is based on a geometric
construction strictly included within the feasible region of a linear
unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow problem that specifies the network
operational constraints. The paper analyses and rigorously shows that the
proposed approach also delivers proportional fairness in capacity allocations,
and demonstrates how the RDOEs can be enlarged by (i) exploiting the knowledge
of customer operational statuses, and (ii) by optimising customers'

  Duality",,"IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2022",,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-convex AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) is a fundamental optimization
problem in power system analysis. The computational complexity of conventional
solvers is typically high and not suitable for large-scale networks in
real-time operation. Hence, deep learning based approaches have gained
intensive attention to conduct the time-consuming training process offline.
Supervised learning methods may yield a feasible AC-OPF solution with a small
optimality gap. However, they often need conventional solvers to generate the
training dataset. This paper proposes an end-to-end unsupervised learning based
framework for AC-OPF. We develop a deep neural network to output a partial set
of decision variables while the remaining variables are recovered by solving AC
power flow equations. The fast decoupled power flow solver is adopted to
further reduce the computational time. In addition, we propose using a modified
augmented Lagrangian function as the training loss. The multipliers are
adjusted dynamically based on the degree of constraint violation. Extensive
numerical test results corroborate the advantages of our proposed approach over
some existing methods.

well-studied and fundamental problems in computer science. In numerous domains
such as robotics, AI, or biology, practitioners develop search heuristics to
accelerate their pathfinding algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex
process to hand-design heuristics based on the problem and the structure of a
given use case. Here we present PHIL (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning),
a novel neural architecture and a training algorithm for discovering graph
search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging recent advances in
imitation learning and graph representation learning. At training time, we
aggregate datasets of search trajectories and ground-truth shortest path
distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based
heuristic function using backpropagation through steps of the pathfinding
process. Our heuristic function learns graph embeddings useful for inferring
node distances, runs in constant time independent of graph sizes, and can be
easily incorporated in an algorithm such as A* at test time. Experiments show
that PHIL reduces the number of explored nodes compared to state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark datasets by 58.5\% on average, can be directly applied in
diverse graphs ranging from biological networks to road networks, and allows
for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.

WEAVE comprises a new 2-degree field-of-view prime-focus corrector system, a
nearly 1000-multiplex fibre positioner, 20 individually deployable 'mini'
integral field units (IFUs), and a single large IFU. These fibre systems feed a
dual-beam spectrograph covering the wavelength range 366$-$959\,nm at

eight individual surveys to: (i) study our Galaxy's origins by completing
Gaia's phase-space information, providing metallicities to its limiting
magnitude for $\sim$3 million stars and detailed abundances for $\sim1.5$
million brighter field and open-cluster stars; (ii) survey $\sim0.4$ million
Galactic-plane OBA stars, young stellar objects and nearby gas to understand
the evolution of young stars and their environments; (iii) perform an extensive
spectral survey of white dwarfs; (iv) survey $\sim400$
neutral-hydrogen-selected galaxies with the IFUs; (v) study properties and
kinematics of stellar populations and ionised gas in $z<0.5$ cluster galaxies;
(vi) survey stellar populations and kinematics in $\sim25\,000$ field galaxies
at $0.3\lesssim z \lesssim 0.7$; (vii) study the cosmic evolution of accretion
and star formation using $>1$ million spectra of LOFAR-selected radio sources;
(viii) trace structures using intergalactic/circumgalactic gas at $z>2$.
Finally, we describe the WEAVE Operational Rehearsals using the WEAVE
Simulator.

within the standard scheme of a tunneling decay where the $\alpha$ particle
tunnels through the potential barrier formed by its interaction with the
daughter nucleus. Following the observation that there exist several excited
levels with the possibility of an $\alpha$ decay when the daughter nucleus is
at a shell closure, we focus in particular on decays producing daughter nuclei
with the neutron number, N = 126. Within a statistical approach we find that
the half-lives, $t_{1/2}(T)$, for temperatures ranging from $T$ = 0 to 2.4 GK
can decrease by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude with the exception of the decay of
$^{212}$Po which decays to the doubly magic daughter $^{208}$Pb, where
$t_{1/2}(T)$ decreases by 5 orders of magnitude. The effect of these thermally
enhanced $\alpha$ decays on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis can be significant

standard derivation relation, it is shown that adding reversal-bounded counters
does not increase the capacity, and states are enough. Also, state grammars
with reversal-bounded counters that operate using leftmost derivations are
shown to coincide with languages accepted by one-way machines with a pushdown
and reversal-bounded counters, and these are surprisingly shown to be strictly
weaker than state grammars with the standard derivation relation (and no
counters). The complexity of the emptiness problem involving state grammars
with reversal-bounded counters is also studied.

of galaxies observed at fixed inclinations, (c) line-of-sight velocity,
dispersion, and flux maps together for two separate subsamples of edge-on
galaxies with similar amount of rotation, and (d) line-of-sight velocity,

utilizes a domain adaptation (DA) technique. The DA module transfers the
accumulated knowledge in contrasting no-damage and damage cases in the source
domain to the target domain, given only the target's no-damage case.
High-dimensional features allow employing signal processing domain knowledge to
devise a generalizable DA approach. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
architecture is adopted for learning since its optimization process
accommodates high-dimensional inputs in a zero-shot setting. At the same time,
its training objective conforms seamlessly with the case of no-damage and
damage data in SHM since its discriminator network differentiates between real

experimental results demonstrates the method's success in transferring
knowledge on differences between no-damage and damage cases across three
strongly heterogeneous independent target structures. The area under the

phenomena have implications for systems with nonlinear mechanical constraints,

the same number of clusters per margin, which seems a rather artificial

finite mixture model per margin that allows each margin to have a different
number of clusters, and then cluster the multivariate data using a strategy
game-inspired algorithm to which we call Reign-and-Conquer. Second, since the
proposed clustering approach only specifies a model for the margins -- but
leaves the joint unspecified -- it has the advantage of being partially
parallelizable; hence, the proposed approach is computationally appealing as
well as more tractable for moderate to high dimensions than a `full' (joint)

increases are applied to the problem of detecting the number of sources

estimate the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue of the spatial covariance
matrix $R$ of the sensed data from the sample covariance matrix $\widehat{R}$.
Existing approaches, such as that based on information theoretic criteria, rely
on the closeness of the noise eigenvalues of $\widehat R$ to each other and,
therefore, the sample size has to be quite large when the number of sources is
large in order to obtain a good estimate. The analysis presented in this report
focuses on the splitting of the spectrum of $\widehat{R}$ into noise and signal
eigenvalues. It is shown that, when the number of sensors is large, the number
of signals can be estimated with a sample size considerably less than that
required by previous approaches. The practical significance of the main result

(MFRs) and can possess a three-part structure in white-light coronagraphs,
including a bright front, dark cavity and bright core. In the traditional
opinion, the bright front forms due to the plasma pileup along the MFR border,
the cavity represents the cross section of the MFR, and the bright core
corresponds to the erupted prominence. However, this explanation on the nature
of the three-part structure is being challenged. In this paper, we report an
intriguing event occurred on 2014 June 14 that was recorded by multiple space-
and ground-based instruments seamlessly, clearly showing that the CME front
originates from the plasma pileup along the magnetic arcades overlying the MFR,
and the core corresponds to a hot-channel MFR. Thus the dark cavity is not an
MFR, instead it is a low-density zone between the CME front and a trailing MFR.
These observations are consistent with a new explanation on the CME structure.
If the new explanation is correct, most (if not all) CMEs should exhibit the
three-part appearance in their early eruption stage. To examine this
prediction, we make a survey study of all CMEs in 2011 and find that all limb
events have the three-part feature in the low corona, regardless of their
appearances in the high corona. Our studies suggest that the three-part
structure is the intrinsic structure of CMEs, which has fundamental importance
for understanding CMEs.

triggered by radiation and thermal drivers around the central mass accumulation

is $1.3\times 10^{-5}$ pc, and no restrictions are put on the geometry of the
inflow/outflow. The central mass is considered {\it prior} to the formation of
the supermassive black hole seed at redshift of $z\sim 15.9$, and can
constitute either a supermassive star (SMS) of $\sim 10^5\,M_\odot$ surrounded
by growing accretion disk or a self-gravitating disk. The radiation transfer is
modeled using the ray-tracing algorithm. Due to the high accretion rate of
$\sim 1\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ determined by the DM halo, accretion is
supercritical, resulting in supercritical luminosity which affects the inflow
rate, with the duty cycle of $\sim 0.9$. We observe a fast development of hot
cavities which quickly extend into polar funnels and expanding dense shells.
Within the funnels, fast winds, $\sim 10^3\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, are mass-loaded
by the accreting gas. We follow the expanding shells to $\sim 1$ pc, when the
shell velocity remains substantially, $\sim 5$ times, above the escape speed.
The ionization cones formed by the central UV/X-ray flux extend to the halo
virial radius, $R_{\rm h}$. Extrapolating the outflow properties shows that the
halo material outside the shell will have difficulty to stop it. We therefore
conclude that the expanding wind-driven shell will breakout of the central
parsec and will reach $\sim R_{\rm h}$. Finally, the anisotropic accretion flow
on sub-parsec scales will attenuate the soft X-rays effect on the H$_2$. Hence,
formation of funnels and powerful outflows around, e.g., SMS, can have
interesting observational corollaries, to be addressed elsewhere.

method that uses a polarization splitter-rotator. The chip was fabricated using
a standard silicon photonics foundry; it has a compact design and is suitable
for mass production. In the experimental stability test, an average quantum bit
error rate of $0.56\%$ was achieved through continuous operation for 10 h

algorithm, the chip enabled the automatic compensation of the fiber
polarization drift, which was emulated by a random fiber polarization
scrambler. In the case of the QKD demonstration, we obtained a finite-key

stable matching requires communication: one cannot find or verify a stable
match without having access to essentially all of the ordinal preference
information held privately by the agents in the market. Stated differently,
these results show that stable matching mechanisms are not robust to even a
small number of labeled inaccuracies in the input preferences. In practice,
these results indicate that agents must go through the time-intensive process
of accurately ranking each and every potential match candidate if they wish for
the resulting match to be guaranteedly stable. Thus, in large markets,
communication requirements for stable matching may be impractically high.
  A natural question to ask, given this result, is whether some higher-order
structure in the market can indicate which large markets have steeper
communication requirements. In this paper, we perform such an analysis in a
regime where agents have a utility-based notion of preference. We consider a
dynamic model where agents only have access to an approximation of their
utility that satisfies a universal multiplicative error bound. We apply
guarantees from the theoretical computer science literature on low-distortion
embeddings of finite metric spaces to understand the communication requirements
of stable matching in large markets in terms of their structural properties.
Our results show that for a broad family of markets, the error bound may not
grow faster than $n^2\log(n)$ while maintaining a deterministic guarantee on
the behavior of stable matching mechanisms in the limit. We also show that a
stronger probabilistic guarantee may be made so long as the bound grows at most
logarithmically in the underlying topological complexity of the market.

to comprehend FRB origin is to probe the physical environments of FRB host
galaxies. Mapping molecular-gas kinematics in FRB host galaxies is critical
because it results in star formation that is likely connected to the birth of
FRB progenitors. However, most previous works of FRB host galaxies have focused
on its stellar component. Therefore, we, for the first time, report the
molecular gas kinematics in the host galaxy of the non-repeating FRB 180924B at
$z= 0.3216$. Two velocity components of the CO (3-2) emission line are detected
in its host galaxy with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA): the peak of one component ($-155.40$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the centre of
the host galaxy, and another ($-7.76$ km s$^{-1}$) is near the FRB position.
The CO (3-2) spectrum shows asymmetric profiles with A$_{\rm peak}$ $=2.03\pm
0.39$, where A$_{\rm peak}$ is the peak flux density ratio between the two
velocity components. The CO (3-2) velocity map also indicates an asymmetric
velocity gradient from $-180$ km s$^{-1}$ to 8 km s$^{-1}$. These results
indicate a disturbed kinetic structure of molecular gas in the host galaxy.
Such disturbed kinetic structures are reported for repeating FRB host galaxies
using HI emission lines in previous works. Our finding indicates that
non-repeating and repeating FRBs could commonly appear in disturbed kinetic
environments, suggesting a possible link between the gas kinematics and FRB

propose an interpretable Anomaly Detection framework using Causal Algorithmic
Recourse (ADCAR), which recommends recourse actions and infers counterfactual
of abnormal samples guided by the causal mechanism. Experiments on three

TensorFlow and PyTorch. As deep learning is now prevalent, the security of deep
learning libraries is a key concern. Fuzzing deep learning libraries presents
two challenges. Firstly, to reach the functionality of the libraries, fuzzers
have to use inputs from the valid input domain of each API function, which may
be unknown. Secondly, many inputs are redundant. Randomly sampled invalid
inputs are likely not to trigger new behaviors. While existing approaches
partially address the first challenge, they overlook the second challenge.
  We propose SkipFuzz, an approach for fuzzing deep learning libraries. To
generate valid inputs, SkipFuzz learns the input constraints of each API
function using active learning. By using information gained during fuzzing,
SkipFuzz infers a model of the input constraints, and, thus, generate valid
inputs. SkipFuzz comprises an active learner which queries a test executor to
obtain feedback for inference. After constructing hypotheses, the active
learner poses queries and refines the hypotheses using the feedback from the
test executor, which indicates if the library accepts or rejects an input,
i.e., if it satisfies the input constraints or not. Inputs from different
categories are used to invoke the library to check if a set of inputs satisfies
a function's input constraints. Inputs in one category are distinguished from
other categories by possible input constraints they would satisfy, e.g. they
are tensors of a certain shape. As such, SkipFuzz is able to refine its
hypothesis by eliminating possible candidates of the input constraints. This
active learning-based approach addresses the challenge of redundant inputs.
Using SkipFuzz, we have found and reported 43 crashes. 28 of them have been

Inspired by this event, we have performed numerical simulations of light curves
of SS Cyg by varying mass transfer rates and varying viscosity parameters in
the cool disk. We have also studied the effect of gas-stream overflows beyond
the outer disk edge in the light curve simulations. We have confirmed that the
enhanced mass transfer is unlikely responsible for the 2021 anomalous event and
its forerunner. We have found that the enhancement of the viscosity in the disk
may reproduce the forerunner of that event but may not be enough to explain the
2021 anomalous event, although the latter result might be particular to our
thermal equilibrium curve used. Within our simulations, a model of the gas
stream overflow with a slightly higher mass transfer rate than that of our

topologically protected states, whose dimensionality is lower than the
dimensionality of the structure at least by 2. Among the most intriguing
examples of such states are zero-dimensional corner modes existing in
two-dimensional higher-order insulators. In contrast to corner states, recently
discovered disclination states also belong to the class of higher-order
topological states, but are bound to the boundary of the disclination defect of
the higher-order topological insulator and can be predicted using the
bulk-disclination correspondence principle. Here, we present the first example
of the nonlinear photonic disclination state bifurcating from its linear
counterpart in the disclination lattice with a pentagonal or heptagonal core.
We show that nonlinearity allows to tune location of the disclination states in
the bandgap and notably affects their shapes. The structure of the disclination
lattice is crucial for stability of these nonlinear topological states: for
example, disclination states are stable in the heptagonal lattice and are
unstable nearly in the entire gap of the pentagonal lattice. Nonlinear
disclination states reported here are thresholdless and can be excited even at
low powers. Nonlinear zero-energy states coexisting in these structures with
disclination states are also studied. Our results suggest that disclination
lattices can be used in the design of various nonlinear topological functional
devices, while disclination states supported by them may play an important role
in applications, where strong field confinement together with topological
protection are important, such as the design of topological lasers and
enhancement of generation of high harmonics.

observation that shows tension between the physics of galaxy rotation and its
rotational velocity. We compare the brightness of galaxies, and find that
galaxies that spin in the same direction as the Milky Way have different
brightness than galaxies that spin in the opposite direction. While such
difference in brightness is expected due to Doppler shift, it is expected to be
subtle. The results show that the difference in brightness is large enough to
be detected by Earth-based telescopes. That observed difference corresponds to
physical properties of galaxies with far greater rotational velocity than the
rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The difference is consistent in both the
Northern galactic pole and the Southern galactic pole, and is not observed in
parts of the sky that are perpendicular to the galactic pole. The differences
are observed by several different instruments such DECam, SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and
HST. The observation is also consistent across annotation methods, including
different computer-based methods, manual annotation, or crowdsourcing
annotations through Galaxy Zoo, all show similar results. Another possible
explanation to the observation is parity violation in the large-scale
structure, such that the magnitude of the parity violation was stronger in the
earlier Universe. It can also be linked to other anomalies such as the Ho
tension. Analysis of Ho using Ia supernovae shows smaller Ho tension when the

Despite the flexibility in real-world modeling, ABMs have received less

highly diverse and have a property of quite different distribution from
conditional modalities, such as textual descriptors in natural languages, it is
hard to learn a probabilistic mapping from the desired conditional modality to
the human motion sequences. Besides, the raw motion data from the motion
capture system might be redundant in sequences and contain noises; directly
modeling the joint distribution over the raw motion sequences and conditional
modalities would need a heavy computational overhead and might result in
artifacts introduced by the captured noises. To learn a better representation
of the various human motion sequences, we first design a powerful Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) and arrive at a representative and low-dimensional latent

masses and system orientation. Here we present the results of timing campaigns
on seven binary millisecond pulsars observed with the 64-antenna MeerKAT radio
telescope that show evidence of Shapiro delay: PSRs~J0101$-$6422, J1101$-$6424,
J1125$-$6014, J1514$-$4946, J1614$-$2230, J1732$-$5049, and J1909$-$3744.
Evidence for Shapiro delay was found in all of the systems, and for three the
orientations and data quality enabled strong constraints on their orbital
inclinations and component masses. For PSRs~J1125$-$6014, J1614$-$2230 and
J1909$-$3744, we determined pulsar masses to be $M_{\rm p} = 1.68\pm 0.17 \,
{\rm M_{\odot}} $, $1.94\pm 0.03 \, {\rm M_{\odot}} $ and $1.45 \pm 0.03 \,
{\rm M_{\odot}}$, and companion masses to be $M_{\rm c} = 0.33\pm 0.02 \, {\rm
M_{\odot}} $, $0.495\pm 0.005 \, {\rm M_{\odot}} $ and $0.205 \pm 0.003 \, {\rm
M_{\odot}}$, respectively. This provides the first independent confirmation of
PSR~J1614$-$2230's mass, one of the highest known. The Shapiro delays measured
for PSRs~J0101$-$6422, J1101$-$6424, J1514$-$4946, and J1732$-$5049 were only
weak, and could not provide interesting component mass limits. Despite a large
number of millisecond pulsars being routinely timed, relatively few have
accurate masses via Shapiro delays. We use simulations to show that this is
expected, and provide a formula for observers to assess how accurately a pulsar
mass can be determined. We also discuss the observed correlation between pulsar
companion masses and spin period, and the anti-correlation between recycled
pulsar mass and their companion masses.

for securing the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Cross
Entropy (CE) loss has been shown to be not robust to noisy labels due to its
unboundedness. To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design
specialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to
the underfitting issue. In this paper, our key idea is to induce a loss bound
at the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustness of existing
losses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the
norm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In
this manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded,
mitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels. Moreover, we present
theoretical analyses to certify the noise-tolerant ability of LogitClip.
Extensive experiments show that LogitClip not only significantly improves the
noise robustness of CE loss, but also broadly enhances the generalization

scientific and engineering problems, where physical laws are introduced into

enable the estimation of critical parameters, which are unobservable via
physical tools, through observable variables. For example, Power Electronic
Converters (PECs) are essential building blocks for the green energy
transition. PINNs have been applied to estimate the capacitance, which is
unobservable during PEC operations, using current and voltage, which can be
observed easily during operations. The estimated capacitance facilitates
self-diagnostics of PECs. Existing PINNs are often manually designed, which is
time-consuming and may lead to suboptimal performance due to a large number of
design choices for neural network architectures and hyperparameters. In
addition, PINNs are often deployed on different physical devices, e.g., PECs,
with limited and varying resources. Therefore, it requires designing different
PINN models under different resource constraints, making it an even more
challenging task for manual design. To contend with the challenges, we propose
Automated Physics-Informed Neural Networks (AutoPINN), a framework that enables
the automated design of PINNs by combining AutoML and PINNs. Specifically, we
first tailor a search space that allows finding high-accuracy PINNs for PEC

desirable to perform multiple video analytics tasks, which we refer to as
Analytical Units (AUs), off the video feed coming out of every camera. In this
paper, we first show that in a multi-AU setting, changing the camera setting
has disproportionate impact on different AUs performance. In particular, the
optimal setting for one AU may severely degrade the performance for another AU,
and further the impact on different AUs varies as the environmental condition
changes. We then present Elixir, a system to enhance the video stream quality

Reinforcement Learning (MORL), where the RL agent caters to the objectives from
different AUs and adjusts the camera setting to simultaneously enhance the

new AU-specific quality estimator values for each individual AU. We evaluate
Elixir through real-world experiments on a testbed with three cameras deployed

reassignment strategy for training to reduce ranking inconsistency and propose
an anchor pyramid scheme to adaptively determine the anchor density in each

on Grid2Op, an existing simulator and RL interface, and experimented on
limiting the action and observation spaces of Grid2Op. By testing with DDQN and
SliceRDQN algorithms, we found that reduced action spaces significantly improve

  Correspondence",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-view geo-localization aims to estimate the location of a query ground
image by matching it to a reference geo-tagged aerial images database. As an
extremely challenging task, its difficulties root in the drastic view changes
and different capturing time between two views. Despite these difficulties,
recent works achieve outstanding progress on cross-view geo-localization
benchmarks. However, existing methods still suffer from poor performance on the
cross-area benchmarks, in which the training and testing data are captured from
two different regions. We attribute this deficiency to the lack of ability to
extract the spatial configuration of visual feature layouts and models'
overfitting on low-level details from the training set. In this paper, we
propose GeoDTR which explicitly disentangles geometric information from raw
features and learns the spatial correlations among visual features from aerial
and ground pairs with a novel geometric layout extractor module. This module
generates a set of geometric layout descriptors, modulating the raw features
and producing high-quality latent representations. In addition, we elaborate on
two categories of data augmentations, (i) Layout simulation, which varies the
spatial configuration while keeping the low-level details intact. (ii) Semantic
augmentation, which alters the low-level details and encourages the model to
capture spatial configurations. These augmentations help to improve the
performance of the cross-view geo-localization models, especially on the
cross-area benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a counterfactual-based learning
process to benefit the geometric layout extractor in exploring spatial
information. Extensive experiments show that GeoDTR not only achieves
state-of-the-art results but also significantly boosts the performance on

propose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered
around \textit{task vectors}. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight
space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves
performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a
pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a
task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together
through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior
of the resulting model is steered accordingly. Negating a task vector decreases
performance on the target task, with little change in model behavior on control
tasks. Moreover, adding task vectors together can improve performance on
multiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy
relationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D"", combining task vectors from
three of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data
from the fourth task is used for training. Overall, our experiments with

  Supervised Video Anomaly Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weakly supervised video anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal events in
videos using only video-level labels. Recently, two-stage self-training methods
have achieved significant improvements by self-generating pseudo labels and
self-refining anomaly scores with these labels. As the pseudo labels play a
crucial role, we propose an enhancement framework by exploiting completeness
and uncertainty properties for effective self-training. Specifically, we first
design a multi-head classification module (each head serves as a classifier)
with a diversity loss to maximize the distribution differences of predicted
pseudo labels across heads. This encourages the generated pseudo labels to
cover as many abnormal events as possible. We then devise an iterative
uncertainty pseudo label refinement strategy, which improves not only the
initial pseudo labels but also the updated ones obtained by the desired
classifier in the second stage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on the
UCF-Crime, TAD, and XD-Violence benchmark datasets.

with respect to a highly uncertain and heterogeneous response variable of

some covariates, the parameters in this model class provide useful information
about the heterogeneity in the data population, which is represented by the
conditional distributions for the response given the covariates associated with
a number of distinct but latent subpopulations. In this paper, we investigate
conditions of strong identifiability, rates of convergence for conditional
density and parameter estimation, and the Bayesian posterior contraction
behavior arising in finite mixture of regression models, under exact-fitted and
over-fitted settings and when the number of components is unknown. This theory
is applicable to common choices of link functions and families of conditional
distributions employed by practitioners. We provide simulation studies and data
illustrations, which shed some light on the parameter learning behavior found
in several popular regression mixture models reported in the literature.

challenging task, especially when limited supervision is available. Recent
works leverage the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to perform
complex question answering in a few-shot setting by demonstrating how to output
intermediate rationalizations while solving the complex question in a single
pass. We introduce ``Successive Prompting'', where we iteratively break down a
complex task into a simple task, solve it, and then repeat the process until we
get the final solution. Successive prompting decouples the supervision for
decomposing complex questions from the supervision for answering simple
questions, allowing us to (1) have multiple opportunities to query in-context
examples at each reasoning step (2) learn question decomposition separately
from question answering, including using synthetic data, and (3) use bespoke
(fine-tuned) components for reasoning steps where a large LM does not perform
well. The intermediate supervision is typically manually written, which can be
expensive to collect. We introduce a way to generate a synthetic dataset which
can be used to bootstrap a model's ability to decompose and answer intermediate
questions. Our best model (with successive prompting) achieves an improvement
of ~5% absolute F1 on a few-shot version of the DROP dataset when compared with
a state-of-the-art model with the same supervision.

reconstruction of implicit 3D surfaces from noisy point clouds. Previous work
identifies that the spatial arrangement of latent encodings is important to
recover detail. One school of thought is to encode a latent vector for each
point (point latents). Another school of thought is to project point latents
into a grid (grid latents) which could be a voxel grid or triplane grid. Each
school of thought has tradeoffs. Grid latents are coarse and lose
high-frequency detail. In contrast, point latents preserve detail. However,
point latents are more difficult to decode into a surface, and quality and
runtime suffer. In this paper, we propose ALTO to sequentially alternate
between geometric representations, before converging to an easy-to-decode
latent. We find that this preserves spatial expressiveness and makes decoding
lightweight. We validate ALTO on implicit 3D recovery and observe not only a
performance improvement over the state-of-the-art, but a runtime improvement of

Furthermore, we design a task token to narrow the gap between 2D images and 3D

Analysis of the local hydrophobicity (LH) for all residues at the $\alpha_1

T$\rightarrow$R transition, which is encoded in the MWC model, as well as
comparison with earlier computations of the solvent accessible surface area

hydration. Local hydrophobicity quantifies the presence and structure of water
molecules at the interface whereas ``buried surface'' reports on the available
space for solvent. For simulations with Hb frozen in its T$_0$ and R$_4$ states
the correlation coefficient between LH and buried surface is 0.36 and 0.44,
respectively, but it increases considerably if the 95 \% confidence interval is
used. The LH with Hb frozen and flexible changes little for most residues at
the interfaces but is significantly altered for a few select ones, which are
Thr41$\alpha$, Tyr42$\alpha$, Tyr140$\alpha$, Trp37$\beta$, Glu101$\beta$ (for
T$_0$) and Thr38$\alpha$, Tyr42$\alpha$, Tyr140$\alpha$ (for R$_4$). The number
of water molecules at the interface is found to increase by $\sim 25$ \% for
T$_0$$\rightarrow$R$_4$ which is consistent with earlier measurements. Since
hydration is found to be essential to protein function, it is clear that

also stems from these synthesized images since they are often
shadow-inauthentic and details-impaired. In this paper, we present a novel
generation framework, referred to as HQSS, for high-quality pseudo shadow image
synthesis. The given image is first decoupled into a shadow region identity and
a non-shadow region identity. HQSS employs a shadow feature encoder and a
generator to synthesize pseudo images. Specifically, the encoder extracts the
shadow feature of a region identity which is then paired with another region
identity to serve as the generator input to synthesize a pseudo image. The
pseudo image is expected to have the shadow feature as its input shadow feature
and as well as a real-like image detail as its input region identity. To
fulfill this goal, we design three learning objectives. When the shadow feature
and input region identity are from the same region identity, we propose a
self-reconstruction loss that guides the generator to reconstruct an identical
pseudo image as its input. When the shadow feature and input region identity
are from different identities, we introduce an inter-reconstruction loss and a
cycle-reconstruction loss to make sure that shadow characteristics and detail
information can be well retained in the synthesized images. Our HQSS is
observed to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on ISTD dataset, Video

token or an average of all patch tokens, following the architecture of
Transformer in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. However, studies for the best way of
aggregating the patch tokens are still limited to average pooling, while
widely-used pooling strategies, such as max and GeM pooling, can be considered.
Despite their effectiveness, the existing pooling strategies do not consider
the architecture of ViT and the channel-wise difference in the activation maps,
aggregating the crucial and trivial channels with the same importance. In this
paper, we present Group Generalized Mean (GGeM) pooling as a simple yet
powerful pooling strategy for ViT. GGeM divides the channels into groups and
computes GeM pooling with a shared pooling parameter per group. As ViT groups
the channels via a multi-head attention mechanism, grouping the channels by
GGeM leads to lower head-wise dependence while amplifying important channels on
the activation maps. Exploiting GGeM shows 0.1%p to 0.7%p performance boosts
compared to the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance for
ViT-Base and ViT-Large models in ImageNet-1K classification task. Moreover,
GGeM outperforms the existing pooling strategies on image retrieval and
multi-modal representation learning tasks, demonstrating the superiority of
GGeM for a variety of tasks. GGeM is a simple algorithm in that only a few

substantially over the next decade. Key data sources include cosmic microwave
background (CMB) measurements and observations of the distribution of matter at
low-redshift from optical, near-infrared, and 21cm intensity surveys. A
positive detection of a CMB B-mode consistent with a primordial stochastic
gravitational wave background (SGWB) is widely viewed as a smoking gun for an
inflationary phase. Still, a null result does not exclude inflation. However,
in a significant class of inflationary scenarios, a low SGWB amplitude is
correlated with a more significant running, $\alpha_s$, in the primordial
density perturbations than is seen with the simplest inflationary potentials.
With this motivation, we forecast the precision with which the spectral index
$n_{\rm{s}}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{s}}$ can be constrained by currently envisaged
observations, including CMB (Simons Observatory, CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD),
optical/near infra-red (DESI and SPHEREx), and 21cm intensity mapping (Tianlai

constraining the running and show that they may yield additional and
informative constraints on the overall inflationary parameter space if the SGWB

increasingly used method to solve the task of dynamic obstacle avoidance for
mobile robots, autonomous ships, and drones. A common practice to train those
agents is to use a training environment with random initialization of agent and
obstacles. Such approaches might suffer from a low coverage of high-risk
scenarios in training, leading to impaired final performance of obstacle
avoidance. This paper proposes a general training environment where we gain
control over the difficulty of the obstacle avoidance task by using short
training episodes and assessing the difficulty by two metrics: The number of
obstacles and a collision risk metric. We found that shifting the training
towards a greater task difficulty can massively increase the final performance.
A baseline agent, using a traditional training environment based on random
initialization of agent and obstacles and longer training episodes, leads to a
significantly weaker performance. To prove the generalizability of the proposed
approach, we designed two realistic use cases: A mobile robot and a maritime
ship under the threat of approaching obstacles. In both applications, the
previous results can be confirmed, which emphasizes the general usability of
the proposed approach, detached from a specific application context and
independent of the agent's dynamics. We further added Gaussian noise to the
sensor signals, resulting in only a marginal degradation of performance and
thus indicating solid robustness of the trained agent.

long. Such edge states appear in the largest part of the first Brillouin zone

models. However, training these models is challenging due to high computational
costs, painfully slow convergence, and overfitting issues. In this paper, we
present Deep Incubation, a novel approach that enables the efficient and
effective training of large models by dividing them into smaller sub-modules
that can be trained separately and assembled seamlessly. A key challenge for
implementing this idea is to ensure the compatibility of the independently
trained sub-modules. To address this issue, we first introduce a global, shared
meta model, which is leveraged to implicitly link all the modules together, and
can be designed as an extremely small network with negligible computational
overhead. Then we propose a module incubation algorithm, which trains each
sub-module to replace the corresponding component of the meta model and
accomplish a given learning task. Despite the simplicity, our approach
effectively encourages each sub-module to be aware of its role in the target
large model, such that the finally-learned sub-modules can collaborate with
each other smoothly after being assembled. Empirically, our method outperforms
end-to-end (E2E) training in terms of both final accuracy and training
efficiency. For example, on top of ViT-Huge, it improves the accuracy by 2.7%
on ImageNet or achieves similar performance with 4x less training time.
Notably, the gains are significant for downstream tasks as well (e.g., object

states with intrinsic orderings, such as ""ally"", ""neutral"", and ""enemy""
relationships in international relations. These latent states manifest through
countries' cooperative versus conflictual interactions over time. State-space
models (SSMs) explicitly relate the dynamics of observed measurements to
transitions in latent states. For discrete data, SSMs commonly do so through a
state-to-action emission matrix and a state-to-state transition matrix. This
paper introduces the Ordered Matrix Dirichlet (OMD) as a prior distribution
over ordered stochastic matrices wherein the discrete distribution in the kth
row stochastically dominates the (k+1)th, such that probability mass is shifted
to the right when moving down rows. We illustrate the OMD prior within two
SSMs: a hidden Markov model, and a novel dynamic Poisson Tucker decomposition
model tailored to international relations data. We find that models built on
the OMD recover interpretable ordered latent structure without forfeiting
predictive performance. We suggest future applications to other domains where
models with stochastic matrices are popular (e.g., topic modeling), and publish
user-friendly code.

developing countries. Advanced Plug and Play control strategies have been
recently developed with such a decentralized framework in mind, more easily

uncertainties, impacting all major design and decision variables over the
30-year planning horizon, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is implemented for
the design and planning problem tackled. DRL based solutions are benchmarked
against several rigid baseline design options to compare expected performance
under uncertainty. The results on a case study for ger communities in Mongolia
suggest that mobile nomadic energy systems can be both technically and
economically feasible, particularly when considering flexibility, although the
degree of spatial dispersion among households is an important limiting factor.
Key economic, sustainability and resilience indicators such as Cost, Equivalent

as it allows for envisioning future intentions of nearby moving agents. Due to
the lack of other agents' dynamics and control policies, deep neural network
(DNN) models are often employed for trajectory forecasting tasks. Although
there exists an extensive literature on improving the accuracy of these models,
there is a very limited number of works studying their robustness against
adversarially crafted input trajectories. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
propose a targeted adversarial attack against DNN models for trajectory
forecasting tasks. We call the proposed attack TA4TP for Targeted adversarial
Attack for Trajectory Prediction. Our approach generates adversarial input
trajectories that are capable of fooling DNN models into predicting
user-specified target/desired trajectories. Our attack relies on solving a
nonlinear constrained optimization problem where the objective function
captures the deviation of the predicted trajectory from a target one while the
constraints model physical requirements that the adversarial input should
satisfy. The latter ensures that the inputs look natural and they are safe to
execute (e.g., they are close to nominal inputs and away from obstacles). We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TA4TP on two state-of-the-art DNN models and
two datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first targeted
adversarial attack against DNN models used for trajectory forecasting.

continually changing unlabeled target domains without access to the source

self-training manner, such as predicting pseudo labels for new domain datasets.
Since pseudo labels are noisy and unreliable, these methods suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation when dealing with dynamic data
distributions. Motivated by the prompt learning in NLP, in this paper, we
propose to learn an image-level visual domain prompt for target domains while
having the source model parameters frozen. During testing, the changing target
datasets can be adapted to the source model by reformulating the input data
with the learned visual prompts. Specifically, we devise two types of prompts,
i.e., domains-specific prompts and domains-agnostic prompts, to extract current
domain knowledge and maintain the domain-shared knowledge in the continual
adaptation. Furthermore, we design a homeostasis-based prompt adaptation
strategy to suppress domain-sensitive parameters in domain-invariant prompts to
learn domain-shared knowledge more effectively. This transition from the
model-dependent paradigm to the model-free one enables us to bypass the
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems. Experiments show that
our proposed method achieves significant performance gains over

Degradation Relationship Index (DRI) is proposed to measure the degradation
relationship, which is defined as the mean drop rate difference in the
validation loss between two models, i.e., one is trained using the anchor
degradation only and another is trained based on both the anchor and the

could improve the performance of the anchor restoration; ii) a positive DRI

magnetic energy together with the formation of magnetic flux ropes that
eventually resulted into three homologous eruptive flares of successively
increasing intensities (i.e., M2.0, M2.6, and X1.0). The flares originated from
NOAA active region 12017 during 2014 March 28-29. EUV observations and
magnetogram measurements together with coronal magnetic field modeling suggest
that the flares were triggered by the eruption of flux ropes embedded by a
densely packed system of loops within a small part of the active region. In
X-rays, the first and second events show similar evolution with single, compact
sources, while the third event exhibits multiple emission centroids with a set
of strong non-thermal conjugate sources at 50-100 keV during the HXR peak. The
photospheric magnetic field over an interval of approximately 44 hr
encompassing the three flares undergoes important phases of emergence and
cancellation processes together with significant changes near the polarity
inversion lines within the flaring region. Our observations point toward the
tether-cutting mechanism as the plausible triggering process of the eruptions.
Between the second and third event, we observe a prominent phase of flux
emergence which temporally correlates with the build-up phase of free magnetic
energy in the active region corona. In conclusion, our analysis reveals an
efficient coupling between the rapidly evolving photospheric and coronal
magnetic fields in the active region that led to a continued phase of the
build-up of free energy, resulting into the homologous flares of successively
increasing intensities.

in the Local Volume ($\lesssim 11$ Mpc) to parameterise 19 newly discovered
nuclear star clusters (NSCs). Most of the clusters have stellar masses of
$M_{\star}^{nsc} \lesssim 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ and compare to Galactic globular
clusters in terms of ellipticity, effective radius, stellar mass, and surface
density. The clusters are modelled with a S\'ersic profile and their surface
brightness evaluated at the effective radius reveals a tight positive
correlation to the host galaxy stellar mass. Our data also indicate an increase
in slope of the density profiles with increasing mass, perhaps indicating an
increasing role for in-situ star formation in more massive hosts. We evaluate
the scaling relation between the clusters and their host galaxy stellar mass to
find an environmental dependence: for NSCs in field galaxies, the slope of the
relation is $\alpha = 0.82^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ whereas $\alpha =
0.55^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ for dwarfs in the core of the Virgo cluster. Restricting
the fit for the cluster to $M_{\star}^{gal} \geq 10^{6.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yields
$\alpha = 0.70^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, in agreement with the field environment within
the $1\sigma$ interval. The environmental dependence is due to the lowest-mass
nucleated galaxies and we speculate that this is either due to an increased
number of progenitor globular clusters merging to become an NSC, or due to the
formation of more massive globular clusters in dense environments, depending on
the initial globular cluster mass function. Our results clearly corroborate
recent results in that there exists a tight connection between NSCs and
globular clusters in dwarf galaxies.

study the generation of massive fermions and Z bosons from vacuum in the

geometry of the Weinberg-Salam electro-weak theory for the case of Z boson
interaction with leptons. The probability is found to be a quantity that
depends on the Hubble parameter and we prove that such perturbative processes
are possible only for large expansion regime of the early Universe. The total
probability and rate of transition is obtained for the case of large expansion
and we use the dimensional regularization and Pauli-Villars regularization for
the momenta integrals. In the Minkowski limit we obtain that the probability of
particle generation from vacuum is vanishing recovering the well known result
that forbids particle production in flat space-time due to the momentum-energy

entanglement dynamics if the qubits are directly interacting; this interaction
may even contain a noise term. The present of this additional noise leads to an
additional decoherence term. This decoherence term cannot be removed by
applying the pulses at the same time to both qubits. Rather, we show that by

(RHD) simulations. Toward that end, we adopt physically motivated models for
the magnetic field and particle scattering. By identifying the primary
acceleration process among diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), turbulent shear
acceleration (TSA), and relativistic shear acceleration (RSA), we find that CRs
of $E\lesssim1$ EeV gain energy mainly through DSA in the jet-spine flow and
the backflow containing many shocks and turbulence. After they attain
$E\gtrsim$ a few EeV, CRs are energized mostly via RSA at the jet-backflow
interface, reaching energies well above $10^{20}$ eV. TSA makes a relatively
minor contribution. The time-asymptotic energy spectrum of escaping particles
is primarily governed by the jet power, shifting to higher energies at more
powerful jets. The UHECR spectrum fits well to the double-power-law form, whose
break energy, $E_{\rm break}$, corresponds to the size-limited maximum energy.
It is close to $d\mathcal{N}/dE\propto E^{-0.5}$ below $E_{\rm break}$, while
it follows $d\mathcal{N}/dE\propto E^{-2.6}$ above $E_{\rm break}$, decreasing
more gradually than the exponential. The power-law slope of the high-energy end
is determined by the energy boosts via non-gradual shear acceleration across
the jet-backflow interface and the confinement by the elongated cocoon. We
conclude that giant radio galaxies could be major contributors to the observed
UHECRs.

critical factor for the network to handle important data item. On the other
hand, according to the dilemma in blockchain, an overemphasis on distributed
security will lead to poor transaction-processing capability, which limits the
application of blockchain in data sharing scenarios with high-throughput and
low-latency requirements. To enable demand-oriented distributed services, this
paper investigates the relationship between capability and security in
blockchain from the perspective of block propagation and forking problem.
First, a Markov chain is introduced to analyze the gossiping-based block
propagation among edge servers, which aims to derive block propagation delay
and forking probability. Then, we study the impact of forking on blockchain
capability and security metrics, in terms of transaction throughput,
confirmation delay, fault tolerance, and the probability of malicious
modification. The analytical results show that with the adjustment of block
generation time or block size, transaction throughput improves at the sacrifice
of fault tolerance, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the decline in security can be
offset by adjusting confirmation threshold, at the cost of increasing
confirmation delay. The analysis of capability-security trade-off can provide a
theoretical guideline to manage blockchain performance based on the
requirements of data sharing scenarios.

  Network for Source Camera Model Identification",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Digital security has been an active area of research interest due to the
rapid adaptation of internet infrastructure, the increasing popularity of
social media, and digital cameras. Due to inherent differences in working
principles to generate an image, different camera brands left behind different
intrinsic processing noises which can be used to identify the camera brand. In
the last decade, many signal processing and deep learning-based methods have
been proposed to identify and isolate this noise from the scene details in an
image to detect the source camera brand. One prominent solution is to utilize a
hierarchical classification system rather than the traditional
single-classifier approach. Different individual networks are used for
brand-level and model-level source camera identification. This approach allows
for better scaling and requires minimal modifications for adding a new camera
brand/model to the solution. However, using different full-fledged networks for
both brand and model-level classification substantially increases memory
consumption and training complexity. Moreover, extracted low-level features
from the different network's initial layers often coincide, resulting in
redundant weights. To mitigate the training and memory complexity, we propose a
classifier-block-level hierarchical system instead of a network-level one for
source camera model classification. Our proposed approach not only results in
significantly fewer parameters but also retains the capability to add a new
camera model with minimal modification. Thorough experimentation on the
publicly available Dresden dataset shows that our proposed approach can achieve
the same level of state-of-the-art performance but requires fewer parameters
compared to a state-of-the-art network-level hierarchical-based system.

the spectrum occupied by the Fe XV $n=1-2$ forbidden and intercombination lines

closest to the compact object, and since they are not subject to radiative
transfer effects, we can use them in principle to constrain the radial velocity
amplitude of the compact object. We infer that the results indicate a compact

note that the presence of resonantly scattered radiation from Li-like ions may

coarse-grained fcc-structured Ti1-xAlxN coatings, with 0 \leq x \leq 0.62, the
XANES spectrum changes with Al-content. XANES Ti 1s line-scans across the rake
face of the worn samples reveals that TiN-enriched domains have formed during
turning in Ti0.47Al0.53N and Ti0.38Al0.62N samples as a result of spinodal
decomposition. The XANES spectra reveal the locations on the tool in which the
most TiN-rich domains have formed, indicating which part of the tool-chip
contact area that experienced the highest temperature during turning. Changes
in the pre-edge features in the XANES spectra reveal that structural changes
occur also in the w-TiAlN phase in fine-grained Ti0.38Al0.62N during turning.
EDS shows that Cr and Fe from the steel adhere to the tool rake face during
machining. Cr 1s and Fe 1s XANES show that Cr is oxidized in the end of the
contact length while the adhered Fe retains in the same fcc-structure as that
of the 316L stainless steel.

regularity result for local minimizers $u:\Omega \subset \mathbb R^4

splitting form in four dimensional Euclidean spaces. Under some structural
conditions on the energy density, we prove that each component $u^\alpha$ of

can derive that it is locally bounded and locally H\""older continuous. Our

we consider a degenerate linear elliptic equation of the form $$ -\mbox {div}

virtue of the generalized De Giorgi class, that any weak solution is locally
bounded and locally H\""older continuous provided that $\frac 1 {a(x)}$ and
$F(x)$ belong to some suitable locally integrable function spaces. As a third
application, we show that our theorem can be applied in dealing with regularity
issues of elliptic equations with non-standard grow conditions. As a fourth
application we treat with quasilinear elliptic systems. Under suitable

development has motivated the development and application of bio-mass materials

study is to measure and investigate the performance of a structure-used glued
laminated bamboo (Glubam) and spruce-pine-fir (SPF) as soundproof or
sound-absorbing materials. The impedance tube method was used to measure the
sound reduction index and sound absorption coefficient of glubam and SPF in the
lab. After doing some comparison studies, it can be found that glubam and SPF
have good performance in sound insulation but behave weakly in sound
absorption, and glubam exhibits similar even better acoustic properties than
SPF. Moreover, a finite element model was built up using ABAQUS to predict
sound insulation properties of materials. According to the numerical results of
sound reduction index obtained from the finite element model, developing
composite materials and double-layer panels with cavity between should be
effective on improving the soundproof performance of SPF and glubam.

small-scale ($\sim 1$ AU) changes in spatial and velocity structures of 22 GHz
water masers as observed with VERA before and during the accretion burst. The
masers in the northern bow-shock CM2-W2 brightened, and better traced a bow
structure during the burst. In the southern regions, there was both activation
and disappearance of associations before and during the burst. We measured the
amplitudes, central velocities and FWHMs of about 20 features in each epoch. We
found that the linear scale of the brightest feature in CM2-W2 grew from 0.6 AU
before the burst to 1.4 AU after the burst, possibly indicating that a larger
volume of gas was able to sustain masing action as a consequence of the
accretion burst. This feature also had a rapid (0.2 yr) brightness increase by
a factor of four, which has been previously reported in long-term single-dish
monitoring. We propose that the water maser flare could be explained by an
increase of the collisional pump rate due to radiative heating of H$_2$ by
increased high energy radiation (UV or X-ray) from the inner protostellar core.
We also describe the spot and spectral method of maser proper motion
calculations. We argue that for high spectral resolution observations the
spectral method is more robust for calculating proper motions than the spot

variations with amplitude rising up to $\sim 30$%, when the fastest variability
timescale is found to be a few tens of minutes, giving an emitting region size
of the order $10^{-3}$ pc, which corresponds to $\sim 100$ Schwarzschild radius
of the central black hole, likely coming from some jet mini-structures. Unlike
on intranight timescale, a clear frequency dependent pattern along with
symmetric timescales ($\sim$ 11d) of flux variation are detected on long
timescale. The spectral evolution was predominated by flattening of the spectra
with increasing brightness i.e., a bluer-when-brighter trend in 96% of the
cases. On the night before the outburst peak, the color indices clustered in
two distinct branches in color--magnitude diagram within a period of $\sim$ 6

symmetry-handling inequalities (SHIs) can easily be used to handle original
symmetries, handling sub-symmetries arising later on is more intricate. To
handle sub-symmetries, it has recently been proposed to add SHIs that are

alternative, we propose a new framework for generically activating SHIs,
so-called activation handlers. This framework allows for a direct

the need for auxiliary variables. In particular, activation handlers can
activate symmetry-handling techniques that are more powerful than SHIs. We show

experiments, research for the development of data-driven models for wind-farm
power prediction has increased significantly. While the data-driven models can
successfully predict the power of a wind farm with similar characteristics as
those in the training ensemble, they generally do not have a high degree of
flexibility for extrapolation to unseen cases in contrast to the physics-based
models. In this paper, we focus on data-driven models with improved
interpretability and generalizability levels that can predict the performance
of turbines in wind farms. To prepare the datasets, several cases are defined
based on the layouts of operational wind farms, and massive computational fluid
dynamics simulations are performed. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm is
used afterward to build models, which have turbine-level geometric inputs in
combination with the efficiency from physics-based models as the features.
After training, to analyze the models' capability in generalization, their
predictions for the unseen cases with different operating conditions, inflow
turbulence levels, and wind-farm layouts are compared to the Park model and an
empirical-analytical Gaussian wake model. Results show that the physics-guided
machine-learning models outperform both physics-based models showing a high
degree of generalizability, and the machine is not sensitive to the choice of
the physics-based guide model.

liquids near the glass transition. Its calculation requires the enumeration of
the basins in the potential energy landscape and when available, it reveals a
direct connection with the relaxation time of the liquid. While there are
several reports on the measurement of configurational entropy in passive
liquids, very little is understood about its role in active liquids which have
a propensity to undergo a glass transition at low temperatures. In this paper,
we report a careful calculation of the configurational entropy in a model glass
former where the constituent units are self propelled. We show that unlike
passive liquids, the anharmonic contribution to the glass entropy in these
self-propelled liquids can be of the same order as the harmonic contribution,
and therefore must be included in the calculation of the configurational
entropy. Our extracted configurational entropy is in good agreement with the
generalized Adam-Gibbs relation predicted by the random first order transition
theory enabling us to deduce a scaling relation between the configurational
entropy and the point-to-set length scale in these active systems. Our findings
could be of great utility in conventional active systems such as self-propelled

electromagnetic radiation simulation of electric vehicles, a field measurement
scheme for charging devices is designed. Through the monitoring of wireless
charging equipment, the radiation level and distribution of the electric field
value and magnetic field value around the charging equipment is explored, to
analyze the influence law of the electromagnetic environment. Method This paper
introduces the principle and development status of electric vehicle charging,
and analyzes the classification and methods of wireless charging. In this
paper, the electric field and magnetic field of cars and minibuses are
monitored, at positions such as: around the body, attenuation section, inside
the car and inside the minibus. Result The range of electric field strength is
0.9 V/m to 48.1 V/m for cars, and 0.8 V/m to 74.7 V/m for minibuses. The
electric field strength decays rapidly with the increase of the distance from
the vehicle body, and the law is obvious. The range of magnetic induction
intensity is 0.12{\mu}T-12.70{\mu}T for cars, and 0.15{\mu}T-27.06{\mu}T for
minibuses. The magnetic induction intensity decays rapidly with the increase of

paper explores the radiation level and distribution of the electromagnetic
field around this type of charging equipment. It is recommended that
manufacturers of wireless charging devices for electric vehicles strengthen
research on electromagnetic radiation shielding and take corresponding measures
to control the level of electromagnetic radiation in areas accessible to the

clinical applications by providing deep insights into molecular analysis. The
multilayer cavity's proposed architecture is meant to promote a robust
interaction between light and matter. The top layer was made of silver Ag
multi-shape features that, after being synthesized and characterized, were
immobilized on the surface, while a layer of indium tin oxide ITO was flipped
to produce two distinct layouts. An investigation of the mode behavior was
conducted to describe the two layouts; experimental and numerical results point
to a strong light/matter interaction by the ITO/SiO2/spacer/Ag multi-shape
feature design. For the characterization of the light/matter coupling, a
fluorophore was deposited on the surface; the anticrossing energy was then
examined by integrating the experimental data with a model of three mechanical
oscillators. To show the system's sensitivity, the analysis was carried out
again using bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. The protein is water-soluble
and exhibits an infrared absorption band (amide I), while also being active in
the Raman region. Besides, it may consistently bind to Ag multi-shape features.
The excellent sensitivity was demonstrated, enabling the use of image analysis
to capture the surface-enhanced Raman scattering of the BSA. In conclusion, the
suggested sensing approach brings up fresh possibilities for highly sensitive

fundamental sensing technique to investigate molecular patterns.

powerful vision-language foundation models like CLIP to downstream datasets by
tuning learnable prompt vectors with very few samples. However, although prompt
learning achieves excellent performance over in-domain data, it still faces the
major challenge of generalizing to unseen classes and domains. Some existing
prompt learning methods tackle this issue by adaptively generating different
prompts for different tokens or domains but neglecting the ability of learned
prompts to generalize to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompt learning paradigm that directly generates \emph{domain invariant} prompt
that can be generalized to unseen domains, called MetaPrompt. Specifically, a
dual-modality prompt tuning network is proposed to generate prompts for input
from both image and text modalities. With a novel asymmetric contrastive loss,
the representation from the original pre-trained vision-language model acts as
supervision to enhance the generalization ability of the learned prompt. More
importantly, we propose a meta-learning-based prompt tuning algorithm that
explicitly constrains the task-specific prompt tuned for one domain or class to
also achieve good performance in another domain or class. Extensive experiments
on 11 datasets for base-to-new generalization and 4 datasets for domain
generalization demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly
outperforms existing methods.

  Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2023)",,,,"cs.DM cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying problems
on the transformability between a pair of solutions of a search problem. We
consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration
problems; e.g., for a Boolean formula $\varphi$ and two satisfying truth
assignments $\sigma_{\sf s}$ and $\sigma_{\sf t}$ for $\varphi$, Maxmin SAT
Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses
of $\varphi$ during transformation from $\sigma_{\sf s}$ to $\sigma_{\sf t}$.
Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may obtain a
reconfiguration sequence comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments.
  In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give
evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to
approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new
working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis
(RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of
the PCP theorem. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin
$3$-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof
is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself
of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction
technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis does not
preserve the perfect completeness, we modify the alphabet as if each vertex
could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness
requirement, we further apply an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs and
the expander mixing lemma. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate
that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are
PSPACE-hard to approximate.

significantly affects the decay dynamics of the giant atom as well as the

chiral spontaneous emission and allow for nonreciprocal delayed light, which

LTL can benefit hugely from stutter insensitivity, using a diverse set of
reduction strategies. However properties that are not stutter invariant, for
instance due to the use of the neXt operator of LTL or to some form of counting
in the logic, are not covered by these techniques in general. We propose in
this paper to study a weaker property than stutter insensitivity. In a stutter
insensitive language both adding and removing stutter to a word does not change
its acceptance, any stuttering can be abstracted away; by decomposing this
equivalence relation into two implications we obtain weaker conditions. We
define a shortening insensitive language where any word that stutters less than
a word in the language must also belong to the language. A lengthening
insensitive language has the dual property. A semi-decision procedure is then
introduced to reliably prove shortening insensitive properties or deny
lengthening insensitive properties while working with a \emph{reduction} of a
system. A reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs. Lipton's
transaction reductions or Petri net agglomerations are examples of eligible
structural reduction strategies. We also present an approach that can reason
using a partition of a property language into its stutter insensitive,
shortening insensitive, lengthening insensitive and length sensitive parts to
still use structural reductions even when working with arbitrary properties. An
implementation and experimental evidence is provided showing most non-random
properties sensitive to stutter are actually shortening or lengthening
insensitive.

self-training with pseudo-labeling thresholded by prediction confidence. In a
source-free scenario, only supervision comes from target data, and thresholding
limits the contribution of the self-training. In this study, we utilize
self-training with a mean-teacher approach. The student network is trained with
all predictions of the teacher network. Instead of thresholding the
predictions, the gradients calculated from the pseudo-labels are weighted based
on the reliability of the teacher's predictions. We propose a novel method that

Therefore, the metric network can be updated in training time, which enables
end-to-end training. We also propose a metric-based online ClassMix method to

ICSPatch pinpoints the vulnerability in the control application. As an

associated variables. The proposed solution is to build an autoencoder of their
joint distribution and to maximize its estimation capacity relative to both the
marginal distributions. It is shown that the resulting two capacities cannot,
in general, be equal. This leads to a new criterion for causal discovery: the
higher capacity is consistent with the unconstrained choice of a distribution
representing the cause while the lower capacity reflects the constraints
imposed by the mechanism on the distribution of the effect. Estimation capacity
is defined as the ability of the auto-encoder to represent arbitrary datasets.
A regularization term forces it to decide which one of the variables to model

direction is revealed by the constraints encountered while encoding the data
instead of being measured as a property of the data itself. The idea is
implemented and tested using a restricted Boltzmann machine.

planets. It has been suggested that Jupiter's enriched envelope is a result of
planetesimal accretion during its growth assuming it formed in a massive
planetesimal disk. In this study, we simulate Jupiter's formation in this
scenario. We assume in-situ formation and perform N-body simulations to infer
the solid accretion rate. We find that tens-Earth masses of planetesimals can
be captured by proto-Jupiter during the rapid gas accretion phase. However, if
several embryos are formed near Jupiter's core, which is an expected outcome in
the case of a massive planetesimal disk, scattering from the embryos increases
the eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals and therefore significantly
reduces the accretion efficiency. We also compare our results with published
semi-analytical models and show that these models cannot reproduce the N-body
simulations especially when the planetesimal disk has a large eccentricity and
inclination. We show that when the dynamical evolution of planetesimals is
carefully modelled, the total mass of captured planetesimals
$M_\mathrm{cap,tot}$ is $2 M_\oplus \lesssim M_\mathrm{cap,tot}\lesssim 18
M_\oplus$. The metallicity of Jupiter's envelope can be explained by the
planetesimal accretion in our massive disk model despite the low accretion
efficiency coming from the high eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals.
Our study demonstrates the importance of detailed modelling of planetesimal
accretion during the planetary growth and its implications to the heavy-element
mass in gaseous planets.

probabilistic nature of the diffusion prior, one big advantage of our framework
is it can synthesize diverse facial motion sequences given the same audio clip,

we analyze and model it from the perspective of the generation mechanism of the
coupling disturbance, and derive the dynamics model of the aerial manipulator
system and the coupling disturbance model based on the variable inertia
parameters. Through the proposed coupling disturbance model, we can compensate
the strong coupling disturbance in a way of feedforward. Then, the adaptive
neural network is proposed and applid to estimate and compensate the additional
disturbances, and the closed-loop controller is designed based on the
backstepping control method. Finally, we verify the correctness of the proposed
coupling disturbance model through physical experiment under a large range

prove the accurate estimation of the proposed adaptive neural network for
additional disturbances and the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed

of all, a suitable model of the signal received by the multichannel radar is
developed via a linearization procedure of the Uniform Linear Array (ULA)
manifold around the nominal array looking direction together with the use of
symmetric Toeplitz structured matrices to represent the mutual coupling
effects. Hence, the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) detector is
evaluated under the assumption of homogeneous radar environment. Its
computation leverages a specific Minorization-Maximization (MM) framework, with
proven convergence properties, to optimize the concentrated likelihood function
under the target presence hypothesis. Besides, when the number of active mutual
coupling coefficients is unknown, a Multifamily Likelihood Ratio Test (MFLRT)
approach is invoked. During the analysis phase, the performance of the new
detectors is compared with benchmarks as well as with counterparts available in
the open literature which neglect the mutual coupling phenomenon. The results
indicate that it is necessary to consider judiciously the coupling effect since
the design phase, to guarantee performance levels close to the benchmark.

posterior distribution based upon a Gaussian prior agree with the minimizers of
its Onsager-Machlup functional and thus also with weak posterior modes. We
apply this result to inverse problems and derive conditions on the forward
mapping under which this variational characterization of posterior modes holds.
Our results show rigorously that in the limit case of infinite-dimensional data
corrupted by additive Gaussian or Laplacian noise, nonparametric MAP estimation
is equivalent to Tikhonov-Phillips regularization. In comparison with the work
of Dashti, Law, Stuart, and Voss (2013), the assumptions on the likelihood are
relaxed so that they cover in particular the important case of Gaussian process
noise. We illustrate our results by applying them to a severely ill-posed
linear problem with Laplacian noise, where we express the MAP estimator
analytically and study its rate of convergence.

infer a sequential decision-making policy from expert demonstrations. However,
when the quality of the data is not optimal, the resulting behavioural policy
also performs sub-optimally once deployed. Recently, there has been a surge in
offline reinforcement learning methods that hold the promise to extract
high-quality policies from sub-optimal historical data. A common approach is to
perform regularisation during training, encouraging updates during policy
evaluation and/or policy improvement to stay close to the underlying data. In
this work, we investigate whether an offline approach to improving the quality
of the existing data can lead to improved behavioural policies without any
changes in the BC algorithm. The proposed data improvement approach -
Trajectory Stitching (TS) - generates new trajectories (sequences of states and
actions) by `stitching' pairs of states that were disconnected in the original
data and generating their connecting new action. By construction, these new
transitions are guaranteed to be highly plausible according to probabilistic
models of the environment, and to improve a state-value function. We
demonstrate that the iterative process of replacing old trajectories with new
ones incrementally improves the underlying behavioural policy. Extensive
experimental results show that significant performance gains can be achieved
using TS over BC policies extracted from the original data. Furthermore, using
the D4RL benchmarking suite, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art results are
obtained by combining TS with two existing offline learning methodologies
reliant on BC, model-based offline planning (MBOP) and policy constraint

(SSL) in recommendation systems. However, SSL recommender models are likely to
suffer from spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate
spurious correlations, existing work usually pursues ID-based SSL
recommendation or utilizes feature engineering to identify spurious features.
Nevertheless, ID-based SSL approaches sacrifice the positive impact of
invariant features, while feature engineering methods require high-cost human
labeling. To address the problems, we aim to automatically mitigate the effect

spurious features without supervision, and 2) block the negative effect
transmission from spurious features to other features during SSL. To handle the
two challenges, we propose an invariant feature learning framework, which first
divides user-item interactions into multiple environments with distribution
shifts and then learns a feature mask mechanism to capture invariant features
across environments. Based on the mask mechanism, we can remove the spurious
features for robust predictions and block the negative effect transmission via
mask-guided feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on two datasets

constrain aspects of planet formation that have large uncertainties by matching
key characteristics of the Solar System. The model produces a good fit to these
characteristics for a narrow range of parameter space. Planetary growth beyond
the ice line is dominated by pebble accretion. Planetesimal accretion is more
important inside the ice line. Pebble accretion inside the ice line is slowed
by higher temperatures, partial removal of inflowing pebbles by planetesimal
formation and pebble accretion further out in the disk, and increased radial
velocities due to gas advection. The terrestrial planets are prevented from
accreting much water ice because embryos beyond the ice line reach the pebble
isolation mass before the ice line enters the terrestrial-planet region. When
only pebble accretion is considered, embryos typically remain near their
initial mass or grow to the pebble-isolation mass. Adding planetesimal
accretion allows Mars-sized objects to form inside the ice line, and allows
giant-planet cores to form over a wider region beyond the ice line. In the
region occupied by Mercury, pebble Stokes numbers are small. This delays the
formation of embryos and stunts their growth, so that only low-mass planets can
form here.

extend its use to certain analysis scenarios, particularly those involving a

alternative approaches such as ${\tt matter}$ and ${\tt Levin}$ may be
necessary for a full exploration of parameter space. We also find that the
usual first-order Limber approximation is insufficiently accurate for LSST Year

with a novel derivation from reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, which has a
mode-seeking behavior and is likely to find one of the sub-optimal solutions
early. With this derivation, a weighted maximum likelihood estimation with
positive/negative weights is obtained, solving by mirror descent (MD)
algorithm. While the negative weights eliminate unnecessary actions, that
requires to develop a practical implementation that avoids the interference
with positive/negative updates based on rejection sampling. In addition,
although the convergence of MD can be accelerated with Nesterov's acceleration
method, it is modified for the proposed MPC with a heuristic of a step size
adaptive to the noise estimated in update amounts. In the real-time
simulations, the proposed method can solve more tasks statistically than the
conventional method and accomplish more complex tasks only with a CPU due to
the improved acceleration. In addition, its applicability is also demonstrated
in a variable impedance control of a force-driven mobile robot.

field are crucial for studying the particle acceleration of shocks. The recent
confirmation of the bipolarity of the eROSITA bubbles suggests that the
well-known NPS/Loop I should be a 10--kpc sized relic in the Galactic halo
instead of a small local structure near the Sun. By deriving the energy density
of CRe and magnetic field strength accounting for the NPS, unprecedentedly
precise parameter constraints on particle acceleration for weak shocks in the
halo medium can be provided. The parameters of CRe and magnetic field can be
derived independently by modeling the gamma-ray and the radio data of the NPS
via inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron emission, respectively. Our main
results are: (1), the energy density of CRe is (3-6)$\times 10^{-14}$ erg
cm$^{-3}$, and the spectral index is $p\simeq 2.0\pm 0.1$ below the cooling
break energy of about 5 GeV; (2), the magnetic field strength is 3 $\mu$G; (3),
the shock acceleration efficiency of CRe is close to 1%. Given the Mach number
of 1.5, the high acceleration efficiency and flat spectrum of CRe suggest that
re-acceleration of preexisting relativistic electrons could exist in the NPS.
Alternatively, they could be accelerated by a faster shock in the early epoch,
and transport to the current position with an unusually large perpendicular
diffusion coefficient. In addition, the cooling break energy suggests that the
cooling timescale is $10^7$ yr, in agreement with the age of the eROSITA
bubbles.

high secret key rate (SKR) of 1.27 Mbit/s, while at 504-km standard fiber, we
obtain the repeater-like key rate scaling with a SKR of 34 times higher than

widely exploited to implement image SR, so a new trend is to involve
frequency-domain information in SR tasks. Besides, image SR is typically
application-oriented and various computer vision tasks call for image arbitrary

frequency domain to design a novel scale-arbitrary image SR network. First, we
statistically analyze LR-HR image pairs of several datasets under different

under different scale factors suffer from different degrees of degradation, but
the valid low-frequency spectra tend to be retained within a certain

can accurately and adaptively divide the frequency spectrum into the
low-frequency part to be retained and the high-frequency one to be recovered.
Finally, we design a scale-aware feature recovery module to capture and fuse
multi-level features for reconstructing the high-frequency spectrum at
arbitrary scale factors. Extensive experiments on public datasets show the

skill of biological brains, whereas it represents a major challenge to the
field of deep learning. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, various continual
learning (CL) approaches have been devised. However, these usually require
discrete task boundaries. This requirement seems biologically implausible and
often limits the application of CL methods in the real world where tasks are
not always well defined. Here, we take inspiration from neuroscience, where
sparse, non-overlapping neuronal representations have been suggested to prevent
catastrophic forgetting. As in the brain, we argue that these sparse
representations should be chosen on the basis of feed forward
(stimulus-specific) as well as top-down (context-specific) information. To
implement such selective sparsity, we use a bio-plausible form of hierarchical
credit assignment known as Deep Feedback Control (DFC) and combine it with a
winner-take-all sparsity mechanism. In addition to sparsity, we introduce
lateral recurrent connections within each layer to further protect previously
learned representations. We evaluate the new sparse-recurrent version of DFC on
the split-MNIST computer vision benchmark and show that only the combination of
sparsity and intra-layer recurrent connections improves CL performance with
respect to standard backpropagation. Our method achieves similar performance to
well-known CL methods, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation and Synaptic
Intelligence, without requiring information about task boundaries. Overall, we
showcase the idea of adopting computational principles from the brain to derive
new, task-free learning algorithms for CL.

neural function, and to interface successfully with the brain, neuromorphic
circuits need to encode information in a way compatible to that used by
populations of neuron in the brain. To facilitate the cross-talk between
neuromorphic engineering and neuroscience, in this Review we first critically
examine and summarize emerging recent findings about how population of neurons
encode and transmit information. We examine the effects on encoding and readout
of information for different features of neural population activity, namely the
sparseness of neural representations, the heterogeneity of neural properties,
the correlations among neurons, and the time scales (from short to long) at
which neurons encode information and maintain it consistently over time.
Finally, we critically elaborate on how these facts constrain the design of
information coding in neuromorphic circuits. We focus primarily on the
implications for designing neuromorphic circuits that communicate with the
brain, as in this case it is essential that artificial and biological neurons
use compatible neural codes. However, we also discuss implications for the
design of neuromorphic systems for implementation or emulation of neural

inverse problems. Most normalizing flows for inverse problems in imaging employ
the conditional affine coupling layer that can generate diverse images quickly.
However, unintended severe artifacts are occasionally observed in the output of
them. In this work, we address this critical issue by investigating the origins
of these artifacts and proposing the conditions to avoid them. First of all, we
empirically and theoretically reveal that these problems are caused by
""exploding inverse"" in the conditional affine coupling layer for certain
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditional inputs. Then, we further validated that
the probability of causing erroneous artifacts in pixels is highly correlated
with a Mahalanobis distance-based OOD score for inverse problems in imaging.
Lastly, based on our investigations, we propose a remark to avoid exploding
inverse and then based on it, we suggest a simple remedy that substitutes the
affine coupling layers with the modified rational quadratic spline coupling
layers in normalizing flows, to encourage the robustness of generated image
samples. Our experimental results demonstrated that our suggested methods
effectively suppressed critical artifacts occurring in normalizing flows for
super-resolution space generation and low-light image enhancement.

matter (DM) it is argued that the axion-like self-interaction of ultralight
bosons provides the existence of rarefied and dense phases, which are predicted
earlier on the base of the models with polynomial-like self-interactions.
Associating the very short scattering length in BEC DM with the predominant
participating composites of few DM particles, we attempt to form a dimer of two
particles at a quantum mechanical level, using a smooth $\mu$-deformation of
the axion cosine-like potential and replacing the field-dependent argument with
the distance between particles. Part of the obtained results concerns potential
two-particle scattering with $\mu$-deformed interaction, and they allow us to
focus on a special option with unique values of the deformation parameter
$\mu=1$ and the coupling constant. In this case of the potential with an
infinite scattering length, we get a rather simple solution for the dimer in
the ground state. We involve two-channel scattering and Feshbach resonance to
describe the formation of a dimer in space. Specifying the parameters of
interactions, we reveal a long-lived resonance that occurs when a pair of
particles jumps between the open and closed scattering channels with close
energy values. This indicates the possibility of participation of such dimers
in forming BEC DM halo of galaxies.

serves as an exploratory tool to classify EEG channels into mutually
asymptotically dependent or asymptotically independent groups. It provides
insights into how the brain network organizes itself during an extreme event

image super-resolution (SR) because of its ability to reconstruct
high-resolution images with arbitrary scales from low-resolution inputs.
Existing methods mostly ensemble nearby features to predict the new pixel at
any queried coordinate in the SR image. Such a local ensemble suffers from some
limitations: i) it has no learnable parameters and it neglects the similarity
of the visual features; ii) it has a limited receptive field and cannot
ensemble relevant features in a large field which are important in an image. To
address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous implicit
attention-in-attention network, called CiaoSR. We explicitly design an implicit
attention network to learn the ensemble weights for the nearby local features.
Furthermore, we embed a scale-aware attention in this implicit attention
network to exploit additional non-local information. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate CiaoSR significantly outperforms the existing
single image SR methods with the same backbone. In addition, CiaoSR also
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the arbitrary-scale SR task. The
effectiveness of the method is also demonstrated on the real-world SR setting.
More importantly, CiaoSR can be flexibly integrated into any backbone to
improve the SR performance.

cardiac rhythm corresponding to PPG signals can be used to predict different
tasks such as activity recognition, sleep stage detection, or more general
health status. However, supervised learning is often limited by the amount of
available labeled data, which is typically expensive to obtain. To address this
problem, we propose a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) method with a pretext task
of signal reconstruction to learn an informative generalized PPG
representation. The performance of the proposed SSL framework is compared with
two fully supervised baselines. The results show that in a very limited label
data setting (10 samples per class or less), using SSL is beneficial, and a
simple classifier trained on SSL-learned representations outperforms fully
supervised deep neural networks. However, the results reveal that the
SSL-learned representations are too focused on encoding the subjects.
Unfortunately, there is high inter-subject variability in the SSL-learned
representations, which makes working with this data more challenging when
labeled data is scarce. The high inter-subject variability suggests that there
is still room for improvements in learning representations. In general, the
results suggest that SSL may pave the way for the broader use of machine
learning models on PPG data in label-scarce regimes.

The concept of ""illusionism"", proposing that even the very conscious experience
we have is an illusion, is not only a red-pill scenario found in the 1999
science fiction movie ""The Matrix"" but is also a philosophical concept promoted
by modern tinkers, most prominently by Daniel Dennett. Reflection upon a
possible simulation and our perceived reality was beautifully visualized in
""The Matrix"", bringing the old ideas of Descartes to coffee houses around the
world. Irish philosopher Bishop Berkeley was the father of what was later
coined as ""subjective idealism"", basically stating that ""what you perceive is
real"". With the advent of quantum technologies based on the control of
individual fundamental particles, the question of whether our universe is a
simulation isn't just intriguing. Our ever-advancing understanding of
fundamental physical processes will likely lead us to build quantum computers
utilizing quantum effects for simulating nature quantum-mechanically in all
complexity, as famously envisioned by Richard Feynman. In this article, we
outline constraints on the limits of computability and predictability in/of the

conclusions as to whether we participate in a simulation chain. Eventually, in
a simulation in which the computer simulating a universe is governed by the

network (DNN) based methods have been proposed to address the complex inverse
problem of estimating $T_2$ distributions from MRI data, but they are not yet
robust enough for clinical data with low Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and are
highly sensitive to distribution shifts such as variations in echo-times (TE)
used during acquisition. Consequently, their application is hindered in
clinical practice and large-scale multi-institutional trials with heterogeneous
acquisition protocols. We propose a physically-primed DNN approach, called
$P_2T_2$, that incorporates the signal decay forward model in addition to the
MRI signal into the DNN architecture to improve the accuracy and robustness of
$T_2$ distribution estimation. We evaluated our $P_2T_2$ model in comparison to
both DNN-based methods and classical methods for $T_2$ distribution estimation
using 1D and 2D numerical simulations along with clinical data. Our model
improved the baseline model's accuracy for low SNR levels ($SNR<80$) which are
common in the clinical setting. Further, our model achieved a $\sim$35\%
improvement in robustness against distribution shifts in the acquisition
process compared to previously proposed DNN models. Finally, Our $P_2T_2$ model
produces the most detailed Myelin-Water fraction maps compared to baseline
approaches when applied to real human MRI data. Our $P_2T_2$ model offers a

computer-assisted pronunciation training systems are used to detect learner
mispronunciations. These systems typically compare the user's speech with that
of a specific native speaker as a model in units of rhythm, phonemes, or words
and calculate the differences. However, they require extensive speech data with
detailed annotations or can only compare with one specific native speaker. To
overcome these problems, we propose a new language learning support system that
calculates speech scores and detects mispronunciations by beginners based on a
small amount of unannotated speech data without comparison to a specific

display the pronunciation score of the learner's speech and the
difference/distance between the learner's and a group of models' pronunciation
in an intuitively visual manner. Learners can gradually improve their
pronunciation by eliminating differences and shortening the distance from the
model until they become sufficiently proficient. Furthermore, since the
pronunciation score and difference/distance are not calculated compared to
specific sentences of a particular model, users are free to study the sentences
they wish to study. We also built an application to help non-native speakers
learn English and confirmed that it can improve users' speech intelligibility.

$\tau_n=881.16^{+2.25}_{-2.35}$ s with statistical bootstrap errors, while the
result of median statistics is $\tau_n=881.5^{+5.5}_{-3}$ s according to the
binomial distribution. Using the different central estimates, we also construct
the error distributions of neutron lifetime measurements and find the
non-Gaussianity, which is still meaningful.

Here, we develop a fully automated technique using computer vision on a
microcontroller that will reduce and eliminate level-crossing deaths and
accidents. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller detects impending trains using
computer vision on live video, and the intersection is closed until the
incoming train passes unimpeded. Live video activity recognition and object
detection algorithms scan the junction 24/7. Self-regulating microcontrollers
control the entire process. When persistent unauthorized activity is
identified, authorities, such as police and fire brigade, are notified via
automated messages and notifications. The microcontroller evaluates live
rail-track data, and arrival and departure times to anticipate ETAs, train
position, velocity, and track problems to avoid head-on collisions. This
proposed scheme reduces level crossing accidents and fatalities at a lower cost
than current market solutions.

synthetic data generation as a tool to extrapolate difficult-to-obtain

uses a combination of univariate and multivariate frequency tables from a given
target geographical location in combination with frequency tables from other
auxiliary locations to generate synthetic microdata for individuals in the
target location. Our method combines the estimation of a dependency graph and
conditional probabilities from the target location with the use of a Gaussian
copula to leverage the available information from the auxiliary locations. We
perform extensive testing on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that our
approach outperforms prior approaches in preserving the overall dependency

  Framework for Stock Trend Forecasting","31 pages",,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, machine learning methods have shown the prospects of stock trend
forecasting. However, the volatile and dynamic nature of the stock market makes
it difficult to directly apply machine learning techniques. Previous methods
usually use the temporal information of historical stock price patterns to
predict future stock trends, but the multi-scale temporal dependence of
financial data and stable trading opportunities are still difficult to capture.
The main problem can be ascribed to the challenge of recognizing the patterns
of real profit signals from noisy information. In this paper, we propose a
framework called Multiscale Temporal Memory Learning and Efficient Debiasing
(MTMD). Specifically, through self-similarity, we design a learnable embedding
with external attention as memory block, in order to reduce the noise issues
and enhance the temporal consistency of the model. This framework not only
aggregates comprehensive local information in each timestamp, but also
concentrates the global important historical patterns in the whole time stream.
Meanwhile, we also design the graph network based on global and local
information to adaptively fuse the heterogeneous multi-scale information.
Extensive ablation studies and experiments demonstrate that MTMD outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin on the benchmark
datasets. The source code of our proposed method is available at

Programming for Generalization, which can automatically generate programs by
inductive inference. Because the proposed method can realize ""sequence"",
""selection"", and ""iteration"" in programming and can satisfy the conditions of
the structured program theorem, it is expected that NP4G is a method

automatically construct a bitwise NOT operation program from several training

connects nodes, by adjusting the number of nodes and the number of phase of
""Phased Learning"", we show the bitwise NOT operation programs are acquired in a
comparatively short time and at a rate of about 7 in 10 running. The source

cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are in their infancy and may someday qualify

is its high energy consumption consensus mechanism. The second is the
cryptographic primitives which are unsafe against post-quantum (PQ) attacks. We
aim to propose Green Bitcoin which addresses both issues. To save energy in
consensus mechanism, we introduce a post-quantum secure (self-election)
verifiable coin-toss function and novel PQ secure proof-of-computation
primitives. It is expected to reduce the rate of energy consumption more than
90 percent of the current Bitcoin network. The elliptic curve cryptography will
be replaced with PQ-safe versions. The Green Bitcoin protocol will help Bitcoin

by modifying fixed point actions of 4D Quantum Chromo Dynamics action to (2+1)D
action, replacing Dirac fermions by Weyl fermions, and changing the electric
charge current flow to the energy flow. We consider $A$ type loops whose path
are on a 2D plane, and $B$ type loops which contain two parallel links that
connect two 2D plane on different time slices. The length of loops are
restricted to be less than or equal to 8 lattice units. At the moment spatial
lattice unit and time lattice unit are same. They can be chosen arbitrarily
when one compares hysteresis effects with experimental data. Using the
quaternion expression of Porteous, we calculate the plaquette part of loop
actions and the link part of loop actions. Link actions of $A$ type loops
cancel with each other, but those of $B$ type loops depends on whether the spin
rotation is clockwise or that is counterclockwise. In the present work we
consider average of clockwise rotating and counterclockwise rotating loop
contributions.
