  Continuation Optimization","Published at EMNLP 2022 (Findings)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been extensively used for natural language
understanding (NLU) tasks to improve a small model's (a student) generalization
by transferring the knowledge from a larger model (a teacher). Although KD
methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerous settings, they suffer
from several problems limiting their performance. It is shown in the literature
that the capacity gap between the teacher and the student networks can make KD
ineffective. Additionally, existing KD techniques do not mitigate the noise in
the teacher's output: modeling the noisy behaviour of the teacher can distract
the student from learning more useful features. We propose a new KD method that
addresses these problems and facilitates the training compared to previous
techniques. Inspired by continuation optimization, we design a training
procedure that optimizes the highly non-convex KD objective by starting with
the smoothed version of this objective and making it more complex as the
training proceeds. Our method (Continuation-KD) achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various compact architectures on NLU (GLUE benchmark) and
computer vision tasks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100).

possible gauge theory, a single hermitian matrix integral, in the conventional
't Hooft large $N$ limit. In this first installment of three papers, we propose
and verify an explicit correspondence with a (mirror) pair of closed
topological string theories. On the A-model side, this is a supersymmetric
$SL(2, \mathbb{R})_1/U(1)$ Kazama-Suzuki coset (with background momentum modes
turned on). The mirror B-model description is in terms of a Landau-Ginzburg
theory with superpotential $W(Z)=\frac{1}{Z}+t_2Z$ and its deformations. We
arrive at these duals through an ""open-closed-open triality"". This is the
notion that two open string descriptions ought to exist for the same closed
string theory depending on how closed strings manifest themselves from open
string modes. Applying this idea to the hermitian matrix model gives an exact
mapping to the Imbimbo-Mukhi matrix model. The latter model is known to capture
the physical correlators of the $c=1$ string theory at self-dual radius, which,
in turn, has the equivalent topological string descriptions given above. This
enables us to establish the equality of correlators, to all genus, between
single trace operators in our original matrix model and those of the dual
closed strings. Finally, we comment on how this simplest of dualities might be
fruitfully viewed in terms of an embedding into the full AdS/CFT
correspondence.

  Problem",,,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The unit commitment (UC) problem, which determines operating schedules of
generation units to meet demand, is a fundamental task in power systems
operation. Existing UC methods using mixed-integer programming are not
well-suited to highly stochastic systems. Approaches which more rigorously
account for uncertainty could yield large reductions in operating costs by
reducing spinning reserve requirements; operating power stations at higher
efficiencies; and integrating greater volumes of variable renewables. A
promising approach to solving the UC problem is reinforcement learning (RL), a
methodology for optimal decision-making which has been used to conquer
long-standing grand challenges in artificial intelligence. This thesis explores
the application of RL to the UC problem and addresses challenges including
robustness under uncertainty; generalisability across multiple problem
instances; and scaling to larger power systems than previously studied. To
tackle these issues, we develop guided tree search, a novel methodology
combining model-free RL and model-based planning. The UC problem is formalised
as a Markov decision process and we develop an open-source environment based on
real data from Great Britain's power system to train RL agents. In problems of
up to 100 generators, guided tree search is shown to be competitive with
deterministic UC methods, reducing operating costs by up to 1.4\%. An advantage
of RL is that the framework can be easily extended to incorporate
considerations important to power systems operators such as robustness to
generator failure, wind curtailment or carbon prices. When generator outages
are considered, guided tree search saves over 2\% in operating costs as
compared with methods using conventional $N-x$ reserve criteria.

generic linguistic knowledge brought by pre-trained language models. In this

its value and limitation in modeling word semantics under seed guidance, but
combining three types of contexts (i.e., word embeddings learned from local
contexts, pre-trained language model representations obtained from
general-domain training, and topic-indicative sentences retrieved based on seed

topics. We propose an iterative framework, SeedTopicMine, which jointly learns

an ensemble ranking process. Under various sets of seeds and on multiple

invariant relative to the L\'evy shifts of the sample paths. We answer to the
affirmative Tsirelson's question, whether or not there are any others, and
develop some general theory for such sets. An extra ingredient to their

akin to the Wiener-Hopf factorization of the Brownian motion at the minimum (or

vertices of $T$ such that every vertex is incident to at most $k$ backward arcs

acyclic if and only if its degreewidth is zero.
  Additionally, the class of sparse tournaments defined by Bessy et al. [ESA

  We first study computational complexity of finding degreewidth. Namely, we

vision systems to solve object recognition. Furthermore, CNNs have major
applications in understanding the nature of visual representations in the human
brain. Yet it remains poorly understood how CNNs actually make their decisions,
what the nature of their internal representations is, and how their recognition
strategies differ from humans. Specifically, there is a major debate about the
question of whether CNNs primarily rely on surface regularities of objects, or
whether they are capable of exploiting the spatial arrangement of features,
similar to humans. Here, we develop a novel feature-scrambling approach to
explicitly test whether CNNs use the spatial arrangement of features (i.e.
object parts) to classify objects. We combine this approach with a systematic
manipulation of effective receptive field sizes of CNNs as well as minimal
recognizable configurations (MIRCs) analysis. In contrast to much previous
literature, we provide evidence that CNNs are in fact capable of using
relatively long-range spatial relationships for object classification.
Moreover, the extent to which CNNs use spatial relationships depends heavily on
the dataset, e.g. texture vs. sketch. In fact, CNNs even use different
strategies for different classes within heterogeneous datasets (ImageNet),
suggesting CNNs have a continuous spectrum of classification strategies.
Finally, we show that CNNs learn the spatial arrangement of features only up to
an intermediate level of granularity, which suggests that intermediate rather
than global shape features provide the optimal trade-off between sensitivity
and specificity in object classification. These results provide novel insights
into the nature of CNN representations and the extent to which they rely on the
spatial arrangement of features for object classification.

uses the reconstruction error to determine the novelty of the video since
unknown classes are harder to put back together and thus have a higher
reconstruction error than videos from known classes. We refer to our solution
to the open set action recognition problem as ""Humpty Dumpty"", due to its

accounts for contextual and semantic relations among the clip pieces for
improved reconstruction. A larger reconstruction error leads to an increased

Dumpty back together again, indicating that the action has never been seen

${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter
$r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/(2|{\bf E}|)$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that
critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviours like
coherence--decoherence oscillations when analysed in an appropriately defined
co-decaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector ${\bf
b}$ describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal
intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. These phenomena
emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference
of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these
new features will persist even for quasi-critical scenarios, in which the
vectors ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$ are not perfectly orthogonal to each other.
Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable

previous direct searches in interferometer experiments by more than four orders

templates to produce infrared spectra. Our results show that a
physically-motivated attenuation model is better for obtaining a consistent
multi-wavelength description of galaxy formation and evolution, compared to
using a constant attenuation. We compare our predictions with a compilation of
observations and find that the fiducial model is in reasonable agreement with:
(i) the observed $z=0$ luminosity functions from the far-ultraviolet to
far-infrared simultaneously, and hence (ii) the local cosmic SED in the same

agreement with other independent analyses of stellar density distribution, and

somewhat similar to the inexact oracle proposed recently by
Devolder-Glineur-Nesterov. The proposed approach makes it possible to extend
the class of applicability of subgradient methods with the Polyak step-size, to
the situation of inexact information about the value of the minimum, as well as
the unknown Lipschitz constant of the objective function. Moreover, the use of
local analogs of the global characteristics of the objective function makes it
possible to apply the results of this type to wider classes of problems. We
show the possibility of applying the proposed approach to strongly convex
non-smooth problems, also, we make an experimental comparison with the known
optimal subgradient method for such a class of problems. Moreover, there were
obtained some results connected to the applicability of the proposed technique
to some types of problems with convexity relaxations: the recently proposed
notion of weak $\beta$-quasi-convexity and ordinary quasi-convexity. Also in
the paper, we study a generalization of the described technique to the
situation with the assumption that the $\delta$-subgradient of the objective
function is available instead of the usual subgradient. For one of the
considered methods, conditions are found under which, in practice, it is
possible to escape the projection of the considered iterative sequence onto the
feasible set of the problem.

about the single-particle structure of nuclei from the valley of stability to
the driplines. The interpretation of knockout data relies on reaction models,
where the uncertainties are typically not accounted for. In this work we
quantify uncertainties of optical potentials used in these reaction models and
propagate them, for the first time, to knockout observables using a Bayesian
analysis. We study two reactions in the present paper, the first of which
involves a loosely-bound halo projectile, $^{11}$Be, and the second a
tightly-bound projectile, $^{12}$C. We first quantify the parametric
uncertainties associated with phenomenological optical potentials.
Complementing to this approach, we also quantify the model uncertainties
associated with the chiral forces that can be used to construct microscopic
optical potentials. For the phenomenological study, we investigate the impact
of the imaginary terms of the optical potential on the breakup and stripping
components of the knockout cross sections as well as the impact of the angular
range. For the $^{11}$Be case, the theoretical uncertainty from the
phenomenological method is on the order of the experiment uncertainty on the
knockout observables; however, for the $^{12}$C case, the theoretical
uncertainty is significantly larger. The widths of the confidence intervals for
the knockout observables obtained for the microscopic study and the
phenomenological approach are of similar order of magnitude. Based on this work
we conclude that structure information inferred from the ratio of the knockout
cross sections, will carry a theoretical uncertainty of at least $20\%$ for
halo nuclei and at least $40\%$ for tightly-bound nuclei.

deformable image registration. As a diffeomorphic transformation should have
positive Jacobian determinant |J| everywhere, the number of voxels with |J|<0
has been used to test for diffeomorphism and also to measure the irregularity
of the transformation. For digital transformations, |J| is commonly
approximated using a central difference, but this strategy can yield positive
|J|'s for transformations that are clearly not diffeomorphic -- even at the
voxel resolution level. To show this, we first investigate the geometric
meaning of different finite difference approximations of |J|. We show that to
determine if a deformation is diffeomorphic for digital images, the use of any
individual finite difference approximation of |J| is insufficient. We further
demonstrate that for a 2D transformation, four unique finite difference
approximations of |J|'s must be positive to ensure that the entire domain is
invertible and free of folding at the pixel level. For a 3D transformation, ten
unique finite differences approximations of |J|'s are required to be positive.
Our proposed digital diffeomorphism criteria solves several errors inherent in
the central difference approximation of |J| and accurately detects
non-diffeomorphic digital transformations. The source code of this work is

threshold frequency $\omega_r$ in the subsonic regime, below which the

Hawking modes in the exterior of the horizon of the subsonic region
significantly deviates from that of the gapless cases near the threshold
frequency due to the modified graybody factor, which vanishes as the mode
frequency is below $\omega_r$.

imaging. This often causes undesired contrast variations in the acquired images
due to differences in hardware and acquisition parameters. In recent years,
image synthesis-based MR harmonization with disentanglement has been proposed
to compensate for the undesired contrast variations. Despite the success of
existing methods, we argue that three major improvements can be made. First,
most existing methods are built upon the assumption that multi-contrast MR
images of the same subject share the same anatomy. This assumption is
questionable, since different MR contrasts are specialized to highlight
different anatomical features. Second, these methods often require a fixed set
of MR contrasts for training (e.g., both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images),
limiting their applicability. Lastly, existing methods are generally sensitive
to imaging artifacts. In this paper, we present Harmonization with
Attention-based Contrast, Anatomy, and Artifact Awareness (HACA3), a novel
approach to address these three issues. HACA3 incorporates an anatomy fusion
module that accounts for the inherent anatomical differences between MR
contrasts. Furthermore, HACA3 is also robust to imaging artifacts and can be
trained and applied to any set of MR contrasts. HACA3 is developed and
evaluated on diverse MR datasets acquired from 21 sites with varying field
strengths, scanner platforms, and acquisition protocols. Experiments show that
HACA3 achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple image quality
metrics. We also demonstrate the applicability and versatility of HACA3 on
downstream tasks including white matter lesion segmentation and longitudinal
volumetric analyses.

genuine photon-number correlations between modes in terms of cumulants. We show
that when a uniformly lossy interferometer is fed in every input with identical
single-mode Gaussian states with zero displacement, all the odd-order cumulants
but the first one are zero. Finally, we employ the expressions we derive to
study the distribution of cumulants up to the fourth order for different input
states in a Gaussian boson sampling setup where $K$ identical states are fed
into an $\ell$-mode interferometer. We analyze the dependence of the cumulants
as a function of the type of state, squeezed, lossy squeezed, squashed, or

equation are given to obtain the transmission and reflection probabilities. The
Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism has been implemented in a developed computer
program to compute the conductance in terms of different scattering parameters.
The transport properties of silicene field-effect transistors can be
manipulated by a rectangular barrier. In particular, it is found that the
transmission probability is very sensitive to the barrier height and incident
energy. The results show the occurrence of Klein tunneling and resonant
tunneling, which strongly depend on the barrier width. A rectangular potential
barrier significantly enhances the Klein tunneling effect of Dirac electrons.
In fact, the perfect transmission can occur at a variety of oblique incidence
angles and is not just restricted to normal incidence. Besides, the
transmission profile shows a much more fragmented structure with increasing
barrier width, as occurred in Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonances. On the other hand,
the conductance exhibits a non-monotonic Fermi energy dependence and oscillates
rapidly with increasing barrier height. However, at a fixed value of barrier
height, there is almost no difference among the conductance profiles for a high
Fermi energy value. When the Fermi energy and the barrier height are equal, the
conductance drops to a local minimum. For a thin barrier, the conductance is
significantly reduced, unlike its oscillating behavior for a thicker one. Our
findings demonstrate the development of silicene field-effect transistors and
offer a fresh perspective on the relativistic uses of tunneling in silicene.

Galaxy is valuable from the perspective of observations targeting signals of
cosmological origin, as well as for understanding physical processes in our
Galaxy. In this work we extend the analysis of arXiv:2104.00419v2 [astro.ph]
to: (a) all-sky observed maps at different frequencies provided by WMAP, Planck
and Stockert-Villa, (b) component separated synchrotron maps provided by WMAP,
Planck and BeyondPlanck, and (c) component separated polarization maps provided
by WMAP and Planck. Our main goals are to understand the variation of
morphological properties with frequency, test the agreement between different
component separation pipelines, and understand the nature of non-Gaussianity
and statistical isotropy of synchrotron fluctuations towards smaller scales.
The tools we use are Minkowski functionals and tensors. We find that the
frequency maps exhibit large variation of the morphological features which
persist after smoothing the maps at different scales. These differences are
most likely due to the presence of different foreground components, besides
synchrotron. For the component separated synchrotron temperature maps, we find
that towards small scales BeyondPlanck and WMAP MCMC-e maps exhibit relatively
good agreement with the Haslam map. We also find that all maps exhibit
kurtosis-type non-Gaussianity in agreement with the Haslam map. However, the
levels of deviations are much higher except for WMAP MCMC-e and BeyondPlanck
which are comparable. We also find that the component separated maps tend
towards isotropy on smaller scales, except for Planck and WMAP MCMC-c and -g
maps. The smaller scale non-Gaussian deviations of $E$ and $B$-mode
polarization maps from WMAP and Planck are found to agree well with the
kurtosis type non-Gaussianity.

seismic sequences and underpins Operational Earthquake Forecasting (OEF).
However, it remains challenging to assess the reliability of inverted ETAS
parameters for a range of reasons. The most common algorithms just return point
estimates with little quantification of uncertainty, and Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo implementations remain slow to run, do not scale well and few have
been extended to include spatial structure. Here we present a new approach to
ETAS modelling using an alternative Bayesian method, the Integrated Nested
Laplace Approximation (INLA). We have implemented this model in a new R-Package
called ETAS.inlabru, which builds on the R packages R-INLA and inlabru . Whilst
we just present the temporal component here, the model scales to a
spatio-temporal model and may include a variety of spatial covariates. Using a
series of synthetic case studies, we explore the robustness of our ETAS
inversion method. We demonstrate that reliable estimates of the model
parameters require that the catalogue data contains periods of relative
quiescence as well as triggered sequences. We explore the robustness under
stochastic uncertainty in the training data and show that the method is robust
to a wide range of starting conditions. We show how the inclusion of historic
earthquakes prior to the modelled domain affects the quality of the inversion.
Finally, we show that rate dependent incompleteness after large earthquakes has
a significant and detrimental effect on the ETAS posteriors. We believe that
the speed of the inlabru inversion, which include a rigorous estimation of
uncertainty, will enable a deeper exploration of how to use ETAS robustly for
seismicity modelling and operational earthquake forecasting.

assuming no-bouncing at impact, the motion of the relevant two degrees of
freedom system is reduced to that of a single degree governed by a
piecewise-smooth differential equation. The metainterface dynamics has strong
similarities with the rocking motion of rigid blocks and displays several types
of dynamic bifurcations in the presence of oscillatory forces, including period
doubling, branch point cycle, grazing, as well as quasi-periodic and chaotic
responses. Moreover, the multistable response is found to be broaden to
conditions representative of monostable states within a quasi-static setting,
disclosing a multistability anticipation by dynamics. The wide landscape of the
dynamic response for the buckling based metainterface provides a novel
theoretical framework to be exploited in the design of mechanical devices for

introducing constraints at inference time, we can shift the burden of
robustness from training to the inference algorithm, thereby allowing the model
to adjust dynamically to each individual image's unique and potentially novel
characteristics at inference time. Among different constraints, we find that
equivariance-based constraints are most effective, because they allow dense
constraints in the feature space without overly constraining the representation
at a fine-grained level. Our theoretical results validate the importance of
having such dense constraints at inference time. Our empirical experiments show
that restoring feature equivariance at inference time defends against
worst-case adversarial perturbations. The method obtains improved adversarial

present-day GW spectrum. We use both the WKB estimate, which provides an
analytical description but fails at superhorizon scales, and numerical
simulations that allow us to go beyond the WKB approximation. We show that a
constant $\alpha_{\rm T}$ makes relatively insignificant changes to the GR
solution, especially taking into account the constraints on its value from GW
observations by the LIGO--Virgo collaboration, while $\alpha_{\rm M}$ can
introduce modifications to the spectral slopes of the GW energy spectrum in the
low-frequency regime depending on the considered time evolution of $\alpha_{\rm

at all scales that can be predicted by the WKB approximation. In light of the
recent observations by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations and future

combined effects of the two, unless the signal is observed at different ranges

We use the random character of the spin network to exploit replica and random
average techniques to derive the typical R\'enyi negativty via a classical
generalised Ising model correspondence, generally used for random tensor
networks in the large bond regime. For trivially correlated random spin network
states, with only local entanglement between spins located on the network
edges, we find that typical log negativity displays a holographic character, in
agreement with the results for random tensor networks, in large spin limit.
When non-local bulk entanglement between intertwiners at the vertices is
considered the negativity increases, while at the same time the holographic
scaling is generally perturbed by the bulk contribution.

cosmological constant that is radiatively stable and technically natural. Such
a formulation is fundamentally based on a quantum spacetime, but in an
effective spacetime description of this general formulation of string theory,
the curvature of the dual spacetime is the cosmological constant of the
observed spacetime, while the size of the dual spacetime is the gravitational
constant of the same observed spacetime. Also, the three scales associated with
intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory, the cosmological constant scale
and the Planck scale, as well as the Higgs scale, can be arranged to satisfy
various seesaw-like formulae. Along the way, we show that these new features of

range of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level,
given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the
sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these
models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of
downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between
the language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to
obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific
tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which
may still require ad-hoc interaction.
  Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP).
LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive
combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows
constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy
adaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providing
high-level semantics.
  To enable LMP, we implement LMQL(short for Language Model Query Language),
which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate
an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls
to the underlying language model.
  We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting
methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are
challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows
that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also
significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case

multiple channels remains a substantial challenge. This kind of open quantum
system arises when considering the radiationless decay of excited states that

strategy in the interaction picture to study systems linearly coupled to a
harmonic bath through multiple interaction channels. In the interaction
picture, the bare bath Hamiltonian is removed by a unitary transformation (the
system-bath interactions remain), and a chain mapping transforms the bath modes
to a new basis. The transformed Hamiltonian contains time-dependent local
system-bath couplings. The open quantum system is coupled to a limited number
of (transformed) bath modes in the new basis. As such, the entanglement
generated by the system-bath interactions is local, making efficient dynamical
simulations possible with matrix product states. We use this approach to
simulate singlet fission, using a generalized spin-boson Hamiltonian. The
electronic states are coupled to a vibrational bath both diagonally and
off-diagonally. This approach generalizes the chain mapping scheme to the case
of multi-channel system-bath couplings, enabling the efficient simulation of

remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy. The analysis of its spectral features with the
help of low frequency observations plays an important role for understanding
the evolution of the radio source through the propagation of synchrotron
emission to observers through the SNR environment and the interstellar medium.
Aims. In this paper we present measurements of the integrated spectrum of Cas A
to characterize the properties of free-free absorption towards this SNR. We
also add new measurements to track its slowly evolving and decreasing
integrated flux density. Methods. We use the Giant Ukrainian radio telescope
(GURT) for measuring the continuum spectrum of Cassiopeia A within the
frequency range of 16-72 MHz. The radio flux density of Cassiopeia A relative
to the reference source of the radio galaxy Cygnus A has been measured on
May-October, 2019 with two subarrays of the GURT, used as a two-element
correlation interferometer. Results. We determine magnitudes of emission
measure, electron temperature and an average number of charges of the ions for
both internal and external absorbing ionized gas towards in Cassiopeia A.
Generally, their values are close to the ones suggested by Arias et al. (2018),
although for some there are slight differences. In the absence of clumping we
find the unshocked ejecta of M = 2.61 solar mass at the electron density of
15.3 cm^-3 has a gas temperature of T=100 K. If the clumping factor is 0.67,
then the unshocked ejecta of 0.96 solar mass the electron density of 18.7

obtained with the GURT interferometric observations is consistent with the
theoretical model within measurement errors and also reasonably consistent with
other recent results in the literature.

mitigate the computation and wireless communication overhead of federated
learning. It splits a machine learning model into a device-side model and a
server-side model at a cut layer. Devices only train their allocated model and
transmit the activations of the cut layer to the server. However, SL can lead
to data leakage as the server can reconstruct the input data using the
correlation between the input and intermediate activations. Although allocating
more layers to a device-side model can reduce the possibility of data leakage,
this will lead to more energy consumption for resource-constrained devices and
more training time for the server. Moreover, non-iid datasets across devices
will reduce the convergence rate leading to increased training time. In this
paper, a new personalized SL framework is proposed. For this framework, a novel
approach for choosing the cut layer that can optimize the tradeoff between the
energy consumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time,
and data privacy is developed. In the considered framework, each device
personalizes its device-side model to mitigate non-iid datasets while sharing
the same server-side model for generalization. To balance the energy
consumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time, and data
privacy, a multiplayer bargaining problem is formulated to find the optimal cut
layer between devices and the server. To solve the problem, the
Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) is obtained using the bisection
method with the feasibility test. Simulation results show that the proposed
personalized SL framework with the cut layer from the KSBS can achieve the
optimal sum utilities by balancing the energy consumption, training time, and
data privacy, and it is also robust to non-iid datasets.

a well-known technique that aims to improve cluster identification by first
reducing the dimension. However, the usual approach using principal component
analysis (PCA) has been criticized for focusing only on inertia so that the
first components do not necessarily retain the structure of interest for
clustering. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new tandem clustering
approach based on invariant coordinate selection (ICS). By jointly
diagonalizing two scatter matrices, ICS is designed to find structure in the
data while returning affine invariant components. Some theoretical results have
already been derived and guarantee that under some elliptical mixture models,
the structure of the data can be highlighted on a subset of the first and/or
last components. Nevertheless, ICS has received little attention in a
clustering context. Two challenges are the choice of the pair of scatter
matrices and the selection of the components to retain. For clustering
purposes, we demonstrate that the best scatter pairs consist of one scatter
matrix that captures the within-cluster structure and another that captures the
global structure. For the former, local shape or pairwise scatters are of great
interest, as is the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator based on a
carefully selected subset size that is smaller than usual. We evaluate the
performance of ICS as a dimension reduction method in terms of preserving the
cluster structure present in data. In an extensive simulation study and in
empirical applications with benchmark data sets, we compare different
combinations of scatter matrices, component selection criteria, and the impact
of outliers. Overall, the new approach of tandem clustering with ICS shows
promising results and clearly outperforms the approach with PCA.

creation to dark matter/dark energy today is presented. To start with, a model
of the inflationary phase of the inflaton is introduced. The inflaton rolls
down a hilltop potential along with matter creation being dragged down by the
presence of matter. Presence of matter provides a mechanism to stop universe's
acceleration and hence the inflationary phase. The model predictions for the
standard metrics are fully consistent with the current CMB limits. The
potential could in principle be extended to complete a potential hill
subsequent to inflation. The evolution of the inflaton from the inflationary
phase to radiation/matter dominated eras and to current times can be inferred
qualitatively following the evolution of its equation of state parameter.
Existence of solutions to its dynamics, tracking matter as it evolves to
current times, provides a plausible reasoning for the relative order of

the percentage of program codes executed by a test suite. Despite its
popularity, code coverage has several limitations. One of the major limitations
is that it does not provide any insights into the quality or quantity of test
oracles, a core component of testing. Due to this limitation, several studies
have suggested that coverage is a poor test adequacy metric; therefore, it
should not be used as an indicator of a test suite's fault detection
effectiveness. To address this limitation, researchers have proposed extensions
to traditional structural code coverage to explicitly consider the quality of
test oracles. We refer to these extensions as oracle-based code coverage. This
survey paper studies oracle-based coverage techniques published since their
inception in 2007. We discuss each metric's definition, methodology,
experimental studies, and research findings. Even though oracle-based coverage
metrics are proven to be more effective than traditional coverage in detecting
faults, they have received little attention in the software engineering
community. We present all existing oracle-based adequacy metrics in this paper
and compare the critical features against each other. We observe that different
oracle-based adequacy metrics operate on different coverage domains and use
diverse underlying analysis techniques, enabling a software tester to choose
the appropriate metric based on the testing requirements. Our paper provides
valuable information regarding the limitations of oracle-based methods,
addressing which may help their broader adoption in software testing
automation.

walls in between (underdensity) voids and (overdensity) halo structures. The
(spherical) domain walls exert a repulsive force on a test mass outside of the
wall while a test mass inside of the wall sees no force. This makes the
structures outside the voids go further to a larger radius. Effectively, this
means the voids are becoming larger in this scenario in comparison to the
standard model of cosmology. Interestingly, this makes voids emptier which may
shed light on Peebles' void phenomenon.

plane induced by the Cu substitution can alter the balance between competing
electronic phases of FeSe at high pressures. In the absence of an applied

suppressed by a similar factor. On the other hand, at high pressures, above 10

in transport associated to a magnetic phase in zero-magnetic field. However, by
applying a magnetic field, the resistivity displays an anomaly preceding the
activated behaviour in temperature, assigned to a magnetic anomaly. We find
that the high-pressure superconducting phase of FeSe is robust and remains
enhanced in the presence of Cu impurity, whereas the magnetic phase is not.
This could suggest that high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity has a
sign-preserving order parameter in a presence of a rather glassy magnetic

increase the datasets by including all possible skin lesions, though this would
always leave out some classes. Instead, we evaluate Siamese Neural Networks
(SNNs), which not only allows us to classify images of skin lesions, but also
allow us to identify those images which are different from the trained classes
- allowing us to determine that an image is not an example of our training
classes. We evaluate SNNs on both dermoscopic and clinical images of skin

another, become mutually bound as a BH binary system through interaction with
the gas in the disc and subsequently inspiral through gravitational torques
induced by the local gas until merger. To more precisely determine the
feasibility of this merger pathway, we present the first 3D global hydrodynamic
simulations of both the formation and evolution of a stellar-mass BH binaries
AGN discs with three different AGN disc masses and five different initial
radial separations. These 15 different simulations show that binary capture can
be successful in a range of local gas densities including cases well below that
of a standard radiatively efficient alpha disc, and identify that the majority
of these captured binaries are then subsequently hardened by the surrounding
gas. Both prograde and retrograde binaries are formed in our simulations, which
tend to be slowly hardened by the gas. The eccentricity evolution is found to
depend strongly on the orbital rotation of the binary where prograde binaries
are governed by gravitational torques form their circumbinary mini-disc, with
eccentricities being damped over time, while for retrograde binaries the
eccentricities are excited to >0.9 by accretion torques. In two cases,
retrograde binaries ultimately undergo a close periapsis passage which results
in a merger via gravitational waves after only a few thousand binary orbits.
Thus, the merger timescale for retrograde binaries can be far shorter than the
lifetime of an AGN disc. These simulations support the case that the AGN merger
pathway could be highly efficient for merging BHs.

multiple 2D feature maps and rolls out these maps into a single 2D feature
plane within which we perform 3D-aware diffusion. The Rodin model brings the
much-needed computational efficiency while preserving the integrity of
diffusion in 3D by using 3D-aware convolution that attends to projected
features in the 2D feature plane according to their original relationship in

further enhance details. The 3D avatars generated by our model compare
favorably with those produced by existing generative techniques. We can

using one-to-one bipartite matching during training and enables end-to-end
object detection. Recently, these models have surpassed traditional detectors
on COCO with undeniable elegance. However, they differ from traditional
detectors in multiple designs, including model architecture and training
schedules, and thus the effectiveness of one-to-one matching is not fully
understood. In this work, we conduct a strict comparison between the one-to-one
Hungarian matching in DETRs and the one-to-many label assignments in
traditional detectors with non-maximum supervision (NMS). Surprisingly, we
observe one-to-many assignments with NMS consistently outperform standard
one-to-one matching under the same setting, with a significant gain of up to
2.5 mAP. Our detector that trains Deformable-DETR with traditional IoU-based
label assignment achieved 50.2 COCO mAP within 12 epochs (1x schedule) with
ResNet50 backbone, outperforming all existing traditional or transformer-based
detectors in this setting. On multiple datasets, schedules, and architectures,
we consistently show bipartite matching is unnecessary for performant detection
transformers. Furthermore, we attribute the success of detection transformers
to their expressive transformer architecture. Code is available at

detection of abnormalities such as bearing faults (up to 51% of motor failures
are attributed to bearing faults). Despite numerous methodologies proposed for
bearing fault detection, most of them require normal (healthy) and abnormal
(faulty) data for training. Even with the recent deep learning (DL)
methodologies trained on the labeled data from the same machine, the
classification accuracy significantly deteriorates when one or few conditions
are altered. Furthermore, their performance suffers significantly or may
entirely fail when they are tested on another machine with entirely different
healthy and faulty signal patterns. To address this need, in this pilot study,
we propose a zero-shot bearing fault detection method that can detect any fault
on a new (target) machine regardless of the working conditions, sensor
parameters, or fault characteristics. To accomplish this objective, a 1D
Operational Generative Adversarial Network (Op-GAN) first characterizes the
transition between normal and fault vibration signals of (a) source machine(s)
under various conditions, sensor parameters, and fault types. Then for a target
machine, the potential faulty signals can be generated, and over its actual
healthy and synthesized faulty signals, a compact, and lightweight 1D Self-ONN
fault detector can then be trained to detect the real faulty condition in real
time whenever it occurs. To validate the proposed approach, a new benchmark
dataset is created using two different motors working under different
conditions and sensor locations. Experimental results demonstrate that this
novel approach can accurately detect any bearing fault achieving an average
recall rate of around 89% and 95% on two target machines regardless of its

between two events is \emph{additive}. When considering quantum fluctuations in
the metric or a quantum or statistical superposition of different spacetimes,
additivity is generically lost at the level of expectation values. In the
presence of a superposition of metrics, distances can be made diffeomorphism
invariant by considering the frame of a family of free-falling observers or a
pressureless fluid, provided we work at sufficiently low energies. We propose
to use the average squared distance between two events $\langle
d^2(x,y)\rangle$ as a proxy for understanding the effective quantum (or
statistical) geometry and the emergent causal relations among such observers.
At each point, the average squared distance $\langle d^2(x,y)\rangle$ defines
an average metric tensor. However, due to non-additivity, $\langle
d^2(x,y)\rangle$ is not the (squared) geodesic distance associated with it. We
show that departures from additivity can be conveniently captured by a bi-local
quantity $C(x,y)$. Violations of additivity build up with the mutual separation
between $x$ and $y$ and can correspond to $C<0$ (subadditive) or $C>0$
(superadditive). We show that average Euclidean distances are always
subadditive: they satisfy the triangle inequality but generally fail to
saturate it. In Lorentzian signature there is no definite result about the sign
of $C$, most physical examples give $C<0$ but there exist counterexamples. The
causality induced by subadditive Lorentzian distances is unorthodox but not
pathological. Superadditivity violates the transitivity of causal relations. On
these bases, we argue that subadditive distances are the expected outcome of
dynamical evolution, if relatively generic physical initial conditions are
considered.

considered the SGWB produced by two astrophysical sources: merging compact

through multiple mergers of stellar remnants. We find that measuring the
angular power spectrum of the SGWB anisotropies is almost unattainable.
However, it turns out that it could be possible to probe the SGWB anisotropies
through cross-correlation with the CMB fluctuations. In particular, we find
that a constellation of two LISA-like detectors and CMB-S4 can marginally
constrain the cross-correlation between the CMB lensing convergence and the

DECIGO can probe the cross-correlation between the CMB lensing and the SGWB

Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to detect sufficient EMRIs to
probe the underlying source population, testing theories of the formation and
evolution of MBHs and their environments. Population studies are subject to
selection effects that vary across the EMRI parameter space, which bias
inference results if unaccounted for. This bias can be corrected, but
evaluating the detectability of many EMRI signals is computationally expensive.
We mitigate this cost by (i) constructing a rapid and accurate neural network
interpolator capable of predicting the signal-to-noise ratio of an EMRI from
its parameters, and (ii) further accelerating detectability estimation with a
neural network that learns the selection function, leveraging our first neural
network for data generation. The resulting framework rapidly estimates the
selection function, enabling a full treatment of EMRI detectability in
population inference analyses. We apply our method to an astrophysically
motivated EMRI population model, demonstrating the potential selection biases
and subsequently correcting for them. Accounting for selection effects, we
predict that LISA will measure the MBH mass function slope to a precision of
8.8%, the CO mass function slope to a precision of 4.6%, the width of the MBH

designs where individual quantum processors, called nodes, are linked together
to form one large multinode quantum computer (MNQC). One scalable method to
construct an MNQC is using superconducting quantum systems with optical
interconnects. However, a limiting factor of these machines will be internode
gates, which may be two to three orders of magnitude noisier and slower than
local operations. Surmounting the limitations of internode gates will require a
range of techniques, including improvements in entanglement generation, the use
of entanglement distillation, and optimized software and compilers, and it
remains unclear how improvements to these components interact to affect overall
system performance, what performance from each is required, or even how to
quantify the performance of each. In this paper, we employ a `co-design'
inspired approach to quantify overall MNQC performance in terms of hardware
models of internode links, entanglement distillation, and local architecture.
In the case of superconducting MNQCs with microwave-to-optical links, we
uncover a tradeoff between entanglement generation and distillation that
threatens to degrade performance. We show how to navigate this tradeoff, lay
out how compilers should optimize between local and internode gates, and
discuss when noisy quantum links have an advantage over purely classical links.
Using these results, we introduce a roadmap for the realization of early MNQCs
which illustrates potential improvements to the hardware and software of MNQCs
and outlines criteria for evaluating the landscape, from progress in
entanglement generation and quantum memory to dedicated algorithms such as
distributed quantum phase estimation. While we focus on superconducting devices
with optical interconnects, our approach is general across MNQC
implementations.

galaxies, the metal-rich (red) GC fraction $f(red)$ increases steadily with
galaxy mass, until halo mass $M_h \simeq 3 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Above
this point, more than half the metal-poor (blue) GCs come from accreted

practically attractive and scalable RB protocols implement random quantum
circuits with local gates randomly drawn from some gate-set. Despite their
abundance in practice, for those non-uniform RB protocols, general guarantees

Prominent examples include linear cross-entropy benchmarking, character

upon recent results for random circuits, we show that many relevant filtered RB

provide explicit small constants for common instances. We further derive

information about the physics of the interstellar medium (ISM). We apply the
scattering transform (ST) to characterize HI emission structure via a set of
compact and interpretable coefficients, and find a connection between HI
emission morphology and HI cold neutral medium (CNM) phase content. Where HI
absorption measurements are unavailable, the HI phase structure is typically
estimated from the emission via spectral line decomposition. Here we present
the first probe of CNM content using measures solely derived from HI emission
spatial information. We apply the scattering transform to GALFA-HI data at high
Galactic latitudes (|b|>30 deg), and compare the resulting coefficients to CNM
fraction measurements derived from archival HI emission and absorption spectra.
We quantify the correlation between the ST coefficients and measured CNM
fraction (fCNM), and find that HI emission morphology encodes substantial
fCNM-correlating information, and that ST-based metrics for small-scale
linearity are particularly predictive of fCNM. This is further corroborated by
the enhancement of $I_{857}/N_{HI}$ ratio with larger ST measures of
small-scale linearity. These results are consistent with the picture that
regions with higher CNM content are more populated with small-scale filamentary
HI structures. Our work illustrates a physical connection between HI morphology

improved by making use of both HI spectral and spatial information.

non-axisymmetric resonance features in the stellar disc. Using Roadmapping (an
action-based dynamical modelling framework to estimate the gravitational
potential and the stellar distribution function), we systematically quantify
the robustness of action-based modelling in the presence of a bar. We construct
a set of test-particle simulations of barred galaxies (with varying bar
properties), and apply Roadmapping to different survey volumes (with varying
azimuthal position, size) drawn from these barred models. For realistic bar
parameters, the global potential parameters are still recovered to within
${\sim \! 1 \! - \! 20}$ percent. However, with increasing bar strength, the
best-fit values of the parameters progressively deviate from their true values.
This happens due to a combination of radial heating, radial migration, and
resonance overlap phenomena in our bar models. Furthermore, the azimuthal
location and the size of the survey volumes play important roles in the
successful recovery of the parameters. Survey volumes along the bar major axis
produce larger (relative) errors in the best-fit parameter values. In addition,
the potential parameters are better recovered for survey volumes with larger
spatial coverage. As the Sun is located just ${\sim \! 28 \! - \! 33}$ degrees

defined by the existence of a habitable band at the transition between a

show that for water-limited planets it is possible to have scorching
temperatures in the ""eye"" and freezing temperatures on the nightside, while
maintaining a temperate climate in the terminator region, due to a reduced
atmospheric energy transport. Whereas on water-rich planets, increasing stellar
flux leads to increased atmospheric energy transport and a reduction in
day-night temperature differences, such that the terminator does not remain
habitable once the dayside temperatures approach runaway or moist greenhouse
limits. We also show that, while water-abundant simulations may result in
larger fractional habitability, they are vulnerable to water loss through
cold-trapping on the nightside surface or atmospheric water vapor escape,
suggesting that even if planets were formed with abundant water, their climates
could become water-limited and subject to terminator habitability.

produces a distribution of possible outcomes. This distribution - or its
Fourier transform known as full counting statistics (FCS) - contains much more
information than say the mean value of the measured observable and accessing it
is sometimes the only way to obtain relevant information about the system. In
fact, the FCS is the limit of an even more general family of observables - the
charged moments - that characterise how quantum entanglement is split in
different symmetry sectors in the presence of a global symmetry. Here we
consider the evolution of the FCS and of the charged moments of a U(1) charge
truncated to a finite region after a global quantum quench. For large scales
these quantities take a simple large-deviation form, showing two different
regimes as functions of time: while for times much larger than the size of the
region they approach a stationary value set by the local equilibrium state, for
times shorter than region size they show a non-trivial dependence on time. We
show that, whenever the initial state is also U(1) symmetric, the leading order
in time of FCS and charged moments in the out-of-equilibrium regime can be
determined by means of a space-time duality. Namely, it coincides with the
stationary value in the system where the roles of time and space are exchanged.
We use this observation to find some general properties of FCS and charged
moments out-of-equilibrium, and to derive an exact expression for these
quantities in interacting integrable models. We test this expression against
exact results in the Rule 54 quantum cellular automaton and exact numerics in
the XXZ spin-1/2 chain.

such a delocalized orbital basis. In this work, starting from an initial set of

provides direct access to approximate diabatic excitation energies and, under
the Tamm--Dancoff approximation, also their corresponding electronic couplings

control a mixed traffic stream of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and
connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs) through signalized intersections. We use
CAVs as mobile traffic controllers during a newly introduced white phase,
during which CAVs will negotiate the right-of-way to lead a group of CHVs while
CHVs must follow their immediate front vehicle. The white phase will not be
activated under low CAV penetration rates, where vehicles must wait for green
signals. We have formulated this problem as a distributed mixed-integer
non-linear program and developed a methodology to form an agreement among all
vehicles on their trajectories and signal timing parameters. The agreement on
trajectories is reached through an iterative process, where CAVs update their
trajectory based on shared trajectory of other vehicles to avoid collisions and
share their trajectory with other vehicles. Additionally, the agreement on
signal timing parameters is formed through a voting process where the most
voted feasible signal timing parameters are selected. The numerical experiments
indicate that the proposed methodology can efficiently control vehicle
movements at signalized intersections under various CAV market shares. The
introduced white phase reduces the total delay by 3.2% to 94.06% compared to
cooperative trajectory and signal optimization under different CAV market
shares in our tests. In addition, our numerical results show that the proposed
technique yields reductions in total delay, ranging from 40.2% - 98.9%,

Classical dynamics for the Bianchi IX model are studied in the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formalism, where we emphasise the reality conditions needed to
obtain real Lorentzian solutions. The solutions to these reality conditions
fall into different branches, which in turn lead to different real Hamiltonian
theories, only one of which is the usual Lorentzian Bianchi IX model. We also
show the simpler case of the flat Bianchi I model, for which both the reality

Finally, we study the quantum theory of homogeneous and isotropic models, for
which the pure connection action for general relativity reduces to a pure

quenched at high accretion rates (soft state). We show that CR-driven outflows
can be powered at low accretion rates and at large radii, whereas radiation
pressure-driven outflows dominate at high accretion rates and small radii. Thus
the two AGN feedback mechanisms -- CRs and radiation pressure on dust -- may
play complementary roles in driving cool outflows on galactic scales. The

people as possible, have explicitly focused on how we can support and allow for
the autonomy and independence of people with disabilities, neurotypes, chronic
conditions, and older adults. Despite these efforts, not all technology is
designed or implemented to support everyone's needs. Recently, a
community-organized push by creators and general users of TikTok urged the
platform to add accessibility features, such as closed captioning to
user-generated content, allowing more people to use the platform with greater
ease. Our work focuses on an understudied population -- people with ADHD and
those who experience similar challenges -- exploring the creative practices
people from this community engage in, focusing on the kinds of accessibility
they create through their creative work. Through an interview study exploring
the experiences of creatives on TikTok, we find that creatives engage in
critical infrastructuring -- a process of bottom-up (re)design -- to make the
platform more accessible despite the challenges the platform presents to them
as creators. We present these critical infrastructuring practices through the
themes of: creating and augmenting video editing infrastructures and creating
and augmenting video captioning infrastructures. We reflect on the introduction
of a top-down infrastructure - the implementation of an auto-captioning feature
- shifts the critical infrastructure practices of content creators. Through
their infrastructuring, creatives revised sociotechnical capabilities of TikTok
to support their own needs as well as the broader needs of the TikTok
community. We discuss how the routine of infrastructuring accessibility is
actually best conceptualized as incidental care work. We further highlight how
accessibility is an evolving sociotechnical construct, and forward the concept
of contextual accessibility.

Schwarzschild black hole. We compute the thermodynamic quantities like entropy,
Hawking temperature and heat capacity. The area of black holes never decreases
because they absorb everything from their surroundings due to high gravity. In
this regard, the area-entropy relation proposed by Bekenstein needs to be
corrected, leading to the concept of logarithmic corrections. To do so, we
obtain the corrected entropy for new Schwarzschild black hole to analyze the
effects of thermal fluctuations and we evaluate the thermodynamic quantities
like specific heat, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, Gibbs free energy,
enthalpy and pressure in the presence of correction parameter $\eta$.
Furthermore, we check the stability of the system with the help of heat
capacity and well known Hessian matrix technique. By our graphical analysis, we
observe that the thermal fluctuations effects the stability of small radii
black holes (e.g., New Schwarzchild black hole) and therefore, small black
holes get unstable regions due to these first order corrections.

  Understanding","Accepted in Asilomar Conference 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video understanding is a growing field and a subject of intense research,
which includes many interesting tasks to understanding both spatial and
temporal information, e.g., action detection, action recognition, video
captioning, video retrieval. One of the most challenging problems in video
understanding is dealing with feature extraction, i.e. extract contextual
visual representation from given untrimmed video due to the long and
complicated temporal structure of unconstrained videos. Different from existing
approaches, which apply a pre-trained backbone network as a black-box to
extract visual representation, our approach aims to extract the most contextual
information with an explainable mechanism. As we observed, humans typically
perceive a video through the interactions between three main factors, i.e., the
actors, the relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, it is
very crucial to design a contextual explainable video representation extraction
that can capture each of such factors and model the relationships between them.
In this paper, we discuss approaches, that incorporate the human perception
process into modeling actors, objects, and the environment. We choose video
paragraph captioning and temporal action detection to illustrate the
effectiveness of human perception based-contextual representation in video
understanding. Source code is publicly available at

irreducibles. In addition, an integral domain $R$ satisfies the ascending chain
condition on principal ideals (ACCP) if every increasing sequence of principal
ideals (under inclusion) becomes constant from one point on. Although it is not
hard to verify that every integral domain satisfying ACCP is atomic, examples
of atomic domains that do not satisfy ACCP are notoriously hard to construct.
The first of such examples was constructed by A. Grams back in 1974. In this
paper we delve into the class of atomic domains that do not satisfy ACCP. To
better understand this class, we introduce the notion of weak-ACCP domains,
which generalizes that of integral domains satisfying ACCP. Strongly atomic
domains were introduced by D. D. Anderson, D. F. Anderson, and M. Zafrullah in
1990. It turns out that every weak-ACCP domain is strongly atomic, and so we
introduce a taxonomic classification on our class of interest: ACCP implies
weak-ACCP, which implies strong atomicity, which implies atomicity. We study
this chain of implications, putting special emphasis on the weak-ACCP property.
This allows us to provide new examples of atomic domains that do not satisfy
ACCP.

particles with mass of order $M$, we show that the leading deviations from the
Standard Model can be parameterized by a finite number of `primary' operators,
with the remaining operators given by `Mandelstam descendants' whose effects
are suppressed by powers of Mandelstam variables divided by $M$. This
classification does not rely on any effective field theory power counting rule

decoupling). We explicitly determine all 3 and 4-point primary operators
relevant for Higgs signals at colliders. We give a detailed discussion of the

determining the independent operators. The results are checked using the

Local policy regimes provide flexibility between regions, but may become less

Due to the endogenous nature of policymaking, there have been few opportunities
to reliably estimate causal spillover effects or evaluate their impact on local
policies. In this work, we identify a novel setting and develop a suitable
methodology that allow us to make unconfounded estimates of spillover effects
of local policies. Focusing on California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy, we
leverage how county-level mobility restrictions were deterministically set by
public COVID-19 severity statistics, enabling a regression discontinuity design
framework to estimate spillovers between counties. We estimate these effects
using a mobility network with billions of timestamped edges and find
significant spillover movement, with larger effects in retail, eating places,

suggest that county-level restrictions are only 54% as effective as statewide
restrictions at reducing mobility. However, an intermediate strategy of
macro-county restrictions -- where we optimize county partitions by solving a
minimum k-cut problem on a graph weighted by our spillover estimates -- can
recover over 90% of statewide mobility reductions, while maintaining

a challenging numerical and algorithmic problem in large part due to the

single-photon sources. Dephasing broadens the spectral line and suppresses the
indistinguishability of the emitted photons, which is undesirable for many
applications, primarily for quantum computing. We consider a light emitted by a
two-level system with a pulsed incoherent pump in the presence of the spectral
filter. The spectral filter allows control of the second-order autocorrelation
function, indistinguishability, and quantum yield. We show that narrow spectral
filters can increase the indistinguishability of the emitted light while
undermining the quantum yield. The influence of the spectral filter on the
second-order correlation function depends on the duration of the pump. When the
pumping pulse is long compared to the lifetime of the two-level system, the
narrow spectral filters lead to a rapid increase in the second-order
autocorrelation function. In this limit, the statistics of the light from the
two-level system inherit the statistics of the incoherent pump. In the case of
the short duration of the pump pulse, it is possible to preserve single-photon
properties to some degree for the sub-lifetime width of the spectral filter.
Moreover, when the light emitted by the single-photon source is used to control
a quantum system, e.g., cavity, the single-photon properties of the light
manifest themselves differently, depending on the response time of the quantum
system. In particular, in the case of long response time, the spectral filter
with sub-lifetime width can provide the near-zero second-order autocorrelation

the inner Galaxy, two different solutions, the ``Near'' solution, and the
``Far'' solution, can be derived simultaneously. We attempted to construct a
two-class (``Near'' or ``Far'') inference model using a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), a form of deep learning that can capture spatial features
generally. In this study, we used the CO dataset toward the 1st quadrant of the
Galactic plane obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope (l = 62-10
degree, |b| < 1 degree). In the model, we applied the three-dimensional
distribution (position-position-velocity) of the 12CO (J=1-0) emissions as the
main input. The dataset with ``Near'' or ``Far'' annotation was made from the

weights using a single unlabeled test image. In this approach, we do not assume
test-time access to the labeled source dataset. More specifically, our TTA
method consists of using the keypoints estimates as pseudo labels and
backpropagating them to adjust the backbone weights. The second approach is a
training-time generalization (TTG) method, where we permit offline access to
the labeled source dataset but not the test-time modification of weights.
Furthermore, we do not assume the availability of any images from or knowledge

features with those generated by the keypoints head and feeding the aggregate
vector to the mask head. Through a comprehensive set of ablations, we evaluate

hurt and TTG show only a small gain in performance, whereas for a large domain
shift, TTA gains are smaller and dependent on the heuristics used, while TTG

encoding masked inputs, and then predicting contextualised targets generated by
slowly-evolving momentum encoders. Driven by the inherent differences between

which the encoders are jointly trained. Notably, RAVEn surpasses all
self-supervised methods on visual speech recognition (VSR) on LRS3, and
combining RAVEn with self-training using only 30 hours of labelled data even
outperforms a recent semi-supervised method trained on 90,000 hours of

moreover, every character of low degree is either itself of low level or

an issue especially in the open-source community. Because the high-level
meaning of a protocol is often lost in translation to low-level languages when
a custom protocol needs to be designed, extra documentation is required, the
interpretation of which introduces new opportunities for errors.
  The Tydi specification (Tydi-spec) was proposed to address the above issues
by codifying the composite and variable-length data structures in a type and
providing a standard protocol to transfer typed data among hardware components.
The Tydi intermediate representation (Tydi-IR) extends the Tydi-spec by
defining typed interfaces, typed components, and connections among typed

  In this paper, we propose Tydi-lang, a high-level hardware description
language (HDL) for streaming designs. The language incorporates Tydi-spec to
describe typed streams and provides templates to describe abstract reusable

blueprint to identify streaming bottlenecks. We show several Tydi-lang examples

energy deposition, and what are the important physical processes that transport
that energy from the release site in the corona through the transition region
and chromosphere? Attacking these questions requires the concert of advanced
numerical simulations and high spatial-, temporal-, and spectral- resolution
observations. While flares are 3D phenomenon, simulating the NLTE flaring
chromosphere in 3D and performing parameter studies of 3D models is largely

different splits of the available dataset. Ultimately, we obtain 25 models, of

learning strategy, and add an auxiliary classification task, the Image Quality
Assessment, to improve the model performance. Our final ensemble model achieved
a quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9346 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of
0.9766 on the internal testing dataset, and the QWK of 0.839 and the AUC of

Specifically, we investigate sparse attention as an alternative to dense
attention weights in the task of in-hospital mortality prediction from clinical
notes. We evaluate the attention mechanisms based on: i) local self-attention
over words in a sentence, and ii) global self-attention with a transformer
architecture across sentences. We demonstrate that the sparse mechanism
approach outperforms the dense one for the local self-attention in terms of
predictive performance with a publicly available dataset, and puts higher
attention to prespecified relevant directive words. The performance at the
sentence level, however, deteriorates as sentences including the influential
directive words tend to be dropped all together.

formation. In this paper, a stochastic model is proposed for biofilm formation,
using bacterial quorum sensing (QS). In this model, the biological processes in
the biofilm formation are modeled as a chemical reaction network which includes
bacterial reproduction, productions of autoinducer and EPS, and their
diffusion. The modified explicit tau-leap simulation algorithm is adapted based
on the two-state QS mechanism. Our approach is validated by using the
experimental results of $\textit{Pseudomonas putida}$ IsoF bacteria for
autoinducer and bacteria concentration. It is also shown that the percentage of
EPS in the biofilm increases significantly after the state change in QS, while
it decreases before QS is activated. The presented work shows how the biofilm
growth can be modeled realistically by using the QS mechanism in stochastic

includes the top-to-random shuffle. The general shuffling scheme consists of
removing one card at a time from the deck (according to some probability
distribution) and re-inserting it at a (uniformly) random position further
below. Rewritten in terms of the group algebra $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$, our shuffle
corresponds to right multiplication by a linear combination of the elements
\[t_i:=\text{cyc}_{i}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,i+2}+\cdots+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,\ldots,n}\in

$\text{cyc}_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_p}$ stands for a $p$-cycle).
  We compute the eigenvalues of these shuffling operators and of all their
linear combinations. In particular, we show that the eigenvalues of right
multiplication by a linear combination
$\lambda_1t_1+\lambda_2t_2+\cdots+\lambda_nt_n$ are the numbers
$\lambda_1m_{I,1}+\lambda_2m_{I,2}+\cdots+\lambda_nm_{I,n}$, where $I$ ranges
over the subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ that contain no two consecutive

these eigenvalues and show that if they are all distinct, the shuffling
operator is diagonalizable. To this purpose, we show that the operators of
right multiplication by $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$ on $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$ are
simultaneously triangularizable (via a combinatorially defined basis). The
results stated here over $\mathbb{R}$ for convenience are actually stated and
proved over an arbitrary commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$.

problem, motivated by applications to cognitive radio systems. Most research
for this problem focuses exclusively on the settings that players have
\textit{full access} to all arms and receive no reward when pulling the same
arm. Hence all players solve the same bandit problem with the goal of
maximizing their cumulative reward. However, these settings neglect several
important factors in many real-world applications, where players have
\textit{limited access} to \textit{a dynamic local subset of arms} (i.e., an
arm could sometimes be ``walking'' and not accessible to the player). To this
end, this paper proposes a \textit{multi-player multi-armed walking bandits}
model, aiming to address aforementioned modeling issues. The goal now is to
maximize the reward, however, players can only pull arms from the local subset
and only collect a full reward if no other players pull the same arm. We adopt
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff

independent of spin if the observer is outside the cone, and nearly independent
of spin if the observer is inside the cone. If astrophysical uncertainties can
be controlled for, then spin displacement is large enough to be detectable by
future space VLBI missions. Finally, we consider ring substructure in the dual

to compare the stellar populations of the bulge and disc components, identified
from their Sersic profiles, for various samples of galaxies. Bulge dominated
regions tend to be more metal-rich and have slightly older stellar ages than
their associated disc dominated regions. The metallicity difference is
consistent with the deeper gravitational potential in bulges relative to discs,
which allows bulges to retain more of the metals produced by stars. The age
difference is due to star formation persisting longer in discs relative to
bulges. Relative to galaxies with lower stellar masses, galaxies with higher
stellar masses tend to have bulge dominated regions that are more metal-rich
and older (in light-weighted measurements) than their disc dominated regions.
This suggests high-mass galaxies quench from the inside out, while lower-mass
galaxies quench across the whole galaxy simultaneously. Early-type galaxies
tend to have bulge dominated regions the same age as their disc dominated
regions, while late-type galaxies tend to have disc dominated regions
significantly younger than their bulge dominated regions. Central galaxies tend
to have a greater metallicity difference between their bulge dominated regions
and disc dominated regions than satellite galaxies at similar stellar mass.
This difference may be explained by central galaxies being subject to mergers
or extended gas accretion bringing new, lower-metallicity gas to the disc,
thereby reducing the average metallicity and age of the stars; quenching of
satellite discs may also play a role.

multi-qubit probe states in quantum sensors because they are easy to prepare
and can be controlled without requiring individual addressability. Here, we
give quantum error correction protocols for estimating the magnitude of
classical fields using symmetric probe states. To achieve this, we first
develop a general theory for quantum error correction on the symmetric
subspace. This theory, based on the representation theory of the symmetric
group, allows us to construct efficient algorithms that can correct any
correctible error on any permutation-invariant code. These algorithms involve
measurements of total angular momentum, quantum Schur transforms or logical
state teleportations, and geometric pulse gates. For deletion errors, we give a
simpler quantum error correction algorithm based on primarily on geometric
pulse gates. Second, we devise a simple quantum sensing scheme on symmetric
probe states that works in spite of a linear rate of deletion errors, and
analyze its asymptotic performance. In our scheme, we repeatedly project the
probe state onto the codespace while the signal accumulates. When the time
spent to accumulate the signal is constant, our scheme can do phase estimation
with precision that approaches the best possible in the noiseless setting.
Third, we give near-term implementations of our algorithms.

central nervous system, muscle, connective tissue, bone, and environment. As a
simplifying assumption, many previous studies have often assumed that
sufficient internal force is available to produce observed kinematics, thus not
focusing on quantifying the interconnection between muscle effort, body shape,
and external reaction forces. This interplay, however, is critical to
locomotion performance in crawling animals, especially when accompanied by body
viscoelasticity. Moreover, in bio-inspired robotic applications, the body's
internal damping is indeed a parameter that the designer can tune. Still, the
effect of internal damping is not well understood. This study explores how
internal damping affects the locomotion performance of a crawler with a
continuous, visco-elastic, nonlinear beam model. Crawler muscle actuation is
modeled as a traveling wave of bending moment propagating posteriorly along the
body. Consistent with the friction properties of the scales of snakes and
limbless lizards, environmental forces are modeled using anisotropic Coulomb
friction. It is found that by varying the crawler body's internal damping, the
crawler's performance can be altered, and distinct gaits could be achieved,
including changing the net locomotion direction from forward to back. We will
discuss this forward and backward control and identify the optimal internal
damping for peak crawling speed.

study the membership, phase-space structure, mass, and energy (kinetic plus
potential) distribution of the Perseus star-forming region using public
catalogues (Gaia, APOGEE, 2MASS, PanSTARRS). Methods. We use Bayesian
methodologies accounting for extinction to identify the Perseus physical groups
in the phase-space, retrieve their candidate members, derive their properties
(age, mass, 3D positions, 3D velocities, and energy), and attempt to
reconstruct their origin. Results. We identify 1052 candidate members in seven
physical groups (one of them new) with ages between 3 and 10 Myr, dynamical
super-virial states, and large fractions of energetically unbound stars. Their
mass distributions are broadly compatible with that of Chabrier for masses >0.1
$M_\odot$ and do not show hints of over-abundance of low-mass stars in NGC1333

are compatible with at least three generations of stars. Future work is still
needed to clarify if the formation of the youngest was triggered by the oldest.
Conclusions. The exquisite Gaia data complemented with public archives and
mined with comprehensive Bayesian methodologies allow us to identify 31% more
members than in previous studies, discover a new physical group (Gorgophone: 7
Myr, 191 members, and 145 $M_\odot$), and confirm that the spatial, kinematic,

  Systems","To appear in IEEE TETC",,,,"cs.AR cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Partitioning applications between NDP and host CPU cores causes inter-segment
data movement overhead, which is caused by moving data generated from one
segment (e.g., instructions, functions) and used in consecutive segments. Prior
works take two approaches to this problem. The first class of works maps
segments to NDP or host cores based on the properties of each segment,
neglecting the inter-segment data movement overhead. The second class of works
partitions applications based on the overall memory bandwidth saving of each
segment, and does not offload each segment to the best-fitting core if they
incur high inter-segment data movement. We show that 1) mapping each segment to
its best-fitting core ideally can provide substantial benefits, and 2) the
inter-segment data movement reduces this benefit significantly.
  To this end, we introduce ALP, a new programmer-transparent technique to
leverage the performance benefits of NDP by alleviating the inter-segment data
movement overhead between host and memory and enabling efficient partitioning
of applications. ALP alleviates the inter-segment data movement overhead by
proactively and accurately transferring the required data between the segments.
This is based on the key observation that the instructions that generate the
inter-segment data stay the same across different executions of a program on
different inputs. ALP uses a compiler pass to identify these instructions and
uses specialized hardware to transfer data between the host and NDP cores at
runtime. ALP efficiently maps application segments to either host or NDP
considering 1) the properties of each segment, 2) the inter-segment data
movement overhead, and 3) whether this overhead can be alleviated in a timely
manner. We evaluate ALP across a wide range of workloads and show on average
54.3% and 45.4% speedup compared to only-host CPU or only-NDP executions,
respectively.

leverage operator capabilities in order to meet the goals of complex
manufacturing systems towards human-centricity, resilience and sustainability.
This article first describes the essential concepts for the development of
Industry 5.0 CPHSs and then analyzes the latest CPHSs, identifying their main
design requirements and key implementation components. Moreover, the major
challenges for the development of such CPHSs are outlined. Next, to illustrate
the previously described concepts, a real-world Industry 5.0 CPHS is presented.
Such a CPHS enables increased operator safety and operation tracking in
manufacturing processes that rely on collaborative robots and heavy machinery.
Specifically, the proposed use case consists of a workshop where a smarter use
of resources is required, and human proximity detection determines when
machinery should be working or not in order to avoid incidents or accidents
involving such machinery. The proposed CPHS makes use of a hybrid edge
computing architecture with smart mist computing nodes that processes thermal
images and reacts to prevent industrial safety issues. The performed
experiments show that, in the selected real-world scenario, the developed CPHS
algorithms are able to detect human presence with low-power devices (with a
Raspberry Pi 3B) in a fast and accurate way (in less than 10 ms with a 97.04%
accuracy), thus being an effective solution that can be integrated into many
Industry 5.0 applications. Finally, this article provides specific guidelines
that will help future developers and managers to overcome the challenges that
will arise when deploying the next generation of CPHSs for smart and

important sources of $^{26}$Al and $^{22}$Na. While gamma rays from the decay
of the former radioisotope have been observed throughout the Galaxy, $^{22}$Na
remains untraceable. The half-life of $^{22}$Na (2.6 yr) would allow the
observation of its 1.275 MeV gamma-ray line from a cosmic source. However, the
prediction of such an observation requires good knowledge of the nuclear
reactions involved in the production and destruction of this nucleus. The
$^{22}$Na($p,\gamma$)$^{23}$Mg reaction remains the only source of large
uncertainty about the amount of $^{22}$Na ejected. Its rate is dominated by a
single resonance on the short-lived state at 7785.0(7) keV in $^{23}$Mg. In the
present work, a combined analysis of particle-particle correlations and
velocity-difference profiles is proposed to measure femtosecond nuclear
lifetimes. The application of this novel method to the study of the $^{23}$Mg
states, combining magnetic and highly-segmented tracking gamma-ray
spectrometers, places strong limits on the amount of $^{22}$Na produced in
novae, explains its non-observation to date in gamma rays (flux < 2.5x$10^{-4}$
ph/(cm$^2$s)), and constrains its detectability with future space-borne
observatories.

identifying stochastic dynamic equation to evaluate reliability of
stochastically-excited dynamical systems for which the governing physics is
\textit{apriori} unknown. A two-stage approach is adopted: in the first stage,
an efficient variational Bayesian equation discovery algorithm is developed to
determine the governing physics of an underlying stochastic differential
equation (SDE) from measured output data. The developed algorithm is efficient
and accounts for epistemic uncertainty due to limited and noisy data, and
aleatoric uncertainty because of environmental effect and external excitation.
In the second stage, the discovered SDE is solved using a stochastic
integration scheme and the probability failure is computed. The efficacy of the
proposed approach is illustrated on three numerical examples. The results
obtained indicate the possible application of the proposed approach for
reliability analysis of in-situ and heritage structures from on-site

combining (by multiplication) three matrices: one matrix represents movements,
another niche tolerances, and a third, biotic interactions. Results are derived
from general properties of this product and from simulation of a cellular
automaton defined in terms of the matrix operations. Everything is implemented
practically in an R package. Results Results are obtained by simulation and by
mathematical analysis. We show that the mid-domain effect is a direct
consequence of dispersal; that to include movements to Ecological Niche
Modeling significantly affects results, but cannot be done without choosing an
ancestral area of distribution. We discuss ways of estimating such ancestral
areas. We show that, in our approach, movements and niche effects are mixed in
ways almost impossible to disentangle, and show this is a consequence of the
singularity of a matrix. We introduce a tool (the
Connectivity-Suitability-Dispersal plot) to extend the results of simple niche
modeling to understand the effects of dispersal. Main conclusions The
conceptually straightforward scheme we present for the area of distribution
integrates, in a mathematically sound and computationally feasible way, several
key ideas in biogeography: the geographic and environmental matrix, the
Grinnellian niche, dispersal capacity and the ancestral area of origin of
groups of species. We show that although full simulations are indispensable to
obtain the dynamics of an area of distribution, interesting results can be
derived simply by analyzing the matrices representing the dynamics.

to increase the energy range (by more than one order of magnitude) and the

create human-interpretable rules for making choices around the allocation of
different policy interventions. However, in realistic policy-making contexts,
decision-makers often care about trade-offs between outcomes, not just
singlemindedly maximising utility for one outcome. This paper proposes an
approach termed Multi-Objective Policy Learning (MOPoL) which combines optimal
decision trees for policy learning with a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation
approach to explore the trade-off between multiple outcomes. It does this by
building a Pareto frontier of non-dominated models for different hyperparameter
settings. The key here is that a low-cost surrogate function can be an accurate
proxy for the very computationally costly optimal tree in terms of expected
regret. This surrogate can be fit many times with different hyperparameter
values to proxy the performance of the optimal model. The method is applied to
a real-world case-study of conditional cash transfers in Morocco where hybrid
(partially optimal, partially greedy) policy trees provide good performance as
a surrogate for optimal trees while being computationally cheap enough to
feasibly fit a Pareto frontier.

  Development","This paper is submitted to the related journal",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The JPEG standard is widely used in different image processing applications.
One of the main components of the JPEG standard is the quantisation table (QT)
since it plays a vital role in the image properties such as image quality and
file size. In recent years, several efforts based on population-based
metaheuristic (PBMH) algorithms have been performed to find the proper QT(s)
for a specific image, although they do not take into consideration the user
opinion in advance. Take an android developer as an example, who prefers a
small-size image, while the optimisation process results in a high-quality
image, leading to a huge file size. Another pitfall of the current works is a
lack of comprehensive coverage, meaning that the QT(s) can not provide all
possible combinations of file size and quality. Therefore, this paper aims to
propose three distinct contributions. First, to include the user opinion in the
compression process, the file size of the output image can be controlled by a
user in advance. To this end, we propose a novel objective function for
population-based JPEG image compression. Second, to tackle the lack of
comprehensive coverage, we suggest a novel representation. Our proposed
representation can not only provide more comprehensive coverage but also find
the proper value for the quality factor for a specific image without any
background knowledge. Both changes in representation and objective function are
independent of the search strategies and can be used with any type of
population-based metaheuristic (PBMH) algorithm. Therefore, as the third
contribution, we also provide a comprehensive benchmark on 22 state-of-the-art
and recently-introduced PBMH algorithms. Our extensive experiments on different
benchmark images and in terms of different criteria show that our novel

numerical experiment to deblur an image that the convergence behavior in the
logarithmic-scale ordinate tends to be linear instead of logarithmic,
approximating to be flat. Making meticulous observations, we find that the
previous assumption for the smooth part to be convex weakens the least-square
model. Specifically, assuming the smooth part to be strongly convex is more
reasonable for the least-square model, even though the image matrix is probably
ill-conditioned. Furthermore, we improve the pivotal inequality tighter for
composite optimization with the smooth part to be strongly convex instead of
general convex, which is first found in [Li et al., 2022]. Based on this
pivotal inequality, we generalize the linear convergence to composite
optimization in both the objective value and the squared proximal subgradient
norm. Meanwhile, we set a simple ill-conditioned matrix which is easy to
compute the singular values instead of the original blur matrix. The new
numerical experiment shows the proximal generalization of Nesterov's
accelerated gradient descent (NAG) for the strongly convex function has a
faster linear convergence rate than ISTA. Based on the tighter pivotal
inequality, we also generalize the faster linear convergence rate to composite

slight modification and the phase-space representation based on the

develop a type-theoretic approach to data layout that could be used as a typed
intermediate language in a compiler or to give a programmer more control. Our
starting point is a computational interpretation of the semi-axiomatic sequent
calculus for intuitionistic logic that defines abstract notions of cells and
addresses. We refine this semantics so addresses have more structure to reflect
possible alternative layouts without fundamentally departing from
intuitionistic logic. We then add recursive types and explore example programs
and properties of the resulting language.

utilizes feature embeddings from shared/per-entity feature extractors

propose two specific methods and compare them with a baseline method. In Shared
Feature Extractor (SFE) Learning, the entities use a shared feature extractor
to compute feature embeddings of samples. In Locally Trained Feature Extractor
(LTFE) Learning, each entity uses a separate feature extractor and models are
trained using concatenated features from all entities. As a baseline, in
Cooperatively Trained Feature Extractor (CTFE) Learning, the entities train
models by sharing raw data. Secure multi-party algorithms are utilized to train
models without revealing data or features in plain text. We investigate the
trade-offs among SFE, LTFE, and CTFE in regard to performance, privacy leakage
(using an off-the-shelf membership inference attack), and computational cost.
LTFE provides the most privacy, followed by SFE, and then CTFE. Computational
cost is lowest for SFE and the relative speed of CTFE and LTFE depends on
network architecture. CTFE and LTFE provide the best accuracy. We use MNIST, a
synthetic dataset, and a credit card fraud detection dataset for evaluations.

we demonstrated to be correlated with frequency shifts and mode-mixing,

clients jointly learn a model with the help of a cloud server. A fundamental
challenge of FL is that the clients are often heterogeneous, e.g., they have
different computing powers, and thus the clients may send model updates to the
server with substantially different delays. Asynchronous FL aims to address
this challenge by enabling the server to update the model once any client's
model update reaches it without waiting for other clients' model updates.
However, like synchronous FL, asynchronous FL is also vulnerable to poisoning
attacks, in which malicious clients manipulate the model via poisoning their
local data and/or model updates sent to the server. Byzantine-robust FL aims to
defend against poisoning attacks. In particular, Byzantine-robust FL can learn
an accurate model even if some clients are malicious and have Byzantine
behaviors. However, most existing studies on Byzantine-robust FL focused on
synchronous FL, leaving asynchronous FL largely unexplored. In this work, we
bridge this gap by proposing AFLGuard, a Byzantine-robust asynchronous FL
method. We show that, both theoretically and empirically, AFLGuard is robust
against various existing and adaptive poisoning attacks (both untargeted and
targeted). Moreover, AFLGuard outperforms existing Byzantine-robust
asynchronous FL methods.

realizing CMOS-compatible, high-performance photonic integrated circuits
(PICs). But in recent years, the silicon-nitride-on-silicon-dioxide
(SiN-on-SiO$_2$) platform has garnered increasing interest as an alternative to
the SOI platform for realizing high-performance PICs. This is because of its
several beneficial properties over the SOI platform, such as low optical
losses, high thermo-optic stability, broader wavelength transparency range, and
high tolerance to fabrication-process variations. However, SiN-on-SiO$_2$ based
active devices such as modulators are scarce and lack in desired performance,
due to the absence of free-carrier based activity in the SiN material and the
complexity of integrating other active materials with SiN-on-SiO$_2$ platform.
This shortcoming hinders the SiN-on-SiO$_2$ platform for realizing active PICs.
To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate a SiN-on-SiO$_2$ microring
resonator (MRR) based active modulator in this article. Our designed MRR
modulator employs an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO)-SiN-ITO thin-film stack, in which
the ITO thin films act as the upper and lower claddings of the SiN MRR. The
ITO-SiN-ITO thin-film stack leverages the free-carrier assisted, high-amplitude
refractive index change in the ITO films to effect a large electro-refractive
optical modulation in the device. Based on the electrostatic, transient, and
finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, conducted using photonics
foundry-validated tools, we show that our modulator achieves 280 pm/V resonance
modulation efficiency, 67.8 GHz 3-dB modulation bandwidth, $\sim$19 nm

with a previously extended state, a noticeable spin-dependent asymmetry in the
interface spectrum in the vicinity of the Weyl nodes. We study these effects
with a lattice model which we solve numerically on a finite sample and
analytically through using an ansatz on an infinite sample. Our ansatz agrees
very well with the numerical simulation as it accurately describes the
behaviour of the chiral state, from its energy asymmetry to the spin canting at
the interface. We find that the tunnelling effectively increases the Fermi arc
length, allowing for the presence of interface states beyond the bare Weyl
nodes. These additional states may carry current along the interface and their
contribution can be detected in the conductance. Across the interface, the
spin-independent conductance reproduces the results of an electron tunnelling
experiment to reveal the WSM's density of states. Besides conductivity, the
effect of tunnelling between the WSM and the metallic band can be seen in
quantum oscillations experiments which we briefly comment about.

learning models and tasks, which works for information fusion and structured

fundamentals, its practical implementations often depend on empirical
mechanisms and thus lead to sub-optimal, even unsatisfactory performance. In
this work, we develop a novel and generalized global pooling framework through
the lens of optimal transport. The proposed framework is interpretable from the
perspective of expectation-maximization. Essentially, it aims at learning an
optimal transport across sample indices and feature dimensions, making the
corresponding pooling operation maximize the conditional expectation of input
data. We demonstrate that most existing pooling methods are equivalent to
solving a regularized optimal transport (ROT) problem with different
specializations, and more sophisticated pooling operations can be implemented
by hierarchically solving multiple ROT problems. Making the parameters of the
ROT problem learnable, we develop a family of regularized optimal transport

algorithms. We test our ROTP layers in several representative set-level machine
learning scenarios, including multi-instance learning (MIL), graph
classification, graph set representation, and image classification.
Experimental results show that applying our ROTP layers can reduce the
difficulty of the design and selection of global pooling -- our ROTP layers may
either imitate some existing global pooling methods or lead to some new pooling
layers fitting data better. The code is available at

calculating the imaginary part of three-loop top-quark self-energy diagrams.
The results are all expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms and valid in
the whole region $0\le m_W^2\le m_t^2$. The expansions in the $m_W^2\to 0$ and
$m_W^2\to m_t^2$ limits coincide with previous studies. Our results can also be
taken as the exact prediction for the lepton invariant mass spectrum in

Combining these contributions with electroweak corrections and the finite

infinite-dimensional function spaces via deep neural networks. As promising
surrogate solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) for real-time

provide a new simulation paradigm in science and engineering. Pure data-driven
neural operators and deep learning models, in general, are usually limited to
interpolation scenarios, where new predictions utilize inputs within the
support of the training set. However, in the inference stage of real-world
applications, the input may lie outside the support, i.e., extrapolation is
required, which may result to large errors and unavoidable failure of deep
learning models. Here, we address this challenge of extrapolation for deep
neural operators. First, we systematically investigate the extrapolation
behavior of DeepONets by quantifying the extrapolation complexity via the
2-Wasserstein distance between two function spaces and propose a new behavior
of bias-variance trade-off for extrapolation with respect to model capacity.
Subsequently, we develop a complete workflow, including extrapolation
determination, and we propose five reliable learning methods that guarantee a
safe prediction under extrapolation by requiring additional information -- the
governing PDEs of the system or sparse new observations. The proposed methods
are based on either fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepONet or multifidelity
learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for
various types of parametric PDEs. Our systematic comparisons provide practical
guidelines for selecting a proper extrapolation method depending on the

with any data with a spatial relationship, besides images, and have been
applied to different fields. However, recent works have highlighted how CNNs,

jeopardise their performance. This paper quantifies the numerical uncertainty
of the floating point arithmetic inaccuracies of the inference stage of
DeepGOPlus, a CNN that predicts protein function, in order to determine its
numerical stability. In addition, this paper investigates the possibility to
use reduced-precision floating point formats for DeepGOPlus inference to reduce
memory consumption and latency. This is achieved with Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a
technique that experimentally quantifies floating point operation errors and
VPREC, a tool that emulates results with customizable floating point precision
formats. Focus is placed on the inference stage as it is the main deliverable
of the DeepGOPlus model that will be used across environments and therefore
most likely be subjected to the most amount of noise. Furthermore, studies have
shown that the inference stage is the part of the model which is most disposed
to being scaled down in terms of reduced precision. All in all, it has been
found that the numerical uncertainty of the DeepGOPlus CNN is very low at its
current numerical precision format, but the model cannot currently be reduced
to a lower precision that might render it more lightweight.

to help position them sufficiently close to the apex of the needle-shaped
specimen. However, possible structural damage associated to the energetic
electrons used to perform TKD is rarely considered and is hence not
well-understood. Here, in two case studies, we evidence damage in APT specimens
from TKD mapping. First, we analyze a solid solution, metastable
\b{eta}-Ti-12Mo alloy, in which the Mo is expected to be homogenously
distributed. Following TKD, APT reveals a planar segregation of Mo amongst
other elements. Second, specimens were prepared near {\Sigma}3 twin boundaries
in a high manganese twinning-induced plasticity steel, and subsequently charged
with deuterium gas. Beyond a similar planar segregation, voids containing a
high concentration of deuterium, i.e. bubbles, are detected in the specimen on
which TKD was performed. Both examples showcase damage from TKD mapping leading
to artefacts in the compositional distribution of solutes. We propose that the
structural damage is created by surface species, including H and C, subjected
to recoil from incoming energetic electrons during mapping, thereby getting
implanted and causing cascades of structural damage in the sample.

proposed for the generation of new and realistic polar group velocity

deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or
""high-quality"" as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the
probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction
intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the
conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural
networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses
two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main
contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation
network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and
has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width
and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction
interval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a
self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss
function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a
synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield
prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal

segmentation, restoration and reconstruction, but most of them usually rely on
centralized learning and thus ignore privacy issues. To address the privacy
concerns, federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) have attracted
increasing attention. However, it is hard for both FL and SL to balance the
local computational cost, model privacy and parallel training simultaneously.
To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose Robust Split Federated Learning
(RoS-FL) for U-shaped medical image networks, which is a novel hybrid learning
paradigm of FL and SL. Previous works cannot preserve the data privacy,
including the input, model parameters, label and output simultaneously. To
effectively deal with all of them, we design a novel splitting method for
U-shaped medical image networks, which splits the network into three parts
hosted by different parties. Besides, the distributed learning methods usually
suffer from a drift between local and global models caused by data
heterogeneity. Based on this consideration, we propose a dynamic weight
correction strategy (\textbf{DWCS}) to stabilize the training process and avoid
model drift. Specifically, a weight correction loss is designed to quantify the
drift between the models from two adjacent communication rounds. By minimizing
this loss, a correction model is obtained. Then we treat the weighted sum of
correction model and final round models as the result. The effectiveness of the
proposed RoS-FL is supported by extensive experimental results on different
tasks. Related codes will be released at https://github.com/Zi-YuanYang/RoS-FL.

satisfy the convexity condition. Unlike descent line-search algorithms, it does
not need a known Lipschitz constant to figure out how big the first step should
be. The crucial feature of this process is the steady reduction of the step
size until a certain condition is fulfilled. In particular, it can provide a
new gradient projection approach to optimization problems with an unbounded
constrained set. The correctness of the proposed method is verified by
preliminary results from some computational examples. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed technique for large-scale problems, we apply it
to some experiments on machine learning, such as supervised feature selection,
multi-variable logistic regressions and neural networks for classification.

classical neural networks (NNs)? How, why, and in what aspects? In this work,
we survey and develop intuitive insights into the expressive power of MPQCs in
relation to classical NNs. We organize available sources into a systematic
proof on why MPQCs are able to generate probability distributions that cannot
be efficiently simulated classically. We first show that instantaneous quantum
polynomial circuits (IQPCs), are unlikely to be simulated classically to within
a multiplicative error, and then show that MPQCs efficiently generalize IQPCs.
We support the surveyed claims with numerical simulations: with the MPQC as the
core architecture, we build different versions of quantum generative models to
learn a given multi-dimensional, multi-modal discrete data distribution, and
show their superior performances over a classical Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) equipped with the Gumbel Softmax for generating discrete data. In
addition, we address practical issues such as how to efficiently train a
quantum circuit with only limited samples, how to efficiently calculate the
(quantum) gradient, and how to alleviate modal collapse. We propose and
experimentally verify an efficient training-and-fine-tuning scheme for lowering
the output noise and decreasing modal collapse. As an original contribution, we
develop a novel loss function (MCR loss) inspired by an information-theoretical
measure -- the coding rate reduction metric, which has a more expressive and
geometrically meaningful latent space representations -- beneficial for both
model selection and alleviating modal collapse. We derive the gradient of our
MCR loss with respect to the circuit parameters under two settings: with the
radial basis function (RBF) kernel and with a NN discriminator and conduct
experiments to showcase its effectiveness.

successfully extending GANs for generating 3D-aware portrait videos. In this

multi-view consistent portrait videos. Specifically, our method extends the
recent static 3D-aware image GAN to the video domain by generalizing the 3D
implicit neural representation to model the spatio-temporal space. To introduce
motion dynamics to the generation process, we develop a motion generator by
stacking multiple motion layers to generate motion features via modulated
convolution. To alleviate motion ambiguities caused by camera/human motions, we
propose a simple yet effective camera condition strategy for PV3D, enabling
both temporal and multi-view consistent video generation. Moreover, PV3D
introduces two discriminators for regularizing the spatial and temporal domains
to ensure the plausibility of the generated portrait videos. These elaborated
designs enable PV3D to generate 3D-aware motion-plausible portrait videos with
high-quality appearance and geometry, significantly outperforming prior works.
As a result, PV3D is able to support many downstream applications such as
animating static portraits and view-consistent video motion editing. Code and

  In this paper, we present ADEV, an extension to forward-mode AD that
correctly differentiates the expectations of probabilistic processes

from a recent Chandra survey of low-redshift, optically classified AGN pairs.
These systems are selected because they show unexpectedly low 2-10 keV X-ray

intermediate-to-late stage of merger. Circumnuclear molecular gas traced by the
CO(2-1) emission is significantly detected in 6 of the 7 pairs and 10 of the 14
nuclei, with an estimated mass ranging between $(0.2 - 21)
\times10^9\rm~M_{\odot}$. The primary nuclei, i.e., the ones with the higher
stellar velocity dispersion, tend to have a higher molecular gas mass than the
secondary. Most CO-detected nuclei show a compact morphology, with a velocity
field consistent with a kpc-scale rotating structure. The inferred hydrogen
column densities range between $5\times10^{21} - 2\times10^{23}\rm~cm^{-2}$,
but mostly at a few times $10^{22}\rm~cm^{-2}$, in broad agreement with those
derived from X-ray spectral analysis. Together with the relatively weak

Zeldovich anapole, also known as a Dirac dipole. From the science of materials
perspective, it has been established that Dirac multipoles contribute to the
diffraction of x-rays and neutrons. We identify Dirac monopoles in bulk
magnetic properties of iron tellurate (Fe2TeO6) and a spin ladder (SrFe2S2O).
Both cited compounds present a simple antiferromagnetic configuration of axial
dipoles, and their different magnetic crystal classes allow a linear ME effect.
However, the Kerr effect is symmetry allowed in the spin ladder and forbidden
in iron tellurate. Anapoles are forbidden in iron tellurate and allowed in the
spin ladder compound, a difference evident in diffraction patterns fully
informed by symmetry. More generally, we identify a raft of Dirac multipoles,

standard techniques with beams of neutrons or x-rays tuned in energy to an iron
atomic resonance. ME invariance imposes a phase relationship between nuclear

associated to super-diffusive spreading of space-time correlation of the

Fourier's law of heat transfer and is characterised by a non-local kernel
operator which is related to fractional operators describing super-diffusion.
The kernel is essentially proportional, in appropriate scaling limit, to the
time integral of the space-time correlations of local currents in equilibrium.
In finite size systems, the time integral of correlation of microscopic
currents at different locations over infinite duration is independent of the
locations. On the other hand the kernel operator is space-dependent. We
demonstrate that the resolution of this apparent puzzle appears through taking
appropriate combination of limits of large system size and large integration

distribution-free, utilizing the specific structures of an input distribution
may improve learning performance. For example, a product distribution on a
multi-dimensional input space has a much simpler structure than a correlated
distribution. A recent paper [GHTZ21] shows that the sample complexity of a
general learning problem on product distributions is polynomial in the input
dimension, which is exponentially smaller than that on correlated
distributions. However, the learning algorithm they use is not the standard
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm. In this note, we characterize the
sample complexity of ERM in a general learning problem on product
distributions. We show that, even though product distributions are simpler than
correlated distributions, ERM still needs an exponential number of samples to
learn on product distributions, instead of a polynomial. This leads to the
conclusion that a product distribution by itself does not make a learning
problem easier -- an algorithm designed specifically for product distributions
is needed.

graph augmentation strategies have been employed to learn node representations
in a self-supervised manner. Existing methods construct the contrastive samples
by adding perturbations to the graph structure or node attributes. Although
impressive results are achieved, it is rather blind to the wealth of prior
information assumed: with the increase of the perturbation degree applied on
the original graph, 1) the similarity between the original graph and the
generated augmented graph gradually decreases; 2) the discrimination between
all nodes within each augmented view gradually increases. In this paper, we
argue that both such prior information can be incorporated (differently) into
the contrastive learning paradigm following our general ranking framework. In
particular, we first interpret CL as a special case of learning to rank (L2R),
which inspires us to leverage the ranking order among positive augmented views.
Meanwhile, we introduce a self-ranking paradigm to ensure that the
discriminative information among different nodes can be maintained and also be
less altered to the perturbations of different degrees. Experiment results on
various benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our algorithm compared
with the supervised and unsupervised models.

dilaton of the classical effective action of string theory can be imposed
without using the Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction, \ie the $D$-dimensional
effective action should be invariant under $O(D,D)$-transformations provided
that the partial derivatives along the $\beta$-parameters of the
non-geometrical elements of the $O(D,D)$-group become zero. We speculate that
the global $\beta$-symmetry may be used to find the boundary couplings when
background has boundary. In particular, we show that the Gibbons-Hawking term
at the leading order of $\alpha'$ is reproduced by this symmetry.
  At the higher orders of $\alpha'$, we speculate that the $\beta$-symmetry may
be survived only in the effective actions in which the local transformations
are deformed. In particular, we show that the invariance of the most general
standard covariant and gauge invariant bulk action at order $\alpha'$ under the
most general covariant deformed $\beta$-transformation at order $\alpha'$,
fixes both the action and the deformed $\beta$-transformation. The deformed
$\beta$-transformation, however, ruins the data at order $\alpha'$ on the
boundary, \ie the $\beta$-transformation is not a symmetry in these cases.
Using the assumption that the effective actions at the critical dimensions are
background independent, then we take the above observation as evidence that the
$\beta$-transformation is not a symmetry of the effective actions in which the
local transformations are the standard transformations. Hence, the
higher-derivative boundary couplings in the bosonic string theory and in the
type II superstring theories can not be found by the $\beta$-symmetry.

(DNNs) into two parts that run collaboratively on resource-constrained edge

protecting data privacy. However, even if the raw input data from edge devices
is not directly exposed to the cloud, state-of-the-art attacks targeting
collaborative inference are still able to reconstruct the raw private data from
the intermediate outputs of the exposed local models, introducing serious
privacy risks. In this paper, a secure privacy inference framework for
cloud-edge collaboration is proposed, termed CIS, which supports adaptively
partitioning the network according to the dynamically changing network
bandwidth and fully releases the computational power of edge devices. To
mitigate the influence introduced by private perturbation, CIS provides a way
to achieve differential privacy protection by adding refined noise to the
intermediate layer feature maps offloaded to the cloud. Meanwhile, with a given
total privacy budget, the budget is reasonably allocated by the size of the
feature graph rank generated by different convolution filters, which makes the
inference in the cloud robust to the perturbed data, thus effectively trade-off
the conflicting problem between privacy and availability. Finally, we construct
a real cloud-edge collaborative inference computing scenario to verify the
effectiveness of inference latency and model partitioning on
resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art cloud-edge
collaborative reconstruction attack is used to evaluate the practical

overfitting countermeasures, the level of incompleteness in the training set

LSTMs can struggle to learn process model structure, even with simplistic
process data and in a very lenient setup. Taking the correct anti-overfitting
measures can alleviate the problem. However, these measures did not present
themselves to be optimal when selecting hyperparameters purely on predicting
accuracy. We also found that decreasing the amount of information seen by the
LSTM during training, causes a sharp drop in generalization and precision
scores. In our experiments, we could not identify a relationship between the
extent of parallelism in the model and the generalization capability, but they

our detailed investigations, the research on the former is relatively fewer
than the latter and all the existing methods for the targeted attack follow the
same mode, i.e., the object-mislabeling mode that misleads detectors to
mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, this mode has
limited attack success rate, universal and generalization performances. In this
paper, we propose a new object-fabrication targeted attack mode which can
mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra false objects with specific target
labels. Furthermore, we design a dual attention based targeted feature space
attack method to implement the proposed targeted attack mode. The attack
performances of the proposed mode and method are evaluated on MS COCO and
BDD100K datasets using FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results demonstrate
that, the proposed object-fabrication targeted attack mode and the

and mass accommodation coefficients (TAC and MAC, respectively) for the
combination of iron(-oxide) and air. The obtained values of TAC and MAC are
then used in a point-particle Knudsen model to investigate the effect of
chemisorption and the Knudsen transition regime on the combustion behavior of
(fine) iron particles. The thermal accommodation for the interactions of
$\mathrm{Fe}$ with $\mathrm{N_2}$ and $\mathrm{Fe_xO_y}$ with $\mathrm{O_2}$ is
investigated for different surface temperatures, while the mass accommodation
coefficient for iron(-oxide) with oxygen is investigated for different initial
oxidation stages $Z_\mathrm{O}$, which represents the molar ratio of
$\mathrm{O}/\left(\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{Fe}\right)$, and different surface
temperatures. The MAC decreases fast from unity to 0.03 as $Z_\mathrm{O}$
increases from 0 to 0.5 and then diminishes as $Z_\mathrm{O}$ further increases
to 0.57. By incorporating the MD-informed accommodation coefficients into the
single iron particle combustion model,a new temperature evolution for single
iron particles is observed compared to results obtained with previously
developed continuum models. Specifically, results of the present simulations
show that the oxidation process continues after the particle reaching the peak
temperature, while previous models predicting that the maximum temperature was
attained when the particle is oxidized to $Z_\mathrm{O} = 0.5$. Since the rate
of oxidation slows down as the MAC decreases with an increasing oxidation
stage, the rate of heat loss exceeds the rate of heat release upon reaching the
maximum temperature, while the particle is not yet oxidized to $Z_\mathrm{O} =
0.5$. Finally, the effect of transition-regime heat and mass transfer on the
combustion behavior of fine iron particles is investigated and discussed.

generalizability, it also suffers from compounding errors, information
bottlenecks, and integration challenges. To overcome these challenges, a
prominent approach is to convert the AV stack into an end-to-end neural network
and train it with data. While such approaches have achieved impressive results,
they typically lack interpretability and reusability, and they eschew
principled analytical components, such as planning and control, in favor of
deep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks while
retaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack

control algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization
to produce gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as
prediction, via backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on

substantial improvements in open-loop and closed-loop planning metrics by,

architecture with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. The AE successfully
captures nonlinear features arising from gravitational dynamics and the
discreteness of the galaxy distribution. It preserves the positivity of the
reconstructed density field and exhibits a weaker suppression of the power on
small scales than the traditional linear Wiener filter (WF), which we use as a
benchmark. In the density reconstruction, the reduction of the AE MSE relative
to the WF is $\sim 15 \%$, whereas, for the velocity reconstruction, a relative
reduction of up to a factor of two can be achieved. The AE is advantageous to
the WF at recovering the distribution of the target fields, especially at the
tails. In fact, trained with an MSE loss, any NN estimate approaches the
unbiased mean of the underlying target given the input. This implies a slope of
unity in the linear regression of the true on the NN-reconstructed field. Only
for the special case of Gaussian fields, the NN and WF estimates are
equivalent. Nonetheless, we also recover a linear regression slope of unity for

To enable deployment on global scales, new classes of effective thermoelectrics

electrical conductivity, and power factor over a range of temperatures and

unbonded interlocking building blocks, are promising concepts for versatile
structural applications. They have been shown to exhibit exceptional mechanical
properties, including outstanding combinations of stiffness, strength, and
toughness, beyond those achievable with common engineering materials. Recent
work has established a theoretical upper limit for the strength and toughness
of beam-like topologically interlocked structures. However, this theoretical
limit is only achievable for structures with unrealistically high friction
coefficients; therefore, it remains unknown whether it is achievable in actual
structures. Here, we demonstrate that a hierarchical approach for topological
interlocking, inspired by biological systems, overcomes these limitations and
provides a path toward optimized mechanical performance. We consider beam-like
topologically interlocked structures that present a sinusoidal surface
morphology with controllable amplitude and wavelength and examine the
properties of the structures using numerical simulations. The results show that
the presence of surface morphologies increases the effective frictional
strength of the interfaces and, if well-designed, enables us to reach the
theoretical limit of the structural carrying capacity with realistic friction
coefficients. Furthermore, we observe that the contribution of the surface
morphology to the effective friction coefficient of the interface is well
described by a criterion combining the surface curvature and surface gradient.
Our study demonstrates the ability to architecture the surface morphology in
beam-like topological interlocked structures to significantly enhance its
structural performance.

simulation (DQS), approximating continuous-time dynamics by discrete Trotter
steps of duration $\tau$. Recent work suggested that DQS is typically
characterized by a sharp Trotter transition: when $\tau$ is increased beyond a
threshold value, approximation errors become uncontrolled at large times due to
the onset of quantum chaos. Here we contrast this picture with the case of
integrable DQS. We focus on a simple quench from a spin-wave state in the
prototypical XXZ Heisenberg spin chain, and study its integrable Trotterized
evolution as a function of $\tau$. Due to its exact local conservation laws,
the system does not heat up to infinite temperature and the late-time
properties of the dynamics are captured by a discrete Generalized Gibbs
Ensemble (dGGE). By means of exact calculations we find that, for small $\tau$,
the dGGE depends analytically on the Trotter step, implying that discretization
errors remain bounded even at infinite times. Conversely, the dGGE changes
abruptly at a threshold value $\tau_{\rm th}$, signaling a novel type of
Trotter transition. We show that the latter can be detected locally, as it is
associated with the appearance of a non-zero staggered magnetization with a
subtle dependence on $\tau$. We highlight the differences between continuous
and discrete GGEs, suggesting the latter as novel interesting nonequilibrium
states exclusive to digital platforms.

quantum computers, due to their excellent coherence and compatibility with CMOS
technology for upscaling. Advanced industrial CMOS process flows allow
wafer-scale uniformity and high device yield, but off the shelf transistor
processes cannot be directly transferred to qubit structures due to the
different designs and operation conditions. To therefore leverage the know-how
of the micro-electronics industry, we customize a 300mm wafer fabrication line
for silicon MOS qubit integration. With careful optimization and engineering of
the MOS gate stack, we report stable and uniform quantum dot operation at the
Si/SiOx interface at milli-Kelvin temperature. We extract the charge noise in
different devices and under various operation conditions, demonstrating a
record-low average noise level of 0.61 ${\mu}$eV/${\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and even
below 0.1 ${\mu}$eV/${\sqrt{Hz}}$ for some devices and operating conditions. By
statistical analysis of the charge noise with different operation and device
parameters, we show that the noise source can indeed be well described by a
two-level fluctuator model. This reproducible low noise level, in combination
with uniform operation of our quantum dots, marks CMOS manufactured MOS spin
qubits as a mature and highly scalable platform for high fidelity qubits.

  Aquatic Ecosystems",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mathematical modelling of the evolution of the size-spectrum dynamics in
aquatic ecosystems was discovered to be a powerful tool to have a deeper
insight into impacts of human- and environmental driven changes on the marine
ecosystem. In this article we propose to investigate such dynamics by
formulating and investigating a suitable model. The underlying process for
these dynamics is given by predation events, causing both growth and death of
individuals, while keeping the total biomass within the ecosystem constant. The
main governing equation investigated is deterministic and non-local of
quadratic type, coming from binary interactions. Predation is assumed to
strongly depend on the ratio between a predator and its prey, which is
distributed around a preferred feeding preference value. Existence of solutions
is shown in dependence of the choice of the feeding preference function as well
as the choice of the search exponent, a constant influencing the average volume
in water an individual has to search until it finds prey. The equation admits a
trivial steady state representing a died out ecosystem, as well as - depending
on the parameterregime - steady states with gaps in the size spectrum, giving
evidence to the well known cascade effect. The question of stability of these
equilibria is considered, showing convergence to the trivial steady state in a
certain range of parameters. These analytical observations are underlined by
numerical simulations, with additionally exhibiting convergence to the
non-trivial equilibrium for specific ranges of parameters.

stellar populations and complex star-formation histories reaching back to 250
Myr after the Big Bang. Their intense bursts of star-formation appear to be
interspersed with sustained periods of strong quenching, however the processes
underlying this evolutionary behaviour remain unclear. Unlike later epochs,
galaxies in the early Universe are not located in large associations like
clusters. Instead, they co-evolve with their developing circumgalactic halo as
relatively isolated ecosystems. Thus, the mechanisms that could bring about the
downfall of their star-formation are presumably intrinsic, and feedback
processes associated with their intense starburst episodes likely play an
important role. Cosmic rays are a viable agent to deliver this feedback, and
could account for the star-formation histories inferred for these systems. The
cosmic ray impact on galaxies may be investigated using the wealth of
multi-wavelength data soon to be obtained with the armada of new and upcoming
facilities. Complementary approaches to probe their action across the
electromagnetic spectrum can be arranged into a distance ladder of cosmic ray
feedback signatures. With a clear understanding of how cosmic ray activity in
primordial systems can be traced, it will be possible to extend this ladder to
high redshifts and map-out the role played by cosmic rays in shaping galaxy
evolution over cosmic time.

public's trust in differential privacy as a meaningful definition of privacy.
  Beyond the privacy considerations of using public data, we further question
the utility of this paradigm. We scrutinize whether existing machine learning
benchmarks are appropriate for measuring the ability of pretrained models to
generalize to sensitive domains, which may be poorly represented in public Web
data. Finally, we notice that pretraining has been especially impactful for the
largest available models -- models sufficiently large to prohibit end users
running them on their own devices. Thus, deploying such models today could be a
net loss for privacy, as it would require (private) data to be outsourced to a
more compute-powerful third party.
  We conclude by discussing potential paths forward for the field of private

The Sun acts as a cornerstone of stellar physics. Thanks to
spectroscopic, helioseismic and neutrino flux observations, we can use the Sun
as a laboratory of fundamental physics in extreme conditions. The conclusions
we draw are then used to inform and calibrate evolutionary models of all other
stars in the Universe. However, solar models are in tension with helioseismic
constraints. The debate on the ``solar problem'' has hitherto led to numerous
publications discussing potential issues with solar models and abundances.
Aims. Using the recently suggested high-metallicity abundances for the Sun, we
investigate whether standard solar models, as well as models with macroscopic
transport reproducing the solar surface lithium abundances and analyze their
properties in terms of helioseismic and neutrino flux observations. Methods. We
compute solar evolutionary models and combine spectroscopic and helioseismic
constraints as well as neutrino fluxes to investigate the impact of macroscopic
transport on these measurements. Results. When high-metallicity solar models
are calibrated to reproduce the measured solar lithium depletion, tensions
arise with respect to helioseismology and neutrino fluxes. This is yet another
demonstration that the solar problem is also linked to the physical
prescriptions of solar evolutionary models and not to chemical composition
alone. Conclusions. A revision of the physical ingredients of solar models is
needed in order to improve our understanding of stellar structure and
evolution. The solar problem is not limited to the photospheric abundances if
the depletion of light elements is considered. In addition, tighter constraints
on the solar beryllium abundance will play a key role in the improvement of
solar models.

either the bulk material or encapsulated in a bubble is shifted to energies
higher than that in the free atom. For bulk helium, the energy shifts predicted
from non-empirical electronic structure computations are in excellent agreement
with the experimentally determined values. However, there are significant
discrepancies both between the results of experiments on different bubbles and
between these and the well established descriptions of the bulk. A critique is
presented of previous attempts to determine the densities in bubbles by
measuring the intensities of the electrons inelastically scattered in STEM
experiments. The reported densities are untrustworthy because it was assumed
that the cross section for inelastic electron scattering was the same as that
of a free atom whilst it is now known that this property is greatly enhanced
for atoms confined at significant pressures.
  It is shown how experimental measurements of bubbles can be combined with
data on the bulk using a graphical method to determine whether the behavior of
an encapsulated guest differs from that in the bulk material. Experimental
electron energy loss data from an earlier study of helium encapsulated in
silicon is reanalyzed using this new method to show that the properties of the
helium in these bubbles do not differ significantly from those in the bulk
thereby enabling the densities in the bubbles to be determined. These enable
the bubble pressures to be deduced from a well established experimentally
derived equation of state. It is shown that the errors of up to 80% in the
incorrectly determined densities are greatly magnified in the predicted
pressures which can be too large by factors of over seven. This has major
practical implications for the study of radiation damage of materials exposed
to $\alpha$ particle bombardment.

suppressed. In both cases, we observe supercurrents when the two interacting
orbitals are either empty or filled with spins, or a combination. However, when
each QD hosts an unpaired spin, the supercurrent depends on the spin ground
state. It is strongly suppressed for the ring geometry with a spin-triplet
ground state at zero external magnetic field. By increasing the QD
hybridization, we find that a supercurrent appears when the ground state
changes to spin-singlet. In general, supercurrents are suppressed in cases of
spin doublet ground state, but an exception occurs at orbital degeneracy when
the system hosts one additional spin, as opposed to three, pointing to a broken
particle-hole symmetry.

possess compliance, adaptability, and delicacy. In this context, pneumatic
grippers are popular, due to provision of high deformability and compliance,
however they typically possess limited grip strength. Jamming possesses strong
grip capability, however has limited deformability and often requires the
object to be pushed onto a surface to attain a grip. This paper describes a
hybrid gripper combining pneumatics (for deformation) and jamming (for grip
strength). Our gripper utilises a torus (donut) structure with two chambers
controlled by pneumatic and vacuum pressure respectively, to conform around a
target object. The gripper displays good adaptability, exploiting pneumatics to
mould to the shape of the target object where jamming can be successfully
harnessed to grip. The main contribution of the paper is design, fabrication,
and characterisation of the first hybrid gripper that can use granular jamming
in free space, achieving significantly larger retention forces compared to pure
pneumatics. We test our gripper on a range of different sizes and shapes, as
well as picking a broad range of real fruit.

  Representation Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In contrastive self-supervised learning, the common way to learn
discriminative representation is to pull different augmented ""views"" of the
same image closer while pushing all other images further apart, which has been
proven to be effective. However, it is unavoidable to construct undesirable
views containing different semantic concepts during the augmentation procedure.
It would damage the semantic consistency of representation to pull these
augmentations closer in the feature space indiscriminately. In this study, we
introduce feature-level augmentation and propose a novel semantics-consistent
feature search (SCFS) method to mitigate this negative effect. The main idea of
SCFS is to adaptively search semantics-consistent features to enhance the
contrast between semantics-consistent regions in different augmentations. Thus,
the trained model can learn to focus on meaningful object regions, improving
the semantic representation ability. Extensive experiments conducted on
different datasets and tasks demonstrate that SCFS effectively improves the
performance of self-supervised learning and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on different downstream tasks.

(EPs) have revealed a host of unique characteristics associated with these
singularities, including unidirectional invisibility, chiral mode switching and
laser self-termination, to mention just a few examples. The vast majority of
these works focused either on passive systems or active structures where the
EPs were accessed below the lasing threshold, i.e. when the system description
is inherently linear. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that EP
singularities in coupled semiconductor nanolasers can be accessed and tracked
above the lasing threshold, where they become branch points of a nonlinear
dynamical system. Contrary to the common belief that unavoidable cavity
detuning will impede the formation of an EP, here we demonstrate that this same
detuning is necessary for compensating the carrier-induced frequency shift,
hence restoring the nonlinear EP in the lasing regime. Furthermore, unlike
linear non-Hermitian systems, we find that the spectral location of EPs above
laser threshold varies as a function of total pump power and can therefore be
continuously tracked. Our work is a first step towards the realization of
lasing EPs in more complex laser geometries, and enabling the enhancement of
photonic local density of states through non-Hermitian symmetries combined with
nonlinear interactions in coupled laser arrays.

frost-exposed environments. Gas bubbles are formed during freezing, when the
low chemical potential of the ice reaches a critical cavitation threshold and
expand during thawing. However, when water freezes, its volume increases by 9%,
generating local pressures, which can limit the formation of bubbles. To
characterize local dynamic of pressure-tension and physical state of the sap
during freeze-thaw cycles, we simultaneously used ultrasonic acoustic emissions
analysis and synchrotron-based High Resolution Computed Tomography on the
diffuse-porous species Betula pendula. Visualization of individual air-filled
vessels was performed to measure freeze-thaw induced embolism after successive
freeze-thaw cycles down to -10C or -20C during the leafy and the leafless
periods. We also measured the distribution of gas bubbles and made additional
continuous monitoring of embolism spreading using a dedicated cooling system
that allowed X-ray scanning during freezing and thawing. Experiments confirmed
that ultrasonic emissions occurred after the onset of ice formation, together
with bubble formation, whereas the development of embolism took place after
thawing in all cases. The pictures of frozen tissues indicated that upon
freezing the balance between negative pressure generated by the low water
potential of the ice and the positive pressure induced by the volumetric
increase of ice can provoke inward flow from the cell wall toward the lumen of
the vessels. We found no evidence that wider vessels within a tissue were more
prone to embolism although the occurrence of gas bubbles in larger conduits
would make them prone to earlier embolism. These results highlight the need to
monitor local pressure as well as ice and air distribution during xylem
freezing to understand the mechanism leading to frost-induced embolism.

to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in higher orders in WKB, but we present the

it has logarithmic corrections, and polynomials of logarithms of the black hole

social dilemmas in many natural or social systems. Generally, the environmental
changes include two prominent aspects: the global time-dependent fluctuations
and the local strategy-dependent feedbacks. However, the impacts of these two
types of environmental changes have only been studied separately, a complete
picture of the environmental effects exerted by the combination of these two
aspects remains unclear. Here we develop a theoretical framework that
integrates group strategic behaviors with their general dynamic environments,
where the global environmental fluctuations are associated with a nonlinear
factor in public goods game and the local environmental feedbacks are described
by the `eco-evolutionary game'. We show how the coupled dynamics of local
game-environment evolution differs in static and dynamic global environments.
In particular, we find the emergence of cyclic evolutions of group cooperation
and local environment, which forms an interior irregular loop in the phase
plane, depending on the relative changing speed of both global and local
environments compared to the strategic change. Our results provide important
insights toward how diverse evolutionary outcomes could emerge from the
nonlinear interactions between strategies and the changing environments.

in soft jamming grippers can improve holding strength. In a series of studies,
we show that frequency and amplitude of the waveforms are key determinants to
performance, and that jamming performance is also dependent on temporal

on active vibrational control of jamming in soft robotics to improve

effect due to the low generated photocurrents. Here, we show that a remarkably
high photoresponse can be achieved by exploiting the BPE in simple planar
BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) films, solely by tuning their fundamental ferroelectric
properties via strain and growth orientation induced by epitaxial growth on
different substrates. We find a non-monotonic dependence of the responsivity

high BPE coefficient ($\beta$) of $\approx$10$^{-2}$ 1/V, which to the best of
our knowledge is the highest reported to date for standard planar BTO thin

data samples, increasing the model's reliability. Recent works have developed
DL-based OOD detection that achieves promising results on 2D medical images.
However, scaling most of these approaches on 3D images is computationally
intractable. Furthermore, the current 3D solutions struggle to achieve
acceptable results in detecting even synthetic OOD samples. Such limited
performance might indicate that DL often inefficiently embeds large volumetric
images. We argue that using the intensity histogram of the original CT or MRI
scan as embedding is descriptive enough to run OOD detection. Therefore, we
propose a histogram-based method that requires no DL and achieves almost
perfect results in this domain. Our proposal is supported two-fold. We evaluate
the performance on the publicly available datasets, where our method scores 1.0
AUROC in most setups. And we score second in the Medical Out-of-Distribution

discussing the limitations, we conclude that our method solves the sample-level

is not straightforward and frequently tracer particles are employed. Tracer
particles may be tracked in situ during the simulation, but often they are
reconstructed in a post-processing step based on the information saved during
the hydrodynamics simulation. Reconstruction can be done in a number of ways
and here we compare the approaches of backward and forward integration of the
equations of motion to the results based on inline particle trajectories. We
find that both methods agree reasonably well with the inline results for
isotopes for which a large number of particles contribute. However, for rarer
isotopes that are produced only by a small number of particle trajectories,
deviations can be large. For our setup, we find that backward integration leads
to a better agreement with the inline particles by more accurately reproducing
the conditions following freeze-out from nuclear statistical equilibrium,
because the establishment of nuclear statistical equilibrium erases the need
for detailed trajectories at earlier times. Based on our results, if inline
tracers are unavailable, we recommend backward reconstruction, to the point
when nuclear statistical equilibrium last applied, with an interval between
simulation snapshots of at most 1 ms for nucleosynthesis post-processing.

unprecedented success, they still suffer from two major limitations. First,
most of them deteriorate when facing complex degradations out of their training
data. Second, these methods require multiple constraints, e.g., fidelity,
perceptual, and adversarial losses, which require laborious hyper-parameter
tuning to stabilize and balance their influences. In this work, we propose a
novel method named DifFace that is capable of coping with unseen and complex
degradations more gracefully without complicated loss designs. The key of our
method is to establish a posterior distribution from the observed low-quality
(LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) counterpart. In particular, we design a
transition distribution from the LQ image to the intermediate state of a
pre-trained diffusion model and then gradually transmit from this intermediate
state to the HQ target by recursively applying a pre-trained diffusion model.
The transition distribution only relies on a restoration backbone that is
trained with $L_2$ loss on some synthetic data, which favorably avoids the
cumbersome training process in existing methods. Moreover, the transition
distribution can contract the error of the restoration backbone and thus makes
our method more robust to unknown degradations. Comprehensive experiments show
that DifFace is superior to current state-of-the-art methods, especially in
cases with severe degradations. Code and model are available at

most important means to estimate patient prognosis. Although many
weakly-supervised deep learning models have been developed for gigapixel WSIs,
their potential is generally restricted by classical survival analysis rules
and fully-supervised learning requirements. As a result, these models provide
patients only with a completely-certain point estimation of time-to-event, and
they could only learn from the labeled WSI data currently at a small scale. To
tackle these problems, we propose a novel adversarial multiple instance
learning (AdvMIL) framework. This framework is based on adversarial
time-to-event modeling, and integrates the multiple instance learning (MIL)
that is much necessary for WSI representation learning. It is a plug-and-play
one, so that most existing MIL-based end-to-end methods can be easily upgraded
by applying this framework, gaining the improved abilities of survival
distribution estimation and semi-supervised learning. Our extensive experiments
show that AdvMIL not only could often bring performance improvement to
mainstream WSI survival analysis methods at a relatively low computational
cost, but also enables these methods to effectively utilize unlabeled data via
semi-supervised learning. Moreover, it is observed that AdvMIL could help
improving the robustness of models against patch occlusion and two
representative image noises. The proposed AdvMIL framework could promote the

is performed for the physical conditions of cool stellar atmospheres typical of
red giants (log g = 2.0, Teff = 4500 K) and the Sun. The aim of the present
work is to explore whether the G-band of the CH molecule, which is commonly
used in abundance diagnostics of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, is
sensitive to NLTE effects. LTE and NLTE theoretical spectra are computed with
the MULTI code. We use one-dimensional (1D) LTE hydrostatic MARCS model
atmospheres with parameters representing eleven red giant stars with
metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -4.0 to [Fe/H] = 0.0 and carbon-to-iron
ratios [C/Fe] = 0.0, +0.7, +1.5, and +3.0. The CH molecule model is represented
by 1981 energy levels, 18377 radiative bound-bound transitions, and 932
photo-dissociation reactions. The rates due to transitions caused by collisions
with free electrons and hydrogen atoms are computed using classical recipes.
Our calculations suggest that NLTE effects in the statistical equilibrium of
the CH molecule are significant and cannot be neglected for precision
spectroscopic analysis of C abundances. The NLTE effects in the G-band increase
with decreasing metallicity. We show that the C abundances are always
under-estimated if LTE is assumed. The NLTE corrections to C abundance inferred
from the CH feature range from +0.04 dex for the Sun to +0.21 dex for a red
giant with metallicity [Fe/H] = -4.0. Departures from the LTE assumption in the
CH molecule are non-negligible and NLTE effects have to be taken into account
in the diagnostic spectroscopy based on the CH lines. We show here that the
NLTE effects in the optical CH lines are non-negligible for the Sun and red
giant stars, but further calculations are warranted to investigate the effects
in other regimes of stellar parameters.

(MPC), for the optimal guidance of a launch vehicle upper stage. The proposed
strategy not only maximizes the performance of the vehicle and its robustness
to external disturbances, but also robustly enforces the splash-down
constraint. Indeed, uncertainty on the engine performance, and in particular on
the burn time, could lead to a large footprint of possible impact points, which
may pose a concern if the reentry points are close to inhabited regions. Thus,
the proposed guidance strategy incorporates a neutral axis maneuver (NAM) that
minimizes the sensitivity of the impact point to uncertain engine performance.
Unlike traditional methods to design a NAM, which are particularly burdensome
and require long validation and verification tasks, the presented MPC algorithm
autonomously determines the neutral axis direction by repeatedly solving an
optimal control problem (OCP) with two return phases, a nominal and a perturbed
one, constrained to the same splash-down point. The OCP is transcribed as a
sequence of convex problems that quickly converges to the optimal solution,
thus allowing for high MPC update frequencies. Numerical results assess the
robustness and performance of the proposed algorithm via extensive Monte Carlo
campaigns.

the data scarcity problem in NER by automatically generating training samples.
Unfortunately, the distant supervision may induce noisy labels, thus
undermining the robustness of the learned models and restricting the practical
application. To relieve this problem, recent works adopt self-training
teacher-student frameworks to gradually refine the training labels and improve
the generalization ability of NER models. However, we argue that the
performance of the current self-training frameworks for DS-NER is severely
underestimated by their plain designs, including both inadequate student
learning and coarse-grained teacher updating. Therefore, in this paper, we make
the first attempt to alleviate these issues by proposing: (1) adaptive teacher
learning comprised of joint training of two teacher-student networks and
considering both consistent and inconsistent predictions between two teachers,
thus promoting comprehensive student learning. (2) fine-grained student
ensemble that updates each fragment of the teacher model with a temporal moving
average of the corresponding fragment of the student, which enhances consistent
predictions on each model fragment against noise. To verify the effectiveness
of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on four DS-NER datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses

drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Resection may involve large
amounts of cortical tissue. Here, we examine the effects of this surgery on
cortical morphology measured in independent variables both near the resection
and remotely.
  We studied 101 individuals with TLE (55 left, 46 right onset) who underwent
ATLR. For each individual we considered one pre-surgical MRI and one follow-up
MRI 2 to 13 months after surgery. We used our newly developed surface-based
method to locally compute traditional morphological variables (average cortical
thickness, exposed surface area, and total surface area), and the independent
measures $K$, $I$, and $S$, where $K$ measures white matter tension, $I$
captures isometric scaling, and $S$ contains the remaining information about
cortical shape. Data from 924 healthy controls was included to account for
healthy ageing effects occurring during scans. A SurfStat random field theory
clustering approach assessed changes across the cortex caused by ATLR.
  Compared to preoperative data, surgery had marked effects on all
morphological measures. Ipsilateral effects were located in the orbitofrontal
and inferior frontal gyri, the pre- and postcentral gyri and supramarginal
gyrus, and the lateral occipital gyrus and lingual cortex. Contralateral
effects were in the lateral occipital gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus and
frontal pole.
  The restructuring following ATLR is reflected in widespread morphological
changes, mainly in regions near the resection, but also remotely in regions
that are structurally connected to the anterior temporal lobe. The causes could
include mechanical effects, Wallerian degeneration, or compensatory plasticity.
The study of independent measures revealed additional effects compared to
traditional measures.

validation and certification of the safety and robustness of neural network
(NN) controllers against various uncertainties including unmodelled dynamics,
non-linearities, and time delays. One way in providing such validation
guarantees is to maintain the closed-loop system output with a NN controller
when its input changes within a bounded set, close to the output of a robustly
performing closed-loop reference model. This paper presents a novel approach to
analysing the performance and robustness of uncertain feedback systems with NN
controllers. Due to the complexity of analysing such systems, the problem is
reformulated as the problem of dynamical tracking errors between the
closed-loop system with a neural controller and an ideal closed-loop reference
model. Then, the approximation of the controller error is characterised by
adopting the differential mean value theorem (DMV) and the Integral Quadratic
Constraints (IQCs) technique. Moreover, the Relative Integral Square Error
(RISE) and the Supreme Square Error (SSE) bounded set are derived for the
output of the error dynamical system. The analysis is then performed by
integrating Lyapunov theory with the IQCs-based technique. The resulting
worst-case analysis provides the user a prior knowledge about the worst case of
RISE and SSE between the reference closed-loop model and the uncertain system
controlled by the neural controller. The suitability of the proposed technique
is demonstrated by the results obtained on a nonlinear single-link robot system
with a NN trained to control the movement of this mechanical system while
keeping close to an ideal closed-loop reference model.

studying the $J/\psi J/\psi $ and $J/\psi \psi^\prime$ invariant mass
distributions for the potential quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ or $2^{++}$ by
considering both the coherence and incoherence with the background
contribution. All these frameworks can describe the experimental data very
well, however with different pole structures. For instance, in the case of
$2^{++}$ description of these structures, there always exists a pole slightly
below the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold. For the $0^{++}$ case, a similar pole can
also be found below the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold however with a much lower

For the $0^{++}$ ($2^{++}$) case, the peak structure around $7.2~\gev$ can

data with varying length patterns. However, when using artificial neural
networks (ANN), it is standard practice to use fixed-sized mini-batches. To do
this, time series data with varying lengths are typically normalized so that
all the patterns are the same length. Normally, this is done using zero padding
or truncation without much consideration. We propose a novel method of
normalizing the lengths of the time series in a dataset by exploiting the
dynamic matching ability of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In this way, the time
series lengths in a dataset can be set to a fixed size while maintaining
features typical to the dataset. In the experiments, all 11 datasets with
varying length time series from the 2018 UCR Time Series Archive are used. We
evaluate the proposed method by comparing it with 18 other length normalization
methods on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Long-Short Term Memory
network (LSTM), and a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM).

desired functionalities and engineer their properties precisely. This requires
deeper understanding of if the properties of building blocks e.g. single
molecules can be translated to many molecule junctions in the form of
self-assembled monolayers (SAM). Therefore, understanding the effect of
intermolecular interaction becomes important. In this paper, we study the
effect of intermolecular interactions on the charge transport and
thermoelectric properties of junctions formed by parallel molecules between
metallic electrodes. We demonstrate that the electrical conductance and Seebeck
coefficient are enhanced simultaneously leading to more than an order of
magnitude enhancement of power factor as a result of intermolecular coupling
between two molecules of the same kind or different. This strategy can be used
to improve the thermoelectric performance of SAMs by engineering their packing

analysing media coverage regarding ESG factors is challenging since (1) the

necessarily deal with an ESG-relevant topic, meaning that it must be carefully
filtered, and (3) the majority of media coverage data is unstructured. Research
Goal: We aim to extract ESG-relevant information from textual media reactions
automatically to calculate an ESG score for a given company. Our goal is to
reduce the cost of ESG data collection and make ESG information available to
the general public. Contribution: Our contributions are three-fold: First, we

computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an $n$-point
set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In the streaming model, the points in $X$ can be
added and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in
small space. In low dimensions, $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG '05]. However, for high
dimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was
$\tilde{O}(\log n)$, due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC '22],
improving on the prior $O(\log^2 n)$ bound due to [Indyk, STOC '04] and
[Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA '08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic
barrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to
Euclidean MST. For any $\epsilon\geq 1$, our algorithm achieves an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ approximation in $n^{O(\epsilon)}$ space.
  We complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a
better than $1.10$-approximation must use $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space,
demonstrating that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are not possible in
high-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant.
Nevertheless, we demonstrate that $(1+\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in
sublinear space with $O(1/\epsilon)$ passes over the stream. More generally,
for any $\alpha \geq 2$, we give a $\alpha$-pass streaming algorithm which
achieves a $(1+O(\frac{\log \alpha + 1}{ \alpha \epsilon}))$ approximation in
$n^{O(\epsilon)} d^{O(1)}$ space. Our streaming algorithms are linear sketches,
and therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC). Thus,
our results imply the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to Euclidean MST in a
constant number of rounds in the MPC model.

  Communication",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using artificial intelligent (AI) to re-design and enhance the current
wireless communication system is a promising pathway for the future
sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. The performance of AI-enabled wireless
communication depends heavily on the quality of wireless air-interface data.
Although there are various approaches to data quality assessment (DQA) for
different applications, none has been designed for wireless air-interface data.
In this paper, we propose a DQA framework to measure the quality of wireless
air-interface data from three aspects: similarity, diversity, and completeness.
The similarity measures how close the considered datasets are in terms of their
statistical distributions; the diversity measures how well-rounded a dataset
is, while the completeness measures to what degree the considered dataset
satisfies the required performance metrics in an application scenario. The
proposed framework can be applied to various types of wireless air-interface
data, such as channel state information (CSI),
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), reference signal received power
(RSRP), etc. For simplicity, the validity of our proposed DQA framework is
corroborated by applying it to CSI data and using similarity and diversity
metrics to improve CSI compression and recovery in Massive MIMO systems.

the standard shape in many recent shell-buckling studies, whereas the latter

were validated previously against experiments, to compute the knockdown factors
for the two cases while systematically exploring the parameter space of the

the defect, we find that shells containing bumpy defects consistently exhibit
significantly higher knockdown factors than shells with the more classic
dimpled defects. Furthermore, the relationship of the knockdown as a function
of the amplitude and width of the defect is qualitatively different between the
two cases, which also exhibit distinct post-buckling behavior. A speculative
interpretation of the results is provided based on the qualitative differences
in the mean-curvature profiles of the two cases.

the loop and the resulting metachronal wave speed. Numerical integrations of
stochastic directional phase oscillator models show that even a weak level of

transmit their data simultaneously, the gateway leverages a new multi-packet
reception (MPR) approach to compute aggregate data from the phase-asynchronous
superimposed signal. Different from the analog approach which requires
additional power synchronization and phase synchronization, our MRP-based
digital approach is compatible with commercial LoRa nodes and is more reliable.
Different from traditional MPR approaches that are designed for the collision
decoding scenario, our new MPR approach allows simultaneous transmissions with
small packet arrival time offsets, and addresses a new co-located peak problem
through the following components: 1) an improved channel and offset estimation
algorithm that enables accurate phase tracking in each symbol, 2) a new symbol
demodulation algorithm that finds the maximum likelihood sequence of nodes'
data, and 3) a soft-decision packet decoding algorithm that utilizes the
likelihoods of several sequences to improve decoding performance. Trace-driven
simulation results show that the symbol demodulation algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art MPR decoder by 5.3$\times$ in terms of physical-layer
throughput, and the soft decoder is more robust to unavoidable adverse phase
misalignment and estimation error in practice. Moreover, LoRaPDA outperforms
the state-of-the-art MPR scheme by at least 2.1$\times$ for all SNRs in terms

The details of cosmic-ray transport have a strong impact on galaxy
evolution. The peak of the cosmic-ray energy distribution is observable in the
radio continuum using the electrons as proxy. Aims. We measure the length that
the cosmic-ray electrons (CRE) are transported during their lifetime in the
nearby galaxy M 51 across one order of magnitude in cosmic-ray energy
(approximately 1-10 GeV). To this end we use new ultra-low frequency
observations from the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) at 54 MHz and ancillary data
between 144 and 8350 MHz. Methods. As the the CRE originate from supernova
remnants, the radio maps are smoothed in comparison to the distribution of the
star formation. By convolving the map of the star-formation rate (SFR) surface
density with a Gaussian kernel, we can linearise the radio-SFR relation. The
best-fitting convolution kernel is then our estimate of the CRE transport
length. Results. We find that the CRE transport length increases at low
frequencies, as expected since the CRE have longer lifetimes. The CRE transport
length is $l_{\rm CRE} = \sqrt{4Dt_{\rm syn}}$, where $D$ is the isotropic
diffusion coefficient and $t_{\rm syn}$ is the CRE lifetime as given by
synchrotron and inverse Compton losses. We find that the data can be well
fitted by diffusion, where $D=(2.14\pm 0.13) \times 10^{28}~\rm cm^2\,s^{-1}$.
With $D\propto E^{0.001\pm 0.185}$, the diffusion coefficient is independent of
the CRE energy $E$ in the range considered. Conclusions. Our results suggest
that the transport of GeV-cosmic ray electrons in the star-forming discs of
galaxies is governed by energy-independent diffusion.

from charm-quark hadronisation (prompt) and from beauty-meson decays
(non-prompt) in hadron collisions. The measurements were performed at
midrapidity ($|y|<0.8$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in
proton-proton (pp) collisions collected by ALICE at the centre-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The diagonal spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ of
${\rm D^{*+}}$ mesons was measured from the angular distribution of the ${\rm
D^{*+}} \to {\rm D}^0 (\to {\rm K}^{-}\pi^{+}) \pi^+$ decay products, in the
${\rm D^{*+}}$ rest frame, with respect to the ${\rm D^{*+}}$ momentum
direction in the pp centre of mass frame. The $\rho_{00}$ value for prompt
${\rm D^{*+}}$ mesons is consistent with $1/3$, which implies no spin
alignment. However, for non-prompt ${\rm D^{*+}}$ mesons an evidence of
$\rho_{00}$ larger than $1/3$ is found. The measured value of the spin density
element is $\rho_{00}=0.455\pm0.022(\text{stat.})\pm0.035(\text{syst.})$ in the
$5 < p_{\rm T} < 20$ GeV/$c$ interval, which is consistent with a PYTHIA 8
Monte Carlo simulation coupled with the EVTGEN package, which implements the
helicity conservation in the decay of ${\rm D^{*+}}$ meson from beauty mesons.
In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the spin of the ${\rm D^{*+}}$ mesons may
be globally aligned with the direction of the initial angular momentum and
magnetic field. Based on the results for pp collisions reported in this letter
it is shown that alignment of non-prompt ${\rm D^{*+}}$ mesons due to the
helicity conservation coupled to the collective anisotropic expansion may mimic
the signal of global spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions.

phase transition is fast and strong. The critical, nucleation and percolation
temperatures of the phase transition are close to each other in the holographic
model. In addition, the velocity $v_w$ is found to be less than the sound speed
of the plasma $c_{s}=1/\sqrt{3}$, which corresponds to the deflagration
scenario. For QCD phase transition, the gravitational wave power spectrum can
reach $10^{-13}-10^{-14}$ around the peak frequency of 0.01 Hz, which can be
detected by BBO and Ultimate-DECIGO. For electroweak phase transition, the
gravitational wave power spectrum can reach $10^{-12}-10^{-16}$ around the peak
frequency $1-10$ Hz. Moreover, the primordial black hole is not favorable for
formation due to the large parameter $\beta/H$ and small velocity $v_w$.

framework has shown great potential in various vision tasks. However, the
pre-training computational budget is too heavy and withholds the MIM from
becoming a practical training paradigm. This paper presents FastMIM, a simple
and generic framework for expediting masked image modeling with the following
two steps: (i) pre-training vision backbones with low-resolution input images;
and (ii) reconstructing Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature instead
of original RGB values of the input images. In addition, we propose FastMIM-P
to progressively enlarge the input resolution during pre-training stage to
further enhance the transfer results of models with high capacity. We point out
that: (i) a wide range of input resolutions in pre-training phase can lead to
similar performances in fine-tuning phase and downstream tasks such as
detection and segmentation; (ii) the shallow layers of encoder are more
important during pre-training and discarding last several layers can speed up
the training stage with no harm to fine-tuning performance; (iii) the decoder
should match the size of selected network; and (iv) HOG is more stable than RGB
values when resolution transfers;. Equipped with FastMIM, all kinds of vision
backbones can be pre-trained in an efficient way. For example, we can achieve
83.8%/84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/Swin-B as backbones.
Compared to previous relevant approaches, we can achieve comparable or better
top-1 accuracy while accelerate the training procedure by $\sim$5$\times$. Code

be the first application of the boundary element method (BEM) where each BEM
basis function is supported in a fractal set, and the integration involved in
the formation of the BEM matrix is with respect to a non-integer order
Hausdorff measure rather than the usual (Lebesgue) surface measure. Using
recent results on function spaces on fractals, we prove convergence of the
Galerkin formulation of this ``Hausdorff BEM'' for acoustic scattering in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ ($n=1,2$) when the scatterer, assumed to be a compact subset
of $\mathbb{R}^n\times\{0\}$, is a $d$-set for some $d\in (n-1,n]$, so that, in
particular, the scatterer has Hausdorff dimension $d$. For a class of fractals
that are attractors of iterated function systems, we prove convergence rates
for the Hausdorff BEM and superconvergence for smooth antilinear functionals,
under certain natural regularity assumptions on the solution of the underlying
boundary integral equation. We also propose numerical quadrature routines for
the implementation of our Hausdorff BEM, along with a fully discrete
convergence analysis, via numerical (Hausdorff measure) integration estimates

Finally, we show numerical experiments that support the sharpness of our

focused on the location of patches, overlooking the scene structure of images.
Thus, we aim to further guide the interaction of patches using the object
information. Specifically, we propose OAMixer (object-aware mixing layer),
which calibrates the patch mixing layers of patch-based models based on the
object labels. Here, we obtain the object labels in unsupervised or
weakly-supervised manners, i.e., no additional human-annotating cost is
necessary. Using the object labels, OAMixer computes a reweighting mask with a
learnable scale parameter that intensifies the interaction of patches
containing similar objects and applies the mask to the patch mixing layers. By
learning an object-centric representation, we demonstrate that OAMixer improves
the classification accuracy and background robustness of various patch-based

translucent polarization filter to the emission coming from beyond its domains.
This underlines the importance of studying the Local Bubble in detail, as it is

qualitatively in agreement, at low and middle latitudes (|b|<60 deg), with the

in agreement with current models of the magnetic field structure in the Local

patterns observed by Planck toward the polar Galactic caps. This may be due to
the advanced stage of evolution of the candidate bubble and to the limited
simulation domain. Finally, we show that from our synthetic polarization maps,
it is difficult to distinguish between an open and a closed Galactic cap using

discuss whether this programme is jeopardised by the uncertainties on the

detail the motivated assumptions under which the astrophysical foregrounds can
be assumed to be known in shape, and only uncertain in their normalisation. In
this case, the sensitivity to a primordial signal can be computed by a simple
and numerically agile procedure, where the optimal filter function subtracts
the components of the astrophysical foreground that are close in spectral shape
to the signal. We show that the degradation of the sensitivity to the signal in
presence of astrophysical foregrounds is limited to a factor of a few, and only
around the frequencies where the signal is closer to the foregrounds. Our
results highlight the importance of modelling the contributions of eccentric or
intermediate-mass black hole binaries to the GW background, to consolidate the
prospects to perform precision cosmology with primordial GW backgrounds.

for concern given the absence of standardized authorization in the OpenAPI
standard, improper authorization opens the possibility for known and unknown
vulnerabilities, which in the past years have been exploited by malicious
actors resulting in data loss. This paper examines the number one vulnerability
in API Security: Broken Object Level Authorization(BOLA), and proposes methods
and tools to reduce the prevalence of this vulnerability. BOLA affects various
API frameworks, our scope is fixated on the OpenAPI Specification(OAS). The OAS
is a standard for describing and implementing APIs; popular OAS Implementations
are FastAPI, Connexion (Flask), and many more. These implementations carry the
pros and cons that are associated with the OASs knowledge of API properties.
The Open API Specifications security properties do not address object
authorization and provide no standardized approach to define such object
properties. This leaves object-level security at the mercy of developers, which
presents an increased risk of unintentionally creating attack vectors. Our aim
is to tackle this void by introducing 1) the OAS ESS (OpenAPI Specification
Extended Security Scheme) which includes declarative security controls for
objects in OAS (design-based approach), and 2) an authorization module that can
be imported to API services (Flask/FastAPI) to enforce authorization checks at
the object level (development-based approach). When building an API service, a
developer can start with the API design (specification) or its code. In both
cases, a set of mechanisms are introduced to help developers mitigate and
reduce the prevalence of BOLA.

Cahn--Hilliard equation for the phase-field variable, and an
advection-diffusion equation for the density of certain chemical substance.
This system is thermodynamically consistent and generalizes the well-known
``Model H"" for viscous incompressible binary fluids. For the initial-boundary
value problem with a physically relevant logarithmic type potential in a
general bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, we first prove the
existence and uniqueness of a local strong solution. When the initial velocity
is small and the initial phase-field function as well as the initial chemical
density are small perturbations of a local minimizer of the free energy, we
establish the existence of a unique global strong solution. Afterwards, we show
the uniqueness of asymptotic limit for any global strong solution as time goes
to infinity and provide an estimate on the convergence rate. The proofs for
global well-posedness and long-time behavior are based on the system's
dissipative structure and the {\L}ojasiewicz--Simon approach. Our analysis

based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and
quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text
and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement
structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to
make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from
grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete
algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of
parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum
algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the
meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.
  The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy
(Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory
of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are
the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a
high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical
structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or
arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract
diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific
libraries.
  The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised
functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept
for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine
learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In
order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce
the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing
the gradients of parameterised diagrams.

investigated by considering the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with flavor-dependent
coupling constants that were derived by considering (non-perturbative) gluon
exchange.The strange quark effective mass ($M_s^*$) is varied such that the
strangeness content of these scalar mesons can be analyzed further. The neutral
states $S_0$, $S_8$ and $S_3$, are adopted as the most relevant quark-antiquark
components respectively of the $\sigma(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $A_0^0(980)$
mesons. As a result, the mass hierarchy between states $S_0$ and $S_8$, and
$K^*_0(700) - A_0(980)$ mesons, can be respectively inverted and corrected for
quite low values of the strange quark constituent mass. Besides that, for some
particular values of $M_s^*$, the masses of $\sigma(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ can
also be obtained by considering the mixing coupling constant $G_{08}$. However,
the masses of all the nine mesons are not described simultaneously in a
self-consistent procedure and this goes along with the need of
non-quark-antiquark states to completely describe their masses. A neutral-meson
mixing matrix is defined and the leading mixing angle is found by fitting a
correct value of the $\sigma(500)$-$f_0(980)$ mass difference. Two different
estimates for the strengths of the mixings $A_0^0 \to f_0$ and $f_0 \to A_0^0$
are proposed, leading to somewhat different behaviors. Firstly, by assuming
leading transitions to intermediary flavor eigenstates and secondly by
considering a dynamical evolution. Results may be in good agreement with
experimental values from BESS-III depending on the value of the strange quark
effective mass.

data into meaningful components and are therefore appreciated for their
particular advantages in interpretability. Recent algorithms often combine
machine learning (hereafter ML) methodology with decomposition to improve
prediction accuracy. However, incorporating ML is generally considered to
sacrifice interpretability inevitably. In addition, existing hybrid algorithms
usually rely on theoretical models with statistical assumptions and focus only
on the accuracy of aggregate predictions, and thus suffer from accuracy
problems, especially in component estimates. In response to the above issues,
this research explores the possibility of improving accuracy without losing
interpretability in time series forecasting. We first quantitatively define
interpretability for data-driven forecasts and systematically review the
existing forecasting algorithms from the perspective of interpretability.
Accordingly, we propose the W-R algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines
decomposition and ML from a novel perspective. Specifically, the W-R algorithm
replaces the standard additive combination function with a weighted variant and
uses ML to modify the estimates of all components simultaneously. We
mathematically analyze the theoretical basis of the algorithm and validate its
performance through extensive numerical experiments. In general, the W-R
algorithm outperforms all decomposition-based and ML benchmarks. Based on
P50_QL, the algorithm relatively improves by 8.76% in accuracy on the practical
sales forecasts of JD.com and 77.99% on a public dataset of electricity loads.
This research offers an innovative perspective to combine the statistical and
ML algorithms, and JD.com has implemented the W-R algorithm to make accurate
sales predictions and guide its marketing activities.

the epipolar line: this guarantees an even scanning of the image space and
avoids both the need to select a depth range of interest, which is often not
known a priori and can vary dramatically from scene to scene, and the need for
a suitable discretization of the depth space. In fact, our search is iterative,
which avoids the building of a cost volume, costly both to store and to

Its velocity obeys a scaling law in terms of the combined interaction and

We identify a single RG stable fixed point whose basin of attraction is the set
of rational numbers, associate periodic RG orbits with (pure) quadratic
irrationals and aperiodic RG orbits with (non-mixing) families of non-quadratic
algebraic irrationals and trascendental numbers. Finally, we show that the

Existing works mostly address optimization with homogeneous AoI requirements,
which is different from practice. In this work, we optimize uplink scheduling
for an access point (AP) over multiple unknown channels with heterogeneous AoI
requirements defined by AoI-dependent costs. The AP serves $N$ users by using
$M$ channels without the channel state information. Each channel serves only
one user in each decision epoch. The optimization objective is to minimize the
time-averaged AoI-dependent costs plus additional communication transmission
costs over an infinite horizon. This decision-making problem can be formulated
as a Markov decision process, but it is computationally intractable because the
size of the state space grows exponentially with respect to the number of
users. To alleviate the challenge, we reformulate the problem as a variant of
the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem and leverage Whittle's index
theory to design an index-based scheduling policy algorithm. We derive an
analytic formula for the indices, which reduces the computational overhead and
facilitates online adaptation. Our numerical examples show that our index-based
scheduling policy achieves comparable performance to the optimal policy and
outperforms several other heuristics.

eventually evolve into JFCs should leave the Centaur population through this
gateway. This may be naively interpreted as gateway Centaurs being pristine
progenitors of JFCs. This is the point we want to address in this work. We show
that the opposite is true: gateway Centaurs are, on average, more thermally
processed than the rest of the population of Centaurs crossing Jupiter's orbit.
Using a dynamically-validated JFC population, we find that only $\sim 20\%$ of
Centaurs pass through the gateway prior to becoming JFCs, in accordance with
previous studies. We show that more than half of JFC dynamical clones entering
the gateway for the first time have already been JFCs -they simply avoided the
gateway on their first pass into the inner solar system. By coupling a thermal
evolution model to the orbital evolution of JFC dynamical clones, we find a
higher than 50\% chance that the layer currently contributing to the observed
activity of gateway objects has been physically and chemically altered, due to
previously sustained thermal processing. We further illustrate this effect by
examining dynamical clones that match the present-day orbits of

characterized a large body of quantum circuits by extracting graph theory-based

even with balanced datasets that lack group/label associations. We show how
difficulty disparity is a model-dependent quantity, and is further amplified in
commonly-used models as selected by typical average performance scores. We
quantify an amplification factor across a range of settings in order to compare
disparity of different models on a fixed dataset. Finally, we present two
real-world examples of difficulty amplification in action, resulting in
worse-than-expected performance disparities between groups even when using a

demonstrates that merely balancing sample sizes of groups is not sufficient to

approach is pseudo-labeling that generates pseudo labels only for those
unlabeled data with high-confidence predictions. As for the low-confidence
ones, existing methods often simply discard them because these unreliable
pseudo labels may mislead the model. Nevertheless, we highlight that these data
with low-confidence pseudo labels can be still beneficial to the training
process. Specifically, although the class with the highest probability in the
prediction is unreliable, we can assume that this sample is very unlikely to
belong to the classes with the lowest probabilities. In this way, these data
can be also very informative if we can effectively exploit these complementary
labels, i.e., the classes that a sample does not belong to. Inspired by this,
we propose a novel Contrastive Complementary Labeling (CCL) method that
constructs a large number of reliable negative pairs based on the complementary
labels and adopts contrastive learning to make use of all the unlabeled data.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL significantly improves the
performance on top of existing methods. More critically, our CCL is
particularly effective under the label-scarce settings. For example, we yield
an improvement of 2.43% over FixMatch on CIFAR-10 only with 40 labeled data.

DR-submodular function maximization, e.g., the double greedy algorithm has a

component of space weather. Thus, understanding the physical processes at play
in flares is vital. That understanding often requires the use of forward
modelling in order to predict the hydrodynamic and radiative response of the
solar atmosphere. Those predictions must then be critiqued by observations to
show us where our models are missing ingredients. While flares are of course 3D
phenomenon, simulating the flaring atmosphere including an accurate
chromosphere with the required spatial scales in 3D is largely beyond current
computational capabilities, and certainly performing parameter studies of
energy transport mechanisms is not yet tractable in 3D. Therefore,
field-aligned 1D loop models that can resolve the relevant scales have a

IRIS, (2) how those observations show us where we are missing physics from our

model improvements. Here in Paper 1 of this two part review I provide an

play crucial roles in processes such as percolation. Here we address these
issues, using maximum likelihood estimators to fit to the entire dataset, or
close to it. This methodology is applicable to any network dataset (or discrete

$\mu$, we use an improved version of our model that exploits the first epoch of
NIRCam images and newly obtained MUSE spectra, and avoids regions with $\mu>5$

galaxies with demagnified rest-frame $-22 \lesssim M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -19$ mag,
over an area of $\sim37$ sq. arcmin. Taking into account photometric
incompleteness and the effects of lensing on luminosity and cosmological
volume, we find that the density of $z\approx 10$ galaxies in the field is
about $10\times$ ($3\times$) larger than the average at $M_{UV}\approx -21~
(-20)$ mag reported so far. The density is even higher when considering only
the GLASS-JWST data, which are the deepest and the least affected by
magnification and incompleteness. The GLASS-JWST field contains 5 out of 7
galaxies, distributed along an apparent filamentary structure of 2 Mpc in
projected length, and includes a close pair of candidates with $M_{\rm UV}<

the presence of a $z\approx 10$ overdensity in the field. In addition to
providing excellent targets for efficient spectroscopic follow-up observations,
our study confirms the high density of bright galaxies observed in early {\it

sight to achieve an unbiased estimate of their average density and a first
estimate of their clustering.

development in statistical inference for the win ratio statistic has been
focusing on independent subjects without any potential confounding. When

challenges is confounding at baseline. Additionally, hierarchical observational

studies with patients nesting within hospitals. Such hierarchical structure can
introduce potential dependency or cluster effects among observations in the
analysis. To address these two issues when using the win ratio statistic, we
propose a weighted stratified causal win ratio estimator with calibrated

cluster effect distributions between comparison groups. We conducted extensive
simulation studies and showed promising performance of the proposed estimator
in terms of bias, variance estimation, type I error and power analysis,

intra-cluster correlations within clusters. Lastly, the proposed estimator was

Run 3, this paper investigates the relevance of using top quarks produced from
new long-lived particles, and detected in the tracker volume of the ATLAS and
CMS experiments. Such a signature, referred to as displaced top quarks, leads
to final states containing displaced vertices and a high multiplicity of
displaced jets and tracks, thanks to the top quark decays. Therefore, it is a
possible powerful tool for searching for new long-lived particles. Three
simplified models based on supersymmetry are explicitly designed for the study
of this signature. They differ according to the nature of the long-lived heavy
particle which produces at least one top quark: electrically neutral or
charged, coloured or non-coloured long-lived particle. For each model, a wide
region of parameter space, consistent with a reasonable number of displaced top
quarks decaying in a typical tracker volume has been probed. From this study,
promising benchmarks are defined and experimental guidelines are suggested.

  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  3D point clouds are rich in geometric structure information, while 2D images
contain important and continuous texture information. Combining 2D information
to achieve better 3D semantic segmentation has become mainstream in 3D scene
understanding. Albeit the success, it still remains elusive how to fuse and
process the cross-dimensional features from these two distinct spaces. Existing
state-of-the-art usually exploit bidirectional projection methods to align the
cross-dimensional features and realize both 2D & 3D semantic segmentation
tasks. However, to enable bidirectional mapping, this framework often requires
a symmetrical 2D-3D network structure, thus limiting the network's flexibility.
Meanwhile, such dual-task settings may distract the network easily and lead to
over-fitting in the 3D segmentation task. As limited by the network's
inflexibility, fused features can only pass through a decoder network, which
affects model performance due to insufficient depth. To alleviate these
drawbacks, in this paper, we argue that despite its simplicity, projecting
unidirectionally multi-view 2D deep semantic features into the 3D space aligned
with 3D deep semantic features could lead to better feature fusion. On the one
hand, the unidirectional projection enforces our model focused more on the core
task, i.e., 3D segmentation; on the other hand, unlocking the bidirectional to
unidirectional projection enables a deeper cross-domain semantic alignment and
enjoys the flexibility to fuse better and complicated features from very
different spaces. In joint 2D-3D approaches, our proposed method achieves
superior performance on the ScanNetv2 benchmark for 3D semantic segmentation.

different samples, ``robust,'' ``solid,'' and ``possible''. Using all of these

luminosity densities which are ~7x and ~20x higher than relying on the
``robust'' candidates alone. These results indicate the evolution of the UV LF

need for spectroscopy and deeper NIRCam+optical imaging to obtain reliable

initiates an early exploratory study of AI system risk assessment from both the

electrons specific to hot and dilute plasmas from astrophysical scenarios. The
(counter-)beaming electron firehose instability (BEFI) is induced for highly
oblique angles of propagation relative to the magnetic field, resembling the
fast growing and aperiodic mode triggered by the temperature anisotropy. It is
investigated here for space plasma conditions that includes the influence of an
embedding background plasma of electrons and protons. Kinetic theory is applied
to prescribe the unstable regimes, and differentiate from the regimes of
interplay with other instabilities. Linear theory predicts a systematic
inhibition of the BEFI, by reducing the growth rates and the range of unstable
wave-number with increasing the relative density of the background electrons.
To obtain finite growth rates, the beam speed does not need to be high (just
comparable to thermal speed), but beams must be dense enough, with a relative
density at least 15-20\% of the total density. The plasma conditions favorable
to this instability are reduced under the influence of background electrons.
PIC simulations confirm not only that BEFI can be excited in the presence of
background electrons, but also the inhibiting effect of this population. In the
regimes of transition to electrostatic (ES) instabilities, BEFI is still robust
enough to develop as a secondary instability, after the relaxation of beams
under a quick interaction with ES fluctuations. BEFI resembles the properties
of firehose heat-flux instability triggered by the electron strahl. However,
BEFI is driven by a double (counter-beaming) strahl, and develops at oblique
angles, which makes it effective in the regularization of the electron
counter-beams observed in closed magnetic field topologies and interplanetary
shocks.

tend to be more fragile under attacks, because the adversary has more places to
manipulate in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we find one reason for
video models' vulnerability is that they fail to perceive the correct motion
under adversarial perturbations. Inspired by the extensive evidence that motion
is a key factor for the human visual system, we propose to correct what the
model sees by restoring the perceived motion information. Since motion
information is an intrinsic structure of the video data, recovering motion
signals can be done at inference time without any human annotation, which
allows the model to adapt to unforeseen, worst-case inputs. Visualizations and
empirical experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets show that restoring
motion information in deep vision models improves adversarial robustness. Even

customers in Ukraine [8]. Considering the enormous resources available to state
and state-sponsored actors it has become difficult to detect cyber-attacks,

malicious states. The paper examines the effect of the actions of the state and
state-sponsored attacks on the cyber environment and critical infrastructures,
these adverse effects include; greatly diminished defense capacity of the
attacked states, destabilise the micro-economy, disinformation that can
effectively sway public opinion in a state [1]. Consequently, being aware of
the number of resources available at the disposal of the actors and the
enormous negative impacts on the cyber environment and critical

prepared to protect and prioritise network and security systems as a national
issue thus encouraging public-private collaboration.

challenge the $\Lambda$CDM limitations. Furthermore, the constrained current
value of the deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.832^{+0.091}_{-0.091}$ shows that
the present universe is accelerating. We also investigate the evolutionary

optimization problem where the total cost is the summation of time-varying
local cost functions of a group networked agents. The objective is to track the
optimal trajectory that minimizes the total cost at each time instant. Our
approach consists of a two-stage dynamics, where the first one samples the
first and second derivatives of the local costs periodically to construct an
estimate of the descent direction towards the optimal trajectory, and the
second one uses this estimate and a consensus term to drive local states
towards the time-varying solution while reaching consensus. The first part is
carried out by the implementation of a weighted average consensus algorithm in
the discrete-time framework and the second part is performed with a
continuous-time dynamics. Using the Lyapunov stability analysis, an upper bound
on the gradient of the total cost is obtained which is asymptotically reached.
This bound is characterized by the properties of the local costs. To
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a numerical example is
conducted that studies tuning the algorithm's parameters and their effects on

(CRE) mechanism to provide a quantitative understanding of global ozone
depletion. Based on a proposed electrostatic bonding mechanism for
charged-induced adsorption of molecules on surfaces and on the measured
dissociative electron transfer (DET) cross sections of ozone depletion
substances (ODSs) adsorbed on ice, an analytical equation is derived to give
atmospheric chlorine atom concentration: $$[Cl] = \sum_i k^i \theta_{ODS}^i
\Phi_e^2,$$ where $\Phi_e$ is the CR-produced prehydrated electron
($e_{pre}^-$) flux on atmospheric particle surfaces, $\theta_{ODS}^i$ is the
surface coverage of an ODS, and $k^i$ is the ODS's effective DET coefficient
comprising the DET cross section, lifetimes of surface-trapped $e_{pre}^-$ and
Cl$^-$, and particle surface area density. With concentrations of ODSs as the
sole variable, our calculated results of time-series ozone depletion rates in
global regions in the 1960s, 1980s and 2000s show generally good agreement with
observations, particularly with ground-based ozonesonde data and
satellite-measured data over Antarctica and with satellite data in the tropics
in a narrow altitude band at 13-20 km. Good agreements with satellite data in
the Arctic and midlatitudes are also found. A new insight into the
denitrification effect on ozone loss is given quantitatively. But this equation
overestimates tropospheric ozone loss at northern midlatitudes and the Arctic,
likely due to increased ozone production by the halogen chemistry in polluted
regions. Finally, ozone maps from ozonesonde data clearly reveal the scope of
the tropical ozone hole. The results render confidence in applying the CRE
equation to achieve a quantitative understanding of global ozone depletion.

requires designing non-trivial protocols that are not compatible between
hardware designs. When each project designs its own data format and protocols
the ability to collaborate between hardware developers is diminished, which is
an issue especially in the open-source community. Because the high-level
meaning of a protocol is often lost in translation to low-level languages when
a custom protocol needs to be designed, extra documentation is required, the
interpretation of which introduces new opportunities for errors. The Tydi
specification (Tydi-spec) was proposed to address the above issues by codifying
the composite and variable-length data structures in a type and providing a
standard protocol to transfer typed data among hardware components. The Tydi
intermediate representation (Tydi-IR) extends the Tydi-spec by defining typed
interfaces, typed components, and connections among typed components.
  In this thesis, we propose Tydi-lang, a high-level hardware description
language (HDL) for streaming designs. The language incorporates Tydi-spec to
describe typed streams and provides templates to describe abstract reusable
components. We also implement an open-source compiler from Tydi-lang to
Tydi-IR. We leverage a Tydi-IR to VHDL compiler, and also present a simulator
blueprint to identify streaming bottlenecks. We show several Tydi-lang examples
to translate high-level SQL to VHDL to demonstrate that Tydi-lang can
efficiently raise the level of abstraction and reduce design effort.

establish a bridge between both tasks by benchmarking the performance and

accepting the Einsteinian paradigm: general relativistic framework, covariant

absent in Einstein's work. A new approach is proposed in this paper in which
pure unimodular relativity is defined in terms of equi-projective geodesics
with the fundamental metric tensor having determinant unity and the geometric
tensors constructed from them. Modification of covariant divergence law for the

conventional unimodular gravity an effective cosmological term comprising of
two variable scalar fields, namely, the unimodular geometric ambiguity and
unimodular matter energy ambiguity, is proposed. A radical departure on the
cosmological constant problem is possible assuming differing evolution of the
two scalars: the Einstein equations emerge when the two ambiguities cancel each

field equations are proposed consistent with the unimodular space-time

examples, the motivating question in this paper is: How do wind-driven waves
produce ocean surface currents? The paper first summarises the geometric
mechanics approach for deriving hybrid models of multiscale, multiphysics
motions in ideal fluid dynamics. It then illustrates this approach for WMFI in
the examples of 3D WKB waves and 2D wave amplitudes governed by the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation propagating in the frame of motion of an ideal
incompressible inhomogeneous Euler fluid flow. The results for these examples
tell us that the fluid flow in WMFI does not create waves. However, feedback in
the opposite direction is possible, since 3D WKB and 2D NLS wave dynamics can
indeed create circulatory fluid flow.

the coefficient matrix are external numbers in the sense of nonstandard
analysis. External numbers represent real numbers with small, individual error
terms. Using Gaussian elimination, a flexible system can be put into a
row-echelon form with increasing error terms at the right-hand side. Then
parameters are assigned to the error terms and the resulting system is solved
by common methods of linear algebra. The solution set may have indeterminacy
not only in terms of linear spaces, but also of modules. We determine maximal
robustness for flexible systems.

  Supersonic Micro Nozzle using Bypass Mass Injection","Journal paper and it's under review",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Converging diverging micro nozzle is fundamentally intended for flow
acceleration through the generation of kinetic energy for the advanced
micro-propulsion systems. Such supersonic micro nozzles have significant
applications in the launching, propulsion and rapid directional control of the
micro-satellites for a better maneuver. Micro scale analysis of such flow
devices is extended to the rarefied flow regime. Present study has addressed
thrust vectoring in a planar converging-diverging supersonic micro nozzle by
the bypass mass injection technique. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method has been used for numerical modelling. Primary focus is given on the
thrust vectoring control of the micro nozzle with a throat height of 20 micro
meter and an expansion ratio of 1.7. For the secondary injection, a rectangular
channel of 5 different bypass widths (2 - 12 micro meter) is considered for two
different outlet pressures (Pout = 10 kPa and 40 kPa) while keeping the inlet
pressure (Pin) and temperature (Tin) fixed at 1 atm and 300 k respectively. The
physical behavior of the micro nozzle is acknowledged through the analysis of
Mach, pressure, temperature and density contours. Numerical results reveal that
the secondary flow injection is adapted into the primary flow through the
formation of a pressure bump in the diverging section. Moreover, the total mass
flow rate, secondary flow percentage, thrust force, the thrust coefficient and
specific impulse increase with the bypass channel width. A change in thrust
direction is obtained which in turn produces a considerable vectoring effect in
the supersonic micro nozzle. The vectoring angle for Pout of 40 kPa peaks at 6
micro meter bypass channel whereas a gradual increase of the vectoring angle
with the bypass channel width is observed for Pout = 10 kPa.
