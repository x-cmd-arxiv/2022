image classification tasks. Notably, their accuracy is similar to the
state-of-the-art accuracy obtained by full-precision models tailored to edge
devices. In this regard, BNNs are very amenable to edge devices since they
employ 1-bit to store the inputs and weights, and thus, their storage
requirements are low. Also, BNNs computations are mainly done using xnor and
pop-counts operations which are implemented very efficiently using simple
hardware structures. Nonetheless, supporting BNNs efficiently on mobile CPUs is
far from trivial since their benefits are hindered by frequent memory accesses
to load weights and inputs.
  In BNNs, a weight or an input is stored using one bit, and aiming to increase
storage and computation efficiency, several of them are packed together as a
sequence of bits. In this work, we observe that the number of unique sequences
representing a set of weights is typically low. Also, we have seen that during
the evaluation of a BNN layer, a small group of unique sequences is employed
more frequently than others. Accordingly, we propose exploiting this
observation by using Huffman Encoding to encode the bit sequences and then
using an indirection table to decode them during the BNN evaluation. Also, we
propose a clustering scheme to identify the most common sequences of bits and
replace the less common ones with some similar common sequences. Hence, we
decrease the storage requirements and memory accesses since common sequences
are encoded with fewer bits.
  We extend a mobile CPU by adding a small hardware structure that can
efficiently cache and decode the compressed sequence of bits. We evaluate our
scheme using the ReAacNet model with the Imagenet dataset. Our experimental
results show that our technique can reduce memory requirement by 1.32x and
improve performance by 1.35x.

$\theta_{13}=0$ that it is not consistent with experimental data and does not

  We find that for the complex perturbation mass matrix, only the results of

the creation of realistic avatars for the virtual reality. Both problems are
highly challenging, because hair has complex geometry and appearance, as well

that models hair independently from the head to address these challenges in a
data-driven manner. The first stage, state compression, learns a
low-dimensional latent space of 3D hair states containing motion and

the compression stage for de-noising of the hair state. Our model outperforms

of the most practical techniques to train efficient yet accurate models.
However, BEV KD is still under-explored to the best of our knowledge. Different
from image classification tasks, BEV 3D object detection approaches are more

localization advantage of LiDAR points. Specifically, we transform the LiDAR
points to BEV space and generate the foreground mask and view-dependent mask
for the teacher-student paradigm. It is to be noted that our method only uses
LiDAR points to guide the KD between RGB models. As the quality of depth

droplets. A complete understanding of the fate and transport of spilled oil
requires bridging the present gap between these length scales and determining
how microscale processes affect large-scale transport of oil. Here, we describe
experimental results describing rising oil droplets in a purpose-built
hydrodynamic treadmill which rotates to keep droplets stationary in the lab
frame for continuous, direct observation. Droplets of radii 10-100 $\mu$m are
colonized and deformed by bacteria over several days before their rising speeds
through the water column are measured. Rising speeds of deformed droplets are
significantly slower as a result of bio-aggregate formation at the droplet
surface compared to those of droplets of weathered or unweathered oil without
bacteria. Additionally, we discover bio-aggregate particles of oil and
bacterial biofilms which sink through the water column. The composition of
these particles is quantified using fluorescence microscopy. These results have
important implications for the study of oil transport following a spill, as
colonization by bacteria can cause oil droplets to remain in the water column
for months or years longer than otherwise expected. An improved understanding
of the physical transformations of oil droplets during biodegradation shows
promise for significantly improving models of oil spills. Additionally, the

sub-fields, and/or are not flexible and modular enough to be transferred to
other datasets. In this thesis, we conduct a scientometric analysis to uncover
the implicit patterns hidden in CS metadata and to determine the state of CS
research. Specifically, we investigate trends of the quantity, impact, and
topics for authors, venues, document types (conferences vs. journals), and
fields of study (compared to, e.g., medicine). To achieve this we introduce the
CS-Insights system, an interactive web application to analyze CS publications
with various dashboards, filters, and visualizations. The data underlying this
system is the DBLP Discovery Dataset (D3), which contains metadata from 5
million CS publications. Both D3 and CS-Insights are open-access, and
CS-Insights can be easily adapted to other datasets in the future. The most
interesting findings of our scientometric analysis include that i) there has
been a stark increase in publications, authors, and venues in the last two
decades, ii) many authors only recently joined the field, iii) the most cited
authors and venues focus on computer vision and pattern recognition, while the
most productive prefer engineering-related topics, iv) the preference of
researchers to publish in conferences over journals dwindles, v) on average,
journal articles receive twice as many citations compared to conference papers,
but the contrast is much smaller for the most cited conferences and journals,
and vi) journals also get more citations in all other investigated fields of
study, while only CS and engineering publish more in conferences than journals.

  Learning","37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The Shapley value (SV) is adopted in various scenarios in machine learning
(ML), including data valuation, agent valuation, and feature attribution, as it
satisfies their fairness requirements. However, as exact SVs are infeasible to
compute in practice, SV estimates are approximated instead. This approximation
step raises an important question: do the SV estimates preserve the fairness
guarantees of exact SVs? We observe that the fairness guarantees of exact SVs
are too restrictive for SV estimates. Thus, we generalise Shapley fairness to
probably approximate Shapley fairness and propose fidelity score, a metric to
measure the variation of SV estimates, that determines how probable the
fairness guarantees hold. Our last theoretical contribution is a novel greedy
active estimation (GAE) algorithm that will maximise the lowest fidelity score
and achieve a better fairness guarantee than the de facto Monte-Carlo
estimation. We empirically verify GAE outperforms several existing methods in
guaranteeing fairness while remaining competitive in estimation accuracy in
various ML scenarios using real-world datasets.

comprehensively explore the structural, electronic, elastic, and optical
properties of Ti2O3 and SrTiO3. In this study, the ground state properties were
computed with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), without spin-orbit coupling, and with
the inclusion of Hubbard U parameter. The electronic bandgaps of Ti2O3 have
been found to be 0.059 eV without SOC, 0.131 eV with SOC, and 1.665 eV with
Hubbard U. Electronic bandgaps of 1.612 eV, 1.761 eV, and 2.769 eV have been
obtained for SrTiO3, respectively, without SOC, with SOC, and with Hubbard U.
In every single case, it has been found that Ti-4d orbitals predominate close
to the top of the valence band. The bandgap and estimated lattice constants for
ATiO3 (A=Ti,Sr) were not significantly affected by SOC. The mechanical
stability test showed that ATiO3 (A=Ti,Sr) is mechanically stable at zero

optical property predictions. Ti2O3 and SrTiO3 are good UV-Vis absorbers and
appropriate for photovoltaic applications owing to the optical absorption

black hole solutions characterized by a single-function for the metric,
$-g_{tt}=g^{-1}_{rr}\equiv f(r)$, and a simple azimuthal form for the scalar.
Such black holes, whose metric can be determined fully analytically, generalize
the BTZ solution in various ways, including singularity-free black holes
without any fine-tuning of couplings or parameters. In this paper we extend the
family of EQT theories to general curvature orders. We show that, beyond linear
order, $f(r)$ satisfies a second-order differential equation rather than an
algebraic one, making the corresponding theories belong to the Electromagnetic
Generalized Quasi-topological (EGQT) class. We prove that at each curvature
order, the most general EGQT density is given by a single term which
contributes nontrivially to the equation of $f(r)$ plus densities which do not
contribute at all to such equation. The proof relies on the counting of the
exact number of independent order-$n$ densities of the form
$\mathcal{L}(R_{ab},\partial_a \phi)$, which we carry out. We study some
general aspects of the new families of EGQT black-hole solutions, including
their thermodynamic properties and the fulfillment of the first law, and

  Our method consistently outperforms baselines across 7 distribution shifts, 6

proposed approach FLYP outperforms the top of the leaderboard by $2.3\%$ ID and
$2.7\%$ OOD, giving the highest reported accuracy. Averaged across 7 OOD
datasets (2 WILDS and 5 ImageNet associated shifts), FLYP gives gains of
$4.2\%$ OOD over standard finetuning and outperforms the current state of the

ubiquitous objects in machine learning, statistics and other related fields.
The main drawback of using kernel methods (learning and inference using kernel
matrices) is efficiency -- given $n$ input points, most kernel-based algorithms
need to materialize the full $n \times n$ kernel matrix before performing any
subsequent computation, thus incurring $\Omega(n^2)$ runtime. Breaking this
quadratic barrier for various problems has therefore, been a subject of
extensive research efforts.
  We break the quadratic barrier and obtain $\textit{subquadratic}$ time
algorithms for several fundamental linear-algebraic and graph processing
primitives, including approximating the top eigenvalue and eigenvector,
spectral sparsification, solving linear systems, local clustering, low-rank
approximation, arboricity estimation and counting weighted triangles. We build
on the recent Kernel Density Estimation framework, which (after preprocessing
in time subquadratic in $n$) can return estimates of row/column sums of the
kernel matrix. In particular, we develop efficient reductions from
$\textit{weighted vertex}$ and $\textit{weighted edge sampling}$ on kernel
graphs, $\textit{simulating random walks}$ on kernel graphs, and
$\textit{importance sampling}$ on matrices to Kernel Density Estimation and
show that we can generate samples from these distributions in
$\textit{sublinear}$ (in the support of the distribution) time. Our reductions
are the central ingredient in each of our applications and we believe they may
be of independent interest. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our
algorithms on low-rank approximation (LRA) and spectral sparsification, where
we observe a $\textbf{9x}$ decrease in the number of kernel evaluations over
baselines for LRA and a $\textbf{41x}$ reduction in the graph size for spectral
sparsification.

  Tomography",,,,,"eess.IV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neutron computed tomography (nCT) is a 3D characterization technique used to
image the internal morphology or chemical composition of samples in biology and
materials sciences. A typical workflow involves placing the sample in the path
of a neutron beam, acquiring projection data at a predefined set of
orientations, and processing the resulting data using an analytic
reconstruction algorithm. Typical nCT scans require hours to days to complete
and are then processed using conventional filtered back-projection (FBP), which
performs poorly with sparse views or noisy data. Hence, the main methods in
order to reduce overall acquisition time are the use of an improved sampling
strategy combined with the use of advanced reconstruction methods such as
model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). In this paper, we propose an
adaptive orientation selection method in which an MBIR reconstruction on
previously-acquired measurements is used to define an objective function on
orientations that balances a data-fitting term promoting edge alignment and a
regularization term promoting orientation diversity. Using simulated and
experimental data, we demonstrate that our method produces high-quality
reconstructions using significantly fewer total measurements than the
conventional approach.

we present MatSim: the first dataset and benchmark for computer vision-based
recognition of similarities and transitions between materials and textures,
focusing on identifying any material under any conditions using one or a few
examples. The dataset contains synthetic and natural images. The synthetic
images were rendered using giant collections of textures, objects, and
environments generated by computer graphics artists. We use mixtures and
gradual transitions between materials to allow the system to learn cases with
smooth transitions between states (like gradually cooked food). We also render
images with materials inside transparent containers to support beverage and
chemistry lab use cases. We use this dataset to train a siamese net that
identifies the same material in different objects, mixtures, and environments.
The descriptor generated by this net can be used to identify the states of
materials and their subclasses using a single image. We also present the first
few-shot material recognition benchmark with images from a wide range of
fields, including the state of foods and drinks, types of grounds, and many
other use cases. We show that a net trained on the MatSim synthetic dataset
outperforms state-of-the-art models like Clip on the benchmark and also
achieves good results on other unsupervised material classification tasks.

  Motivated by the observation that visually similar objects are close in the

follow a hierarchical structure based on their compositionality. To exploit
such a structure, we propose a contrastive learning framework where a Euclidean
loss is used to learn object representations and a hyperbolic loss is used to
encourage representations of scenes to lie close to representations of their
constituent objects in a hyperbolic space. This novel hyperbolic objective
encourages the scene-object hypernymy among the representations by optimizing
the magnitude of their norms. We show that when pretraining on the COCO and
OpenImages datasets, the hyperbolic loss improves downstream performance of
several baselines across multiple datasets and tasks, including image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We also show that

defects become autonomous particles that spontaneously propel from internal
active stresses and drive chaotic flows stirring the fluid. The intimate
connection between defect textures and active flow suggests that properties of
active materials can be engineered by controlling defects, but design
principles for their spatiotemporal control remain elusive. Here we provide a
symmetry-based additive strategy for using elementary activity patterns, as
active topological tweezers, to create, move and braid such defects. By
combining theory and simulations, we demonstrate how, at the collective level,
spatial activity gradients act like electric fields which, when strong enough,
induce an inverted topological polarization of defects, akin to an exotic
negative susceptibility dielectric. We harness this feature in a dynamic
setting to collectively pattern and transport interacting active defects. Our
work establishes an additive framework to sculpt flows and manipulate active
defects in both space and time, paving the way to design programmable active

high-performance machine-learning, usually deep learning, techniques with

ways to limit Russia's oil income. This paper considers, theoretically and
quantitatively, two such options: 1) an export-quantity restriction and 2) a
forced discount on Russian oil. We build a quantifiable model of the global oil
market and analyze how each of these policies affect: which Russian oil fields
fall out of production; the global oil supply; and the global oil price. By
these statics we derive the effects of the policies on Russian oil profits and
oil-importers' economic surplus. The effects on Russian oil profits are
substantial. In the short run (within the first year), a quantity restriction
of 20% yields Russian losses of 62 million USD per day, equivalent to 1.2% of
GDP and 32% of military spending. In the long run (beyond a year) new
investments become unprofitable. Losses rise to 100 million USD per day, 2% of
GDP and 56% of military spending. A price discount of 20% is even more harmful
to Russia, yielding losses of 152 million USD per day, equivalent to 3.1% of
GDP and 85% of military spending in the short run and long run. A price
discount puts generally more burden on Russia and less on importers compared to
a quantity restriction. In fact, a price discount implies net gains for oil
importers as it essentially redistributes oil rents from Russia to importers.
If the restrictions are expected to last for long, the burden on oil importers
decreases. Overall, both policies at all levels imply larger relative losses
for Russia than for oil importers (in shares of their GDP). The case for a
price discount on Russian oil is thus strong. However, Russia may choose not to
export at the discounted price, in which case the price-discount sanction
becomes a de facto supply restriction.

for which the covering space is not $\mathbb{E}^3$. We proposed and motivated a
modification of that equation such that this limit is possible. The new
equation features an additional `topological term' related to a second
non-dynamical, reference, metric. In this second paper, we analyse the
consequences for cosmology of this modification of Einstein's equation. First,
we show that the expansion laws do not feature anymore the curvature parameter
(i.e. $\Omega = 1, \ \forall \Omega_K$). This is valid for the exact
homogeneous and isotropic solution of the bi-metric theory, and for a general
(inhomogeneous) solution in the non-relativistic limit. Second, we show that
the weak field equations have the same number of free parameters as for the
$k\Lambda$CDM model, i.e. with curvature, the differences being the
disappearance of the coupling terms with that curvature in the scalar mode
equations. Therefore, in our cosmological model, spatial curvature has smaller
effects on the dynamics than in the $k\Lambda$CDM model; the effect remains
essentially geometrical. Accordingly, the main observational difference we may
expect between our model and the $k\Lambda$CDM model is a non-negligible
spatial curvature inferred from cosmological data. This is particularly
interesting in the context of a rising debate on the value of $\Omega_K$ and
increasing observational tensions.

we show the trained model may make predictions for circuits with higher degrees

make predictions for non-Clifford circuits even when the training set included
only Clifford-reducible circuits. This empirical demonstration suggests
classical machine learning may be useful for making predictions about

(MDP). We consider the cases where the transition probabilities of this MDP are
either known up to an interval or completely unknown. Our approach is based on
a finite-state abstraction that captures both the discrete (mode-jumping) and
continuous (stochastic linear) behaviour of the MJLS. We formalise this
abstraction as an interval MDP (iMDP) for which we compute intervals of
transition probabilities using sampling techniques from the so-called 'scenario

acquire high-angular-resolution images and optical light curves of the asteroid

acquired with VLT/SPHERE were combined with optical light curves to reconstruct
the shape of the asteroid using the ADAM, MPCD, and SAGE algorithms. The origin
of the shape was investigated by means of N-body simulations. Cybele has a
volume-equivalent diameter of 263+/-3km and a bulk density of
1.55+/-0.19g.cm-3. Notably, its shape and rotation state are closely compatible
with those of a Maclaurin equilibrium figure. The lack of a collisional family
associated with Cybele and the higher bulk density of that body with respect to
other large P-type asteroids suggest that it never experienced any large
disruptive impact followed by rapid re-accumulation. This would imply that its
present-day shape represents the original one. However, numerical integration
of the long-term dynamical evolution of a hypothetical family shows that it is
dispersed by gravitational perturbations and chaotic diffusion over Gyrs of
evolution. The very close match between Cybele and an equilibrium figure opens
up the possibility that D>260km small bodies from the outer Solar System all
formed at equilibrium. However, we cannot rule out an old impact as the origin
of the equilibrium shape. Cybele itself is found to be dynamically unstable,
implying that it was recently (<1Ga) placed on its current orbit either through
slow diffusion from a relatively stable orbit in the Cybele region or, less
likely, from an unstable, JFC orbit in the planet-crossing region.

locomotion, legged robots have to be terrain aware. Terrain-Aware Locomotion
(TAL) implies that the robot can perceive the terrain with its sensors, and can
take decisions based on this information. This thesis presents TAL strategies
both from a proprioceptive and an exteroceptive perspective. The strategies are
implemented at the level of locomotion planning, control, and state estimation,
and using optimization and learning techniques. The first part is on TAL
strategies at the Whole-Body Control (WBC) level. We introduce a passive WBC
(pWBC) framework that allows the robot to stabilize and walk over challenging
terrain while taking into account the terrain geometry (inclination) and
friction properties. The pWBC relies on rigid contact assumptions which makes
it suitable only for stiff terrain. As a consequence, we introduce Soft Terrain
Adaptation aNd Compliance Estimation (STANCE) which is a soft terrain
adaptation algorithm that generalizes beyond rigid terrain. The second part of
the thesis focuses on vision-based TAL strategies. We present Vision-Based
Terrain-Aware Locomotion (ViTAL) which is an online planning strategy that
selects the footholds based on the robot capabilities, and the robot pose that
maximizes the chances of the robot succeeding in reaching these footholds.
ViTAL relies on a set of robot skills that characterizes the capabilities of
the robot and its legs. The skills include the robot's ability to assess the
terrain's geometry, avoid leg collisions, and avoid reaching kinematic limits.
Our strategies are based on optimization and learning methods and are validated
on HyQ and HyQReal in simulation and experiment. We show that with the help of
these strategies, we can push dynamic legged robots one step closer to being
fully autonomous and terrain aware.

Ferland et al. (2020), we take He II $\lambda 4686$ as a proxy for the FUV
continuum and compare the flux of several other line species against it. This
comparison reveals a clear pattern, whereby lines respond close to linearly at
low FUV fluxes, and saturate at high FUV fluxes. The saturation level of the
response appears to depend on the excitation energy of the line species. In
addition to this global pattern, we note changes among observational epochs,
indicating a structural evolution in the broad line region (BLR). The line
profiles in our spectra show an offset between the narrow and broad components
of the He II $\lambda 4686$ and H$\beta$ lines. This offset shows a significant
negative correlation with the FUV flux and a positive correlation with the line
velocity width. Our analysis reveals a complex BLR response to a changing

indicates the existence of multiple contributions to the line emission. We find

theory. Despite the absence of supersymmetry in particle physics, it can
potentially emerge in exotic phases of strongly correlated condensed matter

and image reconstruction technique for fast and robust, high-resolution,
whole-brain imaging as well as quantitative T2* mapping. Methods: 3D-Blip-Up
and -Down Acquisition (3D-BUDA) sequence is designed for both single- and
multi-echo 3D GRE-EPI imaging using multiple shots with blip-up and -down
readouts to encode B0 field map information. Complementary k-space coverage is
achieved using controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) sampling across
the shots. For image reconstruction, an iterative hard-thresholding algorithm
is employed to minimize the cost function that combines field map information
informed parallel imaging with the structured low-rank constraint for
multi-shot 3D-BUDA data. Extending 3D-BUDA to multi-echo imaging permits T2*
mapping. For this, we propose constructing a joint Hankel matrix along both
echo and shot dimensions to improve the reconstruction. Results: Experimental
results on in vivo multi-echo data demonstrate that, by performing joint
reconstruction along with both echo and shot dimensions, reconstruction
accuracy is improved compared to standard 3D-BUDA reconstruction. CAIPI
sampling is further shown to enhance the image quality. For T2* mapping, T2*
values from 3D-Joint-CAIPI-BUDA and reference multi-echo GRE are within limits
of agreement as quantified by Bland-Altman analysis. Conclusions: The proposed
technique enables rapid 3D distortion-free high-resolution imaging and T2*
mapping. Specifically, 3D-BUDA enables 1-mm isotropic whole-brain imaging in 22
s at 3 T and 9 s on a 7 T scanner. The combination of multi-echo 3D-BUDA with
CAIPI acquisition and joint reconstruction enables distortion-free whole-brain
T2* mapping in 47 s at 1.1x1.1x1.0 mm3 resolution.

their transient states quickly become non-Gibbsian, even if the systems

the transient regime, we use a refined notion of thermality, which we call
g-local. A system is g-locally thermal if the states of all its small
subsystems are marginals of global thermal states. We numerically demonstrate
for two harmonic lattices that whenever the total system equilibrates in the
long run, each lattice remains g-locally thermal at all times, including the

interactions within them. In all cases, we find that the equilibrium is
described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble, with 3D lattices requiring special

that if the players take the payment promises into account, then all
undominated strategies are desired? Furthermore, we aim to minimize the cost,
that is, the worst-case amount of payments.
  We study the tractability of computing such payment promises and determine
more closely what obstructions we may have to overcome in doing so. We show
that GAME IMPLEMENTATION is NP-hard even for two players, solving in particular
a long open question (Eidenbenz et al. 2011) and suggesting more restrictions
are necessary to obtain tractability results. We thus study the regime in which
players have only a small constant number of strategies and obtain the
following. First, this case remains NP-hard even if each player's utility
depends only on three others. Second, we repair a flawed efficient algorithm
for the case of both small number of strategies and small number of players.

  Journal dedicated to Sergey Naboko",,,,"math.SP math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The spectral and scattering properties of non-selfadjoint problems pose a
mathematical challenge. Apart from exceptional cases, the well-developed
methods used to examine the spectrum of selfadjoint problems are not
applicable. One of the tools to attack non-selfadjoint problems are functional
models. A drawback of many functional models is that their constructions
require objects which may be difficult to describe explicitly, such as operator
square roots, making it hard to apply the results to specific examples.
  We develop a functional model for the case when the non-selfadjointness
arises both in additive terms and in the boundary conditions which is based on
the Lagrange identity. The flexibility of the choice of the $\Gamma$-operators
in the Lagrange identity means that these can be chosen so that expressions
arising in the model are given explicitly in terms of physical parameters
(coefficients, boundary conditions and Titchmarsh-Weyl $M$-function) of the
maximally dissipative operator. The presentation of such explicit expressions
for the spectral form of the functional model is arguably the main contribution
of the present paper. In the spectral form of the functional model, the
selfadjoint dilation is very simple, being the operator of multiplication by an
independent variable in some auxiliary vector-valued function space. We also
obtain an explicit expression for the completely non-selfadjoint part of the
operator and an operator-analytic proof of the famous result by Sz.-Nagy-Foias
on the pure absolute continuity of the spectrum of the minimal selfadjoint
dilation. Finally, we consider an example of a limit circle Sturm-Liouville

However, the large inhomogeneity of single layers cannot be overcome by the

the rich band structure supports dark excitonic states with strong binding

certain theoretical and hardware-specific limitations. Notably, the problem of
vanishing gradients, or barren plateaus, renders the training impossible for
circuits with high qubit counts, imposing a limit on the number of qubits that
data scientists can use for solving problems. Independently, angle-embedded
supervised quantum neural networks were shown to produce truncated Fourier
series with a degree directly dependent on two factors: the depth of the
encoding, and the number of parallel qubits the encoding is applied to. The
degree of the Fourier series limits the model expressivity. This work
introduces two new architectures whose Fourier degrees grow exponentially: the
sequential and parallel exponential quantum machine learning architectures.
This is done by efficiently using the available Hilbert space when encoding,
increasing the expressivity of the quantum encoding. Therefore, the exponential
growth allows staying at the low-qubit limit to create highly expressive
circuits avoiding barren plateaus. Practically, parallel exponential
architecture was shown to outperform the existing linear architectures by
reducing their final mean square error value by up to 44.7% in a
one-dimensional test problem. Furthermore, the feasibility of this technique
was also shown on a trapped ion quantum processing unit.

on the interplay between the dynamics and the graph topology. We develop a

the existence of a critical mass number $c_0\in(0,\infty)$ that sharply

key notions that are necessary to introduce mechanism design, and then we offer
a comprehensive discussion of the principles in mechanism design. Finally, we
explore four key applications of mechanism design in engineering, i.e.,

transverse momentum region, where transverse momentum dependent (TMD) pdfs are
needed, from a purely collinear large transverse momentum region, and we
examine the influence of subleading power corrections. We also review the steps
for formulating TMD factorization in transverse coordinate space, and we study
the effect of transforming to the well-known $b_*$-scheme. Within the Yukawa

Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies. The platform consists of a
two-dimensional Si/GeSn core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning
the light polarization, we show that the metasurface reflectance can be
efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and
magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in
high-index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the
directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp
polarization-modulated resonances. This tunability is harnessed in nanosensors

With a Gaussian process-based methodology, we reconstruct non-parametric star
formation histories in spatially-resolved spaxels covering the face of each

obvious signatures of AGN feedback. However, the AGN galaxies have
significantly suppressed central (kpc-scale) SFRs, lying up to a factor of $2$
below that of the control galaxies, providing direct observational evidence of
AGN feedback suppressing star formation. The suppression of central SFRs in the
AGN galaxies began in the central regions $\sim 6$ Gyr ago (redshift $z \sim
0.7$), taking place over a few Gyrs. A small subset of the AGN galaxies were
rapidly driven to quiescence shortly before being observed (in the last $500$
Myr), potentially indicating instances of AGN-driven feedback. More frequently,
however, star formation continues in the AGN galaxies, with suppression
primarily in the central regions. This is suggestive of a picture in which
integrated (Gyr-timescale) AGN feedback can significantly affect central star
formation, but may be inefficient in driving galaxy-wide quenching in

baryonic loading may suffice to power Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs).
Motivated by this, we study the radiative signatures of cosmic-ray protons in
the prompt phase of energetic GRBs. Our framework is the internal shock model
with multi-collision descriptions of the relativistic ejecta (with different
emission regions along the jet), plus time-dependent calculations of photon and
neutrino spectra. Our GRB prototypes are motivated by {\em Fermi}-LAT detected
GRBs (including GRB~221009A) for which further, owing to the large energy flux,
neutrino non-observation of single events may pose a strong limit on the
baryonic loading. We study the feedback of protons on electromagnetic spectra
in synchrotron- and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios to identify the
multi-wavelength signatures, to constrain the maximally allowed baryonic
loading, and to point out the differences between hadronic and inverse Compton
signatures. We find that hadronic signatures appear as correlated flux
increases in the optical-UV to soft X-ray and GeV to TeV gamma-ray ranges in
the synchrotron scenarios, whereas they are difficult to identify in inverse
Compton-dominated scenarios. We demonstrate that baryonic loadings around 10,
which satisfy the UHECR energetic requirements, do not distort the predicted
photon spectra in the {\em Fermi}-GBM range and are consistent with constraints
from neutrino data if the collision radii are large enough (i.e., the time
variability is not too short). It therefore seems plausible that under the
condition of large dissipation radii a population of energetic GRBs can be the
origin of the UHECRs.

in synchrotron and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios. Our leptohadronic model
includes UHE protons potentially accelerated in the outflow, and their feedback
on spectral energy distribution and on the neutrino emission. We find that we
can roughly reproduce the observed light curves with an engine with varying
ejection velocity of ultra-relativistic material, which has an intermediate
quiescent period of about 200 seconds and a variability timescale of $\sim1$~s.
We consider baryonic loadings of 3 and 30 that are compatible with the
hypothesis that the highest-energetic LHAASO photons might come from UHECR
interactions with the extragalactic background light, and the paradigm that
energetic GRBs may power the UHECR flux. For these values and the high
dissipation radii considered we find consistency with the non-observation of
neutrinos and no significant signatures on the electromagnetic spectrum.
Inverse Compton-dominated scenarios from the prompt emission are demonstrated
to lead to about an order of magnitude higher fluxes in the HE-range; this
enhancement is testable by its spectral impact in the Fermi-GBM and LAT ranges.

a promising choice of architecture for modeling long range dependencies across
various modalities. However, they invariably rely on discretization of a
continuous state space, which complicates their presentation and understanding.
In this work, we dispose of the discretization step, and propose a model based
on vanilla Diagonal Linear RNNs ($\mathrm{DLR}$). We empirically show that
$\mathrm{DLR}$ is as performant as previously-proposed SSMs in the presence of
strong supervision, despite being conceptually much simpler. Moreover, we
characterize the expressivity of SSMs (including $\mathrm{DLR}$) and
attention-based models via a suite of $13$ synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks
involving interactions over tens of thousands of tokens, ranging from simple
operations, such as shifting an input sequence, to detecting co-dependent
visual features over long spatial ranges in flattened images. We find that
while SSMs report near-perfect performance on tasks that can be modeled via
$\textit{few}$ convolutional kernels, they struggle on tasks requiring
$\textit{many}$ such kernels and especially when the desired sequence
manipulation is $\textit{context-dependent}$. For example, $\mathrm{DLR}$
learns to perfectly shift a $0.5M$-long input by an arbitrary number of

previous work, we studied the generation of a doubly peaked spectrum of induced
stochastic gravitational wave background (ISGWB) for such a scenario and
explored the possibility of probing a class of baryogenesis models wherein the
emission of massive unstable particles from the PBH evaporation and their
subsequent decay contributes to the matter-antimatter asymmetry. In this work,
we extend the scope of our earlier work by including spinning PBHs and consider
the emission of light relativistic dark sector particles, which contribute to
the dark radiation (DR) and massive stable dark sector particles, thereby
accounting for the dark matter (DM) component of the universe. The ISGWB can
probe the non-thermal production of these heavy DM particles, which cannot be
accessible in laboratory searches. For the case of DR, we find a novel
complementarity between the measurements of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from these
emitted particles and the ISGWB from PBH domination. Our results indicate that
the ISGWB has a weak dependence on the initial PBH spin. However, for gravitons
as the DR particles, the initial PBH spin plays a significant role, and only
above a critical value of the initial spin parameter $a_*$, which depends only
on initial PBH mass, the graviton emission can be probed in the CMB-HD
experiment. Upcoming CMB experiments such as CMB-HD and CMB-Bharat, together
with future GW detectors like LISA and ET, open up an exciting possibility of
constraining the PBHs parameter space providing deeper insights into the
expansion history of the universe between the end of inflation and BBN.

idea of multi-resolution training for improved performance on a wide spectrum
of, mostly unseen, testing resolutions. In particular, ResFormer operates on
replicated images of different resolutions and enforces a scale consistency
loss to engage interactive information across different scales. More
importantly, to alternate among varying resolutions effectively, especially
novel ones in testing, we propose a global-local positional embedding strategy
that changes smoothly conditioned on input sizes. We conduct extensive
experiments for image classification on ImageNet. The results provide strong
quantitative evidence that ResFormer has promising scaling abilities towards a
wide range of resolutions. For instance, ResFormer-B-MR achieves a Top-1
accuracy of 75.86% and 81.72% when evaluated on relatively low and high
resolutions respectively (i.e., 96 and 640), which are 48% and 7.49% better

Accretion disks, protoplanetary disks, asteroid belts, and planetary rings are

computationally efficient. The inclusion of collisions in the simulations is
challenging but important. We intend to calculate the time of collision of two
astronomical bodies in intersecting Kepler orbits as a function of the orbital
elements. The aim is to use the solution in an analytic propagator ($N$-body
simulation) that jumps from one collision event to the next. We outline an
algorithm that maintains a list of possible collision pairs ordered
chronologically. At each step (the soonest event on the list), only the
particles created in the collision can cause new collision possibilities. We
estimate the collision rate, the length of the list, and the average change in
this length at an event, and study the efficiency of the method used. We find
that the collision-time problem is equivalent to finding the grid point between
two parallel lines that is closest to the origin. The solution is based on the
continued fraction of the ratio of orbital periods. Due to the large jumps in
time, the algorithm can beat tree codes (octree and $k$-d tree codes can
efficiently detect collisions) for specific systems such as the Solar System
with $N<10^8$. However, the gravitational interactions between particles can
only be treated as gravitational scattering or as a secular perturbation, at
the cost of reducing the time-step or at the cost of accuracy. While
simulations of this size with high-fidelity propagators can already span vast
timescales, the high efficiency of the collision detection allows many runs
from one initial state or a large sample set, so that one can study statistics.

efficient method for training CLIP. Our method randomly masks out and removes a
large portion of image patches during training. Masking allows us to learn from
more image-text pairs given the same wall-clock time and contrast more samples
per iteration with similar memory footprint. It leads to a favorable trade-off
between accuracy and training time. In our experiments on 400 million
image-text pairs, FLIP improves both accuracy and speed over the no-masking
baseline. On a large diversity of downstream tasks, FLIP dominantly outperforms
the CLIP counterparts trained on the same data. Facilitated by the speedup, we
explore the scaling behavior of increasing the model size, data size, or
training length, and report encouraging results and comparisons. We hope that
our work will foster future research on scaling vision-language learning.

solution by using Gibbons and Werner technique in non-plasma, plasma, and dark
matter mediums. For this purpose, we use optical spacetime geometry to
calculate the Gaussian optical curvature, then implement the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem in weak field limits. Moreover, we compute the deflection angle by
using a technique known as Keeton and Petters technique. Furthermore, we
analyze the graphical behavior of the bending angle $\psi$ with respect to the
impact parameter $b$, mass $m$ as an integration constant, and parameter $q$ in
non-plasma and plasma mediums. We examine that the deflection angle is
exponentially increasing as direct with charge. Also, we observe that for small
values of $b$, $\psi$ increases, and for large values of $b$ the angle
decreases. We also considered analysis to the shadow cast of the wormhole
relative to an observer at various locations. Comparing it the Schwarzschild
shadow, shadow cast is possible for wormhole as $r<2m$. At $r>2m$, the
Schwarzschild is larger. As $r\to \infty$, we have seen that the behavior of
the shadow, as well as the weak deflection angle, approaches that of the
Schwarzschild black hole. Overall, the effect of plasma tends to decrease the
value of the observables due to the wormhole geometry.

Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The majority of the Milky Way's stellar halo consists of debris from our
Galaxy's last major merger, the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In the past few
years, stars from GSE have been kinematically and chemically studied in the
inner $30$ kpc of our Galaxy. However, simulations predict that accreted debris
could lie at greater distances, forming substructures in the outer halo. Here
we derive metallicities and distances using Gaia DR3 XP spectra for an all-sky
sample of luminous red giant stars, and map the outer halo with kinematics and
metallicities out to $100$ kpc. We obtain follow-up spectra of stars in two
strong overdensities - including the previously identified Outer Virgo
Overdensity - and find them to be relatively metal-rich and on predominantly
retrograde orbits, matching predictions from simulations of the GSE merger. We
argue that these are apocentric shells of GSE debris, forming $60-90$ kpc
counterparts to the $15-20$ kpc shells that are known to dominate the inner
stellar halo. Extending our search across the sky with literature radial
velocities, we find evidence for a coherent stream of retrograde stars
encircling the Milky Way from $50-100$ kpc, in the same plane as the
Sagittarius stream but moving in the opposite direction. These are the first
discoveries of distant and structured imprints from the GSE merger, cementing
the picture of an inclined and retrograde collision that built up our Galaxy's
stellar halo.

interaction and dissipation. In gaseous media, interactions between two
initially unbound objects could result in gas-assisted binary formation,
induced by a loss of kinetic energy to the ambient gas medium. Here we derive
analytically the criteria for gas-assisted binary capture through gas dynamical
friction dissipation. We validate them with few-body simulations and explore
this process in different gas-rich environments: gas-embedded star-forming
regions (SFR), gas-enriched globular clusters, AGN disks and
protoplanetary-disks. We find that gas-assisted binary capture is highly
efficient in SFRs, potentially providing a main channel for the formation of
binaries. It could also operate under certain conditions in gas-enriched
globular clusters. Thin AGN disks could also provide a fertile ground for
gas-assisted binary capture and in particular the formation of black-hole/other
compact object binaries, the production of gravitational-wave (GW) and other
high-energy transients. Large-scale gaseous disks might be too thick to enable
gas-assisted binary capture and previous estimates of the production of
GW-sources could be overestimated, and sensitive to specific conditions and the
structure of the disks. In protoplanetary-disks, while gas-assisted binary
capture can produce binary KBOs, dynamical friction by small planetsimals is
likely to be more efficient. Overall, we show that gas-assisted binary
formation is robust and can contribute significantly to the binary formation
rate in many environments. In fact, the gas-assisted binary capture rates are
sufficiently high such that they will lead to multicaptures, and the formation
of higher multiplicity systems.

evolution history, with 72 +10/-12% of its stars strongly enhanced in r-process
elements. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of Ret II and
analyze its star formation history. As in other ultra-faint dwarfs, the
color-magnitude diagram is best fit by a model consisting of two bursts of star
formation. If we assume that the bursts were instantaneous, then the older
burst occurred around the epoch of reionization and formed ~80% of the stars in
the galaxy, while the remainder of the stars formed ~3 Gyr later. When the
bursts are allowed to have nonzero durations we obtain slightly better fits.
The best-fitting model in this case consists of two bursts beginning before
reionization, with approximately half the stars formed in a short (100 Myr)
burst and the other half in a more extended period lasting 2.6 Gyr. Considering
the full set of viable star formation history models, we find that 28% of the
stars formed within 500 +/- 200 Myr of the onset of star formation. The
combination of the star formation history and the prevalence of
r-process-enhanced stars demonstrates that the r-process elements in Ret II
must have been synthesized early in its initial star-forming phase. We
therefore constrain the delay time between the formation of the first stars in
Ret II and the r-process nucleosynthesis to be less than 500 Myr. This
measurement rules out an r-process source with a delay time of several Gyr or
more such as GW170817.

population of bubbles that trace the stellar feedback mechanisms responsible
for their creation. Studying these bubbles therefore allows us to chart the
interaction between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium, and the
larger galactic flows needed to regulate star formation processes globally. We
present the first catalog of bubbles in NGC628, visually identified using MIRI
F770W PHANGS-JWST observations, and use them to statistically evaluate bubble
characteristics. We classify 1694 structures as bubbles with radii between
6-552 pc. Of these, 31% contain at least one smaller bubble at their edge,
indicating that previous generations of star formation have a local impact on
where new stars form. On large scales, most bubbles lie near a spiral arm, and
their radii increase downstream compared to upstream. Furthermore, bubbles are
elongated in a similar direction to the spiral arm ridge-line. These azimuthal
trends demonstrate that star formation is intimately connected to the spiral
arm passage. Finally, the bubble size distribution follows a power-law of index
$p=-2.2\pm0.1$, which is slightly shallower than the theoretical value by
1-3.5$\sigma$ that did not include bubble mergers. The fraction of bubbles
identified within the shells of larger bubbles suggests that bubble merging is
a common process. Our analysis therefore allows us to quantify the number of
star-forming regions that are influenced by an earlier generation, and the role
feedback processes have in setting the global star formation rate. With the
full PHANGS-JWST sample, we can do this for more galaxies.

treasury program, we perform a detailed case-study of two regions of interest,
one of which contains the largest and most prominent bubble in the galaxy (The
Phantom Void; over 1kpc in diameter), and the other being a smaller region that
may be the precursor to such a large bubble (The Precursor Phantom Void). When
comparing to matched resolution Halpha observations from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), we see that the ionized gas is brightest in the shells of both
bubbles, and is coincident with the youngest (~1Myr) and most massive
(~100,000Msun) stellar associations. We also find an older generation (~20Myr)
of stellar associations is present within the bubble of The Phantom Void. From
our kinematic analysis of the HI, H2 (CO) and HII gas across The Phantom Void,
we infer a high expansion speed of around 15 to 50km/s. The large size and high
expansion speed of The Phantom Void suggest that the driving mechanism is
sustained stellar feedback due to multiple mechanisms, where early feedback
first cleared a bubble (as we observe now in The Precursor Phantom Void), and
since then SNe have been exploding within the cavity, and have accelerated the
shell. Finally, comparison to simulations shows a striking resemblance to our
JWST observations, and suggests that such large-scale stellar feedback-driven
bubbles should be common within other galaxies.

syndromes and erasures. In particular, we introduce the \emph{logical gap} (and
variants thereof) as a powerful soft-information metric for predicting logical
error rates of fault-tolerant channels based on topological error-correcting
codes. The logical gap is roughly the unsigned weight difference between
inequivalent logical corrections and is adaptable to any tailored noise model
or decoder. We deploy this framework to prepare high-quality surface code magic
states with low overhead under a model of independent and identically
distributed (\emph{i.i.d.}) Pauli and erasure errors. Post-selection strategies
based on the logical gap can suppress the encoding error rate of a magic state
preparation channel to the level of the physical error rate with low overhead.
For example, when operating at $60\%$ the bulk threshold of the corresponding
surface code, an overall reduction of the encoding error rate by a factor of
$15$ is achievable with a relative overhead factor of ${< 2}$ (approximately
$23$ times less than that of simple syndrome-counting rules). We analyze a
schematic buffer architecture for implementing post-selection rules on magic
state factories in the context of magic state distillation. The FTPS framework
can be utilized for mitigating errors in more general fault-tolerant logical
channels.

HCO+ intensities are depressed relative to HCN intensities. Only a small

HCO, yet a significant fraction of even that gas appears to be translucent

significant mechanical heating. The molecular gas sampled by HCN and HCO+ has
low kinetic temperatures T(kin)=10-50 K, low densities n(H)=10^4-10^5 cm^(-3),

has densities lower by one to two orders of magnitude. For a mechanical heating
fraction of 0.5, a modest energy input of only G=300 Go is required. A proper
understanding of star formation requires a more appropriate determination of
the gas mass than provided by the intensities of individual HCN or CO

work, spin-polarization and electronic structure of surface states of
(111)-oriented Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se TCI epitaxial films are examined by angle --
as well as spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SR-ARPES). High-quality
epilayers with various Sn content are grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
method. Topological-normal insulator transition manifesting itself as band gap
opening is observed. It is shown that the gap opening can be induced not only
by changing the Sn content of the epilayer but also depositing a transition
metal (TM) on its surface. In the latter case, the observed gaping of the
surface states is caused by change in surface composition and not by magnetism.
We also show that helical spin polarization is present not only for samples of
topological composition but also for trivial ones (with an open band gap). The
observed spin polarization reaches a value of 30 % for the in-plane spin

mJ energy with ultrahigh contrast (<10^-10), and 10^19 W/cm^2 peak intensity
with foil targets made of various materials and thicknesses at normal
(0-degree) and 45-degree laser incidence is investigated. The maximum energy of

above 1 MeV. A conversion efficiency from laser pulse energy to proton beam is
estimated to be as high as ~1.4 % at 45-degree laser incidence using a 51

vacuum heating via the Brunels effect as an absorption mechanism involving a
tiny pre-plasma of natural origin due to the Gaussian temporal laser pulse
shape. Experimental results are in reasonable agreement with theoretical
estimates where proton acceleration from the target rear into the forward
direction is well explained by a TNSA-like mechanism, while proton acceleration
from the target front into the backward direction can be explained by the
formation of a charged cavity in a tiny pre-plasma. The exploding Coulomb field
from the charged cavity also serves as a source for forward-accelerated ions at

turbulence in this molecular cloud is driven at large scales. Analysis of the
centroid velocity structure functions indicate that the turbulence is dominated
by shocks rather than local (in k-space) transport of energy. We further find
that length-scales in the range 0.02 - 0.03 pc are important in the dynamics of
this cloud and this finding is supported by analysis of the dominant emission
structure length-scale. These length-scales are well resolved by the
observational data and we conclude that the apparent importance of this range
of scales is physical in origin. Given that it is also well within the range
strongly influenced by ambipolar diffusion, we conclude that it is not
primarily a product of turbulence alone, but is more likely to be a result of
the interplay between gravity and turbulence. Finally, through comparison of
these results with previous observations of H2 emission from the Western Wall
we demonstrate that observations of a PDR can be used to probe the internal

Prominent ferromagnetic ordering is observed in the sample with a rhombohedral

mechanism mediated by itinerant electrons. Further, the Curie temperature is
smaller for the high-entropy sample with \textit{x}=0.3, as compared to

is larger than those of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$, which can be ascribed to the
reduced bandwidth due to the enhanced structural distortion. A concomitant rise

At late times, the slow modes correspond to hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and
are naturally gapped from the fast modes by the inverse of the relaxation time,
$\tau_R^{-1}$. At early times, however, there are an infinite number of slow
modes with a gap inversely proportional to time, $\tau^{-1}$. From the

UniT3D enables learning a strong multimodal representation across the two tasks
through a supervised joint pre-training scheme with bidirectional and
seq-to-seq objectives. With a generic architecture design, UniT3D allows
expanding the pre-training scope to more various training sources such as the
synthesized data from 2D prior knowledge to benefit 3D vision-language tasks.
Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that UniT3D obtains significant

  Association","Accepted by EMNLP 2022 main conference",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Math word problem (MWP) solving is an important task in question answering
which requires human-like reasoning ability. Analogical reasoning has long been
used in mathematical education, as it enables students to apply common
relational structures of mathematical situations to solve new problems. In this
paper, we propose to build a novel MWP solver by leveraging analogical MWPs,
which advance the solver's generalization ability across different kinds of
MWPs. The key idea, named analogy identification, is to associate the
analogical MWP pairs in a latent space, i.e., encoding an MWP close to another
analogical MWP, while moving away from the non-analogical ones. Moreover, a
solution discriminator is integrated into the MWP solver to enhance the
association between the representations of MWPs and their true solutions. The
evaluation results verify that our proposed analogical learning strategy
promotes the performance of MWP-BERT on Math23k over the state-of-the-art model
Generate2Rank, with 5 times fewer parameters in the encoder. We also find that
our model has a stronger generalization ability in solving difficult MWPs due
to the analogical learning from easy MWPs.

agents to reduce task completion time by performing tasks in a distributed

distribution of tasks on the completion time and communication cost of the
algorithms. In this paper, we examine an environment where agents must explore

complete all such tasks. We first provide a new discrete general model for

new task allocation algorithms for initially unknown environments -- one based
on N-site selection and the other on virtual pheromones. We analyze each
algorithm separately and also evaluate the effectiveness of the two algorithms
in dense vs. sparse task distributions. Compared to the Levy walk, which has
been theorized to be optimal for foraging, our virtual pheromone inspired
algorithm is much faster in sparse to medium task densities but is
communication and agent intensive. Our site selection inspired algorithm also
outperforms Levy walk in sparse task densities and is a less resource-intensive
option than our virtual pheromone algorithm for this case. Because the
performance of both algorithms relative to random walk is dependent on task
density, our results shed light on how task density is important in choosing a

property was enjoyed by some definitions but not others. I show here that the
twistor definition has this continuity. The argument is rather different from
Chen et al.'s, with the invariant geometry of scri at the forefront. The flux,
in the sense of the angular momentum emitted between two infinitesimally
separated cuts, is calculated; this flux can be interpreted as the first
variation of the angular momentum with respect to the cut. Examining the second
variation, one finds that the twistor definition, unlike most others, responds
to correlations in radiation between different asymptotic directions. The
twistor angular momentum is thus sensitive to qualitatively different structure
in the asymptotic field than are the currently more used ones.

Our goal is to forecast the future evolution of ensembles of multivariate time

the future popularity of a Twitter account). Designing ML algorithms for such
systems requires addressing the challenges of high-dimensional interactions and
non-linearity. Existing approaches usually adopt an ad-hoc approach to
integrating high-dimensional techniques into non-linear models and recent
studies have shown these approaches have questionable efficacy in time-evolving
interacting systems.
  To this end, we propose a novel framework, which we dub as the additive
influence model. Under our modeling assumption, we show that it is possible to
decouple the learning of high-dimensional interactions from the learning of
non-linear feature interactions. To learn the high-dimensional interactions, we
leverage kernel-based techniques, with provable guarantees, to embed the
entities in a low-dimensional latent space. To learn the non-linear
feature-response interactions, we generalize prominent machine learning
techniques, including designing a new statistically sound non-parametric method
and an ensemble learning algorithm optimized for vector regressions. Extensive
experiments on two common applications demonstrate that our new algorithms
deliver significantly stronger forecasting power compared to standard and

such systems, finding in many cases excellent agreement with experimental

odd-frequency superconductivity to predict new phenomena associated with this
form of unconventional pairing. We establish necessary criteria that the
quasiclassical Green functions in odd-frequency superconducting systems in the
dirty limit must satisfy in order to be physically reasonable, including
conservation of spectral weight. We show that it is possible to write down
effective models which satisfy all the abovementioned criteria, but which still
predict different behavior when it comes to the density of states and the
magnetic response of the superconductor. For instance, an effective model for
the odd-frequency anomalous Green function that gives a conserved spectral

online implementation, robustness to channel impairments, and joint
optimization with channel acquisition. However, existing neural networks suffer
from high training complexity and poor generalization ability when they are
used to learn to optimize precoding for mitigating multi-user interference.
This impedes their use in practical systems where the number of users is
time-varying. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) to learn
precoding policies by harnessing both the mathematical model and the property
of the policies. We first show that a vanilla GNN cannot well-learn
pseudo-inverse of channel matrix when the numbers of antennas and users are
large, and is not generalizable to unseen numbers of users. Then, we design a
GNN by resorting to the Taylor's expansion of matrix pseudo-inverse, which
allows for capturing the importance of the neighbored edges to be aggregated
that is crucial for learning precoding policies efficiently. Simulation results
show that the proposed GNN can well learn spectral efficient and energy
efficient precoding policies in single- and multi-cell multi-user multi-antenna
systems with low training complexity, and can be well generalized to the

disentangle good advice from bad, and balance the potential benefits of shared
wisdom against the risks of being misled. Groups are most effective at sharing
information and solving problems together when everyone is sensitive to ``who
knows what.'' Acquiring such knowledge in the first place, however, is not
trivial -- especially in contexts where background information is limited. What
underlying cognitive abilities are needed for social learning to be useful in
information-limited environments? Here, we propose that the capacity for
flexible social inference plays a key role in human group behavior, allowing
latent properties such as success or skill to be inferred from others' outward
behavior even when there is no direct access to others' private rewards and
""success"" manifests differently from context to context. We begin by
formalizing our proposal in a cognitive model and comparing this model's
predictions against those of simpler heuristics in a series of computational
simulations. We then evaluated these predictions in three large-scale
behavioral experiments using a multi-agent search paradigm with hidden rewards.
In Experiment 1, we found that average performance improves as a function of
group size at a rate predicted by our model but not by three simpler
alternatives. In Experiment 2, we placed human participants in controlled
scenarios with artificial agents to more systematically evaluate the conditions
under which people choose to rely on social information. Finally, in Experiment
3, we generalized these findings to a more complex and noisy environment,
suggesting regimes where inferences may break down. Taken together, we find
that even the most rudimentary social cognition abilities may facilitate the
characteristic flexibility of human collective behavior.

inconsistent patterns across introductory science and engineering courses.
Toward finding the source of this variation, we examine whether a gender bias
exists in students' nominations of strong peers across three different remote,
introductory physics courses with varying student populations (varying
demographics, majors, and course levels). We also uniquely evaluate possible
racial/ethnic biases and probe the relationship between instructional context
(whether lecture or laboratory) and recognition. Some of our results replicate
previous findings (such as the the association of course grade and small class
section enrollment with nominations), while others offer contradictions.
Comparing across our three courses and the prior work, results suggest that
course level (whether first-year students or beyond-first-year students) might
be more associated with a gender bias in peer recognition than other variables.
Surprisingly, we also find instances of racial/ethnic biases in favor of
students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in science. Finally, we
find that the nomination patterns differ when students nominate individuals
strong in the lecture material versus laboratory material. This work serves as
an important step in determining which courses and contexts exhibit biases in
peer recognition, as well as how students' perceptions of one another form in
remote teaching environments.

previous studies of in-person courses, we find that remote lecture interaction
networks contain large clusters connecting many students, while remote lab
interaction networks contain smaller clusters of a few students. Our

a combination of both instruction-level and student-level variables, including
the learning goals of each instructional context, whether assignments are
completed in groups or individually, and the distribution of gender and major

Brahe, SN 1572, can be explained in the terms used nowadays to characterize
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). By assembling the records of the observations made
in 1572--74 and evaluating their uncertainties, it is possible to recover the
light curve and the color evolution of this supernova. It is found that, within
the SNe Ia family, the event should have been a SN Ia with a normal rate of
decline. Concerning the color evolution of SNe Ia, the most recently recovered
records reaffirm previous findings of its being a normal SN Ia. The abundance
studies from X--ray spectroscopy of the whole remnant point to a nuclear
burning of the kind of a delayed detonation explosion of a Chandrasekhar--mass
white dwarf. A tentative single degenerate path to explosion was suggested from
the exploration of the stars in the field in SN 1572. Though, the origin in a
double degenerate is being considered as well. Tycho Brahe's supernova, being
the first supernova studied by astronomers, is still the subject of very
intensive debates nowadays.

with various types of internal and external processes. While the equilibrium
orientation of a tidally locked body is well understood, much less explored are
the dynamics of the reorientation process (or true polar wander, TPW, used here
for the motion of either the rotation or the tidal pole). This is despite their
importance for predicting the patterns of TPW-induced surface fractures, and
for assessing whether enough time has passed for the equilibrium orientation to
be reached. The only existing, and relatively complex numerical method for an
accurate evaluation of the reorientation dynamics of a tidally locked body was
described in a series of papers by Hu et al. (2017a,b, 2019). Here we
demonstrate that an identical solution can be obtained with a simple approach,
denoted as ow||mMIA, because, contrary to previous claims, during TPW the tidal
and the rotation axes closely follow respectively the minor and the major axes
of the total, time-evolving inertia tensor. Motivated by the presumed
reorientation of Pluto, the use of the ow||mMIA method is illustrated on
several test examples. In particular, we analyze whether reorientation paths
are curved or straight when the load sign and the mass of the host body are
varied. When tidal forcing is relatively small, the paths of negative anomalies
(e.g.~basins) towards the rotation pole are highly curved, while positive loads
may reach the sub- or anti-host point in a straightforward manner. Our results
suggest that the Sputnik Planitia basin cannot be a negative anomaly at present
day, and that the remnant figure of Pluto must have formed prior to the
reorientation. Finally, the presented method is complemented with an energy
balance that can be used to test the numerical solution.

methods to problems in engineering mechanics. In particular, there has been
significant interest in applying deep learning techniques to predicting the
mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials and structures. Researchers have
shown that deep learning methods are able to effectively predict mechanical
behavior with low error for systems ranging from engineered composites, to
geometrically complex metamaterials, to heterogeneous biological tissue.
However, there has been comparatively little attention paid to deep learning
model calibration, i.e., the match between predicted probabilities of outcomes
and the true probabilities of outcomes. In this work, we perform a
comprehensive investigation into ML model calibration across seven open access
engineering mechanics datasets that cover three distinct types of mechanical
problems. Specifically, we evaluate both model and model calibration error for
multiple machine learning methods, and investigate the influence of ensemble
averaging and post hoc model calibration via temperature scaling. Overall, we
find that ensemble averaging of deep neural networks is both an effective and
consistent tool for improving model calibration, while temperature scaling has
comparatively limited benefits. Looking forward, we anticipate that this
investigation will lay the foundation for future work in developing mechanics
specific approaches to deep learning model calibration.

predict the response of multi-material, multi-physics problems with complex
geometries using locally refined discretizations. To circumvent the need to
generate conformal meshes, this work uses an eXtended Finite Element Method
(XFEM) to discretize the governing equations on non-conforming, embedding
meshes. A flexible approach to create truncated hierarchical B-splines
discretizations is presented. This approach enables the refinement of each
state variable field individually to meet field-specific accuracy requirements.
To obtain an immersed geometry representation that is consistent across all
hierarchically refined B-spline discretizations, the geometry is immersed into
a single mesh, the XFEM background mesh, which is constructed from the union of
all hierarchical B-spline meshes. An extraction operator is introduced to
represent the truncated hierarchical B-spline bases in terms of Lagrange shape
functions on the XFEM background mesh without loss of accuracy. The truncated
hierarchical B-spline bases are enriched using a generalized Heaviside
enrichment strategy to accommodate small geometric features and multi-material
problems. The governing equations are augmented by a formulation of the
face-oriented ghost stabilization enhanced for locally refined B-spline bases.
We present examples for two- and three-dimensional linear elastic and
thermo-elastic problems. The numerical results validate the accuracy of our
framework. The results also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
framework to large, geometrically complex problems.

study the characteristics of using nano-based biocompatible materials as
systems that can facilitate this task while ensuring appropriate self-sealing
of the cell membrane. Here, we study the effects of indentation and withdrawal
of nanospear on phospholipid membrane by applying steered molecular dynamics
(SMD) technique. Our results show that the withdrawal process directly depends
on the initial position of the nanocone. The average force and work are
considerably more significant in case of the withdrawal starting from a larger
depth. This result is attributed to stronger hydrophobic interactions between
the nanocone and lipid tails of the membrane molecules. Furthermore, when the
indenter was started from the lower initial depth, the number of lipids removed
from the membrane was several times smaller than the deeper indentation. The
choice of the least invasive method for nanostructure-assisted drug delivery is
crucial for possible applications in medicine. Therefore, the results presented
in this work might be helpful in efficient and safe drug delivery with
nanomaterials.

diffusion models to operate directly in function space by developing the
foundational theory for such models in terms of Gaussian measures on Hilbert
spaces. A significant benefit of our function space point of view is that it
allows us to explicitly specify the space of functions we are working in,
leading us to develop methods for diffusion generative modeling in Sobolev
spaces. Our approach allows us to perform both unconditional and conditional
generation of function-valued data. We demonstrate our methods on several

quantitative descriptors of particle morphology through scanning electron

oxides. We utilize a VQ-VAE to quantitatively describe plutonium dioxide (PuO2)
particles created in a designed experiment and investigate their phenomenology
and prediction of their process parameters. PuO2 was calcined from Pu(III)
oxalates that were precipitated under varying synthetic conditions that related
to concentrations, temperature, addition and digestion times, precipitant feed,
and strike order; the surface morphology of the resulting PuO2 powders were
analyzed by SEM. A pipeline was developed to extract and quantify useful image
representations for individual particles with the VQ-VAE to perform multiple
classification tasks simultaneously. The reduced feature space could predict
process parameters with greater than 80% accuracies for some parameters with a
single particle. They also showed utility for grouping particles with similar
surface morphology characteristics together. Both the clustering and
classification results reveal valuable information regarding which chemical
process parameters chiefly influence the PuO2 particle morphologies: strike
order and oxalic acid feedstock. Doing the same analysis with multiple
particles was shown to improve the classification accuracy on each process
parameter over the use of a single particle, with statistically significant
results generally seen with as few as four particles in a sample.

wildly deployed but remaining largely opaque, developers frequently use
explainable RL (XRL) tools to better understand and work with deep RL agents.
However, previous XRL works employ a techno-centric research approach, ignoring
how RL developers perceive the generated explanations. Through a pilot study,
we identify major goals for RL practitioners to use XRL methods and four
pitfalls that widen the gap between existing XRL methods and these goals. The
pitfalls include inaccessible reasoning processes, inconsistent or
unintelligible explanations, and explanations that cannot be generalized. To
fill the discovered gap, we propose a counterfactual-inference-based
explanation method that discovers the details of the reasoning process of RL
agents and generates natural language explanations. Surrounding this method, we
build an interactive XRL system where users can actively explore explanations
and influential information. In a user study with 14 participants, we validated
that developers identified 20.9% more abnormal behaviors and limitations of RL
agents with our system compared to the baseline method, and using our system
helped end users improve their performance in actionability tests by 25.1% in
an auto-driving task and by 16.9% in a StarCraft II micromanagement task.

devices. It also serves as the prominent tool for testing the
indistinguishability of distinct photons. However, as their time-spectral
profile becomes more involved, extracting relevant parameters, foremost the
central frequency difference, may start suffering difficulties. In a parametric
approach, these arise from the need for an exhaustive model combined with
limited count statistics. Here we discuss a solution to curtail these effects
on the evaluation of frequency separation relying on a semiparametric method.
The time trace of the quantum interference pattern of two photons from two
independent solid-state emitters is preprocessed by means of singular spectral
analysis before inspecting its spectral content. This approach allows to single
out the relevant oscillations from both the envelope and the noise, without
resorting to fitting. This opens the way for robust and efficient on-line

quantum many-body systems. Quantum simulation experiments with cold atoms have
in recent years advanced our understanding of isolated quasiparticles, but so
far they have provided limited information regarding their interactions and
possible bound states. Here, we show how exploring mobile impurities immersed
in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a two-dimensional lattice can address
this problem. First, the spectral properties of individual impurities are
examined, and in addition to the attractive and repulsive polarons known from
continuum gases, we identify a new kind of quasiparticle stable for repulsive
boson-impurity interactions. The spatial properties of polarons are calculated
showing that there is an increased density of bosons at the site of the
impurity both for repulsive and attractive interactions. We then derive an
effective Schr\""odinger equation describing two polarons interacting via the
exchange of density oscillations in the BEC, which takes into account strong
impurity-boson two-body correlations. Using this, we show that the attractive
nature of the effective interaction between two polarons combined with the
two-dimensionality of the lattice leads to the formation of bound states --
i.e. bipolarons. The wave functions of the bipolarons are examined showing that
the ground state is symmetric under particle exchange and therefore relevant
for bosonic impurities, whereas the first excited state is doubly degenerate
and odd under particle exchange making it relevant for fermionic impurities.
Our results show that quantum gas microscopy in optical lattices is a promising
platform to explore the spatial properties of polarons as well as to finally
observe the elusive bipolarons.

Toward the objective of learning composite models of such systems from data, we

train these models, iii) a method to compose the learned models, iv)
theoretical results that bound the error of the resulting composite models, and
v) a method to learn the composition itself, when it is not known a priori. The
end result is a modular approach to learning: neural network submodels are
trained on trajectory data generated by relatively simple subsystems, and the
dynamics of more complex composite systems are then predicted without requiring
additional data generated by the composite systems themselves. We achieve this
compositionality by representing the system of interest, as well as each of its
subsystems, as a port-Hamiltonian neural network (PHNN) -- a class of neural
ordinary differential equations that uses the port-Hamiltonian systems
formulation as inductive bias. We compose collections of PHNNs by using the
system's physics-informed interconnection structure, which may be known a
priori, or may itself be learned from data. We demonstrate the novel
capabilities of the proposed framework through numerical examples involving
interacting spring-mass-damper systems. Models of these systems, which include
nonlinear energy dissipation and control inputs, are learned independently.
Accurate compositions are learned using an amount of training data that is
negligible in comparison with that required to train a new model from scratch.
Finally, we observe that the composite PHNNs enjoy properties of
port-Hamiltonian systems, such as cyclo-passivity -- a property that is useful
for control purposes.

theoretical physics. Presumably the problem arises from the insistent use of
effective field theory reasoning in a context that is well beyond its intended
scope. If one follows this path, one is led inevitably to statistical or
anthropic reasoning for observations. It appears that a more palatable
resolution of the vacuum energy problem requires some form of UV/IR feedback.
In this paper we take the point of view that such feedback can be thought of as
arising by defining a notion of quantum space-time. We reformulate the
regularized computation of vacuum energy in such a way that it can be
interpreted in terms of a sum over elementary phase space volumes, that we
identify with a ground state degeneracy. This observation yields a precise
notion of UV/IR feedback, while leaving a scale unfixed. Here we argue that
holography can be thought to provide a key piece of information: we show that
equating this microscopic ground state degeneracy with macroscopic
gravitational entropy yields a prediction for the vacuum energy that can easily
be consistent with observations. Essentially, the smallness of the vacuum
energy is tied to the large size of the Universe. We discuss how within this
scenario notions of effective field theory can go so wrong.

correlated materials, such as HgTe, $\alpha$-Sn, and iridate compounds.
Previously, we have theoretically demonstrated that the Luttinger semimetal
exhibits surface states. In the present work, we theoretically study the
evolution of these surface states under symmetry-lowering perturbations:
compressive strain and bulk-inversion asymmetry (BIA). This system is quite
special in that each consecutive perturbation creates a new type of a semimetal
phase, resulting in a sequence of four semimetal phases, where each successive
phase arises by modification of the nodal structure of the previous phase:
under compressive strain, the Luttinger semimetal turns into a Dirac semimetal,
which under the linear-in-momentum BIA term turns into a line-node semimetal,
which under the cubic-in-momentum BIA terms turns into a Weyl semimetal. We
calculate the surface states within the generalized Luttinger model for these
four semimetal phases within a ``semi-analytical'' approach and fully analyze
the corresponding evolution of the surface states. Importantly, for this
sequence of four semimetal phases, there is a corresponding hierarchy of the
low-energy models describing the vicinities of the nodes. We derive most of
these models and demonstrate quantitative asymptotic agreement between the
surface-state spectra of some of them. This proves that the mechanisms
responsible for the surface states are fully contained in the low-energy models
within their validity ranges, once they are supplemented with proper boundary
conditions, and demonstrates that continuum models are perfectly applicable for
studying surface states.

While remarkable achievements have been obtained, they have exhibited
limitations in lacking awareness of: 1) the hierarchical dependencies between
functional zones and spatial grids; 2) the peer dependencies among functional
zones; and 3) human regulations to ensure the usability of generated
configurations. To address these limitations, we develop a novel
human-instructed deep hierarchical generative model. We rethink the urban
planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we
summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for
better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation
process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the
grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional
zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban
functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project
the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level
plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of
land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in

projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present

spurious correlations between labels and task-independent input features,
resulting in poor generalization to distributional shifts. Group
distributionally robust optimization (G-DRO) can alleviate this problem by
minimizing the worst-case loss over a set of pre-defined groups over training
data. G-DRO successfully improves performance of the worst-group, where the
correlation does not hold. However, G-DRO assumes that the spurious
correlations and associated worst groups are known in advance, making it
challenging to apply it to new tasks with potentially multiple unknown spurious
correlations. We propose AGRO -- Adversarial Group discovery for
Distributionally Robust Optimization -- an end-to-end approach that jointly
identifies error-prone groups and improves accuracy on them. AGRO equips G-DRO
with an adversarial slicing model to find a group assignment for training
examples which maximizes worst-case loss over the discovered groups. On the
WILDS benchmark, AGRO results in 8% higher model performance on average on
known worst-groups, compared to prior group discovery approaches used with
G-DRO. AGRO also improves out-of-distribution performance on SST2, QQP, and
MS-COCO -- datasets where potential spurious correlations are as yet
uncharacterized. Human evaluation of ARGO groups shows that they contain
well-defined, yet previously unstudied spurious correlations that lead to model
errors.

environments like our homes, schools, and hospitals. Many learning-based
approaches have been proposed in response to the lack of semantic understanding
of the classical pipeline for spatial navigation, which builds a geometric map
using depth sensors and plans to reach point goals. Broadly, end-to-end
learning approaches reactively map sensor inputs to actions with deep neural
networks, while modular learning approaches enrich the classical pipeline with
learning-based semantic sensing and exploration. But learned visual navigation
policies have predominantly been evaluated in simulation. How well do different
classes of methods work on a robot? We present a large-scale empirical study of
semantic visual navigation methods comparing representative methods from
classical, modular, and end-to-end learning approaches across six homes with no
prior experience, maps, or instrumentation. We find that modular learning works
well in the real world, attaining a 90% success rate. In contrast, end-to-end
learning does not, dropping from 77% simulation to 23% real-world success rate
due to a large image domain gap between simulation and reality. For
practitioners, we show that modular learning is a reliable approach to navigate
to objects: modularity and abstraction in policy design enable Sim-to-Real
transfer. For researchers, we identify two key issues that prevent today's
simulators from being reliable evaluation benchmarks - (A) a large Sim-to-Real
gap in images and (B) a disconnect between simulation and real-world error
modes - and propose concrete steps forward.

Dataset biases have been a major
cause of unfairness in deep generative models. Previous work had proposed to

this setup, a weakly-supervised approach has been proposed, which achieves
state-of-the-art quality and fairness in generated samples. In our work, based

we propose fairTL, a transfer learning approach to learn fair generative
models. Under fairTL, we pre-train the generative model with the available
large, biased datasets and subsequently adapt the model using the small,
unbiased reference dataset. We find that our fairTL can learn expressive sample
generation during pre-training, thanks to the large (biased) dataset. This
knowledge is then transferred to the target model during adaptation, which also
learns to capture the underlying fair distribution of the small reference
dataset. Second, we propose fairTL++, where we introduce two additional
innovations to improve upon fairTL: (i) multiple feedback and (ii)
Linear-Probing followed by Fine-Tuning (LP-FT). Taking one step further, we
consider an alternative, challenging setup when only a pre-trained (potentially
biased) model is available but the dataset that was used to pre-train the model
is inaccessible. We demonstrate that our proposed fairTL and fairTL++ remain
very effective under this setup. We note that previous work requires access to
the large, biased datasets and is incapable of handling this more challenging
setup. Extensive experiments show that fairTL and fairTL++ achieve
state-of-the-art in both quality and fairness of generated samples. The code

blocks of triply periodic network crystals, like the double-gyroid or
double-diamond structures are obscured by the complex, bicontinuous domain

example of diblock copolymer melts, we propose generic rules for decomposing
triply-periodic network crystals into a unique set of mesoatomic building
blocks, leading to mesoatomic volumes that are non-convex and bound by smoothly
curved faces, unlike the more familiar polyhedral shapes associated with
sphere- and cylinder-like mesoatoms. We analyze the shapes of these mesoatoms,
their internal structure and importantly their local packing with neighbor

monolithic servers will spend up to 12.4x total cost of ownership (TCO) to meet
the requirement of model size and complexity over the next three years.
Moreover, through in-depth characterization, we reveal that the monolithic
server-based cluster suffers resource idleness and wastes up to 30% TCO by
provisioning resources in fixed proportions. To address this challenge, we
propose DisaggRec, a disaggregated system for large-scale recommendation
serving. DisaggRec achieves the independent decoupled scaling-out of the
compute and memory resources to match the changing demands from fast-evolving
workloads. It also improves system reliability by segregating the failures of
compute nodes and memory nodes. These two main benefits from disaggregation
collectively reduce the TCO by up to 49.3%. Furthermore, disaggregation enables
flexible and agile provisioning of increasing hardware heterogeneity in future
datacenters. By deploying new hardware featuring near-memory processing

One vital cause deteriorating the localization performance is the inevitable
power dissipation along the propagation path of localization signals. In this
paper, we propose a high-accuracy localization scheme based on the resonant
beam system (RBS) and the binocular vision, i.e., binocular based resonant beam
localization (BRBL). The BRBL system utilizes the energy-concentrated and
self-aligned transmission of RBS to realize high-efficiency signal propagation

to obtain the three-dimensional (3-D) coordinates of the target for the first

binocular localization model, including the resonant beam transmission analysis
and the geometric derivation of the binocular method with RBS. Then, we
establish the power model of RBS, and the signal and noise models of beam spot
imaging, respectively, to analyse the performance of the BRBL system. Finally,
the numerical results show an outstanding performance of centimeter level

multiple outstanding challenges, including the exceedingly high dimensionality
of the PES and that PES must be constructed from a reliable, sophisticated,
parameters-free, and thus, very expensive computational method, for which
density functional theory (DFT) is an example. DFT is a quantum mechanics based
method that can predict, among other things, the total potential energy of a
given configuration of atoms. DFT, while accurate, is computationally
expensive. In this work, we propose a novel expansion-exploration-exploitation
framework to find the global minimum of the PES. Starting from a few atomic
configurations, this ``known'' space is expanded to construct a big candidate
set. The expansion begins in a non-adaptive manner, where new configurations
are added without considering their potential energy. A novel feature of this
step is that it tends to generate a space-filling design without the knowledge
of the boundaries of the domain space. If needed, the non-adaptive expansion of
the space of configurations is followed by adaptive expansion, where
``promising regions'' of the domain space (those with low energy
configurations) are further expanded. Once a candidate set of configurations is
obtained, it is simultaneously explored and exploited using Bayesian
optimization to find the global minimum. The methodology is demonstrated using
a problem of finding the most stable crystal structure of Aluminum.

Perhaps one of the most intriguing questions concerns with the realization of

transfer, as the coupling (hybridization) energy, $J$, between the donor and
acceptor is varied. Here, using colloidal quantum dot molecules, a new class of
coupled quantum dot dimers, we computationally demonstrate how the

provides a handle to tune the electron transfer from the nonadiabatic

utilize the Ehrenfest mean-field mixed quantum-classical method to describe the
charge transfer dynamics as the nonadiabatic parameter, $\gamma$, is varied. We
find that charge transfer rates increase by several orders of magnitude as the

emergence latitudes of sunspots as the solar cycle evolves. Revealing the
mechanism for the butterfly diagram is essential for understanding the solar
and stellar dynamo. The equatorward meridional flow at the base of the
convection zone (CZ) was believed to be responsible for the butterfly diagram.
However, helioseismological studies indicate controversial forms of the flow,
and even present poleward flow at the base of the CZ, which poses a big
challenge to the widely accepted mechanism. This motivates us to propose a new
mechanism in this study. Using a data-driven Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo
model, we carry out numerical simulations to explore how the latitude-dependent
radial flux transport affects the latitudinal migration of the toroidal field,
under different meridional flow profiles. The results indicate that when the
radial transport of the poloidal field at higher latitudes is sufficiently
faster, the toroidal fields of a new cycle at higher latitudes are generated
earlier than that at lower latitudes, and vice versa. Thus, the butterfly
diagram is suggested to correspond to the time- and latitude-dependent
regeneration of the toroidal field due to the latitude-dependent radial
transport of the poloidal flux.

applying process knowledge, in the form of general-purpose software agents,

enables reasoning on multiple detected objects to ensure consistency, providing

  Answering Over Knowledge Graph","Camera-ready of ICLR 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graph~(KGQA) aims to find the
answer entities that are multiple hops away from the topic entities mentioned
in a natural language question on a large-scale Knowledge Graph (KG). To cope
with the vast search space, existing work usually adopts a two-stage approach:
it first retrieves a relatively small subgraph related to the question and then
performs the reasoning on the subgraph to find the answer entities accurately.
Although these two stages are highly related, previous work employs very
different technical solutions for developing the retrieval and reasoning
models, neglecting their relatedness in task essence. In this paper, we propose
UniKGQA, a novel approach for multi-hop KGQA task, by unifying retrieval and
reasoning in both model architecture and parameter learning. For model
architecture, UniKGQA consists of a semantic matching module based on a
pre-trained language model~(PLM) for question-relation semantic matching, and a
matching information propagation module to propagate the matching information
along the directed edges on KGs. For parameter learning, we design a shared
pre-training task based on question-relation matching for both retrieval and
reasoning models, and then propose retrieval- and reasoning-oriented
fine-tuning strategies. Compared with previous studies, our approach is more
unified, tightly relating the retrieval and reasoning stages. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of
our method on the multi-hop KGQA task. Our codes and data are publicly
available at~\url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UniKGQA}.

At vertices, in addition to mass balance, we also consider mixing of incoming

functions $F : \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} \times

backgrounds. One of the property is that $F$ is a Yang-Baxter map, namely it
satisfies the ""set-theoretical"" Yang-Baxter equation, and the other property is
the independence preserving property (IP property for short), which means that
there exist independent (non-constant) $\mathcal{X}$-valued random variables
$X,Y$ such that $U,V$ are also independent with $(U,V)=F(X,Y)$. Recently in the
study of invariant measures for a discrete integrable system, a class of
functions having these two properties were found. Motivated by this, we analyze
a relationship between the Yang-Baxter maps and the IP property, which has
never been studied as far as we are aware, focusing on the case
$\mathcal{X}=\mathbb{R}_+$. Our first main result is that all quadrirational
Yang-Baxter maps $F : \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+ \times
\mathbb{R}_+$ in the most interesting subclass have the independence preserving
property. In particular, we find new classes of bijections having the IP
property. Our second main result is that these newly introduce bijections are
fundamental in the class of (known) bijections with the IP property, in the
sense that most of known bijections having the IP property are derived from
these maps by taking special parameters or performing some limiting procedure.
This reveals that the IP property, which has been investigated for specific
functions individually, can be understood in a unified manner.

on the classification backbone network. This tends to result in tiny object
loss and feature distinguishability limitations as the network depth increases.
Furthermore, small objects in infrared images are frequently emerged bright and
dark, posing severe demands for obtaining precise object contrast information.
For this reason, we in this paper propose a simple and effective ``U-Net in
U-Net'' framework, UIU-Net for short, and detect small objects in infrared
images. As the name suggests, UIU-Net embeds a tiny U-Net into a larger U-Net
backbone, enabling the multi-level and multi-scale representation learning of
objects. Moreover, UIU-Net can be trained from scratch, and the learned
features can enhance global and local contrast information effectively. More
specifically, the UIU-Net model is divided into two modules: the
resolution-maintenance deep supervision (RM-DS) module and the
interactive-cross attention (IC-A) module. RM-DS integrates Residual U-blocks
into a deep supervision network to generate deep multi-scale
resolution-maintenance features while learning global context information.
Further, IC-A encodes the local context information between the low-level
details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments conducted on
two infrared single-frame image datasets, i.e., SIRST and Synthetic datasets,
show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UIU-Net in comparison
with several state-of-the-art infrared small object detection methods. The
proposed UIU-Net also produces powerful generalization performance for video

strong generalization capability on the cloud while they can not be deployed on

modalities. Symbolic music contains multiple attributes, both absolute
attributes (e.g., pitch) and relative attributes (e.g., pitch interval). These
relative attributes shape human perception of musical motifs. These important
relative attributes, however, are mostly ignored in existing symbolic music
modeling methods with the main reason being the lack of a musically-meaningful
embedding space where both the absolute and relative embeddings of the symbolic
music tokens can be efficiently represented. In this paper, we propose the
Fundamental Music Embedding (FME) for symbolic music based on a bias-adjusted
sinusoidal encoding within which both the absolute and the relative attributes
can be embedded and the fundamental musical properties (e.g., translational
invariance) are explicitly preserved. Taking advantage of the proposed FME, we
further propose a novel attention mechanism based on the relative index, pitch
and onset embeddings (RIPO attention) such that the musical domain knowledge
can be fully utilized for symbolic music modeling. Experiment results show that
our proposed model: RIPO transformer which utilizes FME and RIPO attention
outperforms the state-of-the-art transformers (i.e., music transformer, linear
transformer) in a melody completion task. Moreover, using the RIPO transformer
in a downstream music generation task, we notice that the notorious
degeneration phenomenon no longer exists and the music generated by the RIPO
transformer outperforms the music generated by state-of-the-art transformer
models in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Nonetheless, the present technique faces a considerable barrier to parallel due

address this problem, we provide a parallel shortest path counting method that
could avoid these dependencies and obtain approximately linear index time
speedup as the number of threads increases. Our empirical evaluations verify

A nonlinear photo-induced band shift of the Sm 4f multiplets was observed. The
first one is a shift to the high-binding-energy side due to a large surface
photovoltage (SPV) effect of approximately 93 meV, comparable to the size of
the bulk band gap, with a much longer relaxation time than 0.1 ms. The second
one is an ultrafast band shift to the low binding energy side, which is in the
opposite direction to the SPV shift, suggesting an ultrafast valence transition
from divalent to trivalent Sm ions due to photo-excitation. The latter energy
shift was approximately 58 meV, which is consistent with the energy gap shift
from ambient pressure to the boundary between the black insulator and golden
metallic phase with the application of pressure. This suggests that the
photo-induced valence transition can reach the phase boundary, but other

policies during a finite period of time. Given that insurance companies operate
with multiple lines of insurance business where the claim frequencies on
different lines of business are often correlated, multivariate count modeling
with dependence for claim frequency is therefore essential. Due in part to the
operation of bonus-malus systems, claims data in automobile insurance are often
characterized by an excess of common zeros. This feature is referred to as
multivariate zero-inflation. In this paper, we establish two ways of dealing
with this feature. The first is to use a multivariate zero-inflated model,
where we artificially augment the probability of common zeros based on standard
multivariate count distributions. The other is to apply a multivariate
zero-modified model, which deals with the common zeros and the number of claims
incurred in each line, given that at least one claim occurs separately. A
comprehensive comparative analysis of several models under these two frameworks
is conducted using the data of an automobile insurance portfolio from a major

of some common zeros resulting from incomplete records. This feature of these

masked-then-alignment paradigm for efficient video-text alignment. The
motivation is that video-text retrieval tasks rely on high-level alignment

representation from incomplete and unstable inputs. Coupling these designs
enables efficient end-to-end pre-training: reduce FLOPs (60% off), accelerate
pre-training (by 3x), and improve performance. Our MAC achieves

imperfectness of sample reweighting under the finite-sample setting in previous
methods. Furthermore, we organically combine independence-based sample
reweighting and sparsity-based variable selection in an iterative way to avoid
decorrelating within stable variables, increasing the effective sample size to
alleviate variance inflation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world

  Theory","9 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Credit assignment problem of neural networks refers to evaluating the credit
of each network component to the final outputs. For an untrained neural
network, approaches to tackling it have made great contributions to parameter
update and model revolution during the training phase. This problem on trained
neural networks receives rare attention, nevertheless, it plays an increasingly
important role in neural network patch, specification and verification. Based
on Koopman operator theory, this paper presents an alternative perspective of
linear dynamics on dealing with the credit assignment problem for trained
neural networks. Regarding a neural network as the composition of sub-dynamics
series, we utilize step-delay embedding to capture snapshots of each component,
characterizing the established mapping as exactly as possible. To circumvent
the dimension-difference problem encountered during the embedding, a
composition and decomposition of an auxiliary linear layer, termed minimal
linear dimension alignment, is carefully designed with rigorous formal
guarantee. Afterwards, each component is approximated by a Koopman operator and
we derive the Jacobian matrix and its corresponding determinant, similar to
backward propagation. Then, we can define a metric with algebraic
interpretability for the credit assignment of each network component. Moreover,
experiments conducted on typical neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

this paper, a dynamical systems theory approach is used to analyze the effect
of launch rate distribution on the stability of the LEO environment. A
multi-shell, three-species source-sink model of the LEO environment, referred
to as MOCAT-3 for MIT Orbital Capacity Assessment Tool 3 Species, is used to
study the evolution of the species populations. The three species included in
the model are active satellites, derelict satellites, and debris. The model's
coefficients represent atmospheric drag, collision rate, mean satellite
lifetime, post-mission disposal probability, and active debris removal rate.
Solutions of the system of differential equations are computed, and an analysis
of the stability of the equilibrium points is conducted for numerous launch
rate distributions. The stability of the equilibrium points is used to test the
sensitivity of the environment to run-away debris growth, known as Kessler
syndrome, that occurs at the instability threshold. An analysis of the
environment's response to perturbations in launch rate and debris population is
conducted. The maximum perturbation in the debris population from the
equilibrium state, for which the system remains in a stable configuration, is
calculated. Plots of the phase space about the equilibrium points are
generated. The results will help to better understand the orbital capacity of
LEO and the stability of the space environment, as well as provide improved
guidelines on future launch plans to avoid detrimental congestion of LEO.

small circuits with shallow depth, as they are still constrained by the

fragile due to decoherence. Hence, it is of great importance to optimize the
depth/gate-count when designing quantum circuits for specific tasks. Diagonal
unitary matrices are well-known to be key building blocks of many quantum
algorithms or quantum computing procedures. Prior work has discussed the
synthesis of diagonal unitary matrices over the primitive gate set
$\{\text{CNOT}, R_Z\}$. However, the problem has not yet been fully understood,
since the existing synthesis methods have not optimized the circuit depth.
  In this paper, we propose a depth-optimized synthesis algorithm that
automatically produces a quantum circuit for any given diagonal unitary matrix.
Specially, it not only ensures the asymptotically optimal gate-count, but also
nearly halves the total circuit depth compared with the previous method.
Technically, we discover a uniform circuit rewriting rule well-suited for
reducing the circuit depth. The performance of our synthesis algorithm is both
theoretically analyzed and experimentally validated by evaluations on two
examples. First, we achieve a nearly 50\% depth reduction over Welch's method
for synthesizing random diagonal unitary matrices with up to 16 qubits. Second,
we achieve an average of 22.05\% depth reduction for resynthesizing the
diagonal part of specific quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)

networks under long-tail data distribution using robust training algorithms

however, ignore the impact of data imbalance on feature normalization. The
dominance of majority classes (head classes) in estimating statistics and
affine parameters causes internal covariate shifts within less-frequent
categories to be overlooked. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a compound
batch normalization method based on a Gaussian mixture. It can model the
feature space more comprehensively and reduce the dominance of head classes. In
addition, a moving average-based expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is
employed to estimate the statistical parameters of multiple Gaussian
distributions. However, the EM algorithm is sensitive to initialization and can
easily become stuck in local minima where the multiple Gaussian components
continue to focus on majority classes. To tackle this issue, we developed a
dual-path learning framework that employs class-aware split feature
normalization to diversify the estimated Gaussian distributions, allowing the
Gaussian components to fit with training samples of less-frequent classes more
comprehensively. Extensive experiments on commonly used datasets demonstrated
that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on long-tailed image

observation finds that existing approaches face the following two issues: 1)
TML-based approaches require much manual feature engineering and cannot learn

are difficult to distinguish the semantic difference between bug reports with
different priorities. In this paper, we propose CLeBPI (Contrastive Learning

contrastive learning to tackle the above-mentioned two issues. Specifically,
CLeBPI is first pre-trained on a large-scale bug report corpus in a

of bug reports without manual feature engineering. Afterward, it is further
pre-trained by a contrastive learning objective, which enables it to
distinguish semantic differences between bug reports, learning more precise
contextual representations for each bug report. When finishing pre-training, we

perturbations evolving in the 1-D linearised Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation
and 2-D boundary layer flows. The former is commonly used to model the
disturbance developing in flat-plate boundary layer flows. These flow systems
are convectively unstable, being able to amplify the upstream disturbance, and
are thus difficult to control. The control action is implemented through a
volumetric force at a fixed position and the control performance is evaluated
by the reduction of perturbation amplitude downstream. We first demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DRL-based control in the KS system subjected to a random
upstream noise. The amplitude of perturbation monitored downstream is
significantly reduced and the learnt policy is shown to be robust to both
measurement and external noise. One of our focuses is to optimally place
sensors in the DRL control using the gradient-free particle swarm optimisation
algorithm. After the optimisation process for different numbers of sensors, a
specific eight-sensor placement is found to yield the best control performance.
The optimised sensor placement in the KS equation is applied directly to
control 2-D Blasius boundary layer flows and can efficiently reduce the
downstream perturbation energy. Via flow analyses, the control mechanism found
by DRL is the opposition control. Besides, it is found that when the flow
instability information is embedded in the reward function of DRL to penalise
the instability, the control performance can be further improved in this
convectively-unstable flow.

(FR). However, deep learning algorithms often make predictions with high
confidence even for uncertain or irrelevant inputs. Intuitively, FR algorithms
can benefit from both the estimation of uncertainty and the detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Taking a probabilistic view of the current
classification model, the temperature scalar is exactly the scale of
uncertainty noise implicitly added in the softmax function. Meanwhile, the
uncertainty of images in a dataset should follow a prior distribution. Based on
the observation, a unified framework for uncertainty modeling and FR, Random
Temperature Scaling (RTS), is proposed to learn a reliable FR algorithm. The
benefits of RTS are two-fold. (1) In the training phase, it can adjust the
learning strength of clean and noisy samples for stability and accuracy. (2) In
the test phase, it can provide a score of confidence to detect uncertain,
low-quality and even OOD samples, without training on extra labels. Extensive
experiments on FR benchmarks demonstrate that the magnitude of variance in RTS,
which serves as an OOD detection metric, is closely related to the uncertainty
of the input image. RTS can achieve top performance on both the FR and OOD
detection tasks. Moreover, the model trained with RTS can perform robustly on
datasets with noise. The proposed module is light-weight and only adds
negligible computation cost to the model.

Given a target property, the learned invertible model provides a posterior over
the parameter space; we identify these posterior samples as an intelligent

perform gradient descent to calibrate the inverse solutions within a local
region. Meanwhile, a space-filling sampling is imposed on the latent space to
better explore and capture all possible solutions. We evaluate our approach on

were discovered, such as the Tully-Fisher relation. However, many of the
relations found in galaxies are quite different from that found in galaxy
clusters. Here, we report two new mysterious universal relations connecting
dark matter and baryons in both galaxies and galaxy clusters. The first
relation indicates that the total dynamical mass of a galaxy or a galaxy
cluster $M_{500}$ has a power-law relation with its total baryonic mass $M_b$
within the `virial region': $M_{500} \propto M_b^a$, with $a \approx 3/4$. The
second relation indicates that the enclosed dynamical mass $M_d$ is almost
directly proportional to the baryonic mass for galaxies and galaxy clusters
within the central baryonic region: $M_d \propto M_b$. The close relations
between dark matter and baryons in both galaxies and galaxy clusters suggest
that some unknown interaction or interplay except gravity might exist between
dark matter and baryons.

proposed to mimic the effect of dark matter. Compared with the conventional
Newtonian or relativistic dynamics, these theories contain some extra apparent
force terms in the dynamical equations to replace the role of dark matter.
Generally speaking, the extra apparent force terms usually scale with radius so
that the effect would be significant only on large scale to explain the missing
mass in galaxies or galaxy clusters. Nevertheless, the apparent effect may
still be observable in small structures like the solar system. In this article,
we derive analytic general formulae to represent the contribution of the
precession angle of the planets in the solar system due to the general modified
gravity theories, in which the extra apparent force terms can be written in a
power law of radius $r$ or an exponential function in $r$. We have tested three
popular modified gravity theories, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the
Emergent Gravity (EG), and the Modified Gravity (MOG). In particular, based on
the solar system data, we have constrained the parameters involved for two
popular general interpolating functions used in MOND. Our results can be
generally applied to both of the modified inertia and modified gravity versions
of MOND.

oriented two dimensional lattices. Here we construct analogous models with the
gauge fields belonging to groupoids, which are categories where every morphism
has an inverse. We show that a consistent system can be constructed for an
arbitrary groupoid and analyze the simplest example that can be seen as the
analog of the Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code. We find several exactly
solvable models that have fracton-like features which include an extensive
ground state degeneracy and excitations that are either immobile or have
restricted mobility. Among the possibilities we study in detail the one where
the ground state degeneracy scales as $2\times 2^{N_v}$, where $N_v$ is the
number of vertices in the lattice. The origin of this degeneracy can be traced
to loop operators supported on both contractible and non-contractible loops. In
particular, different non-contractible loops, along the same direction on a
torus, result in different ground states. This is an exponential increase in
the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this code. Moreover the
face excitations in this system are deconfined, free to move without an energy
cost along certain directions of the lattice, whereas in certain other
directions their movement incurs an energy cost. This places a restriction on
the types of loop operators that contribute to the ground state degeneracy. The
vertex excitations are immobile. The results are also extended to the groupoid
analogs of Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric codes.

synthesizing feedback controllers (agents) for various complex systems with
unknown dynamics. These systems are expected to satisfy diverse safety and
liveness properties best captured using temporal logic. In RL, the reward
function plays a crucial role in specifying the desired behaviour of these
agents. However, the problem of designing the reward function for an RL agent
to satisfy complex temporal logic specifications has received limited attention
in the literature. To address this, we provide a systematic way of generating
rewards in real-time by using the quantitative semantics of Signal Temporal
Logic (STL), a widely used temporal logic to specify the behaviour of
cyber-physical systems. We propose a new quantitative semantics for STL having
several desirable properties, making it suitable for reward generation. We
evaluate our STL-based reinforcement learning mechanism on several complex
continuous control benchmarks and compare our STL semantics with those
available in the literature in terms of their efficacy in synthesizing the
controller agent. Experimental results establish our new semantics to be the
most suitable for synthesizing feedback controllers for complex continuous
dynamical systems through reinforcement learning.

study the dynamics and growth of initially sub-$\mu m$ dust particles in
self-gravitating young protoplanetary disks with various strengths of turbulent
viscosity. We aim to understand the physical conditions that determine the
formation and spatial distribution of pebbles when both disk self-gravity and
turbulent viscosity can be concurrently at work. Methods. We perform the
thin-disk hydrodynamics simulations of self-gravitating protoplanetary disks
over an initial time period of 0.5 Myr using the FEOSAD code. Turbulent
viscosity is parameterized in terms of the spatially and temporally constant
$\alpha$-parameter, while the effects of gravitational instability on dust
growth is accounted for by calculating the effective parameter $\alpha_{\rm
GI}$. We consider the evolution of dust component including momentum exchange
with gas, dust self-gravity, and also a simplified model of dust growth.
Results. We find that the level of turbulent viscosity strongly affects the
spatial distribution and total mass of pebbles in the disk. The
$\alpha=10^{-2}$ model is viscosity-dominated, pebbles are completely absent,
and dust-to-gas mass ratio deviates from the reference 1:100 value no more than
by 30\% throughout the disk extent. On the contrary, the $\alpha=10^{-3}$ model
and, especially, the $\alpha=10^{-4}$ model are dominated by gravitational
instability. The effective parameter $\alpha+\alpha_{\rm GI}$ is now a strongly
varying function of radial distance. As a consequence, a bottle neck effect
develops in the innermost disk regions, which makes gas and dust accumulate in
a ring-like structure. Abridged.

input is a set of items of sizes in $(0,1]$, and a partition matroid over the

such that each bin forms an independent set in the matroid. The problem is a
generalization of both Group Bin Packing and Bin Packing with Cardinality
Constraints. Bin Packing with Partition Matroid naturally arises in resource
allocation to ensure fault tolerance and security, as well as in harvesting
computing capacity. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that packs
the items in $OPT + o(OPT)$ bins, where OPT is the minimum number of bins
required for packing the given instance. This matches the best known result for
the classic Bin Packing problem up to the function hidden by o(OPT). As special
cases, our result improves upon the existing APTAS for Group Bin Packing and
generalizes the AFTPAS for Bin Packing with Cardinality Constraints. Our
approach is based on rounding a solution for a configuration-LP formulation of
the problem. The rounding takes a novel point of view of prototypes in which
items are interpreted as placeholders for other items and applies fractional
grouping to modify a fractional solution (prototype) into one having nice

present a novel spectral feature argumentation for contrastive learning on

approximation per feature map and subtract that approximation from the map to
obtain its complement. This is achieved by the proposed herein incomplete power
iteration, a non-standard power iteration regime which enjoys two valuable
byproducts (under mere one or two iterations): (i) it partially balances
spectrum of the feature map, and (ii) it injects the noise into rebalanced
singular values of the feature map (spectral augmentation). For two views, we
align these rebalanced feature maps as such an improved alignment step can
focus more on less dominant singular values of matrices of both views, whereas
the spectral augmentation does not affect the spectral angle alignment
(singular vectors are not perturbed). We derive the analytical form for: (i)
the incomplete power iteration to capture its spectrum-balancing effect, and
(ii) the variance of singular values augmented implicitly by the noise. We also
show that the spectral augmentation improves the generalization bound.
Experiments on graph/image datasets show that our spectral feature augmentation
outperforms baselines, and is complementary with other augmentation strategies

incorrect words in sentences generated by ASR models. Since recent ASR models
usually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct
tokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and
therefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous
works on error correction either implicitly detect error words through
target-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or
explicitly locate specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors. However,
implicit error detection does not provide clear signal about which tokens are
incorrect and explicit error detection suffers from low detection accuracy. In
this paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to
avoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection.
Specifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a
probability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design
a constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to
let the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit
error detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which
words are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only
incorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not
detect specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors but just leaves it to
CTC loss. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and Aidatatang datasets show that
SoftCorrect achieves 26.1% and 9.4% CER reduction respectively, outperforming
previous works by a large margin, while still enjoying fast speed of parallel
generation.

vectors: from the general framework of multivariate regular variation and the
flexible class of max-stable vectors down to simple and concise summary
measures like the matrix of bivariate tail-dependence coefficients. This paper
starts by providing a review of existing results from a unifying perspective,
which highlights connections between extreme value theory and the theory of
cuts and metrics. Our approach leads to some new findings in both areas with
some applications to current topics in risk management.
  We begin by using the framework of multivariate regular variation to show
that extremal coefficients, or equivalently, the higher-order tail-dependence
coefficients of a random vector can simply be understood in terms of random
exceedance sets, which allows us to extend the notion of Bernoulli
compatibility. In the special but important case of bi-variate tail-dependence,
we establish a correspondence between tail-dependence matrices and $L^1$- and
$\ell_1$-embeddable finite metric spaces via the spectral distance, which is a
metric on the space of jointly $1$-Fr\'{e}chet random variables. Namely, the
coefficients of the cut-decomposition of the spectral distance and of the
Tawn-Molchanov max-stable model realizing the corresponding bi-variate extremal
dependence coincide. We show that line metrics are rigid and if the spectral
distance corresponds to a line metric, the higher order tail-dependence is
determined by the bi-variate tail-dependence matrix.
  Finally, the correspondence between $\ell_1$-embeddable metric spaces and
tail-dependence matrices allows us to revisit the realizability problem, i.e.
checking whether a given matrix is a valid tail-dependence matrix. We confirm a
conjecture of Shyamalkumar & Tao (2020) that this problem is NP-complete.

the embedding as well. While Autoencoders (AE) are widely used in practice for
unsupervised representation learning, they do not fulfil the above condition on
the embedding as they obtain a single representation of the data. To overcome
this we propose a meta-algorithm that can be used to extend an arbitrary AE
architecture to a tensorized version (TAE) that allows for learning
cluster-specific embeddings while simultaneously learning the cluster
assignment. For the linear setting we prove that TAE can recover the principle
components of the different clusters in contrast to principle component of the
entire data recovered by a standard AE. We validated this on planted models and
for general, non-linear and convolutional AEs we empirically illustrate that
tensorizing the AE is beneficial in clustering and de-noising tasks.

jointly, significant reduction in terms of energy footprints can be obtained.
This article provides a first look into the energy costs of MTL processes
driven by the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) paradigm and implemented in
distributed wireless networks. The paper targets a clustered multi-task network
setup where autonomous agents learn different but related tasks. The MTL
process is carried out in two stages: the optimization of a meta-model that can
be quickly adapted to learn new tasks, and a task-specific model adaptation
stage where the learned meta-model is transferred to agents and tailored for a
specific task. This work analyzes the main factors that influence the MTL
energy balance by considering a multi-task Reinforcement Learning (RL) setup in
a robotized environment. Results show that the MAML method can reduce the
energy bill by at least 2 times compared with traditional approaches without
inductive transfer. Moreover, it is shown that the optimal energy balance in
wireless networks depends on uplink/downlink and sidelink communication
efficiencies.

fracture, investigated by Bhattacharya and Viesca (2019); Viesca (2021) and
whose results are here extended to include closed form solutions for aseismic
moment as function of injected volume Vinj. Notably, we demonstrate that the
hydro-mechanical response of the fractured rock mass is at first order governed
by a single dimensionless parameter T associated with favourably oriented
fractures: low values of T (critically stressed conditions) lead to fast
migration of aseismic slip from injection point due to elastic stress transfer
on critically stressed fractures. In this case, therefore, there is no effect
of the DFN percolation number on the spatio-temporal evolution of aseismic
slip. On the other hand, in marginally pressurized conditions (T > 1), the
slipping patch lags behind the pressurized region and hence the percolation
number affects to a first order the response of the medium. Furthermore, we
show that the aseismic moment scales Vinj^2 in both limiting conditions,
similarly to the case of a single planar fracture subjected to the same
injection condition. The factor of proportionality, however, depends on the DFN
characteristics in marginally pressurized conditions, while it appears to be
only mildly dependent on the DFN properties in critically stressed conditions.

Whereas, the model exhibits two different values of the topological invariant
in the two different insulating phases (structurally differentiated by

distinct topological phases with the closure of the gap is practically
unachievable due requirement of high amount of transverse strain. We also show

  Salience-Aware Graph Learning","Accepted by AAAI2023",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The opaqueness of the multi-hop fact verification model imposes imperative
requirements for explainability. One feasible way is to extract rationales, a
subset of inputs, where the performance of prediction drops dramatically when
being removed. Though being explainable, most rationale extraction methods for
multi-hop fact verification explore the semantic information within each piece
of evidence individually, while ignoring the topological information
interaction among different pieces of evidence. Intuitively, a faithful
rationale bears complementary information being able to extract other
rationales through the multi-hop reasoning process. To tackle such
disadvantages, we cast explainable multi-hop fact verification as subgraph
extraction, which can be solved based on graph convolutional network (GCN) with
salience-aware graph learning. In specific, GCN is utilized to incorporate the
topological interaction information among multiple pieces of evidence for
learning evidence representation. Meanwhile, to alleviate the influence of
noisy evidence, the salience-aware graph perturbation is induced into the
message passing of GCN. Moreover, the multi-task model with three diagnostic
properties of rationale is elaborately designed to improve the quality of an
explanation without any explicit annotations. Experimental results on the
FEVEROUS benchmark show significant gains over previous state-of-the-art
methods for both rationale extraction and fact verification.

everyday life and economics around the world. An important complication that
can arise in connection with a COVID-19 infection is acute kidney injury. A
recent observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients treated at multiple
sites of a tertiary care center in Berlin, Germany identified risk factors for
the development of (severe) acute kidney injury. Since inferring results from a
single study can be tricky, we validate these findings and potentially adjust
results by including external information from other studies on acute kidney
injury and COVID-19.
  Methods: We synthesize the results of the main study with other trials via a
Bayesian meta-analysis. The external information is used to construct a
predictive distribution and to derive posterior estimates for the study of
interest. We focus on various important potential risk factors for acute kidney
injury development such as mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors,
hypertension, obesity, diabetes, gender and smoking.
  Results: Our results show that depending on the degree of heterogeneity in
the data the estimated effect sizes may be refined considerably with inclusion
of external data. Our findings confirm that mechanical ventilation and use of
vasopressors are important risk factors for the development of acute kidney
injury in COVID-19 patients. Hypertension also appears to be a risk factor that
should not be ignored. Shrinkage weights depended to a large extent on the
estimated heterogeneity in the model.
  Conclusions: Our work shows how external information can be used to adjust
the results from a primary study, using a Bayesian meta-analytic approach. How
much information is borrowed from external studies will depend on the degree of
heterogeneity present in the model.

errors originating from the non-linear scaling of the qubit drive rate with the

the rotation angles deviate by up to several degrees from a linear model. Using
purity benchmarking, we find that control errors reach $2\times 10^{-4}$, which

demonstrate arbitrary-angle single-qubit gates with coherence-limited errors of

networked structures (simplicial complexes) is one of the challenging problem
due to the presence of time-varying group interactions. In this context, most
of the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or
on static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general
framework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial
complexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution
and obtain the necessary condition for it to be emerged as a stable state in
fast switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays
the role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial
topologies are adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem
into a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general
circumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is
cumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this
difficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms
of the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial
complex, and demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a
master stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by
applying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems. In addition, our
results also reveal that with sufficient higher-order coupling and adequately
fast rewiring, the temporal simplicial complex achieves synchrony even in a
very low connectivity regime.

focal adhesion. Focusing on this particular phenomenon and based on previous
works, we derive a novel two-dimensional mechanical model, which relies on the
following physical ingredients: the asymmetrical renewal of the actin cortex
supporting the membrane, resulting in a backward flow of material; the
mechanical description of the nucleus membrane and the inner nuclear material;
the microtubule network guiding nucleus location; the contact interactions
between the cell and the external environment. The resulting fourth order
system of partial differential equations is then solved numerically to conduct
a study of the qualitative effects of the model parameters, mainly those
governing the mechanical properties of the nucleus and the geometry of the
confining structure. Coherently with biological observations, we find that
cells characterized by a stiff nucleus are unable to migrate in channels that
can be crossed by cells with a softer nucleus. Regarding the geometry, cell
velocity and ability to migrate are influenced by the width of the channel and
the wavelength of the external structure. Even though still preliminary, these
results can be potentially useful in determining the physical limit of cell
migration in confined environment and in designing scaffold for tissue
engineering.

there do not exist $s$ cycles of the graph that are pairwise vertex-disjoint
and have no edges joining them. The structure of such graphs, even when $s=2$,
is not well understood. For instance, until now we did not know how to test
whether a graph is $2\mathcal{O}$-free in polynomial time; and there was an
open conjecture, due to Ngoc Khang Le, that $2\mathcal{O}$-free graphs have
only a polynomial number of induced paths.
  In this paper we prove Le's conjecture; indeed, we will show that for all
$s\ge 1$, there exists $c>0$ such that every $s\mathcal{O}$-free graph $G$ has
at most $|G|^c$ induced paths. This provides a poly-time algorithm to test if a
graph is $s\mathcal{O}$-free, for all fixed $s$.
  The proof has three parts. First, there is a short and beautiful proof, due

of uniaxial strain on LaMnO$_3$ employing ab-initio dynamical mean-field
theory. Projecting on the low-energy subspace of Mn $3d$ states, and solving
multi-impurity problems, our approach emphasizes on local correlations at Mn
sites. At ambient pressures, LaMnO$_3$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit
cell, with in-plane lattice constants $a<b$. If we apply uniaxial compressive
strain such that the in-plane lattice becomes square with lattice constant $a$,
we find a ferromagnetic insulating state. This is in contrast to DFT results
using various functionals like PBE, PBE+$U$, and hybrid functionals like HSE,
which all predict a half-metallic ferromagnetic behaviour in this case, due to
the static treatment of correlations. Interestingly, applying uniaxial tensile
strain, such that the in-plane lattice becomes square with the longer lattice
constant $b$, an antiferromagnetic insulating state is observed, similar to the
case of unstrained LMO. We trace back these result to the reduction in
Jahn-Teller distortion in the case of compressive strain, favoring a
ferromagnetic state. This reduction is absent in the tensile case, and the
antiferromagnetic state therefore survives.

detecting anomalous nodes in an unlabelled target graph using auxiliary,
related source graphs with labelled anomalous and normal nodes. Although it
presents a promising approach to address the notoriously high false positive
issue in anomaly detection, little work has been done in this line of research.
There are numerous domain adaptation methods in the literature, but it is
difficult to adapt them for GAD due to the unknown distributions of the
anomalies and the complex node relations embedded in graph data. To this end,
we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach, namely Anomaly-aware
Contrastive alignmenT (ACT), for GAD. ACT is designed to jointly optimise: (i)
unsupervised contrastive learning of normal representations of nodes in the
target graph, and (ii) anomaly-aware one-class alignment that aligns these
contrastive node representations and the representations of labelled normal
nodes in the source graph, while enforcing significant deviation of the
representations of the normal nodes from the labelled anomalous nodes in the
source graph. In doing so, ACT effectively transfers anomaly-informed knowledge
from the source graph to learn the complex node relations of the normal class
for GAD on the target graph without any specification of the anomaly
distributions. Extensive experiments on eight CD-GAD settings demonstrate that
our approach ACT achieves substantially improved detection performance over 10
state-of-the-art GAD methods. Code is available at

future system trajectories using a persistently exciting input-output

employing a generalized terminal constraint with artificial equilibrium, the

more and more important for the future large-scale photonic integration as
desired for many systems. Although some compact silicon photonic devices have
been demonstrated by using inverse design, the device performance is still
insufficient for real applications. Here, we propose and realize several
representative ultra-compact advanced passive silicon photonic devices with
decent performances by introducing subwavelength-grating (SWG) structures
developed by our high-efficiency inverse design method. These devices are
designed by optimally manipulating the multimode excitation and the multimode
interference in a region defined with SWG structures. These SWG structures with
excellent feature-size uniformity are more fabrication-friendly than those
random nano-structures used in previous inverse-designed photonic devices. The
high-efficiency of our inverse design method is attributed to a novel
search-space-dimension control strategy and the efficient problem-oriented
electromagnetic-field solvers available for SWG structures. Specifically, we
present the realization of a 6-channel mode (de)multiplexer, a broadband
90{\deg}-hybrid, and a two-channel flat-top wavelength demultiplexer as some
examples, which can hardly be realized by previously reported inverse design
approaches. These devices exhibit ultra-compact footprints as well as decent
performances when compared to the counterparts developed by the classical
theory.

Here, we make the first attempt to achieve generic text-guided cross-category
3D object generation via a new 3D-TOGO model, which integrates a text-to-views
generation module and a views-to-3D generation module. The text-to-views
generation module is designed to generate different views of the target 3D

contrastive learning are proposed for achieving better view-consistency and
caption similarity. Meanwhile, a pixelNeRF model is adopted for the views-to-3D

previously-generated views. Our 3D-TOGO model generates 3D objects in the form
of the neural radiance field with good texture and requires no time-cost
optimization for every single caption. Besides, 3D-TOGO can control the
category, color and shape of generated 3D objects with the input caption.
Extensive experiments on the largest 3D object dataset (i.e., ABO) are

followed by a short-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A, and by a non-thermal
afterglow emission. In this work, a combined simultaneous fit of the
electromagnetic (EM, specifically, afterglow) and GW domains is implemented,
both using the posterior distribution of a GW standalone analysis as prior
distribution to separately process the EM data, and fitting the EM and GW
domains simultaneously. These approaches coincide mathematically, as long as
the actual posterior of the GW analysis, and not an approximation, is used as
prior for the EM analysis. We treat the viewing angle, $\theta_v$, as shared
parameter across the two domains. In the afterglow modelling with a Gaussian
structured jet this parameter and the jet core angle, $\theta_c$, are
correlated, leading to high uncertainties on their values. The joint EM+GW
analysis relaxes this degeneracy, reducing the uncertainty compared to an
EM-only fit. We also apply our methodology to hypothetical GW170817-like events
occurring in the next GW observing run at $\sim$140 and 70 Mpc. At 70 Mpc the
existing EM degeneracy is broken, thanks to the inclusion of the GW domain in
the analysis. At 140 Mpc, the EM-only fit cannot constrain $\theta_v$ nor
$\theta_c$ because of the lack of detections in the afterglow rising phase.
Folding the GW data into the analysis leads to tighter constraints on
$\theta_v$, still leaving $\theta_c$ unconstrained, requiring instruments with
higher sensitivities, such as Athena.

experimentally studied in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well using a time-resolved
reflectance spectroscopy of nonradiative broadening of exciton resonances. The
population of the reservoir is controlled either by the excitation power or by
the temperature of the structure under study. The dynamics is quantitatively
analyzed in the framework of the model developed earlier [Kurdyubov et al.,

processes, such as scattering of photoexcited excitons into the reservoir,
dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers and the reverse process,
carrier-induced exciton scattering into the light cone depleting the reservoir,
thermally activated nonradiative losses of charge carriers. We have found that
competition of these processes leads to highly nonlinear dynamics of reservoir
excitons, although their density is far below the exciton Mott transition
densities. Characteristic rates of the processes and their dependencies on the

methods often require a large number of paired multi-modal data to train an
effective synthesis model. However, it is often challenging to obtain
sufficient paired data for supervised training. In reality, we often have a
small number of paired data while a large number of unpaired data. To take
advantage of both paired and unpaired data, in this paper, we propose a
Multi-scale Transformer Network (MT-Net) with edge-aware pre-training for
cross-modality MR image synthesis. Specifically, an Edge-preserving Masked
AutoEncoder (Edge-MAE) is first pre-trained in a self-supervised manner to
simultaneously perform 1) image imputation for randomly masked patches in each
image and 2) whole edge map estimation, which effectively learns both
contextual and structural information. Besides, a novel patch-wise loss is
proposed to enhance the performance of Edge-MAE by treating different masked
patches differently according to the difficulties of their respective
imputations. Based on this proposed pre-training, in the subsequent fine-tuning
stage, a Dual-scale Selective Fusion (DSF) module is designed (in our MT-Net)
to synthesize missing-modality images by integrating multi-scale features
extracted from the encoder of the pre-trained Edge-MAE. Further, this
pre-trained encoder is also employed to extract high-level features from the
synthesized image and corresponding ground-truth image, which are required to
be similar (consistent) in the training. Experimental results show that our
MT-Net achieves comparable performance to the competing methods even using
$70\%$ of all available paired data. Our code will be publicly available at

  AR/VR Rendering","Accepted to ICCAD 2022",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based rendering has attracted growing attention
thanks to its state-of-the-art (SOTA) rendering quality and wide applications
in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). However, immersive real-time (> 30
FPS) NeRF based rendering enabled interactions are still limited due to the low
achievable throughput on AR/VR devices. To this end, we first profile SOTA
efficient NeRF algorithms on commercial devices and identify two primary causes
of the aforementioned inefficiency: (1) the uniform point sampling and (2) the
dense accesses and computations of the required embeddings in NeRF.
Furthermore, we propose RT-NeRF, which to the best of our knowledge is the
first algorithm-hardware co-design acceleration of NeRF. Specifically, on the
algorithm level, RT-NeRF integrates an efficient rendering pipeline for largely
alleviating the inefficiency due to the commonly adopted uniform point sampling
method in NeRF by directly computing the geometry of pre-existing points.
Additionally, RT-NeRF leverages a coarse-grained view-dependent computing
ordering scheme for eliminating the (unnecessary) processing of invisible
points. On the hardware level, our proposed RT-NeRF accelerator (1) adopts a
hybrid encoding scheme to adaptively switch between a bitmap- or
coordinate-based sparsity encoding format for NeRF's sparse embeddings, aiming
to maximize the storage savings and thus reduce the required DRAM accesses
while supporting efficient NeRF decoding; and (2) integrates both a
dual-purpose bi-direction adder & search tree and a high-density sparse search
unit to coordinate the two aforementioned encoding formats. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets consistently validate the effectiveness of
RT-NeRF, achieving a large throughput improvement (e.g., 9.7x - 3,201x) while
maintaining the rendering quality as compared with SOTA efficient NeRF
solutions.

for lossless coding of screen content. One such state-of-the-art method is
known as soft context formation (SCF). For each pixel to be encoded, a
probability distribution is estimated based on the neighboring pattern and the
occurrence of that pattern in the already encoded image. Using an arithmetic
coder, the pixel color can thus be encoded very efficiently, provided that the
current color has been observed before in association with a similar pattern.
If this is not the case, the color is instead encoded using a color palette or,
if it is still unknown, via residual coding. Both palette-based coding and
residual coding have significantly worse compression efficiency than coding
based on soft context formation. In this paper, the residual coding stage is
improved by adaptively trimming the probability distributions for the residual
error. Furthermore, an enhanced probability modeling for indicating a new color
depending on the occurrence of new colors in the neighborhood is proposed.
These modifications result in a bitrate reduction of up to 2.9% on average.
Compared to HEVC (HM-16.21 + SCM-8.8) and FLIF, the improved SCF method saves
on average about 11% and 18% rate, respectively.

these solutions. The experimental results on several MOO machine learning tasks

there remain two crucial challenges. First, the feature learning for novel
classes is suppressed during the training on base classes in that the novel

underlying semantic gap between the support and the query resulting from the
representative bias by the scarce support samples. To circumvent these two
challenges, we propose to activate the discriminability of novel classes
explicitly in both the feature encoding stage and the prediction stage for

mix with ordinary photons. The mass range from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ eV of

the use of coherent millimeter waves to search for dark photons in a

critical for downstream tasks such as classification and forecasting.
Contrastive learning has recently shown its promising representation learning
capability in the absence of expert annotations. However, existing contrastive
approaches generally treat each instance independently, which leads to false
negative pairs that share the same semantics. To tackle this problem, we
propose MHCCL, a Masked Hierarchical Cluster-wise Contrastive Learning model,
which exploits semantic information obtained from the hierarchical structure
consisting of multiple latent partitions for multivariate time series.
Motivated by the observation that fine-grained clustering preserves higher
purity while coarse-grained one reflects higher-level semantics, we propose a
novel downward masking strategy to filter out fake negatives and supplement
positives by incorporating the multi-granularity information from the
clustering hierarchy. In addition, a novel upward masking strategy is designed
in MHCCL to remove outliers of clusters at each partition to refine prototypes,
which helps speed up the hierarchical clustering process and improves the
clustering quality. We conduct experimental evaluations on seven widely-used
multivariate time series datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of
MHCCL over the state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised time series
representation learning.

latent variables have difficulty capturing more diverse expressions. To tackle
these problems, we combine the merits of both continuous and discrete latent

constrains the global semantics of responses through discrete latent variables
and enriches responses with continuous latent variables. Thus, we diversify the
generated responses while maintaining relevance and coherence. In addition, we
propose Conditional Hybrid Variational Transformer (CHVT) to construct and to
utilize HLV with transformers for dialogue generation. Through fine-grained
symbolic-level semantic information and additive Gaussian mixing, we construct
the distribution of continuous variables, prompting the generation of diverse
expressions. Meanwhile, to maintain the relevance and coherence, the discrete
latent variable is optimized by self-separation training. Experimental results
on two dialogue generation datasets (DailyDialog and Opensubtitles) show that
CHVT is superior to traditional transformer-based variational mechanism w.r.t.
diversity, relevance and coherence metrics. Moreover, we also demonstrate the
benefit of applying HLV to fine-tuning two pre-trained dialogue models (PLATO

the number of equal-letter runs $r$, arguably the most important parameter of
BWT-based data structures, such as the FM-index or the $r$-index. Bentley,
Gibney, and Thankachan [ESA 2020] introduced a linear-time algorithm for
computing the permutation of the input collection which yields the minimum

  In this paper, we present the first tool that guarantees a

an algorithm that builds the BWT from a string collection (either SAIS-based

  We present results both on real-life and simulated data, showing that the
improvement achieved in terms of $r$ with respect to the input order is

cooperate even when at relatively large distances from each other; (ii) the

different contexts, from solitons in quantum fluids to structure formation in
the universe. The coarsening process entails anomalously slow self-similar
transport of the spectral distribution of excitations towards low energies,
induced by the collisional interactions between the field modes. The focus is
set on the non-relativistic limit exhibiting particle excitations only,

The results of our classical statistical simulations suggest that, in contrast
to wave turbulent cascades, in which the transport is local in momentum space,
the coarsening is dominated by rather non-local processes corresponding to a
spatial containment in position space. The scaling analysis of a kinetic
equation obtained with path-integral techniques corroborates this numerical
observation and suggests that the non-locality is directly related to the
slowness of the scaling in space and time. Our methods, which we expect to be

which re-sums a series of closed loop chains akin to a large-$N$ expansion at
next-to-leading order. The resulting kinetic equation is analyzed for possible
scaling solutions in space and time that are characterized by a set of
universal scaling exponents and encode self-similar transport to low momenta.
Assuming the momentum occupancy distribution to exhibit a scaling form we can
determine the exponents by identifying the dominating contributions to the
scattering integral and power counting. If the field exhibits strong variations
across many wells of the cosine potential, the scattering integral is dominated
by the scattering of many quasiparticles such that the momentum of each single
participating mode is only weakly constrained. Remarkably, in this case, in
contrast to wave turbulent cascades, which correspond to local transport in
momentum space, our results suggest that kinetic scattering here is dominated
by rather non-local processes corresponding to a spatial containment in

in the framework of the multi-label classification (MLC) of remote sensing (RS)
images. To optimize the large number of parameters of DNNs a high number of
reliable training images annotated with multi-labels is often required.
However, the collection of a large training set is time-consuming, complex and
costly. To minimize annotation efforts for data-demanding DNNs, in this paper
we present several query functions for active learning (AL) in the context of
DNNs for the MLC of RS images. Unlike the AL query functions defined for
single-label classification or semantic segmentation problems, each query
function presented in this paper is based on the evaluation of two criteria: i)
multi-label uncertainty; and ii) multi-label diversity. The multi-label
uncertainty criterion is associated to the confidence of the DNNs in correctly
assigning multi-labels to each image. To assess the multi-label uncertainty, we
present and adapt to the MLC problems three strategies: i) learning multi-label
loss ordering; ii) measuring temporal discrepancy of multi-label prediction;
and iii) measuring magnitude of approximated gradient embedding. The
multi-label diversity criterion aims at selecting a set of uncertain images
that are as diverse as possible to reduce the redundancy among them. To assess
this criterion we exploit a clustering based strategy. We combine each of the
above-mentioned uncertainty strategy with the clustering based diversity
strategy, resulting in three different query functions. Experimental results
obtained on two benchmark archives show that our query functions result in the
selection of a highly informative set of samples at each iteration of the AL
process in the context of MLC.

$\beta_{\rm osc}$ characterising the scale of the interfacial height $\ell_0
\propto R_w^{\beta_{\rm osc}}$ at osculation, for large $R_w$, falls into two
regimes representing fluctuation-dominated and mean-field like behaviour,
respectively. These two regimes are separated by an upper critical dimension,
which is determined here explicitly and which depends on the range of the
intermolecular forces. In the fluctuation-dominated regime, representing the
universality class of systems with short-ranged forces, the exponent is related
to the value of the interfacial wandering exponent $\zeta$ by $\beta_{\rm
osc}=3\zeta/(4-\zeta)$. In contrast, in the mean-field regime, which has not
been previously identified, and which occurs for systems with longer ranged
forces (and higher dimensions), the exponent $\beta_{\rm osc}$ takes the same
value as the exponent $\beta_s^{\rm co}$ for complete wetting which is
determined directly by the intermolecular forces. The prediction $\beta_{\rm
osc}=3/7$ in $d=2$ for systems with short-ranged forces (corresponding to
$\zeta=1/2$) is confirmed using an interfacial Hamiltonian model which
determines the exact scaling form for the decay of the interfacial height
probability distribution function. A numerical study in $d=3$, based on a
microscopic model Density Functional Theory, determines that $\beta_{\rm osc}

such as obtained from ultra wide-angle fisheye cameras, however, block matching
meets its limits. In this paper, an adapted disparity estimation approach for
fisheye images is introduced. The proposed method exploits knowledge about the
fisheye projection function to transform the fisheye coordinate grid to a
corresponding perspective mesh. Offsets between views can thus be determined
more accurately, resulting in more reliable disparity maps. By re-projecting
the perspective mesh to the fisheye domain, the original fisheye field of view

extension of the classical high-dimensional regression model. It turns out
that, in this framework, our upper bound on the minimax separation rate matches

underlying networks have special topologies, called weak reversibility (WR) and
zero deficiency (ZD), and the kinetic law follows a generalized form of

without being overheard by Eve who is eavesdropping over a degraded channel.
Systems for achieving that physical layer security often rely on an error
correction code whose rate is below the Shannon capacity of Alice and Bob's
channel, so Bob can reliably decode, but above Alice and Eve's, so Eve cannot
reliably decode. For the finite block length regime, several metrics have been
proposed to characterise information leakage. Here we assess a new metric, the
success exponent, and demonstrate it can be operationalized through the use of
Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) to compromise the
physical-layer security of any moderate length code.
  Success exponents are the natural beyond-capacity analogue of error exponents
that characterise the probability that a maximum likelihood decoding is correct
when the code-rate is above Shannon capacity, which is exponentially decaying
in the code-length. Success exponents can be used to approximately evaluate the
frequency with which Eve's decoding is correct in beyond-capacity channel
conditions. Through the use of GRAND, we demonstrate that Eve can constrain her
decoding procedure so that when she does identify a decoding, it is correct
with high likelihood, significantly compromising Alice and Bob's communication
by truthfully revealing a proportion of it.
  We provide general mathematical expressions for the determination of success
exponents as well as for the evaluation of Eve's query number threshold, using
the binary symmetric channel as a worked example. As GRAND algorithms are
code-book agnostic and can decode any code structure, we provide empirical
results for Random Linear Codes as exemplars. Simulation results demonstrate
the practical possibility of compromising physical layer security.

CvxCSV which is a parameter-reduced modification of the recent Constant

convex combination of its initial and final values. We derive a lower bound on
the achievable mean interference-to-signal ratio (ISR) based on the
Cram\'er-Rao theory. The bound reveals advantageous properties of CvxCSV
compared with CSV and compared with a sequential BSE based on independent
component extraction (ICE). In particular, the achievable ISR by CvxCSV is
lower than that by the previous approaches. Moreover, the model requires
significantly weaker conditions for identifiability, even when the SOI is
Gaussian.

simultaneously with the onset of superconductivity (B\""ohmer et al., Nat. Comm.
6, 7911 (2015)). Here, by applying magnetic fields up to 10T, we investigate in
more detail the interplay of superconductivity with this magneto-structural
transition using a combination of high-resolution thermal-expansion and
heat-capacity measurements. We find that a magnetic field suppresses the
reentrance of the single-Q orthorhombic phase more strongly than the
superconducting transition, resulting in a splitting of the zero-field
first-order transition. The suppression rate of the orthorhombic reentrance
transition is stronger for out-of-plane than for in-plane fields and scales
with the anisotropy of the superconducting state. These effects are captured
within a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau model, strongly suggesting that the
suppression of the reentrant orthorhombic single-Q phase is primarily linked to
the field-induced weakening of the superconducting order. Not captured by this
model is however a strong reduction of the orthorhombic distortion for
out-of-plane fields, which deserves further theoretical attention.

to use neural architectures alongside self-supervised objectives which
encourage better representation learning. In practice, there are few guarantees
that these self-supervised objectives encode task-relevant information. We
propose the Scene Graph Contrastive (SGC) loss, which uses scene graphs as
general-purpose, training-only, supervisory signals. The SGC loss does away
with explicit graph decoding and instead uses contrastive learning to align an
agent's representation with a rich graphical encoding of its environment. The
SGC loss is generally applicable, simple to implement, and encourages
representations that encode objects' semantics, relationships, and history.
Using the SGC loss, we attain significant gains on three embodied tasks: Object

accessing information about where victims are located in the county could
compromise their safety, so it is not possible to develop interventions for

the risk of human rights abuses without collecting data that could compromise
victim safety. Current methods require studies to have a large number of

flexible spatial modelling structure and a mechanism to schedule comparisons
more effectively. The methods reduce the data collection burden on participants
and make a comparative judgement study feasible with a small number of

field samples is non-trivial. We address this challenge by pairing the
denoising formulation with a rendering loss, enabling our model to learn a
deviated prior that favours good image quality instead of trying to replicate
fitting errors like floating artifacts. In contrast to 2D-diffusion models, our
model learns multi-view consistent priors, enabling free-view synthesis and
accurate shape generation. Compared to 3D GANs, our diffusion-based approach
naturally enables conditional generation such as masked completion or

highly localized densification zones consisting of strongly aligned fibers

SAGIN faces the challenges of highly constrained network topology, inefficient
data transmission, and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, we first
propose a novel topology-aware federated learning framework for the SAGIN,
namely Olive Branch Learning (OBL). Specifically, the IoRT devices in the
ground layer leverage their private data to perform model training locally,
while the air nodes in the air layer and the ring-structured low earth orbit

aggregation (synchronization) at different scales.To further enhance
communication efficiency and inference performance of OBL, an efficient
Communication and Non-IID-aware Air node-Satellite Assignment (CNASA) algorithm
is designed by taking the data class distribution of the air nodes as well as
their geographic locations into account. Furthermore, we extend our OBL
framework and CNASA algorithm to adapt to more complex multi-orbit satellite
networks. We analyze the convergence of our OBL framework and conclude that the
CNASA algorithm contributes to the fast convergence of the global model.
Extensive experiments based on realistic datasets corroborate the superior
performance of our algorithm over the benchmark policies.

transfer. The convergence archive assists the CoMMEA to quickly approaching the
Pareto optimal front (PF). The knowledge of the converged solutions is then
transferred to the diversity archive which utilizes the local convergence

HIS development process. The model was developed based on the systematic
literature review (SLR) approach and Empirical results. The 53 primary studies
were extracted using the SLR approach and CSFs, CBs, and best practices were
identified form the extracted primary studies. The identified success factors
and barriers were further ranked using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
approach. Furthermore, I have adopted the critical success factors (CSFs) and
critical barriers (CBs) instead of PAs and available Maturity models i.e., CMMI
for the development of (SRE-HIMM). The identified CSFs and CBs were classified
into five maturity levels based on the CMMI, IMM, and SOVRM. The empirical
investigation was conducted HIS experts to evaluate the findings of SLR.
Further, a case study was conducted with the company to evaluate the
effectiveness of SRE-HIMM which shows satisfactory results.

  Blockchain","12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market in the Ethereum blockchain experienced
explosive growth in 2021, with a monthly trade volume reaching \$6 billion in
January 2022. However, concerns have emerged about possible wash trading, a
form of market manipulation in which one party repeatedly trades an NFT to
inflate its volume artificially. Our research examines the effects of wash
trading on the NFT market in Ethereum from the beginning until January 2022,
using multiple approaches. We find that wash trading affects 5.66% of all NFT
collections, with a total artificial volume of \$3,406,110,774. We look at two
ways to profit from wash trading: Artificially increasing the price of the NFT
and taking advantage of the token reward systems provided by some marketplaces.
Our findings show that exploiting the token reward systems of NFTMs is much
more profitable (mean gain of successful operations is \$1.055M on LooksRare),
more likely to succeed (more than 80% of operations), and less risky than
reselling an NFT at a higher price using wash trading (50% of activities result
in a loss). Our research highlights that wash trading is frequent in Ethereum
and that NFTMs should implement protective mechanisms to stop such illicit
behavior.

for autonomous driving systems. Recently, plenty of works are proposed,
following a similar paradigm consisting of three essential components, i.e.,
camera feature extraction, BEV feature construction, and task heads. Among the
three components, BEV feature construction is BEV-specific compared with 2D
tasks. Existing methods aggregate the multi-view camera features to the
flattened grid in order to construct the BEV feature. However, flattening the
BEV space along the height dimension fails to emphasize the informative
features of different heights. For example, the barrier is located at a low
height while the truck is located at a high height. In this paper, we propose a
novel method named BEV Slice Attention Network (BEV-SAN) for exploiting the
intrinsic characteristics of different heights. Instead of flattening the BEV
space, we first sample along the height dimension to build the global and local
BEV slices. Then, the features of BEV slices are aggregated from the camera
features and merged by the attention mechanism. Finally, we fuse the merged
local and global BEV features by a transformer to generate the final feature
map for task heads. The purpose of local BEV slices is to emphasize informative
heights. In order to find them, we further propose a LiDAR-guided sampling
strategy to leverage the statistical distribution of LiDAR to determine the
heights of local slices. Compared with uniform sampling, LiDAR-guided sampling
can determine more informative heights. We conduct detailed experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-SAN. Code will be released.

class of loss functions and an implementation in the GPU enhanced neuronal
networks framework which exploits sparsity. The GPU acceleration allows us to
test EventProp extensively on more challenging learning benchmarks. We find
that EventProp performs well on some tasks but for others there are issues
where learning is slow or fails entirely. Here, we analyse these issues in
detail and discover that they relate to the use of the exact gradient of the
loss function, which by its nature does not provide information about loss
changes due to spike creation or spike deletion. Depending on the details of
the task and loss function, descending the exact gradient with EventProp can
lead to the deletion of important spikes and so to an inadvertent increase of
the loss and decrease of classification accuracy and hence a failure to learn.
In other situations the lack of knowledge about the benefits of creating
additional spikes can lead to a lack of gradient flow into earlier layers,
slowing down learning. We eventually present a first glimpse of a solution to
these problems in the form of `loss shaping', where we introduce a suitable
weighting function into an integral loss to increase gradient flow from the
output layer towards earlier layers.

crucial step for managing primary brain tumors because it allows a volumetric
analysis to have a longitudinal follow-up of tumor growth or shrinkage to
monitor disease progression and therapy response. In addition, it facilitates
further quantitative analysis such as radiomics. Deep learning models, in
particular CNNs, have been a methodology of choice in many applications of
medical image analysis including brain tumor segmentation. In this study, we
investigated the main design aspects of CNN models for the specific task of
MRI-based brain tumor segmentation. Two commonly used CNN architectures (i.e.
DeepMedic and U-Net) were used to evaluate the impact of the essential
parameters such as learning rate, batch size, loss function, and optimizer. The
performance of CNN models using different configurations was assessed with the
BraTS 2018 dataset to determine the most performant model. Then, the
generalization ability of the model was assessed using our in-house dataset.
For all experiments, U-Net achieved a higher DSC compared to the DeepMedic.
However, the difference was only statistically significant for whole tumor
segmentation using FLAIR sequence data and tumor core segmentation using T1w
sequence data. Adam and SGD both with the initial learning rate set to 0.001
provided the highest segmentation DSC when training the CNN model using U-Net
and DeepMedic architectures, respectively. No significant difference was
observed when using different normalization approaches. In terms of loss
functions, a weighted combination of soft Dice and cross-entropy loss with the
weighting term set to 0.5 resulted in an improved segmentation performance and
training stability for both DeepMedic and U-Net models.

data-driven prognosis (DDP) is proposed that only relies on in situ
measurements of data and estimates the failure based on the curvature
information extracted from the system. Unlike traditional applications that
require explicit expression of conservation principle, the proposed method
devices a local conservation functional in the neighborhood of each data point
which is represented as the minimization of curvature in the system. By
eliminating the need for offline training, the method can predict the onset of
instability for a variety of systems over a prediction horizon. The prediction
horizon to prognosticate the instability, alternatively, is considered as the
remaining useful life (RUL) metric. The framework is then employed to analyze
the health status of Li-ion batteries. Based on the results, it has
demonstrated that the DDP technique can accurately predict the onset of failure

reduced when carbon content surpasses stoichiometric concentrations, the films
all exhibited the same temperature dependent trends regardless of carbon

  Aims: The onset of kpc-scale ionised filaments in the halo of the metal-poor

investigate whether these filaments provide evidence for an outflow.
  Methods: We obtained new VLT/MUSE WFM and deep NRAO/VLA B-configuration 21cm
data of the galaxy. The MUSE data provide morphology, kinematics, and emission
line ratios H$\beta$/H$\alpha$ and [\ion{O}{iii}]$\lambda5007$/H$\alpha$ of the
low surface-brightness filaments, while the VLA data deliver morphology and
kinematics of the neutral gas in and around the system. Both datasets are used
in concert for comparisons between the ionised and the neutral phase.
  Results: We report the prolongation of a lacy filamentary ionised structure
up to a projected distance of 16 kpc at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} =
1.5\times10^{-18}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. The filaments exhibit
unusual low H$\alpha$/H$\beta \approx 2.4$ and low [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\alpha \sim
0.4 - 0.6$ typical of diffuse ionised gas. They are spectrally narrow ($\sim
20$ km s$^{-1}$) and exhibit no velocity sub-structure. The filaments extend
outwards of the elongated \ion{H}{I} halo. On small scales the $N_\mathrm{HI}$
peak is offset from the main star-forming sites. Morphology and kinematics of
\ion{H}{I} and \ion{H}{II} reveal how star-formation driven feedback interacts
differently with the ionised and the neutral phase.
  Conclusions: We reason that the filaments are a large scale manifestation of
star-formation driven feedback, namely limb-brightened edges of a giant outflow
cone that protrudes through the halo of this gas-rich system. A simple toy
model of such a conical-structure is found to be commensurable with the
observations.

earth's rotation, provide broad sky coverage and sustained instrumental
stability needed for 21-cm intensity mapping. Here we present the Tracking
Tapered Grided Estimator (TTGE) to quantify the power spectrum of the sky
signal estimated directly from the visibilities measured in drift scan radio
interferometric observations. The TTGE uses the data from the different PC to
estimate the power spectrum of the signal from a small angular region located
around a fixed tracking center (TC). The size of this angular region is decided
by a suitably chosen tapering window function which serves to reduce the
foreground contamination from bright sources located at large angles from the
TC. It is possible to cover the angular footprint of the drift scan
observations using multiple TC, and combine the estimated power spectra to
increase the signal to noise ratio. Here we have validated the TTGE using
simulations of $154 \, {\rm MHz}$ MWA drift scan observations. We show that the
TTGE can recover the input model angular power spectrum $C_{\ell}$ within $20
\%$ accuracy over the $\ell$ range $40 < \ell < 700$.

In this Letter we present new mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging and spectroscopic
data with an angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec (~300 pc) obtained with the Gran
Telescopio Canarias (GTC) instrument CanariCam. The N-band (8-13 micron)

of a nuclear starburst of ~300 pc in size, an age of 6 Myr, and a mass of

destroyed in the vicinity of the active nucleus despite the relatively large

problems. The most widely used methods in online learning are stochastic
first-order algorithms. Among this family of algorithms, there is a recently
developed algorithm, Recursive One-Over-T SGD (ROOT-SGD). ROOT-SGD is
advantageous in that it converges at a non-asymptotically fast rate, and its
estimator further converges to a normal distribution. However, this normal
distribution has unknown asymptotic covariance; thus cannot be directly applied
to measure the uncertainty. To fill this gap, we develop two estimators for the
asymptotic covariance of ROOT-SGD. Our covariance estimators are useful for
statistical inference in ROOT-SGD. Our first estimator adopts the idea of
plug-in. For each unknown component in the formula of the asymptotic
covariance, we substitute it with its empirical counterpart. The plug-in
estimator converges at the rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$, where $t$ is the
sample size. Despite its quick convergence, the plug-in estimator has the
limitation that it relies on the Hessian of the loss function, which might be
unavailable in some cases. Our second estimator is a Hessian-free estimator
that overcomes the aforementioned limitation. The Hessian-free estimator uses
the random-scaling technique, and we show that it is an asymptotically
consistent estimator of the true covariance.

  Representation Learning in Remote Sensing","This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The development of deep learning based image representation learning (IRL)
methods has attracted great attention in the context of remote sensing (RS)
image understanding. Most of these methods require the availability of a high
quantity and quality of annotated training images, which can be time-consuming
and costly to gather. To reduce labeling costs, publicly available thematic
maps, automatic labeling procedures or crowdsourced data can be used. However,
such approaches increase the risk of including label noise in training data. It
may result in overfitting on noisy labels when discriminative reasoning is
employed as in most of the existing methods. This leads to sub-optimal learning
procedures, and thus inaccurate characterization of RS images. In this paper,
as a first time in RS, we introduce a generative reasoning integrated label
noise robust representation learning (GRID) approach. GRID aims to model the
complementary characteristics of discriminative and generative reasoning for
IRL under noisy labels. To this end, we first integrate generative reasoning
into discriminative reasoning through a variational autoencoder. This allows
our approach to automatically detect training samples with noisy labels. Then,
through our label noise robust hybrid representation learning strategy, GRID
adjusts the whole learning procedure for IRL of these samples through
generative reasoning and that of the other samples through discriminative
reasoning. Our approach learns discriminative image representations while
preventing interference of noisy labels during training independently from the
IRL method. Thus, unlike the existing methods, GRID does not depend on the type
of annotation, label noise, neural network, loss or learning task, and thus can
be utilized for various RS image understanding problems. Experimental results
show the effectiveness of GRID compared to state-of-the-art methods.

a 3D photochemical-climate model to investigate the possible impact of the
atmospheric circulation and the coupling between the climate and the dynamics

do not bring significant changes compared to 1D models. Nevertheless, we
highlight a temperature dependence for atmospheric photochemical losses. A
cooling during the late Archean could then have favored the triggering of the
oxygenation. In addition, we show that the Huronian glaciations, which took
place during the GOE, could have introduced a fluctuation in the evolution of
the oxygen level. Finally, we show that the oxygen overshoot which is expected
to have occurred just after the GOE, was likely accompanied by a methane
overshoot. Such high methane concentrations could have had climatic

medical diagnosis, security screening and materials science. Recently, we
derived a new method to quantify the diffusive dark-field signal in terms of a
scattering angle using a single-exposure grid-based approach. In this
manuscript, we look at the problem of quantifying the sample microstructure
size from this single-exposure dark-field signal. We do this by quantifying the
diffusive dark-field signal produced by 5 different sizes of polystyrene
microspheres, ranging from 1.0 $\mu$m to 10.8 $\mu$m, to investigate how the
strength of the dark-field signal changes with the sample microstructure size,

microstructure with a specific size and thickness, and successfully verify this
equation with experimental data. Our theoretical model predicts that the
dark-field scattering angle is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{S}$, which is

with the running time test very well. Experiments show that the time
consumption is about $1\sim 10$ microseconds with different computation
platforms for the BBT iterative algorithm (BBTIA), which is stable and
efficient for realtime applications.

  Learning on (Multi-)Omics Data",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivation: The size of available omics datasets is steadily increasing with
technological advancement in recent years. While this increase in sample size
can be used to improve the performance of relevant prediction tasks in
healthcare, models that are optimized for large datasets usually operate as
black boxes. In high stakes scenarios, like healthcare, using a black-box model
poses safety and security issues. Without an explanation about molecular
factors and phenotypes that affected the prediction, healthcare providers are
left with no choice but to blindly trust the models. We propose a new type of
artificial neural network, named Convolutional Omics Kernel Network (COmic). By
combining convolutional kernel networks with pathway-induced kernels, our
method enables robust and interpretable end-to-end learning on omics datasets
ranging in size from a few hundred to several hundreds of thousands of samples.
Furthermore, COmic can be easily adapted to utilize multi-omics data.
  Results: We evaluated the performance capabilities of COmic on six different
breast cancer cohorts. Additionally, we trained COmic models on multi-omics
data using the METABRIC cohort. Our models performed either better or similar
to competitors on both tasks. We show how the use of pathway-induced Laplacian
kernels opens the black-box nature of neural networks and results in
intrinsically interpretable models that eliminate the need for post-hoc
explanation models.

to support data-driven decision-making in the context of smart cities. Both
urban managers and residents are becoming more interested in city dashboards.
Dashboards may collect, display, analyze, and provide information on regional
performance to help smart cities development have sustainability. In order to
assist decision-making processes and enhance the performance of cities, we
examine how dashboards might be used to acquire accurate and representative
information regarding urban challenges. This chapter culminates Data Analytics
on key indicators for the city's urban services and dashboards for leadership

  morpher for real-time blank shape optimisation in the hot stamping process","32 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As the complexity of modern manufacturing technologies increases, traditional
trial-and-error design, which requires iterative and expensive simulations,
becomes unreliable and time-consuming. This difficulty is especially
significant for the design of hot-stamped safety-critical components, such as
ultra-high-strength-steel (UHSS) B-pillars. To reduce design costs and ensure
manufacturability, scalar-based Artificial-Intelligence-empowered surrogate
modelling (SAISM) has been investigated and implemented, which can allow
real-time manufacturability-constrained structural design optimisation.
However, SAISM suffers from low accuracy and generalisability, and usually
requires a high volume of training samples. To solve this problem, an
image-based Artificial-intelligence-empowered surrogate modelling (IAISM)
approach is developed in this research, in combination with an
auto-decoder-based blank shape generator. The IAISM, which is based on a
Mask-Res-SE-U-Net architecture, is trained to predict the full thinning field
of the as-formed component given an arbitrary blank shape. Excellent prediction
performance of IAISM is achieved with only 256 training samples, which
indicates the small-data learning nature of engineering AI tasks using
structured data representations. The trained auto-decoder, trained
Mask-Res-SE-U-Net, and Adam optimiser are integrated to conduct blank
optimisation by modifying the latent vector. The optimiser can rapidly find
blank shapes that satisfy manufacturability criteria. As a high-accuracy and
generalisable surrogate modelling and optimisation tool, the proposed pipeline
is promising to be integrated into a full-chain digital twin to conduct
real-time, multi-objective design optimisation.

is viable for biological neural systems to adopt such optimization methods. To
this end, we demonstrate a realization of the Adam optimizer using
biologically-plausible mechanisms in synapses. The proposed learning rule has
clear biological correspondence, runs continuously in time, and achieves
performance to comparable Adam's. In addition, we present a new approach,
inspired by the predisposition property of synapses observed in neuroscience,
to circumvent the biological implausibility of the weight transport problem in
backpropagation (BP). With only local information and no separate training
phases, this method establishes and maintains weight symmetry in the forward
and backward signaling paths, and is applicable to the proposed biologically
plausible Adam learning rule. These mechanisms may shed light on the way in
which biological synaptic dynamics facilitate learning.

to inhibit wave propagation of a specific frequency range, has numerous
potential engineering applications, such as acoustic filters and vibration
isolation control. In order to describe the behavior of such materials, a novel
integral micromorphic elastic continuum is introduced, and its ability to
describe band gaps is studied in the one-dimensional setting. The nonlocal
formulation is based on a modification of two terms in the expression for
potential energy density. The corresponding dispersion equation is derived and
converted to a dimensionless format, so that the effect of individual
parameters can be described in the most efficient way. The results indicate
that both suggested nonlocal modifications play an important role. The original
local micromorphic model reproduces a band gap only in the special, somewhat
artificial case, when the stiffness coefficient associated with the gradient of
the micromorphic variable vanishes. On the other hand, the nonlocal formulation
can provide band gaps even for nonzero values of this coefficient, provided
that the penalty coefficient that enforces coupling between the micromorphic
variable and nonlocal strain is sufficiently high and the micromorphic
stiffness is sufficiently low.

most existing work valuing data does so in one of three ways: 1) analytically
through closed-form expressions on the upper bound of the value of data, 2)
calculating the expected value of data using numerical comparisons of decisions
made using simulated data to optimal decisions where the underlying data
distribution is known, or 3) using variance reduction as proxy for the
uncertainty reduction that accompanies more data. For the very flexible case of
modelling integer-valued observations using a multinomial data-generating

generalize existing beta-Binomial computations, 2) do not require prior
knowledge of some underlying ""true"" distribution, and 3) can be computed prior
to the collection of any sample data.

were proposed to collaboratively train deep learning models using multiple
end-user devices and a server. CML techniques preserve the privacy of end-users
as it does not require user data to be transferred to the server. Instead,
local models are trained and shared with the server. However, the low resource
utilisation of CML techniques makes the training process inefficient, thereby
limiting the use of CML in the real world. Idling resources both on the server
and devices due to sequential computation and communication is the principal
cause of low resource utilisation. A novel framework PipeLearn that leverages
pipeline parallelism for CML techniques is developed to improve resource
utilisation substantially. A new training pipeline is designed to parallelise
the computations on different hardware resources and communication on different
bandwidth resources, thereby accelerating the training process in CML. The
pipeline is further optimised to ensure maximum utilisation of available
resources. The experimental results confirm the validity of the underlying
approach of PipeLearn and highlight that when compared to federated learning:
(i) the idle time of the server can be reduced by 2.2x - 28.5x, (ii) the
network throughput can be increased by 56.6x - 321.3x, and (iii) the overall
training time can be accelerated by 1.5x - 21.6x under varying network
conditions for two popular convolutional models without sacrificing accuracy.
