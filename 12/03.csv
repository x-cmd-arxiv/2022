the memristive effect, dendritic anti-ambipolar transistor can naturally mimic
Ca2+-mediated regulation of synaptic plasticity (meta-plasticity) at dendritic

resolution (0.03 pc) CO maps of a well-studied high latitude translucent cloud,
MBM 3, to model turbulence. The propagation problem is solved with a modified
Monte Carlo procedure that includes trapping, energization, and ionization
losses. In a homogeneous medium, trapping and re-energization do not produce a
significant effect. In a nonuniform medium, particles can be trapped for a long
time inside the cloud. This modifies the cosmic ray distribution due to
stochastic acceleration at the highest energies (about 100 MeV). At lower
energies, the re-energization is too weak to produce an appreciable effect. The
change in the energy distribution does not significantly affect the ionization
losses, so ionization changes are due to trapping effects.

and the reasons for the diversity of planetary systems. The key to
understanding planet formation is the study of dust evolution from small grains
to pebbles. Smaller grains are well-coupled to the gas dynamics, and their
distribution is significantly extended above the disk midplane. Larger grains
settle much faster and are efficiently formed only in the midplane. By
combining near-infrared polarized light and millimeter observations, it is
possible to constrain the spatial distribution of both the small and large
grains. We aim to construct detailed models of the size distribution and
vertical/radial structure of the dust particles in protoplanetary disks based
on observational data. In particular, we are interested in recovering the dust
distribution in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk. We create a physical model for
the dust distribution of protoplanetary disks and simulate the radiative
transfer of the millimeter continuum and the near-infrared polarized radiation.
Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we compare the derived images to the
observations available for the IM Lup disk to constrain the best physical model
for IM Lup and to recover the vertical grain size distribution. The millimeter
and near-infrared emission tightly constrain the dust mass and grain size
distribution of our model. We find size segregation in the dust distribution,
with millimeter-sized grains in the disk midplane. These grains are efficiently
formed in the disk, possibly by sedimentation-driven coagulation, in accord
with the short settling timescales predicted by our model. This also suggests a

FADO to the spectral database of the SDSS to derive the physical properties of
galaxies. As a comparison, we used the data in the MPA-JHU catalogue, which
contains the properties of SDSS galaxies derived without the nebular
contribution. We selected a sample of SF galaxies with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
flux measurements, and we corrected the fluxes for the nebular extinction
through the Balmer decrement. We then calculated the H$\alpha$ luminosity to
estimate the SFR. Then, by combining the stellar mass and SFR estimates from
FADO and MPA-JHU, the SFMS was obtained. The H$\alpha$ flux estimates are
similar between FADO and MPA-JHU. Because the H$\alpha$ flux was used as tracer
of the SFR, FADO and MPA-JHU agree in their SFR. The stellar mass estimates are
slightly higher for FADO than for MPA-JHU on average. However, considering the
uncertainties, the differences are negligible. With similar SFR and stellar
mass estimates, the derived SFMS is also similar between FADO and MPA-JHU. Our
results show that for SDSS normal SF galaxies, the additional modelling of the
nebular contribution does not affect the retrieved fluxes and consequentially
also does not influence SFR estimators based on the extinction-corrected
H$\alpha$ luminosity. For the stellar masses, the results point to the same
conclusion. These results are a consequence of the fact that the vast majority
of normal SF galaxies in the SDSS have a low nebular contribution.

contention for compute and communication capacities and faulty application
behavior in the presence of overload conditions. Although a large amount of
generated log data can be mined for fault prediction, labeling this data for
training is a manual process and thus a limiting factor for automation. Due to
this, many companies resort to unsupervised fault-tolerance models. Yet,
failure models of this kind can incur a loss of accuracy when they need to
adapt to non-stationary workloads and diverse host characteristics. To cope
with this, we propose a novel modeling approach, called DeepFT, to proactively
avoid system overloads and their adverse effects by optimizing the task
scheduling and migration decisions. DeepFT uses a deep surrogate model to
accurately predict and diagnose faults in the system and co-simulation based
self-supervised learning to dynamically adapt the model in volatile settings.
It offers a highly scalable solution as the model size scales by only 3 and 1
percent per unit increase in the number of active tasks and hosts. Extensive
experimentation on a Raspberry-Pi based edge cluster with DeFog benchmarks
shows that DeepFT can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in
fault-detection and QoS metrics. Specifically, DeepFT gives the highest F1
scores for fault-detection, reducing service deadline violations by up to 37\%
while also improving response time by up to 9%.

luminosities that exceed their radio luminosities by several orders of
magnitude is based on the assumption that the decay with distance of their
gamma-ray fluxes obeys the inverse-square law as does that of their radio
fluxes. The results presented here, of testing the hypothesis of independence
of luminosities and distances of gamma-ray pulsars by means of the
Efron-Petrosian statistic, do not uphold this assumption however: they imply
that the observational data in the Fermi-LAT 12-Year Catalog are consistent
with the dependence $S\propto D^{-3/2}$ of the flux densities $S$ of the
gamma-ray pulsars on their distances $D$ at substantially higher levels of
significance than they are with the dependence $S\propto D^{-2}$. These
results, which were theoretically predicted in Ardavan (2021, MNRAS, 507,
4530), are not incompatible with the requirements of the conservation of energy
because the radiation process by which the superluminally moving current sheet
in the magnetosphere of a neutron star has been shown to generate the slowly
decaying gamma-ray pulses is intrinsically transient: the difference in the
fluxes of power across any two spheres centred on the star is balanced by the
change with time of the energy contained inside the shell bounded by those
spheres. Once the over-estimation of their values is rectified, the
luminosities of gamma-ray pulsars turn out to have the same range of values as
do the luminosities of radio pulsars. This conclusion agrees with that reached
earlier on the basis of the smaller data set in the Second Fermi-LAT Catalog of
Gamma-ray Pulsars.

of two dimensional second-order topological insulators (SOTI). This particular
supersymmetry is induced by applying a half-integer Aharonov-Bohm flux
$f=\Phi/\Phi_0=1/2$ through a hole in the system. Here, three symmetries are
essential to establish this fundamental link: chiral symmetry, inversion
symmetry, and mirror symmetry. At such a flux of half-integer value the mirror
symmetry anticommutes with the inversion symmetry leading to a nontrivial
$n=1$-SUSY representation for the absolute value of the Hamiltonian in each
chiral sector, separately. This implies that a unique zero-energy state and an
exact $2$-fold degeneracy of all eigenstates with non-zero energy is found even
at finite system size. For arbitrary smooth surfaces the link between 2D-SOTI
and SUSY can be described within a universal low-energy theory in terms of an
effective surface Hamiltonian which encompasses the whole class of
supersymmetric periodic Witten models. Applying this general link to the
prototypical example of a Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang-model with an in-plane Zeeman
field, we analyse the entire phase diagram and identify a gapless Weyl phase
separating the topological from the non-topological gapped phase. Surprisingly,
we find that topological states localized at the outer surface remain in the
Weyl phase, whereas topological hole states move to the outer surface and
change their spatial symmetry upon approaching the Weyl phase. Therefore, the
topological hole states can be tuned in a versatile manner opening up a route
towards magnetic-field-induced topological engineering in multi-hole systems.
Finally, we demonstrate the stability of localized states against deviation
from half-integer flux, flux penetration into the sample, surface distortions,

interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) remain unexplained. Here, we
investigate two main topics: (1) the coherence scale of magnetic fields inside
ICMEs, and (2) the dynamic nature of ICME magnetic complexity. We simulate
ICMEs interacting with different solar winds using the linear force-free
spheromak model incorporated into the EUHFORIA model. We place a swarm of
~20000 spacecraft in the 3-D simulation domain and characterize ICME magnetic
complexity and coherence at each spacecraft based on simulated time series. Our
simulations suggest that ICMEs retain a lower complexity and higher coherence
along their magnetic axis, but that a characterization of their global
complexity requires crossings along both the axial and perpendicular
directions. For an ICME of initial half angular width of $45^\circ$ that does
not interact with other large-scale solar wind structures, global complexity
can be characterized by as little as 7-12 spacecraft separated by $25^\circ$,
but the minimum number of spacecraft rises to 50-65 (separated by $10^\circ$)
if interactions occur. Without interactions, ICME coherence extends for
$45^\circ$, $20^\circ$-$30^\circ$, $15^\circ$-$30^\circ$, and
$0^\circ$-$10^\circ$ for $B$, $B_\phi$, $B_\theta$, and $B_r$, respectively.
Coherence is also lower in the ICME west flank compared to the east flank due
to Parker spiral effects. Moreover, coherence is reduced by a factor of 3-6 by
interactions with solar wind structures. Our findings help constrain some of
the critical scales that control the evolution of ICMEs and aid in the planning
of future dedicated multi-spacecraft missions.

method to non-Euclidean input spaces, like the one considered in this paper,
consisting of probability measures. Although a Positive Definite kernel can be
defined by using a suitable distance -- the Wasserstein distance -- the common
procedure for learning the Gaussian Process model can fail due to numerical
issues, arising earlier and more frequently than in the case of an Euclidean
input space and, as demonstrated in this paper, that cannot be avoided by
adding artificial noise (nugget effect) as usually done. This paper uncovers
the main reason of these issues, that is a non-stationarity relationship
between the Wasserstein-based squared exponential kernel and its
Euclidean-based counterpart. As a relevant result, the Gaussian Process model
is learned by assuming the input space as Euclidean and then an algebraic
transformation, based on the uncovered relation, is used to transform it into a
non-stationary and Wasserstein-based Gaussian Process model over probability
measures. This algebraic transformation is simpler than log-exp maps used in

the elementary quasiparticles are intrinsically immobile. These phases may be
described by unconventional gauge theories known as tensor or multipolar gauge
theories, characteristic for so-called type-I or type-II fracton phases,
respectively. Both variants have been associated with distinctive singular
patterns in the spin structure factor, such as multifold pinch points for
type-I and quadratic pinch points for type-II fracton phases. Here, we assess
the impact of quantum fluctuations on these patterns by numerically
investigating the spin $S=1/2$ quantum version of a classical spin model on the

measure for the stability of the corresponding fracton phases. We find that in
all three cases, quantum fluctuations significantly modify the shape of pinch
points or lines by smearing them out and shifting signal away from the
singularities in contrast to effects of pure thermal fluctuations. This
indicates possible fragility of these phases and allows us to identify
characteristic fingerprints of their remnants.

synthetic) is adapted to target data (e.g. real-world) without access to target

visual appearance on the target domain as no ground truth is available to learn
the slight appearance differences. To address this problem, we propose a Masked
Image Consistency (MIC) module to enhance UDA by learning spatial context
relations of the target domain as additional clues for robust visual
recognition. MIC enforces the consistency between predictions of masked target
images, where random patches are withheld, and pseudo-labels that are generated
based on the complete image by an exponential moving average teacher. To
minimize the consistency loss, the network has to learn to infer the
predictions of the masked regions from their context. Due to its simple and
universal concept, MIC can be integrated into various UDA methods across
different visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic
segmentation, and object detection. MIC significantly improves the
state-of-the-art performance across the different recognition tasks for
synthetic-to-real, day-to-nighttime, and clear-to-adverse-weather UDA. For
instance, MIC achieves an unprecedented UDA performance of 75.9 mIoU and 92.8%

improvement of +2.1 and +3.0 percent points over the previous state of the art.

robotics and control applications, especially as models for dynamical systems.
Such data-driven models are in turn used for designing and verifying autonomous
systems. They are particularly useful in modeling medical systems where data
can be leveraged to individualize treatment. In safety-critical applications,
it is important that the data-driven model is conformant to established
knowledge from the natural sciences. Such knowledge is often available or can
often be distilled into a (possibly black-box) model. For instance, an F1
racing car should conform to Newton's laws (which are encoded within a unicycle
model). In this light, we consider the following problem - given a model $M$
and a state transition dataset, we wish to best approximate the system model
while being a bounded distance away from $M$. We propose a method to guarantee
this conformance. Our first step is to distill the dataset into a few
representative samples called memories, using the idea of a growing neural gas.
Next, using these memories we partition the state space into disjoint subsets
and compute bounds that should be respected by the neural network in each
subset. This serves as a symbolic wrapper for guaranteed conformance. We argue
theoretically that this only leads to a bounded increase in approximation
error; which can be controlled by increasing the number of memories. We
experimentally show that on three case studies (Car Model, Drones, and
Artificial Pancreas), our constrained neurosymbolic models conform to specified
models (each encoding various constraints) with order-of-magnitude improvements

  Computing through Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud computing holds the promise of reduced costs through economies of
scale. To realize this promise, cloud computing vendors typically solve
sequential resource allocation problems, where customer workloads are packed on
shared hardware. Virtual machines (VM) form the foundation of modern cloud
computing as they help logically abstract user compute from shared physical
infrastructure. Traditionally, VM packing problems are solved by predicting
demand, followed by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization over a future
horizon. We introduce an approximate formulation of an industrial VM packing
problem as an MILP with soft-constraints parameterized by the predictions.
Recently, predict-and-optimize (PnO) was proposed for end-to-end training of
prediction models by back-propagating the cost of decisions through the
optimization problem. But, PnO is unable to scale to the large prediction
horizons prevalent in cloud computing. To tackle this issue, we propose the
Predict-and-Critic (PnC) framework that outperforms PnO with just a two-step
horizon by leveraging reinforcement learning. PnC jointly trains a prediction
model and a terminal Q function that approximates cost-to-go over a long
horizon, by back-propagating the cost of decisions through the optimization
problem \emph{and from the future}. The terminal Q function allows us to solve
a much smaller two-step horizon optimization problem than the multi-step
horizon necessary in PnO. We evaluate PnO and the PnC framework on two
datasets, three workloads, and with disturbances not modeled in the
optimization problem. We find that PnC significantly improves decision quality
over PnO, even when the optimization problem is not a perfect representation of
reality. We also find that hardening the soft constraints of the MILP and
back-propagating through the constraints improves decision quality for both PnO
and PnC.

quantifying and accounting for model uncertainty at the DT that is caused by

foregrounds an existential imperative of intelligent systems; namely, curiosity
or the resolution of uncertainty. This same imperative underwrites belief
sharing in ensembles of agents, in which certain aspects (i.e., factors) of

for delay-sensitive Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. In order to obtain a
timely detection of burst jamming, we propose an online principal direction
anomaly detection (OPDAD) method. We consider the one-ring scatter channel
model, where the base station equipped with a large number of antennas is
elevated at a high altitude. In this case, since the angular spread of the
legitimate IoT transmitter or the jammer is restricted within a narrow region,
there is a distinct difference of the principal direction of the signal space
between the jamming attack and the normal state. Unlike existing statistical
features based batching methods, the proposed OPDAD method adopts an online
iterative processing mode, which can quickly detect the exact attack time block
instance by analyzing the newly coming signal. In addition, our detection
method does not rely on the prior knowledge of the attacker, because it only
cares the abrupt change in the principal direction of the signal space.
Moreover, based on the high spatial resolution and the narrow angular spread,
we provide the convergence rate estimate and derive a nearly optimal finite
sample error bound for the proposed OPDAD method. Numerical results show the
excellent real time capability and detection performance of our proposed
method.

thermal radiation from radio to ultraviolet. The quiet Sun produces also
non-thermal radiation observed in gamma rays due to interactions of Galactic
Cosmic Rays (GCR) with the solar gas and photons. We report on a new component:
the synchrotron emission by GCR electrons in the solar magnetic field. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first time this emission has been
theoretically claimed and modeled. We find that the measured GCR electrons with
energies from tens of GeV to a few TeV produce synchrotron emission in X-rays,
which is a few orders of magnitude lower than current upper limits of the quiet
Sun set by RHESSI and FOXSI. For a radially decreasing solar magnetic field we
find the expected synchrotron intensity to be almost constant in the solar
disk, to peak in the close proximity of the Sun, and to quickly drop away from
the Sun. We also estimate the synchrotron emission from radio to gamma rays and
we compare it with current observations, especially with LOFAR. While it is
negligible from radio to UV compared to the solar thermal radiation, this
emission can potentially be observed at high energies with NuSTAR and more
promising future FOXSI observations. This could potentially allow for
constraining CR densities and magnetic-field intensities at the Sun. This study
provides a more complete description and a possible new way for understanding

$\sim1500$ K to $\sim6000$ K and this increases optical lags to match the lag
data. Most of the disc surface maintains the cooler $T\propto r^{-3/4}$
temperature profile that matches the SED. The bright lamp-post may be powered
by magnetic links tapping the black hole spin. The steep rim occurs near the
sublimation radius for dust in the disc, as in the ""failed disc wind model"" for
broad-line clouds. Lens-Thirring torques aligning the disc and black hole spin
may also raise a warp and associated waves. In both scenarios, the small
density scale height implied by the inferred value of $H(r)$ suggests possible
marginal gravitational instability in the disc.

goal is to identify and study [WC11] stars, the coolest of the low-mass
Wolf-Rayet sequence, and a subset of central stars of planetary nebulae where
the C II lines are known to be especially prominent. A recent serendipitous
discovery of an LMC [WC11] raised the possibility that these objects, although
difficult to identify, might in fact be more common than previously believed.
Several new members of this rare class have been found in this survey. It now
seems clear, however, that a significant number of these stars are not hiding
amongst the general [WC] population. We point out that the C II doublet
intensity ratio observed in our spectra proves to neatly divide the objects
into two distinct groups, with the C II emission likely originating from either
the stellar wind or a surrounding nebula. The physics of the C II emission
mechanism correctly explains this bifurcation. Spectral subtypes are suggested
for most of the objects. The numerous spectroscopic clues now available for
these objects should facilitate future detailed modeling.

the pose and appearance of objects, de facto generating entire 3D volumes

tasks can be performed in standard 2D-based GANs (e.g., StyleGAN models) as
manipulation of latent dimensions. However, to the best of our knowledge,
similar properties have only been partially explored for 3D-aware GAN models.
This work aims to fill this gap by showing the limitations of existing methods
and proposing LatentSwap3D, a model-agnostic approach designed to enable
attribute editing in the latent space of pre-trained 3D-aware GANs. We first
identify the most relevant dimensions in the latent space of the model
controlling the targeted attribute by relying on the feature importance ranking
of a random forest classifier. Then, to apply the transformation, we swap the
top-K most relevant latent dimensions of the image being edited with an image
exhibiting the desired attribute. Despite its simplicity, LatentSwap3D provides
remarkable semantic edits in a disentangled manner and outperforms alternative
approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. We demonstrate our semantic
edit approach on various 3D-aware generative models such as pi-GAN, GIRAFFE,
StyleSDF, MVCGAN, EG3D and VolumeGAN, and on diverse datasets, such as FFHQ,

nebular properties of these associated galaxies and find the following: i)
27/32 absorbers have galaxy counterparts and more than 50 per cent of the
absorbers have two or more associated galaxies, ii) the \ion{H}{i} column
density of absorbers is anti-correlated with the impact parameter (scaled by

star cluster (NSC) that includes observational constraints from a large sample
of stellar metallicity measurements. These metallicity measurements were
obtained from recent surveys from Gemini and VLT of 770 late-type stars within
the central 1.5 pc. These metallicity measurements, along with photometry and
spectroscopically derived temperatures, are forward modeled with a Bayesian
inference approach. Including metallicity measurements improves the overall fit
quality, as the low-temperature red giants that were previously difficult to
constrain are now accounted for, and the best fit favors a two-component model.
The dominant component contains 93%$\pm$3% of the mass, is metal-rich
($\overline{[M/H]}\sim$0.45), and has an age of 5$^{+3}_{-2}$ Gyr, which is
$\sim$3 Gyr younger than earlier studies with fixed (solar) metallicity; this
younger age challenges co-evolutionary models in which the NSC and supermassive
black holes formed simultaneously at early times. The minor population
component has low metallicity ($\overline{[M/H]}\sim$ -1.1) and contains
$\sim$7% of the stellar mass. The age of the minor component is uncertain (0.1
- 5 Gyr old). Using the estimated parameters, we infer the following NSC
stellar remnant population (with $\sim$18% uncertainty): 1.5$\times$10$^5$
neutron stars, 2.5$\times$10$^5$ stellar mass black holes (BHs) and
2.2$\times$10$^4$ BH-BH binaries. These predictions result in 2-4 times fewer
neutron stars compared to earlier predictions that assume solar metallicity,
introducing a possible new path to understand the so-called ""missing pulsar

environment of bright astrophysical sources. Many information on the gas
physics, chemistry and kinematics, as well as on the ionising source itself,
can be gathered through optical to X-ray spectroscopy. While several public
time equilibrium photoionisation codes are readily available and can be used to
infer average gas properties at equilibrium, time-evolving photoionisation
models have only very recently started to become available. They are needed
when the ionising source varies faster than the typical gas equilibration
timescale. Indeed, using equilibrium models to analyse spectra of
non-equilibrium gas may lead to inaccurate results and prevents a solid
assessment of the gas density, physics and geometry. We present our novel
Time-Evolving PhotoIonisation Device (TEPID), which self-consistently solves
time evolving photoionisation equations (thermal and ionisation balance) and
follows the response of the gas to changes of the ionising source. The code can
be applied to a variety of astrophysical scenarios and produces time-resolved
gas absorption spectra to fit the data. To describe the main features of TEPID,
we apply it to two dramatically different astrophysical scenarios: a typical
ionised absorber observed in the X-ray spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g.
Warm Absorbers and UFOs) and the circumburst environment of a Gamma-Ray Burst.
In both cases, the gas energy and ionisation balances vary as a function of
time, gas density and distance from the ionising source. Time evolving
ionisation leads to unique ionisation patterns which cannot be reproduced by
stationary codes when the gas is out of equilibrium. This demonstrates the need
for codes such as TEPID in view of the up-coming high-resolution X-ray
spectrometers onboard missions like XRISM or Athena.

comprehensive non-equilibrium chemical evolution model~(NE-CEM) to constrain
the mass-loading factor $\eta$ of outflows using the metallicity-stellar

enrichment by explicitly tracking both the histories of star formation and
mass-loading. After exploring the EAGLE simulation, we discover a compact yet
flexible model that accurately describes the average star formation histories
of galaxies. Applying a novel method of chemically measuring $\eta$ to EAGLE,
we find $\eta$ can be parametrised by its dependence on stellar mass and
specific SFR as $\log\eta\propto M_*^{\alpha}s{\mathrm{SFR}}^{\beta}$, with
$\alpha{=}{-}0.12$ and $\beta{=}0.32$ in EAGLE. Our chemically-inferred $\eta$
agrees remarkably well with the kinematic measurements by Mitchell et al. After
extensive tests with EAGLE, we apply an NE-CEM Bayesian analysis to the SDSS

successfully reproduce the so-called ""fundamental metallicity relation'' at

and one where the cross section is velocity-dependent. We analyse the halo
density profiles and concentrations, comparing the predictions of
dark-matter-only and hydrodynamical simulations in all scenarios. We calculate
the best-fit Einasto profiles and compare the resulting parameters with
previous studies and define the best-fit concentration-mass relations. We find
that the inclusion of baryons reduces the differences between different dark
matter models with respect to the DM-only case. In SIDM hydro runs, deviations
from the CDM density profiles weakly depend on mass: the most massive systems
($M>10^{13}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$) show cored profiles, while the least massive ones
($M<10^{12.5}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$) have cuspier profiles. Finally, we compare the
predictions of our simulations to observational results, by looking at the dark
matter fractions and the distribution of strong lensing Einstein radii. We find
that in SIDM the DM-fractions decrease more rapidly with increasing stellar
mass than in CDM, leading to lower fractions at $M_{*}>10^{11}M_{\odot}$, a
distinctive signature of SIDM. At the same time, the distribution of Einstein
radii, derived from both CDM and SIDM hydro runs, is comparable to observed
samples of strong lenses with $M>10^{13}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$. We conclude that the

able to separate the dark and luminous mass in the inner regions of galaxies

star-forming region. Here, we provide evidence of a possible formation
mechanism for Barnard's Loop and compare our results with recent work
suggesting a major feedback event occurred in the region around 6 Myr ago. We
present a 3D model of the large-scale Orion region, indicating coherent,
radial, 3D expansion of the OBP-Near/Brice\~{n}o-1 (OBP-B1) cluster in the
middle of a large dust cavity. The large-scale gas in the region also appears
to be expanding from a central point, originally proposed to be Orion X. OBP-B1
appears to serve as another possible center, and we evaluate whether Orion X or
OBP-B1 is more likely to be the cause of the expansion. We find that neither
cluster served as the single expansion center, but rather a combination of
feedback from both likely propelled the expansion. Recent 3D dust maps are used
to characterize the 3D topology of the entire region, which shows Barnard's
Loop's correspondence with a large dust cavity around the OPB-B1 cluster. The
molecular clouds Orion A, Orion B, and Orion $\lambda$ reside on the shell of
this cavity. Simple estimates of gravitational effects from both stars and gas
indicate that the expansion of this asymmetric cavity likely induced anisotropy
in the kinematics of OBP-B1. We conclude that feedback from OBP-B1 has affected
the structure of the Orion A, Orion B, and Orion $\lambda$ molecular clouds and
may have played a major role in the formation of Barnard's Loop.

develop a self-supervised generative model to jointly synthesize expressive,

generation for 3D faces by adversarial self-supervised training, guided by
differentiable rendering against collections of real RGB images. Controllable
editing and manipulation are given by language prompts to adapt texture and

that predicts both texture and expression latent codes of the morphable model.
Our model is trained in a self-supervised fashion by exploiting differentiable
rendering and losses based on a pre-trained CLIP model. Once trained, our model
jointly predicts face textures in UV-space, along with expression parameters to
capture both geometry and texture changes in facial expressions in a single
forward pass. We further show the applicability of our method to generate
temporally changing textures for a given animation sequence.

study, it is shown that a family of circular distributions based on nonnegative

of NNTS circular distributions to model multimodality and skewness, these are
good candidates for use as alternative models to test for circular uniformity
to detect different deviations from the null hypothesis of circular uniformity.
The circular uniform distribution is a member of the NNTS family, but in the
NNTS parameter space, it corresponds to a point on the boundary of the
parameter space, implying that the regularity conditions are not satisfied when
the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Two NNTS
tests for circular uniformity were developed by considering the standardised
maximum likelihood estimator and the generalised likelihood ratio. Given the
non-regularity condition, the critical values of the proposed NNTS circular
uniformity tests were obtained via simulation. By generating new models close
to the circular uniformity null hypothesis, the proposed NNTS circular

nonlinearity of structural systems and to provide a mathematically proven basis
for applying partial safety factors to nonlinear structural systems. It
establishes, for the first time since the development of limit-state theory,
the necessary key relationship between the partial safety factor concept and
the reliability theory of nonlinear structural systems. The degree of
homogeneity has been introduced as a nonlinearity measure at the design point,
allowing an efficient mathematical decoupling of the reliability index into
nonlinearity-invariant partial reliability indexes. With this formulation,
critical safety situations in extreme cases of nonlinearities have been
identified in complex nonlinear structural systems. The theory resulted in two
main outcomes based on the asymptotic behaviour of the reliability index.
First, the reliability index of any nonlinear structural system remains always
bounded between an upper and lower bound, which can be determined by the
concept of nonlinearity-invariant partial reliability indexes. The second is
nonlinearity-invariant critical partial safety factors, a concept that assures
a reliability index greater than the target reliability index in any nonlinear
structural system. Homogeneity analysis has been suggested to assess the safety
of complex nonlinear structural systems. While it can be coupled with advanced
computational methods available in structural mechanics, it is not specifically
designed for engineering practice. The proposed theory is designed primarily to
provide code writers with the necessary procedure for calibrating partial
safety factors for nonlinear structural systems, and to identify the over-safe

task that bridges the gap between classic object detection (OD) benchmarks and
object detection in the real world. In addition to detecting and classifying
seen/labeled objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to detect novel/unknown
objects - which can be classified and incrementally learned. In standard OD,
object proposals not overlapping with a labeled object are automatically
classified as background. Therefore, simply applying OD methods to OWOD fails
as unknown objects would be predicted as background. The challenge of detecting
unknown objects stems from the lack of supervision in distinguishing unknown
objects and background object proposals. Previous OWOD methods have attempted
to overcome this issue by generating supervision using pseudo-labeling -
however, unknown object detection has remained low. Probabilistic/generative
models may provide a solution for this challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel
probabilistic framework for objectness estimation, where we alternate between
probability distribution estimation and objectness likelihood maximization of
known objects in the embedded feature space - ultimately allowing us to

enables unsupervised clustering to create an interpretable pedestrian behavior
dictionary. We show the utility of this dictionary for building pedestrian
behavior maps to visualize space usage patterns and for computing the
distributions of behaviors. We demonstrate a simple but effective trajectory
prediction by conditioning on these behavior labels. While many trajectory

additional functionality out of solvers, many training simulations, or both.
Current machine learning techniques often require substantial computational

select mesh vertices for removal and solution interpolation is used to bypass
expensive simulations at each step in the improvement process. MeshDQN requires
a single simulation prior to mesh coarsening, while making no assumptions about

convergence map provides similar information as the frequency map but in a much
shorter computing time. The dynamic equation can be rewritten in terms of
action-angle variables provided by the square matrix derived from the
accelerator lattice. The convergence map is obtained by solving the exact
nonlinear equation iteratively by the perturbation method using Fourier
transform and studying convergence. When the iteration is convergent, the
solution is expressed as a quasi-periodic analytical function as a highly
accurate approximation, and hence the motion is stable. The border of stable
motion determines the dynamical aperture. As an example, we applied the new
method to the nonlinear optimization of the NSLS-II storage ring and
demonstrated a dynamic aperture comparable to or larger than the nominal one
obtained by particle tracking. The computation speed of the convergence map is
30 to 300 times faster than the speed of the particle tracking, depending on
the size of the ring lattice (number of superperiods). The computation speed

important challenge in HAT is to transform autonomous systems into better
teammates, capable of joining humans in highly interdependent activities. The
presented works explore two main avenues, supported by industrial
collaborations (in the domain of transportation and industrial systems),
academic partnerships (especially with South Australian universities), and with
the supervision PhD students. The first axis deals with the monitoring of
cognitive states, to equip the machine with an ability to detect when human
face difficulties. To address this question, a global approach is proposed to
classify operators mental workload from the fusion of multisourced
physiological and behavioral data. The second axis focused on the mechanisms
for adapting human-autonomy teaming, making machine more compatible with human.
Two kinds of solution are explored. One focused on the offline enhancement of
the know-how-to-cooperate of machines, with the aid of CWA method and MDE
techniques. The other deals with online adaptation of human-machine
cooperation, where autonomous system can be considered inside the team - as a
teammate - or above the team-as a coach. Finally, new research directions are
opened, supported by ongoing initiatives in France and abroad. These
perspectives relate to the consolidation of a multilevel approach for cognitive

able to more effectively align the tokens compared to standard methods. These
multimodal representations, which we call compound tokens are generated with
cross-attention transformer layers. First, vision tokens are used as queries to
retrieve compatible text tokens through cross-attention. We then chain the
vision tokens and the queried text tokens along the channel dimension. We call
the resulting representations compound tokens. A second group of compound
tokens are generated using an analogous process where the text tokens serve as
queries to the cross-attention layer. We concatenate all the compound tokens
for further processing with multimodal encoder. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of compound tokens using an encoder-decoder vision-language model

highly competitive performance across a range of question answering tasks

heterogeneous data has been facilitating personalized FL solutions, where,

personalized FL algorithms, the collaborative knowledge across the federation

regularization. We observed that this implicit knowledge transfer fails to
maximize the potential value of each client's empirical risk toward other

Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL framework that enables each
client to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively
aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. To avoid massive

risk is estimated through a first-order approximation for other clients'
adaptive risk aggregation. On top of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade,
dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently utilize clients' empirical risks. Our
extensive experiments under different federated settings with benchmark

annotations may lead to localization and counting errors during prediction. A

applies loss-aware dataset pruning to iteratively remove the least significant

reducing the convergence time and improving generalization. To our knowledge,
the idea of data pruning as an embedded process in curriculum learning is

Efficient high-fidelity coupling of the initial pulses is very important for
system performance. Here we study the effect of self-focusing in gas-cell
windows on the coupling of ultrafast laser pulses into hollow-core fibres using
(2+1)-dimensional numerical simulations. As expected, we find that the coupling
efficiency is degraded and the duration of the coupled pulses changed when the
entrance window is too close to the fibre entrance. The interplay of nonlinear
spatio-temporal reshaping and the linear dispersion of the window create
different results depending on the window material, pulse duration, and pulse
wavelength, with longer-wavelength beams more tolerant of high intensity in the
window. While shifting the nominal focus to compensate can restore some of the
lost coupling efficiency, it improves the pulse duration only marginally. From
our simulations we derive a simple expression for the minimum distance between
the window and the HCF entrance facet. Our results have implications for the
often space-constrained design of hollow-core-fibre systems, especially where

characterize the capacity region of such a quantum switch under noisy channel

deformation requirement that during drained expansion the progressive
development of the radial and tangential strains must maintain to be

  Experience (QoMEX), 2020, pp. 1-6,","10.1109/QoMEX48832.2020.9123105",,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) method as described in the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendation ITU-R BS.1387 has
been widely used for computationally estimating the quality of perceptually
coded audio signals without the need for extensive subjective listening tests.
However, many reports have highlighted clear limitations of the scheme after
the end of its standardization, particularly involving signals coded with newer
technologies such as bandwidth extension or parametric multi-channel coding.
Until now, no other method for measuring the quality of both speech and audio
signals has been standardized by the ITU. Therefore, a further investigation of
the causes for these limitations would be beneficial to a possible update of
said scheme. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of PEAQ's
model of disturbance loudness is still as good as (and sometimes superior to)
other state-of-the-art objective measures, albeit with varying performance
depending on the type of degraded signal content (i.e. speech or music). This
finding evidences the need for an improved cognitive model. In addition,
results indicate that an updated mapping of Model Output Values (MOVs) to
PEAQ's Distortion Index (DI) based on newer training data can greatly improve
performance. Finally, some suggestions for the improvement of PEAQ are provided
based on the reported results and comparison to other systems.

  Visual Analytics Knowledge Discovery Applications",,,,,"cs.HC cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual Analytics (VA) tools provide ways for users to harness insights and
knowledge from datasets. Recalling and retelling user experiences while
utilizing VA tools has attracted significant interest. Nevertheless, each user
sessions are unique. Even when different users have the same intention when
using a VA tool, they may follow different paths and uncover different
insights. Current methods of manually processing such data to recall and retell
users' knowledge discovery paths may also be time-consuming, especially when
there is the need to present users' findings to third parties. This paper
presents a novel system that collects user intentions, behavior, and insights
during knowledge discovery sessions, automatically structure the data, and
extracts narrations of knowledge discovery as PowerPoint slide decks. The
system is powered by a Knowledge Graph designed based on a formal and
reproducible modeling process. To evaluate our system, we have attached it to
two existing VA tools where users were asked to perform pre-defined tasks.
Several slide decks and other analysis metrics were extracted from the
generated Knowledge Graph. Experts scrutinized and confirmed the usefulness of
our automated process for using the slide decks to disclose knowledge discovery
paths to others and to verify whether the VA tools themselves were effective.

segmentation of the objects within the scene. It also includes the
interpretation of the structure and arrangement of the scene elements. Such
understanding is often rooted in recognizing the physical world and its
limitations, and in prior knowledge as to how similar typical scenes are
arranged. In this research we pose a new challenge for neural network (or
other) scene understanding algorithms - can they distinguish between plausible
and implausible scenes? Plausibility can be defined both in terms of physical
properties and in terms of functional and typical arrangements. Hence, we
define plausibility as the probability of encountering a given scene in the
real physical world. We build a dataset of synthetic images containing both
plausible and implausible scenes, and test the success of various vision models
in the task of recognizing and understanding plausibility.

distribution networks and transmission network boundaries. Therefore, this
paper addresses the conditions for estimating sensitivities of voltage
magnitudes with respect to complex (active and reactive) electric power
injections based on sensor measurements. These sensitivities represent
submatrices of the inverse power flow Jacobian. We extend previous results to
show that the sensitivities of a bus voltage magnitude with respect to active
power injections are unique and different from those with respect to reactive
power. The classical Newton-Raphson power flow model is used to derive a novel
representation of bus voltage magnitudes as an underdetermined linear operator
of the active and reactive power injections; parameterized by the bus power
factors. Two conditions that ensure the existence of unique complex power
injections given voltage magnitudes are established for this underdetermined
linear system, thereby compressing the solution space. The first is a
sufficient condition based on the bus power factors. The second is a necessary
and sufficient condition based on the system eigenvalues. We use matrix
completion theory to develop estimation methods for recovering sensitivity
matrices with varying levels of sensor availability. Simulations verify the
results and demonstrate engineering use of the proposed methods.

  with Longitudinal Binary Outcomes",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Construction of just-in-time adaptive interventions, such as prompts
delivered by mobile apps to promote and maintain behavioral change, requires
knowledge about time-varying moderated effects to inform when and how we
deliver intervention options. Micro-randomized trials (MRT) have emerged as a
sequentially randomized design to gather requisite data for effect estimation.
The existing literature (Qian et al., 2020; Boruvka et al., 2018; Dempsey et
al., 2020) has defined a general class of causal estimands, referred to as
""causal excursion effects"", to assess the time-varying moderated effect.
However, there is limited statistical literature on how to address potential
between-cluster treatment effect heterogeneity and within-cluster interference
in a sequential treatment setting for longitudinal binary outcomes. In this
paper, based on a cluster conceptualization of the potential outcomes, we
define a larger class of direct and indirect causal excursion effects for
proximal and lagged binary outcomes, and propose a new inferential procedure
that addresses effect heterogeneity and interference. We provide theoretical
guarantees of consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Extensive
simulation studies confirm our theory empirically and show the proposed
procedure provides consistent point estimator and interval estimates with valid
coverage. Finally, we analyze a data set from a multi-institution MRT study to
assess the time-varying moderated effects of mobile prompts upon binary study
engagement outcomes.

performs a search tree traversal following the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. Prior
works on parallelizing MCE on GPUs perform a breadth-first traversal of the
tree, which has limited scalability because of the explosion in the number of
tree nodes at deep levels. We propose to parallelize MCE on GPUs by performing
depth-first traversal of independent sub-trees in parallel. Since MCE suffers
from high load imbalance and memory capacity requirements, we propose a worker
list for dynamic load balancing, as well as partial induced sub-graphs and a
compact representation of excluded vertex sets to regulate memory consumption.
Our evaluation shows that our GPU implementation on a single GPU outperforms
the state-of-the-art parallel CPU implementation by a geometric mean of 4.9x
(up to 16.7x), and scales efficiently to multiple GPUs. Our code will be
open-sourced to enable further research on accelerating MCE.

the surface potential mapping and enables rigid in vivo analysis of transport
properties of an active electronic device incorporated into a complex
integrated circuit. The study is inspired by our ongoing development of a
millimeter wave intelligent reflective surface for 6G communications. To
provide desired beamforming capabilities, such a surface should utilize
hundreds of identical microscale GaAs diode switches with series resistance of
a few ohms. Thus, we develop a ladder-like layered ohmic contact to heavily
Si-doped GaAs and cross-study it via transmission line method and Kelvin probe
force microscopy. The contact resistivity as low as 0.15~$\mu \Omega \,$cm$^2$
is measured resulting in only a 0.6~$\Omega$ of resistance for the contact area
of 3$\times$3~$\mu$m$^2$. Moreover, the tendencies observed suggest that one
can rigidly analyze the evolution of contact resistance and the profile of
resistivity under contact in response to rapid thermal annealing, once the
surface potential map across the ``ladder'' is known.

the entire range of electron-phonon coupling $g_2$, from the system's stability
threshold at attractive $g_2=-1$ to arbitrary strong repulsion at $g_2 \gg 1$.
Key properties of quadratic polarons prove dramatically different from their
linear counterparts. They (i) are insensitive even to large quadratic coupling
except in the anti-adiabatic limit near the threshold of instability at
attraction; (ii) depend only on the adiabatic ratio but are insensitive to the
electron dispersion and dimension of space; (iii) feature weak lattice
deformations even at the instability point. Our results are of direct relevance
to properties of electrons at low densities in polar materials, including
recent proposals for their superconducting states.

  Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run",,,,"https://dcc.ligo.org/P2200139","astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe a search for gravitational waves from compact binaries with at
least one component with mass 0.2 $M_\odot$ -- $1.0 M_\odot$ and mass ratio $q
\geq 0.1$ in Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data collected between 1 November
2019, 15:00 UTC and 27 March 2020, 17:00 UTC. No signals were detected. The
most significant candidate has a false alarm rate of 0.2 $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We
estimate the sensitivity of our search over the entirety of Advanced LIGO's and
Advanced Virgo's third observing run, and present the most stringent limits to
date on the merger rate of binary black holes with at least one subsolar-mass
component. We use the upper limits to constrain two fiducial scenarios that
could produce subsolar-mass black holes: primordial black holes (PBH) and a
model of dissipative dark matter. The PBH model uses recent prescriptions for
the merger rate of PBH binaries that include a rate suppression factor to
effectively account for PBH early binary disruptions. If the PBHs are
monochromatically distributed, we can exclude a dark matter fraction in PBHs
$f_\mathrm{PBH} \gtrsim 0.6$ (at 90% confidence) in the probed subsolar-mass
range. However, if we allow for broad PBH mass distributions we are unable to
rule out $f_\mathrm{PBH} = 1$. For the dissipative model, where the dark matter
has chemistry that allows a small fraction to cool and collapse into black
holes, we find an upper bound $f_{\mathrm{DBH}} < 10^{-5}$ on the fraction of
atomic dark matter collapsed into black holes.

  optimisation problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Taking uncertainty into account is crucial when making strategic decisions.
To guard against the risk of adverse scenarios, traditional optimisation
techniques incorporate uncertainty on the basis of prior knowledge on its
distribution. In this paper, we show how, based on a limited amount of
historical data, we can generate from a low-dimensional space the underlying
structure of uncertainty that could then be used in such optimisation
frameworks. To this end, we first exploit the correlation between the sources
of uncertainty through a principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality.
Next, we perform clustering to reveal the typical uncertainty patterns, and
finally we generate polyhedral uncertainty sets based on a kernel density
estimation (KDE) of marginal probability functions.

  Documentation",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Outdated documentation is a pervasive problem in software development,
preventing effective use of software, and misleading users and developers
alike. We posit that one possible reason why documentation becomes out of sync
so easily is that developers are unaware of when their source code
modifications render the documentation obsolete. Ensuring that the
documentation is always in sync with the source code takes considerable effort,
especially for large codebases. To address this situation, we propose an
approach that can automatically detect code element references that survive in
the documentation after all source code instances have been deleted. In this
work, we analysed over 3,000 GitHub projects and found that most projects
contain at least one outdated code element reference at some point in their
history. We submitted GitHub issues to real-world projects containing outdated
references detected by our approach, some of which have already led to
documentation fixes. As an initiative toward keeping documentation in software
repositories up-to-date, we have made our implementation available for
developers to scan their GitHub projects for outdated code element references.

moment activation (MA) faithfully captures the nonlinear coupling of correlated
neural variability. However, numerical evaluation of the MA faces significant
challenges due to a number of ill-conditioned Dawson-like functions. By
deriving asymptotic expansions of these functions, we develop an efficient
numerical algorithm for evaluating the MA and its derivatives ensuring
reliability, speed, and accuracy. We also provide exact analytical expressions
for the MA in the weak fluctuation limit. Powered by this efficient algorithm,
the MA may serve as an effective tool for investigating the dynamics of
correlated neural variability in large-scale spiking neural circuits.

meteorological data collected at an onshore wind farm and then assessed in
terms of fidelity and accuracy for predictions of wind speed, turbulence
intensity, and power capture at the turbine and wind farm levels for different
wind and atmospheric conditions. ML methods for data quality control and
pre-processing are applied to the data set under investigation and found to
outperform standard statistical methods. A hybrid model, comprised of a linear
interpolation model, Gaussian process, deep neural network (DNN), and support
vector machine, paired with a DNN filter, is found to achieve high accuracy for
modeling wind turbine power capture. Modifications of the incoming freestream
wind speed and turbulence intensity, $TI$, due to the evolution of the wind
field over the wind farm and effects associated with operating turbines are
also captured using DNN models. Thus, turbine-level modeling is achieved using
models for predicting power capture while farm-level modeling is achieved by
combining models predicting wind speed and $TI$ at each turbine location from
freestream conditions with models predicting power capture. Combining these
models provides results consistent with expected power capture performance and
holds promise for future endeavors in wind farm modeling and diagnostics.
Though training ML models is computationally expensive, using the trained
models to simulate the entire wind farm takes only a few seconds on a typical
modern laptop computer, and the total computational cost is still lower than
other available mid-fidelity simulation approaches.

linguists have capitalized on this fact to build large language models (LLMs)
that acquire co-occurrence-based knowledge from language corpora. LLMs achieve
impressive performance on many tasks, but the robustness of their world
knowledge has been questioned. Here, we ask: do LLMs acquire generalized
knowledge about real-world events? Using curated sets of minimal sentence pairs
(n=1215), we tested whether LLMs are more likely to generate plausible event
descriptions compared to their implausible counterparts. We found that LLMs
systematically distinguish possible and impossible events (The teacher bought
the laptop vs. The laptop bought the teacher) but fall short of human
performance when distinguishing likely and unlikely events (The nanny tutored
the boy vs. The boy tutored the nanny). In follow-up analyses, we show that (i)
LLM scores are driven by both plausibility and surface-level sentence features,
(ii) LLMs generalize well across syntactic sentence variants (active vs
passive) but less well across semantic sentence variants (synonymous
sentences), (iii) some, but not all LLM deviations from ground-truth labels
align with crowdsourced human judgments, and (iv) explicit event plausibility
information emerges in middle LLM layers and remains high thereafter. Overall,
our analyses reveal a gap in LLMs' event knowledge, highlighting their
limitations as generalized knowledge bases. We conclude by speculating that the
differential performance on impossible vs. unlikely events is not a temporary
setback but an inherent property of LLMs, reflecting a fundamental difference
between linguistic knowledge and world knowledge in intelligent systems.

the motion of the viscous fluids, such as liquids, gases, gels, polymers. The
present article is a spotlight on the NSE problem: a review of the past and

singularity at a finite-time (blowup); given some initial conditions. While in
the past, the focus was on finding bounds for the smooth solutions, recently,
there has been growing interest in finding solutions that blowup. The current

connects the discipline of fluid mechanics to disciplines like, 'neuromorphic

wide range of biological functions and enhance the transcription of target
genes. Although many state-of-the-art computational methods have been proposed
in order to efficiently identify enhancers, learning globally contextual
features is still one of the challenges for computational methods. Regarding
the similarities between biological sequences and natural language sentences,
the novel BERT-based language techniques have been applied to extracting
complex contextual features in various computational biology tasks such as
protein function/structure prediction. To speed up the research on enhancer
identification, it is urgent to construct a BERT-based enhancer language model.
  Results: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale enhancer identification
method (iEnhancer-ELM) based on enhancer language models, which treat enhancer
sequences as natural language sentences that are composed of k-mer nucleotides.
iEnhancer-ELM can extract contextual information of multi-scale k-mers with
positions from raw enhancer sequences. Benefiting from the complementary
information of k-mers in multi-scale, we ensemble four iEnhancer-ELM models for
improving enhancer identification. The benchmark comparisons show that our
model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. By the interpretable attention
mechanism, we finds 30 biological patterns, where 40% (12/30) are verified by a
widely used motif tool (STREME) and a popular dataset (JASPAR), demonstrating
our model has a potential ability to reveal the biological mechanism of
enhancer.

the environment a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward while
satisfying minimum requirements in secondary cumulative reward constraints.
Several algorithms rooted in sampled-based primal-dual methods have been
recently proposed to solve this problem in policy space. However, such methods
are based on stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithms whose trajectories
are connected to the optimal policy only after a mixing output stage that
depends on the algorithm's history. As a result, there is a mismatch between
the behavioral policy and the optimal one. In this work, we propose a novel

Leveraging recent results on regularized saddle-flow dynamics, we develop a
novel stochastic gradient descent-ascent algorithm whose trajectories converge
to the optimal policy almost surely.

fruitlets to measure their diameters. To measure growth rates, we utilize an
Attentional Graph Neural Network to associate fruitlets across different days.
We provide quantitative results on data collected in an apple orchard, and
demonstrate that our system is able to predict abscise rates within 3% of the

on the evolution of the cosmological complexity $\mathcal{C}_{FS}$ . We find
that when the thermal effect is considered, the Universe would ``decomplex""
firstly with the cosmic expansion after the mode of the scalar perturbations
exiting the horizon in the de Sitter (dS) phase and $\mathcal{C}_{FS}$ has a
minimum about $\pi/4$. If $\mathcal{C}_{FS}$ can reach its minimum during the
dS era, which requires a small $\kappa_0$ or a large e-folding number for a
large $\kappa_0$, it will bounce back to increase, and after the Universe
enters the radiation dominated (RD) phase from the dS one, $\mathcal{C}_{FS}$
will decrease, pass its minimum again, and then increase till the mode reenters
the horizon. For the case of a large enough $\kappa_0$, $\mathcal{C}_{FS}$
decreases but does not reach its minimum during the dS era, and it begins to
increase after the transition from the dS phase to the RD one. When the mode
reenters the horizon during the RD era, the cosmological complexity will
oscillate around about $\kappa_{0}$. These features are different from that of
the initial zero-temperature case, i.e., the cosmological complexity increases
during the dS phase and decreases in the RD era till the mode reenters the

primal-dual algorithms such as the alternating direction of method multipliers

of the primal-only FL algorithms. However, the reason behind remains a mystery
still. In this paper, we firstly reveal the fact that the federated ADMM is
essentially a client-variance-reduced algorithm. While this explains the
inherent robustness of federated ADMM, the vanilla version of it lacks the
ability to be adaptive to the degree of client heterogeneity. Besides, the
global model at the server under client sampling is biased which slows down the
practical convergence. To go beyond ADMM, we propose a novel primal-dual FL

variance-reduction level and biasness of the global model. In addition, FedVRA
unifies several representative FL algorithms in the sense that they are either
special instances of FedVRA or are close to it. Extensions of FedVRA to

intelligent transportation systems and data-driven decision-making processes.
To make an accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we
assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in traffic
time series. In the literature, substantial prior works have demonstrated the
effectiveness of utilizing low-rankness property of traffic data by
matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian
kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic
time series, which can be formulated in the form of circular convolution. Then,
we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by
putting the nuclear norm of a circulant matrix and the Laplacian temporal
regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that takes
a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in a relatively low time complexity.
Through extensive experiments on some traffic datasets, we demonstrate the
superiority of LCR for imputing traffic time series of various time series
behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity). The proposed LCR
model is an efficient and effective solution to large-scale traffic data
imputation over the existing baseline models. Despite the LCR's application to
time series data, the key modeling idea lies in bridging the low-rank models
and the Laplacian regularization through FFT, which is also applicable to image
inpainting. The adapted datasets and Python implementation are publicly
available at https://github.com/xinychen/transdim.

  concepts",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Inspired by a sample lesson, this paper studies and discusses children's
preferences in learning scientific concepts. In a ""Dissolution"" lesson, one of
the students took the demonstration experiment of ""carmine dissolves in Water""
demonstrated by the teacher as the prototype to judge whether a new phenomenon
belongs to dissolution, instead of analyzing and judging the phenomenon by
using the dissolution definition. Therefore, we propose a conjecture that
""prototype matching"" may be a more preferred way for children to learn concepts
than thinking through inquiry experiment, analysis, deduction, etc. To this
end, we conducted a targeted test on 160 fifth grade students (all of whom had
learned this lesson) from a primary school in Beijing, and used goodness of fit
test to statistically analyze the results. The results showed that: 1. the Chi
square of the general result is 73.865, P<0.001, indicating that children did
have obvious prototype preference; 2. We ""tampered"" some of the prototypes,
that is, they looked like the prototypes that the teacher had told students,
but they were actually wrong. However, the results showed that children still
preferred these so-called ""prototypes"" (chi square is 21.823, P<0.001).
Conclusion: 1. Children have an obvious preference for ""prototype matching"" in
scientific concept learning, which is not only obviously deviated from the
current general understanding of science education that emphasizes
discovery/inquiry construction, but also points out that there may be a
priority relationship among various ways of concept organization (such as
definition theory, prototype theory, schema theory, etc.). 2. Children's
preference for prototypes seems to be unthinking, and they will not identify
the authenticity of prototypes, which is particularly noteworthy in front-line
teaching.

networks have demonstrated great potential. However, depth maps predicted by
existing deep models usually lack fine-grained details due to the convolution
operations and the down-samplings in networks. We find that increasing input
resolution is helpful to preserve more local details while the estimation at
low resolution is more accurate globally. Therefore, we propose a novel depth
map fusion module to combine the advantages of estimations with
multi-resolution inputs. Instead of merging the low- and high-resolution
estimations equally, we adopt the core idea of Poisson fusion, trying to
implant the gradient domain of high-resolution depth into the low-resolution
depth. While classic Poisson fusion requires a fusion mask as supervision, we
propose a self-supervised framework based on guided image filtering. We
demonstrate that this gradient-based composition performs much better at noisy

lightweight depth fusion is one-shot and runs in real-time, making our method
80X faster than a state-of-the-art depth fusion method. Quantitative

the compute time overhead of private learning, we show that \emph{per-layer
clipping}, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped
separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation
in differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that
is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private
learning for many workflows of interest. While per-layer clipping with constant
thresholds tends to underperform standard flat clipping, per-layer clipping
with adaptive thresholds matches or outperforms flat clipping under given

result, the same rotation can be translated into different roll, pitch, and yaw

the commonalities among the brains exposed to the same stimuli for
inter-subject correlation analysis, we established response models for one
subject by averaging the fMRI signals across several other subjects, and then
detected AINSs of the subject using general linear model. We evaluated the
effectiveness of AINS with both statistical and predictive analyses on
individual differences in sex and intelligence quotient (IQ), based on the four
movie fMRI runs included in the Human Connectome Project dataset. The results
indicate that AINS is not only sensitive to sex- and IQ-related differences,
but also specific enough to decode individuals' sex and IQ. Specifically,
activations in brain regions associated with visual-spatial processing were
observed to be consistently stronger in the males, and individuals with higher
IQ exhibited consistently stronger activations in regions within the visual and
the default mode networks. Predictions of individuals' sex and IQ were
significantly better than those based on random labels (P < 0.005). Taken
together, AINS advanced in this study can be an effective evaluation of human
brain function. The conceptual simplicity and easy application of its detection
may make AINS a favorable choice for future brain function analyses and
personalized medicine based on naturalistic fMRI.

tokens at once in a non-autoregressive manner. Thus, we can easily trade off
the translation quality and speed by adjusting $k$. In addition, by integrating
other modeling techniques (e.g., sequence-level knowledge distillation and
deep-encoder-shallow-decoder layer allocation strategy) and a mass of
engineering efforts, HRT improves 80\% inference speed and achieves equivalent
translation performance with the same-capacity AT counterpart. Our fastest
system reaches 6k+ words/second on the GPU latency setting, estimated to be
about 3.1x faster than the last year's winner.

  Optimization","Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-23)",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D)
transforms a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) into a set of
single-objective subproblems for collaborative optimization. Mismatches between
subproblems and solutions can lead to severe performance degradation of MOEA/D.
Most existing mismatch coping strategies only work when the $L_{\infty}$
scalarization is used. A mismatch coping strategy that can use any $L_{p}$
scalarization, even when facing MOPs with non-convex Pareto fronts, is of great
significance for MOEA/D. This paper uses the global replacement (GR) as the
backbone. We analyze how GR can no longer avoid mismatches when $L_{\infty}$ is
replaced by another $L_{p}$ with $p\in [1,\infty)$, and find that the
$L_p$-based ($1\leq p<\infty$) subproblems having inconsistently large
preference regions. When $p$ is set to a small value, some middle subproblems
have very small preference regions so that their direction vectors cannot pass
through their corresponding preference regions. Therefore, we propose a
generalized $L_p$ (G$L_p$) scalarization to ensure that the subproblem's
direction vector passes through its preference region. Our theoretical analysis
shows that GR can always avoid mismatches when using the G$L_p$ scalarization
for any $p\geq 1$. The experimental studies on various MOPs conform to the
theoretical analysis.

the applications requiring both of them. Existing methods usually suffer from
some limitations, which rely on either both singing and speaking data from the
same person or cascaded models of multiple tasks. To address these problems, a
simplified elegant framework for TTS and SVS, named UniSyn, is proposed in this
paper. It is an end-to-end unified model that can make a voice speak and sing
with only singing or speaking data from this person. To be specific, a
multi-conditional variational autoencoder (MC-VAE), which constructs two
independent latent sub-spaces with the speaker- and style-related (i.e. speak
or sing) conditions for flexible control, is proposed in UniSyn. Moreover,
supervised guided-VAE and timbre perturbation with the Wasserstein distance
constraint are leveraged to further disentangle the speaker timbre and style.
Experiments conducted on two speakers and two singers demonstrate that UniSyn
can generate natural speaking and singing voice without corresponding training
data. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art end-to-end voice
generation work, which proves the effectiveness and advantages of UniSyn.

distributed in one compact structure and spatially associated with radio
continuum emission. Furthermore, nearly all the fitted components are likely
smaller than the beam size ($\sim$ 1.4""), which indicates that the broad OH
line profiles of these sources originated from one masing region or that more

including brightness temperature, spectral index, and q-index, show no
significant differences with the low-redshift OHM galaxies, which have
significantly lower OH line luminosities. Because these parameters are

indicate that the presence of radio AGN in the nuclei may not be essential for
the formation of OH emission. Over 1/3 of OHMs in this sample (6/17) show
possible variable features likely caused by interstellar scintillation due to

Subsequently, we leverage contrastive learning to maximize the similarity

manipulate imaging physical process and analyze network outputs, the relevance

appropriate imaging angles lead to more detailed structural and contour

presence of distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. Our work examines
how distribution shifts generated by common image corruptions affect the
accuracy/efficiency of MEMs. We find that under common corruptions,
early-exiting at the first correct exit reduces the inference cost and provides
a significant boost in accuracy ( 10%) over exiting at the last layer. However,
with realistic early-exit strategies, which do not assume knowledge about the
correct exits, MEMs still reduce inference cost but provide a marginal
improvement in accuracy (1%) compared to exiting at the last layer. Moreover,
the presence of distribution shift widens the gap between an MEM's maximum
classification accuracy and realistic early-exit strategies by 5% on average
compared with the gap on in-distribution data. Our empirical analysis shows
that the lack of calibration due to a distribution shift increases the
susceptibility of such early-exit strategies to exit early and increases
misclassification rates. Furthermore, the lack of calibration increases the
inconsistency in the predictions of the model across exits, leading to both
inefficient inference and more misclassifications compared with evaluation on
in-distribution data. Finally, we propose two metrics, underthinking and
overthinking, that quantify the different behavior of practical early-exit
strategy under distribution shifts, and provide insights into improving the
practical utility of MEMs.

of classic encryption schemes by enabling them to change their secret keys
significantly faster and more efficient. However, due to the reliance of PLKG
techniques on channel medium, reaching a high secret key rate is challenging in
static environments. Recently, exploiting intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)
as a means to induce randomness in static wireless channels has received
significant research interest. However, the impact of spatial correlation
between the IRS elements is rarely studied. To be specific, for the first time,
in this contribution, we take into account a spatially correlated IRS which
intends to enhance the secret key generation (SKG) rate in a static medium.
Closed form analytical expressions for SKG rate are derived for the two cases
of random phase shift and equal random phase shift for all the IRS elements. We
also analyze the temporal correlation between the channel samples to ensure the
randomness of the generated secret key sequence. We further formulate an
optimization problem in which we determine the optimal portion of time within a
coherence interval dedicated for the direct and indirect channel estimation. We
show the accuracy and the fast convergence of our proposed sequential convex
programming (SCP) based algorithm and discuss the various parameters affecting
spatially correlated IRS assisted PLKG.

transportation, supply chains, etc. Failures in MLCN can lead to major
disruptions in systems. Several research have focussed on different kinds of
failures, such as, cascades, their reasons and ways to avoid them. This paper
considers failures in a specific type of MLCN where the lower layer provides
services to the higher layer without cross layer interaction, typical of a
computer network. A three layer MLCN is constructed with the same set of nodes
where each layer has different characteristics, the bottom most layer is
Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph with shortest path hop count among the nodes as
gaussian, the middle layer is ER graph with higher number of edges from the
previous, and the top most layer is scale free graph with even higher number of
edges. Both edge and node failures are considered. Failures happen with
decreasing order of centralities of edges and nodes in static batch mode and
when the centralities change dynamically with progressive failures. Emergent
pattern of three key parameters, namely, average shortest path length (ASPL),
total shortest path count (TSPC) and total number of edges (TNE) for all the
three layers after node or edge failures are studied. Extensive simulations
show that all but one parameters show definite degrading patterns. Surprising,
ASPL for the middle layer starts showing a chaotic behavior beyond a certain
point for all types of failures.

high-level information contained in natural language is domain invariant to
different tracking domains. Based on this observation, we propose to introduce
natural language representation into visual MOT models for boosting the domain
generalization ability. However, it is infeasible to label every tracking
target with a textual description. To tackle this problem, we design two
modules, namely visual context prompting (VCP) and visual-language mixing
(VLM). Specifically, VCP generates visual prompts based on the input frames.
VLM joints the information in the generated visual prompts and the textual
prompts from a pre-defined Trackbook to obtain instance-level pseudo textual
description, which is domain invariant to different tracking scenes. Through
training models on MOT17 and validating them on MOT20, we observe that the
pseudo textual descriptions generated by our proposed modules improve the
generalization performance of query-based trackers by large margins.

R\'enyi entropies as specific examples. In particular, given a quantum oracle
that prepares an $n$-dimensional quantum state
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{p_{i}}|i\rangle$, for $\alpha>1$ and $0<\alpha<1$, our
algorithm framework estimates $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy $H_{\alpha}(p)$ to
within additive error $\epsilon$ with probability at least $2/3$ using
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1-\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon +
\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$ and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$

well as the joint dependence between $n$ and $1/\epsilon$. Technically, our
quantum algorithms combine quantum singular value transformation, quantum

present a new class of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms and give a

beyond Gaussian designs, in the sense that it recovers the existing Gaussian
AMP as a special case. Furthermore, ML-RI-GAMP exhibits a significantly lower
complexity than ML-VAMP, as the computationally intensive singular value
decomposition is replaced by an estimation of the moments of the design

at little to no cost in the performance of the algorithm.

problem in low-level computer vision. The natural image domain commonly relies
on supervised learning, e.g., a pre-trained VGG, to obtain a latent
representation. However, due to domain shift, pre-trained models from the
natural image domain might not apply to other image domains, such as medical
imaging. Notably, in medical imaging, evaluating the perceptual similarity is
exclusively performed by specialists trained extensively in diverse medical
fields. Thus, medical imaging remains devoid of task-specific, objective
perceptual measures. This work answers the question: Is it necessary to rely on
supervised learning to obtain an effective representation that could measure
perceptual similarity, or is self-supervision sufficient? To understand whether
recent contrastive self-supervised representation (CSR) may come to the rescue,
we start with natural images and systematically evaluate CSR as a metric across
numerous contemporary architectures and tasks and compare them with existing
methods. We find that in the natural image domain, CSR behaves on par with the
supervised one on several perceptual tests as a metric, and in the medical
domain, CSR better quantifies perceptual similarity concerning the experts'
ratings. We also demonstrate that CSR can significantly improve image quality
in two image synthesis tasks. Finally, our extensive results suggest that
perceptuality is an emergent property of CSR, which can be adapted to many
image domains without requiring annotations.

integrates the classical level-set evolution model into deep neural network
learning to achieve accurate mask prediction with only bounding box
supervision. Specifically, both the input image and its deep features are
employed to evolve the level-set curves implicitly, and a local consistency
module based on a pixel affinity kernel is used to mine the local context and
spatial relations. Two types of single-stage frameworks, i.e., CNN-based and
transformer-based frameworks, are developed to empower the level-set evolution
for box-supervised instance segmentation, and each framework consists of three
essential components: instance-aware decoder, box-level matching assignment and
level-set evolution. By minimizing the level-set energy function, the mask map
of each instance can be iteratively optimized within its bounding box
annotation. The experimental results on five challenging testbeds, covering
general scenes, remote sensing, medical and scene text images, demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our proposed Box2Mask approach for box-supervised

that correctly describe the categories of a given entity mention in a sentence.
Most recent works infer each entity type independently, ignoring the
correlations between types, e.g., when an entity is inferred as a president, it
should also be a politician and a leader. To this end, we use an undirected
graphical model called pairwise conditional random field (PCRF) to formulate
the UFET problem, in which the type variables are not only unarily influenced
by the input but also pairwisely relate to all the other type variables. We use
various modern backbones for entity typing to compute unary potentials, and
derive pairwise potentials from type phrase representations that both capture
prior semantic information and facilitate accelerated inference. We use
mean-field variational inference for efficient type inference on very large
type sets and unfold it as a neural network module to enable end-to-end
training. Experiments on UFET show that the Neural-PCRF consistently
outperforms its backbones with little cost and results in a competitive
performance against cross-encoder based SOTA while being thousands of times

1975, and as yet unresolved. This problem has relevance to diverse fields
ranging from combinatorics and algorithm analysis to coding theory and
computational biology. Using methods of statistical mechanics, as well as some
existing results on the combinatorial structure of LCS, we link constant
$\gamma$ to the parameters of a certain stochastic particle process. These
parameters are determined by a specific (large) system of polynomial equations
with integer coefficients, which implies that $\gamma$ is an algebraic number.
Short of finding an exact closed-form solution for such a polynomial system,
which appears to be unlikely, our approach essentially resolves the
Chv\'atal-Sankoff problem, albeit in a somewhat unexpected way with a rather
negative flavour.

index of refraction based on hybrid integration of multi-layered anisotropic

bias and transverse-electric (TE) polarization, the device exhibits a linear
resonance shift without any amplitude modulation. However, for the
transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization, both amplitude and phase modulation are
observed. The corresponding wavelength shift and half-wave voltage length
product (V_{\pi}.l) for the TE polarization are 1.78 pm/V and 0.9 V.cm,
respectively. These values are enhanced for the TM polarizations and correspond
to 6.65 pm/V and 0.28 V.cm, respectively. The dynamic radio frequency (RF)
response of the devices was also tested at different bias conditions.
Remarkably, the device exhibits a 1.6 MHz and 2.1 MHz response at 0 V and 7 V

  Our main result asserts that the weak rate, for a reasonably large class of

phenomena to identify the potential correlations between them. During the time
of analysis MESSENGER heliocentric distance varied between 0.31 and 0.47 au.
Results. There is an asymmetry to the east in the range of connection angles
(CAs) for which the SEE events present the highest peak intensities, where the
CA is the longitudinal separation between the footpoint of the magnetic field
connecting to the spacecraft and the flare location. Based on this asymmetry,
we define the subsample of well-connected events as when -65$^{\circ}\leq$ CA
$\leq+33^{\circ}$. Conclusions. Based on the comparison of the correlation
coefficients presented in this study using near 0.4 au data, (1) both flare and
shock-related processes may contribute to the acceleration of near relativistic
electrons in large SEE events, in agreement with previous studies based on near
1 au data; and (2) the maximum speed of the CME-driven shock is a better
parameter to investigate particle acceleration related mechanisms than the
average CME speed, as suggested by the stronger correlation with the SEE peak
intensities.

reducing tail states is the addition of alkali metals, the effect of which has
been associated with the passivation of charged defects at grain boundaries.
Herein, tail states in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 are revisited by studying the effect of
compositional variations and alkali incorporation into single crystals. The
results demonstrate that alkalis decrease the density of tail states despite
the absence of grain boundaries, suggesting that there is more to alkalis than

In this paper, we try to find the reason why autoregressive modeling does not

autoregressive image modeling (named SAIM) by the two simple designs. First, we

position, so that the encoder and decoder can reinforce each other. By
introducing stochastic prediction and the parallel encoder-decoder, SAIM
significantly improve the performance of autoregressive image modeling. Our
method achieves the best accuracy (83.9%) on the vanilla ViT-Base model among

practical applications. Previous work found that the probabilities assigned by
the generation model reflect its preferences for the generated summary,
including the preference for factual consistency, and the preference for the
language or knowledge prior as well. To separate the preference for factual
consistency, we propose an unsupervised framework named CoP by controlling the
preference of the generation model with the help of prompt. More specifically,
the framework performs an extra inference step in which a text prompt is
introduced as an additional input. In this way, another preference is described
by the generation probability of this extra inference process. The difference
between the above two preferences, i.e. the difference between the
probabilities, could be used as measurements for detecting factual

disease prognosis and prediction. To become accepted for use in clinical
applications, these tools have to be validated on external data. In practice,
validation is often hampered by logistical issues, resulting in multiple
small-sized validation studies. It is therefore necessary to synthesize the
results of these studies using techniques for meta-analysis. Here we consider
strategies for meta-analyzing the concordance probability for time-to-event

discriminatory power of prediction models with a right-censored outcome. We
show that standard meta-analysis of the C-index may lead to biased results, as
the magnitude of the concordance probability depends on the length of the time
interval used for evaluation (defined e.g. by the follow-up time, which might
differ considerably between studies). To address this issue, we propose a set
of methods for random-effects meta-regression that incorporate time directly as
covariate in the model equation. In addition to analyzing nonlinear time trends
via fractional polynomial, spline, and exponential decay models, we provide
recommendations on suitable transformations of the C-index before
meta-regression. Our results suggest that the C-index is best meta-analyzed
using fractional polynomial meta-regression with logit-transformed C-index
values. Classical random-effects meta-analysis (not considering time as

Specifically, DACOM introduces a component, TimeNet, that is responsible for
adjusting the waiting time of an agent to receive messages from other agents
such that the uncertainty associated with delay can be addressed. Our

their algorithm works only in the unweighted setting and they left it as an
open problem to give a parameterized approximation scheme in the weighted

  Our contribution is a partial answer to the open question of Grandoni et al.

n^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ time, where $\text{opt}_k$ is the maximum weight of a
solution of cardinality at most $k$. Note that thus, our algorithm may return a
solution consisting of more than $k$ rectangles. To complement this apparent
weakness, we also propose a parameterized approximation scheme with running
time $2^{O(k^2 \log(k/\epsilon))} n^{O(1)}$ that finds a solution with
cardinality at most $k$ and total weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\text{opt}_k$

to calculate the worst-case value function. However, it is non-trivial to
extend such methods to handle complex tasks, as finding the maximum over
large-scale action spaces is usually cumbersome. In this paper, we propose the
smoothing policy iteration (SPI) algorithm to solve the zero-sum MGs
approximately, where the maximum operator is replaced by the weighted LogSumExp
(WLSE) function to obtain the nearly optimal equilibrium policies. Specially,
the adversarial policy is served as the weight function to enable an efficient
sampling over action spaces.We also prove the convergence of SPI and analyze
its approximation error in $\infty -$norm based on the contraction mapping
theorem. Besides, we propose a model-based algorithm called Smooth adversarial
Actor-critic (SaAC) by extending SPI with the function approximations. The
target value related to WLSE function is evaluated by the sampled trajectories
and then mean square error is constructed to optimize the value function, and
the gradient-ascent-descent methods are adopted to optimize the protagonist and
adversarial policies jointly. In addition, we incorporate the
reparameterization technique in model-based gradient back-propagation to
prevent the gradient vanishing due to sampling from the stochastic policies. We
verify our algorithm in both tabular and function approximation settings.
Results show that SPI can approximate the worst-case value function with a high

(SR) methods have achieved impressive performance on bicubic kernel, which is
not valid to handle unknown degradations in real-world applications. Recent
blind SR methods suggest to reconstruct SR images relying on blur kernel
estimation. However, their results still remain visible artifacts and detail
distortion due to the estimation errors. To alleviate these problems, in this
paper, we propose an effective and kernel-free network, namely DSSR, which
enables recurrent detail-structure alternative optimization without blur kernel
prior incorporation for blind SR. Specifically, in our DSSR, a detail-structure
modulation module (DSMM) is built to exploit the interaction and collaboration
of image details and structures. The DSMM consists of two components: a detail
restoration unit (DRU) and a structure modulation unit (SMU). The former aims
at regressing the intermediate HR detail reconstruction from LR structural
contexts, and the latter performs structural contexts modulation conditioned on
the learned detail maps at both HR and LR spaces. Besides, we use the output of
DSMM as the hidden state and design our DSSR architecture from a recurrent
convolutional neural network (RCNN) view. In this way, the network can
alternatively optimize the image details and structural contexts, achieving
co-optimization across time. Moreover, equipped with the recurrent connection,
our DSSR allows low- and high-level feature representations complementary by
observing previous HR details and contexts at every unrolling time. Extensive
experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world images demonstrate that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art against existing methods. The source code

exhibited impressive success on known degraded low-resolution (LR) images.
However, this type of approach is hard to hold its performance in practical
scenarios when the degradation process is unknown. Despite existing blind SR
methods proposed to solve this problem using blur kernel estimation, the
perceptual quality and reconstruction accuracy are still unsatisfactory. In
this paper, we analyze the degradation of a high-resolution (HR) image from
image intrinsic components according to a degradation-based formulation model.
We propose a components decomposition and co-optimization network (CDCN) for
blind SR. Firstly, CDCN decomposes the input LR image into structure and detail
components in feature space. Then, the mutual collaboration block (MCB) is
presented to exploit the relationship between both two components. In this way,
the detail component can provide informative features to enrich the structural
context and the structure component can carry structural context for better
detail revealing via a mutual complementary manner. After that, we present a
degradation-driven learning strategy to jointly supervise the HR image detail
and structure restoration process. Finally, a multi-scale fusion module
followed by an upsampling layer is designed to fuse the structure and detail
features and perform SR reconstruction. Empowered by such degradation-based
components decomposition, collaboration, and mutual optimization, we can bridge
the correlation between component learning and degradation modelling for blind
SR, thereby producing SR results with more accurate textures. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic SR datasets and real-world images show that the
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods.

effect of wall proximity on the vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of an
elastically mounted circular cylinder having two degrees of freedom for gap
ratios g/D = {0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6}, where D is the cylinder diameter, and g
is the gap between the cylinder's bottom surface and the wall. Parametric
simulations have been performed using a quasi-monolithic coupled
fluid-structure interaction solver with exact interface tracking for Re = 100
and m*=10 over a range of U* to present the effect of the wall's proximity on
the vibration response, vortex structures, force dynamics, pressure
distribution, the phase between the hydrodynamic forces and displacements, and
finally different VIV branching response regimes. The numerical simulations
reveal that as the gap ratio reduces, the maximum transverse vibration
amplitude reduces, and the lock-in region widens. Periodic vortex shedding with
a single ""S"" vortex street has been observed for all gap ratios g/D = 0.1 to
0.6. It has also been observed that the wall proximity affects the mean lift
coefficient not only in the lock-in region but also in the pre and post lock-in
regions. In the lock-in region, the response dynamics of the vibrating cylinder
can be characterized into two branches, with the transition between the
branches marked by a sudden jump in the phase angle $\Phi$ between the lift and
transverse displacement from 0 to a value slightly greater than $\pi$. As the
gap ratio reduces, the widening of the lock-in region is accompanied by the
widening of the IInd response branch and a narrowing down of the Ist response
branch. For the gap ratio of g/D = 0.1, the Ist branch vanishes entirely. This
work is directly relevant to the design, maintenance, and fatigue life
estimation of underwater pipelines/cables laid on the seabed.

recent years, a number of online hashing methods have emerged, which can update
the hash functions to adapt to the new stream data and realize dynamic
retrieval. However, existing online hashing methods are required to update the
whole database with the latest hash functions when a query arrives, which leads
to low retrieval efficiency with the continuous increase of the stream data. On
the other hand, these methods ignore the supervision relationship among the
examples, especially in the multi-label case. In this paper, we propose a novel
Fast Online Hashing (FOH) method which only updates the binary codes of a small
part of the database. To be specific, we first build a query pool in which the
nearest neighbors of each central point are recorded. When a new query arrives,
only the binary codes of the corresponding potential neighbors are updated. In
addition, we create a similarity matrix which takes the multi-label supervision
information into account and bring in the multi-label projection loss to
further preserve the similarity among the multi-label data. The experimental
results on two common benchmarks show that the proposed FOH can achieve
dramatic superiority on query time up to 6.28 seconds less than
state-of-the-art baselines with competitive retrieval accuracy.

  Service: A Novel Hyper-Heuristic",,,"10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2023.107882",,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is the problem of finding a subsequence
among a set of strings that has two properties of being common to all and is
the longest. The LCS has applications in computational biology and text
editing, among many others. Due to the NP-hardness of the general longest
common subsequence, numerous heuristic algorithms and solvers have been
proposed to give the best possible solution for different sets of strings. None
of them has the best performance for all types of sets. In addition, there is
no method to specify the type of a given set of strings. Besides that, the
available hyper-heuristic is not efficient and fast enough to solve this
problem in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hyper-heuristic
to solve the longest common subsequence problem using a novel criterion to
classify a set of strings based on their similarity. To do this, we offer a
general stochastic framework to identify the type of a given set of strings.
Following that, we introduce the set similarity dichotomizer ($S^2D$) algorithm
based on the framework that divides the type of sets into two. This algorithm
is introduced for the first time in this paper and opens a new way to go beyond
the current LCS solvers. Then, we present a novel hyper-heuristic that exploits
the $S^2D$ and one of the internal properties of the set to choose the best
matching heuristic among a set of heuristics. We compare the results on
benchmark datasets with the best heuristics and hyper-heuristics. The results
show a higher performance of our proposed hyper-heuristic in both quality of
solutions and run time factors.

development of effective numerical methods and software. One of the most
utilized approaches for magnetoquasistatic simulations in applied
superconductivity is the $H$ formulation. However, due to the large number of
degrees of freedom (DOFs) present when modeling large and complex systems (e.g.
large coils for fusion applications, electrical machines, and medical
applications) using the standard $H$ formulation on a desktop machine becomes
infeasible. The $H$ formulation solves the Faraday's law formulated in terms of
the magnetic field intensity $\mathbf{H}$ using edge elements in the whole
modeling domain. For this reason, a very high resistivity is assumed for the
non-conducting domains, leading to an ill-conditioned system matrix and
therefore long computation times. In contrast, the $H$-$\phi$ formulation uses
the $H$ formulation in the conducting region, and the $\phi$ formulation
(magnetic scalar potential) in the surrounding non-conducting domains,
drastically reducing DOFs and computation time. In this work, we use the
$H$-$\phi$ formulation in 2D for the magnetothermal (AC losses and quench)
analysis of stacks of REBCO tapes. The same approach is extended to a 3D case
for the AC loss analysis of a twisted superconducting wire. All the results
obtained by simulations in Sparselizard are compared with results obtained with
COMSOL. Our custom tool allows us to distribute the simulations over hundreds
of CPUs using domain decomposition methods, considerably reducing the
simulation times without compromising accuracy.

general relationships. Then, we express the thermodynamic relationships of
Eckart's theory. Due to the basic equations of Eckart's theory and Friedmann's
equations, we consider two states, one is $p=-\rho$ (standard) and the other is
$p\neq-\rho$ (non-standard). In the standard state, we define the pressure
$(p)$, energy density $(\rho)$, and bulk viscosity coefficient $(\xi)$ of the
cosmic fluid in terms of cosmic time and we obtain its relations. We also
mention that in this standard state, because of $p=-\rho$, the value of $a(t)$
is zero, so $a(t)$ is not defined in this state. But in the non-standard case
$(p\neq-\rho)$ the bulk viscosity coefficient $(\xi)$ is zero and only the
scale factor and pressure and energy density of the cosmic fluid is defined. We
also consider two states of constant and variable bulk viscosity coefficients
and obtain three Hubble constant parameters and scale factors in terms of
cosmic time, and energy density in terms of the scale factor. In the state of
variable bulk viscosity coefficient, we consider the viscosity coefficient as
the power-law from energy density $(\xi=\alpha\rho^{s})$, which is $\alpha>0$

domain networks. An AD environment naturally describes an attack graph where
nodes represent computers/accounts/security groups, and edges represent
existing accesses/known exploits that allow the attacker to gain access from
one node to another. Motivated by practical AD use cases, we study a
Stackelberg game between one attacker and one defender. There are multiple
entry nodes for the attacker to choose from and there is a single target
(Domain Admin). Every edge has a failure rate. The attacker chooses the attack
path with the maximum success rate. The defender can block a limited number of
edges (i.e., revoke accesses) from a set of blockable edges, limited by budget.
The defender's aim is to minimize the attacker's success rate.
  We exploit the tree-likeness of practical AD graphs to design scalable
algorithms. We propose two novel methods that combine theoretical fixed
parameter analysis and practical optimisation techniques.
  For graphs with small tree widths, we propose a tree decomposition based
dynamic program. We then propose a general method for converting tree
decomposition based dynamic programs to reinforcement learning environments,
which leads to an anytime algorithm that scales better, but loses the
optimality guarantee.
  For graphs with small numbers of non-splitting paths (a parameter we invent
specifically for AD graphs), we propose a kernelization technique that
significantly downsizes the model, which is then solved via mixed-integer
programming.
  Experimentally, our algorithms scale to handle synthetic AD graphs with tens

of a manifold to the discrete world of graphs and other combinatorial
structures? This problem carries significant importance for analyzing models of
discrete spacetime in quantum gravity; inferring network geometry in network
science; and manifold learning in data science. The key contribution of this
paper is to introduce and validate a new estimator of discrete sectional
curvature for random graphs with low metric-distortion. The latter are
constructed via a specific graph sprinkling method on different manifolds with
constant sectional curvature. We define a notion of metric distortion, which
quantifies how well the graph metric approximates the metric of the underlying
manifold. We show how graph sprinkling algorithms can be refined to produce
hard annulus random geometric graphs with minimal metric distortion. We
construct random geometric graphs for spheres, hyperbolic and euclidean planes;
upon which we validate our curvature estimator. Numerical analysis reveals that
the error of the estimated curvature diminishes as the mean metric distortion
goes to zero, thus demonstrating convergence of the estimate. We also perform
comparisons to other existing discrete curvature measures. Finally, we
demonstrate two practical applications: (i) estimation of the earth's radius
using geographical data; and (ii) sectional curvature distributions of
self-similar fractals.

for prediction of next market index fluctuations. One important question in

can be effectively used by a semi-supervised GNN to predict index fluctuations.
In this paper, we introduce a framework called NETpred that generates a novel
heterogeneous graph representing multiple related indices and their stocks by
using several stock-stock and stock-index relation measures. It then thoroughly
selects a diverse set of representative nodes that cover different parts of the
state space and whose price movements are accurately predictable. By assigning
initial predicted labels to such a set of nodes, NETpred makes sure that the
subsequent GCN model can be successfully trained using a semi-supervised
learning process. The resulting model is then used to predict the stock labels
which are finally aggregated to infer the labels for all the index nodes in the
graph. Our comprehensive set of experiments shows that NETpred improves the
performance of the state-of-the-art baselines by 3%-5% in terms of F-score
measure on different well-known data sets.
