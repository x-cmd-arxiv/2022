Iron(II) porphyrin (FeP) represents a challenging problem for electronic
structure methods. While it is currently accepted that the ground state is a
triplet, multiconfigurational wavefunction-based methods predict a quintet, and
density functional approximations vary between triplet and quintet states,
leading to a prediction that highly depends on the features of the method
employed. The recently proposed Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) aims
to provide a balanced treatment between static and dynamic correlation, and
together with the previous Piris Natural Orbital Functionals (PNOFs), allowed
us to explore the importance of each type of correlation in the stability order
of the states of FeP with a method that conserves the spin of the system. It is
noteworthy that GNOF correlates all electrons in all available orbitals for a
given basis set; in the case of the FeP with a double zeta basis set as used in
this work; this means that GNOF can properly correlate 186 electrons in 465
orbitals, significantly increasing the sizes of systems amenable to
multiconfigurational treatment. Results show that PNOF5, PNOF7s and PNOF7
predict the quintet to have a lower energy than the triplet state; however, the
addition of dynamic correlation via second-order Moller-Plesset corrections
(NOF-MP2) turns the triplet state to be lower than the quintet state, a
prediction also reproduced by GNOF that incorporates much more dynamic
correlation than its predecessors.

Intermediate enTity-based Sparse Interpretable Representation Learning

TASEP - Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process - and its $q$-deformation,
the $q$-TASEP) remain integrable if we equip each particle with its own speed
parameter. In this work, we present intertwining relations between Markov
transition operators of particle systems which differ by a permutation of the
speed parameters. These relations generalize our previous works
(arXiv:1907.09155, arXiv:1912.06067), but here we employ a novel approach based
on the Yang-Baxter equation for the higher spin stochastic six vertex model.
Our intertwiners are Markov transition operators, which leads to interesting
probabilistic consequences.
  First, we obtain a new Lax-type differential equation for the Markov
transition semigroups of homogeneous, continuous-time versions of our particle
systems. Our Lax equation encodes the time evolution of multipoint observables
of the $q$-TASEP and TASEP in a unified way, which may be of interest for the
asymptotic analysis of multipoint observables of these systems.
  Second, we show that our intertwining relations lead to couplings between
probability measures on trajectories of particle systems which differ by a
permutation of the speed parameters. The conditional distribution for such a
coupling is realized as a ""rewriting history"" random walk which randomly
resamples the trajectory of a particle in a chamber determined by the
trajectories of the neighboring particles. As a byproduct, we construct a new
coupling for standard Poisson processes on the positive real half-line with
different rates.

kJ/mol) and energy effect (-55 kJ/mol) for the reaction in water appeared
surprisingly competitive in the context of the literature. We hypothesize that
the carbonaceous cathode deserves in-depth experimental research as a possible

results can be extrapolated to other nanoscale carbons and, more importantly,

of the form $y=q(x)$, $q(x)\in \mathbb{R}[x]$, $\text{deg } q\geq 3$, and
$yx^\ell=1$, $\ell\in \mathbb{N}\setminus\{1\}$. For even degree sequences the
solution based on the number of moment matrix extensions was first given by
Fialkow using the truncated Riesz-Haviland theorem and a sum-of-squares
representations for polynomials, strictly positive on such curves. Namely, the
upper bound on this number is quadratic in the degrees of the sequence and the
polynomial determining a curve. We use a reduction to the univariate setting
technique and improve Fialkow's bound to $\text{deg }q-1$ (resp. $\ell+1$) for
curves $y=q(x)$ (resp. $yx^\ell=1$). This in turn gives analogous improvements
of the degrees in the sum-of-squares representations referred to above.
Moreover, we get the upper bounds on the number of atoms in the minimal
representing measure, which are $k\;\text{deg }q$ (resp. $k(\ell+1)$) for
curves $y=q(x)$ (resp. $yx^\ell=1$) for even degree sequences, while for odd
ones they are $k\;\text{deg }q-\big\lceil\frac{\text{deg }q}{2} \big\rceil$
(resp. $k(\ell+1)-\big\lfloor\frac{\ell}{2} \big\rfloor+1$) for curves $y=q(x)$

Riener and Schweighofer, which gives the same bound for odd degree sequences on
all plane curves, while in the odd case it is a slight improvement of their
bound in these special cases. Further on, we give another solution to the TMP
on the curves studied based on the feasibility of a linear matrix inequality,
corresponding to the univariate sequence obtained, and finally we solve
concretely odd degree cases of the TMP on curves $y=x^\ell$, $\ell=2,3$, and
add a new solvability condition to the even degree case on the curve $y=x^2$.

informative while satisfying metric properties. We then devise a simple
$O(N^2)$ dynamic programming algorithm to compute it on the interval and an
$O(N^3)$ algorithm to compute it on the circle. Surprisingly, we accomplish
this by ignoring all of the hierarchical information of the merge tree and
simply focusing on a sequence of ordered critical points, which can be
interpreted as a time series. Thus our algorithm is more similar to string edit
distance and dynamic time warping than it is to more conventional merge tree
comparison algorithms. In the context of time series with the interval as a
domain, we show empirically on the UCR time series classification dataset that
DOPE performs better than bottleneck/Wasserstein distances between persistence
diagrams.

most fundamental property of non-Abelian statistics is yet to be detected.
Moreover, the minimal Kitaev chain is qualitatively different from topological
superconductors in that it supports Majoranas only at a sweet spot. Therefore
it is not obvious whether non-Abelian characteristics such as braiding and
fusion can be demonstrated in this platform with a reasonable level of
robustness. In this work, we theoretically propose a protocol for detecting the
Majorana fusion rules in an artificial Kitaev chain consisting of four quantum

strongly influence the properties of neural population coding. However, how
such correlated neural fluctuations may arise from the intrinsic neural circuit
dynamics and subsequently impact the computational properties of neural
population activity remains poorly understood. The main difficulty lies in
resolving the nonlinear coupling between correlated fluctuations with the
overall dynamics of the system. In this study, we develop a neural circuit
model that captures the nonlinear noise coupling of realistic neurons to
investigate the dynamics of bump attractors, a type of spatially localized
persistent states implicated in a host of cognitive processes in the brain. We
show that a rich repertoire of spatial correlation patterns naturally emerge
from the intrinsic dynamics of the neural circuit model and further reveal how
the interplay between differential and noise correlations influences the
accuracy of neural population codes of bump attractors under different
dynamical regimes. Moreover, we find that negative correlations may induce
stable bound states between two bumps, a phenomenon previously unobserved in
firing rate models. These noise-induced effects of bump attractors lead to a
number of computational advantages including enhanced working memory capacity
and efficient codes through spatiotemporal multiplexing, and can account for a
range of cognitive and behavioral phenomena related to working memory. This
study offers a dynamical approach to investigating realistic correlated neural

''diagonalized''. This parameter was introduced by Strassen to study fast
matrix multiplication algorithms in algebraic complexity theory and is closely
related to many central tensor parameters (e.g. slice rank, partition rank,
analytic rank, geometric rank, G-stable rank) and problems in combinatorics,
computer science and quantum information theory. Strassen (J. Reine Angew.
Math., 1988) proved that there is a gap in the subrank when taking large powers
under the tensor product: either the subrank of all powers is at most one, or
it grows as a power of a constant strictly larger than one. In this paper, we
precisely determine this constant for tensors of any order. Additionally, for
tensors of order three, we prove that there is a second gap in the possible
rates of growth. Our results strengthen the recent work of Costa and Dalai (J.
Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 2021), who proved a similar gap for the slice rank. Our
theorem on the subrank has wider applications by implying such gaps not only
for the slice rank, but for any ``normalized monotone''. In order to prove the
main result, we characterize when a tensor has a very structured tensor (the
W-tensor) in its orbit closure. Our methods include degenerations in
Grassmanians, which may be of independent interest.

limitation, we newly introduce an FBG-based length sensor by leveraging a rigid
curved channel, through which FBGs are allowed to slide within the robot
following its body extension/compression, hence we can search and match the
FBGs with specific constant curvature in the fiber to determine the effective
length. From the fusion with the above measurements, a model-free filtering
technique is accordingly presented for simultaneous calibration of a
variable-length model and temporally continuous length estimation of the robot,
enabling its accurate shape sensing using solely FBGs. The performances of the

often used to argue that LMs are incapable of modeling goal-directed aspects of
human language production and comprehension. Can LMs trained on text learn
anything at all about the relationship between language and use? I argue that
LMs are models of intentional communication in a specific, narrow sense. When
performing next word prediction given a textual context, an LM can infer and
represent properties of an agent likely to have produced that context. These
representations can in turn influence subsequent LM generation in the same way
that agents' communicative intentions influence their language. I survey
findings from the recent literature showing that -- even in today's non-robust
and error-prone models -- LMs infer and use representations of fine-grained
communicative intentions and more abstract beliefs and goals. Despite the
limited nature of their training data, they can thus serve as building blocks
for systems that communicate and act intentionally.

varies in each step. The DCS spectrum is recorded in each stage, and a
multi-dimensional spectrum is generated from which the system time evolution is

to the coherent accumulation of population. Rabi oscillations are also observed

may suffer from overfitting. Overfitted models have been shown to be
susceptible to query-based attacks such as membership inference attacks (MIAs).
MIAs aim to determine whether a sample belongs to the dataset used to train a
classifier (members) or not (nonmembers). Recently, a new class of label based
MIAs (LAB MIAs) was proposed, where an adversary was only required to have
knowledge of predicted labels of samples. Developing a defense against an
adversary carrying out a LAB MIA on DNN models that cannot be retrained remains
an open problem. We present LDL, a light weight defense against LAB MIAs. LDL
works by constructing a high-dimensional sphere around queried samples such
that the model decision is unchanged for (noisy) variants of the sample within
the sphere. This sphere of label-invariance creates ambiguity and prevents a
querying adversary from correctly determining whether a sample is a member or a
nonmember. We analytically characterize the success rate of an adversary
carrying out a LAB MIA when LDL is deployed, and show that the formulation is
consistent with experimental observations. We evaluate LDL on seven datasets --
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB, Face, Purchase, Location, and Texas -- with varying
sizes of training data. All of these datasets have been used by SOTA LAB MIAs.
Our experiments demonstrate that LDL reduces the success rate of an adversary
carrying out a LAB MIA in each case. We empirically compare LDL with defenses
against LAB MIAs that require retraining of DNN models, and show that LDL
performs favorably despite not needing to retrain the DNNs.

However, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on

environmental friendliness of such AI methods at scale. Consequently, energy
efficiency plays an important role for AI model developers and infrastructure

the power draw of AI workflows on different types of compute nodes is key to
algorithmic improvements and the design of future compute clusters and

runtime is not accurate, but the consumption of the compute node needs to be
considered regarding its composition; 2. neglecting accelerator hardware on
mixed nodes results in overproportional inefficiency regarding energy
consumption; 3. energy consumption of model training and inference should be
considered separately - while training on GPUs outperforms all other node types

comparably efficient. One advantage of our approach is that the information on

classical theory of Legendre polynomials. As an easy consequence we obtain a
unified proof of P\'{o}lya's theorem. By showing that the relevant generating
functions are $\Delta$-analytic, we use the deeper Tauberian theory of

necessitate expert label curation, while unlabelled image data might be
relatively abundant. Active learning methods aim to prioritise a subset of
available image data for expert annotation, for label-efficient model training.
We develop a controller neural network that measures priority of images in a
sequence of batches, as in batch-mode active learning, for multi-class
segmentation tasks. The controller is optimised by rewarding positive
task-specific performance gain, within a Markov decision process (MDP)
environment that also optimises the task predictor. In this work, the task
predictor is a segmentation network. A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is
proposed with multiple MDPs, such that the pre-trained controller can be
adapted to a new MDP that contains data from different institutes and/or
requires segmentation of different organs or structures within the abdomen. We
present experimental results using multiple CT datasets from more than one
thousand patients, with segmentation tasks of nine different abdominal organs,
to demonstrate the efficacy of the learnt prioritisation controller function
and its cross-institute and cross-organ adaptability. We show that the proposed
adaptable prioritisation metric yields converging segmentation accuracy for the
novel class of kidney, unseen in training, using between approximately 40\% to
60\% of labels otherwise required with other heuristic or random prioritisation
metrics. For clinical datasets of limited size, the proposed adaptable
prioritisation offers a performance improvement of 22.6\% and 10.2\% in Dice
score, for tasks of kidney and liver vessel segmentation, respectively,
compared to random prioritisation and alternative active sampling strategies.

investigated by spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient analysis. In the
present numerical study, a constant isolator section with a cavity front wall
was considered, followed by a diffuser section simulated at Mach number 2.2
with three different back pressure ratios. The change in back pressure provides
three different conditions. To understand the unsteady dynamics of the
interaction of the shear layer with the shock train, the spatiotemporal
trajectory of the wall pressure and the centerline pressure distribution, the
spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient, and the modal analysis by dynamic
mode decomposition are obtained. The results show that the low-frequency shock
train oscillation dominates the cavity oscillation. The spatiotemporal

the propagation of local disturbances originating from the separated boundary
layer caused by the shock and the recirculation zone in the corners of the

considerations in mind. To address this problem, we propose a framework for
evaluating fairness in contextual resource allocation systems that is inspired
by fairness metrics in machine learning. This framework can be applied to
evaluate the fairness properties of a historical policy, as well as to impose
constraints in the design of new (counterfactual) allocation policies. Our work
culminates with a set of incompatibility results that investigate the interplay
between the different fairness metrics we propose. Notably, we demonstrate
that: 1) fairness in allocation and fairness in outcomes are usually
incompatible; 2) policies that prioritize based on a vulnerability score will
usually result in unequal outcomes across groups, even if the score is
perfectly calibrated; 3) policies using contextual information beyond what is
needed to characterize baseline risk and treatment effects can be fairer in
their outcomes than those using just baseline risk and treatment effects; and
4) policies using group status in addition to baseline risk and treatment
effects are as fair as possible given all available information. Our framework
can help guide the discussion among stakeholders in deciding which fairness
metrics to impose when allocating scarce resources.

  Coverage",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Terahertz (THz) communication can provide high-capacity data transmissions
benefiting from the ultra-broad bandwidth, but suffers from severe propagation
loss and line-of-sight (LoS) blockage that limits the network coverage. To
compensate for the loss, narrow beams are required. But they in turn bring in
THz narrow beam alignment challenges in mobile networks, resulting in poor link
connection and severe latency that degrades the network performance. This paper
exploits integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology to reduce the
THz beam misalignment caused by LoS blockage and user mobility. In line with
the 5G-specified beam management, we propose a joint reference signal (RS) and
the synchronization signal block (SSB)-based sensing scheme to predict the need
for beam switches, and signalling in advance to prevent beam misalignment,
named the joint SSB and RS-based sensing (JSRS) scheme. By reducing the impact
of imperfect sensing, we further provide a time-frequency sensing resource
allocation scheme that minimizes the beam misalignment probability. Considering
the sensing trade-offs and THz features, we provide stochastic geometry-based
expressions for coverage probability and network throughput, revealing design
insights into ISAC-THz network deployment and resource allocation. In urban use
cases tested, numerical results show that the JSRS scheme averagely reduces 80%
probability of beam misalignment, and enhances the coverage probability by
about 75%, compared to the network with 5G-required positioning ability.
Despite the imperfect sensing accuracy, JSRS scheme can achieve comparable
performance to that of the ideal-sensing case. By exploiting the angular
perception ability of directional beams, JSRS scheme helps mitigate the
challenge of narrow beam management to enhance the network coverage and
throughput, showing the great potential of ISAC-aided THz communication.

penalizing inter-depth quantum state differences, respectively. Furthermore, we
optimize the superposition coding power allocation by deriving and minimizing
the convergence bound of eSQFL. In an image classification task, extensive

Most of the existing methods rely on a multiple instance learning framework

limitation is evident in the application stage as the heavy computation for
extracting patch-level features is inevitable. In this paper, we develop
RLogist, a benchmarking deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for fast

of metastases in WSIs of lymph node sections, and subtyping of lung cancer.
Experimental results demonstrate that RLogist achieves competitive
classification performance compared to typical multiple instance learning

communication of non-IID data, and the limited scalability on the tasks and
edge devices. In this paper, we propose FedKNOW, an accurate and scalable
federated continual learning framework, via a novel concept of signature task
knowledge. FedKNOW is a client side solution that continuously extracts and
integrates the knowledge of signature tasks which are highly influenced by the

for a new task, the gradient integrator ensures the prevention of catastrophic

Specifically, we use a pre-trained language model to extract the most uncertain

grounding knowledge consists of keywords extracted from the response. For the
latter, the grounding knowledge is additionally augmented with keywords

the pursuit of constructing channels with optimal performance in information
transmission and representation. While considerable efforts are concentrated on
realizing optimal channel properties during network optimization, we study a
frequently overlooked possibility that neural networks can be initialized
toward optimal channels. Our theory, consistent with experimental validation,
identifies primary mechanics underlying this unknown possibility and suggests
intrinsic connections between statistical physics and deep learning. Unlike the
conventional theories that characterize neural networks applying the classic
mean-filed approximation, we offer analytic proof that this extensively applied
simplification scheme is not valid in studying neural networks as information
channels. To fill this gap, we develop a corrected mean-field framework
applicable for characterizing the limiting behaviors of information propagation
in neural networks without strong assumptions on inputs. Based on it, we
propose an analytic theory to prove that mutual information maximization is
realized between inputs and propagated signals when neural networks are
initialized at dynamic isometry, a case where information transmits via
norm-preserving mappings. These theoretical predictions are validated by
experiments on real neural networks, suggesting the robustness of our theory
against finite-size effects. Finally, we analyze our findings with information
bottleneck theory to confirm the precise relations among dynamic isometry,
mutual information maximization, and optimal channel properties in deep

permutation of the same multiset of symbols. Two frequency squares $F_1$ and
$F_2$ with symbol multisets $M_1$ and $M_2$ are \emph{orthogonal} if the
multiset of pairs obtained by superimposing $F_1$ and $F_2$ is $M_1\times M_2$.
A set of MOFS is a set of frequency squares in which each pair is orthogonal.
We first generalise the classical bound on the cardinality of a set of MOFS to
cover the case of \emph{mixed type}, meaning that the symbol multisets are
allowed to vary between the squares in the set.
  A frequency square is \emph{binary} if it only uses the symbols 0 and 1. We
say that a set $\mathcal{F}$ of MOFS is \emph{type-maximal} if it cannot be
extended to a larger set of MOFS by adding a square whose symbol multiset
matches that of at least one square already in $\mathcal{F}$. Building on
pioneering work by Stinson, several recent papers have found conditions that
are sufficient to show that a set of binary MOFS is type-maximal. We generalise
these papers in several directions, finding new conditions that imply
type-maximality. Our results cover sets of binary frequency squares of mixed
type. Also, where previous papers used parity arguments, we show the merit of
arguments that use moduli greater than 2.

gives a probabilistic threshold rule. Unlike the deterministic threshold model,
the spreading process is generally non-monotonic as the inferred distribution

we try to better understand how such models, specifically mT5, transfer *any*
linguistic and semantic knowledge across languages, even though no explicit
cross-lingual signals are provided during pre-training. Rather, only
unannotated texts from each language are presented to the model separately and
independently of one another, and the model appears to implicitly learn
cross-lingual connections. This raises several questions that motivate our
study, such as: Are the cross-lingual connections between every language pair
equally strong? What properties of source and target language impact the
strength of cross-lingual transfer? Can we quantify the impact of those
properties on the cross-lingual transfer?
  In our investigation, we analyze a pre-trained mT5 to discover the attributes
of cross-lingual connections learned by the model. Through a statistical
interpretation framework over 90 language pairs across three tasks, we show
that transfer performance can be modeled by a few linguistic and data-derived
features. These observations enable us to interpret cross-lingual understanding
of the mT5 model. Through these observations, one can favorably choose the best
source language for a task, and can anticipate its training data demands. A key
finding of this work is that similarity of syntax, morphology and phonology are
good predictors of cross-lingual transfer, significantly more than just the
lexical similarity of languages. For a given language, we are able to predict
zero-shot performance, that increases on a logarithmic scale with the number of
few-shot target language data points.

pre-training of the model in simulation, and then transfer the learned model to

boundaries from our designed synthetic images and labels without introducing
any extra auxiliary data. The synthetic image creates boundary information by
inserting synthetic concave regions that simulate the real concave regions of
salient objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-consistent framework that
consists of a global integral branch (GIB) and a boundary-aware branch (BAB) to
train a saliency detector. GIB aims to identify integral salient objects, whose
input is the original image. BAB aims to help predict accurate boundaries,
whose input is the synthetic image. These two branches are connected through a
self-consistent loss to guide the saliency detector to predict precise
boundaries while identifying salient objects. Experimental results on five
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly
supervised SOD methods and further narrows the gap with the fully supervised
methods.

between two quantum states using a two-outcome positive operator-valued measure
(POVM). Two types of decision errors in a QHT can occur. In this paper we focus
on the asymmetric setting of QHT, where the two types of decision errors are
treated unequally, considering the operational limitations arising from the
lack of a reference frame for chirality. This reference frame is associated
with the group $\bbZ_2$ consisting of the identity transformation and the
parity transformation. Thus, we have to discriminate between two qubit states
by performing the $\bbZ_2$-invariant POVMs only. We start from the
discrimination between two pure states. By solving the specific optimization
problem we completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of the minimal
probability of type-II error which occurs when the null hypothesis is accepted
when it is false. Our results reveal that the minimal probability reduces to
zero in a finite number of copies, if the $\bbZ_2$-twirlings of such two pure
states are different. We further derive the critical number of copies such that
the minimal probability reduces to zero. Finally, we replace one of the two
pure states with a maximally mixed state, and similarly characterize the
asymptotic behavior of the minimal probability of type-II error.

propose a new method to address such dynamic object movements through monocular
3D object detection. Specifically, we first detect 3D objects in the images and
build the per-pixel correspondence of the dynamic pixels with the detected

detected as cuboids with absolute scale, which is used to eliminate the scale

objects described by a natural language sentence. Previous works learn to
straightforwardly align the sentence embedding and pixel-level embedding for
highlighting the referred objects, but ignore the semantic consistency of
pixels within the same object, leading to incomplete masks and localization
errors in predictions. To tackle this problem, we propose CoupAlign, a simple
yet effective multi-level visual-semantic alignment method, to couple
sentence-mask alignment with word-pixel alignment to enforce object mask
constraint for achieving more accurate localization and segmentation.
Specifically, the Word-Pixel Alignment (WPA) module performs early fusion of
linguistic and pixel-level features in intermediate layers of the vision and
language encoders. Based on the word-pixel aligned embedding, a set of mask
proposals are generated to hypothesize possible objects. Then in the
Sentence-Mask Alignment (SMA) module, the masks are weighted by the sentence
embedding to localize the referred object, and finally projected back to
aggregate the pixels for the target. To further enhance the learning of the two
alignment modules, an auxiliary loss is designed to contrast the foreground and
background pixels. By hierarchically aligning pixels and masks with linguistic
features, our CoupAlign captures the pixel coherence at both visual and
semantic levels, thus generating more accurate predictions. Extensive
experiments on popular datasets (e.g., RefCOCO and G-Ref) show that our method
achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., about 2%
oIoU increase on the validation and testing set of RefCOCO. Especially,

Living systems are driven out-of-equilibrium at the microscopic level of

dissipation, or the entropy production rate (EPR), sets thermodynamic
constraints on cellular processes. Practically, calculating the total EPR in
experimental systems is challenging due to the limited spatiotemporal
resolution and the lack of complete information on every degree of freedom.
Here, we propose a new inference approach for a tight lower bound on the total

bounds relying on the first- and second-order transitions, and the moments of
the observed waiting time distributions, and apply our approach to two generic

a simple variant of this system, wherein the switch has infinite memory and the

deblurring, formulated as an image-conditioned generation process that maps
Gaussian noise to the high-quality image, conditioned on the blurry input.
Image-conditioned DPMs (icDPMs) have shown more realistic results than
regression-based methods when trained on pairwise in-domain data. However,
their robustness in restoring images is unclear when presented with
out-of-domain images as they do not impose specific degradation models or
intermediate constraints. To this end, we introduce a simple yet effective
multiscale structure guidance as an implicit bias that informs the icDPM about
the coarse structure of the sharp image at the intermediate layers. This guided
formulation leads to a significant improvement of the deblurring results,
particularly on unseen domain. The guidance is extracted from the latent space
of a regression network trained to predict the clean-sharp target at multiple
lower resolutions, thus maintaining the most salient sharp structures. With
both the blurry input and multiscale guidance, the icDPM model can better
understand the blur and recover the clean image. We evaluate a single-dataset
trained model on diverse datasets and demonstrate more robust deblurring
results with fewer artifacts on unseen data. Our method outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality while keeping

inspection and can be powered by image-based automation to expedite the process
and reduce labor costs. Pavement images are often in high-resolution with a low
ratio of distressed to non-distressed areas. Advanced approaches leverage these
properties via dividing images into patches and explore discriminative features
in the scale space. However, these approaches usually suffer from information
loss during image resizing and low efficiency due to complex learning
frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method for PDR. A
light network named the Kernel Inversed Pyramidal Resizing Network (KIPRN) is
introduced for image resizing, and can be flexibly plugged into the image
classification network as a pre-network to exploit resolution and scale
information. In KIPRN, pyramidal convolution and kernel inversed convolution
are specifically designed to mine discriminative information across different
feature granularities and scales. The mined information is passed along to the
resized images to yield an informative image pyramid to assist the image
classification network for PDR. We applied our method to three well-known
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and conducted an evaluation on a
large-scale pavement image dataset named CQU-BPDD. Extensive results
demonstrate that KIPRN can generally improve the pavement distress recognition
of these CNN models and show that the simple combination of KIPRN and

learning, owning to its exponential growth volume. Compared with the flat
Euclidean space, the curved hyperbolic space is far more ambient and
embeddable, particularly for datasets with implicit tree-like architectures,
such as hierarchies and power-law distributions. On the other hand, the
structure of a real-world network is usually intricate, with some regions being
tree-like, some being flat, and others being circular. Directly embedding
heterogeneous structural networks into a homogeneous embedding space
unavoidably brings inductive biases and distortions. Inspiringly, the discrete
curvature can well describe the local structure of a node and its surroundings,
which motivates us to investigate the information conveyed by the network
topology explicitly in improving geometric learning. To this end, we explore
the properties of the local discrete curvature of graph topology and the
continuous global curvature of embedding space. Besides, a Hyperbolic
Curvature-aware Graph Neural Network, HCGNN, is further proposed. In
particular, HCGNN utilizes the discrete curvature to lead message passing of
the surroundings and adaptively adjust the continuous curvature simultaneously.
Extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks show
that the proposed method outperforms various competitive models by a large
margin in both high and low hyperbolic graph data. Case studies further
illustrate the efficacy of discrete curvature in finding local clusters and
alleviating the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry.

produce smooth cycles of weaker strength and occasional grand minima. In
general, the number of the grand minima increases with the decrease in rotation
rate. These results can be explained by the fact that with the increase of
rotation period, the supercriticality of the dynamo decreases, and the dynamo
is more prone to produce extended grand minima in this regime.

destruction within countries that encompass the Mediterranean Basin. Recent
worrying trends in wildfire activity (i.e., occurrence and spread) suggest that
wildfires are likely to be highly impacted by climate change. In order to
facilitate appropriate risk mitigation, we must identify the main drivers of
extreme wildfires and assess their spatio-temporal trends, with a view to
understanding the impacts of global warming on fire activity. We analyse the
monthly burnt area due to wildfires over a region encompassing most of Europe
and the Mediterranean Basin from 2001 to 2020, and identify high fire activity
during this period in Algeria, Italy and Portugal. We build an extreme quantile
regression model with a high-dimensional predictor set describing
meteorological conditions, land cover usage, and orography. To model the
complex relationships between the predictor variables and wildfires, we use a
hybrid statistical deep-learning framework that can disentangle the effects of
vapour-pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature, and drought on wildfire
activity. Our results highlight that whilst VPD, air temperature, and drought
significantly affect wildfire occurrence, only VPD affects wildfire spread. To
gain insights into the effect of climate trends on wildfires in the near
future, we focus on August 2001 and perturb temperature according to its
observed trends (median over Europe: +0.04K per year). We find that, on average
over Europe, these trends lead to a relative increase of 17.1\% and 1.6\% in
the expected frequency and severity, respectively, of wildfires in August 2001,

  September 4, 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial attacks can easily fool object recognition systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs). Although many defense methods have been proposed in
recent years, most of them can still be adaptively evaded. One reason for the
weak adversarial robustness may be that DNNs are only supervised by category
labels and do not have part-based inductive bias like the recognition process
of humans. Inspired by a well-known theory in cognitive psychology --
recognition-by-components, we propose a novel object recognition model ROCK
(Recognizing Object by Components with human prior Knowledge). It first
segments parts of objects from images, then scores part segmentation results
with predefined human prior knowledge, and finally outputs prediction based on
the scores. The first stage of ROCK corresponds to the process of decomposing
objects into parts in human vision. The second stage corresponds to the
decision process of the human brain. ROCK shows better robustness than
classical recognition models across various attack settings. These results
encourage researchers to rethink the rationality of currently widely-used
DNN-based object recognition models and explore the potential of part-based
models, once important but recently ignored, for improving robustness.

Recent studies address this problem by employing additional recurrent or
attention layers that increase computational complexity. In this work, we
propose Axial-LOB, a novel fully-attentional deep learning architecture for
predicting price movements of stocks from LOB data. By utilizing gated
position-sensitive axial attention layers our architecture is able to construct
feature maps that incorporate global interactions, while significantly reducing
the size of the parameter space. Unlike previous works, Axial-LOB does not rely
on hand-crafted convolutional kernels and hence has stable performance under
input permutations and the capacity to incorporate additional LOB features. The
effectiveness of Axial-LOB is demonstrated on a large benchmark dataset,
containing time series representations of millions of high-frequency trading

excellent directional classification performance at all tested prediction

ideas from fractals, this paper is devoted to developing correlation dimension
analysis method for generalized geographical space by means of mathematical

statistical distance, we can construct a generalized correlation function. If
the relationship between correlation function and correlation lengths follows a

topology of a single graph when signals from all nodes are available. However,
many contemporary setups involve multiple related networks and, moreover, it is
often the case that only a subset of nodes is observed while the rest remain
hidden. Motivated by this, we propose a joint graph learning method that takes
into account the presence of hidden (latent) variables. Intuitively, the
presence of the hidden nodes renders the inference task ill-posed and
challenging to solve, so we overcome this detrimental influence by harnessing
the similarity of the estimated graphs. To that end, we assume that the
observed signals are drawn from a Gaussian Markov random field with latent
variables and we carefully model the graph similarity among hidden (latent)
nodes. Then, we exploit the structure resulting from the previous
considerations to propose a convex optimization problem that solves the joint
graph learning task by providing a regularized maximum likelihood estimator.

evaluate its performance over synthetic and real-world graphs.

Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology is used.
Our embedded active site approach demonstrates novel QMC. The rate-limiting

C-H bond stretch. The full dissociation energy is offset by Ni-H bond formation

with one atom dissociated from the methyl radical and the other desorbed from

modality, multimodal MRI data provide complementary tissue features that can be
exploited by deep learning models, resulting in better segmentation results.
However, multimodal mouse brain MRI data is often lacking, making automatic
segmentation of mouse brain fine structure a very challenging task. To address
this issue, it is necessary to fuse multimodal MRI data to produce
distinguished contrasts in different brain structures. Hence, we propose a
novel disentangled and contrastive GAN-based framework, named MouseGAN++, to
synthesize multiple MR modalities from single ones in a structure-preserving
manner, thus improving the segmentation performance by imputing missing
modalities and multi-modality fusion. Our results demonstrate that the
translation performance of our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Using the subsequently learned modality-invariant information as well as the
modality-translated images, MouseGAN++ can segment fine brain structures with
averaged dice coefficients of 90.0% (T2w) and 87.9% (T1w), respectively,
achieving around +10% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art

synthesis and segmentation method, can be used to fuse cross-modality
information in an unpaired manner and yield more robust performance in the
absence of multimodal data. We release our method as a mouse brain structural

`invertible-parameter' cases of the Temperley-Lieb and Brauer results of

Sroka's theorem that the homology of an odd-strand Temperley-Lieb algebra
vanishes, as well as an analogous result for Brauer algebras and an
interpretation of both results in the even-strand case. Our proofs are
relatively elementary: in particular, no auxiliary chain complexes or spectral

fundamentals of quantum theory, but also is considered as a crucial resource in
quantum information science. The generation of macroscopic entanglement
involving multiple optical and mechanical modes is a desired task in cavity
optomechanics. However, the dark-mode effect is a critical obstacle against the
generation of quantum entanglement in multimode optomechanical systems
consisting of multiple degenerate or near-degenerate mechanical modes coupled
to a common cavity mode. Here we propose an auxiliary-cavity-mode method to
enhance optomechanical entanglement in a multimode optomechanical system by
breaking the dark-mode effect. We find that the introduction of the auxiliary
cavity mode not only assists the entanglement creation between the cavity mode
and the mechanical modes, but also improves the immunity of the optomechanical
entanglement to the thermal excitations by about three orders of magnitude. We
also study the optomechanical entanglement in the network-coupled
optomechanical system consisting of two mechanical modes and two cavity modes.
By analyzing the correspondence between the optomechanical entanglement and the
dark-mode effect, we find that optomechanical entanglement can be largely
enhanced once the dark mode is broken. In addition, we study the mechanical
entanglement and find that it is negligibly small. We also present some
discussions on the experimental implementation with a microwave optomechanical
setup, on the relationship between the dark-mode-breaking mechanism and the
center-of-mass and relative coordinates, and on the explanation of the
important role of the dark-mode breaking in the enhancement of optomechanical
entanglement. Our results pave the way towards the preparation of entangled
optomechanical networks and noise-resistant quantum resources.

previous studies. This makes our system highly efficient and scalable. Second,
the pre-built 3D models provide the most reliable and robust 2D-3D matches.

learning (RL). In this paper, we address the problem of how to avoid safety
violations of RL agents during exploration in probabilistic and partially
unknown environments. Our approach combines automata learning for Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) and shield synthesis in an iterative approach.
Initially, the MDP representing the environment is unknown. The agent starts
exploring the environment and collects traces. From the collected traces, we
passively learn MDPs that abstractly represent the safety-relevant aspects of
the environment. Given a learned MDP and a safety specification, we construct a
shield. For each state-action pair within a learned MDP, the shield computes
exact probabilities on how likely it is that executing the action results in
violating the specification from the current state within the next $k$ steps.
After the shield is constructed, the shield is used during runtime and blocks
any actions that induce a too large risk from the agent. The shielded agent
continues to explore the environment and collects new data on the environment.
Iteratively, we use the collected data to learn new MDPs with higher accuracy,
resulting in turn in shields able to prevent more safety violations. We
implemented our approach and present a detailed case study of a Q-learning
agent exploring slippery Gridworlds. In our experiments, we show that as the
agent explores more and more of the environment during training, the improved
learned models lead to shields that are able to prevent many safety violations.

a stochastic differential equation (SDE), which smoothly converts graphs within
the complex distribution to random graphs that follow a known edge probability.
Solving the corresponding reverse-time SDE, graphs can be generated from newly
sampled random graphs. To facilitate the reverse-time SDE, we newly design a
position-enhanced graph score network, capturing the evolving structure and
position information from perturbed graphs for permutation equivariant score
estimation. Under the evaluation of comprehensive metrics, our proposed
generative diffusion process achieves competitive performance in graph

possibly non-convex functions. This optimization problem has deserved much
attention in the past years due to the many applications in different fields,
the most challenging being training Machine Learning models. Widely used
approaches for solving this problem are mini-batch gradient methods which, at
each iteration, update the decision vector moving along the gradient of a
mini-batch of the component functions. We consider the Incremental Gradient
(IG) and the Random reshuffling (RR) methods which proceed in cycles, picking
batches in a fixed order or by reshuffling the order after each epoch.
Convergence properties of these schemes have been proved under different
assumptions, usually quite strong. We aim to define ease-controlled
modifications of the IG/RR schemes, which require a light additional
computational effort and can be proved to converge under very weak and standard
assumptions. In particular, we define two algorithmic schemes, monotone or
non-monotone, in which the IG/RR iteration is controlled by using a watchdog
rule and a derivative-free line search that activates only sporadically to
guarantee convergence. The two schemes also allow controlling the updating of
the stepsize used in the main IG/RR iteration, avoiding the use of preset
rules. We prove convergence under the lonely assumption of Lipschitz continuity
of the gradients of the component functions and perform extensive computational
analysis using Deep Neural Architectures and a benchmark of datasets. We
compare our implementation with both full batch gradient methods and online
standard implementation of IG/RR methods, proving that the computational effort
is comparable with the corresponding online methods and that the control on the
learning rate may allow faster decrease.

the symmetry of the gap function is odd in frequency. Here we show that an
inherent odd-frequency mode emerges dynamically under application of a Lorentz
transformation of the anomalous Green function with the general
frequency-dependent gap function. To see this, we consider a Dirac model with
quartic potential and perform a mean-field analysis to obtain a relativistic
Bogoliubov-de Gennes system. Solving the resulting Gor'kov equations yields
expressions for relativistic normal and anomalous Green functions. The form of
the relativistically invariant pairing term is chosen such that it reduces to
BCS form in the non-relativistic limit. We choose an ansatz for the gap
function in a particular frame which is even-frequency and analyze the effects
on the anomalous Green function under a boost into a relativistic frame. The
odd-frequency pairing emerges dynamically as a result of the boost. In the
boosted frame the order parameter contains terms which are both even and odd in
frequency. The relativistic correction to the anomalous Green function to first
order in the boost parameter is completely odd in frequency. This work provides
evidence that odd-frequency pairing may form intrinsically within relativistic
superconductors.

this work, we analyze the 13.7~yr \emph{Fermi}-LAT data to investigate the
$\gamma$-ray feature in/around the SNR G298.6$-$0.0 region. With $\gamma$-ray
spatial analyses, we detect three point-like components. Among them, Src-NE is
at the eastern SNR shell, and Src-NW is adjacent to the western edge of this
SNR. Src-NE and Src-NW demonstrate spectral breaks at energies around/below
1.8~GeV, suggesting an old SNR age of $>$10~kyr. We also look into the X-ray
emission from the G298.6$-$0.0 region, with the Chandra-ACIS data. We detected
an extended keV source having a centrally filled structure inside the radio
shell. The X-ray spectra are well fit by a model which assumes a collisional
ionisation equilibrium of the thermal plasma, further supporting an old SNR
age. Based on our analyses of the NANTEN CO- and ATCA-Parkes HI-line data, we
determined a kinematic distance of $\sim$10.1~kpc from us to G298.6$-$0.0. This
distance entails a large physical radius of the SNR of $\sim$15.5~pc, which is
an additional evidence for an old age of $>$10~kyr. Besides, the CO data cube
enables us to three-dimensionally locate the molecular clouds (MCs) which are
potentially interacting with SNR G298.6$-$0.0 and could account for the

the industry, given the high criticality in production processes. Extracting
useful information from relevant signals is a key factor for effective
monitoring: studies in the areas of Informative Frequency Band selection (IFB)
and Feature Extraction/Selection have demonstrated to be effective approaches.
However, in general, typical methods in such areas focuses on identifying bands
where impulsive excitations are present or on analyzing the relevance of the
features after its signal extraction: both approaches lack in terms of
procedure automation and efficiency. Typically, the approaches presented in the
literature fail to identify frequencies relevant for the vibration analysis of
a rotating machinery; moreover, with such approaches features can be extracted
from irrelevant bands, leading to additional complexity in the analysis. To
overcome such problems, the present study proposes a new approach called Band
Relevance Factor (BRF). BRF aims to perform an automatic selection of all
relevant frequency bands for a vibration analysis of a rotating machine based
on spectral entropy. The results are presented through a relevance ranking and
can be visually analyzed through a heatmap. The effectiveness of the approach
is validated in a synthetically created dataset and two real dataset, showing
that the BRF is able to identify the bands that present relevant information
for the analysis of rotating machinery.

  data","4 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown that the Standard Model can very successfully reproduce
inclusive hadronic cross section data from $e^+e^-$ collisions at a wide range
of energies. Embedded in the Standard Model analysis, however, is the
assumption that $e^+e^-\to u\bar{u}$ events generally produce different
hadronic states than $e^+e^-\to d\bar{d}$ events. Is that assumption justified?
It is argued that for most $e^+e^-\to u\bar{u}$ events, there is a $e^+e^-\to
d\bar{d}$ event that produces the same set of hadrons with the same momenta. If
interference from these events is taken into account, it may be difficult for
the Standard Model to reproduce inclusive hadronic cross section data.

cosmological interest, such as the number of $e$-folds during inflation,
reheating, and radiation, as well as the reheating temperature. The main
assumption is to represent each of the various epochs of evolution of the
universe as being due to a single substance changing instantaneously into the
next, describing a new era of evolution of the universe. This assumption,
commonly used to obtain solutions of the Friedmann equations for simple
cosmological models, is implemented here to find model-independent bounds on
cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, we find that the bound
$N_k\approx 56$ for $-\frac{1}{3} < \omega_{re} < \frac{1}{3}$ is very robust
as an upper bound on the number of $e$-folds during inflation and also as a
lower bound when $\omega_{re} > \frac{1}{3}$, where $\omega_{re}$ is the
effective equation of state parameter during reheating. These are
model-independent results that any single-field model of inflation should
satisfy. As an example, we illustrate the two approaches with the basic
$\alpha$ attractor model and show how they complement each other.

this paper, a device fingerprinting (DFP) method has been proposed for device
identification, based on digital footprints, which devices use for
communication over a network. A subset of nine features have been selected from
the network and transport layers of a single transmission control
protocol/internet protocol packet based on attribute evaluators in Weka, to
generate device-specific signatures. The method has been evaluated on two
online datasets, and an experimental dataset, using different supervised
machine learning (ML) algorithms. Results have shown that the method is able to
distinguish device type with up to 100% precision using the random forest (RF)
classifier, and classify individual devices with up to 95.7% precision. These
results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed DFP method for device
identification, in order to provide a more secure and robust network.

important role in thermal transport phenomena. However, interfacial thermal
transport remains poorly understood due to complex physics across a wide range
of length scales from atomistic to microscale. Past studies on interfacial
thermal resistance have focused on interface-phonon scattering at the atomistic
scale but overlooked the complex interplay of phonon-interface and
phonon-phonon scattering at microscale. Here, we use the Peierls-Boltzmann
transport equation to show that the resistance from the phonon-phonon
scattering of non-equilibrium phonons near a Si-Ge interface is much larger
than that directly caused by the interface scattering. We report that
non-equilibrium in phonon distribution leads to significant entropy generation
and thermal resistance upon three-phonon scattering by the Boltzmann's
H-theorem. The physical origin of non-equilibrium phonons in Ge is explained
with the mismatch of phonon dispersion, density-of-states, and group velocity,
which serve as general guidance for estimating the non-equilibrium effect on
interfacial thermal resistance. Our study bridges a gap between atomistic scale
and less studied microscale phenomena, providing comprehensive understanding of
overall interfacial thermal transport and the significant role of phonon-phonon
scattering.

graph self-supervision, and dense retriever-based models. We constructed two
text-based multiple-choice question answering sets: BDD-QA for evaluating
causal reasoning in the traffic domain and HDT-QA for measuring the possession
of domain knowledge akin to human driving license tests. Among the methods,
Unified-QA reaches the best performance on the BDD-QA dataset with the
adaptation of multiple formats of question answers. Language models trained
with inference information and commonsense knowledge are also good at
predicting the cause and effect in the traffic domain but perform badly at
answering human-driving QA sets. For such sets, DPR+Unified-QA performs the
best due to its efficient knowledge extraction.

results encompass the full retardation correction to the one-photon exchange
van-der-Waals potential. We employ the temporal gauge for the virtual photon
propagator. Based on the Feynman prescription, we obtain the imaginary part of
the interaction energy, which leads to an interaction-induced correction to the
decay rate. Our results lead to precise formulas for the distance-dependent
enhancement and suppression of the decay rates of entangled superradiant and

adjacent to a charge-selective interface) has been well studied for
single-phase mixed conductors (e.g., liquid electrolyte), but multiphase CP has
been rarely addressed in literature. In our recent publication, we proposed
that CP above certain threshold currents can flip the phase distribution in
multiphase ion-intercalation nanofilms sandwiched by ion-blocking electrodes.
We call this phenomenon as multiphase polarization (MP). We then proposed that
MP can further lead to nonvolatile interfacial resistive switching (RS) for
asymmetric electrodes with ion-modulated electron transfer, which theory can
reproduce the experimental results of LTO memristors. In this work, we derive a
comprehensive 2D phase-field model for coupled ion-electron transport in
ion-intercalation materials, with surface effects including electron transfer
kinetics, non-neutral wetting, energy relaxation, and surface charge. Then we
use the model to study MP. We present time evolution of phase boundaries, and
analyze the switching time, current, energy, and cyclic voltammetry, for
various boundary conditions. We find that the switching performance can be
improved significantly by manipulating surface conditions and mean
concentration. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP-based memories and
possible extensions of the current model.

endeavors, the disparity between humans and artificial systems is extremely
apparent. Although this difference fundamentally divides the capabilities of
each, human-level intelligence (HLI) has remained the aim of AGI for decades.
This paper opposes the binarity of the Turing Test, the foundation of this
intention and original establishment of a potentially intelligent machine. It
discusses how AI experts misinterpreted the Imitation Game as a means to
anthropomorphize computer systems and asserts that HLI is a red herring that
distracts current research from relevant problems. Despite the extensive
research on the potential design of an AGI application, there has been little
consideration of how such a system will access and ingest data at a human-like
level. Although current machines may emulate specific human attributes, AGI is
developed under the pretense that this can be easily scaled up to a general
intelligence level. This paper establishes contextual and rational attributes
that perpetuate the variation between human and AI data collection abilities
and explores the characteristics that current AGI lacks. After asserting that
AGI should not be seeking HLI, its current state is analyzed, the Turing Test
is reevaluated, and the future of AGI development is discussed within this
framework.
