  Speaker Recognition",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Very deep models for speaker recognition (SR) have demonstrated remarkable
performance improvement in recent research. However, it is impractical to
deploy these models for on-device applications with constrained computational
resources. On the other hand, light-weight models are highly desired in
practice despite their sub-optimal performance. This research aims to improve
light-weight SR models through large-scale label-free knowledge distillation
(KD). Existing KD approaches for SR typically require speaker labels to learn
task-specific knowledge, due to the inefficiency of conventional loss for
distillation. To address the inefficiency problem and achieve label-free KD, we
propose to employ the contrastive loss from self-supervised learning for
distillation. Extensive experiments are conducted on a collection of public
speech datasets from diverse sources. Results on light-weight SR models show
that the proposed approach of label-free KD with contrastive loss consistently
outperforms both conventional distillation methods and self-supervised learning
methods by a significant margin.

However, there has been limited research on the zero-shot KBC settings, where
we need to deal with unseen entities and relations that emerge in a constantly
growing knowledge base. In this work, we systematically examine different
possible scenarios of zero-shot KBC and develop a comprehensive benchmark,
ZeroKBC, that covers these scenarios with diverse types of knowledge sources.
Our systematic analysis reveals several missing yet important zero-shot KBC
settings. Experimental results show that canonical and state-of-the-art KBC
systems cannot achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging benchmark.
By analyzing the strength and weaknesses of these systems on solving ZeroKBC,
we further present several important observations and promising future

Machine Learning (ML) approaches (LASSO, Boosting, Random Forest) compare them
to the GLM model used in insurance modelling. ML methodologies can use a large
set of information efficiently by performing the variable selection. A highly
accurate parsimonious model helps us understand the factors affecting insurance
participation and design better products.ML predicts fairly well despite the
complexity of insurance participation problem. Our results suggest Boosting
performs better than the other two ML tools using a smaller set of regressors.
The proposed ML tools identify which variables explain participation choice.
This information includes the number of cases in which single variables are

protection of a target spacecraft trying to evade an interceptor was developed.
The target spacecraft performs evasive maneuvers, launching an active defense
vehicle to divert the interceptor. Instead of classical strategies, which are
based on optimal control or differential game theory, the problem was solved by
using the deep reinforcement learning method, and imperfect information was
assumed for the interceptor maneuverability. To address the sparse reward
problem, a universal reward design method and an increasingly difficult
training approach were presented utilizing the shaping technique. Guidance law,
reward function, and training approach were demonstrated through the learning
process and Monte Carlo simulations. The application of the non-sparse reward
function and increasingly difficult training approach accelerated the model
convergence, alleviating the overfitting problem. Considering a standard
optimal guidance law as a benchmark, the effectiveness, and the advantages,
that guarantee the target spacecraft's escape and win rates in a multi-agent
game, of the proposed guidance strategy were validated by the simulation
results. The trained agent's adaptiveness to the interceptor maneuverability
was superior to the optimal guidance law. Moreover, compared to the standard
optimal guidance law, the proposed guidance strategy performed better with less

software architects to properly evaluate their architectural decisions with
sound experiential devices and/or practical design principles. On the one hand,
Microservices are fine-grained, loosely coupled services that communicate
through lightweight protocols. On the other hand, each microservice can use a
different software stack, be deployed and scaled independently or even executed
in different containers, which provide isolation and a wide-range of
configuration options but also offer unforeseeable architectural interactions
and under-explored architecture smells, with such experience captured mainly in
software repositories where such solutions are cycled.
  This paper adopts a mining software repositories (MSR) approach to capture
the practice within the microservice architecture landscape, by eliciting and
analysing Docker configuration files, being Docker the leading technical device
to design for, and implement modern microservices. Our analysis of Docker-based
microservices gives an interesting summary of the current state of

  Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.DM cs.SI physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The fractal nature of complex networks has received a great deal of research
interest in the last two decades. Similarly to geometric fractals, the
fractality of networks can also be defined with the so-called box-covering
method. A network is called fractal if the minimum number of boxes needed to
cover the entire network follows a power-law relation with the size of the
boxes. The fractality of networks has been associated with various network
properties throughout the years, for example, disassortativity, repulsion
between hubs, long-range-repulsive correlation, and small edge betweenness
centralities. However, these assertions are usually based on tailor-made
network models and on a small number of real networks, hence their ubiquity is
often disputed.
  Since fractal networks have been shown to have important properties, such as
robustness against intentional attacks, it is in dire need to uncover the
underlying mechanisms causing fractality. Hence, the main goal of this work is
to get a better understanding of the origins of fractality in complex networks.
To this end, we systematically review the previous results on the relationship
between various network characteristics and fractality. Moreover, we perform a
comprehensive analysis of these relations on five network models and a large
number of real-world networks originating from six domains. We clarify which
characteristics are universally present in fractal networks and which features
are just artifacts or coincidences.

contrastive action representation learning (CARL) to learn frame-wise action

One is the self-supervised version that optimizes embedding space by minimizing
KL-divergence between sequence similarity of two augmented views and prior
Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance. The other is the weakly-supervised
version that builds more sample pairs among videos using video-level labels by
dynamic time wrapping (DTW). Experiments on FineGym, PennAction, and Pouring

collision requires minimum domain walls speed which we explain assuming an
attractive potential created by domain wall pair. On the contrary, when the
domain walls move at lower speeds, their collision is inelastic and results in
a dispersing breather. Our findings will be important for the development
soliton-based computing using antiferromagnetic spintronics and we discuss
these perspective on our suggestions of how to create NOT and XOR gates.

after a while, JITs dynamically produce native code for parts of the program
they execute often. Although some time is spent compiling dynamically, this
mechanism makes for much faster times for the remaining of the program
execution. Such compilers are complex pieces of software with various
components, and greatly rely on a precise interplay between the different
languages being executed, including on-stack-replacement. Traditional static
compilers like CompCert have been mechanized in proof assistants, but JITs have
been scarcely formalized so far, partly due to their impure nature and their
numerous components. This work presents a model JIT with dynamic generation of
native code, implemented and formally verified in Coq. Although some parts of a
JIT cannot be written in Coq, we propose a proof methodology to delimit,
specify and reason on the impure effects of a JIT. We argue that the daunting
task of formally verifying a complete JIT should draw on existing proofs of
native code generation. To this end, our work successfully reuses CompCert and
its correctness proofs during dynamic compilation. Finally, our prototype can

simplify the meshing process and to reduce computational costs and memory
requirements. However, removing geometrical features of a domain often
introduces a non-negligible error in the solution of a differential problem in
which it is defined. In this paper, we aim at generalizing the work from [1],
in which an a posteriori estimator of the geometrical defeaturing error is
derived for domains from which one geometrical feature is removed. More
precisely, we study the case of domains containing an arbitrary number of
distinct features, and we perform an analysis on Poisson's, linear elasticity,
and Stokes' equations. We introduce a simple and computationally cheap a
posteriori estimator of the geometrical defeaturing error, whose reliability
and efficiency are rigorously proved, and we introduce a geometric refinement
strategy that accounts for the defeaturing error: Starting from a fully
defeatured geometry, the algorithm determines at each iteration step which
features need to be added to the geometrical model to reduce the defeaturing
error. These important features are then added to the (partially) defeatured
geometrical model at the next iteration, until the solution attains a
prescribed accuracy. A wide range of numerical experiments are finally reported
to illustrate and validate this work.

new perspective on the ultrafast emergence of topology in condensed matter

laser excitation even if the final state does not host stable skyrmions.
Simulations support these findings and reveal that the fluctuations originate
from the competition between spontaneous nucleation and decay of skyrmions,
consistent with Arrhenius-like activation over a potential barrier. Stable
skyrmions can freeze out of such fluctuations when the effective temperature of
the system relaxes faster than the decay time of the skyrmions. Our results
reveal a robust scenario for the generation of topological fluctuation states,

methods have shown that by tuning only 0.5% of the parameters, ViT can be
adapted to downstream tasks with even better performance than full fine-tuning.
In this paper, we aim to further promote the efficiency of PETL to meet the
extreme storage constraint in real-world applications. To this end, we propose
a tensorization-decomposition framework to store the weight increments, in
which the weights of each ViT are tensorized into a single 3D tensor, and their
increments are then decomposed into lightweight factors. In the fine-tuning
process, only the factors need to be updated and stored, termed Factor-Tuning
(FacT). On VTAB-1K benchmark, our method performs on par with NOAH, the
state-of-the-art PETL method, while being 5x more parameter-efficient. We also
present a tiny version that only uses 8K (0.01% of ViT's parameters) trainable

guarantee the performance of the single best action that is selected in
hindsight (a property referred to as \emph{Hannan consistency}, or

yardstick to evaluate strategies is limited, as any static action may perform
poorly in common dynamic settings. We propose the notion of \emph{dynamic
benchmark consistency}, which requires a strategy to asymptotically guarantee
the performance of the best \emph{dynamic} sequence of actions selected in
hindsight subject to a constraint on the number of action changes the
corresponding dynamic benchmark admits. We show that dynamic benchmark
consistent strategies exist if and only if the number of changes in the
benchmark scales sublinearly with the horizon length. Further, our main result
establishes that the set of empirical joint distributions of play that may
emerge, when all players deploy such strategies, asymptotically coincides with
the set of \emph{Hannan equilibria} (also referred to as \emph{coarse
correlated equilibria}) of the stage game. This general characterization allows
one to leverage analyses developed for frameworks that consider static
benchmarks, which we demonstrate by bounding the social efficiency of the
possible outcomes in our~setting. Together, our results imply that dynamic
benchmark consistent strategies introduce the following \emph{Pareto-type}

can be deterministically transformed into the input producing it -- we say that
the algorithm is invertible. While one can describe an invertible algorithm
using a general-purpose programming language, it is generally not possible to

Reversible languages enforce deterministic inverse interpretation at the cost
of expressibility, by restricting the building blocks from which an algorithm

  Jeopardy is a functional programming language designed for writing invertible
algorithms \emph{without} the syntactic restrictions of reversible programming.
In particular, Jeopardy allows the limited use of locally non-invertible
operations, provided that they are used in a way that can be statically
determined to be globally invertible. However, guaranteeing invertibility in
Jeopardy is not obvious.
  One of the central problems in guaranteeing invertibility is that of deciding
whether a program is symmetric in the face of branching control flow. In this
paper, we show how Jeopardy can solve this problem, using a program analysis
called available implicit arguments analysis, to approximate branching
symmetries.

components, i.e., VQ tokenizers and generative transformers. Prior research
focuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely
examines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability
of generative transformers. In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving
the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the
generation. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ
tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture
textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ
tokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation.
Different from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we
propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance
the two objectives. In the first phase, we propose a semantic-enhanced
perceptual loss for better semantic compression. In the second phase, we fix
the encoder and codebook, but enhance and finetune the decoder to achieve
better details preservation. The proposed SeQ-GAN greatly improves VQ-based
generative models and surpasses the GAN and Diffusion Models on both
unconditional and conditional image generation. Our SeQ-GAN (364M) achieves
Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.25 and Inception Score (IS) of 140.9 on

real-rootedness conjecture for all of these polynomials, and the problem of
computing them. We provide several intrinsic definitions of these invariants;
also, by leveraging that they are valuations under matroid polytope

resulting polynomials with certain real-rooted families such as the (binomial)
Eulerian polynomials, and we settle a conjecture of Hameister, Rao, and

uniform matroids maximize coefficient-wisely these polynomials for matroids

$\gamma$-positivity, a property for palindromic polynomials that lies between
unimodality and real-rootedness; this settles a conjecture of Ferroni, Nasr,

contributions, and the latter further into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.
In a flat band, intraband conductivity vanishes and the antisymmetric interband
contribution, proportional to the Berry curvature, corresponds to the anomalous
Hall effect. We investigate whether the symmetric interband conductivity,
related to the quantum metric, can be finite in the zero frequency and flat
band limit. Starting from the Kubo-Greenwood formula with a finite scattering
rate $\eta$, we show that the DC conductivity is zero in a flat band when
taking the clean limit ($\eta \rightarrow 0$). If commonly used approximations
involving derivatives of the Fermi distribution are used, finite conductivity
appears at zero temperature $T=0$, we show however that this is an artifact due
to the lack of Fermi surfaces in a (partially) flat band. We then analyze the
DC conductivity using the Kubo-Streda formula, and note similar problems at
$T=0$. The predictions of the Kubo-Greenwood formula (without the
approximation) and the Kubo-Streda formula differ significantly at low
temperatures. We illustrate the results within the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
where one expects vanishing DC conductivity in the dimerized limit as the unit
cells are disconnected. We discuss the implications of our results to previous
work which has proposed the possibility of finite flat-band DC conductivity
proportional to the quantum metric. Our results also highlight that care should
be taken when applying established transport and linear response approaches in
the flat band context, since many of them utilize the existence of a Fermi
surface and assume scattering to be weak compared to kinetic energy.

  overlap with arXiv:2209.10021",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Controller tuning is a vital step to ensure the controller delivers its
designed performance. DiffTune has been proposed as an automatic tuning method
that unrolls the dynamical system and controller into a computational graph and
uses auto-differentiation to obtain the gradient for the controller's parameter
update. However, DiffTune uses the vanilla gradient descent to iteratively
update the parameter, in which the performance largely depends on the choice of
the learning rate (as a hyperparameter). In this paper, we propose to use
hyperparameter-free methods to update the controller parameters. We find the
optimal parameter update by maximizing the loss reduction, where a predicted
loss based on the approximated state and control is used for the maximization.
Two methods are proposed to optimally update the parameters and are compared
with related variants in simulations on a Dubin's car and a quadrotor.
Simulation experiments show that the proposed first-order method outperforms
the hyperparameter-based methods and is more robust than the second-order
hyperparameter-free methods.

fundamental symmetries of atomistic configurations, such as permutation,

distances between atom pairs. There is growing interest in molecular
representations that work internally with higher rank rotational tensors, e.g.,
vector displacements between atoms, and tensor products thereof. Here we
present a framework for extending the Hierarchically Interacting Particle
Neural Network (HIP-NN) with Tensor Sensitivity information (HIP-NN-TS) from
each local atomic environment. Crucially, the method employs a weight tying
strategy that allows direct incorporation of many-body information while adding
very few model parameters. We show that HIP-NN-TS is more accurate than HIP-NN,
with negligible increase in parameter count, for several datasets and network
sizes. As the dataset becomes more complex, tensor sensitivities provide
greater improvements to model accuracy. In particular, HIP-NN-TS achieves a
record mean absolute error of 0.927 kcal/mol for conformational energy
variation on the challenging COMP6 benchmark, which includes a broad set of
organic molecules. We also compare the computational performance of HIP-NN-TS
to HIP-NN and other models in the literature.

Polarimetric observations in the different optical bands show that the degree

maximum chromatism, as well as the maximum observed polarization degree, was
detected during the minimum brightness state; during the flare state, the
polarization chromatism changed along with the flux gradient on the time-scale

$R$ from a policy $\pi$. To do this, we need a model of how $\pi$ relates to

Boltzmann rationality, and causal entropy maximisation. One of the primary
motivations behind IRL is to infer human preferences from human behaviour.
However, the true relationship between human preferences and human behaviour is
much more complex than any of the models currently used in IRL. This means that
they are misspecified, which raises the worry that they might lead to unsound
inferences if applied to real-world data. In this paper, we provide a
mathematical analysis of how robust different IRL models are to
misspecification, and answer precisely how the demonstrator policy may differ
from each of the standard models before that model leads to faulty inferences
about the reward function $R$. We also introduce a framework for reasoning
about misspecification in IRL, together with formal tools that can be used to
easily derive the misspecification robustness of new IRL models.

Quantization is usually constructed on the basis of an expansion in eigenmodes,
in the form of plane waves. Since they form a basis, other electromagnetic
configurations can be constructed by linear combinations. In this presentation
we discuss a formulation constructed in the general formalism of bosonic Fock
space, in which the quantum excitation can be constructed directly on localized
pulses of arbitrary shape. Although the two formulations are essentially
equivalent, the direct formulation in terms of pulses has some conceptual and
practical advantages, which we illustrate with some examples. The first one is
the passage of a single photon pulse through a beam splitter. The analysis of
this formulation in terms of pulses in Fock space shows that there is no need
to introduce ""vacuum fluctuations entering through the unused port"", as is
often done in the literature. Another example is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. It
is described as a time dependent process in the Schr\""odinger representation in
Fock space. The analysis shows explicitly how the two essential ingredients of
the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect are the same shape of the pulses and the bosonic
nature of photons. This formulation shows that all the phenomena involving
linear quantum optical devices can be described and calculated on the basis of
the time dependent solution of the corresponding classical Maxwell's equations
for pulses, from which the quantum dynamics in Fock space can be immediately
constructed.

the only available alternative to the standard Green's-function approaches to
EM scattering. We use it to offer an exact solution of the outstanding EM
scattering problem for an arbitrary finite collection of possibly anisotropic
nonmagnetic point scatterers lying on a plane. In particular, we provide a
comprehensive treatment of doublets consisting of pairs of isotropic point

not been yet demonstrated in fusion experiments. Some of the main problems
hindering controlled fusion are the imperfect magnetic confinement and the
associated plasma instabilities. Here, we theoretically demonstrate how to
create a fully confined magnetic field with the precise three-dimensional shape
required by fusion theory, using a bulk superconducting toroid with a toroidal
cavity. The combination of the properties of superconductors with the toroidal
topology makes the vacuum field in the cavity volume consisting of nested flux
surfaces, a condition for optimum plasma confinement. The coils creating the
field, embedded in the superconducting bulk, can be chosen with very simple
shapes, in contrast with the cumbersome arrangements in current experiments,
and can be spared from the large magnetic forces between them. Because the
field shape in the cavity is given by the boundary conditions in the
superconductor surface, the system will always tend to maintain the optimum
field distribution in response to instabilities or turbulence in the plasma.
This field shape is preserved even when holes are drilled in the superconductor
to access the plasma region from the exterior. We demonstrate how a
fully-confined magnetic field with the three-dimensional spatial distribution
required in two of the most advanced stellarators, Large Helical Device and
Wendelstein 7-X, can be exactly generated, using simple round coils as magnetic
sources. We argue that state-of-the-art high-temperature superconductors

strongly favours a planetary accretion shock with a line-luminosity-based
accretion rate dMp/dt = 2e-8 MJ/yr. The lines are asymmetric and well described
by sums of narrow and broad components with different velocity shifts. Overall
line shapes are best explained by a pre-shock velocity v0 = 170+-30 km/s,

case potentially strengthened by the presence of blueshifted emission in the
asymmetrical profiles.High-resolution spectroscopy offers the opportunity to
resolve line profiles, crucial for studying the accretion process in depth. The

freedom to a mesoscopic continuum system described by a few coarse-grained
equations is challenging. The common folklore is to take the thermodynamic
limit so that the physics of the discrete lattice describes the continuum
results. The analytical procedure to do so relies on defining a small length
scale (typically the lattice spacing) to coarse-grain the microscopic evolution
equations. Moving from the microscopic scale to the mesoscopic scale then
requires careful approximations. In this work, we numerically test the
coarsening in a Toda chain, which is an interacting integrable system, i.e. a
system with a macroscopic number of conserved charges. Specifically, we study
the spreading of fluctuations by computing the spatiotemporal thermal
correlations with three different methods: (a) Using microscopic molecular
dynamics simulation with a large number of particles; (b) solving the
generalized hydrodynamics equation; (c) solving the linear Euler scale
equations for each conserved quantities. Surprisingly, the results for the
small systems (c) match the thermodynamic results in (a) and (b) for
macroscopic systems. This reiterates the importance and validity of integrable
hydrodynamics in describing experiments in the laboratory, where we typically

structures with interesting properties. One such property is the presence of
flat bands. Typically, the presence of these requires long-ranged hoppings,
fine-tuning of nearest neighbor hoppings, or breaking time-reversal symmetry by
using a staggered flux distribution in the unit cell. We provide a prescription
based on carrying out projections from a parent system to generate different
flat band systems. We identify the conditions for maintaining the flatness and
identify a path-exchange symmetry in such systems that cause the flat band to
be degenerate with the other dispersive ones. Breaking this symmetry leads to
lifting the degeneracy while still preserving the flatness of the band. This
technique does not require changing the topology nor breaking time-reversal
symmetry as was suggested earlier in the literature. The prescription also
eliminates the need for any fine-tuning. Moreover, it is shown that the
subsequent projected systems inherit the precise fine-tuning conditions that
were discussed in the literature for similar systems, in order to have and
isolate a flat band. As examples, we demonstrate the use of our prescription to
arrive at the flat band conditions for popular systems like the Kagome, the
Lieb, and the Dice lattices. Finally, we are also able to show that a flat band
exists in a recently proposed chiral spin-liquid state of the Kagome lattice
only if it is associated with a gauge field that produces a flux modulation of
the Chern-Simons type.

into two parts. In rank-one sectors such entangled states are fairly
straightforward to construct so that most applications of the method have so
far been restricted to this simplest case. In this article we construct
entangled states for operators in $psu(1,1|2)$ sectors, importing a minimum of
information from the nested Bethe ansatz. The idea is successfully tested
against free field theory for a sample set of correlators with up to three
higher-rank operators. Further, we take a look at the same correlators in the
presence of marginal deformations of the theory. While a systematic
modification of the hexagon procedure remains out of reach for now, in
practical applications the undeformed amplitudes are surprisingly efficient,
especially for a certain one-parameter deformation.

descriptions of resources with their geo-location. There are, however, various
Semantic Web technologies where technical work is needed in order to achieve
the full integration of geospatial data, and federated query processing is one
of these technologies. Methods: In this paper, we explore the idea of
annotating data sources with a bounding polygon that summarizes the spatial
extent of the resources in each data source, and of using such a summary as an
(additional) source selection criterion in order to reduce the set of sources
that will be tested as potentially holding relevant data. We present our source
selection method, and we discuss its correctness and implementation. Results:
We evaluate the proposed source selection using three different types of
summaries with different degrees of accuracy, against not using geospatial
summaries. We use datasets and queries from a practical use case that combines
crop-type data with water availability data for food security. The experimental
results suggest that more complex summaries lead to slower source selection
times, but also to more precise exclusion of unneeded sources. Moreover, we
observe the source selection runtime is (partially or fully) recovered by
shorter planning and execution runtimes. As a result, the federated sources are
not burdened by pointless querying from the federation engine. Conclusions: The
evaluation draws on data and queries from the agroenvironmental domain and
shows that our source selection method substantially improves the effectiveness

making accurate predictions on downstream tasks, even if the model backbone is
kept frozen. The key challenge is how to utilize these intermediate features
given their gigantic amount. We propose visual query tuning (VQT), a simple yet
effective approach to aggregate intermediate features of Vision Transformers.
Through introducing a handful of learnable ``query'' tokens to each layer, VQT
leverages the inner workings of Transformers to ``summarize'' rich intermediate
features of each layer, which can then be used to train the prediction heads of
downstream tasks. As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learns
to combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to many
other parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt features
and need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests the
complementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning.
Empirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach that
utilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms full
fine-tuning in many cases. Compared to parameter-efficient approaches that
adapt features, VQT achieves much higher accuracy under memory constraints.
Most importantly, VQT is compatible with these approaches to attain even higher
accuracy, making it a simple add-on to further boost transfer learning.

sentence level. An important application area is law: past cases often do not
foretell how they apply to new situations and implications must be inferred.
This paper introduces LawngNLI, constructed from U.S. legal opinions with
automatic labels with high human-validated accuracy. Premises are long and
multigranular. Experiments show two use cases. First, LawngNLI can benchmark
for in-domain generalization from short to long contexts. It has remained
unclear if large-scale long-premise NLI datasets actually need to be
constructed: near-top performance on long premises could be achievable by
fine-tuning using short premises. Without multigranularity, benchmarks cannot
distinguish lack of fine-tuning on long premises versus domain shift between
short and long datasets. In contrast, our long and short premises share the
same examples and domain. Models fine-tuned using several past NLI datasets
and/or our short premises fall short of top performance on our long premises.
So for at least certain domains (such as ours), large-scale long-premise
datasets are needed. Second, LawngNLI can benchmark for implication-based
retrieval. Queries are entailed or contradicted by target documents, allowing
users to move between arguments and evidence. Leading retrieval models perform
reasonably zero shot on a LawngNLI-derived retrieval task. We compare different
systems for re-ranking, including lexical overlap and cross-encoders fine-tuned
using a modified LawngNLI or past NLI datasets. LawngNLI can train and test
systems for implication-based case retrieval and argumentation.

local norm bounds. This leads to a ""chicken and egg"" problem, where the local
norm bounds are required for controller synthesis, but the region of control
inputs needed to be characterized cannot be known prior to synthesis of the
controller. To tackle this issue, we constrain the closed-loop control inputs
within the sampling region while synthesizing the controller. As the resulting
synthesis problem is non-convex, three semi-definite programs (SDPs) are
obtained through convex relaxations of the main problem, and an iterative

magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of a spine-sheath

into a static cocoon. We explore different spine velocities and magnetic field
profiles with values being chosen to match typical Fanaroff-Riley type I/II

spine and the cocoon mainly due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The large

both the spine and the sheath, with a turbulent velocity spectrum consistent

control policies computed by more tractable ""deep"" methods lack guarantees and
tend to exhibit little robustness to uncertain operating conditions. This work
introduces a novel approach enabling scalable synthesis of robust
safety-preserving controllers for robotic systems with general nonlinear
dynamics subject to bounded modeling error by combining game-theoretic safety
analysis with adversarial reinforcement learning in simulation. Following a
soft actor-critic scheme, a safety-seeking fallback policy is co-trained with
an adversarial ""disturbance"" agent that aims to invoke the worst-case
realization of model error and training-to-deployment discrepancy allowed by
the designer's uncertainty. While the learned control policy does not
intrinsically guarantee safety, it is used to construct a real-time safety
filter (or shield) with robust safety guarantees based on forward reachability
rollouts. This shield can be used in conjunction with a safety-agnostic control
policy, precluding any task-driven actions that could result in loss of safety.
We evaluate our learning-based safety approach in a 5D race car simulator,

  of Reinforcement Learning","WACV 2023 (19 pages, 9 figures; updated appendix)",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Discriminativeness is a desirable feature of image captions: captions should
describe the characteristic details of input images. However, recent
high-performing captioning models, which are trained with reinforcement
learning (RL), tend to generate overly generic captions despite their high
performance in various other criteria. First, we investigate the cause of the
unexpectedly low discriminativeness and show that RL has a deeply rooted side
effect of limiting the output words to high-frequency words. The limited
vocabulary is a severe bottleneck for discriminativeness as it is difficult for
a model to describe the details beyond its vocabulary. Then, based on this
identification of the bottleneck, we drastically recast discriminative image
captioning as a much simpler task of encouraging low-frequency word generation.
Hinted by long-tail classification and debiasing methods, we propose methods
that easily switch off-the-shelf RL models to discriminativeness-aware models
with only a single-epoch fine-tuning on the part of the parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance the
discriminativeness of off-the-shelf RL models and even outperform previous
discriminativeness-aware methods with much smaller computational costs.
Detailed analysis and human evaluation also verify that our methods boost the
discriminativeness without sacrificing the overall quality of captions.

several useful applications. Aims. In this article we present a generic
non-parametric formalism that allows one to accurately map the halo mass
function between two different mass overdensity definitions using the
distribution of halo sparsities defined as the ratio of the two masses. We show
that changing mass definitions reduces to modelling the distribution of halo
sparsities. Methods. Using standard transformation rules of random variates, we
derive relations between the halo mass function at different overdensities and
the distribution of halo sparsities. Results. We show that these relations
reproduce the N-body halo mass functions from the Uchuu simulation within the
statistical errors at a few percent level. Furthermore, these relations allow
the halo mass functions at different overdensities to be related to parametric
descriptions of the halo density profile. In particular, we discuss the case of
the concentration-mass relation of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. Finally, we
show that the use of such relations allows us to predict the distribution of
sparsities of a sample of haloes of a given mass, thus opening the way to
inferring cosmological constraints from individual galaxy cluster sparsity

WASP-43b at 4.5 microns using the Spitzer Space Telescope, and reanalyzed a
previous 4.5 micron phase curve from Stevenson et al. (2017). We find no
significant time variability between these three phase curves, which span
timescales of weeks to years. The three observations are best fit by a single
phase curve with an eclipse depth of 3907 +- 85 ppm, a dayside-integrated
brightness temperature of 1479 +- 13 K, a nightside-integrated brightness
temperature of 755 +- 46 K, and an eastward-shifted peak of 10.4 +- 1.8
degrees. To model our observations, we performed 3D general circulation model
simulations of WASP-43b with simple cloud models of various vertical extents.
In comparing these simulations to our observations, we find that WASP-43b
likely has a cloudy nightside that transitions to a relatively cloud-free
dayside. We estimate that any change in WASP-43bs vertical cloud thickness of
more than three pressure scale heights is inconsistent with our observed upper
limit on variation. These observations, therefore, indicate that WASP-43bs

photoheating feedback from the reionization process expected to reduce the
efficiency of star formation in low mass haloes. Hence, to fully understand
reionization and galaxy formation, we must study their impact on each other.
The THESAN project has so far aimed to study the impact of galaxy formation
physics on reionization, but here we present the new THESAN simulations with a
factor 50 higher resolution ($m_{\rm b} \approx 10^4$~M$_\odot$) that aim to
self-consistently study the back-reaction of reionization on galaxies. By
resolving haloes with virial temperatures $T_{\rm vir} < 10^4$~K, we are able
to demonstrate that simplistic, spatially-uniform, reionization models are not
sufficient to study early galaxy evolution. Comparing the self-consistent
THESAN model (employing fully coupled radiation hydrodynamics) to a uniform UV
background, we are able to show that galaxies in THESAN are predicted to be
larger in physical extent (by a factor $\sim 2$), less metal enriched (by $\sim
0.2$~dex), and less abundant (by a factor $\sim 10$ at $M_{\rm 1500}~=~-10$) by
$z=5$. We show that differences in star formation and enrichment patterns lead
to significantly different predictions for star formation in low mass haloes,
low-metallicity star formation, and even the occupation fraction of haloes. We
posit that cosmological galaxy formation simulations aiming to study early
galaxy formation $z \gtrsim 3$ must employ a spatially inhomogeneous UV
background to accurately reproduce galaxy properties.

shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) along with a deep understanding of
systematics that affect it. In this work, we demonstrate a general framework
for describing the impact of PSF systematics on the cosmic shear 2PCF, and
mitigating its impact on cosmological analysis. Our framework can describe
leakage and modeling error from all spin-2 quantities contributed by the PSF
second and higher moments, rather than just the second moments. We interpret
null tests using the HSC Year 3 (Y3) catalogs with this formalism, and find
that leakage from the spin-2 combination of PSF fourth moments is the leading
contributor to additive shear systematics, with total contamination that is an
order of magnitude higher than that contributed by PSF second moments alone. We
conducted a mock cosmic shear analysis for HSC Y3, and find that, if
uncorrected, PSF systematics can bias the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$
and $S_8$ by $\sim$0.3$\sigma$. The traditional second moment-based model can
only correct for a 0.1$\sigma$ bias, leaving the contamination largely
uncorrected. We conclude it is necessary to model both PSF second and fourth
moment contamination for HSC Y3 cosmic shear analysis. We also reanalyze the
HSC Y1 cosmic shear analysis with our updated systematics model, and identify a
0.07$\sigma$ bias on $\Omega_m$ when using the more restricted second moment
model from the original analysis. We demonstrate how to self-consistently use
the method in both real space and Fourier space, assess shear systematics in
tomographic bins, and test for PSF model overfitting.

rest-frame bands, are critical for comparing galaxies at various redshifts.
These corrections often rely on fits to empirical or theoretical spectral
energy distribution (SED) templates of galaxies. However, the templates limit
reliable K-corrections to regimes where SED models are robust. For instance,
the templates are not well-constrained in some bands (e.g., WISE W4), which
results in ill-determined K-corrections for these bands. We address this
shortcoming by developing an empirically-driven approach to K-corrections as a
means to mitigate dependence on SED templates. We perform a polynomial fit for
the K-correction as a function of a galaxy's rest-frame color determined in
well-constrained bands (e.g., rest-frame (g-r)) and redshift, exploiting the
fact that galaxy SEDs can be described as a one parameter family at low
redshift (0.01 < z < 0.09). For bands well-constrained by SED templates, our
empirically-driven K-corrections are comparable to the SED fitting method of
Kcorrect and SED template fitting employed in the GSWLC-M2 catalogue (the
updated medium-deep GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalogue). However, our method
dramatically outperforms the available SED fitting K-corrections for WISE W4.
Our method also mitigates incorrect template assumptions and enforces the
K-correction to be 0 at z = 0. Our K-corrected photometry and code are publicly

demonstrated. Remarkable sensitivity exists due to the size of system, which
affects the nuclear part of potentials and energy levels, whereas the Coulomb
barrier is common with the same atomic number. The calculated $1p$ energy and
decaying lifetime are roughly consistent to the experimental limitation. The
present TD-Dirac calculation is expected as applicable widely to proton-rich
nuclides in order to improve the REDF by utilizing the $1p$-emission data.

routinely prepared for diagnosis and treatment selection in medical practice.
WSI are very large (gigapixel size) and complex (made of up to millions of
cells). The current state-of-the-art (SoTA) approach to classify WSI subdivides
them into tiles, encodes them by pre-trained networks and applies Multiple
Instance Learning (MIL) to train for specific downstream tasks. However,
annotated datasets are often small, typically a few hundred to a few thousand
WSI, which may cause overfitting and underperforming models. Conversely, the
number of unannotated WSI is ever increasing, with datasets of tens of
thousands (soon to be millions) of images available. While it has been
previously proposed to use these unannotated data to identify suitable tile
representations by self-supervised learning (SSL), downstream classification
tasks still require full supervision because parts of the MIL architecture is
not trained during tile level SSL pre-training. Here, we propose a strategy of
slide level SSL to leverage the large number of WSI without annotations to
infer powerful slide representations. Applying our method to The Cancer-Genome
Atlas, one of the most widely used data resources in cancer research (16 TB
image data), we are able to downsize the dataset to 23 MB without any loss in
predictive power: we show that a linear classifier trained on top of these
embeddings maintains or improves previous SoTA performances on various
benchmark WSI classification tasks. Finally, we observe that training a
classifier on these representations with tiny datasets (e.g. 50 slides)
improved performances over SoTA by an average of +6.3 AUC points over all
downstream tasks.

into one coordinate system by non-linear transformation, serves as an essential
preprocessing step for neuroimaging data. Recent research on deformable image
registration is mainly focused on improving the registration accuracy using
multi-stage alignment methods, where the source image is repeatedly deformed in
stages by a same neural network until it is well-aligned with the target image.
Conventional methods for multi-stage registration can often blur the source
image as the pixel/voxel values are repeatedly interpolated from the image
generated by the previous stage. However, maintaining image quality such as
sharpness during image registration is crucial to medical data analysis. In
this paper, we study the problem of anti-blur deformable image registration and
propose a novel solution, called Anti-Blur Network (ABN), for multi-stage image
registration. Specifically, we use a pair of short-term registration and
long-term memory networks to learn the nonlinear deformations at each stage,
where the short-term registration network learns how to improve the
registration accuracy incrementally and the long-term memory network combines
all the previous deformations to allow an interpolation to perform on the raw
image directly and preserve image sharpness. Extensive experiments on both
natural and medical image datasets demonstrated that ABN can accurately
register images while preserving their sharpness. Our code and data can be

to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this
effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however,
we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by
simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and
lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we
find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this

out such non-plausible fibers using a novel fully-supervised learning approach.

an original Geometric Deep Learning method that can deal with variable size
fibers, while being invariant to fiber orientation. Our model considers each

consecutive points via the proposed sequence Edge Convolution, it can capture

have had an immense role in propelling the agricultural industry towards the
fourth agricultural revolution. Blockchain and IoT can greatly improve the
traceability, efficiency, and safety of food along the supply chain. Given
these contributions, there are many barriers to widespread adoption of this
technology, including a deficit in many workers' ability to understand and
effectively use this technology in addition to a lack of infrastructure to
educate and support these workers. This paper discusses the barriers to
adoption of blockchain and IoT technology in the agricultural supply chain. The
authors analyse the impact of Blockchain and IoT in the food supply chain and
methods in which governments and corporations can become more adaptable.
Through the reduction in imports and protection of demand for local farmers,
developing economies can create local sustainable agricultural ecosystems.
Furthermore, the use of both public and private Research and Development can
greatly contribute to the global knowledge on new technologies and improve many
aspects of the food supply chain. In conclusion, both governments and
corporations have a big role to play in the increased implementation of
progressive technologies and the overall improvement of the food supply chain

nonlinear transverse motion of plasma filaments, which induces asymmetry in

neuroimaging data analysis, where the goal is to extract the brain regions from

methods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised
settings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of
training samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error
correction. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and
conducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D
MRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and
registration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved
collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised collective
extraction and registration in neuroimaging data. We propose a unified
end-to-end framework, called ERNet (Extraction-Registration Network), to
jointly optimize the extraction and registration tasks, allowing feedback
between them. Specifically, we use a pair of multi-stage extraction and
registration modules to learn the extraction mask and transformation, where the
extraction network improves the extraction accuracy incrementally and the
registration network successively warps the extracted image until it is
well-aligned with the target image. Experiment results on real-world datasets
show that our proposed method can effectively improve the performance on
extraction and registration tasks in neuroimaging data. Our code and data can

is impossible to satisfy all symmetry implications that require the vanishing

supernova (SN) spectra trace the presence of circumstellar material (CSM)
around the massive progenitor stars of core-collapse SNe. The lines disappear
within days after the SN explosion, suggesting that this material is spatially
confined, and originates from enhanced mass loss shortly (months to a few
years) prior to explosion. We performed a systematic survey of H-rich (Type II)
SNe discovered within less than two days from explosion during the first phase
of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey (2018-2020), finding thirty
events for which a first spectrum was obtained within $< 2$ days from
explosion. The measured fraction of events showing flash ionisation features
($>36\%$ at $95\%$ confidence level) confirms that elevated mass loss in
massive stars prior to SN explosion is common. We find that SNe II showing
flash ionisation features are not significantly brighter, nor bluer, nor more
slowly rising than those without. This implies that CSM interaction does not
contribute significantly to their early continuum emission, and that the CSM is
likely optically thin. We measured the persistence duration of flash ionisation
emission and find that most SNe show flash features for $\approx 5 $ days.
Rarer events, with persistence timescales $>10$ days, are brighter and rise
longer, suggesting these may be intermediate between regular SNe II and
strongly-interacting SNe IIn.

equations (ODEs) cannot robustly and globally stabilize a point in compact,
boundaryless manifolds. This obstruction, which is topological in nature,
implies that traditional smooth optimization dynamics are not able to robustly
solve global optimization problems in such spaces. In turn, model-free
optimization algorithms, which usually inherit their stability and convergence
properties from their model-based counterparts, might also suffer from similar
topological obstructions. For example, this is the case in zeroth-order methods
and perturbation-based techniques, where gradients and Hessians are usually
estimated in real time via measurements or evaluations of the cost function. To
address this issue, we introduce a class of hybrid model-free optimization
dynamics that combine continuous-time and discrete-time feedback to overcome
the obstructions that emerge in traditional ODE-based optimization algorithms
evolving on smooth compact manifolds. In particular, we introduce a hybrid
controller that switches between different model-free feedback-laws obtained by
applying suitable exploratory geodesic dithers to a family of synergistic
diffeomorphisms adapted to the cost function that defines the optimization
problem. The geodesic dithers enable exploration of the manifold while
preserving its forward invariance, a property that is important for many
practical applications where physics-based constraints limit the feasible
trajectories of the system. The hybrid controller exploits the information
obtained from the geodesic dithers to achieve robust global practical stability
of the set of minimizers of the cost. The proposed method is of model-free
nature since it only requires measurements or evaluations of the cost function.
Numerical results are presented to illustrate the main ideas and advantages of
the method.

Polyakov loops as an order parameter of color deconfinement. Using the
configurations, we then calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
overlap Dirac operator that preserves the exact chiral symmetry. To inspect the
impacts of the external magnetic fields on the spectra of the overlap Dirac
operator, in the confinement and deconfinement phases, the spectral densities
are computed and the eigenvalues are compared with the predictions of random
matrix theory. Moreover, we then estimate the number of instantons and
anti-instantons from the topological charges. Finally, the decay constant,
chiral condensate, and eta-prime meson mass at the chiral limit are evaluated
by interpolations and the impacts of the external magnetic fields are
demonstrated. This article presents the preliminary results that are obtained
using lattices with small lattice volumes and coarse lattice spacing.

requirements, e.g., safety and comfort could be at odds with each other if
avoiding a collision calls for slamming the brakes. To resolve such conflicts,
assigning importance ranking to rules (i.e., imposing a rule hierarchy) has
been proposed, which, in turn, induces rankings on trajectories based on the
importance of the rules they satisfy. On one hand, imposing rule hierarchies
can enhance interpretability, but introduce combinatorial complexity to
planning; while on the other hand, differentiable reward structures can be
leveraged by modern gradient-based optimization tools, but are less
interpretable and unintuitive to tune. In this paper, we present an approach to
equivalently express rule hierarchies as differentiable reward structures
amenable to modern gradient-based optimizers, thereby, achieving the best of
both worlds. We achieve this by formulating rank-preserving reward functions
that are monotonic in the rank of the trajectories induced by the rule
hierarchy; i.e., higher ranked trajectories receive higher reward. Equipped
with a rule hierarchy and its corresponding rank-preserving reward function, we
develop a two-stage planner that can efficiently resolve conflicting planning
requirements. We demonstrate that our approach can generate motion plans in
~7-10 Hz for various challenging road navigation and intersection negotiation
scenarios.

break radius having a positive trend with mass that weakens with redshift. When
normalized by the stellar half-mass radius, the break radius has a weaker
relation with both mass and redshift. To test if our results are dependent on
the resolution or adopted physics of TNG50-1, the same analysis is performed in
TNG50-2 and Illustris-1. We find general agreement between each of the
simulations in their qualitative trends; however, the adopted physics between
TNG and Illustris differ and therefore the breaks, normalized by galaxy size,
deviate by a factor of $\sim$2. In order to understand where the break comes
from, we define two relevant time-scales: an enrichment time-scale and a radial
gas mixing time-scale. We find that $r_{\rm Break}$ occurs where the gas mixing
time-scale is $\sim$10 times as long as the enrichment time-scale in all three
simulation runs, with some weak mass and redshift dependence. This implies that
galactic disks can be thought of in two-parts: a star-forming inner disk with a
steep gradient and a mixing-dominated outer disk with a flat gradient, with the
break radius marking the region of transition between them.

framework includes a newly proposed similarity-keeping (SK) teacher-student KD

$\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}'$ contains a single symmetric 0-1-valued binary

problems. To prove that quantum isomorphic constraint function sets give the
same value on any planar #CSP instance, we apply a novel form of holographic
transformation of Valiant, using the quantum permutation matrix $\mathcal{U}$
defining the quantum isomorphism. Due to the noncommutativity of
$\mathcal{U}$'s entries, it turns out that this form of holographic
transformation is only applicable to planar Holant. To prove the converse, we
introduce the quantum automorphism group Qut$(\mathcal{F})$ of a set of

Qut$(\mathcal{F})$ as the signature matrices of planar
Holant$(\mathcal{F}\,|\,\mathcal{EQ})$ quantum gadgets. Then we define a new
notion of (projective) connectivity for constraint functions and reduce arity
while preserving the quantum automorphism group. Finally, to address the

benefit of long-range interactions between aggregated region-based

associations and the resulting representation, which often take the form of
attention, cannot model the underlying semantic structure of the scene (e.g.,
individual objects and, by extension, their interactions). In this work, we
take a step toward addressing this limitation. Specifically, we propose an
architecture where we learn to project image features into latent region
representations and perform global reasoning across them, using a transformer,
to produce contextualized and scene-consistent representations that are then
fused with original pixel-level features. Our design enables the latent regions
to represent semantically meaningful concepts, by ensuring that activated
regions are spatially disjoint and unions of such regions correspond to
connected object segments. The resulting semantic global reasoning (SGR) is
end-to-end trainable and can be combined with any semantic segmentation
framework and backbone. Combining SGR with DeepLabV3 results in a semantic
segmentation performance that is competitive to the state-of-the-art, while
resulting in more semantically interpretable and diverse region
representations, which we show can effectively transfer to detection and
instance segmentation. Further, we propose a new metric that allows us to

to sense the number of items in their environment already at birth. The
pervasiveness of this skill across the animal kingdom suggests that it should
emerge in very simple populations of neurons. Current modelling literature,
however, has struggled to suggest a simple architecture carrying out this task,
with most proposals suggesting the emergence of number sense in multi-layered
complex neural networks, and typically requiring supervised learning. We
present a simple quantum spin model with all-to-all connectivity, where
numerosity is encoded in the spectrum after stimulation with a number of
transient signals occurring in a random or orderly temporal sequence. We use a
paradigmatic simulational approach borrowed from the theory and methods of open
quantum systems out of equilibrium, as a possible way to describe information
processing in neural systems. Our method is able to capture many of the
perceptual characteristics of numerosity in such systems. The frequency
components of the magnetization spectra at harmonics of the system's tunneling
frequency increase with the number of stimuli presented. The amplitude decoding
of each spectrum, performed with an ideal-observer model, reveals that the
system follows Weber's law, one of the hallmarks of numerosity perception
across the animal kingdom. This contrasts with the well-known failure to
reproduce Weber's law with linear system or accumulators models.

edge-connectivity proofs, defined via an operation called \textit{lifting}
performed on pairs of edges incident with a vertex $s$ in a graph $G$. It
encodes the information of whether a pair of edges incident with $s$ forms a
good lift in the sense that lifting them preserves a certain prescribed local
edge-connectivity $k$ between the pairs of vertices different from $s$. Lifting
was studied by Lov\'asz \cite{Lovasz} and Mader and they proved the first two
significant results about it in 1976 and 1978 respectively, showing the
existence of one good lift under certain conditions. Later in 1992 lifting was
investigated further by Frank, who proved that there are $\lfloor deg(s)/2
\rfloor $ many good lifts. Thomassen showed in 2016 that if $G$ is Eulerian,
then the complement of $L(G,s,k)$ is disconnected. This was extended in the
same year by Ok, Richter, and Thomassen to graphs $G$ where only $deg(s)$ and
$k$ are required to be even, and they began the first detailed study of the
structure of the lifting graph for a general $G$. Here we give a more
comprehensive analysis of the structure of the lifting graph $L(G,s,k)$,
studied through the interaction of its maximal independent sets, which is a new
approach revealing more of the structure than seen in the inductive proof by
Ok, Richter, and Thomassen. We prove specific structures for the lifting graph
depending on the different possibilities for the parities of $deg(s)$ and $k$.
An important consequence is the description of the structure of a graph in case
its lifting graph has a connected complement. The graph $G-s$ consists of a
path or cycle of $((k+1)/2)$-edge-connected blobs, with consecutive blobs
joined by precisely $(k-1)/2$ edges except in the case when the structure is a
path of length $2$ of blobs.

propose the generalization of the well-known Newton-Cayley problem. Newtonian
Julia set is a fractal boundary on the complex plane, which divides areas of
convergence to different roots of cubic nonlinear complex equation when it is
solved with explicit Newton method. We consider similar problem for the
relaxed, or damped, Newton method, and obtain the implicit map, which is
non-invertible both time-forward and time-backward. It is also possible to
obtain the same map in the process of solving of certain nonlinear differential
equation via semi-implicit Euler method. The nontrivial phenomena, appearing in
such implicit maps, can be considered, however, not only as numerical
artifacts, but also independently. From the point of view of theoretical
nonlinear dynamics they seem to be very interesting object for investigation.
Earlier it was shown that implicit maps can combine properties of dissipative
non-invertible and Hamiltonian systems. In the present paper strange invariant

additive noise, any NESS is characterized by the minimum entropy production
compatible with the maximum dissipation along cycles in the trajectory space.
This result sheds light on the excess entropy production principle and the
onset of chiral symmetry breaking out-of-equilibrium, indicating that the
housekeeping dissipation is connected with the tendency of performing cycles in
a preferential direction. Finally, when multiplicative noise is present, we
find that the non-equilibrium functional has two dissipative symmetry-breaking
contributions, one stemming from cycles and the other from a
thermophoresis-like effect. Our framework paves the way to understand selection
phenomena as symmetry-breaking processes driven by non-equilibrium dissipation.

Our index provides an approximation to rankings produced by survey participants

disproportionately from this rise, with substantial gains going to younger
females and college graduates and with male non-college educated workers losing

only generate/accept counting regular or commutatively regular languages. Thus,
such a system that can generate/accept a non-counting regular or
non-commutatively regular language implies the existence of inherently

with hundreds of ions and provide a promising route toward scaling up trapped

laser-based multiqubit operations on trapped ions is off-resonant spontaneous
emission. While many trapped ion quantum computers or simulators utilize clock
qubits, other systems rely on Zeeman qubits, which require a more complex
calculation of this decoherence. We examine theoretically the impacts of
spontaneous emission on quantum gates performed with trapped ions in a high
magnetic field. We consider two types of gates -- light-shift and
Molmer-Sorensen gates -- and compare the decoherence errors in each. We also
compare different detunings, polarizations, and required intensities of the
laser beams used to drive the gates. We show that both gates can have similar
performance at their optimal operating conditions and examine the experimental
feasibility of various operating points. By examining the magnetic field
dependence of each gate, we demonstrate that when the $P$ state fine structure
splitting is large compared to the Zeeman splittings, the theoretical
performance of the Molmer-Sorensen gate is significantly better than that of
the light-shift gate. Additionally, for the light-shift gate, we make an
approximate comparison between the fidelities that can be achieved at high
fields with the fidelities of state-of-the-art two-qubit trapped ion quantum
gates. We show that, with regard to spontaneous emission, the achievable
infidelity of our current configuration is about an order of magnitude larger
than that of the best low-field gates, but we also discuss alternative
configurations with potential error rates that are comparable with

engineering domains. This problem can be approached by learning state
transition rules from observations using machine learning techniques. Such
observed time-series data often consist of sequences of many continuous
variables with noise and ambiguity, but we often need rules of dynamics that
can be modeled with a few essential variables. In this work, we propose a
method for extracting a small number of essential hidden variables from
high-dimensional time-series data and for learning state transition rules
between these hidden variables. The proposed method is based on the Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM), which treats observable data in the visible layer and
latent features in the hidden layer. However, real-world data, such as video
and audio, include both discrete and continuous variables, and these variables
have temporal relationships. Therefore, we propose Recurrent Temporal
GaussianBernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTGB-RBM), which combines
Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GB-RBM) to handle continuous
visible variables, and Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RT-RBM)
to capture time dependence between discrete hidden variables. We also propose a
rule-based method that extracts essential information as hidden variables and
represents state transition rules in interpretable form. We conduct experiments

Experimental results show that our method can learn the dynamics of those

high-fidelity computational models is often prohibitively expensive, especially
when the probability is small. Exploiting low-fidelity models can make this
process more feasible, but merging information from multiple low-fidelity and
high-fidelity models poses several challenges. This paper presents a robust
multi-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy in which the multi-fidelity
surrogate is assembled using an active learning strategy using an on-the-fly
model adequacy assessment set within a subset simulation framework for
efficient reliability analysis. The multi-fidelity surrogate is assembled by
first applying a Gaussian process correction to each low-fidelity model and
assigning a model probability based on the model's local predictive accuracy
and cost. Three strategies are proposed to fuse these individual surrogates
into an overall surrogate model based on model averaging and
deterministic/stochastic model selection. The strategies also dictate which
model evaluations are necessary. No assumptions are made about the
relationships between low-fidelity models, while the high-fidelity model is
assumed to be the most accurate and most computationally expensive model.
Through two analytical and two numerical case studies, including a case study
evaluating the failure probability of Tristructural isotropic-coated (TRISO)
nuclear fuels, the algorithm is shown to be highly accurate while drastically
reducing the number of high-fidelity model calls (and hence computational
cost).

sensing for gait monitoring, which is device-free, wide-ranged, and perceived
as more privacy-friendly. Although it has succeeded in temporal gait event
extraction, it shows limited performance for spatial gait parameter estimation
due to imprecise footstep localization. In particular, the localization error
mainly comes from the estimation error of the wave arrival time at the
vibration sensors and its error propagation to wave velocity estimations.
Therefore, we present GaitVibe+, a vibration-based footstep localization method
fused with temporarily installed cameras for in-home gait analysis. Our method
has two stages: fusion and operating. In the fusion stage, both cameras and
vibration sensors are installed to record only a few trials of the subject's
footstep data, through which we characterize the uncertainty in wave arrival
time and model the wave velocity profiles for the given structure. In the
operating stage, we remove the camera to preserve privacy at home. The footstep
localization is conducted by estimating the time difference of arrival (TDoA)
over multiple vibration sensors, whose accuracy is improved through the reduced
uncertainty and velocity modeling during the fusion stage. We evaluate
GaitVibe+ through a real-world experiment with 50 walking trials. With only 3

considerable interest from the computer vision research community in recent

human-computer interaction. What makes it challenging are the complex poses,
understanding different viewpoints, and the environmental scenarios where the
action is taking place. To address such complexities, in this paper, we propose
a novel Sparse Weighted Temporal Attention (SWTA) module to utilize sparsely
sampled video frames for obtaining global weighted temporal attention. The
proposed SWTA is comprised of two parts. First, temporal segment network that
sparsely samples a given set of frames. Second, weighted temporal attention,
which incorporates a fusion of attention maps derived from optical flow, with
raw RGB images. This is followed by a basenet network, which comprises a
convolutional neural network (CNN) module along with fully connected layers
that provide us with activity recognition. The SWTA network can be used as a
plug-in module to the existing deep CNN architectures, for optimizing them to
learn temporal information by eliminating the need for a separate temporal
stream. It has been evaluated on three publicly available benchmark datasets,
namely Okutama, MOD20, and Drone-Action. The proposed model has received an

surpassing the previous state-of-the-art performances by a margin of 25.26%,

charging facility innovation to tackle the challenge of overstay, leveraging
the idea of Robo-chargers - automated chargers that can rotate in a charging
station and proactively plug or unplug plug-in electric vehicles. We formalize
an operation model for stations incorporating Fixed-chargers and Robo-chargers.
Optimal scheduling can be solved with the recognition of the combinatorial
nature of vehicle-charger assignments, charging dynamics, and customer waiting
behaviors. Then, with operation model nested, we develop a planning model to
guide economical investment on both types of chargers so that the total cost of
ownership is minimized. In the planning phase, it further considers charging
demand variances and service capacity requirements. In this paper, we provide
systematic techno-economical methods to evaluate if introducing Robo-chargers
is beneficial given a specific application scenario. Comprehensive sensitivity
analysis based on real-world data highlight the advantages of Robo-chargers,
especially in a scenario where overstay is severe. Validations also suggest the
tractability of operation model and robustness of planning results for

in the design of modern devices for wave engineering. In passive devices,
operating the device in the nonlinear response regime is a common means for
realizing nonreciprocity. Because mirror-symmetric systems are trivially
reciprocal, breaking the mirror symmetry is a necessary requirement for
nonreciprocal dynamics to exist in nonlinear systems. However, the response of
an asymmetric nonlinear system is not necessarily nonreciprocal. In this work,
we report on the existence of stable, steady-state nonlinear reciprocal
dynamics in coupled asymmetric systems subject to external harmonic excitation.
We restore reciprocity in the asymmetric system by tuning two symmetry-breaking
parameters simultaneously. We identify response regimes in the vicinity of the
primary resonances of the system where the steady-state left-to-right
transmission characteristics are identical to the right-to-left characteristics
in terms of frequency, amplitude and phase. We interpret these regimes of
reciprocal dynamics in the context of phase nonreciprocity, wherein incident
waves undergo a nonreciprocal phase shift depending on their direction of
travel. We hope these findings help design devices with new functionalities for
controlling and steering of elastic waves.

by the scene's plenoptic function. This is achieved by using an MLP together
with a mapping to a higher-dimensional space, and has been proven to capture
scenes with a great level of detail. Naturally, the same parameterization can
be used to encode additional properties of the scene, beyond just its radiance.
A particularly interesting property in this regard is the semantic
decomposition of the scene. We introduce a novel technique for semantic soft
decomposition of neural radiance fields (named SSDNeRF) which jointly encodes
semantic signals in combination with radiance signals of a scene. Our approach
provides a soft decomposition of the scene into semantic parts, enabling us to
correctly encode multiple semantic classes blending along the same direction --
an impossible feat for existing methods. Not only does this lead to a detailed,
3D semantic representation of the scene, but we also show that the regularizing
effects of the MLP used for encoding help to improve the semantic

constrain its progenitor and explosion parameters. SN 2019kbj shows roughly
constant temperature during the first month after peak, indicating a power
source (likely circumstellar material interaction) that keeps the continuum
emission hot at ~15,000K. Indeed, we find that the radioactive decay of Ni56 is
disfavored as the sole power source of the bolometric light curve. A
radioactive decay + circumstellar-material (CSM) interaction model, on the
other hand, does reproduce the bolometric emission well. The fits prefer a
uniform-density CSM shell rather than CSM due to a steady mass-loss wind,
similar to what is seen in other Type Ibn SNe. The uniform-density CSM shell
model requires ~0.1 solar masses of Ni56 and ~1 solar mass of total ejecta to
reproduce the light curve. SN 2019kbj differs in this manner from another Type

fundamental role in recent deep learning based speech enhancement (SE) systems.
However, natural speech contains many fast-changing and relatively brief
acoustic events, therefore, capturing the most informative speech features by
indiscriminately using local and non-local attention is challenged. We observe
that the noise type and speech feature vary within a sequence of speech and the
local and non-local operations can respectively extract different features from
corrupted speech. To leverage this, we propose Selector-Enhancer, a
dual-attention based convolution neural network (CNN) with a feature-filter

feed them to local or non-local attention operations. In particular, the
proposed feature-filter is trained by using reinforcement learning (RL) with a

our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing approaches.
In particular, Selector-Enhancer is potentially effective for real-world

nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson (NW) prediction head that can be used with any

average of labels from a support set. The weights are computed from distances
between the query feature and support features. This is in contrast to the
dominant approach of using a learnable classification head (e.g., a
fully-connected layer) on the features, which can be challenging to interpret
and can yield poorly calibrated predictions. Our empirical results on an array
of computer vision tasks demonstrate that the NW head can yield better
calibration with comparable accuracy compared to its parametric counterpart,
particularly in data-limited settings. To further increase inference-time
efficiency, we propose a simple approach that involves a clustering step run on
the training set to create a relatively small distilled support set.
Furthermore, we explore two means of interpretability/explainability that fall
naturally from the NW head. The first is the label weights, and the second is
our novel concept of the ``support influence function,'' which is an
easy-to-compute metric that quantifies the influence of a support element on
the prediction for a given query. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the
influence function can allow the user to debug a trained model. We believe that
the NW head is a flexible, interpretable, and highly useful building block that

different entanglement quantifiers for quantum states. We explore the

entanglement of final states in terms of concurrence and negativity. We find
that if initial quantum states are maximally entangled and we make measurements
in the Bell basis, then average concurrence and average negativity of final

concurrence (average negativity) of the final states by taking the product of
concurrences (negativities) of the initial states. However, the measurement in
non-maximally entangled basis during entanglement swapping degrades the average
swapped entanglement. Further, the product of the entanglement of the initial
mixed states provides an upper bound to the average swapped entanglement of

  Workloads","13 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Emerging real-time multi-model ML (RTMM) workloads such as AR/VR and drone
control often involve dynamic behaviors in various levels; task, model, and
layers (or, ML operators) within a model. Such dynamic behaviors are new
challenges to the system software in an ML system because the overall system
load is unpredictable unlike traditional ML workloads. Also, the real-time
processing requires to meet deadlines, and multi-model workloads involve highly
heterogeneous models. As RTMM workloads often run on resource-constrained
devices (e.g., VR headset), developing an effective scheduler is an important
research problem.
  Therefore, we propose a new scheduler, SDRM3, that effectively handles
various dynamicity in RTMM style workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems.
To make scheduling decisions, SDRM3 quantifies the unique requirements for RTMM
workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive scheduling decisions,
considering the current system load and other inference jobs on different
models and input frames. SDRM3 has tunable parameters that provide fast
adaptivity to dynamic workload changes based on a gradient descent-like online
optimization, which typically converges within five steps for new workloads. In
addition, we also propose a method to exploit model level dynamicity based on
Supernet for exploiting the trade-off between the scheduling effectiveness and
model performance (e.g., accuracy), which dynamically selects a proper
sub-network in a Supernet based on the system loads.
  In our evaluation on five realistic RTMM workload scenarios, SDRM3 reduces
the overall UXCost, which is a energy-delay-product (EDP)-equivalent metric for
real-time applications defined in the paper, by 37.7% and 53.2% on geometric

reports finite element modeling (FEM) of pneu-nets at high angles, along with
repetitive experimentation at high deformation rates, in order to study the
effect and behavior of fatigue in soft robotic actuators, which would result in
deviation from the ideal behavior. Comparing the FEM model and experimental

IDE is to discover user interest regions from a database through multi-rounds
of user labelling. Existing IDEs adopt active-learning framework, where users
iteratively discriminate or label the interestingness of selected tuples. The
process of data exploration can be viewed as the process of training a
classifier, which determines whether a database tuple is interesting to a user.
An efficient exploration thus takes very few iterations of user labelling to
reach the data region of interest. In this work, we consider the data
exploration as the process of few-shot learning, where the classifier is
learned with only a few training examples, or exploration iterations. To this
end, we propose a learning-to-explore framework, based on meta-learning, which
learns how to learn a classifier with automatically generated meta-tasks, so
that the exploration process can be much shortened. Extensive experiments on
real datasets show that our proposal outperforms existing explore-by-example
solutions in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

believed to be an extension of the Low theorem from the 2 -> 2+gamma process to
radiative multi-particle production 2 -> n+gamma, where either initial, or
final charged hadrons participate in radiation. We demonstrate that this breaks
down unitarity of the S-matrix, so contradicts the optical theorem.

spicules and coronal jets, which can elucidate potential connections between
plasma jetting activity at different scales. With high-resolution observations
from the {\em New Vacuum Solar Telescope} and Solar Dynamic Observatory, we
investigate the origin of five groups of recurrent active-region macrospicules.
Before the launch of each macrospicule, we detect a compact bright patch (BP)
at its base where a newly emerging dipole contacts and cancel with the
pre-existing ambient field. The spectral diagnosis from the {\em Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph} at one of BPs reveals signatures of reconnection
at the lower atmosphere. Multiwavelength imaging of these BPs show that they
mainly occur at the rising phase of the flux emergence and slowly ascend from
the lower to the upper chromosphere. Remarkable macrospicules occur and fade
out once the BPs appear and decay from the AIA 304 A images, respectively. We
suggest that these macrospicules and related BPs form in a common reconnection
process, in which the increasing reconnection height between the emerging
dipole and the ambient field results in the observed variations from BPs to
macrospicules. Interestingly, most macrospicules show similar characteristics
to larger-scale coronal jets and/or smaller-scale spicules, i.e., the rotating
motions, the presence of minifilaments and BPs before the eruptions, and
magnetic flux emergence and cancellation. We conclude that the formation
mechanism of macrospicules should be the same as spicules and coronal jets,
i.e., solar jetting phenomena at different scales share the same physical
mechanism in association with magnetic reconnection.

in a nearly isolated environment, at the outskirt of the Virgo cluster. A
detailed morphological examination reveals that the accreted stellar population
is mainly deposited in the outer part of dE1256, where the tidal tail is most
prominent. The inner part of dE1256 is perfectly modeled with a simple S\'ersic
function of index n = 0.63 and half-light radius R$_{h}$ = 0.6 kpc, but in
contrast, the entire galaxy has a size of R$_{h}$ = 1.2 kpc. The mass ratio
between the host and the putative accreted dwarf galaxy is calculated to be
5:1, assuming that the observed two components, inner S\'ersic, and outer tidal

pressure of efficient communication and perceptual mechanism is supported by
more and more linguistic studies, including analysing four decades of
diachronic data from the Nafaanra language. This inspires us to explore whether
machine learning could evolve and discover a similar colour-naming system via
optimising the communication efficiency represented by high-level recognition
performance. Here, we propose a novel colour quantisation transformer,
CQFormer, that quantises colour space while maintaining the accuracy of machine
recognition on the quantised images. Given an RGB image, Annotation Branch maps
it into an index map before generating the quantised image with a colour
palette; meanwhile the Palette Branch utilises a key-point detection way to
find proper colours in the palette among the whole colour space. By interacting
with colour annotation, CQFormer is able to balance both the machine vision
accuracy and colour perceptual structure such as distinct and stable colour
distribution for discovered colour system. Very interestingly, we even observe
the consistent evolution pattern between our artificial colour system and basic
colour terms across human languages. Besides, our colour quantisation method
also offers an efficient quantisation method that effectively compresses the
image storage while maintaining high performance in high-level recognition
tasks such as classification and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superior performance of our method with extremely low bit-rate colours,
showing potential to integrate into quantisation network to quantities from
image to network activation. We will release the source code soon.

first language only, second language only, and second language embedded in the

of the second language are usually quite different due to the influence of the
first language. Therefore, it is a big challenge to accurately model the
pronunciation and intonation of the second language in different contexts
without mutual interference. This paper builds a Mandarin-English TTS system to
acquire more standard spoken English speech from a monolingual Chinese speaker.
We introduce phonology embedding to capture the English differences between
different phonology. Embedding mask is applied to language embedding for
distinguishing information between different languages and to phonology
embedding for focusing on English expression. We specially design an embedding
strength modulator to capture the dynamic strength of language and phonology.
Experiments show that our approach can produce significantly more natural and
standard spoken English speech of the monolingual Chinese speaker. From
analysis, we find that suitable phonology control contributes to better
performance in different scenarios.

models with mean vectors and covariance matrices as parameters, and adopt
predictive densities that belong to the extended models including the original
normal model. We adopt predictive densities that are optimal with respect to
the posterior Bayes risk in the extended models. The proposed predictive
density based on a superharmonic shrinkage prior is shown to dominate the
Bayesian predictive density based on the uniform prior under a loss function
based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our method provides an alternative to
the empirical Bayes method, which is widely used to construct tractable
predictive densities.

application scenarios of the 5G new radio, which has strict latency and
reliability requirements. Contention-based grant-free (GF) access protocols,
such as Reactive, K-Repetition, and Proactive, have been proposed for uplink
URLLC service. In the GF access, user equipment (UE) resends packet immediately
after an unsuccessful transmission such that the latency requirement can be
satisfied. Taking Reactive as an example, this paper studies the impact of 1-
persistent retransmission (1-pR) on the distribution of user-plane delay. We
define the number of UEs that try to send packets in each mini-slot as attempt
rate. We show that the 1-pR makes the attempt rate seen by the packet in
retransmission larger than that seen by the packet in the first transmission.
As a result, the successful probability of retransmission is lower than that of
the first transmission. Based on this observation, we derive the distribution
of user-plane delay, which also takes into account the delay incurred by
queueing process. We demonstrate that whether to include the effect of 1-pR and
queueing process in the analysis would have a significant impact on the
prediction accuracy of delay distribution.

limited quantity of structural data. Meanwhile, protein language models trained
on substantial 1D sequences have shown burgeoning capabilities with scale in a
broad range of applications. Nevertheless, no preceding studies consider
combining these different protein modalities to promote the representation
power of geometric neural networks. To address this gap, we make the foremost
step to integrate the knowledge learned by well-trained protein language models

a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including
protein-protein interface prediction, model quality assessment, protein-protein
rigid-body docking, and binding affinity prediction, leading to an overall
improvement of 20% over baselines and the new state-of-the-art performance.
Strong evidence indicates that the incorporation of protein language models'

information propagation module that learns the dynamic representations for each

the Intensive UT1$-$UTC measurement accuracy depends on the accuracy of
numerous models, including the VLBI station position. Intensives observed with
the Maunakea (Mk) and Pie Town (Pt) stations of the Very Long Baseline Array

the values of UT1$-$UTC measured by that baseline, rendering the data from the

  The results of our model comparisons showed that the models did not predict
bankruptcies very well on the original data set with the exception of Google
Cloud's machine learning having a high precision score. However, our
over-sampled and feature selection data set did perform very well. This could
likely be due to the model being over-fitted to match the narrative of the
over-sampled data (as in, it does not accurately predict data outside of this
data set quite well). Therefore, we were not able to create a model that we are
confident that would predict bankruptcies.
  However, we were able to find value out of this project in two key ways. The
first is that Google Cloud's machine learning model in every metric and in
every data set either outperformed or performed on par with the other models.
The second is that we found that utilizing feature selection did not reduce
predictive power that much. This means that we can reduce the amount of data to
collect for future experimentation regarding predicting bankruptcies.

in the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive
integer g (< k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at
least g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering
problem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start
considering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider
this problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring
may be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the
relationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the
solvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of
the proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the
g-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k <= 2g. Second, we show that
the problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log
g) moves when 2g + 1 <= k <= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be
solved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 <= k <=
8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 <= k <= 8g - 4, the move
complexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we
show that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of
O(gn) moves when k >= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering
problem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k >= 2g + 1. In addition,
agents require a total number of \Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp.,

challenge in designing a query language that accommodates the needs of a broad
spectrum of users. Our experience shows that users express different and often
contradictory preferences for how queries should be interpreted. These
preferences stem from users with differing usage contexts, technical
experience, and implicit expectations from using prior tools. At the same time,
designing a code search query language poses unique challenges because it
intersects traditional search engines and full-fledged programming languages.
For example, code search queries adopt certain syntactic conventions in the
interest of simplicity and terseness but invariably risk encoding implicit
semantics that are ambiguous at face-value (a single space in a query could
mean three or more semantically different things depending on surrounding
terms). Users often need to disambiguate intent with additional syntax so that
a query expresses what they actually want to search. This need to disambiguate
is one of the primary frustrations we've seen users experience with writing
search queries in the last three years. We share our observations that lead us
to a fresh perspective where code search behavior can straddle seemingly
ambiguous queries. We develop Automated Query Evaluation (AQE), a new technique
that automatically generates and adaptively runs alternative query
interpretations in frustration-prone conditions. We evaluate AQE with an A/B
test across more than 10,000 unique users on our publicly-available code search

a bilevel optimization model between the transit agency and riders with choice

problem. However, due to the complexity and combinatorial nature of the
ODMTS-DA, the exact algorithm exhibits difficulties on large-scale instances.
This paper aims at addressing this challenge in order to find high-quality
ODMTS-DA designs in reasonable time. It proposes five heuristic algorithms
whose designs are driven by fundamental properties of optimal solutions. The
performance of the heuristic algorithms are demonstrated on two test cases
leveraging real data: a medium size case study for the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti
region in the state of Michigan and a large-scale case study conducted in the
Atlanta metropolitan region in the state of Georgia. To evaluate the results,
besides directly comparing computational times and optimality gaps with the
exact algorithm, this paper introduces two additional metrics that leverage the
characteristics of optimal solutions with respect to customer adoption.
Computational results demonstrate that the heuristic algorithms find optimal
solutions for medium-size problem in short running times, and discover
high-quality solutions to the large-case study that improve upon the best
solution found by the exact algorithm in considerably less time. The ODMTS
designs obtained by these algorithms provide substantial benefits in terms of

extraction through two rounds of training. By defining a threshold of p-value,
we find in all Covid-19 related intervention-outcomes pairs with statistical

scenario of stable strangeon nuggets is studied. The
Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is applied to calculate the thermodynamics of
the QCD phase with u, d, s quarks, and the relativistic mean-field model
describes the hadronic matter. The crossover phase transition from quarks to
hadrons occurred at cosmic temperature of T~170 MeV, and those two phases are
connected in a three-window model. Due to quark's non-perturbative coupling,
quark clusters with net strangeness (i.e., strangeons) and then strangeon
nuggets could form during the transition process. A distribution function of
the nugget baryon number, A, is introduced to describe the nuggets' number
density. All the strangeon nuggets with A>A_c are considered to be stable,
where the critical number, A_c, is determined by both the weak and strong
interactions. A non-relativistic equation of state is applied to calculate the
thermodynamics of stable nuggets. The calculation shows that the
thermodynamical contributions (pressure, entropy, etc.) of the stable strangeon
nuggets are negligible. The resultant mass density of the strangeon nuggets
survival from the early Universe is comparable to the dark matter, that
indicates a possible explanation of the cold dark matter without introducing
any exotic particles beyond the standard model.

single objective to optimize (e.g., the total distance from clients to the
facility, or the maximum distance, etc.), but instead attempt to optimize
several different objectives simultaneously. More specifically, we consider the
$l$-centrum family of objectives, which includes the total distance, max
distance, and many others. We present tight bounds on how well any pair of such
objectives (e.g., max and sum) can be simultaneously approximated compared to
their optimum outcomes. In particular, we show that for any such pair of

approximates both objectives within a factor of $1+\sqrt{2}$, and give a
precise characterization of how this factor improves as the two objectives

suffer from trade-offs in terms of spatial resolution, overall throughput,
polarization asymmetry, operational bandwidth and isotropy. Here, we exploit
dispersion engineering to design and realize metasurfaces capable of performing
isotropic 2D edge detection over a broad operational bandwidth and for any

and large efficiency. Remarkably, we show that this performance can be achieved
within a single-layer metasurface consisting of a silicon photonic crystal on

edge-detection with numerical apertures up to 0.35, and operating within a
spectral bandwidth of 35 nm (5 THz) around 1500 nm. Moreover, we introduce
quantitative metrics to properly assess the efficiency of the analog image

superconductors remains elusive after being extensively studied for more than a
decade. Determination of the pairing symmetry is essential in understanding the
superconductivity mechanism. In the iron-based superconductors that have hole
pockets around the Brillouin zone center and electron pockets around the zone
corners, the pairing symmetry is generally considered to be s$_\pm$, endowing a
sign change in the superconducting gap between the hole and electron pockets.
For the iron-based superconductors with only hole pockets, however, a couple of
pairing scenarios have been proposed but the exact symmetry is still highly
controversial. Here we report our determination of the pairing symmetry in
KFe$_2$As$_2$ which is a prototypical iron-based superconductor with hole
pockets both around the zone center and around the zone corners. By taking
laser-based angle resolved photoemission measurements with super-high
resolution and at ultra-low temperature, we have precisely determined the
superconducting gap distribution and identified the locations of the gap nodes
on all the Fermi surface around the zone center and the zone corners. The
complete superconducting gap structure, in combination with the observation of
the spin resonance in neutron scattering, provides strong evidence on the
s$_\pm$ pairing symmetry in KFe$_2$As$_2$ with a gap sign reversal between the
hole pockets around the zone center and the hole pockets around the zone
corners. These results unify the pairing symmetry in the hole-doped iron-based
superconductors and point to the spin fluctuation as the pairing glue in
generating superconductivity.

Despite the frequent occurrence of such data, methods to analyze them are less
common and researchers often resort to either ignoring the multilevel and/or

combination of these. These analysis strategies are suboptimal: Ignoring
multilevel structures inflates Type I error rates, while neglecting the
multivariate or heterogeneous structure masks detailed insights. To analyze
such data comprehensively, the current paper presents a novel Bayesian
multilevel multivariate logistic regression model. The clustered structure of
multilevel data is taken into account, such that posterior inferences can be
made with accurate error rates. Further, the model shares information between
different subpopulations in the estimation of average and conditional average
multivariate treatment effects. To facilitate interpretation, multivariate
logistic regression parameters are transformed to posterior success

had targeted Type I error rates, while single-level alternatives resulted in
inflated Type I errors. A re-analysis of the Third International Stroke Trial

masked autoencoders. We randomly mask out the spatial-temporal tubes of input
video and the word tokens of input text and then feed them into a unified
autencoder to reconstruct the missing pixels and words. Our SimVTP has several
properties: 1) Thanks to the unified autoencoder, SimVTP reconstructs the
masked signal of one modality with the help from another modality, which
implicitly learns the cross-modal alignment between video tubes and text
tokens. 2) SimVTP not only benefits from a high video masking ratio (e.g. 90%)
due to the temporal redundancy of video, but also needs a high text masking
ratio (e.g. 75%), which is much higher than BERT (e.g. 15%), to achieve optimal
performance. This is because the aid of video modality makes text
reconstruction less challenging, which thus needs a higher mask ratio to make
the pretext harder for useful feature learning. 3) Equipping SimVTP with
video-text contrastive learning (VTC) and video-text matching (VTM), which are
two commonly used cross-modal training strategies, could further improve the
transferable performance significantly. 4) SimVTP is dataefficent, e.g.,
pre-training only on 10% data of WebVid-2M, SimVTP achieves surprisingly good
results (43.8 R@1) on MSRVTT, which is far above recent state-of-the-art

  Fine-tuning",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Script event prediction aims to predict the subsequent event given the
context. This requires the capability to infer the correlations between events.
Recent works have attempted to improve event correlation reasoning by using
pretrained language models and incorporating external knowledge~(e.g.,
discourse relations). Though promising results have been achieved, some
challenges still remain. First, the pretrained language models adopted by
current works ignore event-level knowledge, resulting in an inability to
capture the correlations between events well. Second, modeling correlations
between events with discourse relations is limited because it can only capture
explicit correlations between events with discourse markers, and cannot capture
many implicit correlations. To this end, we propose a novel generative approach
for this task, in which a pretrained language model is fine-tuned with an
event-centric pretraining objective and predicts the next event within a
generative paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a novel event-level blank
infilling strategy as the learning objective to inject event-level knowledge
into the pretrained language model, and then design a likelihood-based
contrastive loss for fine-tuning the generative model. Instead of using an
additional prediction layer, we perform prediction by using sequence
likelihoods generated by the generative model. Our approach models correlations
between events in a soft way without any external knowledge. The
likelihood-based prediction eliminates the need to use additional networks to
make predictions and is somewhat interpretable since it scores each word in the
event. Experimental results on the multi-choice narrative cloze~(MCNC) task
demonstrate that our approach achieves better results than other
state-of-the-art baselines. Our code will be available at

that an excessively small intra-platoon gap can impede traffic flow during
highway on-ramp merging. While existing control-based methods allow for
adaptation of the intra-platoon gap to improve traffic flow, making an optimal

shortage and impaired model generalization. Reversely, coarse polyp bounding
box annotations are more accessible. Thus, in this paper, we propose a boosted
BoxPolyp model to make full use of both accurate mask and extra coarse box
annotations. In practice, box annotations are applied to alleviate the
over-fitting issue of previous polyp segmentation models, which generate
fine-grained polyp area through the iterative boosted segmentation model. To
achieve this goal, a fusion filter sampling (FFS) module is firstly proposed to
generate pixel-wise pseudo labels from box annotations with less noise, leading
to significant performance improvements. Besides, considering the appearance
consistency of the same polyp, an image consistency (IC) loss is designed. Such
IC loss explicitly narrows the distance between features extracted by two
different networks, which improves the robustness of the model. Note that our
BoxPolyp is a plug-and-play model, which can be merged into any appealing
backbone. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on five challenging
benchmarks confirm that our proposed model outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation (LWSIS), which leverages the
off-the-shelf 3D data, i.e., Point Cloud, together with the 3D boxes, as
natural weak supervisions for training the 2D image instance segmentation
models. Our LWSIS not only exploits the complementary information in multimodal
data during training, but also significantly reduces the annotation cost of the
dense 2D masks. In detail, LWSIS consists of two crucial modules, Point Label

module aims to automatically assign the 3D point cloud as 2D point-wise labels,
while the latter further refines the predictions by enforcing geometry and
appearance consistency of the multimodal data. Moreover, we conduct a secondary
instance segmentation annotation on the nuScenes, named nuInsSeg, to encourage
further research on multimodal perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the

  Routing Problem","Need to be updated",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Meal delivery services provided by platforms with integrated delivery systems
are becoming increasingly popular. This paper adopts a rolling horizon approach
to solve the meal delivery routing problem (MDRP). To improve delivery
efficiency in scenarios with high delivery demand, multiple orders are allowed
to be combined into one bundle with orders from different restaurants.
Following this strategy, an optimization-based four-stage heuristic algorithm
is developed to generate an optimal routing plan at each decision point. The
algorithm first generates bundles according to orders' spatial and temporal
distribution. Secondly, we find feasible bundle pairs. Then, routes for
delivering any single bundle or multiple bundles are optimized, respectively.
Finally, the routes are assigned to available couriers. In computational
experiments using instances from open datasets, the system's performance is
evaluated in respect of average click-to-door time and ready-to-pickup time. We
demonstrate that this algorithm can effectively process real-time information
and assign optimal routes to the couriers. By comparing the proposed method
with existing the-state-of-the-art algorithms, the results indicate that our
method can generate solutions with higher service quality and shorter distance.

sufficient information transfer by aggregating multiple distillers as a

proposed to shorten the channels between the teacher and student models to

We aim to maximise the extracted energy through control while minimising the

waves, we first generate ground truth solutions by solving an optimal control
problem, and we analyse the MPC performance to determine a prediction horizon
that trades off accuracy and efficiency for computation. Fixed weights in the
MPC scheme can produce unpredictable costs for variable sea condition, meaning
the average rate of cost accumulation can vary vastly. To steer this cost
growth, we propose a heuristic to adapt the algorithm by changing the weighting
of the cost functions using for fulfilling the long-time goal of accumulating a
small enough damage in a fixed time. A simulated case-study is presented in

the amount of accumulated damage while remaining close to (or even improving)

Cahn-Hilliard dynamics of the concentration (phase-field) is governed by the
aggregation/diffusion competition of the nonlocal Helmholtz free energy with

existence of global strong solutions in general two-dimensional bounded domains

Furthermore, we demonstrate the uniqueness of strong solutions and their

important to know the activity cycles of these stars. We study systematic
long-term variability in a sample of 211 M dwarfs observed with CARMENES, the
high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectrograph at Calar Alto

indicators, we identified 26 stars with linear or quadratic trends or with
potentially cyclic behaviour. Additionally, we performed an independent search
in archival R$^{\prime}_{\rm HK}$ data collected from different instruments
whose time baselines were usually much longer. These data are available for a
subset of 186 of our sample stars. Our search revealed 22 cycle candidates in
the data. We found that the percentage of stars showing long-term variations
drops dramatically to the latest M dwarfs. Moreover, we found that the
pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of the H$\alpha$ and Ca ii infrared triplet more
often triggers automatic detections of long-term variations than the TiO index,
differential line width, chromatic index, or radial velocity. This is in line
with our comparison of the median relative amplitudes of the different
indicators. For stars that trigger our automatic detection, this leads to the
highest amplitude variation in R$^{\prime}_{\rm HK}$, followed by
pEW(H$\alpha$), pEW(Ca ii IRT), and the TiO index.

different kinds of corrections especially in models in which the PQ field

superimposed on the uplink user data to improve the spectral efficiency and
energy consumption for IoT systems, and two lightweight networks at the base
station (BS) alleviate the computational complexity and processing delay for
the CE and symbol detection (SD). These dedicated networks are developed in a
cooperation manner. That is, the conventional methods are employed to perform
initial feature extraction, and the developed neural networks (NNs) are
oriented to learn along with the extracted features. With the assistance of the
extracted initial feature, the number of training data for network training is
reduced. Simulation results show that, the computational complexity and
processing delay are decreased without sacrificing the accuracy of CE and SD,
and the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER)
performance at the BS are improved against the parameter variance.

concurrent precipitation on recovery and recrystallization is here analyzed by
directly correlating (sub)grains of P, CubeND or Cube orientation with
second-phase particles in a cold-rolled and non-isothermally annealed Al-Mn
alloy. The recrystallized state is dominated by coarse elongated grains with a
strong P, weaker CubeND and even weaker Cube texture. The correlated data
enables orientation dependent quantification of the density and size of
dispersoids on sub-boundaries and subgrains in the deformation zones around
large constituent particles. A new modified expression for the Smith-Zener drag
from dispersoids on sub-boundaries is derived and used. The results show that
the drag on (sub)grain boundaries from dispersoids is orientation dependent,
with Cube subgrains experiencing the highest drag after recovery and partial
recrystallization. The often observed size advantage of Cube subgrains in Al
alloys is not realized due to the increased drag, thereby promoting
particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN). Relatively fewer and larger dispersoids
in deformation zones around large particles give a reduced Smith-Zener drag on
PSN nuclei, thus further strengthening the effect of PSN. Observations
substantiating the stronger P texture compared to the CubeND texture are a
higher frequency of P subgrains and a faster growth of these subgrains. The
applied methodology enables a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the
orientation dependent nucleation and growth behavior during recovery and
recrystallization with strong concurrent precipitation in Al-Mn alloys. In
particular, the methodology gives new insights into the strong P and CubeND
textures compared to the Cube texture.

the federated learning process. When comparing conventional and federated

pruning inevitably involves a distribution truncation operation. They usually

propose a novel distribution-lossless pruning method, named DLLP, to

DLLP remodels the vanilla networks as discrete priors for the latent pruned

EASpace formulates each expert policy into multiple macro actions with
different execution time period, then integrates all macro actions into the
primitive action space directly. Through this formulation, the proposed EASpace
could learn when to execute which expert policy and how long it lasts. An
intra-macro-action learning rule is proposed by adjusting the temporal

reward proportional to the execution time of macro actions is introduced to
encourage the environment exploration via macro actions, which is significant
to learn a long-horizon task. Theoretical analysis is presented to show the

exponentially increased its usage. However, a tremendous surge in cloud
resource demand stave off service availability resulting into outages,
performance degradation, load imbalance, and excessive power-consumption. The
existing approaches mainly attempt to address the problem by using multi-cloud
and running multiple replicas of a virtual machine (VM) which accounts for high
operational-cost. This paper proposes a Fault Tolerant Elastic Resource
Management (FT-ERM) framework that addresses aforementioned problem from a
different perspective by inducing high-availability in servers and VMs.
Specifically, (1) an online failure predictor is developed to anticipate
failure-prone VMs based on predicted resource contention; (2) the operational
status of server is monitored with the help of power analyser, resource
estimator and thermal analyser to identify any failure due to overloading and
overheating of servers proactively; and (3) failure-prone VMs are assigned to
proposed fault-tolerance unit composed of decision matrix and safe box to
trigger VM migration and handle any outage beforehand while maintaining desired
level of availability for cloud users. The proposed framework is evaluated and
compared against state-of-the-arts by executing experiments using two
real-world datasets. FT-ERM improved the availability of the services up to
34.47% and scales down VM-migration and power-consumption up to 88.6% and
62.4%, respectively over without FT-ERM approach.

at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more

on RDF graphs. Recent work on formalizing this language has revealed a striking
relationship to description logics. SHACL expressions can use three fundamental
features that are not so common in description logics. These features are
equality tests; disjointness tests; and closure constraints. Moreover, SHACL is
peculiar in allowing only a restricted form of expressions (so-called targets)
on the left-hand side of inclusion constraints.
  The goal of this paper is to obtain a clear picture of the impact and
expressiveness of these features and restrictions. We show that each of the
four features is primitive: using the feature, one can express boolean queries
that are not expressible without using the feature. We also show that the
restriction that SHACL imposes on allowed targets is inessential, as long as
closure constraints are not used.
  In addition, we show that enriching SHACL with ""full"" versions of equality
tests, or disjointness tests, results in a strictly more powerful language.

conductance of a planar Josephson junction under microwave irradiation, and
interpreted replicas of conductance features as evidence of steady
Floquet-Andreev states. Here we realise a similar device in a hybrid
superconducting-semiconducting heterostructure, which utilises a tunnelling
probe with gate-tunable transparency and allows simultaneous measurements of
Andreev spectrum and current-phase relation of the planar Josephson junction.
We show that, in our devices, spectral replicas in sub-gap conductance emerging
under microwave irradiation are caused by photon assisted tunnelling of
electrons into Andreev states. The current-phase relation under microwave
irradiation is also explained by the interaction of Andreev states with
microwave photons, without the need to invoke Floquet states. For engineering

to recognise the intricacies of mesoscopic systems. This study harnesses the
advantages of gate-tunable devices to build an understanding of light-matter

foundation models to solve many time-series problems. Combining neural ODEs
with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular

to be defined based on the initial observed value or the last available
observation. This fact raises questions about how long the generated hidden
state is sufficient and whether it is effective when long sequences are used
instead of the typically used shorter sequences. In this article, we introduce
CrossPyramid, a novel ODE-based model that aims to enhance the generalizability
of sequences representation. CrossPyramid does not rely only on the hidden
state from the last observed value; it also considers ODE latent
representations learned from other samples. The main idea of our proposed model
is to define the hidden state for the unobserved values based on the non-linear
correlation between samples. Accordingly, CrossPyramid is built with three
distinctive parts: (1) ODE Auto-Encoder to learn the best data representation.
(2) Pyramidal attention method to categorize the learned representations
(hidden state) based on the relationship characteristics between samples. (3)
Cross-level ODE-RNN to integrate the previously learned information and provide
the final latent state for each sample. Through extensive experiments on
partially-observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed
architecture can effectively model the long gaps in intermittent series and
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The results show an average
improvement of 10\% on univariate and multivariate datasets for both

give an overview of existing continuous-time approaches to model red noise,

carrying certain attributes from the discrete-time to the continuous-time

far reaching consequences when posited in the continuous-time stochastic

Epidemic-economic models designed to address this issue are either too
aggregate to consider heterogeneous outcomes across socio-economic groups, or,
when sufficiently fine-grained, not well grounded by empirical data. To fill
this gap, we introduce a data-driven, granular, agent-based model that
simulates epidemic and economic outcomes across industries, occupations, and
income levels with geographic realism. The key mechanism coupling the epidemic
and economic modules is the reduction in consumption demand due to fear of
infection. We calibrate the model to the first wave of COVID-19 in the New York
metropolitan area, showing that it reproduces key epidemic and economic
statistics, and then examine counterfactual scenarios. We find that: (a) both
high fear of infection and strict restrictions similarly harm the economy but
reduce infections; (b) low-income workers bear the brunt of both the economic
and epidemic harm; (c) closing non-customer-facing industries such as
manufacturing and construction only marginally reduces the death toll while
considerably increasing unemployment; and (d) delaying the start of protective
measures does little to help the economy and worsens epidemic outcomes in all
scenarios. We anticipate that our model will help designing effective and
equitable non-pharmaceutical interventions that minimize disruptions in the

random walk on a connected regular graph with $n$ vertices is
$(1+o(1))\frac{3n^2}{2\pi^2}$. A conjecture by Guiduli and Mohar (1997)
predicts the structure of graphs whose algebraic connectivity $\mu$ is the
smallest among all connected graphs whose minimum degree $\delta$ is a given
$d$. We prove that this conjecture implies Aldous--Fill conjecture for odd $d$.
We pose another conjecture on the structure of $d$-regular graphs with minimum
$\mu$, and show that this also implies Aldous--Fill conjecture for even $d$. In
the literature, it has been noted empirically that graphs with small $\mu$ tend
to have a large diameter. Guiduli asked if the cubic graphs with maximum
diameter have algebraic connectivity smaller than all others. We investigate
the interplay between the graphs with maximum diameter and those with minimum
algebraic connectivity. We show that the answer to Guiduli problem in its
general form, that is for $d$-regular graphs for every $d\ge3$ is negative. We
try to come up with an asymptotic formulation of the problem. We prove that for
$d=3,4$, $d$-regular graphs with asymptotic maximum diameter have
asymptotically smallest $\mu$. It is shown that this fails for $d$-regular

conjecture that $d$-regular graphs (or graphs with $\delta=d$) that have

above results rely heavily on our understanding of the structure as well as
optimal estimation of the algebraic connectivity of graphs with asymptotic
maximum diameter. As another by-product, we prove that the minimum algebraic
connectivity of $d$-regular graphs of order $n$ or graphs with $\delta=d$ is
$\Theta(d/n^2)$, and also settle Aldous--Fill conjecture for graphs with

have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very
simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes
are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far
from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with
many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we
introduce the Face Interaction Graph Network (FIGNet) which extends beyond
GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than
nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around
4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more
computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn
frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate
than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet
represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains
which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied

Determining the volume change of tessellation cells yields the divergence of
the particle velocity. Reorganizing the various velocity coefficients allows
computing the curl and even the velocity gradient tensor. The helicity of

inferred from fits to three stellar streams generated by the globular clusters
NGC 3201, M68 (NGC 4590), and Palomar 5. Observational constraints on the
gravitational potential from the stellar distribution, rotation curve, vertical
velocity dispersion, and distant Milky Way satellites are included. We model
the dark halo density profile as an axisymmetric two power-law model with axis
ratio $q_\rho^{\rm h}$ and four additional free parameters for the radial
profile. The stream of NGC 3201 alone barely constrains the halo axis ratio.
The Palomar 5 stream constrains the halo to be close to spherical with
$q_\rho^{\rm h}=1.01\pm0.09$. The stream of M68 is also consistent with a
spherical halo but favours a prolate configuration of $q_\rho^{\rm
h}=1.14^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$. The three streams together are well fitted with a
halo axis ratio $q_\rho^{\rm h}=1.06\pm0.06$ and core radius $\sim$ 20 kpc. Our
estimate of the halo oblateness agrees with previous studies using other
observational data and is in tension with cosmological simulations predicting
that most spiral galaxies have oblate dark matter halos with the short axis
perpendicular to the disc. We discuss the impact of the tidal perturbation of
the Magellanic Clouds, which we assume too small to change the conclusion on
the axis ratio at the radii where we probe it. We note that dynamical
equilibrium of a spherical halo in the presence of the disc potential implies
an anisotropic dark matter velocity dispersion tensor with larger dispersion in
the vertical direction than the horizontal ones, which should relate back to
the assembly history of the Milky Way.

two-stage scheme. The general idea is to first generate class-agnostic region
proposals and then feed the cropped proposal regions to CLIP to utilize its
image-level zero-shot classification capability. While effective, such a scheme
requires two image encoders, one for proposal generation and one for CLIP,
leading to a complicated pipeline and high computational cost. In this work, we
pursue a simpler-and-efficient one-stage solution that directly extends CLIP's
zero-shot prediction capability from image to pixel level. Our investigation
starts with a straightforward extension as our baseline that generates semantic
masks by comparing the similarity between text and patch embeddings extracted
from CLIP. However, such a paradigm could heavily overfit the seen classes and
fail to generalize to unseen classes. To handle this issue, we propose three
simple-but-effective designs and figure out that they can significantly retain
the inherent zero-shot capacity of CLIP and improve pixel-level generalization
ability. Incorporating those modifications leads to an efficient zero-shot
semantic segmentation system called ZegCLIP. Through extensive experiments on
three public benchmarks, ZegCLIP demonstrates superior performance,
outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin under both
""inductive"" and ""transductive"" zero-shot settings. In addition, compared with
the two-stage method, our one-stage ZegCLIP achieves a speedup of about 5 times
faster during inference. We release the code at

second is a nearest-neighbour algorithm, which focuses on finding the AGB model

In the second algorithm we include the error bars and observational
uncertainties to find the best fit model. The classification process is based
on the abundances of Fe, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ru, Nd, Ce, Sm, and Eu. We selected these
elements by systematically removing s-process elements from our AGB model
abundance distributions, and identifying those whose removal has the biggest
positive effect on the classification. We excluded Nb, Y, Mo, and La. Our final
classification combines the output of both algorithms to identify for each Ba
star companion an initial mass and metallicity range. With our analysis tools
we identify the main properties for 166 of the 169 Ba stars in the stellar
sample. The classifications based on both stellar sets of AGB final abundances
show similar distributions, with an average initial mass of M = 2.23 MSun and
2.34 MSun and an average [Fe/H] = -0.21 and -0.11, respectively. We
investigated why the removal of Nb, Y, Mo, and La improves our classification

that these stars have statistically significant different abundances for these

data of unresolved (point) sources, we can derive the MRS absolute spectral
response function (ASRF) starting from raw data. Spectral fringing plays a
critical role in the derivation and interpretation of the MRS ASRF. In this
paper, we present an alternative way to calibrate the data. Firstly, we aim to
derive a fringe correction that accounts for the dependence of the fringe
properties on the MIRI pupil illumination and detector pixel sampling of the
point spread function. Secondly, we aim to derive the MRS ASRF using an
absolute flux calibrator observed across the full 5 to 28 $\mu$m wavelength

the detectability of molecular features in the G dwarf and K giant. The
absolute flux calibrator HD 163466 (A-star) is used to derive tailored point
source fringe flats at each of the default dither locations of the MRS. The
fringe-corrected point source integrated spectrum of HD 163466 is used to
derive the MRS ASRF using a theoretical model for the stellar continuum. A
cross-correlation is run to quantify the uncertainty on the detection of CO,
SiO, and OH in the K giant and CO in the G dwarf for different fringe
corrections. The point-source-tailored fringe correction and ASRF are found to
perform at the same level as the current corrections, beating down the fringe
contrast to the sub-percent level, whilst mitigating the alteration of real
molecular features. The same tailored solutions can be applied to other MRS
unresolved targets. A pointing repeatability issue in the MRS limits the
effectiveness of the tailored fringe flats is at short wavelengths.

distinction of two convexity concepts, M-convexity and L-convexity, for
functions in integer or binary variables, together with their conjugacy
relationship. The crucial fact is that M-concavity, or its variant called
M-natural-concavity, is equivalent to the (gross) substitutes property in
economics. Fundamental theorems in discrete convex analysis such as the M-L

Online Feedback Optimization controller that minimizes the compressor station
power consumption. In the evaluated scenario, imperfect knowledge of the plant
leads to a 5\% increase in power consumption compared to the case with perfect

eccentricity damping formulas have only been derived at high viscosities,
ignoring partial gap opening. We aim at obtaining a simple formula to model
$e$-damping of the type-I regime in low viscosity discs, where even small
planets may start opening partial. We perform high resolution 2D locally
isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses on fixed
orbits in discs with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We determine the
torque and power felt by the planet to derive migration and eccentricity
damping timescales. We first find a lower limit to the gap depths below which
vortices appear; this happens roughly at the transition between type-I and
type-II regimes. For the simulations that remain stable, we obtain a fit to the
observed gap depth in the limit of vanishing eccentricities that is similar to
the one currently used in the literature but is accurate down to
$\alpha=3.16\times 10^{-5}$. We record the $e$-damping efficiency as a function
of the observed gap depth and $e$: when the planet has opened a deep enough
gap, a linear trend is observed independently of $e$; at shallower gaps this
linear trend is preserved at low $e$, while it deviates to more efficient
damping when $e$ is comparable to the disc's scale height. Both trends can be
understood on theoretical grounds and are reproduced by a simple fitting
formula. Our combined fits yield a simple recipe to implement type-I
$e$-damping in $N$-body for partial gap opening planets that is consistent with
high-resolution 2D hydro-simulations. The typical error of the fit is of the
order of a few percent, and lower than the error of type-I torque formulas
widely used in the literature. This will allow a more self-consistent treatment
of planet-disc interactions of the type-I regime for population synthesis
models at low viscosities.

  with hyperviscosity",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The Kolmogorov-Yaglom (third-order) law, links energy transfer rates in the
inertial range of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with third-order
structure functions. Anisotropy, a typical property in the solar wind, largely
challenges the applicability of the third-order law with isotropic assumption.
To shed light on the energy transfer process in the presence of anisotropy, the
present study conducted direct numerical simulations (DNSs) on forced MHD
turbulence with normal and hyper-viscosity under various strengths of the
external magnetic field ($B_0$), and calculated three forms of third-order
structure function with or without averaging azimuthal or polar angles to $B_0$
direction. Correspondingly, three forms of estimated energy transfer rates were
studied systematically with various $B_0$. The result shows that the peak of
the estimated longitudinal transfer rate occurs at larger scales as closer to
the $B_0$ direction, and its maximum shifts away from the $B_0$ direction at
larger $B_0$. Compared with normal viscous cases, hyper-viscous cases can
attain better separation of the inertial range from the dissipation range, thus
facilitating the analyses of the inertial range properties and the estimation
of the energy cascade rates. The direction-averaged third-order structure
function over a spherical surface proposed in literature predicts the energy
transfer rates and inertial range accurately, even at very high $B_0$. With
limited statistics, the calculation of the third-order structure function shows
a stronger dependence on averaging of azimuthal angles than the time,
especially at high $B_0$ cases. These findings provide insights into the
anisotropic effect on the estimation of energy transfer rates.

head pose. Based on the prior of equal side length, we can effortlessly obtain

applying the error-prone PnP algorithm. In experiments, our proposed method

Phys",,"10.1039/D2CP04253C",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Transport of tracer particles through mesh-like environments such as
biological hydrogels and polymer matrices is ubiquitous in nature. These
tracers could be passive, such as colloids or active (self-propelled), such as
synthetic nanomotors or bacteria. Computer simulations in principle should be
extremely useful in exploring the mechanism of active (self-propelled)
transport of tracer particles through the mesh-like environments. Therefore, we
construct a polymer network on a diamond lattice and use computer simulations
to investigate the dynamics of spherical self-propelled particles inside the
network. Our main objective is to elucidate the effect of the self-propulsion
on the dynamics of the tracer particle as a function of tracer size and
stiffness of the polymer network. We compute the time-averaged mean-squared
displacement (MSD) and the van-Hove correlations of the tracer. On one hand, in
the case of the bigger sticky particle, caging caused by the network particles
wins over the escape assisted by the self-propulsion. This results
intermediate-time subdiffusion. On the other hand, smaller tracers or tracers
with high self-propulsion velocities can easily escape from the cages and show
intermediate-time superdiffusion. Stiffer the network, slower the dynamics of
the tracer, and the bigger tracers exhibit longer lived intermediate time
superdiffusion, as the persistence time scales as $\sim \sigma^3$, where
$\sigma$ is the diameter of the tracer. In intermediate time, non-Gaussianity
is more pronounced for active tracers. In the long time, the dynamics of the
tracer, if passive or weakly active, becomes Gaussian and diffusive, but
remains flat for tracers with high self-propulsion, accounting for their
seemingly unrestricted motion inside the network.

displaying a representation of collected collision data (particle trajectories,
clusters and calorimeter towers) called the Event Display. The Event Display is
constantly running in the ALICE Run Control Center as part of the Quality
Assurance system, providing the monitoring personnel with visual cues about
possible problems of both hardware and software components during periods of
data gathering. In the software, particle trajectories (which are curved due to
presence of magnetic field inside the detector) are generated from physical
parameters of detected particles, such as electrical charge and momentum.
Previously this process in the Event Display used a uniform, constant magnetic
field for these calculations, which differs from the spatial variations of the
real magnetic field and does not model one of the two magnets used in the
detector. Recently, a detailed model of ALICE magnetic field was made available
as a shader program for execution on the GPU. In this work we attempt to
implement the reconstruction algorithm in a shader form as well, allowing us to
combine it with the detailed model to create a full solution for rendering
trajectories from collision event data directly on the GPU. This approach has
several possible advantages, such as better performance and the ability to
alter the magnetic field properties in real-time. This was not previously done
for ALICE and as such could be used in the future to upgrade the Event Display.

  arXiv:2211.13926",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Low-dose computed tomography (CT) plays a significant role in reducing the
radiation risk in clinical applications. However, lowering the radiation dose
will significantly degrade the image quality. With the rapid development and
wide application of deep learning, it has brought new directions for the
development of low-dose CT imaging algorithms. Therefore, we propose a fully
unsupervised one sample diffusion model (OSDM)in projection domain for low-dose
CT reconstruction. To extract sufficient prior information from single sample,
the Hankel matrix formulation is employed. Besides, the penalized weighted
least-squares and total variation are introduced to achieve superior image
quality. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on one
sinogram by extracting a great number of tensors from the structural-Hankel
matrix as the network input to capture prior distribution. Then, at the
inference stage, the stochastic differential equation solver and data
consistency step are performed iteratively to obtain the sinogram data.
Finally, the final image is obtained through the filtered back-projection
algorithm. The reconstructed results are approaching to the normal-dose
counterparts. The results prove that OSDM is practical and effective model for
reducing the artifacts and preserving the image quality.

latitude regions and a 360{\textdegree} wide viewing angle, NeRF's general ray
sampling strategy is ineffective. Hence, the view synthesis accuracy of NeRF is
limited and learning is not efficient. We propose two non-uniform ray sampling
schemes for NeRF to suit 360{\textdegree} images - distortion-aware ray
sampling and content-aware ray sampling. We created an evaluation dataset
Synth360 using Replica and SceneCity models of indoor and outdoor scenes,
respectively. In experiments, we show that our proposal successfully builds
360{\textdegree} image NeRF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The
proposal is widely applicable to advanced variants of NeRF. DietNeRF, AugNeRF,
and NeRF++ combined with the proposed techniques further improve the
performance. Moreover, we show that our proposed method enhances the quality of
real-world scenes in 360{\textdegree} images. Synth360:

stabilization in turbulent environments by extending its four outrigger hulls.
Second, a real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is
proposed for all shapes of the TransBoat to enhance its maneuverability and
resist disturbance to its movement, based on a nonlinear dynamic model. An
experimental approach is proposed to identify the parameters of the dynamic
model, and a subsequent trajectory tracking test validates the dynamics, NMPC

performance in the expanded form of the TransBoat compared with the contracted

generalization to CLIP model. Since training on a similar scale for videos is
infeasible, recent approaches focus on the effective transfer of image-based
CLIP to the video domain. In this pursuit, new parametric modules are added to
learn temporal information and inter-frame relationships which require
meticulous design efforts. Furthermore, when the resulting models are learned
on videos, they tend to overfit on the given task distribution and lack in
generalization aspect. This begs the following question: How to effectively
transfer image-level CLIP representations to videos? In this work, we show that
a simple Video Fine-tuned CLIP (ViFi-CLIP) baseline is generally sufficient to
bridge the domain gap from images to videos. Our qualitative analysis
illustrates that the frame-level processing from CLIP image-encoder followed by
feature pooling and similarity matching with corresponding text embeddings
helps in implicitly modeling the temporal cues within ViFi-CLIP. Such
fine-tuning helps the model to focus on scene dynamics, moving objects and
inter-object relationships. For low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is not
viable, we propose a `bridge and prompt' approach that first uses fine-tuning
to bridge the domain gap and then learns prompts on language and vision side to
adapt CLIP representations. We extensively evaluate this simple yet strong
baseline on zero-shot, base-to-novel generalization, few-shot and fully

reddening map in the cluster direction, which allowed us to correct the
evolutionary sequences in the color magnitude diagram (CMD) for the effects of
differential reddening. A comparison between the CMDs of NGC 6316 and 47
Tucanae revealed strikingly similar stellar populations, with the two systems
basically sharing the same turn-off, sub-giant branch, and horizontal branch
morphologies, indicating comparable ages. The red giant branch in NGC 6316
appears slightly bluer than in 47 Tucanae, suggesting a lower metal content.
This has been confirmed by the isochrone fitting of the observed CMD, which
provided us with updated values of the cluster age, distance, average color
excess, and metallicity. We estimated an absolute age of 13.1 $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr,
consistent with the age of 47 Tucanae, an average color excess E(B-V) = 0.64
$\pm$ 0.01, and a true distance modulus (m-M)0 = 15.27 $\pm$ 0.03 that sets the
cluster distance at 11.3 kpc from the Sun. In addition, the photometric
estimate of the cluster metallicity suggests [Fe/H]$\approx$ -0.9, which is
$\sim$ 0.2 dex smaller than that of 47 Tucanae. We also determined the
gravitational center and the density profile of the system from resolved stars.
The latter is well reproduced by a King model. Our results confirm that NGC

source domain data and unlabeled target domain data to obtain a promising
generalizable decision boundary. However, it is usually difficult for these
methods to achieve a perfect domain-invariant liveness feature disentanglement,
which may degrade the final classification performance by domain differences in
illumination, face category, spoof type, etc. In this work, we tackle
cross-scenario face anti-spoofing by proposing a novel domain adaptation method
called cyclically disentangled feature translation network (CDFTN).
Specifically, CDFTN generates pseudo-labeled samples that possess: 1) source
domain-invariant liveness features and 2) target domain-specific content
features, which are disentangled through domain adversarial training. A robust
classifier is trained based on the synthetic pseudo-labeled images under the
supervision of source domain labels. We further extend CDFTN for multi-target
domain adaptation by leveraging data from more unlabeled target domains.
Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
approach significantly outperforms the state of the art.

  SRDA",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has recently gained attention in atmospheric and oceanic
sciences for its potential to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations and
reduce computational costs. Super-resolution is one such technique, which
obtains high-resolution inference from low-resolution data. This paper proposes
a new data assimilation scheme, called four-dimensional super-resolution data
assimilation (4D-SRDA). This framework calculates the time evolution of a
system from low-resolution simulations by an atmospheric or ocean model,
whereas a trained neural network simultaneously performs data assimilation and
spatio-temporal super-resolution. The use of low-resolution simulations without
ensemble members reduces the computational cost of obtaining high-resolution
predictions in space and time. In 4D-SRDA, fluid simulations and neural-network
inferences are conducted alternately, which can lead to domain shifts, i.e.,
statistical differences in forecast states between the training and testing
phases. Such domain shifts may reduce the accuracy of inferences. To enhance
the robustness of inferences in 4D-SRDA, super-resolution mixup (SR-mixup) is
developed, which is a data augmentation method for domain generalization.
SR-mixup creates a linear combination of randomly sampled inputs, which
virtually follows different distributions from the original data. The validity
of 4D-SRDA and SR-mixup is demonstrated through numerical experiments of an
idealized barotropic ocean jet with supervised learning. The results suggest
that the combination of 4D-SRDA and SR-mixup is useful for robust inference,
particularly when observation points are spatially sparse. This research
indicates the potential of super-resolution and domain generalization
techniques, in terms of data assimilation, for the future integration of
machine learning and physics-based models.

RNA sequencing data, samples often come from a mixture of different populations
and each population has its own unique network. Available graphical models
often assume that all samples are from the same population and share the same
network. One has to first cluster the samples and use available methods to
infer the network for every cluster separately. However, this two-step
procedure ignores uncertainty in the clustering step and thus could lead to
inaccurate network estimation. Motivated by these applications, we consider the
mixture Poisson log-normal model for network inference of count data from mixed
populations. The latent precision matrices of the mixture model correspond to
the networks of different populations and can be jointly estimated by
maximizing the lasso-penalized log-likelihood. Under rather mild conditions, we
show that the mixture Poisson log-normal model is identifiable and has the
positive definite Fisher information matrix. Consistency of the maximum
lasso-penalized log-likelihood estimator is also established. To avoid the
intractable optimization of the log-likelihood, we develop an algorithm called
VMPLN based on the variational inference method. Comprehensive simulation and
real single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses demonstrate the superior
performance of VMPLN.

The main contribution of this paper is circumventing tedious probabilistic

followed by a multiplication operator defined by $e^{r}$. It turns out that
even if the observable/ reward function is unbounded, but for some for some

simulations were performed to evaluate the degree of protein adsorption on the
self-assembled monolayer terminated with two hydrophilic OH groups ((OH)2-SAM)
at the packing densities ({\Sigma}) of 4.5 nm-2 and 6.5 nm-2, respectively. The
results show that the (OH)2-SAM itself can significantly improve the
performance of its resistance to protein adsorption. This is attributed to the
structure of the (OH)2-SAM itself, i.e., the formation of a nearly perfect
hexagonal-ice-like hydrogen bond structure in the OH matrix of the (OH)2-SAM at
{\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2, which sharply reduces the number of hydrogen bonds (i.e.,
0.9) formed between the hydrophobic (OH)2-SAM surface and protein. While for
{\Sigma} = 6.5 nm-2, the hydrophilic (OH)2-SAM surface can provide more
hydrogen bonding sites to form hydrogen bonds (i.e., 7.3) with protein. The
number of hydrogen bonds formed between the (OH)2-SAM and protein at {\Sigma} =
6.5 nm-2 is ~8 times higher than that at {\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2, reflecting the
excellent resistance to protein adsorption exhibited by the structure of
(OH)2-SAM itself at {\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2. Compared with traditionally physical
barrier effect formed by a large number of hydrogen bonds between the (OH)2-SAM
and water above at {\Sigma} = 6.5 nm-2, the structure of the (OH)2-SAM itself

thereby exhibiting a protocol secure against a linear amount of entanglement

the qubit travels arbitrarily slow in an optical fiber. We also extend this
analysis to the case of more than two bases, showing even stronger

interacts with its environment in an open quantum system. One of the essential
characteristics of a Markovian process is that it can be arbitrarily divided
into two or more legitimate completely-positive (CP) subprocesses (i.e., the
main process has CP-divisibility). However, when at least one non-CP process
exists among the divided processes, the dynamics is said to be non-Markovian.
Herein, we propose two experimentally feasible methods for identifying
non-Markovianity based on CP-divisibility. The first method is based on the
non-Markovian process robustness, which proves that non-Markovianity can be
treated as a quantum process capability and quantitatively characterizes the
ability of a non-CP process to endure a minimum amount of CP operations
required to become a CP process, where this non-CP process is determined by
quantum process tomography (QPT) and inverse matrix calculation. The second
method provides an efficient approach for identifying non-Markovian dynamics by
tomographically analyzing a minimum of just two system output states of the
dynamical process without the need for QPT. We demonstrate that both methods
can be implemented using all-optical setups and can be applied to analyze the
non-Markovianity of single-photon and two-photon dynamics in birefringent
crystals. They also can be used to explore non-Markovianity and the related
effects on quantum-information processing in other dynamical systems where

Solving these modern causal questions requires tackling violations of many

classical no-interference assumption, meaning that the treatment of one
individuals might affect the outcomes of another. To make interference
tractable, we consider a known network that describes how interference may
travel. However, unlike previous work in this area, the radius (and intensity)
of the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on
different sub-networks of those treated and untreated that are connected to
this unit.
  We study estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated in
such a setting. The proposed estimator builds upon a Lepski-like procedure that
searches over the possible relevant radii and treatment assignment patterns. In
contrast to previous work, the proposed procedure aims to approximate the
relevant network interference patterns. We establish oracle inequalities and
corresponding adaptive rates for the estimation of the interference function.
We leverage such estimates to propose and analyze two estimators for the
average direct treatment effect on the treated. We address several challenges

with decision diagrams. We present a relatively simple decision diagram
operation called REACH that also computes fixpoints. In contrast to saturation,
it does not require a partitioning of the transition relation. We give
sequential algorithms implementing the new operation for both binary and
multi-valued decision diagrams, and moreover provide parallel counterparts. We
implement these algorithms and experimentally compare their performance against
saturation on 692 model checking benchmarks in different languages. The results
show that the REACH operation often outperforms saturation, especially on
transition relations with low locality. In a comparison between parallelized
versions of REACH and saturation we find that REACH obtains comparable speedups
up to 16 cores, although falls behind saturation at 64 cores. Finally, in a
comparison with the state-of-the-art model checking tool ITS-tools we find that
REACH outperforms ITS-tools on 29% of models, suggesting that REACH can be
useful as a complementary method in an ensemble tool.

amounts of time. Tracking such groups is an important analysis task in a
variety of areas, such as wildlife ecology, urban transport, or sports

identify and track meaningful groups in sets of moving entities. However, not
only the mere existence of one or more groups is an important fact to discover;
in many application areas the actual shape of the group carries meaning as
well. In this paper we initiate the algorithmic study of the shape of a moving
group. We use kernel density estimation to model the density within a group and
show how to efficiently maintain an approximation of this density description
over time. Furthermore, we track persistent maxima which give a meaningful
first idea of the time-varying shape of the group. By combining several
approximation techniques, we obtain a kinetic data structure that can
approximately track persistent maxima efficiently.

the M4 mission in ESA ""Cosmic Vision"" program, with launch expected in 2029.
The mission will operate from the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point L2. The scientific
payload consists of two instruments: a high resolution spectrometer in the
waveband 1.95-7.8 microns, and a fine guidance system / visible photometer /
low resolution near-infrared spectrometer. The instruments are fed a collimated
beam from an unobscured, off-axis Cassegrain telescope. Instruments and
telescope will operate at a temperature below 50 K. Telescope mirrors and
supporting structures will be realized in aerospace-grade aluminum. Given the
large aperture of the primary mirror (0.6 m$^2$), it is a choice of material
that requires careful optical and opto-mechanical design, and technological
advances in the three areas of mirror substrate thermal stabilization, optical
surface polishing and optical coating. This thesis presents the work done by
the author in these areas, as member of the team responsible for designing and
manufacturing the telescope and mirrors, starting with a systematic review of
the optical and opto-mechanical requirements and design choices of the Ariel
telescope, in the context of previous development work and scientific goals and
requirements of the mission. The review then progresses with opto-mechanical
design, examining the most important choices in terms of structural and thermal
design, and with a statistical analysis of the deformations of the optical
surface of the telescope mirrors and of their alignment in terms of rigid body
motions. The details of the qualification work on thermal stabilization,
polishing and coating are then presented.

concurrent programs more quickly, by executing a program backwards from the
point where a misbehaviour was observed, and looking for the bug(s) that caused
it. Reversible debuggers can be founded on the well-studied theory of
causal-consistent reversibility, which only allows one to undo an action
provided that its consequences, if any, are undone beforehand.
Causal-consistent reversibility yields more efficient debugging by reducing the
number of states to be explored when looking backwards. Till now,
causal-consistent reversibility has never considered time, which is a key
aspect in real-world applications. Here, we study the interplay between
reversibility and time in concurrent systems via a process algebra. The
Temporal Process Language (TPL) by Hennessy and Regan is a well-understood
extension of CCS with discrete-time and a timeout operator. We define revTPL, a
reversible extension of TPL, and we show that it satisfies the properties
expected from a causal-consistent reversible calculus. We show that,
alternatively, revTPL can be interpreted as an extension of reversible CCS with

Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face

multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical
tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this paper, we
address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point
clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor
modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we
propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately
perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar
Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which
replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the
contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer
to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and
downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial
relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the
RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse
environments, even without exploiting temporal information.

This model allows numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger

electronic correlation. We find the level structure of the system and the
spatial distribution of the electronic density for several states including
AIS. Studying the HHG efficiency as a function of the detuning from the
resonances with AIS we find the HHG enhancement lines. The shapes of these
lines are different from the corresponding Fano lines in the photoelectronic
spectra, in agreement with the experimental studies in helium. Moreover, we
simulate HHG under the conditions when the fundamental frequency is close to
the even-order multiphoton resonance with the dark AIS. We find the enhanced
generation of the neighbouring odd harmonics. The details of the enhancement
lines for these harmonics can be understood taking into account the temporal
delay between the emission of the non-resonant and resonant XUV; this delay is
defined by the AIS lifetime. Finally, our simulations show that the HHG

known to be superdiffusive, with dynamical spin correlations that are
conjectured to fall into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.
However, integrable spin chains have time-reversal and parity symmetries that
are absent from the KPZ/stochastic Burgers equation, which force higher-order
spin fluctuations to deviate from standard KPZ predictions. We put forward a
non-linear fluctuating hydrodynamic theory consisting of two coupled stochastic
modes: the local spin magnetization and the local imbalance between right and
left-moving giant quasiparticles. Our theory fully explains the emergence of
anomalous spin dynamics in isotropic chains: it predicts KPZ scaling for the
spin structure factor, but with a symmetric, quasi-Gaussian, distribution of
spin fluctuations. We substantiate our results using matrix-product states
calculations.

data points are naturally grouped (e.g., survey responses grouped by state) and

input-output patterns are related across the groups. To model the inherent

invariance across groups, defined in terms of the group-agnostic feature space.
We demonstrate that under this assumption, the group carries additional
information about the class, over the group-agnostic features, with provably
improved area under the ROC curve. Further assuming invariance of
partition-projected class-conditional distributions across both labeled and
unlabeled data, we derive a semi-supervised algorithm that explicitly leverages
the structure to learn an optimal, group-aware, probability-calibrated

process by selectively triggering interventions at runtime (e.g., offering a
discount to a customer) to increase the probability of a desired case outcome
(e.g., a customer making a purchase). The backbone of a prescriptive process
monitoring method is an intervention policy, which determines for which cases
and when an intervention should be executed. Existing methods in this field
rely on predictive models to define intervention policies; specifically, they
consider policies that trigger an intervention when the estimated probability
of a negative outcome exceeds a threshold. However, the probabilities computed
by a predictive model may come with a high level of uncertainty (low
confidence), leading to unnecessary interventions and, thus, wasted effort.
This waste is particularly problematic when the resources available to execute
interventions are limited. To tackle this shortcoming, this paper proposes an
approach to extend existing prescriptive process monitoring methods with
so-called conformal predictions, i.e., predictions with confidence guarantees.
An empirical evaluation using real-life public datasets shows that conformal
predictions enhance the net gain of prescriptive process monitoring methods
under limited resources.

of this type describe all degree $p$ (cyclic) Galois extensions over any

Galois action. If $\theta$ is a root then $\sigma(\theta) = \theta + 1$
generates the Galois group. Less well known, but equally general, is the so
called ""differential crossed product"" Azumaya algebra generated by $x,y$
subject to the relation $xy - yx = 1$. In characteristic $p$ these algebras are
always Azumaya and algebras of this sort generate the $p$ torsion subgroup of
the Brauer group of any commutative ring (of characteristic $p$).
  It is not possible for there to be descriptions this general in mixed
characteristic $0,p$ but we can come close. In Galois theory we define degree
$p$ Galois extensions with Galois action $\sigma(\theta) = \rho\theta + 1$,
where $\rho$ is a primitive $p$ root of one. The Azumaya algebra analog is
generated by $x,y$ subject to the relations $xy - \rho{y}x = 1$.
  The strength of the above constructions can be codified by lifting results.
We get characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$ surjectivity for degree $p$
Galois extensions and exponent $p$ Brauer group elements in quite general
circumstances. Obviously we want to get similar results for degree $p^n$ cyclic

we show that the BH scattering reflection and transmission coefficients
characterizing the continuous spectrum can be fully determined via a moment

measurements, usually referred to as 3$\times$2pt, had to discard a lot of
signal-to-noise from small scales due to our inability to accurately model
non-linearities and baryonic effects. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, or the
position-shear correlation between lens and source galaxies, is one of the
three two-point correlation functions that are included in such analyses,
usually estimated with the mean tangential shear. However, tangential shear
measurements at a given angular scale $\theta$ or physical scale $R$ carry
information from all scales below that, forcing the scale cuts applied in real
data to be significantly larger than the scale at which theoretical
uncertainties become problematic. Recently there have been a few independent
efforts that aim to mitigate the non-locality of the galaxy-galaxy lensing
signal. Here we perform a comparison of the different methods, including the
Y-transformation, the Point-Mass marginalization methodology and the Annular
Differential Surface Density statistic. We do the comparison at the
cosmological constraints level in a combined galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis. We find that all the estimators yield
equivalent cosmological results assuming a simulated Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Year 1 like setup and also when applied to DES
Y3 data. With the LSST Y1 setup, we find that the mitigation schemes yield
$\sim$1.3 times more constraining $S_8$ results than applying larger scale cuts
without using any mitigation scheme.

Results on two large-scale industrial mining complexes show a reduction of up

the inverse of latent period as control parameter, over 70% of the interval
comprises the coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors, bistable
dynamics. Despite the competition between these attractors, the chaotic ones
are preferred. The bistability occurs in two wide regions. One of these regions
is limited by periodic attractors, while periodic and chaotic attractors bound
the other. As the boundary of the second bistable region is composed of
periodic and chaotic attractors, it is possible to interpret these critical
points as tipping points. In other words, depending on the latent period, a
periodic attractor (predictability) can evolve to a chaotic attractor
(unpredictability). Therefore, we show that unpredictability is associated with
bistable dynamics preferably chaotic, and, furthermore, there is a tipping
point associated with unpredictable dynamics.

Nonetheless, because of the limited size of the training datasets, these models

ability to be reliable in these various unknown environments is called domain
generalization.
  Despite its importance, domain generalization is relatively unexplored in the

transformers for body pose estimation from various aspects, namely simplicity
in model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training
paradigm, and transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple
baseline model dubbed ViTPose. Specifically, ViTPose employs the plain and
non-hierarchical vision transformer as an encoder to encode features and a
lightweight decoder to decode body keypoints in either a top-down or a
bottom-up manner. It can be scaled up from about 20M to 1B parameters by taking
advantage of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of the vision
transformer, setting a new Pareto front for throughput and performance.
Besides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input
resolution, and pre-training and fine-tuning strategy. Based on the
flexibility, a novel ViTPose+ model is proposed to deal with heterogeneous body
keypoint categories in different types of body pose estimation tasks via
knowledge factorization, i.e., adopting task-agnostic and task-specific
feed-forward networks in the transformer. We also empirically demonstrate that
the knowledge of large ViTPose models can be easily transferred to small ones
via a simple knowledge token. Experimental results show that our ViTPose model
outperforms representative methods on the challenging MS COCO Human Keypoint

the vaguely quantified fuzzy rough set (VQFRS) model. While this idea is
intuitive, the VQFRS model suffers from both theoretical flaws as well as from
suboptimal performance in applications. In this paper, we improve on VQFRS by
introducing fuzzy quantifier-based fuzzy rough sets (FQFRS), an intuitive

fraud analytical methods and propose a keywording strategy for future research.
One of the key challenges in fraud analytics is access to public datasets. To
further aid the community, we provide eight requirements for suitable data sets

setup strongly affects the generalization performance. A key element of
reliable optimization for these systems is the modification of the loss

function to guide descent methods towards flatter minima, which arguably have
better generalization abilities. In this paper, we focus on a variant of SAM
known as mSAM, which, during training, averages the updates generated by
adversarial perturbations across several disjoint shards of a mini-batch.
Recent work suggests that mSAM can outperform SAM in terms of test accuracy.
However, a comprehensive empirical study of mSAM is missing from the literature
-- previous results have mostly been limited to specific architectures and
datasets. To that end, this paper presents a thorough empirical evaluation of
mSAM on various tasks and datasets. We provide a flexible implementation of
mSAM and compare the generalization performance of mSAM to the performance of
SAM and vanilla training on different image classification and natural language
processing tasks. We also conduct careful experiments to understand the
computational cost of training with mSAM, its sensitivity to hyperparameters
and its correlation with the flatness of the loss landscape. Our analysis
reveals that mSAM yields superior generalization performance and flatter
minima, compared to SAM, across a wide range of tasks without significantly
increasing computational costs.

crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. While previous work has
made great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods
still suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all
regions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different
regions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to
capture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as
they typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space
for all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework
which enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both
spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning
paradigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with
temporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and
time. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our
ST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph
data at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic
graph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic
prediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation.
Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently
outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal
heterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may
also cast light on other spatial-temporal applications. Model implementation is
available at https://github.com/Echo-Ji/ST-SSL.

radiographic tool for monitoring SNF due to their highly penetrative nature and
high energy. Cosmic ray muons are more suitable and have been used for imaging
large and dense objects. Despite their potential in various applications, the
wide application of cosmic ray muons is limited by the naturally low intensity
at sea level. To efficiently utilize cosmic ray muons in engineering
applications, trajectory and momentum must be measured. Although various
studies demonstrate that there is significant potential for measuring momentum
in muon applications, it is still difficult to measure both muon scattering
angle and momentum in the field. To fill this critical gap, a muon spectrometer
using multilayer pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators was proposed. However,
existing muon tomographic algorithms were developed assuming monoenergetic muon
scattering and are not optimized for a measured polyenergetic momentum
spectrum. In this work, we develop and evaluate a momentum integrated muon

identify a missing fuel assembly from a SNF dry cask. Our results demonstrate
that image resolution using MMST is significantly improved when measuring muon

object detection in images but at the cost of requiring large labeled datasets.
To mitigate this cost, semi-supervised object detection methods, which consist
in leveraging abundant unlabeled data, have been proposed and have already
shown impressive results. However, most of these methods require linking a
pseudo-label to a ground-truth object by thresholding. In previous works, this
threshold value is usually determined empirically, which is time consuming, and
only done for a single data distribution. When the domain, and thus the data
distribution, changes, a new and costly parameter search is necessary. In this
work, we introduce our method Adaptive Self-Training for Object Detection
(ASTOD), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student method. ASTOD
determines without cost a threshold value based directly on the ground value of
the score histogram. To improve the quality of the teacher predictions, we also
propose a novel pseudo-labeling procedure. We use different views of the
unlabeled images during the pseudo-labeling step to reduce the number of missed

$c$-coloring such that each non-isolated vertex has a color appearing exactly
once on its neighborhood. Clearly, every proper conflict-free $c$-coloring is
an odd $c$-coloring. Cranston conjectured that every graph $G$ with
$\text{mad}(G) < \frac{4c}{c+2}$ has an odd $c$-coloring for $c \geq 4$, and
proved the conjecture for $c\in\{5, 6\}$. Note that the bound $\frac{4c}{c+2}$
is best possible. Cho et al. solved Cranston's conjecture for $c \geq 5$, and
strengthened the result from odd $c$-coloring to proper conflict-free
$c$-coloring, but they did not give all the extremal non-colorable graphs $G$

  For $c=4$, Cranston's conjecture is not true since a graph whose every block

$\text{mad}(G) < \frac{22}{9}$ and no induced $5$-cycles has an odd
$4$-coloring, we improve this result by proving that a graph $G$ with
$\text{mad}(G) \leq \frac{22}{9}$ (equality is allowed) is not odd
$4$-colorable if and only if $G$ belongs to a special class of graphs. On the
other hand, Cho et al. proved that a planar graph with girth at least $5$ has
an odd $6$-coloring, we improve it by proving that a planar graph without
$4^{-}$-cycles adjacent to $7^{-}$-cycles has an odd $6$-coloring.

prevalent rhythms in networks with an odd number of units. We denote such

first-order coupling. Astonishingly, the addition of the second or third

consider learning tasks given by conditional expectations $x \mapsto

is a potentially pathological transformation of some underlying data-generating

learning has been used to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the

selected feature sets and the distinct feature sets selected using four feature
selection models. The paper compares seven classifiers using each of the
sixteen feature sets. Originally, the data had 56 attributes and 303
occurrences, of which 87 were in good health, and the remainder had
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Demographic data with several features make up
the four groups of overall features. Lasso, Tree-based algorithms, Chi-Square
and RFE have all been used to choose the four distinct feature sets, each
containing five, ten, fifteen, and twenty features, respectively. Seven
distinct classifiers have been trained and evaluated for each of the sixteen
feature sets. To determine the most effective blend of feature set and model, a
total of 112 models have been trained, tested, and their performance has been
compared. SVM classifier with fifteen chosen features is shown to be the best
in terms of overall accuracy. The healthcare data has been maintained in the
cloud and would be accessible to patients, caretakers, and healthcare providers
through integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled smart
healthcare. Subsequently, the feature selection model chooses the most
appropriate feature for CVD prediction to calibrate the system, and the
proposed framework can be utilised to anticipate CVD.

Each ad impression generated from a user visit is auctioned in real time, where

However, the current bid strategy overlooks large randomness of the user

we propose a novel adaptive risk-aware bidding algorithm with budget constraint
via reinforcement learning, which is the first to simultaneously consider
estimation uncertainty and the dynamic risk tendency of a DSP. We theoretically
unveil the intrinsic relation between the uncertainty and the risk tendency

three essential properties and an adaptive learning method based on
