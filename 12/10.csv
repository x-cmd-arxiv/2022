decision rules that are unable to generalize -- undermining models'
reliability. Previous works address this problem under the tenuous assumption
that only a single shortcut exists in the training data. Real-world images are
rife with multiple visual cues from background to texture. Key to advancing the
reliability of vision systems is understanding whether existing methods can
overcome multiple shortcuts or struggle in a Whac-A-Mole game, i.e., where
mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. To address this
shortcoming, we propose two benchmarks: 1) UrbanCars, a dataset with precisely
controlled spurious cues, and 2) ImageNet-W, an evaluation set based on
ImageNet for watermark, a shortcut we discovered affects nearly every modern
vision model. Along with texture and background, ImageNet-W allows us to study
multiple shortcuts emerging from training on natural images. We find computer
vision models, including large foundation models -- regardless of training set,
architecture, and supervision -- struggle when multiple shortcuts are present.
Even methods explicitly designed to combat shortcuts struggle in a Whac-A-Mole
dilemma. To tackle this challenge, we propose Last Layer Ensemble, a
simple-yet-effective method to mitigate multiple shortcuts without Whac-A-Mole
behavior. Our results surface multi-shortcut mitigation as an overlooked
challenge critical to advancing the reliability of vision systems. The datasets
and code are released: https://github.com/facebookresearch/Whac-A-Mole.

  Pre-Basecalling Filtering",,,,,"q-bio.GN cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Basecalling is an essential step in nanopore sequencing analysis where the
raw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences,
i.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models
to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling
computationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome
analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no
match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are
discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling
computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first fast and
widely-applicable pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in
basecalling. TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the
target reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall
consists of two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network
basecaller that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels
each of these noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the
target reference. TargetCall filters out all off-target reads before
basecalling; and the highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on
the raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough
experimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that
TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance of the
state-of-the-art basecaller by 3.31x while maintaining high (98.88%)
sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in
downstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,
and 4) achieves better performance, sensitivity, and generality compared to
prior works. We freely open-source TargetCall at

  powder transport",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The dynamics of the transported powder determines the functionality and
safety of pneumatic conveying systems. The relation between the carrier gas
flow, induced by the flown-through geometry, and the powder flow pattern is not
clear yet for electrostatically charged particles. This paper highlights the
influence of relatively minor cross-sectional secondary flows and electrostatic
forces on the concentration and dynamics of the particles. To this end, direct
numerical simulations (DNS) capture the interaction of the continuous and
dispersed phases by a four-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian strategy. The
transport of weakly charged particles in channel flows, where turbopheresis
defines the particle concentration, is compared to duct flows, where additional
cross-sectional vortices form. For both geometries the Stokes number ($S\!t=8,
32$) and the electrical Stokes number ($S\!t_\mathrm{el}=[0, 1, 2, 4]\times
10^{-3}$) are varied, the turbulent carrier flow was fixed to $Re_\tau=360$.
The presented simulations demonstrate that secondary flows, for the same
$Re_\tau$, $S\!t$, and $S\!t_\mathrm{el}$, dampen the effect of particle
charge. In a duct flow, vortical secondary flows enhance the cross-sectional
particle mobility against the direction of electrostatic forces. Compared to a
duct flow, in a channel the wall-normal aerodynamic forces are weaker. Thus,
electrical forces dominate their transport; the local particle concentration at
the walls increases. Further, electrostatic charges cause a stronger
correlation between the gas and particle velocities. In conclusion, despite
being weak compared to the primary flow forces, secondary flow and
electrostatic forces drive particle dynamics during pneumatic transport.

We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to
observe PSR J0628+0909 in the frequency range from 1.0 to 1.5 GHz. We searched
for strong single pulses and looked for pulsed emission in the RRAT nulling
states. Polarisation profiles, the single-pulse energy distribution, and
waiting-time statistics were measured. The Faraday rotation measure and
dispersion measure values are updated with the current observation. The
single-pulse polarisation behaviours show great diversity, similar to the case
of pulsars. Based on the integrated pulse profile and single-pulse energy
statistics, we argue that continuous pulsar-like emission exists in addition to
the transient-like burst emission for PSR J0628+0909. We find that the pulse
waiting time is not correlated with the pulse energy and conclude that the

the radial density profile $\rho(r)$ and a sensitive spatial measure of

function, (2) encapsulates the fact that $U$ satisfies a hidden PDE that $\xi$
characterizes, and (3) promotes sparsity in $\xi$ using ideas from iteratively
reweighted least-squares. Further, PDE-LEARN can simultaneously learn from
several data sets, allowing it to incorporate results from multiple

processors and domain-specific accelerators. Its density, power, speed, and
reliability play a critical role in enhancing the overall system performance
and quality of service. Conventional volatile memories, including static
random-access memory (SRAM) and embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM)
in the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, have high
performance and good reliability. However, the inherent leakage in both SRAM
and eDRAM hinders further improvement towards smaller feature sizes and higher
energy efficiency. Although the emerging nonvolatile memories can eliminate the
leakage efficiently, the penalties of lower speed and degraded reliability are
significant. This article reveals a new opportunity towards leakage-free
volatile static memory beyond the known paradigms of existing volatile and
nonvolatile memories. By engineering a double-well energy landscape with the
assistance of a clamping voltage bias, leakage-free and refresh-free state
retention of volatile memory is achieved for the first time. This new memory is
highlighted by both the ultra-low leakage of nonvolatile memories and the
speed, energy, and reliability advantages of volatile memories. A
proof-of-concept memory is demonstrated using in-house anti-ferroelectric
field-effect transistors (AFeFETs), delivering an extrapolated endurance of
about 1012 cycles, a retention time of over 10 years, and no subthreshold
channel leakage current. Such a new concept of AFeFET-based memory enables an
improved balance between density, power, and reliability beyond all existing
memory solutions.

management as practitioners seek to forecast breakdowns in asset co-movements
which expose portfolios to rapid and devastating collapses in value. The
structure of these co-movements can be described as a graph where companies are
represented by nodes and edges capture correlations between their price
movements. Learning a timely indicator of co-movement breakdowns (manifested as
modifications in the graph structure) is central in understanding both
financial stability and volatility forecasting. We propose to use the edge
reconstruction accuracy of a graph auto-encoder (GAE) as an indicator for how
spatially homogeneous connections between assets are, which, based on financial
network literature, we use as a proxy to infer market volatility. Our
experiments on the S&P 500 over the 2015-2022 period show that higher GAE
reconstruction error values are correlated with higher volatility. We also show
that out-of-sample autoregressive modeling of volatility is improved by the
addition of the proposed measure. Our paper contributes to the literature of
machine learning in finance particularly in the context of understanding stock

transformations with uniformly sampling distortion strengths from a continuous

of electromagnetic waves excited at opposite sides of the cross section can
cause splitting of the whispering gallery modes. By studying

been established that the splitting value, which controls the energies of the

methods to detect and distinguish different quantum dynamics. A common
non-demolition approach is to couple an auxiliary system (ancilla) to the
target system, and to measure the ancilla only. By doing so, the target system
becomes an environment for the ancilla. Thus, different quantum dynamics of
target systems will correspond to different environment properties. Here, we
analytically study XX spin chains presenting different kinds of quantum
dynamics, namely localized, delocalized, and dephasing dynamics, and build
connections between Markovianity and non-Markovianity - the two most common
properties of an environment. For a qubit coupled to the XX chain, we derived
the reduced density matrix of the qubit through the projection method.
Furthermore, when dephasing noise was introduced to the XX chain, we
generalized the projection method by introducing an open-system interaction
picture - a modification of the Dirac interaction picture. By calculating the
reduced density matrix for the qubit analytically and numerically, we found
that the delocalized (localized) chain corresponds to the Markovian
(non-Markovian) bath when boundary effects are not considered, and the feature
of the chain with dephasing noise as a bath is dependent on the dephasing
strength. The three kinds of quantum dynamics can be distinguished by measuring

protoplanetary stages. We obtain the dispersion relation for density-wave
perturbations on a fluid composed of two phases (gas and dust) interacting
through the common gravitation field and the mutual drag force, and we find
that the stability threshold is determined by three parameters: the local
dust-to-gas density ratio, the dust relative temperature and the relevant
Stokes number. In a region of parameters space, where young protoplanetary
discs are likely to be found, the instability can be dust driven, occurring at
small wavelengths. In this regime, the Jeans mass is much smaller than the one

be a viable way to form planetary cores in protostellar discs, since their

formation of carbonaceous mantle on dust surface. H$_2$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$,
C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_3$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_8$ are considered as
the main fragments of the HAC photo-destruction. We simulated evolution of the
HAC grains under the physical conditions of two PDRs, the Orion Bar and the
Horsehead nebula. We estimated the production rates of the HAC fragments in gas
phase chemical reactions and compared them with the production rates of
fragments due to the HAC destruction. The latter rates may dominate under some
conditions, namely, at A$_V$=0.1 in both PDRs. We coupled our model with the
gas-grain chemical model MONACO and calculated abundances of observed small

fragments to chemistry is not enough to match the observed abundances, although
it increases the abundances by several orders of magnitude in the Orion Bar at
A$_V$=0.1. Additionally, we found that the process of carbonaceous mantle
formation on dust surface can be an inhibitor for the formation of observed
small hydrocarbons in PDRs.

previous works brings ambiguity during training, and thus causes inferior
visual results. Although this one-to-many mapping could be alleviated in part
by a two-stage framework (i.e., an audio-to-expression model followed by a

produced without enough information (e.g., emotions, wrinkles, etc.). In this
paper, we propose MemFace to complement the missing information with an
implicit memory and an explicit memory that follow the sense of the two stages
respectively. More specifically, the implicit memory is employed in the
audio-to-expression model to capture high-level semantics in the
audio-expression shared space, while the explicit memory is employed in the

properties, such as the star formation rate-stellar mass relation (the main
sequence) and the stellar mass-halo mass relation (SHMR). In principle, these
scaling relations could imply different star formation histories (SFHs) of
galaxies and different constraints on galaxy formation physics. In this paper,
we derive the SFHs of galaxies by assuming that they always follow the SHMRs at
different redshifts and use an empirical model to constrain key processes in
their baryon cycle. It is found that, besides cold accretion due to halo
growth, outflow of gas produced by stellar feedback has to be recycled to
sustain the derived SFHs of galaxies. The recycled fraction is strongly
affected by the baryon fraction in accreted low-mass haloes and the mass
loading factor which quantifies the ratio between the galactic outflow rate and
star formation rate. Our fiducial model predicts that around $20-60\%$ of
outflow is recycled in $\sim0.5-4Gyrs$, while simulations predict a slightly
higher recycle fraction and a lower recycle time. We argue that strong
constraints on the baryon cycle process can be obtained from future observation
of the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of galaxies, such as the gas cooling rate
of CGM. We also find that the implied SFHs from the SHMRs indicate that
galaxies stay on the main sequences only for part of their lifetimes. Our model
reproduces the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation as well.

learning on graphs. The large data sizes of graphs and their vertex features

Since the convolution operation on graphs induces irregular memory access
patterns, designing a memory- and communication-efficient parallel algorithm
for GCN training poses unique challenges. We propose a highly parallel training
algorithm that scales to large processor counts. In our solution, the large
adjacency and vertex-feature matrices are partitioned among processors. We
exploit the vertex-partitioning of the graph to use non-blocking point-to-point
communication operations between processors for better scalability. To further
minimize the parallelization overheads, we introduce a sparse matrix
partitioning scheme based on a hypergraph partitioning model for full-batch
training. We also propose a novel stochastic hypergraph model to encode the
expected communication volume in mini-batch training. We show the merits of the
hypergraph model, previously unexplored for GCN training, over the standard
graph partitioning model which does not accurately encode the communication
costs. Experiments performed on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms achieve considerable speedups over alternative solutions.
The optimizations achieved on communication costs become even more pronounced
at high scalability with many processors. The performance benefits are
preserved in deeper GCNs having more layers as well as on billion-scale graphs.

postsynaptic membrane of a neuron plays a key role in determining the strength
of synaptic connections and their regulation during learning and memory. In
this paper we construct and analyze a 2D interfacial diffusion model of
inhibitory synaptic receptor dynamics. The model involves three major
components. First, the boundary of each synapse is treated as a semi-permeable
interface due to the effects of cytoskeletal structures. Second, the effective
diffusivity within a synapse is taken to be smaller than the extrasynaptic
diffusivity due to the temporary binding to scaffold protein buffers within the
synapse. Third, receptors from intracellular pools are inserted into the
membrane extrasynaptically and internalized extrasynaptically and synaptically.
We first solve the model equations for a single synapse in an unbounded domain
and explore how the non-equilibrium steady-state number of synaptic receptors
depends on model parameters. We then use matched asymptotic analysis to solve
the corresponding problem of multiple synapses in a large, bounded domain.
Finally, treating a synapse as a phase separated condensate of scaffold
proteins, we describe how diffusion of individual scaffold proteins can also be
modeled in terms of interfacial diffusion. We thus establish interfacial
diffusion as a general paradigm for exploring synaptic dynamics and plasticity.

whether they want to contribute to a common pool or not, but the resulting
benefit is distributed equally. A conceptually similar dilemma situation may
emerge when participants consider if they claim a common resource but the
related cost is covered equally by all group members. The latter establishes a
reversed form of the original public goods game (R-PGG). In this work, we show
that R-PGG is equivalent to PGG in several circumstances, starting from the
traditional analysis, via the evolutionary approach in unstructured
populations, to Monte Carlo simulations in structured populations. However,
there are also cases when the behavior of R-PGG could be surprisingly different
from the outcome of PGG. When the key parameters are heterogeneous, for
instance, the results of PGG and R-PGG could be diverse even if we apply the
same amplitudes of heterogeneity. We find that the heterogeneity in R-PGG
generally impedes cooperation, while the opposite is observed for PGG. These
diverse system reactions can be understood if we follow how payoff functions
change when introducing heterogeneity in the parameter space. This analysis
also reveals the distinct roles of cooperator and defector strategies in the
mentioned games. Our observations may hopefully stimulate further research to
check the potential differences between PGG and R-PGG due to the alternative
complexity of conditions.

approximation of invariant densities and other important statistical features

composing the associated transfer operator with a suitable finite dimensional
projection (a discretization scheme) as in the well-known Ulam method.
  We introduce a general framework based on a list of properties (of the system
and of the projection) that need to be verified so that we can take advantage
of a so-called ``coarse-fine'' strategy. This strategy is a novel method in
which we exploit information coming from a coarser approximation of the system
to get useful information on a finer approximation, speeding up the
computation. This coarse-fine strategy allows a precise estimation of invariant
densities and also allows to estimate rigorously the speed of mixing of the
system by the speed of mixing of a coarse approximation of it, which can easily
be estimated by the computer.
  The estimates obtained here are rigourous, i.e., they come with exact error
bounds that are guaranteed to hold and take into account both the
discretiazation and the approximations induced by finite-precision arithmetic.
  We apply this framework to several discretization schemes and examples of
invariant density computation from previous works, obtaining a remarkable
reduction in computation time.
  We have implemented the numerical methods described here in the Julia
programming language, and released our implementation publicly as a Julia
package.

have been difficult to identify in coronal images primarily due to their small
size and the lower spatial resolution of the current EUV imagers. Here we
present the first unambiguous signatures of DFs in coronal EUV data using
high-resolution images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar
Orbiter. Using the data acquired with the 174~{\AA} High Resolution Imager
(HRI$_{EUV}$) of EUI, we find many bright dot-like features (of size 0.3-0.5
Mm) that move up and down (often repeatedly) in the core of an active region.
In a space-time map, these features produce parabolic tracks akin to the
chromospheric observations of DFs. Properties such as their speeds (14
km~s$^{-1}$), lifetime (332~s), deceleration (82 m~s$^{-2}$) and lengths
(1293~km) are also reminiscent of the chromospheric DFs. The EUI data strongly

between strong correlations and topological phases of matter. The first of
these projects is a treatment of an infinite dimensional generalization of the
SSH model with local Coulomb interactions which is solved exactly using
DMFT-NRG. Observed in the solution is power-law augmentation of the
non-interacting density of states, as well as a Mott transition. This
calculation represents an exact solution to an interacting topological
insulator in the strongly correlated regime at zero temperature. The second set
of projects involves the development of methods for formulating non-interacting
auxiliary models for strongly correlated systems. These auxiliary models are
able to capture the full dynamics of the original strongly correlated model,
but with only completely non-interacting degrees of freedom, defined in an
enlarged Hilbert space. We motivate the discussion by performing the mapping
analytically for simple interacting systems using non-linear canonical
transformations via a Majorana decomposition. For the nontrivial class of
interacting quantum impurity models, the auxiliary mapping is established
numerically exactly for finite-size systems using exact diagonalization, and
for impurity models in the thermodynamic limit using NRG, both at zero and
finite temperature. We find that the auxiliary systems take the form of
generalized SSH models, which inherit the topological characteristics of those
models. These generalized SSH models are also formalized and investigated in
their own right as novel systems. Finally, we apply this methodology to study
the Mott transition in the Hubbard model. In terms of the auxiliary system, we
find that the Mott transition can be understood as a topological phase
transition, which manifests as the formation and dissociation of topological
domain walls.

However, this is a non-trivial task. Here we build on recent studies suggesting
that using emotional information may improve upon this task. Our study results
in a framework for health mention classification that incorporates affective
features. We present two methods, an intermediate task fine-tuning approach
(implicit) and a multi-feature fusion approach (explicit) to incorporate
emotions into our target task of HMC. We evaluated our approach on 5
HMC-related datasets from different social media platforms including three from
Twitter, one from Reddit and another from a combination of social media
sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach results in
statistically significant performance gains on HMC tasks. By using the
multi-feature fusion approach, we achieve at least a 3% improvement in F1 score
over BERT baselines across all datasets. We also show that considering only
negative emotions does not significantly affect performance on the HMC task.
Additionally, our results indicate that HMC models infused with emotional
knowledge are an effective alternative, especially when other HMC datasets are

first level of the decomposition, a Schwarz-based strategy is used to decouple
the original problem into various subsystems through boundary variable

decomposed into subdomains that are solved independently using the
Schur-complement approach. Convergence is checked in both stages to ensure that
the parallelized implementation of the subsystems can produce identical results

evaluate its effectiveness and applicability for large-scale and

seeking optimal cell average decomposition (OCAD), which arises from
constructing efficient high-order bound-preserving (BP) numerical methods
within Zhang--Shu framework. Since proposed in 2010, Zhang--Shu framework has
attracted extensive attention and been applied to developing many high-order BP
discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume schemes for various hyperbolic
equations. An essential ingredient in the framework is the decomposition of the
cell averages of the numerical solution into a convex combination of the
solution values at certain quadrature points. The classic CAD originally
proposed by Zhang and Shu has been widely used in the past decade. However, the
feasible CADs are not unique, and different CAD would affect the theoretical BP
CFL condition and thus the computational costs. Zhang and Shu only checked, for
the 1D $\mathbb P^2$ and $\mathbb P^3$ spaces, that their classic CAD based on
the Gauss--Lobatto quadrature is optimal in the sense of achieving the mildest
BP CFL conditions.
  In this paper, we establish the general theory for studying the OCAD problem
on Cartesian meshes in 1D and 2D. We rigorously prove that the classic CAD is
optimal for general 1D $\mathbb P^k$ spaces and general 2D $\mathbb Q^k$ spaces
of arbitrary $k$. For the widely used 2D $\mathbb P^k$ spaces, the classic CAD
is not optimal, and we establish the general approach to find out the genuine
OCAD and propose a more practical quasi-optimal CAD, both of which provide much
milder BP CFL conditions than the classic CAD. As a result, our OCAD and
quasi-optimal CAD notably improve the efficiency of high-order BP schemes for a
large class of hyperbolic or convection-dominated equations, at little cost of
only a slight and local modification to the implementation code.

the spatiotemporal architecture design, (ii) the multimodal fusion schemes,
(iii) the pretraining objectives, (iv) the choice of pretraining data, (v)

then develop a step-by-step recipe, dubbed VindLU, for effective VidL

that are capable of aggregating information across the networks. This paper
considers the multilayer degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel, where a

degree-corrections and block connection probability matrices are permitted to
be different. We establish the identifiability of this model and propose a

models and test theories of galaxy formation at low masses; however, they are
difficult to detect because of their low surface brightness. In the Local Group
a handful of UDGs have been found to date, most of which are satellites of the
Milky Way and M31, and only two are isolated galaxies. It is unclear whether so
few UDGs are expected. We address this by studying the population of UDGs
formed in hydrodynamic constrained simulations of the Local Group from the
HESTIA suite. For a Local Group with a total enclosed mass $M_{\rm LG}\!\left(<
2.5\, {\rm Mpc}\right)=8\times10^{12}\, {\rm M_\odot}$, we predict that there
are $12\pm3$ isolated UDGs (68% confidence) with stellar masses $10^6 \leq

population of UDGs in the Local Group field would be observable in a future
all-sky survey with a depth similar to the SDSS, the Dark Energy Survey, or the

At low densities, competition between moir\'e bands leads to a transition from
commensurate arrangements of singlets at doubly occupied sites to triplet

generally favored at high densities as dispersive bands are populated, but are

former being a dynamical field. After discussing various approaches towards
managing the pathologies associated with non-compact gauge theories, we compute
the tree-level amplitude for fermion scattering via a spin connection exchange.

with $f_\mathrm{1 Gyr}>0.1$ are rare at $z\sim0.4$ ($\lesssim 0.5\%$ of the

Relaxing this threshold, we find that galaxies with $f_\mathrm{1 Gyr}>5\%$

to stabilize the associated moduli. According to the effective field theory,
this gives rise, when combined with fluxes, to supersymmetric AdS$_4$

vacua. We first find the supersymmetry equations for type II AdS$_4$ vacua with
gaugino condensates on D-branes, in the framework of generalized complex
geometry. We then solve them for type IIB compactifications with gaugino
condensates on smeared D7-branes. We show that supersymmetry requires a
(conformal) Calabi-Yau manifold and imaginary self-dual three-form fluxes with
an additional (0,3) component. The latter is proportional to the cosmological
constant, whose magnitude is determined by the expectation value of the gaugino
condensate and the stabilized volume of the cycle wrapped by the branes. This
confirms, qualitatively and quantitatively, the results obtained using
effective field theory. We find that exponential separation between the AdS and
the KK scales seems possible as long as the three-form fluxes are such that
their (0,3) component is exponentially suppressed. As for the localized
solution, it requires going beyond SU(3)-structure internal manifolds.
Nevertheless, we show that the action can be evaluated on-shell without relying
on the details of such complicated configuration. We find that no ""perfect

angle and the first polarimetry studies of TDEs are now available, calling for
a theoretical interpretation. In this study, we model the continuum
polarization levels of TDEs using the radiative transfer code POSSIS and the
collision-induced outflow (CIO) TDE emission scenario where unbound shocked gas
originating from a debris stream intersection point offset from the black hole,
reprocesses the hard emission from the accretion flow into UV and optical
bands. We explore two different cases of peak mass fallback rates M'p (~3 and
~0.3 Msol/yr) while varying the following geometrical parameters: the distance
R_int from the black hole (BH) to the intersection point, the radius of the
photosphere around the BH R_ph, on the surface of which the photons are
generated, and the opening angle Deltheta (anisotropic emission). For the high
mass fallback rate case, we find for every viewing angle polarization levels
below one (P<1%) and P<0.5% for 10/12 simulations. The absolute value of
polarization reaches its maximum (P_max) for equatorial viewing angles. For the
low mass fallback rate case, the maximum value predicted is P~8.8% and P_max is
reached for intermediate viewing angles. We find that the polarization depends
strongly on i) the optical depths at the central regions set by the different
M'p values and ii) the viewing angle. Finally, by comparing our model
predictions to polarization observations of a few TDEs, we attempt to constrain
their observed viewing angles and we show that multi-epoch polarimetric
observations can become a key factor in constraining the viewing angle of TDEs.

the intracluster plasma of galaxy clusters. We present the entropy profile of
the Abell 2244 galaxy cluster derived both exclusively using X-ray data from
the low-background Swift XRT telescope and also using Planck y data. The
entropy profile derivation using X-rays only is robust at least to the virial
radius because the cluster brightness is large compared to the X-ray background
at low energies, temperature is strongly bounded by the lack of cluster X-ray
photons at energies kT>3 keV, and the XRT background is low, stable and
understood. In the observed solid angle, about one quadrant, the entropy radial
profile deviates from a power-law at the virial radius, mainly because of a
sharp drop of the cluster temperature. This bending of the entropy profile is
confirmed when X-ray spectral information is replaced by the Compton map.
Clumping and non-thermal pressure support are insufficient to restore a power
law entropy profile because they are bound to be small by: a) the agreement
between mass estimates from different tracers (gas and galaxies), b) the
agreement between entropy profile determinations based on combinations of

have tested using S2 star orbit data. Our model adds five parameters to the

displaying X-ray outbursts reaching peak luminosities of 10$^{38}$ erg/s and
spend most of their life in more quiescent states with luminosities as low as
10$^{32}$-10$^{33}$ erg/s. The main goal of our comprehensive and uniform
analysis of the SFXT Swift triggers is to provide tools to predict whether a
transient which has no known X-ray counterpart may be an SFXT candidate. These
tools can be exploited for the development of future missions exploring the
variable X-ray sky through large FoV instruments. We examined all available
data on outbursts of SFXTs that triggered the Swift/BAT collected between
2005-08-30 and 2014-12-31, in particular those for which broad-band data,
including the Swift/XRT ones, are also available. We processed all BAT and XRT
data uniformly with the Swift Burst Analyser to produce spectral evolution
dependent flux light curves for each outburst. The BAT data allowed us to infer
useful diagnostics to set SFXT triggers apart from the general GRB population,
showing that SFXTs give rise uniquely to image triggers and are simultaneously
very long, faint, and `soft' hard-X-ray transients. The BAT data alone can
discriminate very well the SFXTs from other fast transients such as anomalous
X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters. However, to distinguish SFXTs from, for
instance, accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars and jetted tidal disruption
events, the XRT data collected around the time of the BAT triggers are
decisive. The XRT observations of 35/52 SFXT BAT triggers show that in the soft
X-ray energy band, SFXTs display a decay in flux from the peak of the outburst
of at least 3 orders of magnitude within a day and rarely undergo large
re-brightening episodes, favouring in most cases a rapid decay down to the
quiescent level within 3-5 days (at most). [Abridged]

our convergence guarantee matches the guarantee of (full-gradient) gradient
descent, but with the gradient Lipschitz constant being defined w.r.t.~a

to decrease the per-iteration cost and match the arithmetic operation
complexity of current optimal stochastic full-gradient methods, with a unified
analysis for both finite-sum and infinite-sum cases. We prove a faster linear
convergence result when a Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition holds. To our

  An Application of the James Webb Space Telescope","20 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Line-intensity mapping (IM) experiments seek to perform statistical
measurements of large-scale structure with spectral lines such as 21cm, CO, and
Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$). A challenge in these observations is to ensure
that astrophysical foregrounds, such as galactic synchrotron emission in 21cm
measurements, are properly removed. One method that has the potential to reduce
foreground contamination is to cross correlate with a galaxy survey that
overlaps with the IM volume. However, telescopes sensitive to high-redshift
galaxies typically have small field of views (FOVs) compared to IM surveys.
Thus, a galaxy survey for cross correlation would necessarily consist of pencil
beams which sparsely fill the IM volume. In this paper, we develop the
formalism to forecast the sensitivity of cross correlations between IM
experiments and pencil-beam galaxy surveys. We find that a random distribution
of pencil beams leads to very similar overall sensitivity as a lattice spaced
across the IM survey and derive a simple formula for random configurations that
agrees with the Fisher matrix formalism. We explore examples of combining
high-redshift James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with both a
SPHEREx-like Ly$\alpha$ IM survey and a 21cm experiment based on the Hydrogen
Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). We find that the JWST-SPHEREx case is
promising, leading to a total signal-to-noise of ${\sim}7$ after 100 total
hours of JWST (at $z=7$). We find that HERA is not well-suited for this
approach owing to its drift-scan strategy, but that a similar experiment that
can integrate down on one field could be.

  the Rotating Wave Approximation",,,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Superconducting qubits typically use a dispersive readout scheme, where a
resonator is coupled to a qubit such that its frequency is qubit-state
dependent. Measurement is performed by driving the resonator, where the
transmitted resonator field yields information about the resonator frequency
and thus the qubit state. Ideally, we could use arbitrarily strong resonator
drives to achieve a target signal-to-noise ratio in the shortest possible time.
However, experiments have shown that when the average resonator photon number
exceeds a certain threshold, the qubit is excited out of its computational
subspace, which we refer to as a measurement-induced state transition. These
transitions degrade readout fidelity, and constitute leakage which precludes
further operation of the qubit in, for example, error correction. Here we study
these transitions using a transmon qubit by experimentally measuring their
dependence on qubit frequency, average photon number, and qubit state, in the
regime where the resonator frequency is lower than the qubit frequency. We
observe signatures of resonant transitions between levels in the coupled
qubit-resonator system that exhibit noisy behavior when measured repeatedly in
time. We provide a semi-classical model of these transitions based on the
rotating wave approximation and use it to predict the onset of state
transitions in our experiments. Our results suggest the transmon is excited to
levels near the top of its cosine potential following a state transition, where
the charge dispersion of higher transmon levels explains the observed noisy
behavior of state transitions. Moreover, occupation in these higher energy
levels poses a major challenge for fast qubit reset.

next-generation wireless. RIS technology also opens up the possibility of new
security threats, since the reflection of impinging signals can be used for
malicious purposes. This article introduces the basic concept for a
RIS-assisted attack that re-uses the legitimate signal towards a malicious
objective. Specific attacks are identified from this base scenario, and the
RIS-assisted signal cancellation attack is selected for evaluation as an attack
that inherently exploits RIS capabilities. The key takeaway from the evaluation
is that an effective attack requires accurate channel information, a RIS
deployed in a favorable location (from the point of view of the attacker), and
it disproportionately affects legitimate links that already suffer from reduced
path loss. These observations motivate specific security solutions and
recommendations for future work.

learning approaches hinges on the unrealistic scenario of fully labeled data.
In this paper, we tackle this challenge and propose an approach for continual
semi-supervised learning--a setting where not all the data samples are labeled.
A primary issue in this scenario is the model forgetting representations of
unlabeled data and overfitting the labeled samples. We leverage the power of
nearest-neighbor classifiers to nonlinearly partition the feature space and
flexibly model the underlying data distribution thanks to its non-parametric
nature. This enables the model to learn a strong representation for the current
task, and distill relevant information from previous tasks. We perform a
thorough experimental evaluation and show that our method outperforms all the
existing approaches by large margins, setting a solid state of the art on the
continual semi-supervised learning paradigm. For example, on CIFAR-100 we
surpass several others even when using at least 30 times less supervision (0.8%
vs. 25% of annotations). Finally, our method works well on both low and high
resolution images and scales seamlessly to more complex datasets such as
ImageNet-100. The code is publicly available on

N/O ratio in the interstellar medium is crucial for a comprehensive picture of
galaxy chemical evolution at high-redshift because most observational
metallicity (O/H) estimates are implicitly dependent on the N/O ratio. The
observed N/O at high-redshift shows an overall constancy with O/H, albeit with
a large scatter. We show that these heretofore unexplained features can be
explained by the pre-supernova wind yields from rotating massive stars
(M$\gtrsim 10 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$, $v/v_{\rm{crit}} \gtrsim 0.4$). Our models
naturally produce the observed N/O plateau, as well as the scatter at low O/H.
We find the scatter to arise from varying star formation efficiency. However,
the models that have supernovae dominated yields produce a poor fit to the
observed N/O at low O/H. This peculiar abundance pattern at low O/H suggests
that dwarf galaxies are most likely to be devoid of SNe yields and are
primarily enriched by pre-supernova wind abundances.

learning application for years, there has been little consideration of the

rely on the assumption that their testing environments are analogous to the
structured images on which they are trained. This paper combats this notion,
arguing that mole size, a vital attribute in professional dermatology, is a red

consistently larger than benign melanomas, this distinction proves unreliable
and harmful when images cannot be contextually scaled. This implementation
builds a custom model that eliminates size as a training feature to prevent
overfitting to incorrect parameters. Additionally, random rotation and contrast
augmentations are performed to simulate the real-world use of melanoma

the generalization abilities of mole classifiers. These implementations show
that user unpredictability is crucial when utilizing such applications. The
caution required when manually modifying data is acknowledged, as data loss and

Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) approach to examine these anomalous
neutral triple gauge couplings in a model independent way. There are four
independent dimension-8 operators that generate these gauge interactions, one
of them is CP-conserving and rest three are CP-violating. We adopt optimal
observable technique to extract the sensitivity at which these anomalous

the impact and advantage of beam polarization in these precision measurements.

  Devices with Dynamic Power Management",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  During the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices, many
research efforts are devoted to the limited hardware resource. However, little
attention is paid to the influence of dynamic power management. As edge devices
typically only have a budget of energy with batteries (rather than almost
unlimited energy support on servers or workstations), their dynamic power
management often changes the execution frequency as in the widely-used dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique. This leads to highly unstable
inference speed performance, especially for computation-intensive DNN models,
which can harm user experience and waste hardware resources. We firstly
identify this problem and then propose All-in-One, a highly representative
pruning framework to work with dynamic power management using DVFS. The
framework can use only one set of model weights and soft masks (together with
other auxiliary parameters of negligible storage) to represent multiple models
of various pruning ratios. By re-configuring the model to the corresponding
pruning ratio for a specific execution frequency (and voltage), we are able to
achieve stable inference speed, i.e., keeping the difference in speed
performance under various execution frequencies as small as possible. Our
experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves high accuracy for
multiple models of different pruning ratios, but also reduces their variance of
inference latency for various frequencies, with minimal memory consumption of
only one model and one soft mask.

fractional quantum Hall states. Although braiding is usually thought as a
two-dimensional adiabatic manipulation, the braiding phase can also be captured
in one dimension in an out-of-equilibrium setting. We discuss here to what
extend a beam splitter reveals the braiding phase when excited with voltage or
current pulses. We identify two main physical mechanisms that govern the sign
and the size of the output cross-correlations: the non-linearity, characterized
by the tunneling exponent, and the presence of holes in the incoming beams,
related to the braiding phase. We show how the incoming signals form an
environment for the beam splitter (akin to the dynamical Coulomb blockade
effect) and thus interpret the mixing not as a collision of particles, but as a
collision or interference of waves. We illustrate the physical picture with
various examples of excitations for integer and fractional Hall states and show
the emergence of genuine antibunching statistics when mixing dense voltage
pulses.

facilitate representation learning by exploiting the intact integration of
multi-view features. Because most objects in real world often have underlying
connections, organizing multi-view data as heterogeneous graphs is beneficial
to extracting latent information among different objects. Due to the powerful
capability to gather information of neighborhood nodes, in this paper, we apply
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to cope with heterogeneous-graph data
originating from multi-view data, which is still under-explored in the field of
GCN. In order to improve the quality of network topology and alleviate the
interference of noises yielded by graph fusion, some methods undertake sorting
operations before the graph convolution procedure. These GCN-based methods
generally sort and select the most confident neighborhood nodes for each
vertex, such as picking the top-k nodes according to pre-defined confidence
values. Nonetheless, this is problematic due to the non-differentiable sorting
operators and inflexible graph embedding learning, which may result in blocked
gradient computations and undesired performance. To cope with these issues, we
propose a joint framework dubbed Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network with
Differentiable Node Selection (MGCN-DNS), which is constituted of an adaptive
graph fusion layer, a graph learning module and a differentiable node selection
schema. MGCN-DNS accepts multi-channel graph-structural data as inputs and aims
to learn more robust graph fusion through a differentiable neural network. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by rigorous comparisons with
considerable state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multi-view semi-supervised

statistical physics, scoring how far a stochastic process is from being

processes at non-equilibrium steady-state under the condition that the
time-reversal of the diffusion remains a diffusion. We start by characterising
the entropy production of both discrete and continuous-time Markov processes.
We investigate the time-reversal of time-homogeneous stationary diffusions and
recall the most general conditions for the reversibility of the diffusion
property, which includes hypoelliptic and degenerate diffusions, and locally
Lipschitz vector fields. We decompose the drift into its time-reversible and
irreversible parts, or equivalently, the generator into symmetric and
antisymmetric operators. We show the equivalence with a decomposition of the
backward Kolmogorov equation considered in hypocoercivity theory, and a
decomposition of the Fokker-Planck equation in GENERIC form. The main result
shows that when the time-irreversible part of the drift is in the range of the
volatility matrix (almost everywhere) the forward and time-reversed path space
measures of the process are mutually equivalent, and evaluates the entropy
production. When this does not hold, the measures are mutually singular and the
entropy production is infinite. We verify these results using exact numerical
simulations of linear diffusions. We illustrate the discrepancy between the
entropy production of non-linear diffusions and their numerical simulations in
several examples and illustrate how the entropy production can be used for
accurate numerical simulation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between
time-irreversibility and sampling efficiency, and how we can modify the
definition of entropy production to score how far a process is from being
generalised reversible.

schemes, including both proofs that standard schemes have structure-preserving
properties and proposals for novel schemes that achieve both high-order

major downside to these schemes is that their structure-preserving properties
generally rely on exact solution of the (possibly nonlinear) systems of
equations defining each time-step in the discrete scheme. For small systems,
this is often possible (up to the accuracy of floating-point arithmetic), but
it becomes impractical for the large linear systems that arise when considering

capture therapy, where nitrogen-related dose is the main component due to
low-energy neutrons, and in astrophysics, where 14N acts as a neutron poison in
the s-process. Several discrepancies remain between the existing data obtained
in partial energy ranges: thermal energy, keV region and resonance region.
Purpose: Measuring the 14N(n,p)14C cross section from thermal to the resonance
region in a single measurement for the first time, including characterization
of the first resonances, and providing calculations of Maxwellian averaged
cross sections (MACS). Method: Time-of-flight technique. Experimental Area 2
(EAR-2) of the neutron time-of-flight (n_TOF) facility at CERN.
$^{10}$B(n,${\alpha}$)$^7$Li and $^{235}$U(n,f) reactions as references. Two
detection systems running simultaneously, one on-beam and another off-beam.
Description of the resonances with the R-matrix code sammy. Results: The cross
section has been measured from sub-thermal energy to 800 keV resolving the two
first resonances (at 492.7 and 644 keV). A thermal cross-section
(1.809$\pm$0.045 b) lower than the two most recent measurements by slightly
more than one standard deviation, but in line with the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and
JEFF-3.3 evaluations has been obtained. A 1/v energy dependence of the cross
section has been confirmed up to tens of keV neutron energy. The low energy
tail of the first resonance at 492.7 keV is lower than suggested by evaluated
values, while the overall resonance strength agrees with evaluations.
Conclusions: Our measurement has allowed to determine the $^{14}$N(n,p)
cross-section over a wide energy range for the first time. We have obtained
cross-sections with high accuracy (2.5 %) from sub-thermal energy to 800 keV
and used these data to calculate the MACS for kT = 5 to kT = 100 keV.

countless implementations of quantum information processing. However, full
controllability is rarely achieved in most platforms due to specific physical
limitations. In this work, we completely characterize the linear two-mode
interfaces under the most pessimistic restriction that only single-mode
operation is available. When arbitrary single-mode operations can be applied to
both modes, we find that every interface can be characterized by an invariant
transmission strength. On the other hand, in the practical situation that
squeezing is restricted in one of the modes, we discover two additional
quantities, irreducible squeezing and irreducible shearing, that are invariant
under the allowable controls. By using this characterization, we develop
systematic strategies to engineer an arbitrary interface through cascading
multiple fixed component interfaces. Without squeezing restriction, our
protocol is optimal and requires at most three component interfaces. Under the
squeezing constraint, our protocol can be extended to engineer also the
additional invariants by using no more than two more rounds of cascade. We also
propose the remote squeezing scheme to tackle the squeezing restriction through
interfacing with an active auxiliary mode.

color of blue galactic halo stars. The galactic halo stars belong to an old
stellar population of the Milky Way and have relatively low metallicity. The
""blue tip"" of the halo population -- the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars --
is known to have a relatively uniform intrinsic edge u-g color with only slow
spatial variation. In SDSS data, the observed variation is correlated with
galactic latitude, which we attribute to contamination by higher-metallicity
disk stars and fit with an empirical curve. This curve can then be used to
calibrate u-band imaging if g-band imaging of matching depth is available. Our
approach can be applied to single-field observations at $|b| > 30^\circ$, and
removes the need for standard star observations or overlap with calibrated
u-band imaging. We include in our method the calibration of g-band data with
ATLAS-Refcat2. We test our approach on stars in KiDS DR 4, ATLAS DR 4, and
DECam imaging from the NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC DR2), and compare our
calibration with SDSS. For this process, we use synthetic magnitudes to derive
the color equations between these datasets, in order to improve zero-point
accuracy. We find an improvement for all datasets, reaching a zero-point
precision of 0.016 mag for KiDS (compared to the original 0.033 mag), 0.020 mag
for ATLAS (originally 0.027 mag), and 0.016 mag for DECam (originally 0.041

precision in u-band for the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time

search for ""technosignatures"" from extraterrestrial intelligences/agents.
Technosignatures require significant energy to be visible across interstellar
space and thus intentional signals might be concentrated in frequency, in time,
or in space, to be found in mutually obvious places. Therefore, it could be
advantageous to search for technosignatures in parts of parameter space that
are mutually-derivable to an observer on Earth and a distant transmitter. In
this work, we used the L-band (1.1-1.9 GHz) receiver on the Robert C. Byrd
Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to perform the first technosignature search
pre-synchronized with exoplanet transits, covering 12 Kepler systems. We used
the Breakthrough Listen turboSETI pipeline to flag narrowband hits ($\sim$3 Hz)
using a maximum drift rate of $\pm$614.4 Hz/s and a signal-to-noise threshold
of 5 - the pipeline returned $\sim 3.4 \times 10^5$ apparently-localized
features. Visual inspection by a team of citizen scientists ruled out 99.6% of
them. Further analysis found 2 signals-of-interest that warrant follow-up, but
no technosignatures. If the signals-of-interest are not re-detected in future
work, it will imply that the 12 targets in the search are not producing
transit-aligned signals from 1.1-1.9 GHz with transmitter powers $>$60 times
that of the former Arecibo radar. This search debuts a range of innovative
technosignature techniques: citizen science vetting of potential
signals-of-interest, a sensitivity-aware search out to extremely high drift
rates, a more flexible method of analyzing on-off cadences, and an extremely
low signal-to-noise threshold.

depends on the distance to the follower. We determine the exact stability
condition of the finite system with $N$ vehicles and periodic boundaries. The
stable system is ergodic with a unique Gaussian invariant measure. Other model
properties are studied using numerical simulation. It turns out that the

progress has been made on advancing their physical fidelity, existing modeling
tools have not taken full advantage of emerging programming paradigms and

addressing this gap, this work presents a new wildfire simulation framework
that enables landscape-scale wildfire simulations with physical representation
of the combustion at affordable computational cost. This is achieved by
developing a coupled fire/atmosphere model in the TensorFlow programming
paradigm, which enables highly efficient and scalable computations on Tensor
Processing Unit (TPU) hardware architecture. To validate this simulation
framework and demonstrate its efficiency, simulations of the prescribed fire
experiment FireFlux II (Clements et al., 2019) are performed. By considering a
parametric study on the mesh resolution, we show that the global quantities
such as volumetric heat release and fire-spread rate are insensitive to the
horizontal mesh resolution within a range between 0.5 m and 2 m, which is
sufficient for predicting fire intermittency and dynamic fire properties
associated with fine-scale turbulent structures in the atmospheric boundary
layer.

  We use a variant of the method of Lagrange multipliers which is based on the
minimization of an auxiliary objective function (called Lagrangian) combining
the objective function with the restrictions, taken with some constants called
multipliers. Subsequently, the multipliers are used to make the solution comply
with the restrictions.
  We develop a computer-oriented method of minimization of the Lagrangian

longer server downtime than overpredicting maintenance job duration. The system
cost of underprediction is much larger than that of overprediction.
  We present Acela, a machine learning system for predicting maintenance job
duration, which uses quantile regression to bias duration predictions toward
overprediction. We integrate Acela into a maintenance job scheduler and
evaluate it on datasets from large-scale, production datacenters. Compared to
machine learning based predictors from prior work, Acela reduces the number of
servers that are taken offline by 1.87-4.28X, and reduces the server offline
time by 1.40-2.80X.

the presence of an even infinitesimal dissipation in the inertial range is
shown to lead to a singularity in the GFD $D_q$ (at $q=1$) of the energy

multiplicative formulation for a dissipative inertial cascade. The purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that this can be resolved by introducing a new
appropriate ansatz for the definition of the GFD $D_q$ to incorporate the
effect of a scale-invariant dissipation via a phenomenological dissipative
parameter $K$ $( 0 < K < 1)$. This dissipation parameter is also shown to cause
a steeper energy spectrum in the inertial range, as to be expected. This ansatz
is then generalized to incorporate a more symmetric dissipation via two

increase the ratio of the Na 1s ratio of the CDs from 1.86 to 7.42. The CDs can
emit blue fluorescence under ultraviolet irradiation. After reduction, the
R-CDS have the intensity of fluorescence 7.2 times than before and the
fluorescence quantum yield increase from 6.13\% to 8.86\%. The
photoluminescence (PL) wavelength of R-CDS have red-shift of 7 nm which was due

This covers signals in any Hilbert space $\mathscr H$, including

generally inner products of the signals with given kernel functions in
$\mathscr H$. An attractive feature of the POCS method is the unconditional
convergence of its iterates to an estimate that is consistent with the samples
of the input, even when these samples are of very heterogeneous nature on top
of their non-uniformity, and/or under insufficient sampling. Moreover, the
error of the iterates is systematically monotonically decreasing, and their
limit retrieves the input signal whenever the samples are uniquely
characteristic of this signal. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the
case where the sampling kernel functions are orthogonal in $\mathscr H$, while
the input may be confined in a smaller closed space $\mathscr A$ (of
bandlimitation for example). This covers the increasingly popular application
of time encoding by integration, including multi-channel encoding. We push the
analysis of the POCS method in this case by giving a special parallelized

to work poorly on sequences requiring long-term memorization, despite having
this capacity in principle. We aim to address both shortcomings with a class of
recurrent networks that use a stochastic state transition mechanism between
cell applications. This mechanism, which we term state-regularization, makes
RNNs transition between a finite set of learnable states. We evaluate
state-regularized RNNs on (1) regular languages for the purpose of automata
extraction; (2) non-regular languages such as balanced parentheses and
palindromes where external memory is required; and (3) real-word sequence
learning tasks for sentiment analysis, visual object recognition and text
categorisation. We show that state-regularization (a) simplifies the extraction
of finite state automata that display an RNN's state transition dynamic; (b)
forces RNNs to operate more like automata with external memory and less like
finite state machines, which potentiality leads to a more structural memory;
(c) leads to better interpretability and explainability of RNNs by leveraging
the probabilistic finite state transition mechanism over time steps.

environment, it is still challenging to develop fully automated robots. For a
long time in the future, workers and robots will coexist and collaborate with
each other to build or maintain a facility efficiently. As an emerging field,
human-robot collaboration (HRC) still faces various open problems. To this end,
this pioneer research introduces an agent-based modeling approach to
investigate the coupling effect and scale effect of HRC in the bricklaying
process. With multiple experiments based on simulation, the dynamic and complex
nature of HRC is illustrated in two folds: 1) agents in HRC are interdependent
due to human factors of workers, features of robots, and their collaboration
behaviors; 2) different parameters of HRC are correlated and have significant
impacts on construction productivity (CP). Accidentally and interestingly, it
is discovered that HRC has a scale effect on CP, which means increasing the
number of collaborated human-robot teams will lead to higher CP even if the
human-robot ratio keeps unchanged. Overall, it is argued that more
investigations in HRC are needed for efficient construction, occupational
safety, etc.; and this research can be taken as a stepstone for developing and
evaluating new robots, optimizing HRC processes, and even training future
industrial workers in the construction industry.

highly symmetric lattices, symmetry breaking may take place in their bilayers
upon certain stacking order, giving rise to so-called sliding ferroelectricity
where the vertical polarizations can be electrically reversed via interlayer
translation. However, it is not supposed to appear in systems like graphene
bilayer with centro-symmetry at any stacking configuration, and the origin of
the recently reported ferroelectricity in graphene bilayer intercalated between
h-BN (Nature 2020, 588, 71) is still unclear. Here we propose a model of
across-layer sliding ferroelectricity that arises from the asymmetry of next
neighbor interlayer couplings. The vertical polarizations in intercalated
centro-symmetric 2D materials like graphene bilayer can be switched via
multilayer sliding, and the observed ferroelectric hysteresis can be clarified.
Moreover, such ferroelectricity can exist in a series of other heterolayers
with quasi-degenerate polar states, like graphene bilayer or trilayer on BN
substrate, or even with a molecule layer on surface where each molecule can
store 1 bit data independently, resolving the bottleneck issue of sliding
ferroelectricity for high-density data storage.

in computer aided design for simulation and manufacturing. This procedure
simplifies the meshing process, and it enables faster simulations with less

one wants to solve, removing some important geometrical features may greatly
impact the solution accuracy. For instance, in solid mechanics simulations,
such features can be holes or fillets near stress concentration regions.
Unfortunately, the effect of geometrical simplification on the accuracy of the
problem solution is often neglected, or its evaluation is based on engineering
expertise only due to the lack of reliable tools. It is therefore important to
have a better understanding of the effect of geometrical model simplification,
also called defeaturing, to improve our control on the simulation accuracy
along the design and analysis phase. In this work, we consider the Poisson
equation as a model problem, we focus on isogeometric discretizations, and we
build an adaptive strategy that is twofold. Firstly, it performs standard mesh
refinement in a (potentially trimmed multipatch) defeatured geometry described
via truncated hierarchical B-splines. Secondly, it is also able to perform
geometrical refinement, that is, to choose at each iteration step which
geometrical feature is important to obtain an accurate solution. To drive this
adaptive strategy, we introduce an a posteriori estimator of the energy error
between the exact solution defined in the exact fully-featured geometry, and
the numerical approximation of the solution defined in the defeatured geometry.
The reliability of the estimator is proven for very general geometric
configurations, and numerical experiments are performed to validate the

provides a general framework to describe \textit{phenomenologically} the phase
transition by the introduction of order parameters and the associated symmetry
breakings; and is also taken as starting point to explore the critical
phenomena in connection with phase transitions in renormalization group, which
provides a complete theoretical description of the behavior close to the
critical points. In this sense the microscopic mechanism of the phase
transition remains still to be uncovered. Here we make a first attempt to
explore the microscopic mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the
quantum Rabi model (QRM). We firstly perform a diagonalization in an operator
space to obtain three fundamental patterns involved in the QRM and then analyze
explicitly their energy evolutions with increasing coupling strengths. The
characteristic behaviors found uncover the microscipic mechanism of the
superradiant phase transition: one is active to drive the happening of phase
transition, the second responses rapidly to the change of the active pattern
and wakes up the third pattern to stablize the new phase. This kind of
dissecting mechanism explains for the first time why and how happens the
superradiant phase transition in the QRM and paves a way to explore the

communities. Despite its importance, however, the interplay between invasion
and interaction has not been well explored. Here, we investigate how invasion
affects the population composition with interactions in open evolving systems
considering generalized Lotka-Volterra-type dynamics. Our results show that the
system has two distinct regimes. One is characterized by low diversity with
abrupt changes of dominant species in time, appearing when the interaction
between species is strong and invasion slowly occurs. On the other hand,
frequent invasions can induce higher diversity with slow changes in abundances
despite strong interactions. It is because invasion happens before the system
reaches its equilibrium, which drags the system from its equilibrium all the
time. All species have similar abundances in this regime, which implies that
fast invasion induces regime shift. Therefore, whether invasion or interaction
dominates determines the population composition.

  Misbehaving Peers","In review",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GossipSub is a new peer-to-peer communication protocol designed to counter
attacks from misbehaving peers by carefully controlling what information is
disseminated and to whom, via a score function computed by each peer that
captures positive and negative behaviors of its neighbors. The score function
depends on several parameters (weights, caps, thresholds, etc.) that can be
configured by applications using GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is
written in English and its resilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is
supported empirically by emulation testing using an implementation in Golang.
  In this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience
of GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model
of GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed
by GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary size
and topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove and
disprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security
properties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior and
rewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can
be configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad
behavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations
for two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains.
We show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0
network (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving
peers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously
misbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores
so that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub.

synthetic spectra and a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to fit specific
K-band spectral regions and determine the photospheric temperature ($T_{\rm
eff}$), surface gravity ($\log$ g), magnetic field strength (B), projected
rotational velocity ($v \sin i$), and K-band veiling ($r_{\rm K}$). We
determined B for $\sim$46% of our sample. Stellar parameters were compared to
the results from Taurus-Auriga and the TW Hydrae Association (TWA) presented in
Paper I of this series. We classified all the YSOs in the IGRINS survey with
infrared spectral indices from 2MASS and WISE photometry between 2 and
24~$\mu$m. We found that Class II YSOs typically have lower $\log$ g and $v\sin
i$, similar B, and higher K-band veiling than their Class III counterparts.
Additionally, we determined the stellar parameters for a sample of K and M
field stars also observed with IGRINS. We have identified intrinsic
similarities and differences at different evolutionary stages with our
homogeneous determination of stellar parameters in the IGRINS YSO Survey.
Considering $\log$ g as a proxy for age, we found that the Ophiuchus and Taurus
samples have a similar age. We also find that Upper Scorpius and TWA YSOs have
similar ages, and are more evolved than Ophiuchus/Taurus YSOs.

logic (STL) specifications with neural networks (NNs). Most of the previous
works consider training a controller for only a given STL specification. These
approaches, however, require retraining the NN controller if a new
specification arises and needs to be satisfied, which results in large
consumption of memory and inefficient training. To tackle this problem, we
propose to construct NN controllers by introducing encoder-decoder structured
NNs with an attention mechanism. The encoder takes an STL formula as input and
encodes it into an appropriate vector, and the decoder outputs control signals
that will meet the given specification. As the encoder, we consider three NN
structures: sequential, tree-structured, and graph-structured NNs. All the
model parameters are trained in an end-to-end manner to maximize the expected
robustness that is known to be a quantitative semantics of STL formulae. We
compare the control performances attained by the above NN structures through a
numerical experiment of the path planning problem, showing the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

providing diet recommendations that reflect both the (often unknown) dietary
preferences of different patient groups and known dietary constraints specified
by human experts. Motivated by this challenge, we develop a preference-aware
constrained-inference approach in which the objective function of an
optimization problem is not pre-specified and can differ across various
segments. Among existing methods, clustering models from machine learning are
not naturally suited for recovering the constrained optimization problems,
whereas constrained inference models such as inverse optimization do not
explicitly address non-homogeneity in given datasets. By harnessing the
strengths of both clustering and inverse optimization techniques, we develop a
novel approach that recovers the utility functions of a constrained
optimization process across clusters while providing optimal diet
recommendations as cluster representatives. Using a dataset of patients' daily
food intakes, we show how our approach generalizes stand-alone clustering and
inverse optimization approaches in terms of adherence to dietary guidelines and
partitioning observations, respectively. The approach makes diet
recommendations by incorporating both patient preferences and expert
recommendations for healthier diets, leading to structural improvements in both
patient partitioning and nutritional recommendations for each cluster. An
appealing feature of our method is its ability to consider infeasible but
informative observations for a given set of dietary constraints. The resulting
recommendations correspond to a broader range of dietary options, even when
they limit unhealthy choices.

The responses given by participants were also recorded as neural signals using

behavioral patterns. There was an active correlation between personality values
and decision-making. Preliminary analysis was focused on studying the
differences in lower brain frequencies (0.1-4Hz) when the participants
developed frustration, in contrast to when they experienced gratitude. The
study presents three case studies in which delta frequencies increased in cases
when frustration was experienced and decreased when gratitude was experienced.
The study focused on understanding the neural underpinnings of corresponding
modified behavior in adolescents. The findings highlight an increase in delta
frequencies when apparent frustration was developed in adolescents due to their
peer unethical behavior. The delta frequencies lowered when participants were
tested for ethical behavior. The results concluded that based on personality
value types, adolescents tend to develop frustration toward perceived unethical
behavior and carry it over to other unrelated peers. This study is highly

explain the QSME fairly accurately, and the QSME light curve is a superposition
of the light curves of an eclipse and an occultation. Notably, the observed
flux drops are within 2.6% of the theoretical predictions. The size of the

  Mosaicing in Non-Ideal System Configuration",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) has started to gain attention in the field of
near-bottom close-range underwater inspection because of its high resolution
and high framerate features. Although Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)
algorithms have been applied tentatively for object-searching tasks, human
supervision is still indispensable, especially when involving critical areas. A
clear FLS mosaic containing all suspicious information is in demand to help
experts deal with tremendous perception data. However, previous work only
considered that FLS is working in an ideal system configuration, which assumes
an appropriate sonar imaging setup and the availability of accurate positioning
data. Without those promises, the intra-frame and inter-frame artifacts will
appear and degrade the quality of the final mosaic by making the information of
interest invisible. In this paper, we propose a novel blending method for FLS
mosaicing which can preserve interested information. A Long-Short Time Sliding
Window (LST-SW) is designed to rectify the local statistics of raw sonar
images. The statistics are then utilized to construct a Global Variance Map
(GVM). The GVM helps to emphasize the useful information contained in images in
the blending phase by classifying the informative and featureless pixels,
thereby enhancing the quality of final mosaic. The method is verified using
data collected in the real environment. The results show that our method can
preserve more details in FLS mosaics for human inspection purposes in practice.

a diffractive optical network-based multispectral imaging system trained using
deep learning to create a virtual spectral filter array at the output image
field-of-view. This diffractive multispectral imager performs
spatially-coherent imaging over a large spectrum, and at the same time, routes
a pre-determined set of spectral channels onto an array of pixels at the output
plane, converting a monochrome focal plane array or image sensor into a
multispectral imaging device without any spectral filters or image recovery
algorithms. Furthermore, the spectral responsivity of this diffractive
multispectral imager is not sensitive to input polarization states. Through
numerical simulations, we present different diffractive network designs that
achieve snapshot multispectral imaging with 4, 9 and 16 unique spectral bands
within the visible spectrum, based on passive spatially-structured diffractive
surfaces, with a compact design that axially spans ~72 times the mean
wavelength of the spectral band of interest. Moreover, we experimentally
demonstrate a diffractive multispectral imager based on a 3D-printed
diffractive network that creates at its output image plane a
spatially-repeating virtual spectral filter array with 2x2=4 unique bands at

power-efficient and polarization-insensitive forward operation, diffractive
multispectral imagers can be transformative for various imaging and sensing
applications and be used at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum

posted on-chain to be disputed by any party via an interactive fraud proof
(IFP) protocol. Existing systems that utilize this technique have demonstrated
up to a 20x reduction in transaction fees. The most popular ORUs today, in
active development, strive to extend existing Ethereum client software to
support IFP construction, aiming to reuse prior L1 engineering efforts and
replicate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) semantics at L2. Unfortunately, to do
so they tightly couple their on-chain IFP verifier with a specific client
program binary--oblivious to its higher-level semantics. We argue that this
approach (1) precludes the trust-minimized, permissionless participation of
multiple Ethereum client programs, magnifying monoculture failure risk; (2)
leads to an unnecessarily large and complex trusted computing base that is
difficult to independently audit; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered,

complicating on-chain access control. In this work, we aim to build a secure,
trust-minimized ORU that addresses these problems, while preserving scalability

the EVM, that enforces Ethereum's specified semantics precisely at the level of
a single EVM instruction. We present Specular, an ORU which leverages an

due to the limited diversity of image-mesh pairs in multi-view training data.
To address this shortcoming, people have explored the use of synthetic images.
But besides the usual impact of visual gap between rendered and target data,
synthetic-data-driven multi-view estimators also suffer from overfitting to the

from real-world distributions. Tackling both challenges, we propose a novel

(a) relies on intermediate 2D representations which are more robust to

triangulation to adapt to more diversified camera setups; and (c) progressively
aggregates multi-view information in a canonical 3D space to remove ambiguities

For a pair of graphs, the QESK kernel is defined by computing the
exponentiation of the negative Euclidean distance between their entropic

proposed QESK can discriminate the distinctions of isomorphic subtrees in terms

distribution of the behavior policy. However, this approach has been shown to
suffer from the distribution mismatch issue, and therefore significant efforts
are needed for correcting this mismatch either via state distribution
correction or a counterfactual method. In this paper, we rethink off-policy
learning via Coordinate Ascent Policy Optimization (CAPO), an off-policy
actor-critic algorithm that decouples policy improvement from the state
distribution of the behavior policy without using the policy gradient. This
design obviates the need for distribution correction or importance sampling in
the policy improvement step of off-policy policy gradient. We establish the
global convergence of CAPO with general coordinate selection and then further
quantify the convergence rates of several instances of CAPO with popular
coordinate selection rules, including the cyclic and the randomized variants of
CAPO. We then extend CAPO to neural policies for a more practical
implementation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that CAPO provides a
competitive approach to RL in practice.

mechanism and radiation process in these enigma phenomena are still highly
controversial. In this study, we build a sample of 16 repeating FRBs from which
at least five bursts have been detected, including the most active four
repeaters of FRBs 20121102A, 20180916B, 20190520B and 20201124A. Various key
parameters of their bursts are collected from the literature, which include the
trigger time, pulse width, dispersion measure (DM), Faraday rotation measure
(RM), bandwidth, waiting time, peak flux and fluence. The distribution and time
evolution of these parameters are investigated. Potential correlations between
various parameter pairs are also extensively explored. The behaviors of
different repeaters are then compared. It is found that the DM of FRB 20121102A
seems to increase continuously on a long timescale. While the $DM$ of most
repeaters varies in a narrow range of $\pm 3$ cm$^{-3}$ pc, FRB 20190520B is
found to have a large variation range of $\pm 12$ cm$^{-3}$ pc. A linear
correlation between $DM$ and the star formation rate is established. $RM$
evolves with time in a much more chaos behavior in different repeaters.
Generally, the waiting time shows a bimodal distribution in each source. The
implications of these features to the underlying physics are discussed.

The recently introduced notion of robust reachability aims at filling this gap

Yet, this qualitative notion may be too strong in practice, leaving apart bugs
which are mostly but not fully replicable. We aim here at proposing a
quantitative version of robust reachability, more flexible and still amenable
to automation. We propose quantitative robustness, a metric expressing how
easily an attacker can trigger a bug while taking into account that he can only
influence part of the program input, together with a dedicated quantitative

transitions between the bi-temporal RSIs. Then, we introduce a semantic
learning scheme to leverage the spatio-temporal constraints, which are coherent
to the SCD task, to guide the learning of semantic changes. The resulting
network (SCanNet) significantly outperforms the baseline method in terms of
both detection of critical semantic changes and semantic consistency in the
obtained bi-temporal results. It achieves the SOTA accuracy on two benchmark

in chemical vapor deposited 1L-MoS$_{2}$. Temperature dependent polarization
resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was carried out on as-grown,
transferred and capped samples. It has been found that the momentum scattering
of the excitons due to the sulfur-vacancies attached with air-molecule defects
has a strong influence on the valley de-polarization process. Our study reveals
that at sufficiently low densities of such defects and temperatures, long range
electron-hole exchange mediated intervalley transfer due to momentum scattering
via Maialle-Silva-Sham (MSS) mechanism of excitons is indeed the most dominant
spin-flip process as suggested by T. Yu et al. The rate of momentum scattering
of the excitons due to these defects is found to be proportional to the cube
root of the density of the defects. Intervalley transfer process of excitons
involving $\Gamma$-valley also has significance in the valley de-polarization
process specially when the layer has tensile strain or high density of $V_S$
defects as these perturbations reduce $K$ to $\Gamma$-energy separation.
Band-structural calculations carried out within the density functional theory
framework validate this finding. Experimental results further suggest that
exchange interactions with the physisorbed air molecules can also result in the
intervalley spin-flip scattering of the excitons, and this process gives an
important contribution to valley depolarization, specially at the strong
scattering regime.

technology as a promising, low-cost approach to accurately solving the X-ray

different combinations of modulator materials and thicknesses, we present a
practical design of a mixed two-dimensional spectral modulator that can
generate multi-energy blended CBCT spectral projections. To deal with the
twisted scatter-spectral challenge, we propose a novel scatter-decoupled

reveal sensitive social interactions in the local view, applying differential
privacy in the data collection process is often desirable, which provides
strong and rigorous privacy guarantees. In practical decentralized social
graphs, different edges have different privacy requirements due to the distinct
sensitivity levels. However, the existing differentially private analysis of
social graphs provide the same protection for all edges. To address this issue,
this work proposes a fine-grained privacy notion as well as novel algorithms
for private graph analysis. We first design a fine-grained relationship
differential privacy (FGR-DP) notion for social graph analysis, which enforces
different protections for the edges with distinct privacy requirements. Then,
we design algorithms for triangle counting and k-stars counting, respectively,
which can accurately estimate subgraph counts given fine-grained protection for
social edges. We also analyze upper bounds on the estimation error, including
k-stars and triangle counts, and show their superior performance compared with
the state-of-the-arts. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on two real

FGR-DP have better utility than the state-of-the-art mechanisms due to the

variety of physical systems, a wide class of quasilinear SPDEs and a good
number of fluid dynamic models is carried out in this work. The aim of this
work is to develop the large deviation theory for small Gaussian as well as
Poisson noise perturbations of the above class of SPDEs. We establish a
Wentzell-Freidlin type large deviation principle for the strong solutions to
such SPDEs perturbed by L\'evy noise in a suitable Polish space using a
variational representation (based on a weak convergence approach) for
nonnegative functionals of general Poisson random measures and Brownian
motions. The well-posedness of an associated deterministic control problem is
established by exploiting pseudo-monotonicity arguments and the stochastic
counterpart is obtained by an application of Girsanov's theorem.

linear representation of the underlying dynamical system, thus enabling the
user to use linear systems theory for analysis and control of the system; c) it
is computationally fast and less intensive than the popular Extended Dynamic

benchmarks, however, multisensors fusion-based techniques are promising to
further improve the results. PointPainting, as a recently proposed framework,
can add the semantic information from the 2D image into the 3D LiDAR point by
the painting operation to boost the detection performance. However, due to the
limited resolution of 2D feature maps, severe boundary-blurring effect happens
during re-projection of 2D semantic segmentation into the 3D point clouds. To
well handle this limitation, a general multimodal fusion framework MSF has been
proposed to fuse the semantic information from both the 2D image and 3D points
scene parsing results. Specifically, MSF includes three main modules. First,
SOTA off-the-shelf 2D/3D semantic segmentation approaches are employed to
generate the parsing results for 2D images and 3D point clouds. The 2D semantic
information is further re-projected into the 3D point clouds with calibrated
parameters. To handle the misalignment between the 2D and 3D parsing results,
an AAF module is proposed to fuse them by learning an adaptive fusion score.
Then the point cloud with the fused semantic label is sent to the following 3D
object detectors. Furthermore, we propose a DFF module to aggregate deep
features in different levels to boost the final detection performance. The
effectiveness of the framework has been verified on two public large-scale 3D
object detection benchmarks by comparing with different baselines. The
experimental results show that the proposed fusion strategies can significantly
improve the detection performance compared to the methods using only point
clouds and the methods using only 2D semantic information. Most importantly,
the proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches and sets new
SOTA results on the nuScenes testing benchmark.

simulations of Navier-Stokes flows. The literature contains studies of similar
isoviscous fluid systems, where the two fluids have the same viscosity. Here we
extend this to the more general case where they have different viscosities. We
investigate the effect of the fluid viscosity ratio on the movement patterns of
microswimmers. We find that swimmers systematically reorientate towards the
region containing the lower viscosity fluid. Ultimately this is expected to
drive the swimmers to behave as if they are more inclined to swim in low
viscosity fluids. Furthermore, in addition to the types of swimming already
reported in the isoviscous system, i.e. bouncing, sliding and penetrating, we
observed a hovering motion, in which strong pullers swim parallel to the
interface with a certain distance, which is consistent with the dynamics of
such swimmers near the solid wall.

footprint. An alternative paradigm is retrieve-and-rerank, where documents are

retriever that jointly scores documents in the knowledge source and sentences

fuzzy sphere. I briefly review how the fuzzy two-sphere and its higher
dimensional cousins are realized in the (spherical) Landau models in
non-Abelian monopole backgrounds. For extracting quantum geometry from the
Landau models, we evaluate the matrix elements of the coordinates of spheres in
the lowest and higher Landau levels. For the lowest Landau level, the matrix
geometry is identified as the geometry of fuzzy sphere. Meanwhile for the
higher Landau levels, the obtained quantum geometry turns out to be a nested
matrix geometry with no classical counterpart. There exists a hierarchical
structure between the fuzzy geometries and the monopoles in different
dimensions. That dimensional hierarchy signifies a Landau model counterpart of
the dimensional ladder of quantum anomaly.

magnetic interactions are due to exchange of electrons [1-3]. Typically, only
the interaction between pairs of electrons' spins is considered to explain the
nature of the ground state and its excitations, whereas three-, four-, and
six-spin interactions are ignored. When these higher order processes occur in a
loop they are called cyclic or ring exchange. The ring-exchange interaction is
required to explain low temperature behavior in bulk and thin films of solid
$^3$He [4-8]. It also plays a crucial role in the quantum magnet La$_2$CuO$_4$
[9,10]. Here, we use a combination of time domain THz (TDTS) and magneto-Raman
spectroscopies to measure the low energy magnetic excitations in CoTiO$_3$, a
proposed Dirac topological magnon material [11,12] where the origin of the
energy gap in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center remains unclear.
We measured the magnetic field dependence of the energies of the two lowest
energy magnons and determine that the gap opens due to the ring-exchange
interaction between the six spins in a hexagon. This interaction also explains
the selection rules of the THz magnon absorption. Finally, we clarify that
topological surface magnons are not expected in CoTiO$_3$. Our study
demonstrates the power of combining TDTS and Raman spectroscopies with theory
to identify the microscopic origins of the magnetic excitations in quantum
magnets.

respect to a timing model. This spatial correlation, which in the case of the
gravitational wave background must have the form described by the Hellings and
Downs function, has not yet been observed. Therefore, despite the numerous
hints of a common red noise in the timing residuals of many millisecond pulsars
compatible with that expected for the gravitational wave background, its
detection has not yet been achieved. By now, the reason is not completely clear
and, from some recent works, the urgency to adopt new detection techniques,
possibly complementary to the standard one, is emerging clearly. Of course,
this demand also applies to the detection of continuous gravitational waves
emitted by supermassive black hole binaries populating the Universe. In the
latter case, important information could, in principle, emerge from the
millisecond pulsars considered individually in a single-pulsar search of
continuous GWs. In this context, the surfing effect can then be exploited,
helping to select the best pulsars to carry out such analysis. This paper aims
to clarify when the surfing effect occurs and describe it exhaustively. A
possible application to the case of the supermassive black hole binary
candidate PKS 2131-021 and millisecond pulsar J2145-0750 is also analyzed.

of explanatory variables on the installed capacity of adopter municipalities
(N=223) in an OLS model. Second, we use a logit model to analyze whether the
identified relationships are also apparent between adopter and non-adopter
municipalities (N=423). Our findings suggest that fiscal capacity (measured by
per capita debt and per capita tax revenue) and peer effects (measured by the
pre-existing installed capacity) are positively associated with both the
installed capacity and adoption. Furthermore, we find that institutional

show a significant positive but small effect in both regression models. No

positioning and distance estimation (DE) systems due to its decimeter-level
accuracy achieved when using time-of-flight-based techniques. Techniques for DE
relying on signal strength (DESS) received less attention. As a consequence,
existing benchmarks consist of simple channel characterizations rather than
methods aiming to increase accuracy. Further development in DESS may enable
lower-cost transceivers to applications that can afford lower accuracies than
those based on time-of-flight. Moreover, it is a fundamental building block
used by a recently proposed approach that can enable security against
cyberattacks on DE which could not be avoided using only time-of-flight-based

machine-learning models trained in different real-world environments to
increase UWB-based DESS accuracy. Additionally, aiming for implementation in
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) transceivers, we propose and evaluate an
approach to resolve ambiguities comprising DESS in these devices. Our results
show that the proposed DE approaches have sub-decimeter accuracy when testing
the models in the same environment and positions in which they have been

estimation, all samples must be measured since each independent sample contains
the same quantum Fisher information. In postselected metrology, postselection
can concentrate the quantum Fisher information of the initial samples into a
tiny post-selected sub-ensemble. It has been proven that this quantum advantage
can not be realized in any classically commuting theory. In this work, we
present that the advantage of postselection in weak value amplification (WVA)
can not be achieved without quantum coherence. The quantum coherence of the
initial system is closely related to the preparation costs and measurement
costs in parameter estimation. With the increase of initial quantum coherence,
the joint values of preparation costs and measurement costs can be optimized to
smaller. Moreover, we derive an analytical tradeoff relation between the
preparation, measurement and the quantum coherence. We further experimentally
test the tradeoff relation in a linear optical setup. The experimental and
theoretical results are in good agreement and show that the quantum coherence
plays a key role in bounding the resource costs in the postselected metrology
process.

Team structure, Interaction style among agents, and the system's Computational
characteristics. Under these core aspects, we present five attributes of HRI
systems, namely Team size, Team composition, Interaction model, Communication
modalities, and Robot control. These attributes are used to characterize and
distinguish one system from another. We populate resulting categories with
examples from recent literature along with a brief discussion of their
applications and analyze how these attributes differ from the case of dyadic
human-robot systems. We summarize key observations from the current literature,
and identify challenges and promising areas for future research in this domain.
In order to realize the vision of robots being part of the society and
interacting seamlessly with humans, there is a need to expand research on
multi-human -- multi-robot systems. Not only do these systems require
coordination among several agents, they also involve multi-agent and indirect
interactions which are absent from dyadic HRI systems. Adding multiple agents
in HRI systems requires advanced interaction schemes, behavior understanding
and control methods to allow natural interactions among humans and robots. In
addition, research on human behavioral understanding in mixed human-robot teams

strategy for building up active optical components to be used as sensors,

recently as powerful optical tools for the manipulation of light-matter
interaction and for building sensors/actuators. These emerge at the interface
between a dielectric mirror and a plasmonic layer and, interestingly, can be
excited at normal incidence angle with relatively high quality factors.
Although its field is located at the interface between the dielectric mirror
and the metal, recent studies have demonstrated that corrugation at the
nanoscale permits to access the TP mode from the outside, opening new exciting
perspectives for many real-life applications. Here, we show that the TP
resonance obtained by capping a distributed Bragg reflector with a
nanostructured layer of silver is sensitive to the presence of bacteria. We
observed that nanoscale corrugation is essential for accessing the TP field,
while the well-known bio-responsivity of silver nanostructures renders such a
localised mode sensible to the presence of Escherichia Coli. Electrodoping
experiments confirm the pivotal role of nanostructuration, as well as
strengthening our hypothesis that the modifications of the TP mode upon
exposure to bacteria are related to the accumulation of negative charge due to
the bacterial-driven removal of Ag+ ions from its lattice. Finally, we devised
a case study in which we disentangled optically the presence of proliferative
and non-proliferative bacteria using the TP resonance as a read-out, thus
making these devices as promising simple all-optical probes for bacterial
metabolic activity, including their response against drugs and antibiotics.

taking account of the non-linear energy harvesting model and outage probability
criterion. Since the coupling of optimization variables, the whole optimization
problem is non-convex and cannot be solved directly. Therefore, the alternating

incorporate residual coding to mitigate the degradation arising from
quantization distortion at the latent space. Results indicate that achieving
the same performance, the proposed method saves up to 27% coding rate than
widely used adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) codec as well as emerging
neural waveform coding methods.

Palomar-Green quasar host galaxies to investigate their ongoing star formation
at $\sim$kpc-scale resolution. The AGN contribution to the cold dust emission
and the optical emission-line flux is carefully removed to derive spatial
distributions of the star formation rate (SFR), which, complemented with the
molecular gas data, enables the mapping of the depletion time ($t_{\rm dep}$).
We report ubiquitous star formation activity within the quasar host galaxies,
with the majority of the ongoing star formation occurring in the galaxy center.
The rise of the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) toward
the nucleus is steeper than that observed for the cold molecular gas surface
density, reaching values up to $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \approx
0.15-0.80\,M_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}\,$kpc$^{-2}$. The gas in the nuclear regions is
converted into stars at a shortened depletion time ($t_{\rm dep} \approx
0.2-2.0\,$Gyr), suggesting that those zones can be deemed as starbursts. At
large galactocentric radius, we find that the ongoing star formation takes
place within spiral arms or H$\,$II region complexes, with an efficiency
comparable to that reported for nearby inactive spirals ($t_{\rm dep} \approx
1.8\,$Gyr). We find no evidence of star formation activity shutoff in the PG
quasar host galaxies. On the contrary, these observations shed light on how the
central environments of galaxies hosting actively accreting supermassive black
holes builds up stellar mass.

${\mathcal B}(\Sigma^+ \to \Lambda e^+ \nu_{e}) = [2.93\pm0.74(\rm stat) \pm
0.13(\rm syst)]\times 10^{-5}$, which is the most precise measurement obtained
in a single experiment to date and also the first result obtained at a collider

$\Sigma^{\pm}$, the ratio, $\frac{\Gamma(\Sigma^- \to \Lambda e^-

matrix $D(G)$ of $G$ has rows and columns indexed by $V(G)$ with $uv$-entry

$\mathrm{trs}(u)$ of $u$ is defined as $\sum_{v\in V(G)}\mathrm{dist}(u,v)$.
Let $\mathrm{trs}(G)$ be the diagonal matrix with the transmissions of the
vertices of $G$ in the diagonal, and $\mathrm{deg}(G)$ the diagonal matrix with
the degrees of the vertices in the diagonal. In this paper we investigate the
Smith normal form (SNF) and the spectrum of the matrices

$D^{\mathrm{deg}}(G):=\mathrm{deg}(G)-D(G)$,
$A^{\mathrm{trs}}_+(G):=\mathrm{trs}(G)+A(G)$ and
$A^{\mathrm{trs}}(G):=\mathrm{trs}(G)-A(G)$. In particular, we explore how good
the spectrum and the SNF of these matrices are for determining graphs up to

behaviour when compared with other classical matrices. We note that the SNF of
$A^{\mathrm{trs}}$ can be used to compute the structure of the sandpile group
of certain graphs. We compute the SNF of $D^{\mathrm{deg}}_+$,
$D^{\mathrm{deg}}$, $A^{\mathrm{trs}}_+$ and $A^{\mathrm{trs}}$ for several
graph families. We prove that complete graphs are determined by the SNF of

  for Reinforcement Learning","submitted to IJCNN 2022",,,,"cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enable agents to learn complex tasks.
However, it is difficult to interpret the knowledge and reuse it across tasks.
Inductive biases can address such issues by explicitly providing generic yet
useful decomposition that is otherwise difficult or expensive to learn
implicitly. For example, object-centered approaches decompose a high
dimensional observation into individual objects. Expanding on this, we utilize
an inductive bias for explicit object-centered knowledge separation that
provides further decomposition into semantic representations and dynamics
knowledge. For this, we introduce a semantic module that predicts an objects'
semantic state based on its context. The resulting affordance-like object state
can then be used to enrich perceptual object representations. With a minimal
setup and an environment that enables puzzle-like tasks, we demonstrate the
feasibility and benefits of this approach. Specifically, we compare three
different methods of integrating semantic representations into a model-based RL
architecture. Our experiments show that the degree of explicitness in knowledge
separation correlates with faster learning, better accuracy, better
generalization, and better interpretability.

  Existence and Static Subsistence","11 pages, 21 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  According to the software engineering community, the acknowledgement is
growing that a theory of software development is needed to integrate the
currently myriad popular methodologies, some of which are based on opposing
perspectives. Conceptual modeling (CM) can contribute to such a theory. CM
defines fundamental concepts to create representations of reality to achieve
ontologically sound software behavior that is characterized by truthfulness to
reality and conceptual clarity. In this context, CM is founded on theories
about the world that serve to represent a given domain. Ontologies have made
their way into CM as tools in requirements analysis, implementation
specification, and software architecture. This paper involves building a direct
connection between reality and CM by establishing mapping between reality and
modeling thinging machines (TMs). Specifically, Stoic ontology serves to define
the existence of TM things and actions in reality. Such a development would
benefit CM in addition to demonstrating that classical concepts in philosophy
can be applied to modern fields of study. The TM model includes static and
dynamic specifications. The dynamic level involves time-based events that can
be mapped to reality. The problem concerns the nature of a time-less static
description, which provides regions where the actions in events take place;
without them, the dynamic description collapses. The Stoics came up with a
brilliant move: the assumed reality to be a broader category than being.
Reality is made of things that exist and things that subsist. In this case, the
dynamic TM description is in existence, whereas the static, mapped portion of
the dynamic description is in subsistence. We apply such ontology to a contract
workflow example. The result seems to open a new avenue of CM that may enhance
the theoretical foundation for software and system development.

  Recognition via Reinforcement Learning","Accepted by AAAI2023",,,,"cs.SD cs.CV cs.MM eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) has gained remarkable success for
ameliorating the noise-robustness of speech recognition. Mainstream methods
focus on fusing audio and visual inputs to obtain modality-invariant
representations. However, such representations are prone to over-reliance on
audio modality as it is much easier to recognize than video modality in clean
conditions. As a result, the AVSR model underestimates the importance of visual
stream in face of noise corruption. To this end, we leverage visual
modality-specific representations to provide stable complementary information
for the AVSR task. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based
framework called MSRL, where the agent dynamically harmonizes
modality-invariant and modality-specific representations in the auto-regressive
decoding process. We customize a reward function directly related to
task-specific metrics (i.e., word error rate), which encourages the MSRL to
effectively explore the optimal integration strategy. Experimental results on
the LRS3 dataset show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art in
both clean and various noisy conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the better
generality of MSRL system than other baselines when test set contains unseen

gave a combinatorial interpretation for the generating function of $A_{n,i,j}$,

Subsequently, Petersen asked whether there is a visual way to understand this
recurrence. In this paper, after observing the internal structures of
permutation grids, we present a combinatorial proof of the recurrence of
$A_{n,i,j}$. Let $I_{n,k}$ and $J_{n,k}$ count the number of involutions and
fixed-point free involutions on $[n]$ with $k$ descents, respectively. With the

generalising previous results on the subject by Aspinwall and Morrison. Since
the T-dualities arise from a circle reduction one can exploit the duality
between F-theory and M-theory to explore a larger moduli space, where
T-dualities are realised as inequivalent elliptic fibrations of the same

Calabi-Yau we consider admit a nested elliptic K3 fibration structure. This is
central for our construction: the K3 fibrations determine the flavor groups and
their global forms, and are the key to identify various T-dualities. We remark
that this method works also more generally for LSTs arising from non-geometric
Heterotic backgrounds. We study a first example in detail: a particularly
exotic class of LSTs which are built from extremal K3 surfaces that admit
flavor groups with maximal rank 18. We find all models are related by a
so-called T-hexality (i.e. a 6-fold family of T-dualities) which we predict

design control strategies focused on minimizing transmission chains. Here we
introduce a compartmental model for Xf-caused diseases in Europe that accounts
for the main relevant epidemiological processes, including the seasonal
dynamics of P. spumarius. The model was confronted with epidemiological data
from the two major outbreaks of Xf in Europe, the olive quick disease syndrome
(OQDS) in Apulia, Italy, caused by the subspecies pauca, and the almond leaf
scorch disease (ALSD) in Majorca, Spain, caused by subspecies multiplex and
fastidiosa. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we show how the model
successfully reproduces the general field data in both diseases. In a global
sensitivity analysis, the vector-plant and plant-vector transmission rates,
together with the vector removal rate, were the most influential parameters in
determining the time of the infected host population peak, the incidence peak
and the final number of dead hosts. We also used our model to check different
vector-based control strategies, showing that a joint strategy focused on
increasing the rate of vector removal while lowering the number of annual

with numerous applications. Recently, LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved
remarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However, significant
errors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities, i.e.,
depth edges, which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications
that are sensitive to such inaccuracies, e.g., novel view synthesis and
augmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is
typically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes, encouraging the MDE model
to produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. In this work we propose
to learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised
synthetic data, and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the
MDE training. %Despite the 'domain gap' between synthetic and real data, we
show that depth edges that are estimated directly are significantly more
accurate than the ones that emerge indirectly from the MDE training. To
quantitatively evaluate our approach, and due to the lack of depth edges ground
truth in LIDAR-based scenes, we manually annotated subsets of the KITTI and the
DDAD datasets with depth edges ground truth. We demonstrate significant gains
in the accuracy of the depth edges with comparable per-pixel depth accuracy on
several challenging datasets.

and correlation matrices are semi-positive definite (SPD) matrices residing on
a cone-shape Riemannian manifold. Despite its remarkable success for
Euclidean-valued data generation, use of standard generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to generate manifold-valued FC data neglects its inherent SPD
structure and hence the inter-relatedness of edges in real FC. We propose a
novel graph-regularized manifold-aware conditional Wasserstein GAN (GR-SPD-GAN)
for FC data generation on the SPD manifold that can preserve the global FC
structure. Specifically, we optimize a generalized Wasserstein distance between
the real and generated SPD data under an adversarial training, conditioned on
the class labels. The resulting generator can synthesize new SPD-valued FC
matrices associated with different classes of brain networks, e.g., brain
disorder or healthy control. Furthermore, we introduce additional population
graph-based regularization terms on both the SPD manifold and its tangent space
to encourage the generator to respect the inter-subject similarity of FC
patterns in the real data. This also helps in avoiding mode collapse and
produces more stable GAN training. Evaluated on resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of major depressive disorder (MDD),
qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed GR-SPD-GAN clearly
outperforms several state-of-the-art GANs in generating more realistic
fMRI-based FC samples. When applied to FC data augmentation for MDD
identification, classification models trained on augmented data generated by
our approach achieved the largest margin of improvement in classification
accuracy among the competing GANs over baselines without data augmentation.

Our model is based on a Merton's portfolio and consumption problem, where, in

the agent's mortality force, so that investment into healthcare reduces the
agent's mortality risk. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as a
stochastic control-stopping problem with a random time-horizon and
state-variables given by the agent's wealth and health capital. We transform
this problem into its dual version, which is now a two-dimensional optimal
stopping problem with interconnected dynamics and finite time-horizon.
Regularity of the optimal stopping value function is derived and the related
free boundary surface is proved to be Lipschitz continuous and it is
characterized as the unique solution to a nonlinear integral equation. In the
original coordinates, the agent thus invests into healthcare whenever her
wealth exceeds an age- and health-dependent transformed version of the optimal

Our design incorporates a cascade downsampling mechanism which allows us to
obtain multiple quantized networks from one full precision source model by
progressively mapping the higher precision weights to their adjacent lower
precision counterparts. Then, with networks of different bit-widths from one
source model, multi-objective optimization is employed to train the shared
source model weights such that they can be updated simultaneously, considering
the performance of all networks. By doing this, the shared weights will be
optimized to balance the performance of different quantized models, thus making
the weights transferable among different bit widths. Experiments show that the
proposed vertical-layered representation and developed once QAT scheme are
effective in embodying multiple quantized networks into a single one and allow
one-time training, and it delivers comparable performance as that of quantized
models tailored to any specific bit-width. Code will be available.

  package",,,,,"q-bio.PE stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BEF studies aim to understand how ecosystems respond to a gradient of species
diversity. Diversity-Interactions (DI) models are suitable for analysing the
BEF relationship. These models relate an ecosystem function response of a
community to the identity of the species in the community, their evenness
(proportions) and interactions. The number of species in the community
(richness) is also implicitly modelled through this approach. It is common in
BEF studies to model an ecosystem function as a function of richness; while
this can uncover trends in the BEF relationship, by definition, species
diversity is much broader than richness alone, and important patterns in the
BEF relationship may remain hidden. In this paper, we introduce the DImodels R
package for implementing DI models. We also compare DI models to traditional
modelling approaches to highlight the advantages of using a multi-dimensional
definition of species diversity. We show that using DI models can lead to
considerably improved model fit over other methods; it does this by
incorporating variation due to the multiple facets of species diversity.
Predicting from a DI model is not limited to the study design points, the model
can extrapolate to predict for any species composition and proportions
(assuming there is sufficient coverage of this space in the study design).
Expressing the BEF relationship as a function of richness alone can be useful
to capture overall trends. However, collapsing the multiple dimensions of
species diversity to a single dimension (such as richness) can result in
valuable ecological information being lost. DI modelling provides a framework
to test the multiple components of species diversity in the BEF relationship.
It facilitates uncovering a deeper ecological understanding of the BEF
relationship and can lead to enhanced inference.

effective distance measure, it is possible to perform classification,
clustering, anomaly detection, segmentation, etc. For single-event time series
Euclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping distance are known to be extremely
effective. However, for time series containing cyclical behaviors, the semantic
meaningfulness of such comparisons is less clear. For example, on two separate
days the telemetry from an athlete workout routine might be very similar. The
second day may change the order in of performing push-ups and squats, adding
repetitions of pull-ups, or completely omitting dumbbell curls. Any of these
minor changes would defeat existing time series distance measures. Some
bag-of-features methods have been proposed to address this problem, but we
argue that in many cases, similarity is intimately tied to the shapes of
subsequences within these longer time series. In such cases, summative features
will lack discrimination ability. In this work we introduce PRCIS, which stands
for Pattern Representation Comparison in Series. PRCIS is a distance measure
for long time series, which exploits recent progress in our ability to
summarize time series with dictionaries. We will demonstrate the utility of our
ideas on diverse tasks and datasets.

temperatures, this process can create luminescent emissions: the so-called glow

theory lets us develop a theoretical formalism, with explicit solutions for the
critical voltage effectively reproducing experimental Paschen curves. However,
most discharge processes occur in non-parallel plate geometries, such as
discharges between grains or ice particles in multiphase flows. Here, we
propose a generalization of the classic parallel plate configurations to
concentric spherical and coaxial cylindrical geometries in Earth, Mars, Titan,
and Venus atmospheres. In a spherical case, a small radius effectively
represents a sharp tip rod, while larger, centimeter-scale radii represents
rounded or blunted tips. Similarly, in a cylindrical case, a small radius would
correspond to a thin wire. We solve continuity equations in the gap and
estimate a critical radius and minimum breakdown voltage that allows ionization
of neutral gas and formation of a glow discharge. We show that glow coronae
form more easily in Mars's low-pressure, $CO_2$-rich atmosphere than in Earth's
high-pressure atmosphere. Additionally, we present breakdown criteria for Titan
and Venus. We further demonstrate that critical voltage minima occur at 0.5
cm$\cdot$Torr for all three investigated geometries, suggesting easier
initiation around millimeter-size particles in dust and water clouds and could
be readily extended to examine other multiphase flows with inertial particles.

properties of strongly-interacting matter produced in heavy-ion collision
experiments. Recently, there has been a significant advancement in this field
to explain the spin polarization of hadrons emitted in these processes.
Although current models have successfully explained some of the experimental
data based on spin-vorticity coupling, they still lack a clear understanding of
differential measurements. This is an indication that the spin needs to be
treated as an independent degree of freedom whose dynamics is not entirely
bound to flow circulation. In particular, if the spin is a macroscopic property
of the system, in equilibrium its dynamics should follow hydrodynamic laws. In
this thesis, we develop a framework of relativistic perfect-fluid hydrodynamics
which includes spin degrees of freedom from kinetic theory, and use it for
modeling the dynamics of matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Following experimental observations, we assume that the polarization effects
are small and derive conservation laws for net-baryon current, energy-momentum
tensor, and spin tensor based on the de Groot-van Leeuwen-van Weert
pseudogauge. Subsequently, we present various properties of the spin
polarization tensor and its components, analyze the propagation properties of
the spin polarization components, and derive the spin-wave velocity for
arbitrary statistics. We find that only the transverse spin components
propagate, analogously to the EM waves. Finally, we study the spacetime
evolution of spin polarization for the systems respecting certain spacetime
symmetries and calculate the mean spin polarization per particle, which can be
compared to the experimental data. We find that, for some observables, our spin
polarization results agree qualitatively with the experimental findings and
other model calculations.

data often exhibit complex patterns and significant data variability across
different locations. The labels in many real-world applications can also be
limited, which makes it difficult to separately train independent models for
different locations. Although meta learning has shown promise in model
adaptation with small samples, existing meta learning methods remain limited in
handling a large number of heterogeneous tasks, e.g., a large number of

task-adaptive formulations and a model-agnostic meta-learning framework that
ensembles regionally heterogeneous data into location-sensitive meta tasks. We
conduct task adaptation following an easy-to-hard task hierarchy in which
different meta models are adapted to tasks of different difficulty levels. One

generalization by automatically adapting the meta model of the corresponding

To tackle these problems, a data-driven approach using deep neural networks

generated by applying a prescribed rotation to the measurements. Although the
training data did not include recordings with real sensor rotations, tests on
data with real and synthetic rotations show similar results. An algorithm is
formulated for real-time deployment to detect and smooth transitions in device
mounting angle estimated by MountNet. MountNet is shown to find the mounting
angle rapidly which is critical in real-time applications. Our method converges
in less than 30 seconds of driving to a mean error of 4 degrees allowing a fast
calibration phase for other algorithms and applications. When the device is
rotated in the middle of a drive, large changes converge in 5 seconds and small
changes converge in less than 30 seconds.

  Networks","Accepted in ASE 2022",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has become a promising programming paradigm in software
development, owing to its surprising performance in solving many challenging
tasks. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in practice,
but are limited on resource-constrained devices owing to their demand for
computational power. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique to
reduce the size of DNNs with comparable accuracy as their floating-point
numbered counterparts. The resulting quantized neural networks (QNNs) can be
implemented energy-efficiently. Similar to their floating-point numbered
counterparts, quality assurance techniques for QNNs, such as testing and formal
verification, are essential but are currently less explored. In this work, we
propose a novel and efficient formal verification approach for QNNs. In
particular, we are the first to propose an encoding that reduces the
verification problem of QNNs into the solving of integer linear constraints,
which can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. Our encoding is both sound and
complete. We demonstrate the application of our approach on local robustness
verification and maximum robustness radius computation. We implement our
approach in a prototype tool QVIP and conduct a thorough evaluation.
Experimental results on QNNs with different quantization bits confirm the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, e.g., two orders of magnitude
faster and able to solve more verification tasks in the same time limit than
the state-of-the-art methods.

on machine recognition of work activities in industrial domains, in this study,
we introduce a new large-scale dataset for packaging work recognition called
OpenPack. OpenPack contains 53.8 hours of multimodal sensor data, including
keypoints, depth images, acceleration data, and readings from IoT-enabled
devices (e.g., handheld barcode scanners used in work procedures), collected
from 16 distinct subjects with different levels of packaging work experience.
On the basis of this dataset, we propose a neural network model designed to
recognize work activities, which efficiently fuses sensor data and readings
from IoT-enabled devices by processing them within different streams in a
ladder-shaped architecture, and the experiment showed the effectiveness of the
architecture. We believe that OpenPack will contribute to the community of
action/activity recognition with sensors. OpenPack dataset is available at

incorporation of computational psychiatry tasks and models into wider
mainstream research directions. These barriers include the time required for
participants to complete tasks, test-retest reliability, limited ecological
validity, as well as practical concerns, such as lack of computational
expertise and the expense and large sample sizes traditionally required to
validate tasks and models. We then discuss solutions, such as the redesigning
of tasks with a view toward feasibility, and the integration of tasks into more
ecologically valid and standardized game platforms that can be more easily
disseminated. Finally, we provide an example of how one task, the conditioned

magnetic structures that temporarily trap them and cause their trajectories to
display chaotic behavior, therefore modifying the simple diffusion scenario.
When CRs arrive at the Earth, they do so anisotropically. These chaotic effects
can be a fundamental contributor to this anisotropy. Accordingly, this requires
a comprehensive description of chaos in trapping conditions since assessing
their repercussions on the CR arrival directions is necessary. This study
utilizes a new method described in L\'opez-Barquero and Desiati (2021) to
characterize chaotic trajectories in bound systems. This method is based on the
Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), a quantity that determines the levels of
chaos based on the trajectories' divergence rate. The FTLE is useful since it
adapts to trapping conditions in magnetic structures or even propagating media
changes. Here, we explore the effects that chaos and trapping can have on the
TeV CR anisotropy. Concretely, we apply this method to study the behavior of
CRs entering the heliosphere. Specifically, how the distinct heliospheric
structures and CR impinging directions from the ISM can affect chaos levels.
The heliosphere has an intrinsic directionality that affects CRs differently
depending on where they enter it. This feature causes preferential directions
from which particles tend to be more chaotic than others. This eventually
translates into changes in the arrival maps which are not uniformly
distributed. Instead, we expect sectors in the map to change separately from
others, creating a time variation that could be detected. Consequently, this
result points to the idea that time-variability in the maps is essential to
understanding the CR anisotropy's overall processes.
