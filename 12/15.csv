simulate 2+1D lattice compact quantum electrodynamics with finite density
dynamical fermions. The gauge field is represented by a neural network which
parameterizes a discretized flow-based transformation of the amplitude while
the fermionic sign structure is represented by a neural net backflow. This
approach directly represents the $U(1)$ degree of freedom without any
truncation, obeys Guass's law by construction, samples autoregressively
avoiding any equilibration time, and variationally simulates Gauge-Fermion
systems with sign problems accurately. In this model, we investigate
confinement and string breaking phenomena in different fermion density and
hopping regimes. We study the phase transition from the charge crystal phase to
the vacuum phase at zero density, and observe the phase seperation and the net
charge penetration blocking effect under magnetic interaction at finite
density. In addition, we investigate a magnetic phase transition due to the
competition effect between the kinetic energy of fermions and the magnetic
energy of the gauge field. With our method, we further note potential
differences on the order of the phase transitions between a continuous $U(1)$
system and one with finite truncation. Our state-of-the-art neural network
approach opens up new possibilities to study different gauge theories coupled
to dynamical matter in higher dimensions.

Einstein-Hilbert action, and evaluate its effect on the spectrum of the scalar
mode that triggers the Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings in five
dimensional General Relativity. After studying some properties of the static
black string, we provide the correction to the Lichnerowicz operator up to
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$. For the scalar mode of the gravitational perturbation,
we find a master variable and study its spectrum, providing an analysis of the
regime of validity of our scheme. We show that the instability persists under
the inclusion of the $R^2$-correction, and that the critical wavelength
increases with the value of $\alpha/r_+^2<<1$, providing new evidence of the
phenomenon which was already observed in other approaches. We also construct
the boosted black strings and compute the correction to the mass, the momentum
and the tension due to the higher curvature term. The presence of the
dimensionful coupling $\alpha$ spoils the validity of the Smarr relation, which
is the gravitational version of the Euler relation which must hold for every
homogeneous, thermodynamic system. We show that this identity can be restored
by working in an extended thermodynamic setup that includes variations of the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling.

engulfs its companion, its core and the companion temporarily orbit each other
inside a common envelope. Drag forces transfer orbital energy and angular
momentum to the envelope material. Depending on the efficiency of this process,
the envelope may be ejected leaving behind a tight remnant binary system of two
stellar cores, or the cores merge retaining part of the envelope material. The
exact outcome of common-envelope evolution is critical for in the formation of
X-ray binaries, supernova progenitors, the progenitors of compact-object
mergers that emit detectable gravitational waves, and many other objects of
fundamental astrophysical relevance. The wide ranges of spatial and temporal
timescales that characterize common-envelope interactions and the lack of
spatial symmetries present a substantial challenge to generating consistent
models. Therefore, these critical phases are one of the largest sources for
uncertainty in classical treatments of binary stellar evolution.
Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of at least part of the common
envelope interaction are the key to gain predictive power in modeling
common-envelope evolution. We review the development of theoretical concepts
and numerical approaches for such three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.
The inherent multi-physics, multi-scale challenges have resulted in a wide
variety of approximations and numerical techniques to be exercised on the
problem. We summarize the simulations published to date and their main results.
Given the recent rapid progress, a sound understanding of the physics of
common-envelope interactions is within reach and thus there is hope that one of
the remaining fundamental problems of stellar astrophysics may be solved before
long.

are commonly encountered and should be analyzed with careful consideration of
these features from a statistical perspective. Small deviations from an assumed
model, such as the presence of outliers, can cause classical regression
procedures to break down, potentially leading to unreliable inferences. Other
distributional deviations, such as heteroscedasticity, can be handled by going
beyond the mean and modelling the scale parameter in terms of covariates. We
propose a method that accounts for heavy tails and heteroscedasticity through
the use of a generalized normal distribution (GND). The GND contains a
kurtosis-characterizing shape parameter that moves the model smoothly between
the normal distribution and the heavier-tailed Laplace distribution - thus
covering both classical and robust regression. A key component of statistical
inference is determining the set of covariates that influence the response
variable. While correctly accounting for kurtosis and heteroscedasticity is
crucial to this endeavour, a procedure for variable selection is still
required. For this purpose, we use a novel penalized estimation procedure that
avoids the typical computationally demanding grid search for tuning parameters.
This is particularly valuable in the distributional regression setting where
the location and scale parameters depend on covariates, since the standard
approach would have multiple tuning parameters (one for each distributional
parameter). We achieve this by using a ""smooth information criterion"" that can
be optimized directly, where the tuning parameters are fixed at log(n) in the
BIC case.

considered. Furthermore, we also conceive the uplink counterpart of our HTBF
scheme, which is based on maximizing the signal-tointerference-plus noise ratio
(SINR) of each individual user. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed schemes
is characterized by our extensive simulation results in terms of cancelling the
interuser/intergroup interference, which improves the spectral efficiency.

on a source of interest in a complex acoustic scene, is a long standing goal of
audio source separation research. Much of this research investigates separating
speech from noise, speech from speech, musical instruments from each other, or
sound events from each other. In this paper, we focus on the cocktail fork
problem, which takes a three-pronged approach to source separation by
separating an audio mixture such as a movie soundtrack or podcast into the
three broad categories of speech, music, and sound effects (SFX - understood to
include ambient noise and natural sound events). We benchmark the performance
of several deep learning-based source separation models on this task and
evaluate them with respect to simple objective measures such as
signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) as well as objective metrics that better
correlate with human perception. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate how source
separation can influence downstream transcription tasks. First, we investigate
the task of activity detection on the three sources as a way to both further
improve source separation and perform transcription. We formulate the
transcription tasks as speech recognition for speech and audio tagging for
music and SFX. We observe that, while the use of source separation estimates
improves transcription performance in comparison to the original soundtrack,
performance is still sub-optimal due to artifacts introduced by the separation
process. Therefore, we thoroughly investigate how remixing of the three
separated source stems at various relative levels can reduce artifacts and
consequently improve the transcription performance. We find that remixing music
and SFX interferences at a target SNR of 17.5 dB reduces speech recognition
word error rate, and similar impact from remixing is observed for tagging music
and SFX content.

safety-critical applications. In this work, we focus on capturing the
data-inherent uncertainty (aka aleatoric uncertainty) in segmentation,
typically when ambiguities exist in input images. Due to the high-dimensional
output space and potential multiple modes in segmenting ambiguous images, it
remains challenging to predict well-calibrated uncertainty for segmentation. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel mixture of stochastic experts (MoSE)
model, where each expert network estimates a distinct mode of the aleatoric
uncertainty and a gating network predicts the probabilities of an input image
being segmented in those modes. This yields an efficient two-level uncertainty
representation. To learn the model, we develop a Wasserstein-like loss that
directly minimizes the distribution distance between the MoSE and ground truth
annotations. The loss can easily integrate traditional segmentation quality
measures and be efficiently optimized via constraint relaxation. We validate
our method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and a modified multimodal Cityscapes
dataset. Results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art or
competitive performance on all metrics.

can act as a fluidic fuse: during radially outward fluid flow, the solid
deforms in response to the viscous pressure field such that the gap expands
near the inlet (at the centre) and contracts near the outlet (around the rim).
If the flow rate exceeds a critical value, the gap at the outlet can close
completely, interrupting/choking the flow. Here, we consider the injection of
gas into such a soft-walled Hele-Shaw cell filled with viscous liquid. Our
theoretical model and numerical simulations for axisymmetric flow driven by the
injection of an expanding gas bubble show that the bubble increases the
critical flow rate of choking via two mechanisms. Firstly, as the interface
approaches the rim, it reduces the length over which the viscous pressure
gradient deforms the solid, which increases the critical flow rate above which
choking occurs. Secondly, compression of the gas reduces the outlet flow rate
relative to the inlet flow rate. As a consequence, for large injection rates, a
near-choking regime is established in which the outlet flow rate becomes
independent of the injection rate and instead depends only on the instantaneous
position of the interface. Our travelling-wave model for the advancement of the
bubble front will enable future reduced-order modelling of non-axisymmetric
problems, such as viscous fingering.

maximum (FWHM) of the cross-correlation function (CCF) to model the planetary
and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian process regression

with a minimum mass $m_p \sin i $ of 1.08 $\pm$ 0.13 M$_{\oplus}$ with an
orbital period of 10.3465 $\pm$ 0.0027 days at a distance of 0.0457 $\pm$

the star, with a period of 126 $\pm$ 15 days.
  GJ~1002 is one of the few known nearby systems with planets that could
potentially host habitable environments. The closeness of the host star to the

$\sim$ 15.7 mas, respectively) large enough for their atmosphere to be studied
via high-contrast high-resolution spectroscopy with instruments such as the

Differently from the literature, and to keep the overall complexity affordable,
we assume that RIS optimization is performed less frequently than localization
and precoding adaptation. The proposed procedure leads to minimize the inverse
of the received power in the UE position uncertainty area between two
subsequent optimization steps.
  The optimal RIS and precoder strategy are compared with the classical
beam-focusing strategy and with a scheme that maximizes the communication rate.
It is shown that if the RISs are optimized for communications, their
configuration is suboptimal when used for tracking purposes.
  Numerical results show that in typical indoor environments with only one BS

range of less than half a meter can be achieved.

droplets from a substrate with complex three-dimensional structures. However,
our understanding of interfacial phenomena including droplet wetting dynamics
and phase changes on engineered surfaces remains elusive, impeding dexterous
designs for agile droplet purging. Here we present a surface topography
strategy to modulate droplet jumping behaviors on micropillared substrates at
moderate superheat of 20-30 {\deg}C. Specifically, sessile droplets usually
dwell in the Wenzel state and therefore the micropillar matrix functions as fin
array for heat transfer enhancement. By tuning the feature sizes of
micropillars, one can adjust the vapor bubble growth at the droplet base from
the heat-transfer-controlled mode to the inertia-controlled mode. As opposed to
the relatively slow vibration jumping in seconds, the vapor bubble growth in
the inertia-controlled mode on tall-micropillared surface leads to droplet
out-of-plane jumping in milliseconds. Such rapid droplet detachment stems from
the swift Wenzel-to Cassie transition incurred by vapor bubble burst
(explosion), during which the bubble expanding velocity can reach as fast as ~4
m/s. Vapor bubble growth in a droplet and bubble-burst-induced droplet jumping
have been less explored. This study unveils the underpinning mechanisms of
versatile jumping behaviors of boiling droplets from a hot micro-structured
surface and opens up further possibilities for the design of engineered

artifacts while sharpening filters are for enhancing details. To aggregate a
new hidden state that contains fewer artifacts from the hidden state pool, we
devise a Selective Cross Attention (SCA) module, in which the attention between
input features and each hidden state is calculated. Equipped with HSA, our

stellar mass, the gradual increase of the cosmic ray mass number observed on
Earth from $\simeq$2\:EeV up to the highest energies is shown to call for
nuclei accelerated up to an energy proportional to their electric charge and
emitted with a hard spectral index. In addition, the inferred flux of protons
down to $\simeq$0.6\:EeV is shown to require for this population a spectral
index significantly softer than that of heavier nuclei. This is consistent with
in-source interactions that shape the energy production rate of injected
charged nuclei differently from that of the secondary neutrons escaping from
the confinement zone. Together with the inferred abundances of nuclei, these

that post-mergers are 3-4 times more likely to experience a luminous active
galactic nuclei (AGN) phase than isolated galaxies. SMBH accretion rate
enhancements persist for ~2 Gyrs after coalescence, significantly exceeding the
~500 Myr lifetime of star formation rate enhancements. We find that the
presence of simultaneous enhancements in both the star formation and SMBH
accretion rates depends on both the mass ratio of the merger and on the gas
mass of the post-merger galaxy. Despite these accretion rate enhancements, only
~35% of post-mergers experience a luminous AGN ($L_{bol}>10^{44}$ erg/s) within

industry, opening new prospects as a novel computerized methodology to make

teleoperations, VR allows users to use their physical movements to drive
robotic systems in the virtual environment. The latest VR devices are also
equipped with integrated eye-tracking, which constitutes an exceptional
opportunity for monitoring users' workload online. However, such devices are
fairly recent, and human factors have been consistently marginalized so far in
telerobotics research. We thus covered these aspects by analyzing extensive
behavioral data generated by 24 participants driving a simulated industrial
robot in VR through a pick-and-place task. Users drove the robot via
button-based and action-based controls and under low (single-task) and high
(dual-task) mental demands. We collected self-reports, performance and
eye-tracking data. Specifically, we asked i) how the interactive features of VR
affect users' performance and workload, and additionally tested ii) the
sensibility of diverse eye parameters in monitoring users' vigilance and
workload throughout the task. Users performed faster and more accurately, while
also showing a lower mental workload, when using an action-based VR control.
Among the eye parameters, pupil size was the most resilient indicator of
workload, as it was highly correlated with the self-reports and was not
affected by the user's degree of physical motion in VR. Our results thus bring
a fresh human-centric overview of human-robot interactions in VR, and
systematically demonstrate the potential of VR devices for monitoring human

a given continuous positive ambient function $g$, and where $\nu$ denotes the
inner normal. It is well-known that taking limits in the sense of varifolds
within this class is not possible in general, due to the appearence of ""hidden
boundaries"", that is, portions (of positive measure with even multiplicity) on
which the (weakly defined) mean curvature vanishes, so that $g$ does not
prescribe the mean curvature in the limit. As a special instance of a more
general result, we prove that locally uniform $L^q$-bounds on the (weakly
defined) second fundamental form, for $q>1$, in addition to the customary
locally uniform bounds on the perimeters, lead to a compact class of boundaries
with mean curvature prescribed by $g$.
  The proof relies on treating the boundaries as 'oriented integral varifolds',
in order to exploit their orientability feature (that is lost when treating
them as (unoriented) varifolds). Specifically, it relies on the formulation and
analysis of a weak notion of curvature coefficients for oriented integral
varifolds (inspired by Hutchinson's work).
  This framework gives (with no additional effort) a compactness result for
oriented integral varifolds with curvature locally bounded in $L^q$ with $q>1$

vary with the varifold for which it prescribes the mean curvature, as long as
there is locally uniform convergence of the prescribing functions). Our notions

on a nonlinear function as the state. This nonstandard state is often called a
Koopman observable and is usually approximated numerically by a superposition
of functions drawn from a dictionary. In a widely used algorithm, Extended
Dynamic Mode Decomposition, the dictionary functions are drawn from a fixed
class of functions. Recently, deep learning combined with EDMD has been used to
learn novel dictionary functions in an algorithm called deep dynamic mode
decomposition (deepDMD). The learned representation both (1) accurately models
and (2) scales well with the dimension of the original nonlinear system. In
this paper we analyze the learned dictionaries from deepDMD and explore the
theoretical basis for their strong performance. We explore State-Inclusive
Logistic Lifting (SILL) dictionary functions to approximate Koopman
observables. Error analysis of these dictionary functions show they satisfy a
property of subspace approximation, which we define as uniform finite
approximate closure. Our results provide a hypothesis to explain the success of
deep neural networks in learning numerical approximations to Koopman operators.
Part 2 of this paper will extend this explanation by demonstrating the subspace
invariant of heterogeneous dictionaries and presenting a head-to-head numerical
comparison of deepDMD and low-parameter heterogeneous dictionary learning.

the accordion-like system leads to the formation of hexagonal honeycombs that

evolving neighbourhood to efficiently navigate through it. However, agent-level
intelligence does not guarantee that at the level of a collective; a common
example is the jamming we observe in traffic flows. In this study, we ask: how
and when do the interactions between intelligent agents translate to desirable
or intelligent collective outcomes? We explore this question in the context of
a bidisperse crowd of agents with opposing desired directions of movement, like
in a pedestrian crossing. We model a facet of intelligence, viz. memory, where
the agents remember how well they were able to travel in their desired
directions and make up for their non-optimal past. We find that memory has a
non-monotonic effect on the dynamics of the collective. When memory is short
term, the local rearrangement of the agents lead to the formation of
symmetrically jammed arrangements, which take longer to unjam. However, when
agents remember across longer time-scales, we find that the dynamics of an
agent becomes sensitive to the relatively small differences in the history of
the nearby agents. This gives rise to heterogeneity in the movement that causes
agents to unjam more readily and form lanes that ease the movement.

compression performance. This contrasts from recent advances in image
generation and representation learning, where Vector Quantization is more
commonly employed. In this work, we attempt to bring these lines of research
closer by revisiting vector quantization for image compression. We build upon
the VQ-VAE framework and introduce several modifications. First, we replace the
vanilla vector quantizer by a product quantizer. This intermediate solution
between vector and scalar quantization allows for a much wider set of
rate-distortion points: It implicitly defines high-quality quantizers that
would otherwise require intractably large codebooks. Second, inspired by the
success of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in the context of self-supervised
learning and generative image models, we propose a novel conditional entropy
model which improves entropy coding by modelling the co-dependencies of the
quantized latent codes. The resulting PQ-MIM model is surprisingly effective:
its compression performance on par with recent hyperprior methods. It also
outperforms HiFiC in terms of FID and KID metrics when optimized with
perceptual losses (e.g. adversarial). Finally, since PQ-MIM is compatible with
image generation frameworks, we show qualitatively that it can operate under a
hybrid mode between compression and generation, with no further training or
finetuning. As a result, we explore the extreme compression regime where an

modern cloud infrastructures that support today's Internet. However, Web3 is
still limited, supporting only applications in the domains of content creation
and sharing, decentralized financing, and decentralized communication. This is
mainly due to the technologies supporting Web3: blockchain, IPFS, and libp2p,
that although provide a good collection of tools to develop Web3 applications,
are still limited in terms of design and performance. This motivates the need
to better understand these technologies as to enable novel optimizations that
can push Web3 to its full potential. Unfortunately, understanding the current
behavior of a fully decentralized large-scale distributed system is a difficult
task, as there is no centralized authority that has full knowledge of the
system operation.
  To this end, in this paper we characterize the workload of IPFS, a key
enabler of Web3. To achieve this, we have collected traces from accesses
performed by users to one of the most popular IPFS gateways located in North
America for a period of two weeks. Through the fine analysis of these traces,
we gathered the amount of requests to the system, and found the providers of
the requested content. With this data, we characterize both the popularity of
requested and provided content, as well as their geo-location (by matching IP
address with the MaxMind database). Our results show that most of the requests
in IPFS are only to a few different content, that is provided by large portion
of peers in the system. Furthermore, our analysis also shows that most requests
are provided by the two largest portions of providers in the system, located in
North America and Europe. With these insights, we conclude that the current
IPFS architecture is sub-optimal and propose a research agenda for the future.

deviations from primordial Gaussianity. As a result, much effort has been put
into improving measurement techniques as well as theoretical modelling,
especially in Fourier space. Comparatively, little progress has been made,
instead, in configuration space analyses. This work represents a first step
towards filling this gap by proposing a new strategy for modelling 3-point
statistics at higher perturbative orders in configuration space. Starting from
the next-to-leading order model for the matter bispectrum, we use 2D- FFTLog to
generate its counterpart in configuration space. We calibrate the procedure
using the leading order predictions for which an analytic model for the
three-point correlation function (3PCF) already exists. Then we assess the
goodness of the 3PCF model by comparing its predictions with measurements
performed on the matter distribution in collisionless cosmological N-body
experiments. We focus on two redshifts (z = 0.49 and z = 1.05) in the range
spanned by current and future galaxy redshift surveys. The chi-square analysis
reveals that the next-to-leading order 3PCF models significantly improve over
the leading order one for all triangle configurations in both redshifts,
increasing the number of matched configurations at redshift z = 1.05 and z =
0.49, respectively. In particular, a significant improvement is also seen on
the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale for triangle configurations

cost of the model proposed here is high but not prohibitively - five hours for
48 cores - large and represents the first step towards a complete 3PC model for

streaming data settings: valid inference after data peeking requires correcting
for multiple testing but such corrections generally result in low power.

temporal evolution, using the rich set of available archival data from
XMM-Newton, Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift/XRT. We tracked the evolution of the
source on the hardness-intensity diagram and find that the source oscillates
between two main states: one characterised by a hard and luminous spectrum and
the other at low hardness and luminosity. The properties of the soft component
remain constant between the two states, suggesting that changes in the
mass-transfer rate are not driving the spectral transitions. Instead, the
bi-modal behaviour of the source and the known super-orbital period would point
to the precession of the accretion disc. Here, we tested two theoretical
models: (1) Lense-Thirring precession, which can explain the super-orbital
period if the NS has a magnetic field $B$ $\lesssim10^{10}$ G, supporting the
idea of M81 X-6 as a weakly magnetised NS, and (2) precession due to the torque
of the NS magnetic field, which leads to $B \gtrsim$ 10$^{11}$ G. However, the
latter scenario, assuming M81 X-6 shares similar properties with other NS-ULXs,
is disfavoured because it would require magnetic field strengths ($B>10^{15}$
G) much higher than those known for other pulsating ULXs. We further show that
the contribution from the hard component attributed to the putative accretion
column sits just below the typical values found in pulsating ULXs, which,
together with the low value of the pulsed fraction ($\leq10$\%) found for one
XMM-Newton/pn observation, could explain the source's lack of pulsations. The
spectral properties and variability of M81 X-6 can be accounted for if the
accretor is a NS with a low magnetic field. Under the hypothesis of
Lense-Thirring precession, we predict a spin period of the NS of a few seconds.

predicting agents future behaviors and planning accordingly. Leveraging this

latent strategies: individual $z_A$, and relational $z_R$ using a modified
Graph Attention Network module to extract interaction features. We encourage
each agent to behave according to the strategy by conditioning its local $Q$
functions on $z_A$, and we further equip agents with a shared $Q$ function that
conditions on $z_R$. Additionally, we introduce two regularizers to allow
predicted trajectories to be accurate and rewarding. Empirical results on
Google Research Football (GRF) and StarCraft (SC) II micromanagement tasks show
that our method establishes a new state of the art being, to the best of our

to predict the electric field within wide-bandgap semiconductors. The issue is
the daunting number of bulk charge-trap candidates which means the treatment of
bulk charge traps is generally qualitative or uses generalized models that do
not consider the trap's particular electronic structure. The electric field

determining the operation of semiconductor devices and the performance of
solid-state single-photon emitters embedded within the semiconductor devices.
In this work we accurately compute the average electric field measured at the
location of N$V^-$ charged defects for the substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$)
concentration of $n_{\text{N}_\text{C}} \approx 1.41\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$

band bending. Our work has the potential to aid both in the prediction of the

measured cluster tSZ signal can be, however, contaminated by Cosmic Infrared
Background (CIB) emission, as the CIB is spatially correlated with the cluster
tSZ field. We quantify the extent of this contamination by applying the
iterative multi-frequency matched filter (iMMF) cluster-finding method to mock
Planck-like data from the Websky simulation. We find a significant bias in the
retrieved cluster tSZ observables (signal-to-noise and Compton-$y$ amplitude),
at the level of about $0.5\, \sigma$ per cluster. This CIB-induced bias
translates into about $20$% fewer detections than expected if all the Planck
HFI channels are used in the analysis, which can potentially bias derived
cosmological constraints. We introduce a spectrally constrained iMMF, or
sciMMF, which proves to be highly effective at suppressing this CIB-induced
bias from the tSZ cluster observables by spectrally deprojecting the
cluster-correlated CIB at the expense of a small signal-to-noise penalty. Our
sciMMF is also robust to modelling uncertainties, namely to the choice of
deprojection spectral energy distribution. With it, CIB-free cluster catalogues

tasks simultaneously with a single shared network where each task has a
distinct personalized header network for fine-tuning. MTL can be integrated
into a federated learning (FL) setting if tasks are distributed across clients
and clients have a single shared network, leading to personalized federated
learning (PFL). To cope with statistical heterogeneity in the federated setting
across clients which can significantly degrade the learning performance, we use
a distributed dynamic weighting approach. To perform the communication between
the remote parameter server (PS) and the clients efficiently over the noisy
channel in a power and bandwidth-limited regime, we utilize over-the-air (OTA)
aggregation and hierarchical federated learning (HFL). Thus, we propose
hierarchical over-the-air (HOTA) PFL with a dynamic weighting strategy which we
call HOTA-FedGradNorm. Our algorithm considers the channel conditions during
the dynamic weight selection process. We conduct experiments on a wireless
communication system dataset (RadComDynamic). The experimental results
demonstrate that the training speed with HOTA-FedGradNorm is faster compared to
the algorithms with a naive static equal weighting strategy. In addition,
HOTA-FedGradNorm provides robustness against the negative channel effects by
compensating for the channel conditions during the dynamic weight selection

21-cm and foreground modes by simultaneously fitting the spectra from multiple
different antennas, which can be used in combination with the method of
utilizing the time dependence of foregrounds while fitting multiple drift scan
spectra. To demonstrate this idea, we consider two different foreground models
(i) a simple foreground model, where we assume a constant spectral index over
the sky, and (ii) a more realistic foreground model, with a spatial variation
of the spectral index. For the simple foreground model, with just a single
antenna design, we are able to extract the signal with good accuracy if we
simultaneously fit the data from multiple time slices. The 21-cm signal
extraction is further improved when we simultaneously fit the data from
different antennas as well. This improvement becomes more pronounced while
using the more realistic mock observations generated from the detailed
foreground model. We find that even if we fit multiple time slices, the
recovered signal is biased and inaccurate for a single antenna. However,
simultaneously fitting the data from different antennas reduces the bias and
the uncertainty by a factor of 2-3 on the extracted 21-cm signal.

of binary-disc systems have adopted locally isothermal equation of state. In
this study, we use the grid-based code $\texttt{Athena++}$ to conduct a suite
of two-dimensional viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary accretion
on a cartesian grid, resolving the central cavity of the binary. The gas
thermodynamics is treated by thermal relaxation towards an equilibrium
temperature (based on the constant$-\beta$ cooling ansatz, where $\beta$ is the
cooling time in units of the local Keplerian time). Focusing on equal mass,
circular binaries in CBDs with (equilibrium) disc aspect ratio $H/R=0.1$, we
find that the cooling of the disc gas significantly influences the binary
orbital evolution, accretion variability, and CBD morphology, and the effect
depends sensitively on the disc viscosity prescriptions. When adopting a
constant kinematic viscosity, a finite cooling time ($\beta \gtrsim 0.1$) leads
to binary inspiral as opposed to outspiral and the CBD cavity becomes more
symmetric. When adopting a dynamically varying $\alpha-$viscosity, binary
inspiral only occurs within a narrow range of cooling time (corresponding to
$\beta$ around 0.5).

fitting the linear power spectrum with cosmology-independent functions that
resemble integer powers of quantum field theory massive propagators with
complex masses. A remarkable small number of them is sufficient to reach enough
accuracy. Similarly to former approaches, the cosmology dependence is encoded
in the coordinate vector of the expansion of the linear power spectrum in our

loop integral evaluated on a given combination of basis vectors. For each
cosmology, the evaluation of a loop integral amounts to contracting this tensor
with the coordinate vector of the linear power spectrum. The 3-dimensional loop
integrals for our basis functions can be evaluated using techniques familiar to
particle physics, such as recursion relations and Feynman parametrization. We
apply our formalism to evaluate the one-loop bispectrum of galaxies in redshift
space. The final analytical expressions are quite simple and can be evaluated
with little computational and memory cost. We show that the same expressions
resolve the integration of all one-loop $N$-point function in the EFTofLSS.

recover free-form geometry, but produce disembodied limbs or degenerate shapes
for novel poses or clothes. To increase robustness for these cases, existing
work uses an explicit parametric body model to constrain surface
reconstruction, but this limits the recovery of free-form surfaces such as
loose clothing that deviates from the body. What we want is a method that
combines the best properties of implicit representation and explicit body
regularization. To this end, we make two key observations: (1) current networks
are better at inferring detailed 2D maps than full-3D surfaces, and (2) a
parametric model can be seen as a ""canvas"" for stitching together detailed
surface patches. Based on these, our method, ECON, has three main steps: (1) It
infers detailed 2D normal maps for the front and back side of a clothed person.
(2) From these, it recovers 2.5D front and back surfaces, called d-BiNI, that
are equally detailed, yet incomplete, and registers these w.r.t. each other
with the help of a SMPL-X body mesh recovered from the image. (3) It ""inpaints""
the missing geometry between d-BiNI surfaces. If the face and hands are noisy,
they can optionally be replaced with the ones of SMPL-X. As a result, ECON
infers high-fidelity 3D humans even in loose clothes and challenging poses.
This goes beyond previous methods, according to the quantitative evaluation on
the CAPE and Renderpeople datasets. Perceptual studies also show that ECON's
perceived realism is better by a large margin. Code and models are available

number of dwarf galaxies discovered in SDSS and GAMA. As a spare fiber survey,
LOW-Z currently receives fiber allocation for just ~30% of its targets.

selection at z < 0.03 between 19 <r < 21. The full five-year DESI program will
expand the LOW-Z sample, densely mapping the low-redshift Universe and
providing critical information about how to pursue effective and efficient

include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as
self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of
globular clusters depends on their orbital pericenter and total energy, and
that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest
that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by
the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass
growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with
numerous orbits. This calibration starts from the bulge, to Kraken, Gaia
Sausage Enceladus, Sagittarius stellar systems, and finally to the new coming
dwarfs, either or not linked to the vast-polar structure. The most eccentric
globular clusters and dwarfs have their half-light radius scaling as the
inverse of their binding energy, and this over more than two decades. This
means that earlier arriving satellites are smaller due to the tidal effects of
the MW. Therefore, most halo inhabitants appear to have their structural
parameters shaped by MW tides and also by ram-pressure for the most recent
arrivals, the dwarf galaxies. The correlations found in this study can be used
as tools to further investigate the origin of globular clusters and dwarfs, as
well as the assembly history of our Galaxy.

geometric locality, we prove bounds on $|S'_{\alpha}(t)|$ that depend on the
decay rate of interactions with distance. When $\alpha = 1$, the bound is
$|A|$-independent for all power-law decaying interactions $V(r) \sim r^{-w}$

the interactions are finite-range or decay faster than $V(r) \sim e^{- c\,

similar arguments, we also prove bounds on $k$-local systems with or without
geometric locality. A central theme of this work is that the value of $\alpha$
strongly influences the interplay between locality and entanglement growth. In
other words, the Von Neumann entropy and the $\alpha$-Renyi entropies cannot be
regarded as proxies for each other in studies of entanglement dynamics. We
compare these bounds with analytic and numerical results on Hamiltonians with

the models starts soon after initialisation and continues as the models evolve.
The initialized galaxies indeed evolve to a state which is on the observed main
sequence, and reasonably matches the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The available
formulation of sub-grid physics is therefore adequate and leads to galaxies
that largely behave like observed galaxies, grow in radius, and have flat
rotation curves $-$ provided we use Milgromian gravitation. Furthermore, the
strength of the bars tends to be inversely correlated with the stellar mass of
the galaxy, whereas the bar length strongly correlates with the stellar mass.
Irrespective of the mass, the bar pattern speed stays constant with time,
indicating that dynamical friction does not affect the bar dynamics. The models
demonstrate Renzo's rule and form structures at large radii, much as in real

limited by the emission of gravitational waves, due to the presence of
large-scale asymmetries in the internal temperature profile of the star. These
temperature asymmetries have been demonstrated to lead to a non-axisymmetric
mass-distribution, or `mountain', that generates gravitational waves at twice
the spin frequency. The presence of a toroidal magnetic field in the interior
of accreting neutron stars has been shown to introduce such anisotropies in the
star's thermal conductivity, by restricting the flow of heat orthogonal to the
magnetic field and establishing a non-axisymmetric temperature distribution
within the star. We revisit this mechanism, extending the computational domain
from (only) the crust to the entire star, incorporating more realistic
microphysics, and exploring different choices of outer boundary condition. By
allowing a magnetic field to permeate the core of the neutron star, we find
that the likely level of temperature asymmetry in the inner crust ($\rho \sim
10^{13}$ g cm$^{-3}$) can be up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the
previous estimate, improving prospects for one day detecting continuous
gravitational radiation. We also show that temperature asymmetries sufficiently

of gravity and matter is enhanced to quantum scale symmetry, i.e., scale
symmetry in the presence of quantum fluctuations, at very high energies. To
achieve such a symmetry enhancement, the effect of quantum fluctuations must
balance out. It is to be expected that such a balance can only be achieved
within a set of theories with limited field content and interaction structure.
In this chapter, we review how much is known about these limits. From the
quantum scale invariant regime, the theory transits to a theory with distinct
physical scales - most importantly masses for various elementary particles - at
low energies. There, quantum scale invariance can leave its imprint in
relations between various interactions and mass scales of the theory. These
relations can be compared to experimental data, which has two possible
implications: first, if the relations do not match the data, the underlying
quantum theory of gravity and matter, formulated at and beyond the Planck
scale, has been ruled out using experimental data from energies much below the
Planck scale. Second, if the relations match the data, the asymptotic-safety
paradigm provides a first-principles derivation of free parameters of the
Standard Model. Most importantly, this may include the ratios of the Higgs mass
to the electroweak scale as well as the value of the finestructure constant.
Similarly, theories beyond the Standard Model may come with fewer free
parameters than in their effective-field-theory incarnation without gravity.

the early universe, the Goldstone bosons can be thermally produced from their
interactions with the heavy colored fermions and contribute to $\Delta N_{\rm

repulsive (I = 2) isospin channel contributions to the scalar $\pi-\pi$
interaction in the low-energy region that is known for the vacuum phase shifts,
takes place also at finite temperature. This happens despite the strong medium
dependence of these phase shifts that enters our model by the temperature
dependence of the $\sigma$- meson and constituent quark masses because for
these masses the relation $m_\sigma(T) \approx 2 m_q (T)$ holds and the
scattering length approximation is valid as long as the strong decay channel
$\sigma \to \pi \pi$ is open. Exploiting the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for
describing the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum and its
restoration at finite temperature, we justify with our approach that the
$\sigma$-meson should be absent from the hadron resonance gas description at
low temperatures because the above cancellation holds. However, since this
cancellation breaks down in the vicinity of the hadronization transition, where
due to chiral symmetry restoration the decay channel $\sigma \to \pi \pi$
closes and the $\sigma$- meson becomes a good resonance, the latter should be
included into the statistical model description of chemical freeze-out in

instability (SASI), play an essential role in the dynamics of core-collapse
supernovae, with observable imprints in the neutrino and gravitational wave
signals. Yet, the impact of stellar rotation on the development of SASI is
poorly explored. We investigate the conditions favoring the growth of SASI in
the presence of rotation through a perturbative analysis. The properties of
SASI are compared in two stationary configurations, cylindrical and spherical
equatorial, which mainly differ by their advection timescales from the shock to
the proto-neutron star surface. Without rotation, the mode $m=1$, corresponding
to a one-armed spiral SASI deformation, can be significantly more unstable in
the spherical equatorial configuration. In fact, the shorter advection time in
the spherical equatorial geometry allows for a larger contribution of the
entropic-acoustic coupling from the region of adiabatic compression near the
surface of the proto-neutron star. The angular momentum of the collapsing core
favors the growth of prograde spiral modes $m=1$ and $m = 2$ in both
geometries. Although the growth rate of the spiral instability is
systematically faster in spherical geometry, its oscillation frequency is
remarkably insensitive to the geometry. Such a contrast with non-rotating flows
calls for a deeper understanding of the role of advection in the mechanism of
spiral SASI. Our findings suggest that the resonant coupling of acoustic waves
with their corotation radius may play a major role in the instability mechanism
of collapsing cores with rotation. Elucidating this physical mechanism is
essential to interpret the signal from future multi-messenger supernova
observations.

and fluctuations appear on macroscopic scales. Highly dynamic and
macroscopically broad interfacial regions, each composed of many domain walls,
appear between macroscopically ordered regions and consequently the scaled
correlation function violates the Porod law. We focus on two essential
quantities which together quantify the unique characteristics of FDPO, namely
the total number of domain walls and the length of the largest ordered domain.
We present results in the context of coarse-grained depth (CD) models, both in
steady state and while coarsening. Analytic arguments supported by numerical
simulations show that even though domain wall number fluctuations are very
strong, the associated variance remains constant in time during coarsening.
Further, the length of the largest cluster grows as a power law with
multiplicative logarithms which involve both the time and system size. In
addition, we identify corrections to the leading power law scaling in several
quantities in the coarsening regime. We also study a generalisation of the CD
model in which the domain wall density is controlled by a fugacity and show
that it maps on to the truncated inverse distance squared Ising (TIDSI) model.
The generalised model shows a mixed order phase transition, with the regular CD
model (which exhibits FDPO) corresponding to the critical point.

should enable developers to define a complete set of CRUD methods for the
processed data. The research team compared the most commonly used data transfer
protocols and concepts in this paper: REST, WebSocket, gRPC GraphQL and SOAP.
To do that, a set of web servers was implemented in Python, each using one of
the examined technologies. Then, the team performed an automated benchmark
measuring time and data transfer overhead for a set of defined operations:
creating an entity, retrieving a list of 100 entities and fetching details of
one entity. Tests were designed to avoid the results being interfered by
database connection or docker-compose environment characteristics. The research
team has concluded that gRPC was the most efficient and reliable data transfer
method. On the other hand, GraphQL turned out to be the slowest communication
method of all. Moreover, its server and client libraries caused the most
problems with proper usage in a web server. SOAP did not participate in
benchmarking due to limited compatibility with Python and a lack of popularity
in modern web solutions.

the error syndrome, a series of two-qubit gates are used to build parity-check

results significantly advance the analysis, enabling one to practically
determine all the moments from the explicit knowledge of the lowest one. As
applications, first we study the moments of the quasimomentum distribution in
the Lieb-Liniger model and find explicit analytical results. The latter moments
determine several basic quantities, e.g., the $N$-body local correlation
functions. We prove the equivalence between different expressions found in the

result for the four-body local correlation function in terms of the moments of
the quasimomentum distributions. We eventually find the analytical results for
the three- and four-body correlation functions in the form of asymptotic series

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication produces a serious array
gain loss. True-time delay (TTD)-based hybrid precoding has been considered to
compensate for the beam squint effect. By fixing the phase shifter (PS)
precoder, a common strategy has been designing TTD precoder under the
assumption of unbounded time delay values. In this paper, we present a new
approach to the problem of beam squint compensation, based on the joint
optimization of the TTD and PS precoders under per TTD device time delay
constraints. We first derive a lower bound of the achievable rate and show that
in the large system limit the ideal analog precoder that completely compensates
for the beam squint is equivalent to the one that maximizes the achievable rate
lower bound. Unlike the prior approaches, our approach does not require the
unbounded time delay assumption; the range of time delay values that a TTD can
produce is strictly limited in our approach. Instead of focusing on the design
of TTD values only, we jointly optimize both the TTD and PS values to
effectively cope with the practical time delay constraints. Taking the
advantage of the proposed joint TTD and PS precoder optimization approach, we
quantify the minimum number of TTDs required to produce a predefined array gain
performance. The simulation results illustrate the substantially improved
performance with the array gain performance guarantee of the proposed joint
optimization method.

silicon abundance has undergone a downward revision in recent years. We
additionally show the effects of the chosen line sample, broadening due to
velocity fields, collisional broadening, model spatial resolution, and magnetic
fields. CO5BOLD model atmospheres for the Sun were used in conjunction with the
LINFOR3D spectral synthesis code to generate model spectra, which were then fit
to observations in the Hamburg solar atlas. We present a sample of 11 carefully
selected lines (from an initial choice of 39 lines) in the optical and
infrared, made possible with newly determined oscillator strengths for the
majority of these lines. Our final sample includes seven optical Si I lines,
three infrared Si I lines, and one optical Si II line. We derived a
photospheric solar silicon abundance of $\log \epsilon_\mathrm{Si} = 7.57 \pm
0.04$, including a $-0.01$ dex correction from Non-Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium (NLTE) effects. Combining this with meteoritic abundances and
previously determined photospheric abundances results in a metal mass fraction
Z/X = $0.0220 \pm 0.0020$. We found a tendency of obtaining overly broad
synthetic lines. We mitigated the impact of this by devising a de-broadening
procedure. The over-broadening of synthetic lines does not substantially affect

poor OPE estimates under policy distribution shift i.e., when the probability
of a particular state-action pair occurring under $\pi_e$ is very different
from the probability of that same pair occurring in $\mathcal{D}$ (Voloshin et
al. 2021, Fu et al. 2021). In this work, we propose to improve the accuracy of
OPE estimators by projecting the high-dimensional state-space into a
low-dimensional state-space using concepts from the state abstraction
literature. Specifically, we consider marginalized importance sampling (MIS)
OPE algorithms which compute state-action distribution correction ratios to
produce their OPE estimate. In the original ground state-space, these ratios
may have high variance which may lead to high variance OPE. However, we prove
that in the lower-dimensional abstract state-space the ratios can have lower
variance resulting in lower variance OPE. We then highlight the challenges that
arise when estimating the abstract ratios from data, identify sufficient
conditions to overcome these issues, and present a minimax optimization problem
whose solution yields these abstract ratios. Finally, our empirical evaluation
on difficult, high-dimensional state-space OPE tasks shows that the abstract
ratios can make MIS OPE estimators achieve lower mean-squared error and more
robust to hyperparameter tuning than the ground ratios.

dominates the evolution of field-line topology in three-dimensional systems.
Chaos has no direct role in the dissipation of energy. A large current density,

comparable time scale to the topological evolution. Nevertheless, chaos plus
Alfv\'en wave damping explain why both timescales tend to be approximately an
order of magnitude longer than the evolution timescale $a/v$. Magnetic helicity
is injected onto tubes of field lines when boundary flows have vorticity. Chaos
can spread but not destroy magnetic helicity. Resistivity has a negligible

extraction (BE, also known as skull-stripping) and manual correction by an

time-consuming and, therefore, not always feasible, resulting in
skull-stripping faults that can negatively impact the tumor segmentation

the stellar core terminates the lives of stars more massive than about 9 Msun.
This can trigger the powerful ejection of a large fraction of the star's
material in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), whose extreme luminosity is
energized by the decay of radioactive isotopes such as 56Ni and 56Co. When
evolving in close binary systems, the compact relics of such infernal
catastrophes spiral towards each other on orbits gradually decaying by
gravitational-wave emission. Ultimately, the violent collision of the two
components forms a more massive, rapidly spinning remnant, again accompanied by
the ejection of considerable amounts of matter. These merger events can be
observed by high-energy bursts of gamma rays with afterglows and
electromagnetic transients called kilonovae, which radiate the energy released
in radioactive decays of freshly assembled rapid neutron-capture elements. By
means of their mass ejection and the nuclear and neutrino reactions taking
place in the ejecta, both CCSNe and compact object mergers (COMs) are prominent
sites of heavy-element nucleosynthesis and play a central role in the cosmic
cycle of matter and the chemical enrichment history of galaxies. The nuclear
equation of state (EoS) of NS matter, from neutron-rich to proton-dominated
conditions and with temperatures ranging from about zero to ~100 MeV, is a
crucial ingredient in these astrophysical phenomena. It determines their
dynamical processes, their remnant properties even at the level of deciding
between NS or BH, and the properties of the associated emission of neutrinos,
whose interactions govern the thermodynamic conditions and the
neutron-to-proton ratio for nucleosynthesis reactions in the innermost ejecta.

Hamiltonians that have emergent low-energy descriptions with Lorentz
invariance. The critical transverse field Ising model with nearest neighbor
interactions, for instance, maps to free fermions with a relativistic low
energy dispersion. However, spin models realized in artificial quantum
simulators based on neutral Rydberg atoms, or trapped ions, generically exhibit
long range power-law decay of interactions with $J(r) \sim 1/r^\alpha$ for a
wide range of $\alpha$. In this work, we study the fate of spatiotemporal
quenches in these models with a fixed velocity $v$ for the propagation of the
quench front, using the numerical time-dependent variational principle. For
$\alpha \gtrsim 3$, where the critical theory is suggested to have a dynamical
critical exponent $z = 1$, our simulations show that optimal cooling is
achieved when the front velocity $v$ approaches $c$, the effective speed of
excitations in the critical model. The energy density is inhomogeneously
distributed in space, with prominent hot regions populated by excitations
co-propagating with the quench front, and cold regions populated by
counter-propagating excitations. Lowering $\alpha$ largely blurs the boundaries
between these regions. For $\alpha < 3$, we find that the Doppler cooling
effect disappears, as expected from renormalization group results for the
critical model which suggest a dispersion $\omega \sim q^z$ with $z < 1$.
Instead, we show that excitations are controlled by two relevant length scales
whose ratio is related to that of the front velocity to a threshold velocity
that ultimately determines the adiabaticity of the quench.

magnetic fluctuations yet does not develop long-range magnetic order. By
calculating the static spin susceptibility $\chi(\mathbf{q})$ within a
realistic sixteen orbital Hubbard-Hund model, we determine the leading
instability to be ferromagnetic (FM). We then explore the effect of doping and
calculate the critical Hubbard interaction strength $U_c$ that is required for
the development of magnetic order. We find that $U_c$ decreases under electron
doping and with increasing Hund's coupling $J$, but increases rapidly under
hole doping. This suggests that magnetic order could possibly emerge under
electron doping but not under hole doping, which agrees with experimental
findings. We map out the leading magnetic instability as a function of doping
and Hund's coupling and find several antiferromagnetic phases in addition to
FM. We also quantify the degree of itinerant frustration in the model and
resolve the contributions of different orbitals to the magnetic susceptibility.
Finally, we discuss the dynamic spin susceptibility, $\chi(\mathbf{q},
\omega)$, at finite frequencies, where we recover the anisotropy of the peaks
at $\mathbf{Q}_\pi = (\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \pi)$ observed by inelastic neutron
scattering that is associated with the phenomenon of itinerant magnetic
frustration. By comparing results between theory and experiment, we conclude
that the essential experimental features of doped SrCo$_2$As$_2$ are well

similar to DMFT. With a few bath sites, we observe that g-RISB is
systematically more accurate than DMFT for the ground-state observables. On the
other hand, the relative accuracy of these methods is generally comparable for
the quasiparticle weight and the spectral function. As expected, we observe
that g-RISB satisfies the variational principle in infinite dimensions, as the
total energy decreases monotonically towards the exact value as a function of
the number of bath sites, suggesting that the g-RISB wavefunction may approach
the exact ground state in infinite dimensions. Our results suggest that the
g-RISB is a promising method for first principle simulations of strongly
correlated matter, which can capture the behavior of both static and dynamical
observables, at a relatively low computational cost.

  of the Local Group","12 pages, 10 figures, + appendix",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Low-mass galaxies are highly susceptible to environmental effects that can
efficiently quench star formation. We explore the role of ram pressure in
quenching low-mass galaxies ($M_{*}\sim10^{5-9}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$) within 2 Mpc
of Milky Way (MW) hosts using the FIRE-2 simulations. Ram pressure is highly
variable across different environments, within individual MW haloes, and for
individual low-mass galaxies over time. The impulsiveness of ram pressure --
the maximum ram pressure scaled to the integrated ram pressure prior to
quenching -- correlates with whether a galaxy is quiescent or star-forming. The
time-scale between maximum ram pressure and quenching is anticorrelated with
impulsiveness, such that high impulsiveness corresponds to quenching
time-scales $<1$ Gyr. Galaxies in low-mass groups
($M_\mathrm{*,host}\sim10^{7-9}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$) outside of MW haloes
experience typical ram pressure only slightly lower than ram pressure on MW
satellites, helping to explain effective quenching via group pre-processing.
Ram pressure on MW satellites rises sharply with decreasing distance to the
host, and, at a fixed physical distance, more recent pericentre passages are
typically associated with higher ram pressure because of greater gas density in
the inner host halo at late times. Furthermore, the inner gas density of Local
Group-like paired host haloes is larger at small angles ($\lesssim30^\circ$)
off the host galaxy disc, compared to isolated hosts. The ram pressure and
quiescent fraction of satellites within these low latitude regions are
correspondingly elevated, signaling anisotropic quenching via ram pressure
around paired hosts.

galaxies observed by the HST Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey (LEGUS),
and examine relationships between the ensemble properties of the cluster
populations and those of their host galaxies: star formation rate (SFR) density
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). A strength of this analysis is the availability of SFRs
measured from temporally resolved star formation histories which provide the
means to match cluster and host-galaxy properties on several timescales (1-10,
1-100, and 10-100~Myr). Nevertheless, studies of this kind are challenging for
dwarf galaxies due to the small numbers of clusters in each system. We mitigate
these issues by combining the clusters across different galaxies with similar
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ properties. We find good agreement with a well-established
relationship ($M_{V}^{brightest}$-SFR), but find no significant correlations
between $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and the slopes of the cluster luminosity function,
mass function, nor the age distribution. We also find no significant trend
between the the fraction of stars in bound clusters at different age ranges

1-10 to 10-100~Myr) suggesting early cluster dissolution, though the presence
of unbound clusters in the youngest time bin makes it difficult to quantify the
degree of dissolution. While our data do not exhibit strong correlations
between $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and ensemble cluster properties, we cannot rule out
that a weak trend might exist given the relatively large uncertainties due to
low number statistics and the limited $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ range probed.

group orbits into the \texttt{UniformMesh} algorithm
(\cite{Kleinberg2005_UniformMesh}), which uniformly discretizes the set of
arms. Using the side-observation approach, we prove an improved regret upper
bound, which depends on the cardinality of the group, given that the group is

also get embodied in cotton fibers reducing its quality and marketable value.
Therefore, it is required to detect, locate, and remove the bags before cotton
is harvested. Manually detecting and locating these bags in cotton fields is
labor intensive, time-consuming and a costly process. To solve these
challenges, we present application of four variants of YOLOv5 (YOLOv5s,
YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l and YOLOv5x) for detecting plastic shopping bags using
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)-acquired RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) images. We

accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the effect of height of plastic bags
on the detection accuracy. It was found that color of bags had significant
effect (p < 0.001) on accuracy across all the four variants while it did not
show any significant effect on the AP with YOLOv5m (p = 0.10) and YOLOv5x (p =
0.35) at 95% confidence level. Similarly, YOLOv5-variant did not show any
significant effect on the AP (p = 0.11) and accuracy (p = 0.73) of white bags,
but it had significant effects on the AP (p = 0.03) and accuracy (p = 0.02) of
brown bags including on the mAP@50 (p = 0.01) and inference speed (p < 0.0001).
Additionally, height of plastic bags had significant effect (p < 0.0001) on
overall detection accuracy. The findings reported in this paper can be useful

adiabatic compression of wave dark matter - a light bosonic dark matter
candidate with its mass smaller than a few eV. Using the adiabatic theorem, we
show that the adiabatic compression leads to a much denser wave dark matter
halo similar to the particle dark matter halo in the semiclassical limit. The
compressed wave halo differs from that of the particle halo near the center
where the semiclassical approximation breaks down, and the central profile
depends on dark matter and the central black hole mass as they determine
whether the soliton and low angular momentum modes can survive over the
astrophysical time scale without being absorbed by the black hole. Such a
compressed profile has several astrophysical implications. As one example, we
study the gravitational waves from the inspiral between a central
intermediate-mass black hole and a compact solar-mass object within the wave
dark matter halo. Due to the enhanced mass density, the compressed wave dark
matter halo exerts stronger dynamical friction on the orbiting object, leading
to the dephasing of the gravitational waves. The pattern of dephasing is
distinctive from that of inspirals in the particle dark matter halo because of
the difference in density profile and because of the relatively suppressed
dynamical friction force, originating from the wave nature of dark matter. We
investigate the prospects of future gravitational wave detectors, such as Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna, and identify physics scenarios where the wave
dark matter halo can be reconstructed from gravitational wave observations.

decentralized optimization and learning involving sensitive data. Despite some
recent advances addressing each of the two problems separately, no results have
been reported that have theoretical guarantees on both privacy protection and
saddle/maximum avoidance in decentralized nonconvex optimization. We propose a
new algorithm for decentralized nonconvex optimization that can enable both
rigorous differential privacy and saddle/maximum avoiding performance. The new
algorithm allows the incorporation of persistent additive noise to enable
rigorous differential privacy for data samples, gradients, and intermediate
optimization variables without losing provable convergence, and thus
circumventing the dilemma of trading accuracy for privacy in differential
privacy design. More interestingly, the algorithm is theoretically proven to be
able to efficiently { guarantee accuracy by avoiding} convergence to local
maxima and saddle points, which has not been reported before in the literature
on decentralized nonconvex optimization. The algorithm is efficient in both
communication (it only shares one variable in each iteration) and computation
(it is encryption-free), and hence is promising for large-scale nonconvex
optimization and learning involving high-dimensional optimization parameters.
Numerical experiments for both a decentralized estimation problem and an
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

agent optimizes the cumulative reward directly. Moreover, in the continuous
action domain, parameterized distribution of action distribution allows easy
control of exploration, resulting from the variance of the representing
distribution. Entropy can play an essential role in policy optimization by
selecting the stochastic policy, which eventually helps better explore the
environment in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the stochasticity often
reduces as the training progresses; thus, the policy becomes less exploratory.
Additionally, certain parametric distributions might only work for some
environments and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. This paper aims to
mitigate these issues. In particular, we propose an algorithm called Robust
Policy Optimization (RPO), which leverages a perturbed distribution. We
hypothesize that our method encourages high-entropy actions and provides a way
to represent the action space better. We further provide empirical evidence to
verify our hypothesis. We evaluated our methods on various continuous control
tasks from DeepMind Control, OpenAI Gym, Pybullet, and IsaacGym. We observed
that in many settings, RPO increases the policy entropy early in training and
then maintains a certain level of entropy throughout the training period.
Eventually, our agent RPO shows consistently improved performance compared to
PPO and other techniques: entropy regularization, different distributions, and
data augmentation. Furthermore, in several settings, our method stays robust in
performance, while other baseline mechanisms fail to improve and even worsen
the performance.

construct all non-equivalent admissible graphs, up to the appropriate

investigated as the locus of synchrony states supported by an admissible graph,
in the sense that a suitable graph can be chosen to realize couplings with more
(or less) synchrony than another graph admissible to the same vector field. The
approach provides in particular a systematic investigation of occurrence of

are documented in the electronic health record (EHR) through structured data

comprehensive SDOH information, detailing aspects such as status, severity, and
temporality. This work has two primary objectives: i) develop a natural
language processing (NLP) information extraction model to capture detailed SDOH
information and ii) evaluate the information gain achieved by applying the SDOH
extractor to clinical narratives and combining the extracted representations
with existing structured data.
  Materials and Methods: We developed a novel SDOH extractor using a deep
learning entity and relation extraction architecture to characterize SDOH
across various dimensions. In an EHR case study, we applied the SDOH extractor
to a large clinical data set with 225,089 patients and 430,406 notes with
social history sections and compared the extracted SDOH information with
existing structured data.
  Results: The SDOH extractor achieved 0.86 F1 on a withheld test set. In the
EHR case study, we found extracted SDOH information complements existing
structured data with 32% of homeless patients, 19% of current tobacco users,
and 10% of drug users only having these health risk factors documented in the

  Conclusions: Utilizing EHR data to identify SDOH health risk factors and
social needs may improve patient care and outcomes. Semantic representations of

development of an open-source tool (Build-a-Bot) for students and teachers to
not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course
material, but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation
process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for
students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural
language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on
their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their
instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed
on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data
collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by
having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent,
diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots
as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI
capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In
addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for
students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our

to the intellectual property. We consider such a setting with a black-box
job-shop system and an unknown scheduling heuristic that, for a given
permutation of jobs, schedules the jobs for the black-box job-shop with the
goal of minimizing the makespan. Here, the jobs need to enter the job-shop in
the given order of the permutation, but may take different paths within the job
shop, which depends on the black-box heuristic. The performance of the
black-box heuristic depends on the order of the jobs, and the natural problem
for the manufacturer is to find an optimum ordering of the jobs.
  Facing a real-world scenario as described above, we engineer the Monte-Carlo
tree-search for finding a close-to-optimum ordering of jobs. To cope with a
large solutions-space in planning scenarios, a hierarchical Monte-Carlo tree
search (H-MCTS) is proposed based on abstraction of jobs. On synthetic and
real-life problems, H-MCTS with integrated abstraction significantly
outperforms pure heuristic-based techniques as well as other Monte-Carlo search
variants. We furthermore show that, by modifying the evaluation metric in
H-MCTS, it is possible to achieve other optimization objectives than what the
scheduling heuristics are designed for -- e.g., minimizing the total completion
time instead of the makespan. Our experimental observations have been also
validated in real-life cases, and our H-MCTS approach has been implemented in a

is a solute surrounded by an explicit solvation shell. One way to approach this
problem is to enclose the small system of interest in a large bath of explicit
solvent molecules, considerably larger than the system itself. The explicit
inclusion of the solvent degrees of freedom is obviously limited by the
available computational resources. A potential remedy to this problem is a
microsolvation approach where only a few explicit solvent molecules are
considered and surrounded by an implicit solvent bath. Still, the sampling of
the solvent degrees of freedom is challenging with conventional grand canonical
Monte Carlo methods, since no single chemical potential for the solvent
molecules can be defined in the realm of small-system thermodynamics. In this
work, a statistical thermodynamic model based on the grand canonical ensemble
is proposed that avoids the conventional system size limitations and accurately
characterizes the properties of the system of interest subject to the

flight altitude, and Mach number on the ignition transient and chemical
timescales are investigated. The results show that the ratio of chemical
excitation time to ignition delay time can be used to predict the oblique
detonation wave (ODW) transition mode. When the ratio is relatively high, the
combustion heat release is slow and smooth transition is more likely to occur.
In heterogeneous ignition, there are direct interactions between the
evaporating droplets and the induction/ignition process, and the chemical
explosive propensity changes accordingly. The energy absorption of evaporating
droplets significantly retards the ignition of n-heptane vapor. In the
two-phase n-heptane mixture autoignition process, the ignition delay time
decreases exponentially with flight Mach number, and increases first and then
decreases with the flight altitude. As the liquid ER increases, both ignition
delay time and droplet evaporation time increase. With increased droplet
diameter, the ignition delay time decreases, and the evaporation time
increases. Besides, for Mach number is less than 10, the ratio of the chemical
excitation time to ignition delay time generally increases with the flight
altitude or Mach number. It increases when the liquid ER decreases or droplet
diameter increases. When Mach number is sufficiently high, it shows limited
change with fuel and inflow conditions. The results from this work can provide
insights into spray ODW initiation. The ODW is more likely to be initiated with
a smooth transition at high altitude or Mach number. Abrupt transition mode

high-dimensional settings. In this work, we present BanditMIPS, a novel
randomized MIPS algorithm whose complexity is independent of $d$. BanditMIPS
estimates the inner product for each atom by subsampling coordinates and
adaptively evaluates more coordinates for more promising atoms. The specific
adaptive sampling strategy is motivated by multi-armed bandits. We provide
theoretical guarantees that BanditMIPS returns the correct answer with high
probability, while improving the complexity in $d$ from $O(\sqrt{d})$ to
$O(1)$. We also perform experiments on four synthetic and real-world datasets
and demonstrate that BanditMIPS outperforms prior state-of-the-art algorithms.
For example, in the Movie Lens dataset ($n$=4,000, $d$=6,000), BanditMIPS is
20$\times$ faster than the next best algorithm while returning the same answer.
BanditMIPS requires no preprocessing of the data and includes a hyperparameter

flows and Gaussian process regression. The model is motivated by the need to
characterize uncertainty in the input/output relationship when making
inferences on new data. In particular, in the physical sciences, limited
training data may not adequately characterize future observed data; it is
critical that models adequately indicate uncertainty, particularly when they
may be asked to extrapolate. In our proposed model, structured conditional
normalizing flows provide parsimonious latent representations that relate to
the inputs through a Gaussian process, providing exact likelihood calculations
and uncertainty that naturally increases away from the training data inputs. We
demonstrate the methodology on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data from
the ChemCam instrument onboard the Mars rover Curiosity. ChemCam was designed
to recover the chemical composition of rock and soil samples by measuring the
spectral properties of plasma atomic emissions induced by a laser pulse. We
show that our model can generate realistic spectra conditional on a given
chemical composition and that we can use the model to perform uncertainty
quantification of chemical compositions for new observed spectra. Based on our
results, we anticipate that our proposed modeling approach may be useful in
other scientific domains with high-dimensional, complex structure where it is
important to quantify predictive uncertainty.

defined through the nucleation condition: on average one bubble has nucleated
per Hubble volume. We argue that the nucleation temperature is neither a
fundamental nor essential quantity in phase transition analysis. We illustrate
scenarios where a transition can complete without satisfying the nucleation
condition, and conversely where the nucleation condition is satisfied but the
transition does not complete. We also find that simple nucleation heuristics,
which are defined to approximate the nucleation temperature, break down for
strong supercooling. Thus, studies that rely on the nucleation temperature

temperature is directly connected to transition progress and the collision of
bubbles. Finally, we provide model-independent bounds on the bubble wall
velocity that allow one to predict whether a transition completes based only on
knowledge of the bounce action curve. We apply our methods to find empirical
bounds on the bubble wall velocity for which the physical volume of the false

minimization is over auxiliary functions that are defined on the state space

when the ODE's right-hand side is polynomial, the set of interest can be

hysteresis is a promising technique to contrast the three dynamics by exploring
signatures of the most basic thixotropic, anti-thixotropic, and nonlinear
viscoelastic models. From these signatures, using shear-rate controlled ramps
that begin and end at high shear rates, we identify two distinguishing features
in hysteresis loops. The first is the direction of the hysteresis loops:
clockwise for thixotropy, but counterclockwise for viscoelasticity and
anti-thixotropy. A second feature is achieved at high ramping rates where all
responses lose hysteresis: the viscoelastic response shows a stress plateau at
low shear rates (lack of stress relaxation), whereas the thixotropic and
anti-thixotropic responses are purely viscous with minimal shear thinning or
thickening. The features are observed independent of the model details. We
establish further evidence for these signatures by experimentally measuring the

matrix-valued scattering coefficients for the fragments. Using the
factorization formula, some explicit examples are provided illustrating that in
general the left and right matrix-valued transmission coefficients are unequal.
A unitary transformation is established between the full-line matrix
Schr\""odinger operator and the half-line matrix Schr\""odinger operator with a
particular selfadjoint boundary condition and by relating the full-line and
half-line potentials appropriately. Using that unitary transformation, the
relations are established between the full-line and the half-line quantities
such as the Jost solutions, the physical solutions, and the scattering
matrices. Exploiting the connection between the corresponding full-line and
half-line scattering matrices, Levinson's theorem on the full line is proved
and is related to Levinson's theorem on the half line.

mathematically transformed into a specific structured singular value

bidiagonalization (SSLBD) method is proposed for the specific SVD problem that
computes extreme singular values and the corresponding singular vectors of $A$,
from which the eigenpairs of $A$ corresponding to the extreme conjugate
eigenvalues in magnitude are recovered pairwise in real arithmetic. A number of
convergence results on the method are established, and accuracy estimates for
approximate singular triplets are given. In finite precision arithmetic, it is
proven that the semi-orthogonality of each set of basis vectors and the
semi-biorthogonality of two sets of basis vectors suffice to compute the
singular values accurately. A commonly used efficient partial
reorthogonalization strategy is adapted to maintaining the needed
semi-orthogonality and semi-biorthogonality. For a practical purpose, an
implicitly restarted SSLBD algorithm is developed with partial
reorthogonalization. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and
overall efficiency of the algorithm.

when plastic effects dominate, a new scaling range emerges between the inertial

fluid plasticity. The enhanced intermittency is caused by the non-Newtonian

have relevance to catastrophic events in natural flows, such as landslides and

that our pre-training approach improves the accuracy of pre- and post-dialysis

extractor include that it is not source-biased and it provides an alternate

Such pre-trained feature extractors are also publicly available, which allows
us to readily leverage modern network architectures that have strong

table discovery has become an important operation in data lake management.
Existing approaches target equi-joins, the most common way of combining tables
for creating a unified view, or semantic joins, which tolerate misspellings and
different formats to deliver more join results. They are either exact solutions
whose running time is linear in the sizes of query column and target table
repository or approximate solutions lacking precision. In this paper, we
propose Deepjoin, a deep learning model for accurate and efficient joinable
table discovery. Our solution is an embedding-based retrieval, which employs a
pre-trained language model (PLM) and is designed as one framework serving both
equi- and semantic joins. We propose a set of contextualization options to
transform column contents to a text sequence. The PLM reads the sequence and is
fine-tuned to embed columns to vectors such that columns are expected to be
joinable if they are close to each other in the vector space. Since the output
of the PLM is fixed in length, the subsequent search procedure becomes
independent of the column size. With a state-of-the-art approximate nearest
neighbor search algorithm, the search time is logarithmic in the repository
size. To train the model, we devise the techniques for preparing training data
as well as data augmentation. The experiments on real datasets demonstrate that
by training on a small subset of a corpus, Deepjoin generalizes to large
datasets and its precision consistently outperforms other approximate
solutions'. Deepjoin is even more accurate than an exact solution to semantic
joins when evaluated with labels from experts. Moreover, when equipped with a
GPU, Deepjoin is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions.

Magnetic orders are found using the Stoner criterion. The most likely

angular momentum, $J=1/2$ states. Moreover, an $s_{\pm}$-order which mixes
different bands is found at high Hund's coupling, and at high strain

combines the score-based prior with low-rank regularization penalty to

Non-local regularization is employed to supplement the knowledge of patches

classes under low data regimes is charming yet challenging. In few-shot object
detection (FSOD), the two-step training paradigm is widely adopted to mitigate
the severe sample imbalance, i.e., holistic pre-training on base classes, then
partial fine-tuning in a balanced setting with all classes. Since unlabeled
instances are suppressed as backgrounds in the base training phase, the learned
RPN is prone to produce biased proposals for novel instances, resulting in
dramatic performance degradation. Unfortunately, the extreme data scarcity
aggravates the proposal distribution bias, hindering the RoI head from evolving
toward novel classes. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
proposal distribution calibration (PDC) approach to neatly enhance the
localization and classification abilities of the RoI head by recycling its
localization ability endowed in base training and enriching high-quality
positive samples for semantic fine-tuning. Specifically, we sample proposals
based on the base proposal statistics to calibrate the distribution bias and
impose additional localization and classification losses upon the sampled
proposals for fast expanding the base detector to novel classes. Experiments on
the commonly used Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets with explicit

leveraged the inherent modality correlation information stored in samples for
self-supervised learning. However, they feed the training pairs in a random
order without consideration of difficulty. Without human annotation, the
generated training pairs of self-supervised learning often contain noise. If
noisy or hard pairs are used for training at the easy stage, the model might be
stuck in bad local optimum. In this paper, we inject curriculum learning into
weakly supervised modality correlation learning. The weakly supervised
correlation learning leverages the label information to generate scores for
negative pairs to learn a more discriminative embedding space, where negative
pairs are defined as two unimodal embeddings from different samples. To assist
the correlation learning, we feed the training pairs to the model according to
difficulty by the proposed curriculum learning, which consists of elaborately
designed scoring and feeding functions. The scoring function computes the
difficulty of pairs using pre-trained and current correlation predictors, where
the pairs with large losses are defined as hard pairs. Notably, the hardest
pairs are discarded in our algorithm, which are assumed as noisy pairs.
Moreover, the feeding function takes the difference of correlation losses as
feedback to determine the feeding actions (`stay', `step back', or `step

the most general 2HDM potential with explicit CP violation in the Higgs basis
which contains the three CP-mixed neutral mass eigenstates $H_1$, $H_2$, and
$H_3$ with $M_{H_1}\leq M_{H_2}\leq M_{H_3}$. The high-precision CDF
measurement of the $W$ boson mass is characterized by the large positive value
of the $T$ parameter. By identifying the lightest neutral Higgs boson $H_1$ as
the SM-like one discovered at the LHC, we find that it is necessary to have the
mass splitting between the charged Higgs boson $H^\pm$ and the second heaviest
neutral one $H_2$ to accommodate the sizable positive deviation of the $T$
parameter from its SM value of $0$. By combining the mass splitting between
$H^\pm$ and $H_2$ with the theoretical constraints from the perturbative
unitarity and for the Higgs potential to be bounded from below, we implement
comprehensive analysis of the mass spectrum of the heavy Higgs bosons taking
account of the effects of deviation from the alignment limit and also the mass
splitting between $H_3$ and $H_2$. We further analyze the behavior of the
heavy-Higgs mass spectrum according to the variation of the $T$ parameter.
Finally, we discuss some benchmarking scenarios for the searches of heavy Higgs

a fundamental task for many applications. However, large variations in the
scales of objects in those VHR images pose a challenge for performing accurate
semantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation networks are able to
analyse an input image at up to four resizing scales, but this may be
insufficient given the diversity of object scales. Therefore, Multi Scale (MS)
test-time data augmentation is often used in practice to obtain more accurate
segmentation results, which makes equal use of the segmentation results
obtained at the different resizing scales. However, it was found in this study
that different classes of objects had their preferred resizing scale for more
accurate semantic segmentation. Based on this behaviour, a Stacking-Based
Semantic Segmentation (SBSS) framework is proposed to improve the segmentation
results by learning this behaviour, which contains a learnable Error Correction
Module (ECM) for segmentation result fusion and an Error Correction Scheme
(ECS) for computational complexity control. Two ECS, i.e., ECS-MS and ECS-SS,
are proposed and investigated in this study. The Floating-point operations
(Flops) required for ECS-MS and ECS-SS are similar to the commonly used MS test
and the Single-Scale (SS) test, respectively. Extensive experiments on four
datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, UAVid, LoveDA and Potsdam) show that SBSS is an
effective and flexible framework. It achieved higher accuracy than MS when
using ECS-MS, and similar accuracy as SS with a quarter of the memory footprint
when using ECS-SS.

(ROCK-PCA) introduced in (Bueso et al., 2019, 2020), where we proposed the same
approach: first transform the data to the complex plane with the Hilbert
transform and then apply the varimax rotation, with the only difference that
the eigendecomposition is performed in the dual (kernel) Hilbert space. The
latter allows us to generalize the xMCA solution by extracting nonlinear
(curvilinear) features when nonlinear kernel functions are used. Hence, the
solution of xMCA boils down to ROCK-PCA when the inner product is computed in
the input data space instead of in the high-dimensional (possibly infinite)
kernel Hilbert space to which data has been mapped. In this short
correspondence we show theoretical proof that xMCA is a special case of
ROCK-PCA and provide quantitative evidence that more expressive and informative
features can be extracted when working with kernels; results of the
decomposition of global sea surface temperature (SST) fields are shown to
illustrate the capabilities of ROCK-PCA to cope with nonlinear processes,
unlike xMCA.

study contains the familiar Riemannian Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory as
a particular limit and offers a natural extension, in which scalarization is
triggered by torsion and with new interesting phenomenology. We demonstrate
numerically the existence of asymptotically flat scalarized black hole

$\varepsilon>0$ and $\varepsilon^{b}$ with $\frac{3}{5}\leq b\leq 1$,
respectively. As $\varepsilon\to 0$ the formal Hilbert expansion gives the
fluid limit to the quasineutral compressible Euler system. We start from the
small-amplitude rarefaction wave of the Euler system that admits a smooth
approximation with a parameter
$\delta\sim\varepsilon^{\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{5}a}$, where the wave strength is
independent of $\varepsilon$ and we take $\frac{2}{3}\leq a\leq 1$ if
$\frac{2}{3}\leq b\leq 1$ and $4-5b\leq a\leq 1$ if $\frac{3}{5}\leq b<

construct the unique global classical solution to the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau
system around the rarefaction wave in the vanishing limit $\varepsilon\to 0$
and also obtain the global-in-time convergence of solutions toward the
rarefaction wave with rate
$\varepsilon^{\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{5}a}|\ln\varepsilon|$ in the

$\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}}|\ln\varepsilon|$ with the choice of $a=\frac{2}{3}$

the solution connects two fixed distinct states at the far fields $x=\pm\infty$
for all $t\geq 0$ and tends asymptotically as $\varepsilon\to 0$ toward a
profile determined by the macro density function under the quasineutral
assumption. Our strategy is based on an intricate weighted energy method
capturing the quartic dissipation to give uniform bounds of the nonlinear

hydropower stations. The diversion pipeline is an enclosed space, so the
airflow disturbance caused by the rotation of the UAV blades and the strong air
convection from the chimney effect have a great impact on the flight control of
the UAV. Although the traditional linear control PID flight control algorithm
has been widely used and can meet the requirements of general flight tasks, it
cannot guarantee the stability of the system over a wide range. The inspection
of a diversion line in an enclosed space requires high system stability and
robustness of the UAV controller. In this paper, a hybrid stabilised adaptive
backstepping control method is proposed. Firstly, a multi-rotor UAV model is
analysed and transformed into a strict feedback form with external
disturbances; then adaptive techniques are used to estimate the airflow
disturbances caused by the blades, and the attitude and position tracking
controllers are designed by combining backstepping control and PID control
respectively; finally, the asymptotic stability of the system is ensured by
constructing a Lyapunov function. The experimental data show that the flight
controller designed in this paper has good robustness and tracking performance,
and can better resist the disturbance caused by airflow disturbance in confined
space.

of the default choices to develop kernel-based classification and regression

to their lack of strict positive definiteness. In particular they do not enjoy
the usual property of unisolvency for arbitrary point sets, which is one of the
key properties used to build kernel-based interpolation methods. This paper is
devoted to establish some initial results for the study of these kernels, and
their related interpolation algorithms, in the context of approximation theory.
We will first prove necessary and sufficient conditions on point sets which
guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an interpolant. We will then study
the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (or native spaces) of these kernels and
their norms, and provide inclusion relations between spaces corresponding to
different kernel parameters. With these spaces at hand, it will be further
possible to derive generic error estimates which apply to sufficiently smooth
functions, thus escaping the native space. Finally, we will show how to employ
an efficient stable algorithm to these kernels to obtain accurate interpolants,
and we will test them in some numerical experiment. After this analysis several
computational and theoretical aspects remain open, and we will outline possible
further research directions in a concluding section. This work builds some

recursive solution of a suitable data-driven reformulation of a stochastic
Optimal Control Problem (OCP), which allows for forward prediction and
optimization of statistical distributions of inputs and outputs. Our approach
avoids the use of parametric system models. Instead it is based on previously
recorded data using a recently proposed stochastic variant of Willems'

the OCP -- which consists of information about past inputs and outputs -- is
considered as an extra decision variable of the OCP. We provide sufficient

traffic demand, especially in areas of dense deployment. To meet this demand,
however, network designers leverage tools that often require accurate estimates
of Channel State Information (CSI), which incurs a high overhead and thus
reduces network throughput. Furthermore, the overhead generally scales with the
number of clients, and so is of special concern in such massive IoT sensor
networks. While prior work has used transmissions over one frequency band to
predict the channel of another frequency band on the same link, this paper
takes the next step in the effort to reduce CSI overhead: predict the CSI of a
nearby but distinct link. We propose Cross-Link Channel Prediction (CLCP), a
technique that leverages multi-view representation learning to predict the
channel response of a large number of users, thereby reducing channel
estimation overhead further than previously possible. CLCP's design is highly
practical, exploiting channel estimates obtained from existing transmissions
instead of dedicated channel sounding or extra pilot signals. We have
implemented CLCP for two different Wi-Fi versions, namely 802.11n and 802.11ax,
the latter being the leading candidate for future IoT networks. We evaluate
CLCP in two large-scale indoor scenarios involving both line-of-sight and
non-line-of-sight transmissions with up to 144 different 802.11ax users.
Moreover, we measure its performance with four different channel bandwidths,
from 20 MHz up to 160 MHz. Our results show that CLCP provides a 2x throughput
gain over baseline 802.11ax and a 30 percent throughput gain over existing
cross-band prediction algorithms.

long-term geothermal energy supplies and reduce carbon emissions. Optimal
well-control scheme for effective heat extraction and improved heat sweep

optimization performance of most existing optimization algorithms deteriorates
as dimension increases. To solve this issue, a novel surrogate-assisted
level-based learning evolutionary search algorithm (SLLES) is proposed for heat
extraction optimization of enhanced geothermal system. SLLES consists of
classifier-assisted level-based learning pre-screen part and local evolutionary
search part. The cooperation of the two parts has realized the balance between
the exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. After
iteratively sampling from the design space, the robustness and effectiveness of
the algorithm are proven to be improved significantly. To the best of our
knowledge, the proposed algorithm holds state-of-the-art simulation-involved
optimization framework. Comparative experiments have been conducted on
benchmark functions, a two-dimensional fractured reservoir and a
three-dimensional enhanced geothermal system. The proposed algorithm
outperforms other five state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted algorithms on all
selected benchmark functions. The results on the two heat extraction cases also
demonstrate that SLLES can achieve superior optimization performance compared
with traditional evolutionary algorithm and other surrogate-assisted
algorithms. This work lays a solid basis for efficient geothermal extraction of
enhanced geothermal system and sheds light on the model management strategies
of data-driven optimization in the areas of energy exploitation.

chemical thermometers and evolutionary tracers to characterize star-forming
regions. Despite their importance in carrying information that is vital to
studies of the chemistry and evolution of star-forming regions, the collision
rates of some of these molecules have not been available for rigorous studies
in the past. We perform an up-to-date gas and dust chemical characterization of
two different star-forming regions, TMC 1-C and NGC 1333-C7, using new
collisional rates of HCN, HNC, and their isotopologues. We investigated the
possible effects of the environment and stellar feedback in their chemistry and
their evolution. With millimeter observations, we derived their column
densities, the C and N isotopic fractions, the isomeric ratios, and the
deuterium fractionation. The continuum data at 3 mm and 850 $\mu$m allowed us
to compute the emissivity spectral index and look for grain growth as an
evolutionary tracer. The H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C ratio is anticorrelated with the
deuterium fraction of HCN, thus it can readily serve as a proxy for the
temperature. The spectral index $(\beta\sim 1.34-2.09)$ shows a tentative
anticorrelation with the H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C ratio, suggesting grain growth
in the evolved, hotter, and less deuterated sources. Unlike TMC 1-C, the
south-to-north gradient in dust temperature and spectral index observed in NGC
1333-C7 suggests feedback from the main NGC 1333 cloud. With this up-to-date
characterization of two star-forming regions, we found that the chemistry and
the physical properties are tightly related. The dust temperature, deuterium
fraction, and the spectral index are complementary evolutionary tracers. The
large-scale environmental factors may dominate the chemistry and evolution in
clustered star-forming regions.

well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that
training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to
gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple
weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced
by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a
regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when
training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the
models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the
weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained
Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in
their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression
problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context
learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore
identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by
learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data
representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss
intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context
learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be
understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent
learning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at

to observe the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS). From the LSS data, one can
use the baryon acoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion to trace the
expansion and growth history of the universe, and thus measure the dark energy
parameters. In this paper, we make a forecast for cosmological parameter
estimation with the synergy of three 21 cm IM experiments. Specifically, we
adopt a novel joint survey strategy, FAST ($0<z<0.35$)+SKA1-MID
($0.35<z<0.8$)+HIRAX ($0.8<z<2.5$), to measure dark energy. We simulate the 21
cm IM observations under the assumption of excellent foreground removal. We
find that the synergy of three experiments could place quite tight constraints
on cosmological parameters. For example, it provides $\sigma(\Omega_{\rm
m})=0.0039$ and $\sigma(H_0)=0.27\ \rm km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$ in the
$\Lambda$CDM model. Notably, the synergy could break the cosmological parameter
degeneracies when constraining the dynamical dark energy models. Concretely,
the joint observation offers $\sigma(w)=0.019$ in the $w$CDM model, and
$\sigma(w_0)=0.085$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.32$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model. These
results are better than or equal to those given by CMB+BAO+SN. In addition,
when the foreground removal efficiency is relatively low, the strategy still
performs well. Therefore, the 21 cm IM joint survey strategy is promising and
worth pursuing.

find applications in surgery, interventional radiology and radiotherapy. By
estimating a three-dimensional displacement field from a 2D X-ray image,
anatomical structures segmented in the preoperative scan can be projected onto
the 2D image, thus providing a mixed reality view. Methods: A dataset composed
of displacement fields and 2D projections of the anatomy is generated from the
preoperative scan. From this dataset, a neural network is trained to recover
the unknown 3D displacement field from a single projection image. Results: Our
method is validated on lung 4D CT data at different stages of the lung
deformation. The training is performed on a 3D CT using random (non
domain-specific) diffeomorphic deformations, to which perturbations mimicking
the pose uncertainty are added. The model achieves a mean TRE over a series of

Conclusion: In this paper, a CNN-based method for real-time 2D-3D non-rigid

results from imaging analysis of type II radio burst band-splitting and other
fine structures, observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and extreme
ultraviolet observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on 2014-Sep-28. The MWA provides imaging-spectroscopy in
the range of 80-300 MHz with a time resolution of 0.5 s and frequency
resolution of 40 kHz. Our analysis shows that the burst was caused by a
piston-driven shock with a driver speed of $\sim$112 km s$^{-1}$ and shock
speed of $\sim$580 km s$^{-1}$. We provide rare evidence that band-splitting is
caused by emission from multiple parts of the shock (as opposed to the
upstream/downstream hypothesis). We also examine the small-scale motion of type
II fine structure radio sources in MWA images. We suggest that this small-scale
motion may arise due to radio propagation effects from coronal turbulence, and
not because of the physical motion of the shock location. We present a novel
technique that uses imaging spectroscopy to directly determine the effective
length scale of turbulent density perturbations, which is found to be 1 - 2 Mm.
The study of the systematic and small-scale motion of fine structures may
therefore provide a measure of turbulence in different regions of the shock and
corona.

So the solution can equally well described by an instanton solution. An
advantage is that antipodicity can be maintained without a ""cut-and-past""

open-quantum-system models such as Born--Markov master equations. However, it
is an open question how such codes perform in actual physical systems that, to
some extent, necessarily exhibit phenomena beyond the limits of these models.
To this end, we employ numerically exact open-quantum-system dynamics to
analyze the performance of a five-qubit error correction code where each qubit
is coupled to its own bath. We first focus on the performance of a single error
correction cycle covering time scales beyond that of Born--Markov models.
Namely, we observe distinct power law behavior of the channel infidelity
$\propto t^{2a}$: $a\lesssim 2$ in the ultrashort times $t<3/\omega_{\rm c}$
and $a\approx 1/2$ in the short-time range $3/\omega_{\rm c}<t<30/\omega_{\rm
c}$, where $\omega_{\rm c}$ is the cutoff angular frequency of the bath.
Importantly, the five-qubit quantum-error correction code suppresses all single
errors, including those arising from the ultrashort and short-time evolution,
which are peculiar to the exact evolution. Interestingly, we demonstrate the
breaking points of the five-qubit error correction code and the Born--Markov
models for repeated error correction when the repetition rate exceeds
$2\pi/\omega$ or the coupling strength $\kappa \gtrsim 0.1 \omega$, where
$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the qubit. Our results pave the way for

computational complexity of measuring the contribution of edges and vertices to
an answer to a path query, focusing on the class of conjunctive regular path
queries. To measure this contribution, we adopt the traditional Shapley value
from cooperative game theory. This value has been recently proposed and studied
in the context of relational database queries and has uses in a plethora of
other domains.
  We first study the contribution of edges and show that the exact Shapley
value is almost always hard to compute. Specifically, it is #P-hard to
calculate the contribution of an edge whenever at least one (non-redundant)
conjunct allows for a word of length three or more. In the case of regular path
queries (i.e., no conjunction), the problem is tractable if the query has only
words of length at most two; hence, this property fully characterizes the
tractability of the problem. On the other hand, if we allow for an
approximation error, then it is straightforward to obtain an efficient scheme
(FPRAS) for an additive approximation. Yet, a multiplicative approximation is
harder to obtain. We establish that in the case of conjunctive regular path
queries, a multiplicative approximation of the Shapley value of an edge can be
computed in polynomial time if and only if all query atoms are finite languages

study the analogous situation where we wish to determine the contribution of a

ports recognizing the potential of twinning have already started working on it.
However, since there is no clear consensus on what a digital twin of a complex
system comprises and how it should be designed, deployed digital twin solutions
for ports often differ significantly. This article addresses this issue by
initially identifying three core aspect underpinning digital twins of complex
systems, such as ports, and outlining five successive maturity levels based on
these aspects' instantiation. These identified aspects and the derived maturity
levels are then used to examine real-world cases by critically evaluating
existing digital twinning solutions in the port of Singapore, the Mawan port of
Shanghai, and that of Rotterdam. These being three of the world's
innovation-leading ports, we naturally find in them most of the identified core
aspects to be in line with their twinning implementation, which has reached, in
all three, a higher level of maturity. Although, our work on maturity levels
and core aspects can provide a guideline for designing and benchmarking future
digital twinning solutions for ports, the capacity for innovation via twinning,
even in the port domain, is highly contextual with key paragon being the

has a wide range of applications in practice. One of these applications is the
monitoring and assessment of the actual condition of infrastructure buildings,
as the material parameters directly reflect the resistance of the structures to
external impacts. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently
emerged as a suitable method for solving inverse problems. The advantages of
this method are a straightforward inclusion of observation data. Unlike
grid-based methods, such as the finite element method updating (FEMU) approach,
no computational grid and no interpolation of the data is required. In the
current work, we aim to further develop PINNs towards the calibration of the
linear-elastic constitutive model from full-field displacement and global force
data in a realistic regime. We show that normalization and conditioning of the
optimization problem play a crucial role in this process. Therefore, among
others, we identify the material parameters for initial estimates and balance
the individual terms in the loss function. In order to reduce the dependence of
the identified material parameters on local errors in the displacement
approximation, we base the identification not on the stress boundary conditions
but instead on the global balance of internal and external work. In addition,
we found that we get a better posed inverse problem if we reformulate it in
terms of bulk and shear modulus instead of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.
We demonstrate that the enhanced PINNs are capable of identifying material
parameters from both experimental one-dimensional data and synthetic full-field
displacement data in a realistic regime. Since displacement data measured by,
e.g., a digital image correlation (DIC) system is noisy, we additionally
investigate the robustness of the method to different levels of noise.

..., x_n} be a set of positive integers. The LCM matrix [S] is the n $\times$ n
matrix with lcm(x_i , x_j) as its ij entry. During the last 30 years
singularity of LCM matrices has interested many authors. In 1992 Bourque and
Ligh ended up conjecturing that if the GCD closedness of the set S (which means
that gcd(x_i, x_j) $\in$ S for all i, j $\in$ {1, 2, . . . , n}), suffices to
guarantee the invertibility of the matrix [S]. However, a few years later this
conjecture was proven false first by Haukkanen et al. and then by Hong. It
turned out that the conjecture holds only on GCD closed sets with at most 7
elements but not in general for larger sets. However, the given counterexamples
did not give much insight on why does the conjecture fail exactly in the case
when n=8. This situation was later improved in a couple of articles, where a
new lattice theoretic approach was introduced (the method is based on the fact
that because the set S is assumed to be GCD closed, the structure (S, |)
actually forms a meet semilattice). For example, it has been shown that in the
case when the set S has 8 elements and the matrix [S] is singular, there is
only one option for the semilattice structure of (S, |), namely the cube
structure.
  Since the cases up to n=8 have been thoroughly studied in various articles,
the next natural step is to apply the methods to the case n=9. This was done by
Altinisik and Altintaa as they consider the different lattice structures of (S,
|) with nine elements that can result in a singular LCM matrix [S]. However,
their investigation leaves two open questions, and the main purpose of this
presentation is to provide solutions to them. We shall also give a new lattice
theoretic proof for a result referred to as Sun's conjecture, which was
originally proven by Hong via number theoretic approach.

proposed algorithm. Thus the position-based beam training can be performed. To
enhance the beam-forming gain, we further combine with channel estimation and
propose a semi-passive structure of the STAR and ambiguity elimination scheme
for separated channel estimation. Thus the ambiguity in cascaded channel
estimation, which may affect optimal passive beamforming, is avoided. The
optimal active and passive beamforming are then carried out and data
transmission is initiated. The proposed BS sub-array and sub-STAR spatial
multiplexing architecture, optimal active and passive beamforming, digital
precoding, and optimal position of the UAV- mounted STAR are investigated
jointly to maximize the average achievable sum rate of the users. Moreover, the

that derived from the CMB, thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here we
present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various
hypotheses using the Bayesian evidence. We find unambiguous evidence for the
presence of a dipole in the distribution of quasars with a direction that is
consistent with the dipole identified in the CMB. However, the amplitude of the
dipole is found to be 2.7 times larger than that expected from the conventional
kinematic explanation of the CMB dipole, with a statistical significance of
$5.7\sigma$. To compare these results with theoretical expectations, we sharpen
the $\Lambda$CDM predictions for the probability distribution of the amplitude,
taking into account a number of observational and theoretical systematics. In
particular, we show that the presence of the galactic plane mask causes a
considerable loss of dipole signal due to a leakage of power into higher
multipoles, exacerbating the discrepancy in the amplitude. By contrast, we
estimate using probabilistic arguments that the source evolution of quasars
improves the discrepancy, but only mildly so. These results support the
original findings of an anomalously large quasar dipole, independent of the

between modulation instability and rogue wave patterns, which develops the
previously reported inequality relation into an equation correspondence. As an
example, we demonstrate phase diagrams for rogue wave patterns in a
two-component coupled system, based on the complete classification of their
spatial-temporal structures. The phase diagrams enable us to predict various
rogue wave patterns, such as the ones with a four-petaled structure in both
components. These results are meaningful for controlling the rogue wave
excitations in two orthogonal polarization optical fibers.

in estimating the effects of explosion events in urban environments, for the
purpose of ensuring the security and safety of cities. Such simulations are
computationally expensive and, often, the time taken for one single computation
is large and does not permit parametric studies. The aim of this work is
therefore to facilitate real-time and multi-query calculations by employing a
non-intrusive Reduced Order Method (ROM).
  We propose a deep learning-based (DL) ROM scheme able to deal with fast
transient dynamics. In the case of blast waves, the parametrised PDEs are
time-dependent and non-linear. For such problems, the Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD), which relies on a linear superposition of modes, cannot
approximate the solutions efficiently. The piecewise POD-DL scheme developed
here is a local ROM based on time-domain partitioning and a first
dimensionality reduction obtained through the POD. Autoencoders are used as a
second and non-linear dimensionality reduction. The latent space obtained is
then reconstructed from the time and parameter space through deep forward
neural networks. The proposed scheme is applied to an example consisting of a
blast wave propagating in air and impacting on the outside of a building. The
efficiency of the deep learning-based ROM in approximating the time-dependent
pressure field is shown.

high stakes fields such as medicine, autonomous driving, and intelligence
analysis. Imbalanced data compounds the black-box nature of deep networks
because the relationships between classes may be highly skewed and unclear.
This can reduce trust by model users and hamper the progress of developers of
imbalanced learning algorithms. Existing methods that investigate imbalanced
data complexity are geared toward binary classification, shallow learning
models and low dimensional data. In addition, current eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques mainly focus on converting opaque deep learning
models into simpler models (e.g., decision trees) or mapping predictions for
specific instances to inputs, instead of examining global data properties and
complexities. Therefore, there is a need for a framework that is tailored to
modern deep networks, that incorporates large, high dimensional, multi-class
datasets, and uncovers data complexities commonly found in imbalanced data
(e.g., class overlap, sub-concepts, and outlier instances). We propose a set of
techniques that can be used by both deep learning model users to identify,
visualize and understand class prototypes, sub-concepts and outlier instances;
and by imbalanced learning algorithm developers to detect features and class
exemplars that are key to model performance. Our framework also identifies
instances that reside on the border of class decision boundaries, which can
carry highly discriminative information. Unlike many existing XAI techniques
which map model decisions to gray-scale pixel locations, we use saliency
through back-propagation to identify and aggregate image color bands across

analytically compute the spatial distribution, whose shape changes at a
critical value of the decay exponent $\alpha_{\rm cr} = (d+2)/2$. The exciton
always diffuses anomalously: a superdiffusive motion is associated to a L\'evy
stable distribution with long-range algebraic tails for $\alpha\leq\alpha_{\rm
cr}$, while for $\alpha > \alpha_{\rm cr}$ the distribution corresponds to a
surprising mixed Gaussian profile with long-range algebraic tails, leading to
the coexistence of short-range diffusion and long-range L\'evy-flights. In the
many-exciton case, we demonstrate that, starting from a domain-wall exciton
profile, algebraic tails appear in the distributions for any $\alpha$, which
affects thermalization: the longer the hopping range, the faster equilibrium is
reached. Our results are directly relevant to experiments with cold trapped
ions, Rydberg atoms and supramolecular dye aggregates. They provide a way to

quantify because the effect of a recombination event on patterns of variation
in a sample of genetic data can be hard to discern. Estimators for the
recombination rate, which are usually based on the idea of integrating over the
unobserved possible evolutionary histories of a sample, can therefore be noisy.
Here we consider a related question: how would an estimator behave if the
evolutionary history actually was observed? This would offer an upper bound on
the performance of estimators used in practice. In this paper we derive an
expression for the maximum likelihood estimator for the recombination rate
based on a continuously observed, multi-locus, Wright--Fisher diffusion of
haplotype frequencies, complementing existing work for an estimator of
selection. We show that, contrary to selection, the estimator has unusual
properties because the observed information matrix can explode in finite time
whereupon the recombination parameter is learned without error. We also show
that the recombination estimator is robust to the presence of selection in the
sense that incorporating selection into the model leaves the estimator
unchanged. We study the properties of the estimator by simulation and show that
its distribution can be quite sensitive to the underlying mutation rates.

$(3/4)k_c<k<k_c$ and $0<k<(3/4)k_c$, where $k_c$ is the critical value of $k$

Lyapunov exponent spectra together with the bifurcation diagram and phase-space

problem of class imbalance or on the problem of uncertainty, ignoring the

propose a framework based on Resnet and Attention to solve the above problems.
We design weight for each class. Through the penalty mechanism, our model will
pay more attention to the learning of small samples during training, and the
resulting decrease in model accuracy can be improved by a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM). Meanwhile, our backbone network will also learn an
uncertain feature for each sample. By mixing uncertain features between
samples, the model can better learn those features that can be used for
classification, thus suppressing uncertainty. Experiments show that our method
surpasses most basic methods in terms of accuracy on facial expression data

transition in the standard model extension with additional isospin $N$-plet
scalar field $\Phi_2$ under a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We find that
the multi-step phase transition could be triggered if there is a moderately
large coupling between the Higgs and the $\Phi_2$ and this coupling is required
to be larger as the mass of the $\Phi_2$ and/or isospin increase. The
first-order phase transition at the first (second) step can be realized by the
thermal loop (tree-level barrier) effects. Thus it is more likely that a
detectable spectrum of gravitational waves can be produced at the second step
of the phase transition.

this paper, an omnidirectional receiver based on 7-layer D2NN is first proposed
to alleviate the link alignment difficulties in UWOC systems. In addition, the
vectorial diffraction theory is introduced into the training of the D2NN to
obtain more accurate diffraction calculations compared with the prevalently
adopted scalar diffraction theory. Simulation results verify the validity of
the vectorial diffraction theory and demonstrate that the presented method can
focus incident light waves with tilt angles from 0 to 89 degrees in a 6.25%
area of the detection plane with an average focusing efficiency of 90.96%,
proving the feasibility of omnidirectional focusing at the receiver end. Extra
simulations further reveal that more layers do not lead to a sustained
performance improvement but rather reach a bottleneck, and the D2NN can achieve
omnidirectional focusing with a certain range of focusing region size. With
more effort, the proposed receiver design, which can be highly integrated with
detectors, holds promise to realize both omnidirectional and reliable link
establishment in UWOC systems in the future.

recognizers using global semantic information. We use a semantic module in an
encoder-decoder framework for extracting global semantic information to
recognize the Indic handwritten texts. The semantic information is used in both
the encoder for supervision and the decoder for initialization. The semantic
information is predicted from the word embedding of a pre-trained language
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on handwritten texts of ten Indic languages.

RGB images using an image signal processor (ISP). The images can then be used
for photography or visual computing tasks in a variety of applications, such as
public safety surveillance and autonomous driving. One can argue that since RAW
images contain all the captured information, the conversion of RAW to RGB using
an ISP is not necessary for visual computing. In this paper, we propose a novel
$\rho$-Vision framework to perform high-level semantic understanding and
low-level compression using RAW images without the ISP subsystem used for
decades. Considering the scarcity of available RAW image datasets, we first
develop an unpaired CycleR2R network based on unsupervised CycleGAN to train
modular unrolled ISP and inverse ISP (invISP) models using unpaired RAW and RGB
images. We can then flexibly generate simulated RAW images (simRAW) using any
existing RGB image dataset and finetune different models originally trained for
the RGB domain to process real-world camera RAW images. We demonstrate object
detection and image compression capabilities in RAW-domain using RAW-domain
YOLOv3 and RAW image compressor (RIC) on snapshots from various cameras.
Quantitative results reveal that RAW-domain task inference provides better
detection accuracy and compression compared to RGB-domain processing.
Furthermore, the proposed \r{ho}-Vision generalizes across various camera
sensors and different task-specific models. Additional advantages of the
proposed $\rho$-Vision that eliminates the ISP are the potential reductions in
computations and processing times.

subcarriers to be equalized with the channel frequency response (CFR) at a
single subcarrier. Subsequently, the detected data symbols are considered as
virtual pilots, and their CFRs are updated without additional pilot overhead.
Thereafter, the remaining channel estimation and equalization can be performed
in a sliding manner. With this approach, we use multiple channel estimates to
equalize the data at each subcarrier. This allows us to take advantage of

corroborate the above claims through extensive numerical analysis, showing the
superior performance of our proposed technique compared to conventional

complaints are often non-specific. Early detection of bone cancer is crucial

In this work, we propose an automatic algorithm to detect bone lesions in
conventional radiographs to facilitate early diagnosis. Detecting lesions in
such radiographs is challenging: first, the prevalence of bone cancer is very
low; any method must show high precision to avoid a prohibitive number of false
alarms. Second, radiographs taken in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or
emergency departments (EDs) suffer from inherent diversity due to different
X-ray machines, technicians and imaging protocols. This diversity poses a major
challenge to any automatic analysis method. We propose to train an
off-the-shelf object detection algorithm to detect lesions in radiographs. The
novelty of our approach stems from a dedicated preprocessing stage that
directly addresses the diversity of the data. The preprocessing consists of
self-supervised region-of-interest detection using vision transformer (ViT),
and a foreground-based histogram equalization for contrast enhancement to
relevant regions only. We evaluate our method via a retrospective study that
analyzes bone tumors on radiographs acquired from January 2003 to December 2018
under diverse acquisition protocols. Our method obtains 82.43% sensitivity at
1.5% false-positive rate and surpasses existing preprocessing methods. For
lesion detection, our method achieves 82.5% accuracy and an IoU of 0.69. The

  Since the discovery of quarks and the development of the QCD theory, there
has been a large interest in exotic hadrons, initiated by the tetraquark models
developed by Jaffe in 1977. Lattice QCD, being a first principle approach to
solve non-perturbative QCD, has been crucial not only to compute precise
results, but also to inspire research in hadronic physics.
  In the new millennium, this interest exploded with several experimental
discoveries of tetraquark and pentaquark resonances with heavy quarks, starting
with the Zc and Zb. Lattice QCD has not yet been able to comprehend this Z
class of tetraquarks, and is developing new methods to determine their masses,
decay widths and decay processes.
  The interest in tetraquarks was also fuelled by the lattice QCD prediction of
a second class of tetraquarks such as the Tbb, boundstates in the sense of
having no strong decays. Recently, the Tcc tetraquark, first predicted with
quark models in 1982 by Richard et al, was observed experimentally. We expect
the lattice QCD community will be able to explore this T class of tetraquarks
in more detail and with very precise results.
  We report on all the different direct and indirect approaches that lattice
QCD, with more focus on tetraquarks, has been employing to study exotic hadrons
with at least one heavy quark. We also briefly review the experimental progress
in observing tetraquarks and pentaquarks, and some of the theoretical paradigms
of tetraquarks, including three different types of mechanisms (diquark,
molecular and s pole), comparing them with the results of lattice QCD.

Clump~1 of the Leo ring, whose radial velocities are consistent with those of
Halpha lines but line widths are much smaller than observed for virialized
molecular clouds of similar mass in galaxies. The low signal-to-noise ratio,
the small line widths and the extremely low number densities suggest that a
more standard population of molecular clouds, still undetected, might be in
place. Using upper limits to the CO lines, the most sensitive pointed
observations show that the molecular gas mass surface density is lower than
expected from the extrapolation of the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
established in the disk of galaxies. The sparse stellar population in the ring,
possibly forming ultra diffuse dwarf galaxies, might then be the result of a
short molecular gas depletion time in this extreme environment.}

vertically bounded system of two immiscible fluids with slightly different
densities, conserve not only the mass and impulse but also the circulation and
energy. This is possible only at specific combinations of the upstream and
downstream states. Two such combinations are identified with arbitrary upstream
and downstream interface heights. The first has a cross symmetry between the
interface height and shear on both sides of the jump. This symmetry, which is
due to the invariance of the two-layer shallow-water system with swapping the
interface height and shear, ensures the automatic conservation of the impulse
and energy as well as the continuity of characteristic velocities across the
jump. The speed at which such jumps propagate is uniquely defined by the
conservation of the mass and circulation. The other possibility is a marginally
stable shear flow which can have fully conservative jumps with discontinuous
characteristic velocities. Both types of conservative jumps are shown to
represent a long-wave approximation to the so-called solibores which appear as
smooth permanent-shape solutions in a weakly non-hydrostatic model. A new
analytical solution for solibores is obtained and found to agree very well with
the previous DNS results for partial-depth lock release flow. The finding that
certain large-amplitude hydraulic jumps can be fully conservative, while most
are not such even in the inviscid approximation, points toward the wave
dispersion as a primary mechanism behind the lossy nature of internal bores.

when compression parameters are selected specifically for each layer. Finding
good combinations of compression parameters, so-called compression policies, is
hard as the problem spans an exponentially large search space. Effective
compression policies consider the influence of the specific hardware
architecture on the used compression methods. We propose an algorithmic
framework called Galen to search such policies using reinforcement learning
utilizing pruning and quantization, thus providing automatic compression for
neural networks. Contrary to other approaches we use inference latency measured
on the target hardware device as an optimization goal. With that, the framework
supports the compression of models specific to a given hardware target. We
validate our approach using three different reinforcement learning agents for
pruning, quantization and joint pruning and quantization. Besides proving the
functionality of our approach we were able to compress a ResNet18 for CIFAR-10,
on an embedded ARM processor, to 20% of the original inference latency without
significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, we can demonstrate that a joint search

search for policies using a single compression method.

scale can be avoided by an early phase of strong QCD. While most approaches
rely on theories where the strong coupling constant is determined through the
expectation value of some scalar field, we show that this mechanism can also be
implemented into the benchmark KSVZ and DFSZ models when the early phase of
strong QCD emerges by the modification of the running coupling during
inflation. For both models the physics that are responsible for making QCD
strong do not displace the axions minimum by too much, so that the efficiency
of the relaxation is controlled by parameters of the theory and the number of
inflationary e-folds. In particular, we consider the case of very efficient
relaxation where the axion abundance is dominated by inflationary quantum and
post-inflationary thermal fluctuations. Within this situation we identify the
parameter space compatible with all cosmological constrains and derive
conditions on the reheating temperature and the QCD scale during inflation that
result in the axion making up all the dark matter. Due to duality below the
Peccei-Quinn scale and a minor influence of the KSVZ and DFSZ fields on the
running, our findings also apply to a minimal 2-form implementation of the

have used the concept of meander devices for achieving synaptic functions. By
doing this, we have achieved 9 different resistive states in experiments. We

Additionally, we have engineered the anomalous Hall bars by incorporating
several pairs, in comparison to conventional Hall crosses, to increase the
sensitivity as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We performed micromagnetic

space for efficient similarity measuring, showing promising effectiveness in
various large-scale retrieval tasks. Since most existing methods commonly adopt
pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT) for parameter initialization, some work
focuses on proposing new pre-training tasks for compressing the useful semantic
information from passages into dense vectors, achieving remarkable
performances. However, it is still challenging to effectively capture the rich
semantic information and relations about passages into the dense vectors via
one single particular pre-training task. In this work, we propose a multi-task
pre-trained model, MASTER, that unifies and integrates multiple pre-training
tasks with different learning objectives under the bottlenecked masked
autoencoder architecture. Concretely, MASTER utilizes a multi-decoder
architecture to integrate three types of pre-training tasks: corrupted passages
recovering, related passage recovering and PLMs outputs recovering. By
incorporating a shared deep encoder, we construct a representation bottleneck
in our architecture, compressing the abundant semantic information across tasks
into dense vectors. The first two types of tasks concentrate on capturing the
semantic information of passages and relationships among them within the
pre-training corpus. The third one can capture the knowledge beyond the corpus
from external PLMs (e.g. GPT-2). Extensive experiments on several large-scale
passage retrieval datasets have shown that our approach outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods. Our code and data are

lowering the lasing threshold because it does not require the dissociation of

laser based on population inversion. In this work we propose a method to prove
unambiguously the polaritonic nature of lasing by combining experimental
measurements with a model accounting for the permittivity change as a function
of the carrier density. To do so we use angle resolved photoluminescence to
observe the lasing at cryogenic temperature from a polariton mode in a zinc
oxide waveguide structure, and to monitor the continuous shift of the
polaritonic dispersion towards a photonic dispersion as the optical intensity
of the pump is increased (up to 20 times the one at threshold). This shift is
reproduced thanks to a model taking into account the reduction of the
oscillator strength and the renormalization of the bandgap due to the screening
of the electrostatic interaction between electrons and holes. Furthermore, the
measurement of the carriers lifetime at optical intensities in the order of
those at which the polariton lasing occurs enables us to estimate the carrier
density, confirming it is lower than the corresponding Mott density for zinc
oxide reported in the literature.

the dataset they are trained on. In this study, we analyze the gender bias in
four different pre-trained word embeddings specifically for the depression
category in the mental disorder domain. We use contextual and non-contextual
embeddings that are trained on domain-independent as well as clinical
domain-specific data. We observe that embeddings carry bias for depression
towards different gender groups depending on the type of embeddings. Moreover,
we demonstrate that these undesired correlations are transferred to the
downstream task for depression phenotype recognition. We find that data
augmentation by simply swapping gender words mitigates the bias significantly
in the downstream task.

QueryPose, which can directly predict multi-person keypoint sequences from the
input image. The existing end-to-end methods rely on dense representations to
preserve the spatial detail and structure for precise keypoint localization.
However, the dense paradigm introduces complex and redundant post-processes
during inference. In our framework, each human instance is encoded by several
learnable spatial-aware part-level queries associated with an instance-level
query. First, we propose the Spatial Part Embedding Generation Module (SPEGM)
that considers the local spatial attention mechanism to generate several
spatial-sensitive part embeddings, which contain spatial details and structural
information for enhancing the part-level queries. Second, we introduce the
Selective Iteration Module (SIM) to adaptively update the sparse part-level
queries via the generated spatial-sensitive part embeddings stage-by-stage.
Based on the two proposed modules, the part-level queries are able to fully
encode the spatial details and structural information for precise keypoint
regression. With the bipartite matching, QueryPose avoids the hand-designed
post-processes and surpasses the existing dense end-to-end methods with 73.6 AP
on MS COCO mini-val set and 72.7 AP on CrowdPose test set. Code is available at

to two scalar-isospin doublet states with different SU(3) flavor content.
Within this formalism the lightest open charm positive parity states emerge as
being dynamically generated from the scattering of the Goldstone-boson octet
off $D$ mesons, a picture that at the same time solves various problems that
the experimental observations posed. However, in recent lattice studies of
$D\pi$ scattering at different pion masses only one pole was reported in the
$D_0^*$ channel, while it was not possible to extract reliable parameters of a
second pole from the lattice data. In this paper we demonstrate how this
seeming contradiction can be understood and that imposing SU(3) constraints on
the fitting amplitudes allows one to extract information on the second pole

showcase how approximate symmetries can be imposed in the $K$-matrix formalism

It is here studied mathematically. We first fix a topic for which we want to
find influential objects such as authors or journals, and their production,
such as publications generating citations. These objects are then said to have
a certain degree of impact. We work on three levels. On the first level, we
need a measure for these objects, represented by their rank-frequency function,
describing the number of items per source (ranked in decreasing order of the
number of items): an impact measure. These measures focus on the production of
the most productive sources. The h-index is one example. In paper II we study a
formal definition of impact measures based on these left-hand sides of the
source-item rank-frequency functions representing these objects. The second
level of impact investigation is using impact bundles (or sheaves) as in paper
III. As an illustration, we mention that the h-index of a function Z is defined
as x for which Z(x) = x, i.e., the abscissa of the intersection of the graph of
Z with the line y = x. The h-bundle is defined in the same way but now the line
y = x is replaced by an increasing line through the origin: y = $\theta$.x,
$\theta$ > 0. So, we have a bundle of impact measures which is more powerful to
measure the impact of an object Z. Impact bundles are characterized in paper
III. A third level of impact investigations involves the non-normalized form of
the Lorenz curve. In papers IV and V we study global impact measures as
measures that respect the non-normalized Lorenz order between the
rank-frequency functions representing objects Z. We say that object Z has more
impact than object Y if Y is smaller than Z in the sense of the non-normalized
Lorenz order. This is the highest level of impact treatment: a mathematical
definition of the concept itself.

the internal cohesion of a nation, and thus decreases polarization. We examine
this proposition by analyzing NATO discussion dynamics on Finnish social media
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In Finland, public
opinion on NATO had long been polarized along the left-right partisan axis, but
the invasion led to a rapid convergence of the opinion, and eventually led the
country to apply for NATO membership. We investigate how this depolarization
took place among polarized actors on Finnish Twitter. By analyzing retweeting
patterns, we find three separated user groups before the invasion: a pro-NATO,
a left-wing anti-NATO, and a conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group. After the
invasion, the left-wing anti-NATO group members broke out of their retweeting
bubble and connected with the pro-NATO group despite their difference in
partisanship, while the conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group mostly remained a
separate cluster. Our content analysis reveals that the left-wing anti-NATO
group and the pro-NATO group were likely bridged by a shared condemnation of
Russia's actions and shared democratic norms. Meanwhile the other anti-NATO
group, mainly built around conspiracy theories and disinformation, consistently
demonstrated a clear anti-NATO attitude and retained strong within-group
cohesion. Our findings show that an external threat can bridge partisan divides
in issues linked to the threat, while groups upheld by conspiracy theories and

bracket the most interesting $y$ regions for the prompt atmospheric neutrino
flux. At $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV foreseeen for the HL-LHC phase, nucleon collisions

operated as a qutrit in a particular execution cycle. This method, primarily
for the NISQ era, treats a qubit as a qutrit only for the duration when it
requires access to the state |2> during the computation. In this article, we
study the challenges of including fault-tolerance in such a decomposition. We
first show that any qubit which requires access to the state |2> at any point
in the circuit, must be encoded using a qutrit quantum error correcting code
(QECC), thus resulting in a circuit with both qubits and qutrits at the outset.
Since qutrits are noisier than qubits, the former is expected to require higher
levels of concatenation to achieve a particular accuracy than that for qubit
only decomposition. Next, we derive analytically (i) the number of levels of
concatenation required for qubit-qutrit and qubit only decompositions as a
function of the probability of error, and (ii) the criterion for which
qubit-qutrit decomposition leads to a lower gate count than qubit only
decomposition. We present numerical results for these two types of
decomposition, and obtain the situation where qubit-qutrit decomposition excels
for the example circuits of quantum adder, and Grover's algorithm.

spherical tracer particle in a viscoelastic medium, made of a long polymer
chain. Here, the interplay between viscoelasticity, stickiness, and activity
(self-propulsion) brings additional complexity to the tracer dynamics. Our
simulation shows that on increasing the stickiness of the tracer particle to
the polymer beads, the dynamics of the tracer particle slows down as it gets
stuck to the polymer chain, and moves along with it. But with increasing the
self-propulsion velocity, the dynamics gets enhanced. In case of increasing
stickiness as well as activity, the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP) exhibits
non-monotonic behavior, which also shows up in the re-scaled self part of the
van-Hove function. Non-Gaussianity results owing to the enhanced binding
events, and the sticky motion of the tracer along with the chain with
increasing stickiness. On the other hand, with increasing activity, initially
non-Gaussianity increases as the tracer moves through the heterogenous
polymeric environment but for higher activity, escapes resulting negative NGP.
For higher values of stickiness, the trapping time distributions of the passive
tracer particle broadens and have long tails. On the other hand, for a given
stickiness with increasing self-propulsion force, the same becomes narrower and
have short tails. We believe that our current simulation study will be helpful
in elucidating the complex motion of activity-driven probes in viscoelastic
media.

CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) during $\sim 6.4$ years of operation on
the International Space Station. An update of the energy spectrum of carbon is
also presented with an increase in statistics over our previous measurement.
The observed boron flux shows a spectral hardening at the same transition
energy $E_0 \sim 200$ GeV$/n$ of the C spectrum, though B and C fluxes have
different energy dependences. The spectral index of the B spectrum is found to
be $\gamma = -3.047\pm0.024$ in the interval $25 < E < 200$ GeV$/n$. The B
spectrum hardens by $\Delta \gamma_B=0.25\pm0.12$, while the best fit value for
the spectral variation of C is $\Delta \gamma_C=0.19\pm0.03$. The B/C flux
ratio is compatible with a hardening of $0.09\pm0.05$, though a single
power-law energy dependence cannot be ruled out given the current statistical
uncertainties. A break in the B/C ratio energy dependence would support the
recent AMS-02 observations that secondary cosmic rays exhibit a stronger
hardening than primary ones. We also perform a fit to the B/C ratio with a
leaky-box model of the cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy in order to probe a
possible residual value $\lambda_0$ of the mean escape path length $\lambda$ at
high energy. We find that our B/C data are compatible with a non-zero value of
$\lambda_0$, which can be interpreted as the column density of matter that
cosmic rays cross within the acceleration region.

and HESS has proven the promising future of GRB afterglow studies with the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the next-generation gamma-ray observatory.
With the unprecedented sensitivity of CTA, afterglow detection rates are
expected to increase dramatically. In this paper, we explore the
multi-dimensional afterglow parameter space to see the detectability of sub-TeV
photons by CTA. We use a one-zone electron synchrotron and synchrotron
self-Compton model to obtain the spectral energy distribution. We consider
bursts going off in a medium of homogenous density. The blast wave is assumed
to be radiatively inefficient and evolving adiabatically. Considering that the
electron acceleration is not efficient if the acceleration timescale exceeds
the radiative cooling timescale, we find that the Sub-TeV emission is always
due to the self-Compton process. We find that jets with high kinetic energy or
large bulk Lorentz factor decelerating into a dense ambient medium offer better
detection prospects for CTA. For relatively lower values of the downstream
magnetic field, electrons are slow-cooling, and the emitted radiation is
positively correlated with the magnetic field. For larger magnetic fields, the
electron population enters the fast cooling phase where the radiated flux is
inversely proportional to the magnetic field. We apply our results in the
context of bright TeV afterglows detected in recent years. Our results indicate
that cosmological short GRBs have only moderate prospects of detection by CTA
while local Neutron Star merger counterparts can be detected if the jet is
launched towards the observer.

access to all the cosmological information available. Given this incentive, in
this paper we investigate the performance of field-based forward modeling
approach to galaxy clustering using the effective field theory (EFT) framework
of large-scale structure (LSS). We do so by applying this formalism to a set of
consistency and convergence tests on synthetic datasets. We explore the
high-dimensional joint posterior of LSS initial conditions by combining
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling for the field of initial conditions, and slice
sampling for cosmology and model parameters. We adopt the Lagrangian
perturbation theory forward model from [1], up to second order, for the forward
model of biased tracers. We specifically include model mis-specifications in
our synthetic datasets within the EFT framework. We achieve this by generating
synthetic data at a higher cutoff scale $\Lambda_0$, which controls which
Fourier modes enter the EFT likelihood evaluation, than the cutoff $\Lambda$
used in the inference. In the presence of model mis-specifications, we find
that the EFT framework still allows for robust, unbiased joint inference of a)
cosmological parameters - specifically, the scaling amplitude of the initial
conditions - b) the initial conditions themselves, and c) the bias and noise
parameters. In addition, we show that in the purely linear case, where the
posterior is analytically tractable, our samplers fully explore the posterior
surface. We also demonstrate convergence in the cases of nonlinear forward
models. Our findings serve as a confirmation of the EFT field-based forward
model framework developed in [2-7], and as another step towards field-level
cosmological analyses of real galaxy surveys.

field and a fermionic field interacting via a simple Yukawa coupling, and
containing an exponential self-interaction potential for the scalar field.
Analyzing the evolution of this coupled scalar-fermion system in an expanding
Universe, we find that it initially behaves like radiation but then undergoes a
phase transition after which it behaves like pressureless dark matter. The one
free parameter of this model is the temperature at which the phase transition
occurs; the mass of the dark matter particle, given by the mass of the fermion,
is derived from this. For a phase transition temperature between 10 MeV and
$10^7$ GeV, the current dark matter relic density is achieved for a fermion
mass in the range of 1 GeV to $10^9$ GeV. In this dark matter model, the scalar
becomes a sub-dominant unclustered component of dark matter that can lower the
amplitude of structure formation by up to a few percent. Another feature is
that the mass-varying fermion component can lead to discrepant measurements of
the current dark matter density of about ten percent inferred from early and
late-time probes assuming LCDM.

super-resolution (SR) approaches to better upsample real-world images. Among
these methods, explicit kernel estimation approaches have demonstrated
unprecedented performance at handling unknown degradations. Nonetheless, a
number of limitations constrain their efficacy when used by downstream SR
models. Specifically, this family of methods yields i) excessive inference time
due to long per-image adaptation times and ii) inferior image fidelity due to
kernel mismatch. In this work, we introduce a learning-to-learn approach that
meta-learns from the information contained in a distribution of images, thereby
enabling significantly faster adaptation to new images with substantially
improved performance in both kernel estimation and image fidelity.
Specifically, we meta-train a kernel-generating GAN, named MetaKernelGAN, on a
range of tasks, such that when a new image is presented, the generator starts
from an informed kernel estimate and the discriminator starts with a strong
capability to distinguish between patch distributions. Compared with
state-of-the-art methods, our experiments show that MetaKernelGAN better
estimates the magnitude and covariance of the kernel, leading to
state-of-the-art blind SR results within a similar computational regime when
combined with a non-blind SR model. Through supervised learning of an
unsupervised learner, our method maintains the generalizability of the
unsupervised learner, improves the optimization stability of kernel estimation,

efficient control-theoretic method for dealing with exploding loss gradients

novel recurrent neural network (RNN) training framework for DS reconstruction
based on multimodal variational autoencoders (MVAE). The forcing signal for the

observed for ""REBO-based"" potential models of small initial defects, which is
interpreted as blunting effect observed for porous graphene. The temperature

transverse bond forces share the loading to account for the nonlinear increase
of fracture stress with shorter crack length. Anomalous kinetic energy
transportation along crack tips is observed for ""REBO-based"" potential models,

native binary that is shipped and executed within a TEE and when the
confidential code is an intermediate representation (IR) executed on top of a
runtime within a TEE. We show that executing IR code such as WASM bytecode on a
runtime executing in a TEE leaks most IR instructions with high accuracy and
therefore reveals the confidential code. Contrary to IR execution, native
execution is much less susceptible to leakage and largely resists even the most
powerful side-channel attacks. We evaluate native execution leakage in Intel
SGX and AMD SEV and experimentally demonstrate end-to-end instruction
extraction on Intel SGX, with WASM bytecode as IR executed within WAMR, a
hybrid between a JIT compiler and interpreter developed by Intel. Our

carefully labeled datasets, requiring expensive annotation budgets. In this
work, we show that coarse annotation is a low-cost but highly effective
alternative for training semantic segmentation models. Considering the urban
scene segmentation scenario, we leverage cheap coarse annotations for
real-world captured data, as well as synthetic data to train our model and show
competitive performance compared with finely annotated real-world data.
Specifically, we propose a coarse-to-fine self-training framework that
generates pseudo labels for unlabeled regions of the coarsely annotated data,
using synthetic data to improve predictions around the boundaries between
semantic classes, and using cross-domain data augmentation to increase
diversity. Our extensive experimental results on Cityscapes and BDD100k
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly better
performance vs annotation cost tradeoff, yielding a comparable performance to
fully annotated data with only a small fraction of the annotation budget. Also,
when used as pretraining, our framework performs better compared to the
standard fully supervised setting.

However, the traversable wormhole constraints yield solutions that violate all

relevant to look for wormhole solutions for these new theories. In this study,

nontrivial contributions coming from $f(Q,T)$ gravity are embedded into the

interpreted as consisting of rocky worlds, generally referred to as
super-Earths. This picture is largely corroborated by radial-velocity (RV) mass
measurements for close-in super-Earths but lacks constraints at lower
insolations. Here we present the results of a detailed study of the Kepler-138
system using 13 Hubble and Spitzer transit observations of the warm-temperate
$1.51\pm0.04~R_\oplus$ planet Kepler-138 d ($T_{\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3}}$~350 K)
combined with new Keck/HIRES RV measurements of its host star. We find evidence
for a volatile-rich ""water world"" nature of Kepler-138 d, with a large fraction
of its mass contained in a thick volatile layer. This finding is independently
supported by transit timing variations, RV observations
($M_d=2.1_{-0.7}^{+0.6}~M_\oplus$), as well as the flat optical/IR transmission
spectrum. Quantitatively, we infer a composition of $11_{-4}^{+3}$\% volatiles
by mass or ~51% by volume, with a 2000 km deep water mantle and atmosphere on
top of a core with an Earth-like silicates/iron ratio. Any hypothetical
hydrogen layer consistent with the observations ($<0.003~M_\oplus$) would have
swiftly been lost on a ~10 Myr timescale. The bulk composition of Kepler-138 d
therefore resembles those of the icy moons rather than the terrestrial planets
in the solar system. We conclude that not all super-Earth-sized planets are
rocky worlds, but that volatile-rich water worlds exist in an overlapping size
regime, especially at lower insolations. Finally, our photodynamical analysis
also reveals that Kepler-138 c ($R_c=1.51 \pm 0.04~R_\oplus$,

  Transition",,,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a thermodynamically consistent chemo-thermo-mechanical model for
the $\beta\rightarrow\delta$ phase transition of energetic HMX crystals. In
contrast to previous models, which either considered specific heat to be a
constant or utilized a calibrated function, this model provides novel
expressions for the specific heats at constant volume and constant elastic
strains derived directly from continuum mechanics. In addition, the model
provides a novel prediction for the critical temperature at which the chemical
heating rate achieves its extremum for Arrhenius kinetics. The numerical
solution predicts highly nonlinear specific heat behavior including order of
magnitude changes.

  Memorability Prediction and Modification",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As humans, we can remember certain visuals in great detail, and sometimes
even after viewing them once. What is even more interesting is that humans tend
to remember and forget the same things, suggesting that there might be some
general internal characteristics of an image to encode and discard similar
types of information. Research suggests that some pictures tend to be memorized
more than others. The ability of an image to be remembered by different viewers
is one of its intrinsic properties. In visualization and photography, creating
memorable images is a difficult task. Hence, to solve the problem, various
techniques predict visual memorability and manipulate images' memorability. We
present a comprehensive literature survey to assess the deep learning
techniques used to predict and modify memorability. In particular, we analyze
the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and
Generative Adversarial Networks for image memorability prediction and
modification.

  Post-stroke Motor Dysfunction Patient: A Review","Review paper",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely utilized to
study the motor deficits and rehabilitation following stroke. In particular,
functional connectivity(FC) analyses with fMRI at rest can be employed to
reveal the neural connectivity rationale behind this post-stroke motor function
impairment and recovery. However, the methods and findings have not been
summarized in a review focusing on post-stroke functional connectivity
analysis. In this context, we broadly review the static functional connectivity
network analysis (SFC) and dynamic functional connectivity network analysis
(DFC) for post-stroke motor dysfunction patients, aiming to provide method
guides and the latest findings regarding post-stroke motor function recovery.
Specifically, a brief overview of the SFC and DFC methods for fMRI analysis is
provided, along with the preprocessing and denoising procedures that go into
these methods. Following that, the current status of research in functional
connectivity networks for post-stoke patients under these two views was
synthesized individually. Results show that SFC is the most frequent
post-stroke functional connectivity analysis method. The SFC findings
demonstrate that the stroke lesion reduces FC between motor areas, and the FC
increase positively correlates with functional recovery. Meanwhile, the current
DFC analysis in post-stroke has just been uncovered as the tip of the iceberg
of its prospect, and its exceptionally rapidly progressing development can be
expected.

  of the dopaminergic pathway?",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human addiction, as a learned behaviour, has and is constantly being treated
psychologically, with specific and timely interventions from Neuroscience. We
endorse that human addiction can receive further boost as regards treatment,
when we firmly understand how it works from a quantum scale. This is majorly
because the dopaminergic pathway (DP) that is well elaborated in the brain of
every addict is connected to the memory pathway. This further implies that the
recall process in the brain of the addict, as regards his/her addiction is
fully functional in line with the pleasure that arises from the element of
his/her addiction. This dopamine-led pathway shows itself as prominent in what
pertains to addiction, this is because of the role it plays in reward. As a
neurotransmitter, dopamine flickers when reward is in the offing. It should be
noted that a full understanding of the dimensions of addiction in the human
person has not be attained to, therefore, we seek to add to this ongoing
research, by considering excerpts arising from Quantum Field Theory. We are
introducing excerpts from QFT, because DP, is an attendant element in the
process of reward and motivation. In clear terms, we are alluding that it all
begins with the memory.

optical carrier intensity modulated by a sinusoidal signal at 1 GHz is
up-converted to 9 GHz and 39 GHz. High Conversion Gains (CGs) of about 15 dB
are demonstrated for the frequency conversion to 9 GHz using both

employing Switching and Modulation architectures, respectively. Small-signal
equations for the up-converted signal in both architectures are formulated and
developed, which permit to quantify the CG from closed-form expressions. The
numerically calculated CG values are in very good agreement with those obtained
experimentally. The validated equations are subsequently employed to explain
the performance differences between the two architectures in terms of the CG.
Furthermore, signals modulated by QPSK and 16-QAM complex modulation formats at
different baud rates are up-converted from 750 MHz to 9.25 GHz and 39.75 GHz
and their Error Vector Magnitude is evaluated and compared. The maximum bit
rate that meets the Forward Error Correction (FEC) limit is achieved using the
Modulation architecture. It is 1 Gbps and 512 Mbps for QPSK and 16-QAM
modulations, respectively.
