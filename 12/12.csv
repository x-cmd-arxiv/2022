  cosmology","""Physics of the Dark Universe"" accepted",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new five-parameter entropy function that proves to be
singular-free during the entire cosmic evolution of the universe, and at the
same time, also generalizes the Tsallis, Barrow, R\'{e}nyi, Sharma-Mittal,
Kaniadakis and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies for suitable limits of the
parameters. In particular, all the above mentioned known entropies become
singular (or diverge) when the Hubble parameter vanishes in course of the
universe's evolution (for instance, in bounce cosmology at the instant of
bounce), while the newly proposed entropy function seems to be singular-free
even at $H = 0$ (where $H$ represents the Hubble parameter of the universe).
Such non-singular behaviour of the entropy function becomes useful in
describing bouncing scenario, in which case, the universe undergoes through $H
= 0$ at the instant of bounce. It turns out that the entropic cosmology
corresponding to the singular-free generalized entropy naturally allows
symmetric bounce scenarios, such as -- exponential bounce and quasi-matter
bounce scenario respectively. In the case of exponential bounce, the
perturbation modes are in the super-Hubble domain at the distant past, while
for the quasi-matter bounce, the perturbation modes generate in the deep
sub-Hubble regime far before the bounce and hence resolves the ``horizon
issue''. Based on this fact, we perform a detailed perturbation analysis for
the quasi-matter bounce in the present context of singular-free entropic
cosmology. Furthermore the entropic cosmology in the present context is shown
to be equivalent with the generalized holographic cosmology where the
holographic cut-offs are determined in terms of either future horizon and its
derivative or the particle horizon and its derivative.

planetary compositions and the potential for life. A long-lived carbon-and
nitrogen-rich chemistry at cold temperatures (<=50K) is observed within cold

small organic radicals in 1-10 Myr aged systems that would otherwise have
frozen out onto grains within 1 Myr. We explain how the chemistry of a
planet-forming disk evolves from a cosmic-ray/X-ray-dominated regime to an
ultraviolet-dominated chemical equilibrium. This, in turn, will bring about a
temporal transition in the chemical reservoir from which planets will accrete.
This photochemical dominated gas phase chemistry develops as dust evolves via
growth, settling and drift, and the small grain population is depleted from the
disk atmosphere. A higher gas-to-dust mass ratio allows for deeper penetration
of ultraviolet photons is coupled with a carbon-rich gas (C/O > 1) to form
carbon-bearing radicals and ions. This further results in gas phase formation
of organic molecules, which then would be accreted by any actively forming

Einstein gravity (with a positive cosmological constant) is recovered in the

_{\mu}$) becomes massive through a Stueckelberg mechanism, and it decouples. As
a first step in our investigations we write down the conformally invariant
gravitational action, containing a scalar degree of freedom, and the Weyl
vector. The field equations are derived from the variational principle in the
absence of matter. By adopting a static spherically symmetric geometry, the
vacuum field equations for the gravitational, scalar, and Weyl fields are
obtained. After reformulating the field equations in a dimensionless form, and
by introducing a suitable independent radial coordinate, we obtain their
solutions numerically. We detect the formation of a black hole from the
presence of a Killing horizon for the timelike Killing vector in the metric
tensor components, indicating the existence of the singularity in the metric.
Several models, corresponding to different functional forms of the Weyl vector,
are considered. An exact black hole model, corresponding to a Weyl vector
having only a radial spacelike component, is also obtained. The thermodynamic
properties of the Weyl geometric type black holes (horizon temperature,
specific heat, entropy and evaporation time due to Hawking luminosity) are also

Separate pressure, interferometric laser imaging for droplet sizing,

characterization. Simultaneous 10 kHz flame chemiluminescence and 0.2 Hz Mie
scattering measurements are performed for the purposes of the framework
development and the number of droplets prediction. Both methane and/or Jet A-1
are used in the experiments. Three conditions corresponding to perfectly
premixed methane and air, Jet A-1 spray, and Jet A-1 spray in premixed methane
and air flames are examined. For all test conditions, the fuels and air flow
rates are adjusted to produce a fixed power of 10 kW. The results show that the
frequency of the spatially averaged flame chemiluminescence as well as the
number and the mass of the droplets (for both reacting and non-reacting
conditions) oscillations frequencies match; however, these frequencies do not
match that of the pressure fluctuations. This suggests that the flame
chemiluminescence dynamics is driven by the fuel injection system. For signals
with matching frequency content, a data-driven framework is developed for
predicting an objective signal (the spray number of droplets) using an input
signal (the flame chemiluminescence). The performance of the developed
framework is assessed for tested spray conditions and the predicted number of
droplets agrees well with those measured. For gas turbine engine combustion
research, the developed framework is of importance, as it facilitates
understanding the time-resolved spray characteristics for instances that the

constitutes a fundamental problem in high dimension probability that finds wide
applications in diverse fields. This paper provides a kinematic description for
the behavior of Gaussian random projections of closed convex cones, in analogy
to that of randomly rotated cones studied in [ALMT14]. Formally, let $K$ be a
closed convex cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $G\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ be a
Gaussian matrix with i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ entries. We show that $GK\equiv
\{G\mu: \mu \in K\}$ behaves like a randomly rotated cone in $\mathbb{R}^m$
with statistical dimension $\min\{\delta(K),m\}$, in the following kinematic
sense: for any fixed closed convex cone $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$, \begin{align*}
&\delta(L)+\delta(K)\ll m\, \Rightarrow\, L\cap GK = \{0\} \hbox{ with high
probability},\\ &\delta(L)+\delta(K)\gg m\, \Rightarrow\, L\cap GK \neq \{0\}
\hbox{ with high probability}. \end{align*} A similar kinematic description is
obtained for $G^{-1}L\equiv \{\mu \in \mathbb{R}^n: G\mu \in L\}$.
  The practical usefulness and broad applicability of the prescribed
approximate kinematic formulae are demonstrated in a number of distinct
problems arising from statistical learning, mathematical programming and
asymptotic geometric analysis. In particular, we prove (i) new phase
transitions of the existence of cone constrained maximum likelihood estimators
in logistic regression, (ii) new phase transitions of the cost optimum of
deterministic conic programs with random constraints, and (iii) a local version
of the Gaussian Dvoretzky-Milman theorem that describes almost deterministic,

that although the magnitude of CAPE change in high-resolution model output is

describe the distributional changes, which has a down-sloping structure and is
crucial for impact assessment. A more appropriate framework for understanding
CAPE changes uses the tight correlation between CAPE and moist static energy
(MSE) surplus. Atmospheric profiles develop appreciable CAPE only when MSE
surplus becomes positive; beyond this point, CAPE increases as $\sim$25% of the
rise in MSE surplus. Because this relationship is robust across climate states,
changes in future CAPE distributions can be well-captured by a simple scaling
of present-day data using only three parameters.

purposes, we need to approximate probability density functions through
numerical integration or series expansions. Current available approximation
methods are either too time-consuming or do not function within the range of

We demonstrate the applicability of the constructed priors on selected Bayesian
inverse problems which include the deconvolution problem, and the inversion of
a function governed by an elliptic partial differential equation. We also
demonstrate hierarchical {\alpha}-stable priors in the one-dimensional
deconvolution problem. We employ maximum-a-posterior-based estimation at all

non-smooth nature of the check loss, and the latter is sensitive to
heavy-tailed error distributions. In this paper, we propose and study
(penalized) robust expectile regression (retire), with a focus on iteratively
reweighted $\ell_1$-penalization which reduces the estimation bias from
$\ell_1$-penalization and leads to oracle properties. Theoretically, we
establish the statistical properties of the retire estimator under two regimes:
(i) low-dimensional regime in which $d \ll n$; (ii) high-dimensional regime in
which $s\ll n\ll d$ with $s$ denoting the number of significant predictors. In
the high-dimensional setting, we carefully characterize the solution path of
the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$-penalized retire estimation, adapted from
the local linear approximation algorithm for folded-concave regularization.
Under a mild minimum signal strength condition, we show that after as many as
$\log(\log d)$ iterations the final iterate enjoys the oracle convergence rate.
At each iteration, the weighted $\ell_1$-penalized convex program can be
efficiently solved by a semismooth Newton coordinate descent algorithm.
Numerical studies demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed
procedure compared with either non-robust or quantile regression based
alternatives.

promising performance, particularly in the image segmentation field. However,
it is still a very challenging task due to the limited supervision, especially
when only a small number of labeled samples are available. Additionally, almost
all existing WSL segmentation methods are designed for star-convex structures
which are very different from curvilinear structures such as vessels and
nerves. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsely annotated segmentation
framework for curvilinear structures, named YoloCurvSeg. A very essential
component of YoloCurvSeg is image synthesis. Specifically, a background
generator delivers image backgrounds that closely match the real distributions
through inpainting dilated skeletons. The extracted backgrounds are then
combined with randomly emulated curves generated by a Space Colonization
Algorithm-based foreground generator and through a multilayer patch-wise
contrastive learning synthesizer. In this way, a synthetic dataset with both
images and curve segmentation labels is obtained, at the cost of only one or a
few noisy skeleton annotations. Finally, a segmenter is trained with the
generated dataset and possibly an unlabeled dataset. The proposed YoloCurvSeg
is evaluated on four publicly available datasets (OCTA500, CORN, DRIVE and

recovers the structural features of the standard Weyl's law for the eigenvalues
of the Laplacian in compact regions. Specifically, the asymptotics of the
counting function $N(\omega)$ of quasi-normal modes of $(d+1)$-dimensional
black holes follows a power-law $N(\omega)\sim
\mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}}\omega^d$, with $\mathrm{Vol}_d^{\mathrm{eff}}$ an
effective volume determined by the light-trapping and decay properties of the
black hole geometry. Closed forms are presented for the Schwarzschild black
hole and a quasi-normal mode Weyl's law is proposed for generic black holes. As
an application, such Weyl's law could provide a probe into the effective
dimensionality of spacetime and the relevant resonant scales of actual
astrophysical black holes, upon the counting of sufficiently many overtones in
the observed ringdown signal of binary black hole mergers.

  Splitting",,,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) recently emerged as a promising tool for
analyzing and solving complex differential equations arising in science and
engineering applications. Alternative to traditional numerical schemes,
learning-based solvers utilize the representation power of DNNs to approximate
the input-output relations in an automated manner. However, the lack of
physics-in-the-loop often makes it difficult to construct a neural network
solver that simultaneously achieves high accuracy, low computational burden,
and interpretability. In this work, focusing on a class of evolutionary PDEs
characterized by having decomposable operators, we show that the classical
``operator splitting'' numerical scheme of solving these equations can be
exploited to design neural network architectures. This gives rise to a
learning-based PDE solver, which we name Deep Operator-Splitting Network
(DOSnet). Such non-black-box network design is constructed from the physical
rules and operators governing the underlying dynamics contains learnable
parameters, and is thus more flexible than the standard operator splitting
scheme. Once trained, it enables the fast solution of the same type of PDEs. To
validate the special structure inside DOSnet, we take the linear PDEs as the
benchmark and give the mathematical explanation for the weight behavior.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the advantages of our new AI-enhanced PDE solver,
we train and validate it on several types of operator-decomposable differential
equations. We also apply DOSnet to nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations (NLSE)
which have important applications in the signal processing for modern optical
fiber transmission systems, and experimental results show that our model has
better accuracy and lower computational complexity than numerical schemes and
the baseline DNNs.

single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems.
Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary
configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom
reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve
atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine
which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols
that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this
approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms nor the number of
times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that
increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this
work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve
the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration
problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total
distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of
displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is
displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a
partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time
algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We
numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and
in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation,
and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for
assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast
preparation time, as well as for designing and benchmarking novel atom
reconfiguration algorithms.

repulsive forces between agents. We consider the problem of constructing a
data-based approximation of the interacting forces directly from noisy
observations of the paths of the agents in time. The learned interaction
kernels are then used to predict the agents behavior over a longer time
interval. The approximation developed in this work uses a randomized feature
algorithm and a sparse randomized feature approach. Sparsity-promoting
regression provides a mechanism for pruning the randomly generated features
which was observed to be beneficial when one has limited data, in particular,
leading to less overfitting than other approaches. In addition, imposing
sparsity reduces the kernel evaluation cost which significantly lowers the
simulation cost for forecasting the multi-agent systems. Our method is applied
to various examples, including first-order systems with homogeneous and
heterogeneous interactions, second order homogeneous systems, and a new sheep
swarming system.

phenomena displayed by quantum systems. Interestingly, such
stronger-than-classical quantum correlations are somehow constrained, and one
important question to the foundations of quantum theory is whether there is a
physical, operational principle responsible for those constraints. One
candidate is the information causality principle, which, in some particular
cases, is proven to hold for quantum systems and to be violated by
stronger-than-quantum correlations. In multipartite scenarios, though, it is
known that the original formulation of the information causality principle
fails to detect even extremal stronger-than-quantum correlations, thus
suggesting that a genuinely multipartite formulation of the principle is
necessary. In this work, we advance towards this goal, reporting a new
formulation of the information causality principle in multipartite scenarios.
By proposing a change of perspective, we obtain multipartite informational
inequalities that work as necessary criteria for the principle to hold. We
prove that such inequalities hold for all quantum resources, and forbid some
stronger-than-quantum ones. Finally, we show that our approach can be
strengthened if multiple copies of the resource are available, or,
counter-intuitively, if noisy communication channels are employed.

clients by sharing their learned local model parameters. However, with
increasing model size, deploying federated learning requires a large
communication bandwidth, which limits its deployment in wireless networks. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce a residual-based federated learning
framework (ResFed), where residuals rather than model parameters are
transmitted in communication networks for training. In particular, we integrate
two pairs of shared predictors for the model prediction in both
server-to-client and client-to-server communication. By employing a common
prediction rule, both locally and globally updated models are always fully
recoverable in clients and the server. We highlight that the residuals only
indicate the quasi-update of a model in a single inter-round, and hence contain
more dense information and have a lower entropy than the model, comparing to
model weights and gradients. Based on this property, we further conduct lossy
compression of the residuals by sparsification and quantization and encode them
for efficient communication. The experimental evaluation shows that our ResFed
needs remarkably less communication costs and achieves better accuracy by
leveraging less sensitive residuals, compared to standard federated learning.
For instance, to train a 4.08 MB CNN model on CIFAR-10 with 10 clients under
non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) setting, our approach
achieves a compression ratio over 700X in each communication round with minimum
impact on the accuracy. To reach an accuracy of 70%, it saves around 99% of the
total communication volume from 587.61 Mb to 6.79 Mb in up-streaming and to
4.61 Mb in down-streaming on average for all clients.

leading to better performance than post-training quantization. Approximation of
gradients through the non-differentiable quantization operator is typically
achieved using the straight-through estimator (STE) or additive noise. However,
STE-based methods suffer from instability due to biased gradients, whereas
existing noise-based methods cannot reduce the resulting variance. In this
work, we incorporate exponentially decaying quantization-error-aware noise
together with a learnable scale of task loss gradient to approximate the effect
of a quantization operator. We show this method combines gradient scale and
quantization noise in a better optimized way, providing finer-grained
estimation of gradients at each weight and activation layer's quantizer bin
size. Our controlled noise also contains an implicit curvature term that could
encourage flatter minima, which we show is indeed the case in our experiments.

also capable of emitting labels that are central to the implementation of
control-flow integrity (CFI) solutions. COGENT encodes all tags and labels as

transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers when one of the constitutive
layers has a Janus structure. This has important consequences for the charge
separation efficiency. We investigate different MoS$_2$@Janus layer
combinations using first-principles methods including electron-hole
interactions (excitons) and exciton-phonon coupling. The direction of the
intrinsic electric field from the Janus layer modifies the electronic band
alignments and, consequently, the energy separation between interlayer exciton
states -- which usually have a very low oscillator strength and hence are
almost dark in absorption -- and bright in-plane excitons. We find that
in-plane lattice vibrations strongly couple the two states, so that
exciton-phonon scattering may be a viable generation mechanism for interlayer
excitons upon light absorption. In particular, in the case of MoS$_2$@WSSe, the
energy separation of the low-lying interlayer exciton from the in-plane exciton
is resonant with the transverse optical phonon modes (40 meV). We thus identify
this heterobilayer as a prime candidate for efficient electron-hole pair
generation with efficient charge carrier separation.

Using extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the existence and
stability of such travelling states in the collective dynamics of a generic

these dynamic travelling states exist only in a relatively narrow region of

$n^{2/3}$ in a graph with $n$ vertices (Mehta, Mckenzie, Trevisan 2019 and

some evidence that the information-computation trade-off of our current

only as approaches to quantum gravity but also as models for performing quantum
computation. Here we propose a Dirac gauge theory for topological spinors in
$3+1$ dimensional networks associated to an arbitrary metric. Topological
spinors are the direct sum of $0$-cochains and $1$-cochains defined on a
network and describe a matter field defined on both nodes and links of a
network. Recently in Ref. \cite{bianconi2021topological} it has been shown that
topological spinors obey the topological Dirac equation driven by the discrete
Dirac operator. In this work we extend these results by formulating the Dirac
equation on weighted and directed $3+1$ dimensional networks which allow for
the treatment of a local theory. The commutators and anti-commutators of the
Dirac operators are non vanishing an they define the curvature tensor and
magnetic field of our theory respectively. This interpretation is confirmed by
the non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation. In the
non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation the sector of the spinor
defined on links follows the Schr\""odinger equation with the correct
giromagnetic moment, while the sector of the spinor defined on nodes follows
the Klein-Gordon equation and is not negligible. The action associated to the
proposed field theory comprises of a Dirac action and a metric action. We
describe the gauge invariance of the action under both Abelian and non-Abelian
transformations and we propose the equation of motion of the field theory of
both Dirac and metric fields. This theory can be interpreted as a limiting case
of a more general gauge theory valid on any arbitrary network in the limit of
almost flat spaces.

Human-Robot Teams were often in directed autonomy mode (70% of mission time),

$M_\star$ from 120 to $200~M_\odot$, with much smaller ionized-gas masses
$M_\mathrm{ion-gas} = 0.2$ to $0.25~M_\odot$. The stellar mass is distributed
within the gravitational radius $R_g\approx 1000$ to 1500 au, where the ionized
gas is bound. The viewing inclination angle from the face-on orientation is $i
= 49$ to $56~\deg$. Radial motions at radii $r > R_g$ converge to $v_{r,0}
\approx 8.7$ km/s, or about the speed of sound of ionized gas, indicating that
this gas is marginally unbound at most. From additional constraints on the
ionizing-photon rate and far-IR luminosity of the region, we conclude that the
stellar cluster consists of a few massive stars with $M_\mathrm{star} = 32$ to
$60~M_\odot$, or one star in this range of masses accompanied by a population
of lower-mass stars. Any active accretion of ionized gas onto the massive
(proto)stars is residual. The inferred cluster density is very large,
comparable to that reported at similar scales in the Galactic Center. Stellar
interactions are likely to occur within the next Myr.

The two cross-modal tokens are input into the 3D deformable attention module to

Local joint stride attention is applied to spatially combine attention and pose

nuclei, leptons, ratios of $\bar p/p$ and B/C, and anisotropic reversal, were
observed in past years. AMS-02 experiment also revealed different spectral
break for positron and electron at 284 GeV and beyond TeV respectively. It is
natural to ask whether all those anomalies originate from one unified physical
scenario. In this work, the spatially-dependent propagation (SDP) with a nearby
SNR source is adopted to reproduce above mentioned anomalies. There possibly
exists dense molecular cloud(DMC) around SNRs and the secondary particles can
be produced by pp-collision or fragmentation between the accelerated primary
cosmic rays and DMC. As a result, the spectral hardening for primary, secondary
particles and ratios of $B/C$ and $\bar p/p$ can be well reproduced. Due to the
energy loss at source age of 330 kyrs, the characteristic spectral break-off
for primary electron is at about 1 TeV hinted from the measurements. The
secondary positron and electron from charged pion take up $5\%$ energy from
their mother particles, so the positron spectrum has a cut-off at $\sim$250
GeV. Therefore, the different spectral break for positron and electron together
with other anomalies can be fulfilled in this unified physical scenario. More
interesting is that we also obtain the featured structures as spectral
break-off at 5 TV for secondary particles of Li, Be, B, which can be served to
verify our model. We hope that those tagged structures can be observed by the
new generation of space-borne experiment HERD in future.

complete the SPT-3G 2018 $TT/TE/EE$ data set. This is the first analysis to
present cosmological constraints from SPT $TT$, $TE$, and $EE$ power spectrum

set to a series of consistency tests at the power spectrum and parameter level.
We find excellent agreement between frequencies and spectrum types and our
results are robust to the modeling of astrophysical foregrounds. We report
results for $\Lambda$CDM and a series of extensions, drawing on the following
parameters: the amplitude of the gravitational lensing effect on primary power
spectra $A_\mathrm{L}$, the effective number of neutrino species
$N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, the primordial helium abundance $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$, and the
baryon clumping factor due to primordial magnetic fields $b$. We find that the

probability-to-exceed of $15\%$. For $\Lambda$CDM, we constrain the expansion

However, traditional protection mechanisms may not be supported due to the

of electromagnetic (EM) emanations has gathered the interest of the research
community. Thus, analogous protection systems have emerged as a viable solution
e.g., for providing external, non-intrusive control-flow attestation for

to account for the implications of real-life factors, predominantly the impact
of environmental noise. In this work, we introduce a framework that integrates
singular value decomposition (SVD) along with outlier detection for discovering
malicious modifications of embedded software even under variable conditions of
noise. Our proposed framework achieves high detection accuracy i.e., above 93\%
AUC score for unknown attacks, even for extreme noise conditions i.e., -10 SNR.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this realistic limiting
factor, i.e., environmental noise, is successfully addressed in the context of
EM-based anomaly detection for embedded devices.

of motion of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system. In the absence of
variability, the second system becomes Hamilton's equations of motion of the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system (first system). Variability is introduced to
Hamilton's equations of motion of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system to take
into account inherent variations (for example, due to manufacturing processes),
giving rise to heterogeneity in its parameters. We demonstrate that a
percentage of variability smaller than a threshold can break the well-known
energy recurrence phenomenon and induce localization in the energy normal-mode
space. However, percentage of variability larger than the threshold may make
the trajectories of the second system blow up in finite time. Using a
multiple-scale expansion, we derive analytically a two normal-mode

in the second system. We also investigate the chaotic behavior of the two
systems as the percentage of variability is increased, utilising the maximum
Lyapunov exponent and Smaller Alignment Index. Our analysis shows that when
there is almost energy localization in the second system, it is more probable

of spacecraft, ultra-low orbital vehicles and plumes. By introducing a discrete
velocity space, the Boltzmann method, such as the discrete velocity method and
unified methods, can capture complex and non-equilibrium velocity distribution
functions (VDFs) and describe flow behaviors exactly. However, the extremely
steep slope and high concentration of the gas VDFs in a local particle velocity
space make it very difficult for the Boltzmann method with structured velocity
space to describe high speed flow. Therefore, the adaptive velocity space (AVS)
is required for the Boltzmann solvers to be practical in complex rarefied flow
and multi-scale flow. This paper makes two improvements to the AVS approach,
which is then incorporated into a general discrete velocity framework, such as
the unified gas-kinetic scheme. Firstly, a global velocity mesh is used to
prevent the interpolation of the VDFs at the physical interface during the
calculation of the microscopic fluxes, maintaining the program's high level of
parallelism. Secondly, rather than utilizing costly interpolation, the VDFs on
a new velocity space were reconstruction using the ``consanguinity""
relationship. In other words, a split child node's VDF is the same as its
parent's VDF, and a merged parent's VDF is the average of its children's VDFs.
Additionally, the discrete deviation of the equilibrium distribution functions
is employed to maintain the proposed method's conservation. Moreover, an
appropriate set of adaptive parameters is established to enhance the automation
of the proposed method. Finally, a number of numerical tests are carried out to
validate the proposed method.

traffic managers to take control measures and drivers to choose the optimal

adjacency matrix is a key to the success of GCNs, and it is still an open

we reformulate the spatial-temporal fusion graph adjacency matrix into a
three-way adjacency tensor. Then, we reconstructed the adjacency tensor via
Tucker decomposition, wherein more informative and global spatial-temporal
dependencies are encoded. Finally, a Spatial-temporal Synchronous Graph
Convolutional module for localized spatial-temporal correlations learning and a
Dilated Convolution module for global correlations learning are assembled to
aggregate and learn the comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies of the road

employing two phenomenological models for the $\eta'N$ scattering; one is
called coupled channels model and the other the $N(1895)$-dominance model. In
the former model, the $\eta'N$ scattering amplitude is calculated in the
unitarized coupled-channel approach involving the $\eta'N$ channel, while in
the latter model the $\eta'N$ scattering process is dominated by the $N(1895)$
resonance with the spin and parity $J^P=1/2^-$. In the \com{coupled channels
model}, one single peak of the in-medium $\eta'$ mode appears in the spectral
function and the peak position shifts to higher energies along with the
increase of the nuclear density reflecting the repulsive $\eta'N$ scattering
length of the unitarized coupled-channel amplitude. On the other hand, two
branches related to the $\eta'$ and $N(1895)$-hole modes appear in the
$N(1895)$-dominance model. In both models, the shift of the peak position and
the width in the spectral function are a few tens of MeV at the normal nuclear
density for the $\eta'$ meson at rest in the nuclear medium. Once the spatial
momentum is turned on, the peak positions in the spectral function approach the
energies without the nuclear medium effect. Particularly, in the
$N(1895)$-dominance model, the peak strength of the $N(1895)$-hole mode gets
smaller with the finite momentum and the spectral function comes to have one
single peak.

Prescription dose estimations for treating preclinical gliosarcoma models in
MRT studies at the Imaging and Medical Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron
currently rely on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The steep dose gradients
associated with the 50$\,\mu$m wide coplanar beamlets present a significant
challenge for precise MC simulation of the MRT irradiation treatment field in a
short time frame. Much research has been conducted on fast dose estimation
methods for clinically available treatments. However, such methods, including
GPU Monte Carlo implementations and machine learning (ML) models, are
unavailable for novel and emerging cancer radiation treatment options like MRT.
In this work, the successful application of a fast and accurate machine
learning dose prediction model in a retrospective preclinical MRT rodent study
is presented for the first time. The ML model predicts the peak doses in the
path of the microbeams and the valley doses between them, delivered to the
gliosarcoma in rodent patients. The predictions of the ML model show excellent
agreement with low-noise MC simulations, especially within the investigated
tumour volume. This agreement is despite the ML model being deliberately
trained with MC-calculated samples exhibiting significantly higher statistical
uncertainties. The successful use of high-noise training set data samples,
which are much faster to generate, encourages and accelerates the transfer of
the ML model to different treatment modalities for other future applications in
novel radiation cancer therapies.

model to study the efficacy of inferring geometry parameters using spatially
integrated SED fitting. Our method fits the SED model to mock photometry
produced by combining a semi-analytic model with the same SED model. Our
fitting results imply that the disk radius can be constrained, while the
inclination angle, dust disk to stellar disk radius ratio, bulge radius and
intrinsic bulge to total luminosity ratio are unconstrained, even though 21
filters from UV to FIR are used. We also study the impact of S/N, finding that
the increase of S/N (up to 80) brings limited improvements to the results. We

proved that the DRL agent outperforms the scenario-based stochastic

performed for visually assessing the action taken by the DRL agent according to

applies layers of SWAP gates simultaneously executable on the coupling map. A
good initial mapping for the swap strategy reduces the number of required swap
gates. However, even when a circuit consists of commuting gates, e.g., as in
the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) or trotterized
simulations of Ising Hamiltonians, finding a good initial mapping is a hard
problem. We present a SAT-based approach to find good initial mappings for
circuits with commuting gates transpiled to the hardware with swap strategies.
Our method achieves a 65% reduction in gate count for random three-regular

combines the SAT formulation with a clustering algorithm to reduce large
problems to a manageable size. This approach reduces the number of swap layers

variable are of primary interest, and it is natural to evaluate the effects at
different quantiles (e.g., median). The large number of potential effect
modifiers, the unknown structure of the treatment effects, and the presence of
right censoring pose significant challenges. In this paper, we develop a hybrid
forest approach called Hybrid Censored Quantile Regression Forest (HCQRF) to
assess the heterogeneous effects varying with high-dimensional variables. The
hybrid estimation approach takes advantage of the random forests and the
censored quantile regression. We propose a doubly-weighted estimation procedure
that consists of a redistribution-of-mass weight to handle censoring and an
adaptive nearest neighbor weight derived from the forest to handle
high-dimensional effect functions. We propose a variable importance
decomposition to measure the impact of a variable on the treatment effect
function. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy and stability
of HCQRF. The result of the simulation study also convinces us of the
effectiveness of the variable importance decomposition. We apply HCQRF to a
clinical trial of colorectal cancer. We achieve insightful estimations of the
treatment effect and meaningful variable importance results. The result of the
variable importance also confirms the necessity of the decomposition.

communicate a $k$-bit message $x$ to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a
channel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known
(Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine $x$
even if $\approx \frac13$ of Alice's bits are flipped adversarially. This
improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not
possible for error fractions exceeding $\frac14$.
  The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice
knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the
limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small
number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired $\epsilon >
0$, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a fraction $ 1/3-\epsilon$ of
bit flips relying only on $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback from Bob sent
in a fixed $O_\epsilon(1)$ number of rounds. We complement this with a matching
lower bound showing that $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of feedback are necessary to
recover from an error fraction exceeding $1/4$ (the threshold without any
feedback), and for schemes resilient to a fraction $1/3-\epsilon$ of bit flips,
the number of rounds must grow as $\epsilon \to 0$.
  We also study (and resolve) the question for the simpler model of erasures.
We show that $O_\epsilon(\log k)$ bits of feedback spread over $O_\epsilon(1)$
rounds suffice to tolerate a fraction $(1-\epsilon)$ of erasures. Likewise, our
$\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound applies for erasure fractions exceeding $1/2$, and
an increasing number of rounds are required as the erasure fraction approaches
$1$.

originating from Lee and Weerasinghe (2011) (see \cite{lee2011convergence}). We
employ their single server queueing model, where the state process is the

state-dependent intensity, and service times and customer's patience times are
i.i.d with general distributions. We introduce an infinite-horizon discounted
cost functional generated by two types of costs associated with the queueing
model: a control cost related to the use of control and a penalty for idleness
cost. Our major contribution lies in solving the QCP with a non-trivial cost
function for the control cost. Under mild assumptions, the heavy traffic limit
of the QCP yields a stochastic control problem described by a stochastic
differential equation, which we call a diffusion control problem (DCP). We
solve the corresponding DCP with the help of the Legendre-Fenchel

optimal control. We provide the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding
admissible control system by a comparison result. Then we ``convert"" the
optimal strategy of the DCP to the QCP of which we obtain a nearly optimal

operation is that which it absorbs from the plant. For a linear feedback law to
be feasible for a self-powered control system, its feedback signal must be
colocated with the control inputs, and its input-output mapping must satisfy an
associated passivity constraint. The imposition of such a feedback law can be
viewed equivalently as the imposition of a linear passive shunt admittance at
the actuation ports of the plant. In this paper we consider the use of
actively-controlled electronics to impose a self-powered linear feedback law.
To be feasible, it is insufficient that the imposed admittance be passive,
because parasitic losses must additionally be overcome. We derive sufficient
feasibility conditions which explicitly account for these losses. In the
finite-dimensional, time-invariant case, the feasibility condition distills to
a more conservative version of the Positive Real Lemma, which is parametrized
by various loss parameters. Three examples are given, in which this condition
is used to determine the least-efficient loss parameters necessary to realize a

masked autoencoders (MAE) can make the transformer focus more on the image

advanced CNNs models still. Therefore, we investigated how to reduce the
decoder complexity in MAE and found a more suitable architectural configuration

vision. Recently, the registration method in an evolutionary way has received
continuous attention because of its robustness to the initial pose and
flexibility in objective function design. However, most evolving registration
methods cannot tackle the local optimum well and they have rarely investigated
the success ratio, which implies the probability of not falling into local
optima and is closely related to the practicality of the algorithm.
Evolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO) is a widely used paradigm, which
can boost exploration capability through knowledge transfer among related
tasks. Inspired by this concept, this study proposes a novel evolving
registration algorithm via EMTO, where the multi-task configuration is based on
the idea of solution space cutting. Concretely, one task searching in cut space
assists another task with complex function landscape in escaping from local
optima and enhancing successful registration ratio. To reduce unnecessary
computational cost, a sparse-to-dense strategy is proposed. In addition, a
novel fitness function robust to various overlap rates as well as a
problem-specific metric of computational cost is introduced. Compared with 7
evolving registration approaches and 4 traditional registration approaches on
the object-scale and scene-scale registration datasets, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performances in terms of
precision and tackling local optima.

maximize the average power generated from stochastic disturbances. In
large-scale applications it is often advantageous to use three-phase conversion
technologies for transduction. In such situations, vector control techniques
can be used to optimally control the transducer currents in the
direct-quadrature reference frame, as dynamic functions of feedback
measurements. In this paradigm, converted energy is optimally controlled via
the quadrature current. The direct current is only used to maintain control of
the quadrature current when the machine's internal back-EMF exceeds the voltage
of the power bus, a technique called field weakening. Due to increased
dissipation in the stator coil, the use of field weakening results in a
reduction in power conversion, relative to what would theoretically be possible
with a larger bus voltage. This over-voltage issue can be alternatively
addressed by imposing a competing objective in the optimization of the
quadrature current controller, such that the frequency and duration of these
over-voltage events are reduced. However, this also results in reduced
generated power, due to the need to satisfy the competing constraint. This
paper examines the tradeoff between these two approaches to over-voltage
compensation, and illustrates a methodology for determining the optimum balance

final motions of the Restricted $3$-body Problem, that is, to provide the
qualitative description of its complete (i.e. defined for all time) orbits as
time goes to infinity. According to the classification given by Chazy back in
1922, a remarkable possible behaviour is that of oscillatory motions, where the
motion $q$ of the massless body is unbounded but returns infinitely often
inside some bounded region: \[ \limsup_{t\to\pm\infty}
|q(t)|=\infty\qquad\qquad\text{and}\qquad\qquad \liminf_{t\to\pm\infty}

classification, oscillatory motions do not occur in the $2$-body Problem, while
they do for larger numbers of bodies. A further point of interest is their
appearance in connection with the existence of chaotic dynamics.
  In this paper we introduce new tools to study the existence of oscillatory
motions and prove that oscillatory motions exist in a particular configuration
known as the Restricted Isosceles $3$-body Problem (RI3BP) for almost all

structures, self-consistent calculations involving up to $10^5$ variational
parameters are performed to investigate the vortex solutions on lattices of up
to $10^4$ sites. By taking into account the strong correlation of the model,
our calculations shed new lights on two puzzling results that have emerged from
recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. The first concerns the
issue of the zero-biased-conductance peak (ZBCP) at the vortex core for a
uniform $d$-wave superconducting state. Despite its theoretical prediction, the
ZBCP was not observed in most doping range of cuprates except in heavily
over-doped samples at low magnetic field. The second issue is the nature of the
checkerboard charge density waves (CDWs) with a period of about 8 unit cells in
the vortex halo at optimal doping. Although it has been suggested that such
bipartite structure arises from low-energy quasiparticle interference, another
intriguing scenario posits that the checkerboard CDWs originate from an
underlying bidirectional pair-density wave (PDW) ordering with the same period.
We present a coherent interpretation of these experimental results based on
systematic studies of the doping and magnetic field effects on vortex solutions
with and without a checkerboard structure. The mechanism of the emergent
intertwined orders within the vortex halo is also discussed.

homogeneous problem with an isotropic Gaussian random field on $\bS^2$ as an
initial condition. In the second stage, the model becomes an inhomogeneous
problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian motion on $\bS^2$. The solution to
the model is given in the form of an expansion in terms of complex spherical
harmonics. An approximation to the solution is given by truncating the
expansion of the solution at degree $L\geq1$. The rate of convergence of the
truncation errors as a function of $L$ and the mean square errors as a function

when the scene contains significant occlusion and/or low resolution of the
pedestrians to be detected. Existing methods are unable to adapt to these
difficult cases while maintaining acceptable performance. In this paper we
propose a novel feature learning model, referred to as CircleNet, to achieve
feature adaptation by mimicking the process humans looking at low resolution
and occluded objects: focusing on it again, at a finer scale, if the object can
not be identified clearly for the first time. CircleNet is implemented as a set
of feature pyramids and uses weight sharing path augmentation for better
feature fusion. It targets at reciprocating feature adaptation and iterative
object detection using multiple top-down and bottom-up pathways. To take full
advantage of the feature adaptation capability in CircleNet, we design an
instance decomposition training strategy to focus on detecting pedestrian
instances of various resolutions and different occlusion levels in each cycle.
Specifically, CircleNet implements feature ensemble with the idea of hard
negative boosting in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two pedestrian
detection datasets, Caltech and CityPersons, show that CircleNet improves the
performance of occluded and low-resolution pedestrians with significant margins
while maintaining good performance on normal instances.

wavelength converters whose operation is not contingent on dispersion
engineering; yet, the output wavelengths are controlled with high accuracy. In
our scheme, coherent coupling between counter-propagating waves in a photonic
crystal microresonator induces a photonic bandgap that isolates (in dispersion
space) specific wavenumbers for nonlinear gain. We first demonstrate the wide
applicability of this strategy to parametric nonlinear processes, by simulating
its use in third harmonic generation, dispersive wave formation in Kerr
microcombs, and four-wave mixing Bragg scattering. In experiments, we
demonstrate Kerr optical parametric oscillators in which such
wavenumber-selective coherent coupling designates the signal mode. As a result,
differences between the targeted and realized signal wavelengths are <0.3
percent. Moreover, leveraging the bandgap-protected wavenumber selectivity, we
continuously tune the output frequencies by nearly 300 GHz without compromising
efficiency. Our results will bring about a paradigm shift in how

gradient correction term. To deepen our understanding of the high-resolution
differential equation framework on the convergence rate, we continue to
investigate NAG for the $\mu$-strongly convex function based on the techniques

enlarges the step size to $s=1/L$ with minor modification. Meanwhile, the way
of constructing Lyapunov functions is principled. Furthermore, we also
investigate NAG from the implicit-velocity scheme. Due to the difference in the
velocity iterates, we find that the Lyapunov function is constructed from the
implicit-velocity scheme without the additional term and the calculation of
iterative difference becomes simpler. Together with the optimal step size
obtained, the high-resolution differential equation framework from the

computers. Yet resilience for MPI continues to be an issue for large-scale
computations, and especially for long-running computations that exceed the
maximum time allocated to a job by a resource manager. Transparent
checkpointing (with no modification of the underlying binary executable) is an
important component in any strategy for software resilience and chaining of
resource allocations. However, achieving low runtime overhead is critical for
community acceptance of a transparent checkpointing solution. (""Runtime
overhead"" is the overhead in time when running an application with no
checkpoints, both with and without the checkpointing package.)
  A collective-vector-clock algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI is
presented. The algorithm is built using the software of the mature MANA project
for transparent checkpointing of MPI. MANA's existing two-phase-commit
algorithm produces very high runtime overhead as compared to ""native""
execution. For example, MANA was found to result in runtime overheads as high
as 37% on some real-world programs, and up to 800% on some typical
micro-benchmarks -- especially on workloads that intensively use collective
communication. The new algorithm replaces two-phase commit. It is a novel
variation on vector clock algorithms. It uses a vector of logical clocks, with
an individual clock for each distinct group of MPI processes underlying the MPI
communicators in the application. This contrasts with the traditional vector of
logical clocks across individual processes. Micro-benchmarks show a runtime
overhead of essentially zero for many MPI processes. And two real-world
applications, VASP and GROMACS, show a runtime overhead ranging mostly from 0%
to 7% (VASP) and 1% to 14% (GROMACS) -- even before further analysis and
optimization of other sources of overhead.

However, building robot learning systems at a comparable scale remains
challenging. To develop robots that can perform a wide range of skills and
adapt to new scenarios, efficient methods for collecting vast and diverse
amounts of data on physical robot systems are required, as well as the
capability to train high-capacity policies using such datasets. In this work,
we propose a framework for scaling robot learning, with specific focus on
multi-task and multi-scene manipulation in kitchen environments, both in
simulation and in the real world. Our proposed framework, CACTI, comprises four
stages that separately handle: data collection, data augmentation, visual
representation learning, and imitation policy training, to enable scalability
in robot learning . We make use of state-of-the-art generative models as part
of the data augmentation stage, and use pre-trained out-of-domain visual
representations to improve training efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On a real robot setup, CACTI
enables efficient training of a single policy that can perform 10 manipulation
tasks involving kitchen objects, and is robust to varying layouts of
distractors. In a simulated kitchen environment, CACTI trains a single policy
to perform 18 semantic tasks across 100 layout variations for each individual
task. We will release the simulation task benchmark and augmented datasets in
both real and simulated environments to facilitate future research.

passengers stranded at disruption stations as quickly as possible. This paper
proposes a two-stage optimization model to jointly make decisions for two

are used to describe the accumulation of time-varying passenger flow. In the
second one, a system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SODTA) model is
employed to dynamically schedule response vehicles, which is able to capture
the dynamic traffic and congestion. Numerical cases of Beijing Metro Line 9
verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model, and results show
that: (1) when occurring a disruption event during peak hours, the impact on
the normal timetable is greater, and passengers in the direction with fewer
train services are more affected; (2) if passengers stranded at the terminal
stations of disruption area are not transported in time, they will rapidly
increase at a speed of more than 300 passengers per minute; (3) compared with

operations research and machine learning applications as a powerful means to
obtain solutions with favourable out-of-sample performances. Two compelling
explanations for the success are the generalization bounds derived from
Wasserstein DRO and the equivalency between Wasserstein DRO and the
regularization scheme commonly applied in machine learning. Existing results on
generalization bounds and the equivalency to regularization are largely limited
to the setting where the Wasserstein ball is of a certain type and the decision
criterion takes certain forms of an expected function. In this paper, we show
that by focusing on Wasserstein DRO problems with affine decision rules, it is
possible to obtain generalization bounds and the equivalency to regularization
in a significantly broader setting where the Wasserstein ball can be of a
general type and the decision criterion can be a general measure of risk, i.e.,
nonlinear in distributions. This allows for accommodating many important
classification, regression, and risk minimization applications that have not
been addressed to date using Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that
the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and
the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a byproduct, our regularization
results broaden considerably the class of Wasserstein DRO models that can be
solved efficiently via regularization formulations.

pedestrians are selective and decisive for detection, and is implemented as a
self-paced feature learning framework with a self-activation (SA) module and a
feature calibration (FC) module. In a new self-activated manner, FC-Net learns
features which highlight the visible parts and suppress the occluded parts of
pedestrians. The SA module estimates pedestrian activation maps by reusing
classifier weights, without any additional parameter involved, therefore
resulting in an extremely parsimony model to reinforce the semantics of
features, while the FC module calibrates the convolutional features for
adaptive pedestrian representation in both pixel-wise and region-based ways.
Experiments on CityPersons and Caltech datasets demonstrate that FC-Net
improves detection performance on occluded pedestrians up to 10% while
maintaining excellent performance on non-occluded instances.

decomposed to several density-specific sub-tasks by the DDM, which are then
solved by the regression-based experts in a Foreground Density Estimation

introduce three types of interaction strategies to unify the whole framework,

cavity are nearly ubiquitously used in fundamental research and laser
applications. While most of the laser light transmits through the cavity, in
the presence of some back-scattered light from the cavity to the laser, the
self-injection locking effect can take place, which locks the laser emission
frequency to the cavity mode of similar frequency. The self-injection locking
leads to dramatic reduction of laser linewidth and noise. Using this approach,
a common semiconductor laser locked to an ultrahigh-$Q$ microresonator can
obtain sub-hertz linewidth, on par with state-of-the-art fiber lasers.
Therefore it paves the way to manufacture high-performance semiconductor lasers
with reduced footprint and cost. Moreover, with high laser power, the optical
nonlinearity of the microresonator drastically changes the laser dynamics,
offering routes for simultaneous pulse and frequency comb generation in the
same microresonator. Particularly, integrated photonics technology, enabling
components fabricated via semiconductor CMOS process, has brought increasing
and extending interest to laser manufacturing using this method. In this
article, we present a comprehensive tutorial on analytical and numerical
methods of laser self-injection locking, as well a review of most recent
theoretical and experimental achievements.

check if the Amati relation parameters evolve with the GRBs' redshift or not.
For this, we divide the GRBs into five different redshift bins. The results

different cosmological models with the calibrated GRB data. Our results
indicate that the present quality of GRB data is not good enough to put tight

the long term evolution of virus propagation behavior on a hub-and-spoke graph
of one central node and $n$ neighbors, with edges only from the neighbors to
the hub (a $2$-level starlike graph), under a variant of the discrete-time SIS
(Suspectible Infected Suspectible) model. The behavior of this model is
governed by the interactions between the infection and cure probabilities,
along with the number $n$ of $2$-level nodes. They proved that for any $n$,
there is a critical threshold relating these rates, below which the virus dies
out, and above which the probabilistic dynamical system converges to a
non-trivial steady state (the probability of infection for each category of
node stabilizes). For $a$, the probability at any time step that an infected
node is not cured, and $b$, the probability at any time step that an infected
node infects its neighbors, the threshold for the virus to die out is $b \leq
(1-a)/\sqrt{n}$. We extend this analysis to $k$-level starlike graphs for $k
\geq 3$ (each $(k-1)$-level node has exactly $n_k$ neighbors, and the only
edges added are from the $k$-level nodes) for infection rates above and below
the critical threshold of $(1-a)/\sqrt{n_1+n_2+\dots+n_{k-1}}$. We do this by
first analyzing the dynamics of nodes on each level of a $3$-level starlike
graph, then show that the dynamics of the nodes of a $k$-level starlike graph
are similar, enabling us to reduce our analysis to just $3$ levels, using the
same methodology as the $3$-level case.

successfully train 8-bit embeddings without sacrificing prediction accuracy.

methods mostly require parallel data in the training phase. In this paper, we
propose a reference-free method based on non-parallel data from the perspective
of feature disentanglement. Pseudo Siamese Disentanglement Network (PSDN) is
proposed to disentangle the accent information from the content representation
and model the target accent. Besides, a timbre augmentation method is proposed
to enhance the ability of timbre retaining for speakers without target-accent
data. Experimental results show that the proposed system can convert the accent
of native American English speech into Indian accent with higher accentedness
(3.47) than the baseline (2.75) and input (1.19). The naturalness of converted
speech is also comparable to that of the input.

for data analysis and application. In recent years, state-of-the-art methods
are dedicated to ``scale decoupling'' and ``semantic decoupling'' strategies to
further enhance the capability of representation. However, these previous
approaches focus on either the disentangling scale or semantics but ignore
merging these two ideas in a union model, which extremely limits the
performance of cross-modal retrieval models. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Scale-Semantic Joint Decoupling Network (SSJDN) for remote
sensing image-text retrieval. Specifically, we design the Bidirectional Scale
Decoupling (BSD) module, which exploits Salience Feature Extraction (SFE) and
Salience-Guided Suppression (SGS) units to adaptively extract potential
features and suppress cumbersome features at other scales in a bidirectional
pattern to yield different scale clues. Besides, we design the Label-supervised
Semantic Decoupling (LSD) module by leveraging the category semantic labels as
prior knowledge to supervise images and texts probing significant
semantic-related information. Finally, we design a Semantic-guided Triple Loss
(STL), which adaptively generates a constant to adjust the loss function to
improve the probability of matching the same semantic image and text and
shorten the convergence time of the retrieval model. Our proposed SSJDN
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in numerical experiments conducted on
four benchmark remote sensing datasets.

(4.9 kpc) determined by GALFIT. Based on the applications of the commonly
accepted pPXF code with 636 theoretical SSP templates, the host galaxy
contribution can be well determined. Then, the emission line features of
SDSS~J1557 can be well measured after subtraction of host starlight. It is
found that the velocity offset of emission lines with respect to absorption
lines reaches $458 \pm 13$ km/s. According to the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich
(BPT) diagram, SDSS J1557 is a composite galaxy. In addition, SDSS J1557 can
well fit the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\ast}$ relation of bulges and the galaxy
merger would not change this relation. Two reasonable models (say, AGN-driven
outflow vs. dual core system) have been discussed to explain this velocity
offset. The model of AGN-driven outflow fails to interpret the systematic
redshift of emission lines and similar velocity offsets for various emission
lines in SDSS~J1557. A significant velocity offset between emission and
absorption lines might be an effective indicator of dual core system.

In the present work, we study the evolution of $\Gamma$ across the redshift for
a very large sample and perform further studies on the variation of $\Gamma$
with optical parameters using SDSS data viz. H$_{\beta}$ \& Mg II and their
luminosities. Based on analysis we find that there is no change in $\Gamma$

Self-supervised pre-training is an effective and desirable way to alleviate

become a successful self-supervised learning approach for point clouds.
However, current works mainly focus on synthetic or indoor datasets. When
applied to large-scale and sparse outdoor point clouds, they fail to yield
satisfactory results. In this work, we present BEV-MAE, a simple masked
autoencoder pre-training framework for 3D object detection on outdoor point

strategy to guide the 3D encoder learning feature representation in a BEV
perspective and avoid complex decoder design during pre-training. Besides, we
introduce a learnable point token to maintain a consistent receptive field size
of the 3D encoder with fine-tuning for masked point cloud inputs. Finally,
based on the property of outdoor point clouds, i.e., the point clouds of
distant objects are more sparse, we propose point density prediction to enable
the 3D encoder to learn location information, which is essential for object

accelerate convergence, an implicit synthetic iterative scheme is developed for
the stationary phonon BTE, in which a macroscopic moment equation is invoked
and solved iteratively coupled with the typical source iteration of the kinetic
equation. Different from previous numerical interpolation, the phonon BTE is
solved again at the cell interface along the group velocity direction within a

function. Fourier stability analysis shows that the present method could
converge faster than the source iteration method in the (near) diffusive

attention in wireless communications as potential candidate for providing the
necessary high bandwidth for demanding applications. With increasing frequency,
however, the communication link becomes more vulnerable to blockage and
pathloss increases. While both effects can be mitigated with the judicious
utilization of directional beams and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
(RISs), high directivity could potentially increase the probability of
undesired misalignment between the beam that is steered by the RIS, and the
user. It is therefore crucial to characterize and understand the stochastic
behavior of misalignment in RIS-aided THz links. In this work, beam
misalignment in RIS-aided links is studied theoretically and analytical models
are derived, the validity of which is verified through numerical calculations.
It is demonstrated that there is a distinction in the stochastic behavior of
misalignment between pointing errors that occur on the steering plane or
normally to the steering plane, with direct consequences on the link robustness
on misalignment. The analytical models capture the impact of misalignment under
these qualitatively different conditions and provide the necessary tools for

nonlinear Hamiltonians on infinite lattices at arbitrary dimension, exhibiting
linear Anderson localization. Strong arguments both mathematical and numerical,
suggest for infinite models that small amplitude wave packets may generate
stationary quasiperiodic solutions (KAM tori) almost undistinguishable from
linear wave packets. The probability of this event is non vanishing at small
enough amplitude and goes to unity at amplitude zero. Most other wave packets
(non KAM tori) are chaotic. We discuss the Arnold diffusion conjecture
(recently partially proven) and propose a modified Boltzmann statistics for
wave packets valid in generic models. The consequence is that the probability
that a chaotic wave packet spreads to zero amplitude is zero. It must always
remain focused around one or few chaotic spots which moves randomly over the
whole system and generates subdiffusion.We study a class of Ding Dong models
also generating subdiffusion where the nonlinearities are replaced by hard core
potentials. Then we prove rigorously that spreading is impossible for any

  Life Estimation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation plays a critical role in Prognostics
and Health Management (PHM). Traditional machine health maintenance systems are
often costly, requiring sufficient prior expertise, and are difficult to fit
into highly complex and changing industrial scenarios. With the widespread
deployment of sensors on industrial equipment, building the Industrial Internet
of Things (IIoT) to interconnect these devices has become an inexorable trend
in the development of the digital factory. Using the device's real-time
operational data collected by IIoT to get the estimated RUL through the RUL
prediction algorithm, the PHM system can develop proactive maintenance measures
for the device, thus, reducing maintenance costs and decreasing failure times
during operation. This paper carries out research into the remaining useful
life prediction model for multi-sensor devices in the IIoT scenario. We
investigated the mainstream RUL prediction models and summarized the basic
steps of RUL prediction modeling in this scenario. On this basis, a data-driven
approach for RUL estimation is proposed in this paper. It employs a Multi-Head
Attention Mechanism to fuse the multi-dimensional time-series data output from
multiple sensors, in which the attention on features is used to capture the
interactions between features and attention on sequences is used to learn the
weights of time steps. Then, the Long Short-Term Memory Network is applied to
learn the features of time series. We evaluate the proposed model on two
benchmark datasets (C-MAPSS and PHM08), and the results demonstrate that it
outperforms the state-of-art models. Moreover, through the interpretability of
the multi-head attention mechanism, the proposed model can provide a
preliminary explanation of engine degradation. Therefore, this approach is
promising for predictive maintenance in IIoT scenarios.

protein source for manufacturing animal feed. To maximize their production,
both the quantity and quality of their reproductive cycle, i.e. egg production
during oviposition, must be increased. In artificial environments, flies often
sit idle in cages without mating, depleting their energy reserves and resulting
in lower egg production per female.
  By controlling environmental conditions such as temperature and light inside
breeding cages, the flies may be stimulated in a way that improves egg output.
However, this stimulation increases the energy demand of the process and may
stress the flies, resulting in reduced egg production. Therefore, control must
be applied in a careful way, which requires knowledge of the egg production
cycle.
  In this work, a mathematical model describing the various fly life stages and
their transition to the egg production process is developed. Relevant factors
are identified and their effect on the fly life and egg production is
mathematically described. Parameters are identified using data from literature
and goodness of fit is evaluated. Using the model, an optimal control problem
is formulated with the goal of minimizing the energy costs and increasing the
egg production quantity. In Simulation, our approach showed 13\% higher output
in shorter time at reduced energy costs compared to a (standard) constant
setpoint approach. Optimal control could reach same amount of egg in 60~\% of

matrix computation and auto-differentiation of network parameters. It is based
on the non-interacting Fermionic formalism that relates the Matchgates by
Valiant to a physical analogy of non-interacting Fermions in one dimension as
introduced by Terhal and DiVincenzo. Given an input bit string
$\boldsymbol{x}$, NFNet computes the probability
$p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x})=\langle x|U_{\theta}^\dagger \Pi_y U_\theta
|x\rangle$ of observing the bit string $\boldsymbol{y}$, which can be a sub or
full-system measurement on the evolved quantum state
$U_{\mathbf{\theta}}|x\rangle$, where $\mathbf{\theta}$ is the set of
continuous rotation parameters, and the unitary $U_{\mathbf{\theta}}$'s
underlying Hamiltonians are not restricted to nearest-neighbor interactions. We
first review the mathematical formulation of the Matchgate to Fermionic mapping
with additional matrix decomposition derivations, and then show that on top of
the pair-wise circuit gates documented in Terhal and DiVincenzo, the Fermionic
formalism can also simulate evolutions whose Hamiltonians are sums of arbitrary
two-Fermion-mode interactions. We then document the design philosophy of NFNet,
its software structure, and demonstrate its usage in various quantum system
simulation, benchmarking, and quantum learning tasks involving 512+ qubits. As
NFNet is both an efficient large-scale quantum simulator, and a
quantum-inspired classical computing network structure, many more exciting
topics are worth exploring, such as its connection to recurrent neural

accurately predicting postoperative VA before surgery by analyzing multi-view
optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is crucially needed. Unfortunately,
due to complicated fundus conditions, determining postoperative VA remains
difficult for medical experts. Deep learning methods for this problem were
developed in recent years. Although effective, these methods still face several
issues, such as not efficiently exploring potential relations between
multi-view OCT images, neglecting the key role of clinical prior knowledge
(e.g., preoperative VA value), and using only regression-based metrics which
are lacking reference. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-token
Transformer Network (CTT-Net) for postoperative VA prediction by analyzing both
the multi-view OCT images and preoperative VA. To effectively fuse multi-view
features of OCT images, we develop cross-token attention that could restrict
redundant/unnecessary attention flow. Further, we utilize the preoperative VA
value to provide more information for postoperative VA prediction and
facilitate fusion between views. Moreover, we design an auxiliary
classification loss to improve model performance and assess VA recovery more
sufficiently, avoiding the limitation by only using the regression metrics. To
evaluate CTT-Net, we build a multi-view OCT image dataset collected from our
collaborative hospital. A set of extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our model compared to existing methods in various metrics.

particular, NIO1 was designed to keep plasma generation and beam extraction
continuously active for several hours. Since 2020 the production of negative
ions at the plasma grid (the first grid of the acceleration system) has been
enhanced by a Cs layer, deposited though active Cs evaporation in the source
volume. For the negative ion sources applied to fusion neutral beam injectors,
it is essential to keep the beam current and the fraction of co-extracted
electrons stable for at least 1 h, against the consequences of Cs sputtering
and redistribution operated by the plasma. The paper presents the latest
results of the NIO1 source, in terms of caesiation process and beam
performances during continuous (6{\div}7 h) plasma pulses. Due to the small
dimensions of the NIO1 source (20 x (diam.)10 cm), the Cs density in the volume
is high (10^15 \div 10^16 m^-3) and dominated by plasma-wall interaction. The
maximum beam current density and minimum fraction of co-extracted electrons

in line width around the loop-top or above-loop-top (ALT) region of solar

observations found the oscillation in the Doppler velocity around the ALT
region. We performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to
investigate the dynamics in the ALT region, with a particular focus on the
generation of turbulence and the excitation of the oscillatory motion. We found
a rapid growth of MHD instabilities around the upper parts of the ALT region
(arms of the magnetic tuning fork). The instabilities grow more rapidly than
the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor-type instabilities at the density interface
beneath the reconnecting current sheet. Eventually, the ALT region is filled
with turbulent flows. The arms of the magnetic tuning fork have bad-curvature
and transonic flows. Therefore, we consider that the rapidly growing
instabilities are combinations of pressure-driven and centrifugally driven
Rayleigh-Taylor-type instabilities. Despite the presence of turbulent flows,
the ALT region shows a coherent oscillation driven by the backflow of the
reconnection jet. We examine the numerical results by re-analyzing the solar
flare presented in Reeves et al. 2020. We find that the highest non-thermal
velocity is always at the uppermost visible edge of the ALT region, where
oscillations are present. This result is consistent with our models. We also
argue that the turbulent magnetic field has a significant impact on the
confinement of non-thermal electrons in the ALT region.

can be discovered by unsupervised learning, especially autoencoders, which
calculate low-dimensional embeddings of the surfaces. To study the deformation
patterns of unseen shapes by transfer learning, we want to train an autoencoder
that can analyze new surface meshes without training a new network. Here, most
state-of-the-art autoencoders cannot handle meshes of different connectivity
and therefore have limited to no generalization capacities to new meshes. Also,
reconstruction errors strongly increase in comparison to the errors for the
training shapes. To address this, we propose a novel spectral CoSMA
(Convolutional Semi-Regular Mesh Autoencoder) network. This patch-based
approach is combined with a surface-aware training. It reconstructs surfaces
not presented during training and generalizes the deformation behavior of the
surfaces' patches. The novel approach reconstructs unseen meshes from different
datasets in superior quality compared to state-of-the-art autoencoders that
have been trained on these shapes. Our transfer learning errors on unseen
shapes are 40% lower than those from models learned directly on the data.
Furthermore, baseline autoencoders detect deformation patterns of unseen mesh
sequences only for the whole shape. In contrast, due to the employed regional
patches and stable reconstruction quality, we can localize where on the
surfaces these deformation patterns manifest.

matter (SFDM), has become a popular alternative to the standard, collisionless
cold dark matter (CDM) model, due to its long-held potential to resolve the
small-scale crisis of CDM. Halos made of BEC-DM have been modelled using the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation coupled to the Poisson equation; the so-called
GPP equations of motion. These equations are based on fundamental microphysical
conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for the equations to be valid in
the first place, related to the diluteness of the DM gas and the nature of the
particle scattering model. We use these conditions in order to derive the
implications for the BEC-DM parameters, the 2-particle self-interaction
coupling strength $g$ and the particle mass $m$. We compare the derived bounds
with the constraint that results from the assumption of virial equilibrium of
the central cores of halos, deriving a relationship that connects $g$ and $m$.
We find that the GPP conditions are greatly fulfilled, for BEC-DM particle
masses of interest, if such models also obey the virial condition that turns
out to be the strongest constraint. We also derive the implications for the
elastic scattering cross section (per particle mass) in BEC-DM halos, based on
the scattering model of GPP, and find a huge range of possible values,
depending on the self-interaction regime. We put our results into context to
recent literature which predicts sub-kpc core size in BEC-DM halos.

For
example, object labels should remain constant across scales, yet model
predictions diverge in many cases. This problem gets harder for tasks where the
ground-truth labels change with the presentation scale. In image quality
assessment (IQA), downsampling attenuates impairments, e.g., blurs or
compression artifacts, which can positively affect the impression evoked in
subjective studies. To accurately predict perceptual image quality,
cross-resolution IQA methods must therefore account for resolution-dependent
errors induced by model inadequacies as well as for the perceptual label shifts
in the ground truth. We present the first study of its kind that disentangles
and examines the two issues separately via KonX, a novel, carefully crafted
cross-resolution IQA database. This paper contributes the following: 1. Through
KonX, we provide empirical evidence of label shifts caused by changes in the
presentation resolution. 2. We show that objective IQA methods have a scale
bias, which reduces their predictive performance. 3. We propose a multi-scale
and multi-column DNN architecture that improves performance over previous
state-of-the-art IQA models for this task, including recent transformers. We

estimating the spatial variation of relationships between dependent and
independent variables in geographical contexts. However, GWR suffers from the
problem that classical linear regressions, which compose the GWR model, are
more prone to be underfitting, especially for significant volume and complex
nonlinear data, causing inferior comparative performance. Nevertheless, some
advanced models, such as the decision tree and the support vector machine, can
learn features from complex data more effectively while they cannot provide
explainable quantification for the spatial variation of localized

gradient boosting weighted regression model, GWRBoost, that applies the
localized additive model and gradient boosting optimization method to alleviate
underfitting problems and retains explainable quantification capability for
spatially-varying relationships between geographically located variables.
Furthermore, we formulate the computation method of the Akaike information
score for the proposed model to conduct the comparative analysis with the
classic GWR algorithm. Simulation experiments and the empirical case study are
applied to prove the efficient performance and practical value of GWRBoost. The
results show that our proposed model can reduce the RMSE by 18.3% in parameter

Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) universe. In the present study, the
effective energy and thermostatistical quantities on a cosmological horizon are
examined to clarify the holographic-like connection between them, with a focus
on a de Sitter universe. To this end, the Helmholtz free energy on the horizon
is derived from horizon thermodynamics. The free energy is found to be
equivalent to the effective energy calculated from the Friedmann equation. This
consistency is interpreted as a kind of holographic-like connection. To examine
this connection, Padmanabhan's holographic equipartition law, which is related
to the origin of spacetime dynamics, is applied to a de Sitter universe. It is
found that the law should lead to a holographic-like connection. The
holographic-like connection is considered to be a bridge between
thermostatistical quantities on the horizon and in the bulk. For example,
cosmological equations for a flat FRW universe can be derived from horizon
thermodynamics by accepting the connection as a viable scenario. In addition, a
thermal entropy equivalent to the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy is obtained from
the Friedmann equation using the concept of a canonical ensemble in statistical
physics. The present study provides new insight into the discussion of horizon

order phase transitions (SOPT) do not. Interesting variants on the standard
classification of phase transitions occur due to the breaking of discrete
parity combined with the limitation of light cone in the early Universe. If
local effective potential signals SOPT or a cross over, breaking of discrete
parity in conjunction with the finiteness of the causal horizon leads to a
causal horizon limited second order phase transition, which results in domain
walls (DWs) separating left-like and right-like domains. Thus the putative SOPT
also gives rise to GW via decaying domain walls, testable at experiments such
as IPTA, DECIGO, and LISA. On the other hand, for the case of FOPT, we get the
usual signal from spontaneously created bubbles, but also a late forming domain
wall structure separating the two types of vacua. Thus the traditional FOPT
case gives rise to two distinct peaks in the spectrum of GW, verifiable for the
low symmetry breaking scales $10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, but beyond the reach of
currently planned experiments for a high scale $\sim10^{10}$GeV. Finally, we
point out that a version of the left-right symmetric model which separates
parity breaking from gauge symmetry breaking is also subject to domain wall
formation and amenable to GW observations.

(NMT) via Transformer from scratch, especially on small datasets usually fails
to converge. Our dedicated probing tasks show that 1) both the absolute
position and relative position information gets gradually weakened or even
vanished once it reaches the upper encoder layers, and 2) the vanishing of
absolute position information in encoder output causes the training failure of
Doc2Doc NMT. To alleviate this problem, we propose a position-aware Transformer
(P-Transformer) to enhance both the absolute and relative position information
in both self-attention and cross-attention. Specifically, we integrate absolute
positional information, i.e., position embeddings, into the query-key pairs
both in self-attention and cross-attention through a simple yet effective
addition operation. Moreover, we also integrate relative position encoding in
self-attention. The proposed P-Transformer utilizes sinusoidal position
encoding and does not require any task-specified position embedding, segment
embedding, or attention mechanism. Through the above methods, we build a
Doc2Doc NMT model with P-Transformer, which ingests the source document and
completely generates the target document in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)

propose the concept of a multiplicative operator for counts as well as several
specific instances thereof, which are then used to develop MEMs for count time

trend of increasing AGN luminosity with decreasing separation, suggesting that
mergers may have contributed in triggering more luminous AGN. Through X/mid-IR
ratio $vs$ X-ray colors, we estimated a fraction of Compton-thin AGN (with
10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $<$ N$_{\rm H} <$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) of about 80\%, while
about 16\% are Compton thick (CT, with N$_{\rm H}>$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$)
sources. These fractions of obscured sources are larger than those found in
samples of isolated AGN, confirming that pairs of AGN show higher obscuration.
This trend is further confirmed by comparing the de-reddened [O\ III] emission
with the observed X-ray luminosity. However, the derived fraction of
Compton-thick sources in this sample at early stage of merging is lower than
reported for late-merging dual-AGN samples. Comparing N$_{\rm H}$ from X-rays

absorbing material is likely associated with the torus or the Broad Line

turned out that, in the range of -0.6<[Fe/H]<+0.3, [C/Fe] shows a marginally
increasing tendency with decreasing [Fe/H] with a slight upturn around
[Fe/H]~0, [N/Fe] tends to somewhat decrease towards lower [Fe/H], and [O/Fe]

tangential discontinuities are unstable due to well known Kelvin-Helmholtz
(K-H) instability. It was recognized before that magnetic fields may stabilize
the astropauses. In this paper, we explore another mechanism to reduce the K-H
instability of the astropauses. This mechanism is a periodic change of the
stellar wind dynamic pressure. Fluctuations of the stellar wind parameters are
quite expected. For example, the Sun has an 11-year cycle of global activity
although there are also shorter periods of the solar wind fluctuations. We
performed the parametric numerical study and demonstrate that the development
of the K-H instability depends on the dimensionless parameter $\chi$ which is
the ratio of the stellar wind terminal speed and interstellar flow speed. The
larger the parameter $\chi$, the larger the fluctuations caused by the K-H
instability. It has been shown that the K-H instability is convective which
agrees with the previous linear analysis. The stabilization of the astropause
by the periodic fluctuations in the stellar wind lead is demonstrated. It is
shown that for the solar wind the most effective stabilization occurs when the
period of stellar parameter change is about 1-4 years. For the eleven year

a unitary map between the Fock spaces that makes them isomorphic. Since all the

this implies that the two quantizations lead to exactly the same physical

a specialized Pearson correlation analyzer to detect gravitational-wave (GW)
events. It turned out that the LIGO and Virgo detectors' output signals contain
a significant (-6dB) component demonstrating the properties of records of
confirmed resolved GW events. It allows us to argue that the gravitational
background is largely due to the processes of stellar masses merging. Since the
specific signal is registered by the detectors continuously, we can consider
the sub-kilohertz band gravitational background field as discovered. Our
analysis method also allows us to estimate the contribution of the
gravitational background component to the total signal energy. With its help,
it will be possible not only to provide the radio-frequency estimation of the
magnitude of gravitational disturbances but also to obtain the GW background

increasing the number of reflecting elements further enhances the error

to address the extreme label set and long text classification challenges that
are posed by automated ICD coding tasks. Methods: The Transformer-based model
PLM-ICD achieved the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ICD
coding benchmark dataset MIMIC-III. It was chosen as our baseline model to be
further optimised. XR-Transformer, the new SOTA model in the general extreme
multi-label text classification domain, and XR-LAT, a novel adaptation of the
XR-Transformer model, were also trained on the MIMIC-III dataset. XR-LAT is a
recursively trained model chain on a predefined hierarchical code tree with

shown to be very sensitive to the degree of the asymmetry whereas the scenario
of the symmetry breaking is universal and does not depend on the particular way
to introduce asymmetry, be it the non-equal populations of modes in bimodal
distribution, the delay of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model, different values of
the coupling constants, or the different noise levels for oscillators in
different distribution modes. In particular, we found that even small asymmetry
may stabilize the stationary partially synchronized state, and this may happen
even for arbitrarily large frequency difference between two distribution modes
(oscillator subgroups). This effect also results in the new type of bistability
in the system when two stationary partially synchronized states coexist: one
with large level of global synchronization and synchronization parity between
two subgroups and another with lower synchronization where the one subgroup is
dominant, having higher internal (subgroup) synchronization level and enforcing
its oscillation frequency on the second subgroup.

Abstract truncated per arxiv requirements",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas physics.atom-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ultracold dilute gases provide ideal settings for measurements of atomic
structure. Helium has an internal structure sufficiently simple to permit
highly accurate predictions of its resonances and transition rates. Precise
laser spectroscopy of helium thus yields empirical constraints on such
calculations. These are desirable in the ongoing investigations seeking to
reconcile the disagreement between independent determinations of nuclear charge
radius data in both hydrogenic and helium atoms. Either the size of these
particles are truly constant and quantum electrodynamics (QED) is flawed, or
the theory is correct and some new physics is at play at the atomic scale.
  Ultracold bose gases also serve as ideal testing ground to better understand
the physics of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and the effects of
weak interactions in condensed-matter systems. The large internal energy of
helium's metastable excited state enables the measurement of the momentum of
single atoms, providing a new lens through which to examine both
weakly-interacting and strongly-correlated systems. This feature is employed to
investigate the quantum depletion of a BEC after expansion into the far-field.
Finally, the appendix reports on early progress towards the realization of an
optical lattice trap for helium.

$\frac{r}{2}$ centered at vertices of $G$, where these balls are drawn in the
geometric realization of the graph $G$ (equipped with the shortest path

half the length of the shortest loop in $G$. For higher values of $r$, the
topology of $\mathcal{N}(G,r)$ is not well-understood. We consider the
$n$-dimensional hypercube graphs $\mathbb{I}_n$ with $2^n$ vertices. Our main
results are as follows. First, when $r=2$, we show that the \v{C}ech complex
$\mathcal{N}(\mathbb{I}_n,2)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 2-spheres

all $n\ge 1$ and $r\ge 0$, the inclusion $\mathcal{N}(\mathbb{I}_n,
r)\hookrightarrow \mathcal{N}(\mathbb{I}_n, r+2)$ is null-homotopic, providing

coefficient c > 0 depends on one coordinate y $\in$ (0, H) and is bounded but
may be discontinuous. This corresponds to the physical model of ''layered

boundary conditions are assumed. In general, for each $\epsilon$ > 0, the set
of eigenfunctions is divided into a disjoint union of three subsets : Fng
(non-guided), Fg (guided) and Fres (residual). The residual set shrinks as
$\epsilon$ $\rightarrow$ 0. The customary physical terminology of
guided/non-guided is often replaced in the mathematical literature by
concentrating/non-concentrating solutions, respectively. For guided waves, the
assumption of ''layered media'' enables us to obtain rigorous estimates of
their exponential decay away from concentration zones. The case of non-guided
waves has attracted less attention in the literature. While it is not so
closely connected to physical models, it leads to some very interesting
questions concerning oscillatory solutions and their asymptotic properties.
Classical asymptotic methods are available for c(y) $\in$ C 2 but a lesser
degree of regularity excludes such methods. The associated eigenfunctions (in
Fng) are oscillatory. However, this fact by itself does not exclude the
possibility of ''flattening out'' of the solution between two consecutive
zeros, leading to concentration in the complementary segment. Here we show it
cannot happen when c(y) is of bounded variation, by proving a ''minimal
amplitude hypothesis''. However the validity of such results when c(y) is not
of bounded variation (even if it is continuous) remains an open problem.

  Resolution",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Epileptic seizures are characterised by abnormal brain dynamics at multiple
scales, engaging single neurons, neuronal ensembles and coarse brain regions.
Key to understanding the cause of such emergent population dynamics, is
capturing the collective behaviour of neuronal activity at multiple brain
scales. In this thesis I make use of the larval zebrafish to capture single
cell neuronal activity across the whole brain during epileptic seizures.
Firstly, I make use of statistical physics methods to quantify the collective
behaviour of single neuron dynamics during epileptic seizures. Here, I
demonstrate a population mechanism through which single neuron dynamics
organise into seizures: brain dynamics deviate from a phase transition.
Secondly, I make use of single neuron network models to identify the synaptic
mechanisms that actually cause this shift to occur. Here, I show that the
density of neuronal connections in the network is key for driving generalised
seizure dynamics. Interestingly, such changes also disrupt network response
properties and flexible dynamics in brain networks, thus linking microscale
neuronal changes with emergent brain dysfunction during seizures. Thirdly, I
make use of non-linear causal inference methods to study the nature of the
underlying neuronal interactions that enable seizures to occur. Here I show
that seizures are driven by high synchrony but also by highly non-linear
interactions between neurons. Interestingly, these non-linear signatures are
filtered out at the macroscale, and therefore may represent a neuronal
signature that could be used for microscale interventional strategies. This
thesis demonstrates the utility of studying multi-scale dynamics in the larval
zebrafish, to link neuronal activity at the microscale with emergent properties
during seizures.

languages using ideograms that have complicated structures with a large number
of characters, such as Chinese. To solve this problem, few-shot font generation
and even one-shot font generation have attracted a lot of attention. However,
most existing font generation methods may still suffer from (i) large
cross-font gap challenge; (ii) subtle cross-font variation problem; and (iii)
incorrect generation of complicated characters. In this paper, we propose a
novel one-shot font generation method based on a diffusion model, named
Diff-Font, which can be stably trained on large datasets. The proposed model
aims to generate the entire font library by giving only one sample as the
reference. Specifically, a large stroke-wise dataset is constructed, and a
stroke-wise diffusion model is proposed to preserve the structure and the
completion of each generated character. To our best knowledge, the proposed
Diff-Font is the first work that developed diffusion models to handle the font
generation task. The well-trained Diff-Font is not only robust to font gap and
font variation, but also achieved promising performance on difficult character
generation. Compared to previous font generation methods, our model reaches
state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

spectral statistics (LSS) of large-dimensional sample covariance matrix when
the population covariance matrices are not uniformly bounded, which is a
nontrivial extension of the Bai-Silverstein theorem (BST) (2004). The latter
has strongly influenced the development of high-dimensional statistics,
especially in applications of random matrix theory to statistics. However, the
assumption of uniform boundedness of the population covariance matrices has
seriously limited the applications of the BST. The aim of this paper is to
remove the barriers for the applications of the BST. The new CLT, allows spiked
eigenvalues to exist, which may be bounded or tend to infinity. An important
feature of our result is that the roles of either spiked eigenvalues or the
bulk eigenvalues predominate in the CLT, depending on which variance is
nonnegligible in the summation of the variances. The CLT for LSS is then
applied to compare four linear hypothesis tests: The Wilk's likelihood ratio
test, the Lawly-Hotelling trace test, the Bartlett-Nanda-Pillai trace test, and
Roy's largest root test. We also derive and analyze their power function under

motion-conditioned methods, have limitations to solve this problem. The
action-conditioned methods generate a sequence of motion from a single action.
Hence, it cannot generate long-term motions composed of multiple actions and
transitions between actions. Meanwhile, the motion-conditioned methods generate
future motions from initial motion. The generated future motions only depend on
the past, so they are not controllable by the user's desired actions. We
present MultiAct, the first framework to generate long-term 3D human motion
from multiple action labels. MultiAct takes account of both action and motion
conditions with a unified recurrent generation system. It repetitively takes
the previous motion and action label; then, it generates a smooth transition
and the motion of the given action. As a result, MultiAct produces realistic
long-term motion controlled by the given sequence of multiple action labels.

of two factors: (i) the increase in the thermal conductivity of the crystal,
and (ii) the decrease in the temperature dependence of the refractive index. We
obtained analytical expression of the focal length of thermal lens for the pump
inside the laser crystal being a Gaussian beam. Through analysis of the laser
cavity stability, we found that in order for the relative difference between
the optimal laser cavity path lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions
to be less than 0.1%, the focal length of thermal lens should be longer than
0.5 m. Such a requirement can be met if the laser crystal is cooled to
temperatures below 100 K while being pumped at a power that is enough to
produce 100 W output. Therefore, it is very likely that an output power of 100

both enhanced asymmetric properties and intensities. They can be exploited for
optical measurements that allow enantiomeric discrimination at detection levels
greater than 6 orders of magnitude than is achieved with conventional chirally
sensitive spectroscopic methods based on circularly polarized light. The
optimal approach for exploiting nanophotonic platforms for chiral detection
would be to use spectroscopic methods that provide a local probe of changes in
the near field environment induced by the presence of chiral species. Here we
show that surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is such a local probe of
the near field environment. We have used it to achieve enantiomeric
discrimination of chiral helicoid nanoparticles deposited on left and
right-handed enantiomorphs of a chiral metafilm. Hotter electromagnetic
hotspots are created for matched combinations of helicoid and metafilms
(left-left and right-right), while mismatched combinations leads to
significantly cooler electromagnetic hotspots. This large enantiomeric
dependency on hotspot intensity is readily detected using SERS with the aid of
an achiral Raman reporter molecule. In effect we have used SERS to distinguish
between the different EM environments of the plasmonic diastereomers produced
by mixing chiral nanoparticles and metafilms. The work demonstrates that by
combining chiral nanophotonic platforms with established SERS strategies new
avenues in ultrasensitive chiral detection can be opened.

the goal of providing more context to their audiences. Unfortunately, these
labels are not applied uniformly and leave large amounts of false content
unmoderated. This paper presents LAMBRETTA, a system that automatically
identifies tweets that are candidates for soft moderation using Learning To
Rank (LTR). We run LAMBRETTA on Twitter data to moderate false claims related
to the 2020 US Election and find that it flags over 20 times more tweets than
Twitter, with only 3.93% false positives and 18.81% false negatives,
outperforming alternative state-of-the-art methods based on keyword extraction
and semantic search. Overall, LAMBRETTA assists human moderators in identifying
and flagging false information on social media.

morphological analysis algorithm, to the IllustrisTNG simulations. We find that
halos lose more than $10\%$ of their mass due to baryons, mostly to filaments
and a small portion to walls and voids. However, the mass transfer does not
significantly shift the boundaries of structures, leaving the volume fractions
of the cosmic structures largely unaffected. We quantify the effects of
baryonic feedback on the power spectrum and the probability density function
(PDF) of the density field for individual cosmic structures. For the power
spectrum, most suppression due to feedback can be accounted for by including
$M\ge10^{12}~M_\odot/h$ halos, without considering other cosmic structures.
However, when examining the PDF of the density field, we find nearly $100\%$
suppression of the emptiest regions and $10\%$-level effects (boost or
suppression) in the remaining regions of filaments, walls, and voids. Our
results indicate the importance of modeling the effects of baryons in the whole
cosmic web, not just halos, for cosmological analysis beyond two-point
statistics or field-based inferences.

frequencies. This is especially the case in large bandwidth terahertz
communication systems, due to the sudden drop in energy-efficiency of ADCs as

approaches which have received significant recent interest are i) to reduce the
number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming architectures, and ii) to
reduce the resolution of the ADCs which in turn decreases power consumption.
However, decreasing the number and resolution of ADCs leads to performance loss
-- in terms of achievable rates -- due to increased quantization error. In this

operators such as envelop detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling
and quantization at the ADCs, as a way to mitigate the aforementioned

different cavity architectures have been employed for coupling to different
TMDCs. This would mean that typically, the fabrication process flow for the
cavities will need to be modified as one moves from one TMDC to the other,
which can limit the technological progress in the field. Secondly, there has
been no discussion of the impact of fabrication imperfections in the studies on
strong coupling of these subsystems so far. In this work, we address these two
questions by optimizing a cavity with the same architecture which can couple to
the four typical TMDCs (MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$) and perform a

protocol with importance sampling, allowing us to sample from arbitrary

statistical fluctuations. We show that the simulation cost can be reduced while
achieving the same accuracy, by considering the individual simulation cost
during the sampling stage.
  Moreover, we incorporate recent work on composite channel and compute
rigorous bounds on the bias and variance, showing how to choose the number of

broad-lined active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the edge-on spiral IC4329A.
Monitoring of the optical continuum with $V-$band photometry and broad
emission-line flux variability with moderate-resolution spectroscopy allowed
emission-line light curves to be measured for H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and HeII
$\lambda 4686$. We find a time delay of $16.3^{+2.6}_{-2.3}$ days for H$\beta$,
a similar time delay of $16.0^{+4.8}_{-2.6}$ days for H$\gamma$, and an
unresolved time delay of $-0.6^{+3.9}_{-3.9}$ days for HeII. The time delay for
H$\beta$ is consistent with the predicted value from the relationship between
AGN luminosity and broad line region radius, after correction for the
$\sim2.4$mag of intrinsic extinction at 5100A. Combining the measured time
delay for H$\beta$ with the broad emission line width and an adopted value of
$\langle f \rangle = 4.8$, we find a central supermassive black hole mass of
$M_{\rm BH}=6.8^{+1.2}_{-1.1}\times10^7 M_{\rm \odot}$. Velocity-resolved time
delays were measured across the broad H$\beta$ emission-line profile and may be
consistent with an ''M''-like shape. Modeling of the full reverberation
response of H$\beta$ was able to provide only modest constraints on some
parameters, but does exhibit agreement with the black hole mass and average
time delay. The models also suggest that the AGN structure is misaligned by a
large amount from the edge-on galaxy disk. This is consistent with expectations
from the unified model of AGNs, in which broad emission lines are expected to
be visible only for AGNs that are viewed at relatively face-on inclinations.

accept-reject-based algorithms practitioners often tune them by trial and
error. Lower bounds on the convergence rate are developed in both total

Particular attention is paid to using the lower bounds to study the convergence
complexity of accept-reject-based Markov chains and to constrain the rate of
convergence for geometrically ergodic Markov chains.
  The theory is applied in several settings. For example, if the target density
concentrates with a parameter $n$ (e.g. posterior concentration, Laplace
approximations), it is demonstrated that the convergence rate of a
Metropolis-Hastings chain can tend to $1$ exponentially fast if the tuning
parameters do not depend carefully on $n$. This is demonstrated with Bayesian
logistic regression with Zellner's g-prior when the dimension and sample
increase in such a way that size $d/n \to \gamma \in (0, 1)$ and flat prior
Bayesian logistic regression as $n \to \infty$.

model performance. However, existing data augmentation techniques in natural
language understanding (NLU) may not fully capture the complexity of natural
language variations, and they can be challenging to apply to large datasets.
This paper proposes the Random Position Noise (RPN) algorithm, a novel data
augmentation technique that operates at the word vector level. RPN modifies the
word embeddings of the original text by introducing noise based on the existing
values of selected word vectors, allowing for more fine-grained modifications
and better capturing natural language variations. Unlike traditional data
augmentation methods, RPN does not require gradients in the computational graph
during virtual sample updates, making it simpler to apply to large datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that RPN consistently outperforms existing
data augmentation techniques across various NLU tasks, including sentiment
analysis, natural language inference, and paraphrase detection. Moreover, RPN
performs well in low-resource settings and is applicable to any model featuring
a word embeddings layer. The proposed RPN algorithm is a promising approach for
enhancing NLU performance and addressing the challenges associated with
traditional data augmentation techniques in large-scale NLU tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrated that the RPN algorithm achieved
state-of-the-art performance in all seven NLU tasks, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and potential for real-world NLU applications.

system operators cope with their associated variability and uncertainty. The
inherent flexibility of dispathchable assets present in power systems, which is
often ill-characterized, is essential in addressing this challenge. Several
proposals for explicit flexibility characterization focus on defining a
feasible region that secures operations either in generation or uncertainty
spaces. The main drawback of these approaches is the difficulty in visualizing
this feasibility region when there are multiple uncertain parameters. Moreover,
these approaches focus on system operational constraints and often neglect the
impact of inherent couplings (e.g., spatial correlation) of renewable
generation and demand variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel data-driven inverse optimization framework for flexibility
characterization of power systems in the demand space along with its geometric
intuition. The approach captures the spatial correlation of multi-site
renewable generation and load using polyhedral uncertainty sets. Moreover, the
framework projects the uncertainty on the feasibility region of power systems
in the demand space, which are also called loadability sets. The proposed
inverse optimization scheme, recast as a linear optimization problem, is used
to infer system flexibility adequacy from loadability sets.

the time-dependence of the six inter-spacecraft light-travel-times have to be
accounted for. In the case of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a

prompt learning, we first establish a training pipeline that delivers
competitive accuracy when only 0.05% (fewer than 100) of the training data is
labeled and the remaining is unlabeled. To instantiate the workflow, we further
present a system FFNLP, addressing the high execution cost with novel designs.
(1) Curriculum pacing, which injects pseudo labels to the training workflow at
a rate commensurate to the learning progress; (2) Representational diversity, a
mechanism for selecting the most learnable data, only for which pseudo labels

for variable selection, Lasso, ElasticNet, Boruta, and GBR (Gradient Boosting

the lowest MAE (Minimum Absolute Errors) value. A comparison of seven models

select the best model were the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean

Murphy diagrams. The best individual model was found to be the GPR. The best
forecast combination was AQRA ((AQR Averaging) based on MAE. However, based on
RMSE, GPNN was the best forecast combination method. Companies such as Eskom
could use the methods adopted in this study to control and manage the power

  arXiv:2201.12277",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We consider an energy harvesting (EH) IoT network, where users make on-demand
requests to a cache-enabled edge node to send status updates about various
random processes, each monitored by an EH sensor. The edge node serves users'
requests by either commanding the corresponding sensor to send a fresh status
update or retrieving the most recently received measurement from the cache. We
aim to find a control policy at the edge node that minimizes the average
on-demand AoI over all sensors subject to per-slot transmission and energy
constraints under partial battery knowledge at the edge node. Namely, the
limited radio resources (e.g., bandwidth) causes that only a limited number of
sensors can send status updates at each time slot (i.e., per-slot transmission
constraint) and the scarcity of energy for the EH sensors imposes an energy
constraint. Besides, the edge node is informed of the sensors' battery levels
only via received status update packets, leading to uncertainty about the
battery levels for the decision-making.We develop a low-complexity algorithm --
termed relax-then-truncate -- and prove that it is asymptotically optimal as
the number of sensors goes to infinity. Numerical results illustrate that the
proposed method achieves significant gains over a request-aware greedy policy
and show that it has near-optimal performance even for moderate numbers of
sensors.

firmly established by astronomical observations as well as laboratory

emitters should contribute to the astronomical IR spectra or there exist
unknown physical processes besides thermal and UV excitation. Fullerene-based
molecules such as metallofullerenes and fullerene-adducts are natural candidate
species as potential additional emitters, but no specific species has been
identified to date. Here we report a model based on quantum-chemistry
calculations and IR spectra simulation of neutral and charged endo(exo)hedral
metallofullerenes, showing that they have a significant contribution to the
four strongest IR bands commonly attributed to neutral C60. These simulations
may explain the large range of 17.4um/18.9um band ratios observed in very
different fullerene-rich circumstellar environments like those around planetary

underlying 3D dark matter density for the first time at $z=2-2.5$, in which the
underlying matter density is reconstructed from galaxy and Ly$\alpha$ forest
spectroscopy through dynamical forward modeling techniques. Utilizing these
maps, we investigate the dependence of the star formation activities and galaxy
types (mergers, submillimeter galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quiescent
galaxies) on the matter overdensity $\Delta$ and stellar mass. For the first
time, we are able to probe underdense regions ($\Delta <1$) in addition to
overdensities. We find that star formation activity generally depend on the
stellar mass, not the matter density, except for high-mass galaxies
($M_*\geq10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) which show a drop in star formation activities
by a factor of more than $30$ if they reside in high density regions with
$\Delta\geq4-6$. We also find: (1) an absence of mergers and submillimeter
galaxies in higher-density regions but otherwise no trend across lower-density
bins, (2) the increase of active galactic nuclei and quiescent galaxy
prevalence as a function of matter density, and (3) the increase of all
aforementioned categories with the stellar mass. These results indicate that
mass is the main driver of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, we also find evidence
for environmental quenching, particularly for high-mass galaxies in
high-density environments. Our novel approach directly using reconstructed dark

a first analysis of a new catalog of optical observations of linearly polarized
starlight in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), the Interstellar

focusing on 38 fields sampling lines of sight in the diffuse medium. The fields
are about 0.3$^{\circ}$ by 0.3$^{\circ}$ in size and each of them contains
$\sim1000$ stars on average. The IPS-GI catalog has polarimetric measurements
of over 40000 stars, over 18000 of which have ${P}/\sigma_{P} > 5$. We added
distances and other parameters from auxiliary catalogs to over 36000 of these

of a high-quality subsample of 10516 stars (i.e. $\sim275$ stars per field). As
expected, the degree of polarization tends to increase with the extinction,
producing higher values of polarization at greater distances or at lower

building more accurate classifiers. We unify these dual roles by training a
single auxiliary meta-network to output an importance weight as a function of
the instance. This measure is used at train time to reweight training data, and
at test-time to rank test instances for selective classification. A second, key
component of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing dropout variance
(the variance of classifier output when subjected to random weight dropout) for
training the metanetwork. We train the classifier together with its metanetwork
using a nested objective of minimizing classifier loss on training data and
meta-loss on a separate meta-training dataset. We outperform current
state-of-the-art on selective classification by substantial margins--for
instance, upto 1.9% AUC and 2% accuracy on a real-world diabetic retinopathy

the case with well-known model-agnostic explanation approaches, and it is also

intrinsic interpretability, which does not exhibit the drawback of unsoundness.
Unfortunately, intrinsic interpretability can display unwieldy explanation
redundancy. Formal explainability represents the alternative to these
non-rigorous approaches, with one example being PI-explanations. Unfortunately,
PI-explanations also exhibit important drawbacks, the most visible of which is
arguably their size. Recently, it has been observed that the (absolute) rigor
of PI-explanations can be traded off for a smaller explanation size, by
computing the so-called relevant sets. Given some positive {\delta}, a set S of
features is {\delta}-relevant if, when the features in S are fixed, the
probability of getting the target class exceeds {\delta}. However, even for
very simple classifiers, the complexity of computing relevant sets of features
is prohibitive, with the decision problem being NPPP-complete for circuit-based
classifiers. In contrast with earlier negative results, this paper investigates
practical approaches for computing relevant sets for a number of widely used
classifiers that include Decision Trees (DTs), Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs),
and several families of classifiers obtained from propositional languages.
Moreover, the paper shows that, in practice, and for these families of
classifiers, relevant sets are easy to compute. Furthermore, the experiments
confirm that succinct sets of relevant features can be obtained for the
families of classifiers considered.

dynamic state diagram of 1,4-polybutadiene star-linear polymer mixtures was
determined with the help of linear viscoelastic and small angle X-ray
scattering experiments. While keeping the star polymers below their nominal
overlap concentration, a gel was formed upon increasing the linear polymer
content. Further addition of linear chains yielded a re-entrant liquid. This
unexpected behavior was rationalized by the interplay of three possible
phenomena: (i) depletion interactions, driven by the size disparity between the
stars and the polymer length scale which is the mesh size of this entanglement
network; (ii) colloidal deswelling due to the increased osmotic pressure
exerted onto the stars; and (iii) a concomitant progressive suppression of
depletion efficiency on increasing polymer concentration due to reduced mesh

model up to two of those jointly, or rely on heavily parametric approaches.
Building on recent Dirichlet-Point processes literature, we introduce the
Houston (Hidden Online User-Topic Network) model, that jointly considers all
those features in a non-parametric unsupervised framework. It infers dynamic
topic-dependent underlying diffusion networks in a continuous-time setting
along with said topics. It is unsupervised; it considers an unlabeled stream of
triplets shaped as \textit{(time of publication, information's content,
spreading entity)} as input data. Online inference is conducted using a
sequential Monte-Carlo algorithm that scales linearly with the size of the
dataset. Our approach yields consequent improvements over existing baselines on
both cluster recovery and subnetworks inference tasks.

challenges for agriculture. This project aims to forecast soil moisture using
domain knowledge and machine learning for crop management decisions that enable
sustainable farming. Traditional methods for predicting hydrological response
features require significant computational time and expertise. Recent work has
implemented machine learning models as a tool for forecasting hydrological
response features, but these models neglect a crucial component of traditional
hydrological modeling that spatially close units can have vastly different
hydrological responses. In traditional hydrological modeling, units with
similar hydrological properties are grouped together and share model parameters
regardless of their spatial proximity. Inspired by this domain knowledge, we
have constructed a novel domain-inspired temporal graph convolution neural
network. Our approach involves clustering units based on time-varying
hydrological properties, constructing graph topologies for each cluster, and
forecasting soil moisture using graph convolutions and a gated recurrent neural
network. We have trained, validated, and tested our method on field-scale time
series data consisting of approximately 99,000 hydrological response units
spanning 40 years in a case study in northeastern United States. Comparison
with existing models illustrates the effectiveness of using domain-inspired
clustering with time series graph neural networks. The framework is being
deployed as part of a pro bono social impact program. The trained models are
being deployed on small-holding farms in central Texas.

theoretical underpinnings of AI model utilization measurement and understanding
patterns in utilization-based class encodings of traffic signs at the level of
computation graphs (AI models), subgraphs, and graph nodes. Conceptually,
utilization is defined at each graph node (computation unit) of an AI model
based on the number and distribution of unique outputs in the space of all
possible outputs (tensor-states). In this work, utilization measurements are
extracted from AI models, which include poisoned and clean AI models. In
contrast to clean AI models, the poisoned AI models were trained with traffic
sign images containing systematic, physically realizable, traffic sign
modifications (i.e., triggers) to change a correct class label to another label
in a presence of such a trigger. We analyze class encodings of such clean and

drives elastic uplift rates of up to 20 mm/yr. We explore, for the first time,
the viability of using elastic deformation observed in the ANET GNSS network to
constrain ice mass changes in Antarctica. We begin by estimating which regions
of ice mass loss contribute to the elastic deformation observed at each ANET
GNSS site. This is done using an observer-centric model of elastic deformation,
which we call a Load Sensitivity Kernel (LSK). Using this approach, we find
that the elastic deformation at the majority of ANET sites is dominated by
far-field mass change. Over 70% of ANET sites require ice mass change within a
radius of 200km or greater to be included before 90% of the site's elastic
deformation is recovered. We show that the difference between LSKs of a pair of
neighboring GNSS receivers can be used to localize the near-field mass change
responsible for the differential displacement. Finally, we generalize this in a
novel approach that uses an arbitrary number of GNSS sites. In this approach,
LSKs of each site are weighted and added in a linear series. These weights are
optimized such that the elastic deformation from mass change outside a Region
of Interest is minimized. We demonstrate that 7 ANET GNSS sites in the Amundsen
Sea region can isolate the elastic deformation, in both the vertical and
horizontal components, that results exclusively from PIG's mass loss and/or the
losses of the PSK glaciers. With the current GNSS receiver distribution, the
east component of elastic deformation due to mass change at Thwaites can be
expressed relative to mass changes at PSK. Our results demonstrate that the
current ANET configuration can use elastic deformation to constrain ice mass
changes in Antarctica, especially in regions with relatively dense clusters of
GNSS.

Goos-H\""{a}nchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, has been attracting widespread
interest. The current research on the anomalous spatial shift in interface
electronic reflection is based on the paradigm of linear approximation, under
which the center position of the incident and reflected beams are obtained by
expanding the phases of relevant basis states and scattering amplitudes to the
first order of incident momentum. However, in a class of normal cases, the
linear approximation can lead to a divergent spatial shift in reflection for
certain incident angles even though the corresponding reflection possibility is
finite. In this work, we show that such non-physical results are caused by an
abrupt change in the number of the propagating states at critical parameters,
and can be resolved by calculating the center positions of the scattering beams
beyond the linear approximation. Moreover, we find that the beam width has an
important influence on the spatial shift near the critical angles. We
demonstrate our idea via concrete calculations of Goos-H\""{a}nchen and
Imbert-Fedorov shift on two representative models. These results are beneficial
for clarifying the scope of application of the linear approximation in the

  industrial edge device","The first four authors have equal contribution",,,,"eess.SP cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Tool flank wear monitoring can minimize machining downtime costs while
increasing productivity and product quality. In some industrial applications,
only a limited level of tool wear is allowed to attain necessary tolerances. It
may become challenging to monitor a limited level of tool wear in the data
collected from the machine due to the other components, such as the flexible
vibrations of the machine, dominating the measurement signals. In this study, a
tool wear monitoring technique to predict limited levels of tool wear from the
spindle motor current and dynamometer measurements is presented. High-frequency
spindle motor current data is collected with an industrial edge device while
the cutting forces and torque are measured with a rotary dynamometer in
drilling tests for a selected number of holes. Feature engineering is conducted
to identify the statistical features of the measurement signals that are most
sensitive to small changes in tool wear. A neural network based on the long
short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is developed to predict tool flank wear
from the measured spindle motor current and dynamometer signals. It is
demonstrated that the proposed technique predicts tool flank wear with good
accuracy and high computational efficiency. The proposed technique can easily
be implemented in an industrial edge device as a real-time predictive
maintenance application to minimize the costs due to manufacturing downtime and
tool underuse or overuse.

  Self-knowledge Distillation and Selective Batch Sampling","Submitted to 2023 11th IEEE International Winter Conference on
  Brain-Computer Interface",,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a Siamese sleep transformer (SST) that effectively
extracts features from single-channel raw electroencephalogram signals for
robust sleep stage scoring. Despite the significant advances in sleep stage
scoring in the last few years, most of them mainly focused on the increment of
model performance. However, other problems still exist: the bias of labels in
datasets and the instability of model performance by repetitive training. To
alleviate these problems, we propose the SST, a novel sleep stage scoring model
with a selective batch sampling strategy and self-knowledge distillation. To
evaluate how robust the model was to the bias of labels, we used different
datasets for training and testing: the sleep heart health study and the
Sleep-EDF datasets. In this condition, the SST showed competitive performance
in sleep stage scoring. In addition, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the
selective batch sampling strategy with a reduction of the standard deviation of
performance by repetitive training. These results could show that SST extracted
effective learning features against the bias of labels in datasets, and the
selective batch sampling strategy worked for the model robustness in training.

setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches.
We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and

the excitement, blockchain has not been adopted in many fields. Many are
hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to privacy concerns, barriers to
use, or lack of practical use cases. In this work, we outline a potential
blockchain use case for tracking financial transactions across multiple
financial institutions. We show the downsides of traditional centralized
approaches and that blockchain approaches fail to give all the privacy and
accessibility required for this use case. Thus we propose a novel blockchain
architecture to support our use case. This novel architecture combines the ease
of use of public blockchains with the privacy of private blockchains by
allowing users to create personal blockchains. We believe this novel personal
blockchain architecture will lead to more blockchain adoption, particularly in
use cases handling private data.

  congress) to sub-groups (states, etc) and provide a novel theory that has
  with no such bias",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Proportional representation (PR) has long been believed the ideal system for
the equality of individuals in apportioning the seats of a legislature body to
subgroups. We observe that PR implicitly assumes the (standard) number of
representatives is proportional to the population, a situation no longer
observed since 1820s. To address this issue, we suggest to formulate the
apportionment problem in a broader context by explicitly specifying a standard
function $f$ such that $f(p)$ is the standard, possibly fractional number of
representatives for population $p$, where PR assumes $f(p)\propto p$. For this
generalized apportionment problem, we give a population seat index (PSI)
$\frac{f^{-1}(s)}{p}$ for quantifying the contribution of an individual in
assigning $s$ seats to a population $p$, where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.
With the PSI, we derive apportioning schemes with absolute and relative
individual equality. Particularly, for $s$ seats, populations $p_1, \ldots,
p_k$, and a standard function $f(p) = a + b p^\gamma$ with constants $a, b,
\gamma \ge 0$, the ideal, possibly fractional number of seats for subgroup $i$
is $a + \frac{(S-ka)p_i^{\gamma}}{\sum p_j^{\gamma}}$, not $\frac{Sp_i}{\sum
p_j}$ calculated by PR which works only for $a=0$, $\gamma=1$. Finally, since
real-world observations indicate a standard function $f \propto p^\gamma$ with
$\gamma < 1$, we conclude that PR represents individuals in less populous
subgroups less than individuals in more populous subgroups.

  doctoral thesis, published in October 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recently, we have been witnesses of accidents involving autonomous vehicles
and their lack of sufficient information. One way to tackle this issue is to
benefit from the perception of different view points, namely cooperative
perception. We propose here a decentralized collaboration, i.e. peer-to-peer,
in which the agents are active in their quest for full perception by asking for
specific areas in their surroundings on which they would like to know more.
Ultimately, we want to optimize a trade-off between the maximization of
knowledge about moving objects and the minimization of the total volume of
information received from others, to limit communication costs and message
processing time. For this, we propose a way to learn a communication policy
that reverses the usual communication paradigm by only requesting from other
vehicles what is unknown to the ego-vehicle, instead of filtering on the sender
side. We tested three different generative models to be taken as base for a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, and compared them to a
broadcasting policy and a policy randomly selecting areas. In particular, we
propose Locally Predictable VAE (LP-VAE), which appears to be producing better
belief states for predictions than state-of-the-art models, both as a
standalone model and in the context of DRL. Experiments were conducted in the
driving simulator CARLA. Our best models reached on average a gain of 25% of
the total complementary information, while only requesting about 5% of the
ego-vehicle's perceptual field. This trade-off is adjustable through the
interpretable hyperparameters of our reward function.

channel gains in the far-field regions and learns the optimal phase-shifts in
presence of noise in the received signals. We prove that the probability that
the optimal phase-shifts estimated by our proposed algorithm deviate from the
true values decays exponentially in the number of pilot signals. Extensive
numerical simulations validate the theoretical guarantees and also demonstrate
significant gains as compared to the state-of-the-art policies.
