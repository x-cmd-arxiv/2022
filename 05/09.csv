psychological effects in a polluted environment. We divide the single
population into two stages of larval and adult structure. The model uses
Logistic input, and the larvae are converted into adult bodies by constant
ratio. We only consider adulthood. The role of psychological effects makes the
contact between adult and environmental toxins a functional form, while the
contact between larvae and environmental toxins is linear.
  For the deterministic model embodied as a nonlinear time-varying system, we
discuss the asymptotic stability of the system by Lyapunov one-time
approximation theory, and give a sufficient condition for stability to be
established.
  Considering that the contact rate between biological and environmental toxins
in nature is not always constant, we make the contact rate interfere with white
noise, and then modify the contact rate into a stochastic process, thus
establishing a corresponding random single-population model. According to It\^o
formula and Lyapunov in the function method, we first prove the existence of
globally unique positive solutions for stochastic models under arbitrary
initial conditions, and then give sufficient conditions for weak average
long-term survival and random long-term survival for single populations in the
expected sense.

sites for the synthesis of $\textit{r}$-process elements found in stars and
planets. However, mergers can take place at significant offsets from their host
galaxies, with many occurring several kpc from star-forming regions. It is thus
important to understand the physical mechanisms involved in transporting
enriched material from merger sites in the galactic halo to the star-forming
disk. We investigate these processes, starting from an explosive injection
event and its interaction with the halo medium. We show that the total outflow
mass in compact binary mergers is too low for the material to travel to the
disk in a ballistic fashion. Instead, the enriched ejecta is swept into a
shell, which decelerates over $\lesssim 10$ pc scales and becomes corrugated by
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The corrugated shell is denser than the
ambient medium, and breaks into clouds which sink toward the disk. These
sinking clouds lose thermal energy through radiative cooling, and are also
ablated by shearing instabilities. We present a dynamical heuristic that models
these effects to predict the delay times for delivery to the disk. However, we
find that turbulent mass ablation is extremely efficient, and leads to the
total fragmentation of sinking $\textit{r}$-process clouds over $10-100$ pc
scales. We thus predict that enriched material from halo injection events
quickly assimilates into the gas medium of the halo, and that enriched mass
flow to the disk could only be accomplished through turbulent diffusion or
large-scale inflowing mass currents.

FedRR, this method was recently shown to be applicable to federated learning

taming the variance due to compression. The variance reduction mechanism for
compression allows us to eliminate dependence on the compression parameter, and
applying additional controlled linear perturbations for Random Reshuffling,
introduced by Malinovsky et al.(2021) helps to eliminate variance at the

scale \ac{iot} networks.} However, a sufficiently powerful attacker may be able
to learn the channel hopping pattern and efficiently predict the channel to
jam. In this paper, we present FOLPETTI, a MAB-based attack to dynamically
follow the victim's channel selection in real-time. Compared to previous
attacks implemented via DRL, FOLPETTI does not require recurrent training
phases to capture the victim's behavior, allowing hence a continuous attack. We
assess the validity of FOLPETTI by implementing it to launch a jamming attack.
We evaluate its performance against a victim performing random channel
selection and a victim implementing a MAB defence strategy. We assume that the
victim detects an attack when more than $20\%$ of the transmitted packets are
not received, therefore this represents the limit for the attack to be
stealthy. In this scenario, FOLPETTI achieves a $15\%$ success rate for the
victim's random channel selection strategy, close to the $17.5\%$ obtained with
a genie-aided approach. Conversely, the DRL-based approach reaches a success
rate of $12.5\%$, which is $5.5\%$ less than FOLPETTI. We also confirm the
results by confronting FOLPETTI with a MAB based channel hopping method.
Finally, we show that FOLPETTI creates an additional energy demand
independently from its success rate, therefore decreasing the lifetime of IoT
devices.

The calculated numbers of Weyl points (WPs) is estimated to be 56, 24 and 54
for SnS, SnSe and SnTe, respectively. These WPs have shown conserved Chiral
charges for all corresponding materials. The surface local density of states is
computed for these compounds, where the surface arc is clearly seen. In case of
SnS, the surface arc is found at 2.0 - 2.2 THz energy region. Also, the
isofrequency surface states are investigated to observe the presence of Fermi
arc for SnX (X = S, Se, Te). The present first-principles calculation predicts
that SnS, SnSe and SnTe show type-II Weyl phononic behaviour along with
evidence of topological phononic surface states.

  Taking into consideration the idea of code as law, we discuss accountability

on this analysis, we make the case for transparency enhancing technologies as

keeping society functional, owing to the responsiveness and availability

domain-specific and contextual processing of intents for abstracted management

mission critical (MC) services in beyond B5G networks, as well as a processing

simulation results show that MC PTT services adhere to the key performance
indicators of access time and mouth-to-ear latency bounded by approximately 250

that it is akin to a continuous-space version of the classical Eden growth
model, while being associated to a dual process encoding ancestry and allowing
one to study the evolution of the genetic diversity in such a population.
  In this article, we focus on the growth properties of the infinite-parent
SLFV in two dimensions. To do so, we first define the quantity that we shall
use to quantify the speed of growth of the area covered with the subpopulation
of real individuals. Using the associated dual process and a comparison with a
first-passage percolation problem, we show that the growth of the ""occupied""
region in the infinite-parent SLFV is linear in time. We use numerical
simulations to approximate the growth speed, and conjecture that the actual
speed is higher than the speed expected from simple first-moment calculations
due to the characteristic front dynamics.
  We then study a toy model of two interacting growing piles of cubes in order
to understand how the growth dynamics at the front edge can increase the global
growth speed of the ""occupied"" region. We obtain an explicit formula for this
speed of growth in our toy model, using the invariant distribution of a

provides guidance by providing an overall center-of-mass trajectory to imitate,
as well as for the timing of the holds. Lastly, the simplified model can also
readily be used for planning suitable sequences of handholds in a given
environment. Our results demonstrate brachiation motions with a variety of
durations for the flight and hold phases, as well as emergent extra
back-and-forth swings when this proves useful. The system is evaluated with a
variety of ablations. The method enables future work towards more general 3D
brachiation, as well as using simplified model imitation in other settings.

polaritonic devices remain operational at ambient conditions and therefore have
greater potential for practical nanophotonic applications. Here we present the
study of the nonlinear properties of Ta$_2$O$_5$ slab waveguide coupled to a
WSe$_2$ monolayer. We first confirm that the hybridization between waveguide
photon mode and a 2D semiconductor exciton resonance gives rise to the
formation of exciton-polaritons with Rabi splitting of 36 meV. By measuring
transmission of ultrashort optical pulses through this TMD-based polaritonic
waveguide, we demonstrate for the first time the strong nonlinear dependence of
the output spectrum on the input pulse energy. Our theoretical model provides
semi-quantitative agreement with experiment and gives insights into the
dominating microscopic processes which determine the nonlinear pulse
self-action: Coulomb inter-particle interaction and scattering to incoherent
excitonic reservoir. We also confirm that at intermediate pump energies the
system supports quasi-stationary solitonic regime of pulse propagation. Our
results are essential for the development of nonlinear on-chip polaritonic

manual effort from domain experts. In this work, we develop techniques that

this, we propose to perform NAS in an abstract search space of program

significantly smaller than the original search space, and (2) architectures

the mutations are guided by the program properties. Starting with a ResNet-34

future violations for as long as possible. Such a property is of fundamental
importance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and yet, to date, there is no
widely agreed-upon formal treatment of CPS resiliency. We present an STL-based
framework for reasoning about resiliency in CPS in which resiliency has a
syntactic characterization in the form of an STL-based Resiliency Specification
(SRS). Given an arbitrary STL formula $\varphi$, time bounds $\alpha$ and
$\beta$, the SRS of $\varphi$, $R_{\alpha,\beta}(\varphi)$, is the STL formula
$\neg\varphi\mathbf{U}_{[0,\alpha]}\mathbf{G}_{[0,\beta)}\varphi$, specifying
that recovery from a violation of $\varphi$ occur within time $\alpha$
(recoverability), and subsequently that $\varphi$ be maintained for duration
$\beta$ (durability). These $R$-expressions, which are atoms in our SRS logic,
can be combined using STL operators, allowing one to express composite
resiliency specifications, e.g., multiple SRSs must hold simultaneously, or the
system must eventually be resilient. We define a quantitative semantics for
SRSs in the form of a Resilience Satisfaction Value (ReSV) function $r$ and
prove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. STL's Boolean semantics. The
$r$-value for $R_{\alpha,\beta}(\varphi)$ atoms is a singleton set containing a
pair quantifying recoverability and durability. The $r$-value for a composite
SRS formula results in a set of non-dominated recoverability-durability pairs,
given that the ReSVs of subformulas might not be directly comparable (e.g., one
subformula has superior durability but worse recoverability than another). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-dimensional quantitative
semantics for an STL-based logic. Two case studies demonstrate the practical
utility of our approach.

communication, games and the metaverse, and it is therefore critical that they
be inclusive. This requires accurate recovery of the appearance, represented by
albedo, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. While significant progress has
been made on estimating 3D facial geometry, albedo estimation has received less
attention. The task is fundamentally ambiguous because the observed color is a
function of albedo and lighting, both of which are unknown. We find that
current methods are biased towards light skin tones due to (1) strongly biased
priors that prefer lighter pigmentation and (2) algorithmic solutions that
disregard the light/albedo ambiguity. To address this, we propose a new
evaluation dataset (FAIR) and an algorithm (TRUST) to improve albedo estimation
and, hence, fairness. Specifically, we create the first facial albedo
evaluation benchmark where subjects are balanced in terms of skin color, and
measure accuracy using the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) metric. We then
address the light/albedo ambiguity by building on a key observation: the image
of the full scene -- as opposed to a cropped image of the face -- contains
important information about lighting that can be used for disambiguation. TRUST
regresses facial albedo by conditioning both on the face region and a global
illumination signal obtained from the scene image. Our experimental results
show significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods on albedo
estimation, both in terms of accuracy and fairness. The evaluation benchmark

perturbative approach remained regardless of numerous inquiries. In the current
work, a typical mean field theory procedure transforms a strong coupling
Hamiltonian into a weak one, which can be solved within a perturbative
approach. The Hamiltonian of 2-dimensional free electron gas with Hubbard
on-site interaction is calculated as a test of the new procedure. Consequently,
the spectral characteristics of the cuprates peak-dip-hump are reproduced. The
result is compared with the past theoretical investigations, e.g., quantum
Monte Carlo method, density matrix renormalization group, tensor network
methods, etc., which agree well with the spectral curve.

challenging to collect data that is sufficiently dense to drive compression. In
perceptual quality assessment, human feedback is typically collected as a
single scalar quality score indicating preference of one distorted video over
another. In reality, some videos may be better in some parts but not in others.
We propose an approach to collecting finer-grained feedback by asking users to
use an interactive tool to directly optimize for perceptual quality given a
fixed bitrate. To this end, we built a novel web-tool which allows users to
paint these spatio-temporal importance maps over videos. The tool allows for
interactive successive refinement: we iteratively re-encode the original video
according to the painted importance maps, while maintaining the same bitrate,
thus allowing the user to visually see the trade-off of assigning higher
importance to one spatio-temporal part of the video at the cost of others. We
use this tool to collect data in-the-wild (10 videos, 17 users) and utilize the
obtained importance maps in the context of x264 coding to demonstrate that the
tool can indeed be used to generate videos which, at the same bitrate, look
perceptually better through a subjective study - and are 1.9 times more likely
to be preferred by viewers. The code for the tool and dataset can be found at

to go beyond this paradigm by (1) effectively expressing the relations of
content pieces in the table, and (2) making our model robust to
content-invariant structural transformations. Accordingly, we propose an
equivariance learning framework, which encodes tables with a structure-aware
self-attention mechanism. This prunes the full self-attention structure into an
order-invariant graph attention that captures the connected graph structure of
cells belonging to the same row or column, and it differentiates between
relevant cells and irrelevant cells from the structural perspective. Our
framework also modifies the positional encoding mechanism to preserve the
relative position of tokens in the same cell but enforce position invariance
among different cells. Our technology is free to be plugged into existing
table-to-text generation models, and has improved T5-based models to offer
better performance on ToTTo and HiTab. Moreover, on a harder version of ToTTo,
we preserve promising performance, while previous SOTA systems, even with

interact with two independent non-Markovian baths by using the non-Markovian
quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation approach. Specifically two issues about
quantum information scrambling in open quantum system are addressed. The first
issue is that tripartite mutual information (TMI) can quantify information
scrambling properly via its negative value in closed system, whether it is
still suitable to indicate quantum scrambling in open quantum system. However
we find that negative TMI is not an suitable quantifier of information
scrambling in open quantum system in some cases while negative tripartite
logarithmic negativity (TLN) is more appropriate. The second one is that up to
now almost all the open quantum system effects on information scrambling
reported were focus on the Markovian environment, while the effect of
non-Markovian environment on information scrambling is still elusive.
Significantly our results show that the memory effect of environment will be
beneficial to the emergence of quantum information scrambling. Moreover, it is
found that environment is generally detrimental for information scrambling in a
long time, while in some cases it will be helpful for information scrambling in
a short time.

achieve this in a sequence of magnetohydrodynamics relaxations of small
line-tied pulses of magnetic helicity, each of which is simulated by a suitable
rescaling of the current-carrying part of the field. The whole procedure is
``magnetogram-matching'' because it involves no changes to the normal component
of the field at the photospheric boundary. The method is illustrated by
applying it to an observed force-free configuration whose MFR is modeled with
our regularized Biot--Savart law method. We find that, in spite of the bipolar
character of the external field, the MFR eruption is sustained by two
reconnection processes. The first, which we refer to as breakthrough
reconnection, is analogous to breakout reconnection in quadrupolar
configurations. It occurs at a quasi-separator inside a current layer that
wraps around the erupting MFR and is caused by the photospheric line-tying
effect. The second process is the classical flare reconnection, which develops
at the second quasi-separator inside a vertical current layer that is formed
below the erupting MFR. Both reconnection processes work in tandem with the
magnetic forces of the unstable MFR to propel it through the overlying ambient
field, and their interplay may also be relevant for the thermal processes
occurring in the plasma of solar flares. The considered example suggests that
our method will be beneficial for both the modeling of observed eruptive events
and theoretical studies of eruptions in idealized magnetic configurations.

impenetrable obstacles in time-harmonic acoustic scattering from the associated
far-field data. The proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase,
we determine the interior eigenvalues of the underlying unknown obstacle from
the far-field data via the indicating behaviour of the linear sampling method.
Then we further determine the associated interior eigenfunctions by solving a
constrained optimization problem, again only involving the far-field data. In
the second phase, we propose a novel iteration scheme of Newton's type to
identify the boundary surface of the obstacle. By using the interior
eigenfunctions determined in the first phase, we can avoid computing any direct
scattering problem at each Newton's iteration. The proposed method is
particularly valuable for recovering a sound-hard obstacle, where the Newton's
formula involves the geometric quantities of the unknown boundary surface in a
natural way. We provide rigorous theoretical justifications of the proposed
method. Numerical experiments in both 2D and 3D are conducted, which confirm
the promising features of the proposed imaging scheme. In particular, it can
produce quantitative reconstructions of high accuracy in a very efficient

electron-capture supernovae from super asymptotic giant branch stars -- the
lowest mass stars to end their lives in supernovae -- may receive significantly
lower kicks than typical neutron stars. Given that many massive stars are
members of wide binaries, this suggests the existence of a population of
low-mass ($1.25 < M_\mathrm{psr} / $M$_\odot < 1.3$), wide ($P_\mathrm{orb}
\gtrsim 10^{4}$\,day), eccentric ($e \sim 0.7$), unrecycled ($P_\mathrm{spin}

the mass range of (effectively) single stars leading to electron capture
supernovae, the amount of mass lost prior to the supernova, and the magnitude
of any natal kick imparted on the neutron star. We estimate that one such
binary pulsar should be observable in the Milky Way for every 10,000 isolated

effectiveness and merit of the proposed methods have been demonstrated over a
handful of spatiotemporal dynamical systems governed by spatiotemporal PDEs,

is able to optimize the personalized model aggregation for clients with

polymer crowding influences the flow-induced alignment of suspended colloidal
rods remains unclear when rods and polymers share similar length-scales. We
tackle this problem by analyzing the alignment of colloidal rods suspended in
crowded polymer solutions, and comparing against the case where crowding is
provided by additional colloidal rods in a pure solvent. We find that the
polymer dynamics govern the onset of shear-induced alignment of colloidal rods
suspended in polymer solutions, and the control parameter for the alignment of
rods is the Weissenberg number, quantifying the elastic response of the polymer
to an imposed flow. Moreover, we show that the increasing colloidal alignment
with the shear rate follows a universal trend that is independent of the
surrounding crowding environment. Our results indicate that colloidal rod

rate at which polymer coils are deformed by the flow, aiding the synthesis and

application prospects in many fields. However, a key issue is to obtain the
exact deformation models (i.e., how robot motion affects DLO deformation),
which are hard to theoretically calculate and vary among different DLOs. Thus,
shape control of DLOs is challenging, especially for large deformation control
which requires global and more accurate models. In this paper, we propose a
coupled offline and online data-driven method for efficiently learning a global
deformation model, allowing for both accurate modeling through offline learning
and further updating for new DLOs via online adaptation. Specifically, the
model approximated by a neural network is first trained offline on random data,
then seamlessly migrated to the online phase, and further updated online during
actual manipulation. Several strategies are introduced to improve the model's
efficiency and generalization ability. We propose a convex-optimization-based
controller, and analyze the system's stability using the Lyapunov method.
Detailed simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method can
efficiently and precisely estimate the deformation model, and achieve large
deformation control of untrained DLOs in 2D and 3D dual-arm manipulation tasks
better than the existing methods. It accomplishes all 24 tasks with different
desired shapes on different DLOs in the real world, using only simulation data
for the offline learning.

a need for anomaly detection algorithms that can work across multiple devices.
This thesis suggests a potential alternative to the current anomaly detection
algorithms to be implemented within IoT systems that can be applied across
different types of devices. This algorithm is comprised of both unsupverised
and supervised machine areas of machine learning combining the strongest facet
of each. The algorithm involves the initial k-means clustering of attacks and
assigns them to clusters. Next, the clusters are then used by the AdaBoosted
Naive Bayes supervised learning algorithm in order to teach itself which piece
of data should be clustered to which specific attack. This increases the
accuracy of the proposed algorithm by adding clustered data before the final
classification step, ensuring a more accurate algorithm. The correct
indentification percentage scores for this proposed algorithm range anywhere
from 90% to 100%, as well as rating the proposed algorithms accuracy, precision
and recall. These high scores achieve an accurate, flexible, scalable,
optimised algorithm that could potentially be in different IoT devices,
ensuring strong data integrity and privacy.

Learning (SFL). SFL is a recent distributed training scheme where multiple
clients send intermediate activations (i.e., feature map), instead of raw data,
to a central server. While such a scheme helps reduce the computational load at
the client end, it opens itself to reconstruction of raw data from intermediate
activation by the server. Existing works on protecting SFL only consider
inference and do not handle attacks during training. So we propose ResSFL, a
Split Federated Learning Framework that is designed to be MI-resistant during
training. It is based on deriving a resistant feature extractor via
attacker-aware training, and using this extractor to initialize the client-side
model prior to standard SFL training. Such a method helps in reducing the
computational complexity due to use of strong inversion model in client-side
adversarial training as well as vulnerability of attacks launched in early
training epochs. On CIFAR-100 dataset, our proposed framework successfully
mitigates MI attack on a VGG-11 model with a high reconstruction
Mean-Square-Error of 0.050 compared to 0.005 obtained by the baseline system.
The framework achieves 67.5% accuracy (only 1% accuracy drop) with very low

extracting target-orientation information from the line of sight (LoS) channel

contain clutter or interference. By contrast, in wireless communications,
typically, both the LoS and NLoS paths are exploited for achieving diversity or
multiplexing gains. Hence, we shed light on the NLoS exploitation vs. reduction

transmit power of each signal path to maximize the communication rate, while
guaranteeing the sensing performance for the target. The non-convex problem
formulated is firstly solved in closed form for a single-NLoS-link scenario,
then we harness the popular successive convex approximation (SCA) method for a

mechanistic pathway for achieving solid-state polymer bonding by triggering
rapid macromolecular acceleration through mechanical deformation. Large-scale
molecular simulations reveal that active plastic deformation in glassy
polymers, at temperatures well-below the bulk (and surface) glass transition
temperatures, is sufficient to cause segmental translations of the polymer
chains that lead to interfacial interpenetrations, and formation of new
entanglements. The underlying mechanistic basis for this new type of bonding is
identified as enhanced molecular-scale dilatations (or densifications) in
conjunction with accelerated molecular mobility during plastic deformation. The
reported mechanistic insights open promising avenues for designing new bonding
technologies or material systems, and transformation of the existing ones to
achieve quick and energetically less intensive bonding.

the color from the exemplar to a projection of the 3D shape and the part
segmentation from the projection to the exemplar. Then, the material prediction
network assigns materials from a collection of realistic materials to the

establish a correspondence between the exemplar and shape projection, which

Another key idea of our method is to use the two pairs of (color, segmentation)

(BSD). Recently, there has been an increasing interest in RL techniques for
healthcare applications. We introduce two related applications as motivating
examples. In both applications, the sequential nature of the decisions is
restricted to sequential stopping. Rather than a comprehensive survey, the
focus of the discussion is on solutions using standard tools for these two
relatively simple sequential stopping problems. Both problems are inspired by
adaptive clinical trial design. We use examples to explain the terminology and
mathematical background that underlie each framework and map one to the other.
The implementations and results illustrate the many similarities between RL and
BSD. The results motivate the discussion of the potential strengths and
limitations of each approach.

two initially static bubbles under thermal conditions are investigated by a
Discrete Boltzmann Model (DBM). The spatial distributions of the typical
none-quilibrium quantity, i.e., the Non-Organized Momentum Fluxes (NOMF) during
evolutions are investigated in detail. The density-weighted statistical method
is used to highlight the relationship between the TNE effects and the
morphological or kinetics characteristics of bubble coalescence. It is found
that the $xx$-component and $yy$-component of NOMF are anti-symmetrical; the
$xy$-component changes from an anti-symmetric internal and external double
quadrupole structure to an outer octupole structure during the coalescing
process. More importantly, the evolution of the averaged $xx$-component of NOMF
provides two characteristic instants, which divide the non-equilibrium process
into three stages. The first instant corresponds to the moment when the mean
coalescing speed gets the maximum and at this time the ratio of minor and major
axes is about $1/2$. The second instant corresponds to the moment when the
ratio of minor and major axes gets $1$ for the first time. It is interesting to
find that the three quantities, TNE intensity, acceleration of coalescence and
negative slope of boundary length, show a high degree of correlation and attain
their maxima simultaneously. Surface tension and heat conduction accelerate the
process of bubble coalescence while viscosity delays it. Both surface tension
and viscosity enhance the global non-equilibrium intensity, whereas heat
conduction restrains it. These TNE features and findings present some new
insights into the kinetics of bubble coalescence.

together on this open challenge, which is essential to human-robot interaction.
Critically, the key challenge lies in inferring the category of objects from
linguistic instructions and accurately estimating the 6-DoF information of
unseen objects from the known classes. In contrast, previous works focus on
inferring the pose of object candidates at the instance level. This
significantly limits its applications in real-world scenarios.In this paper, we
propose a language-guided 6-DoF category-level object localization model to
achieve robotic grasping by comprehending human intention. To this end, we
propose a novel two-stage method. Particularly, the first stage grounds the
target in the RGB image through language description of names, attributes, and
spatial relations of objects. The second stage extracts and segments point
clouds from the cropped depth image and estimates the full 6-DoF object pose at
category-level. Under such a manner, our approach can locate the specific
object by following human instructions, and estimate the full 6-DoF pose of a
category-known but unseen instance which is not utilized for training the
model. Extensive experimental results show that our method is competitive with
the state-of-the-art language-conditioned grasp method. Importantly, we deploy
our approach on a physical robot to validate the usability of our framework in

quantum regime makes many classical techniques inapplicable. For long-distance
communication, the only viable approach is teleportation of quantum states,
which requires a prior distribution of entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits.
Establishment of EPs across remote nodes can incur significant latency due to
the low probability of success of the underlying physical processes. To reduce
EP generation latency, prior works have looked at selection of efficient
entanglement-routing paths and simultaneous use of multiple such paths for EP
generation. In this paper, we propose and investigate a complementary technique
to reduce EP generation latency--to pre-distribute EPs over certain
(pre-determined) pairs of network nodes; these pre-distributed EPs can then be
used to generate EPs for the requested pairs, when needed, with lower
generation latency. For such an pre-distribution approach to be most effective,
we need to address an optimization problem of selection of node-pairs where the
EPs should be pre-distributed to minimize the generation latency of expected EP
requests, under a given cost constraint. In this paper, we appropriately
formulate the above optimization problem and design two efficient algorithms,
one of which is a greedy approach based on an approximation algorithm for a
special case. Via extensive evaluations over the NetSquid simulator, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and developed techniques; we show
that our developed algorithms outperform a naive approach by up to an order of

transmits multi-frequency vibrations transperineally. Radio frequency data is
streamed directly from a BK Medical 8848 trans-rectal ultrasound transducer to
an external computer where tissue displacement due to the excitation is
measured using a speckle tracking algorithm. Bandpass sampling is used that
eliminates the need for an ultra fast frame rate to track the tissue motion and
allows for accurate reconstruction at a sampling frequency that is below the
Nyquist rate. A roll motor with computer control is used to rotate the sagittal
array of the transducer and obtain the 3D data. Two CIRS phantoms were used to
validate both the accuracy of the elasticity measurement as well as the

class that substantially limits the scalability to real-world setting where
novel data can be scarce. In this paper, we propose the Incremental-DETR that
does incremental few-shot object detection via fine-tuning and self-supervised
learning on the DETR object detector. To alleviate severe over-fitting with few
novel class data, we first fine-tune the class-specific components of DETR with
self-supervision from additional object proposals generated using Selective
Search as pseudo labels. We further introduce an incremental few-shot
fine-tuning strategy with knowledge distillation on the class-specific
components of DETR to encourage the network in detecting novel classes without
forgetting the base classes. Extensive experiments conducted on standard
incremental object detection and incremental few-shot object detection settings
show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin.

ultracold atomic Fermi gases with a short range attractive interaction
throughout the crossover from BCS to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), in a
two-dimensional optical lattice (2DOL) comprised of two lattice and one
continuum dimensions. We find that the mixing of lattice and continuum
dimensions, together with population imbalance, has an extraordinary effect on
pairing and the superfluidity of atomic Fermi gases. In the balanced case, the
superfluid ground state prevails the majority of the phase space. However, for
relatively small lattice hopping integral $t$ and large lattice constant $d$, a
pair density wave (PDW) emerges unexpectedly at intermediate coupling strength,
and the nature of the in-plane and overall pairing changes from particle-like
to hole-like in the BCS and unitary regimes, associated with an abnormal
increase in the Fermi volume with the pairing strength. In the imbalanced case,
the stable polarized superfluid phase shrinks to only a small portion of the
entire phase space spanned by $t$, $d$, imbalance $p$ and interaction strength
$U$, mainly in the bosonic regime of low $p$, moderately strong pairing, and
relatively large $t$ and small $d$. Due to the Pauli exclusion between paired
and excessive fermions within the confined momentum space, a PDW phase emerges
and the overall pairing evolves from particle-like into hole-like, as the
pairing strength grows stronger in the BEC regime. In both cases, the ground
state property is largely governed by the Fermi surface topology. These
findings are very different from the cases of pure 3D continuum, 3D lattice or

examine the properties of the circular orbits in these spacetimes. The emitted
flux, radiation spectra, disk efficiency, and temperature distribution on the
disk surface are then investigated. The efficiency of the conversion of the
accreting matter into radiation is found to be substantially higher for naked
singularities than that for black holes. We also verify that the flux radiated
from the disk surface is greater for null and JMN1 naked singularities than
black holes. Hence, the accretion disks around naked singularities are much
more luminous than the black holes of the same mass and accretion rate. In the
luminosity spectra of the NNS, we find that the significant contribution of the
low-frequency is coming from the nearby regions of the NNS. Furthermore, the
spectral luminosity distribution for the ""non-zero torque"" at the inner
boundary is also analysed by the inclusion of the non-zero torque value at the
inner edge of the disk. The slopes of the luminosity distribution with respect

models applied to natural images, their application to remote sensing imagery
tends to produce poor results. Remote sensing imagery is often more complicated
than natural images and has its peculiarities such as being of lower
resolution, it contains noise, and often depicting large textured surfaces. As
a result, applying non-specialized SRR models on remote sensing imagery results
in artifacts and poor reconstructions. To address these problems, this paper
proposes an architecture inspired by previous research work, introducing a
novel approach for forcing an SRR model to output realistic remote sensing
images: instead of relying on feature-space similarities as a perceptual loss,
the model considers pixel-level information inferred from the normalized
Digital Surface Model (nDSM) of the image. This strategy allows the application
of better-informed updates during the training of the model which sources from
a task (elevation map inference) that is closely related to remote sensing.
Nonetheless, the nDSM auxiliary information is not required during production
and thus the model infers a super-resolution image without any additional data
besides its low-resolution pairs. We assess our model on two remotely sensed
datasets of different spatial resolutions that also contain the DSM pairs of
the images: the DFC2018 dataset and the dataset containing the national Lidar
fly-by of Luxembourg. Based on visual inspection, the inferred super-resolution
images exhibit particularly superior quality. In particular, the results for
the high-resolution DFC2018 dataset are realistic and almost indistinguishable

left-handed circularly polarized (LCP) waves in an isotropic chiral medium
propagate at different velocities, known as circular birefringence. Here we
show that this is not the case. After obtaining the refraction and reflection
coefficients of any elliptically polarized wave at the surface of a chiral
medium, we derive the conditions for single-mode refraction. By means of the
process of single-mode refraction, we demonstrate that both the refracted RCP
and the refracted LCP waves at normal incidence can be expressed as a coherent
superposition of a pair of orthogonal linearly polarized waves that are rotated
simultaneously. As a result, they must propagate at the same velocity as the
linearly polarized waves. A physical interpretation is also given in detail. In
particular, we show that the state of polarization of any elliptically
polarized wave in a chiral medium is rotated with propagation. Such a rotation
amounts to the rotation of polarization bases without involving the change of
the Jones vector. The rotation of the RCP and LCP waves, as special cases of
elliptically polarized waves, results in two opposite phases as if they
propagated at different phase velocities with their polarization states
transmitted unchanged.

some problems of classification of complex systems, entropy can be given a

combination of visual understanding and natural language processing. While most
existing approaches ignore the visual appearance-motion information at
different temporal scales, it is unknown how to incorporate the multilevel
processing capacity of a deep learning model with such multiscale information.
Targeting these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multilevel Hierarchical
Network (MHN) with multiscale sampling for VideoQA. MHN comprises two modules,
namely Recurrent Multimodal Interaction (RMI) and Parallel Visual Reasoning
(PVR). With a multiscale sampling, RMI iterates the interaction of
appearance-motion information at each scale and the question embeddings to
build the multilevel question-guided visual representations. Thereon, with a
shared transformer encoder, PVR infers the visual cues at each level in
parallel to fit with answering different question types that may rely on the
visual information at relevant levels. Through extensive experiments on three
VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate improved performances than previous
state-of-the-arts and justify the effectiveness of each part of our method.

conducting edge states that traverse the bulk energy gap and display

chiral for each individual spin component and shows spin-momentum-locking for
both spin components on the same edge. Moreover, we study the effect of
external magnetic fields on the gapless edge plasmons. Specifically,
out-of-plane magnetic fields delocalize edge plasmons propagating in one
direction without affecting the other one, while an in-plane magnetic field can
be applied to selectively excite a specific spin-plasmon branch with proper
doping or gating to the system. Our findings may have potential applications in
novel plasmonic and spintronic devices. We also investigate plasmons in the

network as they provide a model with a critical edge in boosting its
performance. Their ability to boost a model's robustness depends on two
factors, viz-a-viz, the model architecture, and the type of augmentations.
Augmentations are very specific to a dataset, and it is not imperative that all
kinds of augmentation would necessarily produce a positive effect on a model's
performance. Hence there is a need to identify augmentations that perform
consistently well across a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the

there is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across
a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture,
convolutions, and the number of parameters used. This paper evaluates the
effect of parameters using 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions on
different augmentation techniques on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.
Statistical Evidence shows that techniques such as Cutouts and Random
horizontal flip were consistent on both parametrically low and high
architectures. Depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed 3x3 convolutions
at higher parameters due to their ability to create deeper networks.
Augmentations resulted in bridging the accuracy gap between the 3x3 and
depth-wise separable convolutions, thus establishing their role in model
generalization. At higher number augmentations did not produce a significant
change in performance. The synergistic effect of multiple augmentations at
higher parameters, with antagonistic effect at lower parameters, was also
evaluated. The work proves that a delicate balance between architectural

mass spectra and wave functions are the experimental mass-gap relation, $\Delta
M_P > \Delta M_V$, where $\Delta M_{P(V)}=M^{2S}_{P(V)}-M^{1S}_{P(V)}$ and the
hierarchy of the decay constants, $f_{1S}>f_{2S}$, between $1S$ and $2S$ meson
states. We maintain the orthogonality of the trial wave functions of the $1S$
and $2S$ states in our variational calculation of the Hamiltonian with the
Coulomb plus confining potentials and treat the hyperfine interaction
perturbatively for the heavy-heavy and heavy-light $P$ and $V$ mesons due to
the nature of the heavy quark symmetry. Realizing that the empirical
constraints cannot be satisfied without mixing of the $1S$ and $2S$ states, we
find the lower bound of the mixing angle $\theta$ between $1S$ and $2S$ states
as $\theta_c = {\rm cot}^{-1}(2\sqrt{6})/2\simeq 6^{\circ}$ and obtain the
optimum value of the mixing angle around $12^\circ$ to cover both the charm and
bottom flavors of the heavy quark. The mixing effects are found to be more
significant to the $2S$ state mesons than to the $1S$ state mesons. The
properties of $1S$ and $2S$ state mesons including the mass spectra, decay
constants, twist-2 distribution amplitudes, and electromagnetic form factors
are computed. Our results are found to be in a good agreement with the
available data and lattice simulations. In particular, the $2S$ state
pseudoscalar $D_s$ meson is predicted to have a mass of $2600$ MeV, which is
very close to the mass of the newly discovered $D_{s0}(2590)^+$ meson by the

device quality is demonstrated by observing Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations
with a period of h/e, h/2e, h/3e, and h/4e, witnessing a coherence length of
many microns. The AB oscillations as well as the type of carriers (electrons or
holes) are seamlessly tunable with gating. The coherence length longer than the
ring perimeter and semiclassical trajectory of the carrier are established from
the analysis of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the
oscillations. Our gate-defined ring geometry has the potential to evolve into a
platform for exploring correlated quantum states such as superconductivity in
interferometers in twisted bilayer graphene.

PiFuHD, are able to estimate accurate geometry of the human shape and clothes,
they require high-resolution input images and are not able to capture complex
body poses. Most training and evaluation is performed on 1k-resolution images
of humans standing in front of the camera under neutral body poses. In this
paper, we leverage publicly available data to extend existing implicit
function-based models to deal with images of humans that can have arbitrary
poses and self-occluded limbs. We argue that the representation power of the
implicit function is not sufficient to simultaneously model details of the
geometry and of the body pose. We, therefore, propose a coarse-to-fine approach
in which we first learn an implicit function that maps the input image to a 3D
body shape with a low level of detail, but which correctly fits the underlying
human pose, despite its complexity. We then learn a displacement map,
conditioned on the smoothed surface and on the input image, which encodes the
high-frequency details of the clothes and body. In the experimental section, we
show that this coarse-to-fine strategy represents a very good trade-off between
shape detail and pose correctness, comparing favorably to the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.

sampling and non-slot based scheduling policies to minimize the maximum

average energy cost and finite queue stability. To overcome the intractability
involving high couplings of such a complex stochastic process, we first focus
on the single-sensor time-average AoI optimization problem and convert the
constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) into an unconstrained Markov
decision process (MDP) by the Lagrangian method. With the infinite-time average
energy and AoI expression expended as the Bellman equation, the single-sensor

steady-state distribution probability. Further, we propose a low-complexity
sub-optimal sampling and semi-distributed scheduling scheme for the
multi-sensor scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme
reduces the MAoI significantly while achieving a balance between the sampling

times. One of its aims is to preserve the semantic content of text being
translated from source to target domain. However, it does not explicitly
maintain other attributes between the source and translated text, for e.g.,
text length and descriptiveness. Maintaining constraints in transfer has
several downstream applications, including data augmentation and de-biasing. We
introduce a method for such constrained unsupervised text style transfer by
introducing two complementary losses to the generative adversarial network
(GAN) family of models. Unlike the competing losses used in GANs, we introduce
cooperative losses where the discriminator and the generator cooperate and
reduce the same loss. The first is a contrastive loss and the second is a
classification loss, aiming to regularize the latent space further and bring
similar sentences across domains closer together. We demonstrate that such
training retains lexical, syntactic, and domain-specific constraints between
domains for multiple benchmark datasets, including ones where more than one
attribute change. We show that the complementary cooperative losses improve
text quality, according to both automated and human evaluation measures.

Fourier intensity data recorded in a coherent X-ray imaging (CXI) experiment is
a challenging problem. The Relaxed Averaged Alternating Reflections (RAAR)
algorithm that is concluded with a number of Error Reduction (ER) iterations is
a popular choice. The RAAR-ER algorithm is usually employed for several
hundreds of times starting with independent random guesses to obtain trial
solutions that are then averaged to obtain the phase retrieval transfer
function (PRTF). In this paper, we examine the phase retrieval solution
obtained using the RAAR-ER methodology from perspective of the complexity
parameter that was introduced by us in recent works. We observe that a single
run of the RAAR-ER algorithm produces a solution with higher complexity
compared to what is expected based on the complexity parameter as manifested by
spurious high frequency grainy artifacts in the solution that do not seem to go
away completely even after a number of trial solutions are averaged. We then
describe a CG-RAAR (Complexity Guided RAAR) phase retrieval method that can
effectively address this inconsistency problem and provides artifact-free
solutions. The CG-RAAR methodology is first illustrated with simulated
unblocked noisy Fourier intensity data and later applied to centrally-blocked
noisy cyanobacterium data which is available from the CXIDB database. Our
simulation and experimental results using CG-RAAR suggest two important
improvements over the popular RAAR-ER algorithm. The CG-RAAR solutions after
the averaging procedure is more reliable in the sense that it contains smallest
features consistent with the resolution estimated by the PRTF curve. Secondly,
since the single run of the CG-RAAR solution does not have grainy artifacts,
the number of trial solutions needed for the averaging process is reduced.

diameter Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) specially designed for future experiments on
the International Space Station (ISS) are compared to the results obtained
during a parabolic flight campaign supported by the European Space Agency.
Since the channel diameter is larger than the capillary limit in normal
gravity, such a device behaves as a loop thermosyphon on ground and as a PHP in
weightless conditions; therefore, the microgravity environment is mandatory for
pulsating mode. Because of a short duration of microgravity during a parabolic
flight, the data concerns only the transient start-up behavior of the device.
One of the most comprehensive models in the literature, namely the in-house 1-D
transient code CASCO (French acronym for Code Avanc{\'e} de Simulation du
Caloduc Oscillant: Advanced PHP Simulation Code in English), has been
configured in terms of geometry, topology, material properties and thermal
boundary conditions to model the experimental device.The comparison between
numerical and experimental results is performed simultaneously on the temporal
evolution of multiple parameters: tube wall temperature, pressure and, wherever
possible, velocity of liquid plugs, their length and temperature distribution
within them. The simulation results agree with the experiment for different
input powers. Temperatures are predicted with a maximum deviation of 7%.
Pressure variation trend is qualitatively captured as well as the liquid plug
velocity, length and temperature distribution. The model also shows the ability
of capturing the instant when the fluid pressure begins to oscillate after the
heat load is supplied, which is a fundamental information for the correct
design of the engineering model that will be tested on the ISS. We also reveal
the existence of strong liquid temperature gradients near the ends of liquid
plugs both experimentally and by simulation. Finally, a theoretical prediction
of the stable functioning of a large diameter PHP in microgravity is given.
Results show that the system provided with an input power of 185W should be
able to reach the steady state after 1min and maintain a stable operation from

the plane (or in a higher-dimensional space) but only in a selfavoiding way, by
putting marks (letters) on visited positions and moving only to unmarked,
therefore unvisited, positions. The key parameter of turedos is their lookup
radius: the distance up to which the head can look around in order to make its
decision of where to move to and what mark to write. In this paper we study the
hierarchy of turedos according to their lookup radius and the dimension of
space using notions of simulation up to spatio-temporal rescaling (a standard
approach in cellular automata or self-assembly systems). We establish that
there is a rich interplay between the turedo parameters and the notion of
simulation considered. We show in particular, for the most liberal simulations,
the existence of 3D turedos of radius 1 that are intrinsically universal for
all radii, but that this is impossible in dimension 2, where some radius 2
turedo are impossible to simulate at radius 1. Using stricter notions of
simulation, intrinsic universality becomes impossible, even in dimension 3, and
there is a strict radius hierarchy. Finally, when restricting to radius 1,
universality is again possible in dimension 3, but not in dimension 2, where we
show however that a radius 3 turedo can simulate all radius 1 turedos.

corresponds to the upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of a
relaxed categorical distribution. The proposed metric is easy to implement
because it has a closed form solution, and empirical results show that it is
close to the actual KLD. Along with this new metric, we propose a relaxed
categorical analytic bound variational autoencoder (ReCAB-VAE) that
successfully models both continuous and relaxed discrete latent

based on known facts in a knowledge graph. Current KGC research mostly follows
an entity ranking protocol, wherein the effectiveness is measured by the
predicted rank of a masked entity in a test triple. The overall performance is
then given by a micro(-average) metric over all individual answer entities. Due
to the incomplete nature of the large-scale knowledge bases, such an entity
ranking setting is likely affected by unlabelled top-ranked positive examples,
raising questions on whether the current evaluation protocol is sufficient to
guarantee a fair comparison of KGC systems. To this end, this paper presents a
systematic study on whether and how the label sparsity affects the current KGC
evaluation with the popular micro metrics. Specifically, inspired by the TREC
paradigm for large-scale information retrieval (IR) experimentation, we create
a relatively ""complete"" judgment set based on a sample from the popular
FB15k-237 dataset following the TREC pooling method. According to our analysis,
it comes as a surprise that switching from the original labels to our
""complete"" labels results in a drastic change of system ranking of a variety of
13 popular KGC models in terms of micro metrics. Further investigation
indicates that the IR-like macro(-average) metrics are more stable and
discriminative under different settings, meanwhile, less affected by label
sparsity. Thus, for KGC evaluation, we recommend conducting TREC-style pooling
to balance between human efforts and label completeness, and reporting also the
IR-like macro metrics to reflect the ranking nature of the KGC task.

This has led to research attention on domain generalization (DG), which aims to
the model's generalization ability to out-of-distribution. Adversarial domain
generalization is a popular approach to DG, but conventional approaches (1)
struggle to sufficiently align features so that local neighborhoods are mixed
across domains; and (2) can suffer from feature space over collapse which can
threaten generalization performance. To address these limitations, we propose
localized adversarial domain generalization with space compactness

an adversarial localized classifier as the domain discriminator, along with a
principled primary branch. This constructs a min-max game whereby the aim of
the featurizer is to produce locally mixed domains. Second, we propose to use a
coding-rate loss to alleviate feature space over collapse. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on the Wilds DG benchmark to validate our approach,
where LADG outperforms leading competitors on most datasets.

the light-matter coupling is crucial. Recently, contributions to the current
that are often missing in the HHG analysis based on the semiconductor Bloch
equations have been pointed out [J. Wilhelm, et.al. PRB 103 125419 (2021)]. In
this paper, by systematically analyzing the doping and gap-size dependence of
HHG in gapped graphene, we discuss the practical impact of such terms. In
particular, we focus on the role of the current $J_{\rm ra}^{(2)}$, which
originates from the change of the intraband dipole via interband transition.
When the gap is small and the system is close to half filling, intraband and
interband currents mostly cancel, thus suppressing the HHG signal - an
important property that is broken when neglecting $J_{\rm ra}^{(2)}$.
Furthermore, without $J_{\rm ra}^{(2)}$, the doping and gap-size dependence of
HHG becomes qualitatively different from the full evaluation. Our results
demonstrate the importance of the consistent expression of the current to study
the parameter dependence of HHG for the small gap systems.

study presents the power management scheme of interdependent MG and EV fleets
aided by a novel EV charg-ing/discharging scheduling algorithm. In this
algorithm, the maximum amount of discharging power from parked EVs is
determined based on the difference between local load demand and photovoltaic
(PV) power production to alleviate imbalances occurred between them. For the
power management of the MG with charging/discharging scheduling of parked EVs
in the PV-based charging station, multi-objective optimization is performed to
minimize the operating cost and grid dependency. In addition, the proposed
scheme maximizes the utilization of EV charging/discharging while satisfying
the charging requirements of parked EVs. Moreover, a more economical and
energy-efficient PV-based charging station is established using the future
trends of local load demand and PV power production predicted by a gated

technology. The explosive growth in image data volume and instrument data
rates, compete with limited on-board storage resources and downlink bandwidth,
making hyperspectral image data compression a mission critical on-board
processing task. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)
extended the previous issue of the CCSDS-123.0 Recommended Standard for multi-
and hyperspectral image compression to provide with Near-Lossless compression
functionality. A key feature of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2 is the improved Hybrid
Entropy Coder, which at low bit rates, provides substantially better
compression performance than the Issue 1 entropy coders. In this paper, we
introduce a high-throughput hardware implementation of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2
Hybrid Entropy Coder. The introduced architecture exploits the systolic design
pattern to provide modularity and latency insensitivity in a deep and elastic
pipeline achieving a constant throughput of 1 sample/cycle with a small FPGA
resource footprint. This architecture is described in portable VHDL RTL and is
implemented, validated and demonstrated on a commercially available Xilinx
KCU105 development board hosting a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale XCKU040 SRAM FPGA,
and thus, is directly transferable to Xilinx Radiation Tolerant Kintex
UltraScale XQRKU060 space-grade devices for space deployments. Moreover,
state-of-the-art SpaceFibre (ECSS-E-ST-50-11C) serial link interface and test
equipment were used in the validation platform to emulate an on-board
deployment. The introduced CCSDS-123.0-B-2 Hybrid Entropy Encoder achieves a
constant throughput performance of 305 MSamples/s. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first published fully-compliant architecture and
high-throughput implementation of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2 Hybrid Entropy Coder,

Monte Carlo method for the Navier-Stokes equations with random data. To
discretize in space and time, the Monte Carlo method is combined with a
suitable deterministic discretization scheme, such as a finite volume method.
We assume that the initial data, force and the viscosity coefficients are
random variables and study both, the statistical convergence rates as well as
the approximation errors. Since the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are
not known to be uniquely solvable in the class of global weak solutions, we
cannot apply pathwise arguments to analyze the random Navier-Stokes equations.
Instead we have to apply intrinsic stochastic compactness arguments via the
Skorokhod representation theorem and the Gy\""{o}ngy-Krylov method. Assuming
that the numerical solutions are bounded in probability, we prove that the
Monte Carlo finite volume method converges to a statistical strong solution.
The convergence rates are discussed as well. Numerical experiments illustrate
theoretical results.

  6DoF Face Pose from Monocular Image","Accepted by TIP",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 3D face reconstruction, orthogonal projection has been widely employed to
substitute perspective projection to simplify the fitting process. This
approximation performs well when the distance between camera and face is far
enough. However, in some scenarios that the face is very close to camera or
moving along the camera axis, the methods suffer from the inaccurate
reconstruction and unstable temporal fitting due to the distortion under the
perspective projection. In this paper, we aim to address the problem of
single-image 3D face reconstruction under perspective projection. Specifically,
a deep neural network, Perspective Network (PerspNet), is proposed to
simultaneously reconstruct 3D face shape in canonical space and learn the
correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points, by which the 6DoF (6 Degrees of
Freedom) face pose can be estimated to represent perspective projection.
Besides, we contribute a large ARKitFace dataset to enable the training and
evaluation of 3D face reconstruction solutions under the scenarios of
perspective projection, which has 902,724 2D facial images with ground-truth 3D
face mesh and annotated 6DoF pose parameters. Experimental results show that
our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a significant

recently emerging framework where a cohort of learners with heterogeneous local
models play a MAB game and communicate their aggregated feedback to a parameter
server to learn the global feedback model. Federated learning models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as model-update attacks or data
poisoning. In this work, we study an FMAB problem in the presence of Byzantine
clients who can send false model updates that pose a threat to the learning
process. We borrow tools from robust statistics and propose a
median-of-means-based estimator: Fed-MoM-UCB, to cope with the Byzantine
clients. We show that if the Byzantine clients constitute at most half the
cohort, it is possible to incur a cumulative regret on the order of ${\cal O}

communication cost between the clients and the parameter server. We analyze the
interplay between the algorithm parameters, unavoidable error margin, regret,
communication cost, and the arms' suboptimality gaps. We demonstrate

uncertainty quantification of Finite Element (FE) models based on modal

approach to identify experimental modal parameters from time-history data and
employs a class of maximum-entropy probability distributions to account for the
mismatch between the modal parameters. It also considers a parameterized
probability distribution for capturing the variability of structural parameters
across multiple data sets. In this framework, the computation is addressed
through Expectation-Maximization (EM) strategies, empowered by Laplace
approximations. As a result, a new rationale is introduced for assigning
optimal weights to the modal properties when updating structural parameters.
According to this framework, the modal features weights are equal to the
inverse of the aggregate uncertainty, comprised of the identification and
prediction uncertainties. The proposed framework is coherent in modeling the
entire process of inferring structural parameters from response-only
measurements and is comprehensive in accounting for different sources of
uncertainty, including the variability of both modal and structural parameters
over multiple data sets, as well as their identification uncertainties.
Numerical and experimental examples are employed to demonstrate the HBM
framework, wherein the environmental and operational conditions are almost
constant. It is observed that the variability of parameters across data sets
remains the dominant source of uncertainty while being much larger than the
identification uncertainties.

leveraging advanced data-processing capabilities to support decision-making

presented by ever-increasing levels of machine autonomy. Within this context,
we focus on the following questions: (i) How does HCI currently look like for

development, deployment, and maintenance? (ii) Do the expectations of HCI
within AutoML frameworks vary for different types of users and stakeholders?
(iii) How can HCI be managed so that AutoML solutions acquire human trust and
broad acceptance? (iv) As AutoML systems become more autonomous and capable of
learning from complex open-ended environments, will the fundamental nature of
HCI evolve? To consider these questions, we project existing literature in HCI
into the space of AutoML; this connection has, to date, largely been
unexplored. In so doing, we review topics including user-interface design,
human-bias mitigation, and trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally,
to rigorously gauge the future of HCI, we contemplate how AutoML may manifest
in effectively open-ended environments. This discussion necessarily reviews
projected developmental pathways for AutoML, such as the incorporation of
reasoning, although the focus remains on how and why HCI may occur in such a

serves to identify key research directions aimed at better facilitating the
roles and modes of human interactions with both current and future AutoML

the Fog with a self-adaptive peer-to-peer (P2P) monitoring solution that can
opportunistically adjust its behavior according to the collected data
exploiting a lightweight rule-based expert system.
  Empirical results show that adaptation can improve monitoring accuracy, while
reducing network and power consumption at the cost of higher memory
consumption.

symmetry algebra of the system. It is demonstrated that the symmetry algebra
contains suitable quadratic subalgebras, each of which is generated by three
generators with relevant structure constants, which may depend on central
elements. We construct corresponding Casimir operators and present
finite-dimensional unirreps and structure functions via the realizations of
these subalgebras in the context of deformed oscillators. By imposing
constraints on the structure functions, we obtain the spectrum of the 3D
nondegenerate superintegrable system. We also show that this model is
multiseparable and admits separation of variables in cylindrical polar and
paraboloidal coordinates. We derive the physical spectrum by solving the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation of the system and compare the result with those
obtained from algebraic derivations.

and more studies focus on protecting DNN models from intellectual property (IP)
infringement. Many existing methods apply digital watermarking to protect the
DNN models. The majority of them either embed a watermark directly into the
internal network structure/parameters or insert a zero-bit watermark by
fine-tuning a model to be protected with a set of so-called trigger samples.
Though these methods work very well, they were designed for individual DNN
models, which cannot be directly applied to deep ensemble models (DEMs) that
combine multiple DNN models to make the final decision. It motivates us to
propose a novel black-box watermarking method in this paper for DEMs, which can
be used for verifying the integrity of DEMs. In the proposed method, a certain
number of sensitive samples are carefully selected through mimicking real-world
DEM attacks and analyzing the prediction results of the sub-models of the
non-attacked DEM and the attacked DEM on the carefully crafted dataset. By
analyzing the prediction results of the target DEM on these carefully crafted
sensitive samples, we are able to verify the integrity of the target DEM.
Different from many previous methods, the proposed method does not modify the
original DEM to be protected, which indicates that the proposed method is
lossless. Experimental results have shown that the DEM integrity can be
reliably verified even if only one sub-model was attacked, which has good
potential in practice.

drinking water of 10 parts per billion ppb. Typically, to reach this level of

low cost devices, this paper explores the prospects of using a volume reduction
technique of a boiled water sample doped with Lead-210 ($^{210}Pb$), as a means
to increase the solute's concentration. $^{210}$Pb is a radioactive lead
isotope and its concentration in a water sample can be measured with e.g. High
Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors at the Boulby Underground Germanium Suite.
Concentrations close to the WHO limit have not been examined. This paper
presents a measurement of the volume reduction technique retaining $99\pm(9)\%$
of $^{210}$Pb starting from a concentration of $1.9\times10^{-6}$ ppb before
reduction and resulting in $2.63\times10^{-4}$ ppb after reduction. This work
also applies the volume reduction technique to London tap water and reports the
radioassay results from gamma counting in HPGe detectors. Among other
radio-isotopes, $^{40}$K, $^{210}$Pb, $^{131}$I and $^{177}$Lu were identified
at measured concentrations of $2.83\times10^{3}$ ppb, $2.55\times10^{-7}$ ppb,
$5.06\times10^{-10}$ ppb and $5.84\times10^{-10}$ ppb in the London tap water

inferred from the same water sample at a measured concentration of 0.012 ppb,

this work, we circumvent this problem with a method that maps the relevant

mandates that every pair of successive $1$s be separated by at least $d$ $0$s.
Consider any sequence $\{{\mathcal{C}_m}\}_{m\geq 1}$ of RM codes with
increasing blocklength, whose rates approach $R$, in the limit as the
blocklength goes to infinity. We show that for any linear $(d,\infty)$-RLL
subcode, $\hat{\mathcal{C}}_m$, of the code $\mathcal{C}_m$, it holds that the
rate of $\hat{\mathcal{C}}_m$ is at most $\frac{R}{d+1}$, in the limit as the
blocklength goes to infinity. We also consider scenarios where the coordinates
of the RM codes are not ordered according to the standard lexicographic
ordering, and derive rate upper bounds for linear $(d,\infty)$-RLL subcodes, in
those cases as well. Next, for the setting of a $(d,\infty)$-RLL
input-constrained binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel, we devise a new
coding scheme, based on cosets of RM codes. Again, in the limit of blocklength
going to infinity, this code outperforms any linear subcode of an RM code, in
terms of rate, for low noise regimes of the channel.

  Beside detection performance, robustness of a detector to outliers is also of
vital importance, which can often be analyzed via the influence functions.

Since our compression method is training-free, it uses few computing resources

modifications, in the maintenance of mean pressure and half-amplitude
variations using different PEEP valves and to analyse the impact of
antibacterial (AB) or antibacterial-viral (ABV) pre-valve PEEP filters on the
effective PEEP delivered to the patients. Four pressure ports were installed on
each mask (three on helmet), mean values and half amplitudes of pressure were
recorded. Tests were performed with any, AB, ABV filter before the PEEP valve.
CPAP helmet was the most efficient interface producing more stable mean
pressure and less prominent half-amplitude variations but the non-medical
masks, especially after the modifications, maintained a stable mean pressure
value with only a moderate increase of half-amplitude. The use of AB and ABV
filters, produced respectively an increase of 2,23% and 16.5% in mean pressure,
compared to no filter condition. CPAP helmet is the most reliable interface in
terms of detected performance, but readapted masks can assure almost a similar
performance. The use of ABV filters before the PEEP valve significantly
increases the detected mean pressure while the AB filters have almost a neutral
effect.

object property labels are provided to the GCN to adjust in-hand manipulation

hierarchically and a GrowingNet(Growing hair strands using neural network) to
efficiently generate 3D hair strands in parallel. Specifically, we perform a
coarse-to-fine manner and propose a novel voxel-aligned implicit function

local details extracted from a hair luminance map. To improve the efficiency of
a traditional hair growth algorithm, we adopt a local neural implicit function

varying coefficient model is flexible, but leaner and simpler models are
preferred for applications. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether the
estimated coefficient function varies significantly with covariates. If the

reduced to a simpler model, such as a constant or zero. Accordingly, the
hypothesis test for model assessment in the varying coefficient model has been

stable leader drives decisions with linear communication and two round-trips of
message. However, the unifying proposing-voting pattern is not sufficient to
improve the bandwidth and concurrency performance of the modern system. In
addition, the delay corresponding to two rounds of message to produce a
certified proposal in that scheme is a significant performance bottleneck.
Thus, this study developed a new consensus protocol, Multi-pipeline HotStuff,
for permissioned blockchain. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
first protocol that combines multiple HotStuff instances to propose batches in
order without a concurrent proposal, such that proposals are made
optimistically when a correct replica realizes that the current proposal is
valid and will be certified by quorum votes in the near future. Because
simultaneous proposing and voting are allowed by the proposed protocol without
transaction duplication, it produced more proposals in every two rounds of
messages. In addition, it further boosted the throughput at a comparable
latency with that of HotStuff. The evaluation experiment conducted confirmed
that the throughput of Multi-pipeline HotStuff outperformed that of the
state-of-the-art protocols by approximately 60\% without significantly
increasing end-to-end latency under varying system sizes. Moreover, the
proposed optimization also performed better when it suffers a bad network

the different computing units is often the bottleneck and gradient compression
is widely used to reduce the number of bits sent within each communication
round of iterative methods. There are two classes of compression operators and
separate algorithms making use of them. In the case of unbiased random
compressors with bounded variance (e.g., rand-k), the DIANA algorithm of
Mishchenko et al. (2019), which implements a variance reduction technique for
handling the variance introduced by compression, is the current state of the
art. In the case of biased and contractive compressors (e.g., top-k), the EF21
algorithm of Richt\'arik et al. (2021), which instead implements an
error-feedback mechanism, is the current state of the art. These two classes of
compression schemes and algorithms are distinct, with different analyses and
proof techniques. In this paper, we unify them into a single framework and
propose a new algorithm, recovering DIANA and EF21 as particular cases. Our
general approach works with a new, larger class of compressors, which has two
parameters, the bias and the variance, and includes unbiased and biased
compressors as particular cases. This allows us to inherit the best of the two
worlds: like EF21 and unlike DIANA, biased compressors, like top-k, whose good
performance in practice is recognized, can be used. And like DIANA and unlike
EF21, independent randomness at the compressors allows to mitigate the effects
of compression, with the convergence rate improving when the number of parallel
workers is large. This is the first time that an algorithm with all these
features is proposed. We prove its linear convergence under certain conditions.
Our approach takes a step towards better understanding of two so-far distinct
worlds of communication-efficient distributed learning.

would like to purchase based on her short behavior sequence. The current
approaches towards session-based recommendation only focus on modeling users'
interest preferences, while they all ignore a key attribute of an item, i.e.,
the price. Many marketing studies have shown that the price factor
significantly influences users' behaviors and the purchase decisions of users
are determined by both price and interest preferences simultaneously. However,
it is nontrivial to incorporate price preferences for session-based
recommendation. Firstly, it is hard to handle heterogeneous information from
various features of items to capture users' price preferences. Secondly, it is
difficult to model the complex relations between price and interest preferences
in determining user choices.
  To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method Co-guided
Heterogeneous Hypergraph Network (CoHHN) for session-based recommendation.
Towards the first challenge, we devise a heterogeneous hypergraph to represent
heterogeneous information and rich relations among them. A dual-channel
aggregating mechanism is then designed to aggregate various information in the
heterogeneous hypergraph. After that, we extract users' price preferences and
interest preferences via attention layers. As to the second challenge, a
co-guided learning scheme is designed to model the relations between price and
interest preferences and enhance the learning of each other. Finally, we
predict user actions based on item features and users' price and interest
preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed CoHHN. Further analysis reveals the significance
of price for session-based recommendation.

loss of the initial bulk-synchronous behavior of a parallel code so that its
processes become desynchronized. This occurs most prominently in memory-bound

Simulation results have shown that the proposed LSTM-DCGAN based network is

a window, of size less than the fixed bound in which the smallest priority is
even. In this work, we focus on the bounded timed window parity objective. Such
an objective is satisfied if there exists some bound for which the fixed

permit early and frequent conflict detection while developing in parallel. The
presented approach introduces multi-version models based on typed graphs that
permit to store changes and multiple versions in one graph in a compact form

extract each version individually, (2) to report all possible merge conflicts

violations of well-formedness conditions that will result for merges of any two
versions independent of any merge decisions without the need to merge all pairs

multi-version models, proves their correctness w.r.t.~the usually employed
three-way-merge, and reports on preliminary experiments concerning the

gas spirals into the inner regions of the disk. We recently presented a simple
""modified accretion disk"" model of viscous galactic disks in which
star-formation is fed by a radial flow of gas. However, little observational
evidence has been presented for such inflows, which are expected to be only a
few km s$^{-1}$ in the central regions of the disk, i.e. within three disk
scale-lengths, but could reach of order 50-100 km s$^{-1}$ in the very outer
disk. The effects of systematic inflow on the 2-d velocity field are examined
and it is shown that these are quite similar to those produced by geometric
warps of the disks, with twist distortions of both the kinematic major and
minor axes. This makes it potentially difficult to distinguish between these in
practice. By comparing the handedness of the observed twisting of the kinematic
axes and of the spiral arms for a sample of nearby galaxies, we find (assuming
that the spiral arms are generally trailing) that the effects of warps are in
fact likely to dominate over the effects of radial inflows. However, the common
practice of treating these twist distortions of the kinematic major and minor
axes as being due only to warps can lead, for galaxies of low-to-intermediate
inclinations, to substantial underestimates of any systematic inflow.

industry for quality control and process monitoring. Semantic segmentation
models have gained importance since they allow for more precise examination.
These models, however, require large image datasets in order to achieve a fair
accuracy level. In some cases, training data is sparse or lacks of sufficient
annotation, a fact that especially applies to highly specialized production
environments. Data augmentation represents a common strategy to extend the
dataset. Still, it only varies the image within a narrow range. In this
article, a novel strategy is proposed to augment small image datasets. The
approach is applied to surface monitoring of carbon fibers, a specific industry
use case. We apply two different methods to create binary labels: a
problem-tailored trigonometric function and a WGAN model. Afterwards, the
labels are translated into color images using pix2pix and used to train a
U-Net. The results suggest that the trigonometric function is superior to the
WGAN model. However, a precise examination of the resulting images indicate
that WGAN and image-to-image translation achieve good segmentation results and
only deviate to a small degree from traditional data augmentation. In summary,
this study examines an industry application of data synthesization using
generative adversarial networks and explores its potential for monitoring
systems of production environments. \keywords{Image-to-Image Translation,

determination of the evolutionary status of supernova remnants (SNRs). Data
obtained by radio observations in continuum are used. There are three different
methods underlying the new concept: the first one based on the location of
observationally obtained radio surface brightness and corresponding diameter of
an SNR on the theoretically derived Sigma-D tracks; the second one based on the
forms of radio spectra; and the third one, based on the magnetic field
strengths that are estimated through the equipartition (eqp) calculation. Using
a combination of these methods, developed over the last two decades by the
Belgrade SNR Research Group, we can estimate the evolutionary status of SNRs.
This concept helps radio observers to determine preliminarily the stage of the
evolution of an SNR observed in radio domain. Additionally, this concept was
applied for several SNRs, observed by the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA), and the corresponding results are reviewed here. Moreover, some of the
results are revised in this review to reflect the updated recently published
Sigma-D and eqp analyses.

management in databases, which combines Boolean data provenance with the field
of interactive Boolean evaluation. In turn, interactive Boolean evaluation aims
at unveiling the underlying truth value of a Boolean expression by frugally
probing the truth values of individual values. The required number of probes
depends on the Boolean provenance structure and on the (a-priori unknown) probe
answers. Prior work has analyzed and aimed to optimize the expected number of
probes, where expectancy is with respect to a probability distribution over
probe answers. This paper gives a novel worst-case analysis for the problem,
inspired by the decision tree depth of Boolean functions.
  Specifically, we introduce a notion of evasive provenance expressions, namely
expressions, where one may need to probe all variables in the worst case. We
show that read-once expressions are evasive, and identify an additional class
of expressions (acyclic monotone 2-DNF) for which evasiveness may be decided in
PTIME. As for the more general question of finding the optimal strategy, we
show that it is coNP-hard in general. We are still able to identify a sub-class
of provenance expressions that is ""far from evasive"", namely, where an optimal
worst-case strategy probes only log(n) out of the n variables in the
expression, and show that we can find this optimal strategy in polynomial time.

temperature in PDRs leads to a selective freeze-out of oxygen-bearing ice
species due to their higher condensation temperatures and we study changes in
the ice mantle structures depending on the PDR parameters, in particular the
impinging UV field. Selective freeze-out can produce enhanced C abundances and
higher gas temperatures resulting in a fine-structure line emission of atomic
carbon [C] enhanced by up to 50% if surface reactions are considered. We show
how recent ALMA observations of HCO$^+$ emission in the Orion Bar with high
spatial resolution on the scale of individual clumps can be interpreted in the
context of non-stationary, clumpy PDR ensembles. Additionally, we introduce

I and Fe I lines. We constructed and used a 12-level model for Mg I atom that
realistically reproduces the $b_2$ line profile of the mean quiet Sun. We
tested the applicability of the WFA to the spectra computed from the FAL C
atmospheric model with ad hoc added different magnetic and velocity fields.
Then, we extended the analysis to the spectra computed from two 3D
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) MURaM simulations of the solar atmosphere. The first
MHD cube is used to estimate the Stokes V formation heights of each spectral
line. These heights correspond to optical depths at which the standard
deviation of the difference between the WFA-inferred magnetic field and the
magnetic field in the MHD cube is minimal. The estimated formation heights are
verified using the second MHD cube. The LOS magnetic field retrieved by the WFA
is reliable for the magnetic field strength up to 1.4 kG even when moderate
velocity gradients are present. The exception is the Fe I line, for which we
found a strong discrepancy in the inferred magnetic fields because of the line
blend. We estimated the Stokes $V$ formation heights of each spectral line to
be: $\log\tau_\mathrm{Fe}=-2.6$, $\log\tau_\mathrm{Mg}=-3.3$, and
$\log\tau_\mathrm{Ti}=-1.8$. We were able to estimate the LOS magnetic field
from the MURaM cube at these heights with the uncertainty of 150 G for the Fe I
and Ti I lines and only 40 G for the Mg I $b_2$ line. Using the WFA we can
quickly get a reliable estimate of the structure of the LOS magnetic field in
the observed region. The Mg I $b_2$ line profile calculated from the quiet Sun
MURaM simulation agrees very well with the observed mean spectrum of the quiet
Sun.

order of magnitude as the QFT time-splitting parameter multiplied with the

unstable situation if not extra mechanical forces, typically surface tension
forces, are brought into consideration. 3) We analyze how the presence of a
radial Casimir repulsive pressure modifies the filling process of a spherical
vacuum hole in an infinite fluid (the Reynolds problem), with the result that a
bounce occurs at a finite though very small radius. 4) As a comment on an
apparently similar situation in general relativity, we consider the
gravitational collapse of a singular shell. It might seem natural to allow for
the presence of a repulsive Casimir pressure in this case also, thereby
obtaining a bounce-like situation again. However, we have to conclude that such

thus a high price of anarchy. To alleviate this issue, the system designer can
use decentralized mechanisms that regulate the use of each resource (e.g.,
using local queuing protocols or scheduling mechanisms), but with only limited
information regarding the state of the system. These information limitations
have a severe impact on what such decentralized mechanisms can achieve, so most
of the success stories in this literature have had to make restrictive
assumptions (e.g., by either restricting the structure of the networks or the
types of cost functions).
  In this paper, we overcome some of the obstacles that the literature has
imposed on decentralized mechanisms, by designing mechanisms that are enhanced
with predictions regarding the missing information. Specifically, inspired by
the big success of the literature on ""algorithms with predictions"", we design
decentralized mechanisms with predictions and evaluate their price of anarchy
as a function of the prediction error, focusing on two very well-studied

However, the continuous increase in global data center energy consumption
combined with the increase of the racks' power dissipation calls for the use of
more efficient alternatives. Immersion cooling is one such alternative. In this
paper, we quantitatively examine and compare air cooling and immersion cooling
solutions. The examined characteristics include power usage efficiency (PUE),
computing and power density, cost, and maintenance overheads. A direct
comparison shows a reduction of about 50% in energy consumption and a reduction
of about two-thirds of the occupied space, by using immersion cooling. In
addition, the higher heat capacity of used liquids in immersion cooling
compared to air allows for much higher rack power densities. Moreover,
immersion cooling requires less capital and operational expenditures. However,
challenging maintenance procedures together with the increased number of IT
failures are the main downsides. By selecting immersion cooling, cloud
providers must trade-off the decrease in energy and cost and the increase in
power density with its higher maintenance and reliability concerns. Finally, we
argue that retrofitting an air-cooled data center with immersion cooling will
result in high costs and is generally not recommended.

heat and chemical species. It can lead to enhanced mixing through convective
overshooting and excitation of internal gravity waves (IGWs) at convective
boundaries. The relationship between these processes is still not well
understood and requires global hydrodynamic simulations to capture the
important large-scale dynamics. The steep stratification in stellar interiors
suggests that the radial extent of such simulations can affect the convection
dynamics, the IGWs in the stably stratified radiative zone, and the depth of
the overshooting layer. We investigate these effects using two-dimensional
global simulations performed with the fully compressible stellar hydrodynamics
code MUSIC. We compare eight different radial truncations of the same
solar-like stellar model evolved over approximately 400 convective turnover
times. We find that the location of the inner boundary has an insignificant
effect on the convection dynamics, the convective overshooting and the
travelling IGWs. We relate this to the background conditions at the lower
convective boundary which are unaffected by the truncation, as long as a
significantly deep radiative layer is included in the simulation domain.
However, we find that extending the outer boundary by only a few percent of the
stellar radius significantly increases the velocity and temperature
perturbations in the convection zone, the overshooting depth, the power and the
spectral slope of the IGWs. The effect is related to the background conditions
at the outer boundary, which are determined in essence by the hydrostatic
stratification and the given luminosity.

analysis shows that localization or periodicity requirements on perturbations,

previous works considering localized perturbations, we decompose the semigroup
generated by the linearization about the wave train and introduce a
spatio-temporal phase modulation to capture the most critical dynamics, which
is governed by a viscous Burgers' equation. We then aim to close a nonlinear
stability argument by iterative estimates on the corresponding Duhamel
formulation, where, hampered by the lack of localization, we must rely on
diffusive smoothing to render decay of the semigroup. Yet, this decay is not
strong enough to control all terms in the Duhamel formulation. We address this
difficulty by applying the Cole-Hopf transform to eliminate the critical
Burgers'-type nonlinearities. Ultimately, we establish nonlinear stability of
diffusively spectrally stable wave trains against
$C_{\mathrm{ub}}^2$-perturbations. Moreover, we show that the perturbed

  Revised, 9 pages (7 main + 2 reference pages)",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The automatic identification of harmful content online is of major concern
for social media platforms, policymakers, and society. Researchers have studied
textual, visual, and audio content, but typically in isolation. Yet, harmful
content often combines multiple modalities, as in the case of memes, which are
of particular interest due to their viral nature. With this in mind, here we
offer a comprehensive survey with a focus on harmful memes. Based on a
systematic analysis of recent literature, we first propose a new typology of
harmful memes, and then we highlight and summarize the relevant state of the
art. One interesting finding is that many types of harmful memes are not really
studied, e.g., such featuring self-harm and extremism, partly due to the lack
of suitable datasets. We further find that existing datasets mostly capture
multi-class scenarios, which are not inclusive of the affective spectrum that
memes can represent. Another observation is that memes can propagate globally
through repackaging in different languages and that they can also be
multilingual, blending different cultures. We conclude by highlighting several
challenges related to multimodal semiotics, technological constraints, and
non-trivial social engagement, and we present several open-ended aspects such
as delineating online harm and empirically examining related frameworks and
assistive interventions, which we believe will motivate and drive future
research.

based on deep language models like BERT. Early work breaks the documents into
short passage-like chunks. These chunks are independently mapped to scalar
scores or latent vectors, which are then pooled into a final relevance score.
These encode-and-pool methods however inevitably introduce an information
bottleneck: the low dimension representations. In this paper, we propose
instead to model full query-to-document interaction, leveraging the attention
operation and modular Transformer re-ranker framework. First, document chunks
are encoded independently with an encoder module. An interaction module then
encodes the query and performs joint attention from the query to all document
chunk representations. We demonstrate that the model can use this new degree of
freedom to aggregate important information from the entire document. Our
experiments show that this design produces effective re-ranking on two
classical IR collections Robust04 and ClueWeb09, and a large-scale supervised
collection MS-MARCO document ranking.

were ejected into interstellar space by gravitational encounters with the
planets. Debris disks observations and numerical simulations indicate that many
other planetary systems, now known to be quite common, would have undergone a
similar dynamical clearing process. It is therefore expected that the galaxy
should be teeming with expelled planetesimals, largely unaltered since their
ejection. This is why astronomers were perplexed that none had been detected
passing through the solar system. Then, in 2017, the discovery of1I/'Oumuamua
transformed the situation from puzzlement to bewilderment. Its brief visit and
limited observations left important questions about its nature and origin
unanswered and raised the possibility that 1I/'Oumuamua could be a
never-seen-before intermediate product of planet formation. If so, this could
open a new observational window to study the primordial building blocks of
planets, setting unprecedented constraints on planet formation models. Two
years later 2I/Borisov was discovered, with an unquestionable cometary
composition, confirming that a population of icy interstellar planetesimals
exists. These objects have remained largely unchanged since their ejection,
like time capsules of their planetary system most distant past. Interstellar
planetesimals could potentially be trapped into star and planet formation
environments, acting as seeds for planet formation, helping overcome the
meter-size barrier that challenges the growth of cm-sized pebbles into km-sized
objects. Interstellar planetesimals play a pivotal role in our understanding of
planetary system formation and evolution and point to the possibility that one
day, we will be able to hold a fragment from another world in our hand.

the different solutions necessitated by each. The direct alignment problem
considers whether an AI system accomplishes the goals of the entity operating
it. In contrast, the social alignment problem considers the effects of an AI
system on larger groups or on society more broadly. In particular, it also
considers whether the system imposes externalities on others. Whereas solutions
to the direct alignment problem center around more robust implementation,
social alignment problems typically arise because of conflicts between
individual and group-level goals, elevating the importance of AI governance to
mediate such conflicts. Addressing the social alignment problem requires both
enforcing existing norms on their developers and operators and designing new

article, we prove a central limit theorem for $T(H,G_n)$ with explicit error
rates. The error rates arise from graph counts of collections formed by joining
copies of $H$ that we call good joins. Counts of good joins are closely related
to the fourth moment of a normalized version of $T(H,G_{n})$, and that
connection allows us to show a fourth moment phenomenon for the central limit
theorem.
  Precisely, for $c\ge 30$, we show that $T(H,G_n)$ (appropriately centered and
rescaled) converges in distribution to $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ whenever its fourth
moment converges to 3 (the fourth moment of the standard normal distribution).
We show the convergence of the fourth moment is necessary to obtain a normal
limit when $c\ge 2$. The combination of these results implies that the fourth

undecidable, we show that equivalence up to fixed delay is decidable. Moreover,
we show that our notion has good completeness properties: we prove that two
SSTs are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent up to some (computable)
bounded delay. Together with the regularity of our delay notion, it provides an
alternative proof that SSTs equivalence is decidable. Finally, the definition
of our delay notion is machine-independent, as it only depends on the origin
semantics of SSTs. As a corollary, the completeness result also holds for

quiet corona. If nanoflares follow the same physics as their larger
counterparts, they should emit hard X-rays (HXRs) but with a rather faint
intensity. A copious and continuous presence of nanoflares would deliver
enormous amounts of energy into the solar corona, possibly accounting for its
high temperatures. To date, there has not been any direct observation of such
sustained and persistent HXRs from the quiescent Sun. However, Hannah et al. in
2010 constrained the quiet Sun HXR emission using almost 12 days of quiescent
solar-off-pointing observations by RHESSI. These observations set upper limits
at $3.4\times 10^{-2}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ and
$9.5\times 10^{-4}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ for the 3-6
keV and 6-12 keV energy ranges, respectively. Observing feeble HXRs is
challenging because it demands high sensitivity and dynamic range instruments
in HXRs. The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket
experiment excels in these two attributes. Particularly, FOXSI completed its
third successful flight (FOXSI-3) on September 7th, 2018. During FOXSI-3's
flight, the Sun exhibited a fairly quiet configuration, displaying only one
aged non-flaring active region. Using the entire $\sim$6.5 minutes of FOXSI-3
data, we constrained the quiet Sun emission in HXRs. We found $2\sigma$ upper
limits in the order of $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$
keV$^{-1}$ for the 5-10 keV energy range. FOXSI-3's upper limit is consistent
with what was reported by Hannah et al., 2010, but FOXSI-3 achieved this result
using $\sim$1/2640 less time than RHESSI. A possible future spacecraft using
FOXSI's concept would allow enough observation time to constrain the current

the combination of FS power spectrum measurements with the CMB data

detection systems continuously undergo patches and updates to defend against
these threats. Most of the latest approaches in malware detection use Machine
Learning (ML). Against the robustifying effort of detection systems, raise the
\emph{evasion attacks}, where an adversary changes its targeted samples so that
they are misclassified as benign. This paper considers two kinds of evasion
attacks: feature-space and problem-space. \emph{Feature-space} attacks consider
an adversary who manipulates ML features to evade the correct classification
while minimizing or constraining the total manipulations.
\textit{Problem-space} attacks refer to evasion attacks that change the actual
sample. Specifically, this paper analyzes the gap between these two types in
the Android malware domain. The gap between the two types of evasion attacks is
examined via the retraining process of classifiers using each one of the
evasion attack types. The experiments show that the gap between these two types
of retrained classifiers is dramatic and may increase to 96\%. Retrained
classifiers of feature-space evasion attacks have been found to be either less
effective or completely ineffective against problem-space evasion attacks.
Additionally, exploration of different problem-space evasion attacks shows that
retraining of one problem-space evasion attack may be effective against other
problem-space evasion attacks.

with several shapes in simulation, and adapting to arbitrary unseen shapes in
real world with minimal sim-to-real cost. The core idea is to decouple the
generalization of the sensory-motor policy to the design of a fast-adaptable
perception module and a simulated generic policy module. The framework consists
of a segmentation network (SN), a virtual sensor network (VSN), and a
controller network (CN). Concretely, the VSN is trained to measure the pose of
the unseen shape from a segmented image. After that, given the shape-agnostic
pose measurement, the CN is trained to achieve generic peg-in-hole. Finally,
when applying to real unseen holes, we only have to fine-tune the SN required
by the simulated VSN+CN. To further minimize the transfer cost, we propose to
automatically collect and annotate the data for the SN after one-minute human
teaching. Simulated and real-world results are presented under the
configurations of eye-to/in-hand. An electric vehicle charging system with the
proposed policy inside achieves a 10/10 success rate in 2-3s, using only

techniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static
environments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case
for most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the
objects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene
context by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation
results are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the
quality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present
a robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex
and highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object
feature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice
to the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our
baseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering
and visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of
segmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur.
Thorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the
proposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify
dynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the
proposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a
processing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical
applications. Both training data and the proposed method is open sourced at

antagonistic players and played over graphs. This model is widely accepted as
providing the adequate framework for formalizing the synthesis question for
reactive systems. This important application motivates the question of strategy
complexity: which valuations (or payoff functions) admit optimal positional
strategies (without memory)? Valuations for which both players have optimal
positional strategies have been characterized by Gimbert and Zielonka for
finite graphs and by Colcombet and Niwi\'nski for infinite graphs. However, for
reactive synthesis, existence of optimal positional strategies for the opponent
(which models an antagonistic environment) is irrelevant. Despite this fact,
not much is known about valuations for which the protagonist admits optimal
positional strategies, regardless of the opponent. In this work, we
characterize valuations which admit such strategies over infinite game graphs.
Our characterization uses the vocabulary of universal graphs, which has also
proved useful in understanding recent breakthrough results regarding the
complexity of parity games. More precisely, we show that a valuation admitting
universal graphs which are monotone and well-ordered is positional over all
game graphs, and -- more surprisingly -- that the converse is also true for
valuations admitting neutral colors. We prove the applicability and elegance of
the framework by unifying a number of known positionality results, proving new
ones, and establishing closure under lexicographical products. Finally, we
discuss a class of prefix-independent positional objectives which is closed
under countable unions.

future mobility system landscape. Ridepooling services in particular can
decrease land consumption and increase transportation efficiency by increasing
the average vehicle occupancy. Nevertheless, because ridepooling services
require a sufficient user base for pooling to take effect, their performance
can suffer if multiple operators offer such a service and must split the
demand. This study presents a simulation framework for evaluating the impact of
competition and cooperation among multiple ridepooling providers. Two different
kinds of interaction via a broker platform are compared with the base cases of
a single monopolistic operator and two independent operators with divided
demand. In the first, the broker presents trip offers from all operators to
customers (similar to a mobility-as-a-service platform), who can then freely
choose an operator. In the second, a regulated broker platform can manipulate
operator offers with the goal of shifting the customer-operator assignment from
a user equilibrium towards a system optimum. To model adoptions of the service
design depending on the different interaction scenario, a game setting is
introduced. Within alternating turns between operators, operators can adapt
parameters of their service (fleet size and objective function) to maximize
profit. Results for a case study based on Manhattan taxi data, show that
operators generate the highest profit in the broker setting while operating the
largest fleet. Additionally, pooling efficiency can nearly be maintained
compared to a single operator. With the resulting increased service rate, the
regulated competition benefits not only operators (profit) and cities
(increased pooling efficiency), but also customers. Contrarily, when users can
decide freely, the lowest pooling efficiency and operator profit is observed.

maximizing the utility of data containing sensitive information. Due to the
suppression of underrepresented classes that is often required to achieve
privacy, however, it may be in conflict with fairness. We evaluate four DP
synthesizers and present empirical results indicating that three of these

sample of seventeen Galactic hot cores covering three orders of magnitude in
$L_{\rm HDO}$, four orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm

observed values of $L_{\rm HDO}$ for the LMC hot cores fit very well into the
$L_{\rm HDO}$ trends with $L_{\rm bol}$ and metallicity observed toward the

provide a rough estimate of the H$_2$O column density and abundance ranges

is the same as that observed in the Milky Way; the estimated ranges are
systematically lower than Galactic values. The spatial distribution and

magnetic resonance (MR) images in the medical imaging field, as stroke is an
important cerebrovascular disease. Although deep learning-based models have
been proposed for this task, generalizing these models to unseen sites is
difficult due to not only the large inter-site discrepancy among different
scanners, imaging protocols, and populations, but also the variations in stroke
lesion shape, size, and location. To tackle this issue, we introduce a
self-adaptive normalization network, termed SAN-Net, to achieve adaptive
generalization on unseen sites for stroke lesion segmentation. Motivated by
traditional z-score normalization and dynamic network, we devise a masked
adaptive instance normalization (MAIN) to minimize inter-site discrepancies,
which standardizes input MR images from different sites into a site-unrelated
style by dynamically learning affine parameters from the input; \ie, MAIN can
affinely transform the intensity values. Then, we leverage a gradient reversal
layer to force the U-net encoder to learn site-invariant representation with a
site classifier, which further improves the model generalization in conjunction
with MAIN. Finally, inspired by the ``pseudosymmetry'' of the human brain, we
introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation technique, termed
symmetry-inspired data augmentation (SIDA), that can be embedded within SAN-Net
to double the sample size while halving memory consumption. Experimental
results on the benchmark Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS)

under the ``leave-one-site-out'' setting, the proposed SAN-Net outperforms

performances using eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine,
Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting Regressor, CatBoost Regressor,
and their stacked ensemble model using data from both identical and out-of

wavelet decomposition for improving out-of-distribution prediction as
standalone models were unable to generalize very well. Our experimental results
show the best performance of the standalone ensemble model with an accuracy of
96.4%, while the hybrid ensemble model improved it by 1% for in-distribution

different datasets having a distribution shift than the training set. However,
our proposed hybrid model considerably reduces the performance gap between

more biologically realistic neural networks where neurons communicate using

their performance was insufficient for automotive real-world problems, such as
detecting complex objects in an uncontrolled environment. To address this
issue, we took advantage of the latest advancements in matter of spike
backpropagation - surrogate gradient learning, parametric LIF, SpikingJelly

investigate the extent to which the transient part of the stress strain curves

Shear deformations were carried out on glass samples of varying stability,
determined by cooling rate, and at varying strain rates, at a state point deep
in the glass. Density changes up to and exceeding a factor of two were made. We
investigated several different methods for generating isomorphs but none of the
previously developed methods could generate sufficiently precise isomorphs
given the large density changes and non-equilibrium situation. Instead, the
temperatures for these higher densities were chosen to give state points
isomorphic to the starting state point by requiring the steady state flow
stress for isomorphic state points to be invariant in reduced units. In
contrast to the steady state flow stress, we find that the peak stress on the
stress strain curve is not invariant. The peak stress decreases by a few
percent for each ten percent increase in density, although the differences
decrease with increasing density. Analysis of strain profiles and non-affine
motion during the transient phase suggests that the root of the changes in peak
stress is a varying tendency to form shear bands, with the largest tendency
occurring at the lowest densities. We argue that this reflects the effective
steepness of the potential; a higher effective steepness gives a greater
tendency to form shear bands.

Organizing Network (SON) for ensuring proactive management. There are many
existing solutions for internet traffic prediction with higher accuracy using
deep learning. But designing individual predictive models for each service
provider in the network is challenging due to data heterogeneity, scarcity, and
abnormality. Moreover, the performance of the deep sequence model in network
traffic prediction with limited training data has not been studied extensively
in the current works. In this paper, we investigated and evaluated the
performance of the deep transfer learning technique in traffic prediction with
inadequate historical data leveraging the knowledge of our pre-trained model.
First, we used a comparatively larger real-world traffic dataset for source
domain prediction based on five different deep sequence models: Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), LSTM Encoder-Decoder
(LSTM_En_De), LSTM_En_De with Attention layer (LSTM_En_De_Atn), and Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU). Then, two best-performing models, LSTM_En_De and
LSTM_En_De_Atn, from the source domain with an accuracy of 96.06% and 96.05%
are considered for the target domain prediction. Finally, four smaller traffic
datasets collected for four particular sources and destination pairs are used
in the target domain to compare the performance of the standard learning and
transfer learning in terms of accuracy and execution time. According to our
experimental result, transfer learning helps to reduce the execution time for
most cases, while the model's accuracy is improved in transfer learning with a
larger training session.

possibilities is infinite? In a previous study, we used an interval timing
production task and discovered an updating strategy in which the agent adjusted
the behavioral and neuronal noise for exploration. In the experiment, human
subjects proactively generated a series of timed motor outputs. We found that
the sequential motor timing varied at two temporal scales: long-term
correlation around the target interval due to memory drifts and short-term
adjustments of timing variability according to feedback. We have previously
described these features of timing variability with an augmented Gaussian
process, termed reward sensitive Gaussian process (RSGP). Here we provide a
mechanistic model and simulate the process by borrowing the architecture of
recurrent neural networks. While recurrent connection provided the long-term
serial correlation in motor timing, to facilitate reward-driven short-term
variations, we introduced reward-dependent variability in the network
connectivity, inspired by the stochastic nature of synaptic transmission in the
brain. Our model was able to recursively generate an output sequence
incorporating the internal variability and external reinforcement in a Bayesian
framework. We show that the model can learn the key features of human behavior.
Unlike other neural network models that search for unique network connectivity
for the best match between the model prediction and observation, this model can
estimate the uncertainty associated with each outcome and thus did a better job
in teasing apart adjustable task-relevant variability from unexplained
variability. The proposed artificial neural network model parallels the
mechanisms of information processing in neural systems and can extend the
framework of brain-inspired reinforcement learning in continuous state control.

the radius of the capstan. In the same limit, we incorporate frictional
interaction between the rod and the capstan, and compute limiting equilibria of

space is of great benefit for multiple clinical applications. This is often
accomplished by tracking the probe using a precise but expensive optical or
electromagnetic tracking system. Our goal is to develop a simple and low cost
augmented reality echography framework using a standard RGB-D Camera.
  Methods. A prototype system consisting of an Occipital Structure Core RGB-D
camera, a specifically-designed 3D marker, and a fast point cloud registration
algorithm FaVoR was developed and evaluated on an Ultrasonix ultrasound system.
The probe was calibrated on a 3D-printed N-wire phantom using the software PLUS
toolkit. The proposed calibration method is simplified, requiring no additional
markers or sensors attached to the phantom. Also, a visualization software
based on OpenGL was developed for the augmented reality application.
  Results. The calibrated probe was used to augment a real-world video in a
simulated needle insertion scenario. The ultrasound images were rendered on the
video, and visually-coherent results were observed. We evaluated the end-to-end
accuracy of our AR US framework on localizing a cube of 5 cm size. From our two
experiments, the target pose localization error ranges from 5.6 to 5.9 mm and
from -3.9 to 4.2 degrees.
  Conclusion. We believe that with the potential democratization of RGB-D
cameras integrated in mobile devices and AR glasses in the future, our
prototype solution may facilitate the use of 3D freehand ultrasound in clinical
routine. Future work should include a more rigorous and thorough evaluation, by
comparing the calibration accuracy with those obtained by commercial tracking
solutions in both simulated and real medical scenarios.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internet of Things (IoT) is a pivotal technology in application domains that
require connectivity and interoperability between large numbers of devices. IoT
systems predominantly use a software-defined network (SDN) architecture as
their core communication backbone. This architecture offers several advantages,
including the flexibility to make IoT networks self-adaptive through software
programmability. In general, self-adaptation solutions need to periodically
monitor, reason about, and adapt a running system. The adaptation step involves
generating an adaptation strategy and applying it to the running system
whenever an anomaly arises. In this paper, we argue that, rather than
generating individual adaptation strategies, the goal should be to adapt the
logic / code of the running system in such a way that the system itself would
learn how to steer clear of future anomalies, without triggering
self-adaptation too frequently. We instantiate and empirically assess this idea
in the context of IoT networks. Specifically, using genetic programming (GP),
we propose a self-adaptation solution that continuously learns and updates the
control constructs in the data-forwarding logic of SDN-based IoT networks. Our
evaluation, performed using open-source synthetic and industrial data,
indicates that, compared to a baseline adaptation technique that attempts to
generate individual adaptations, our GP-based approach is more effective in
resolving network congestion, and further, reduces the frequency of adaptation
interventions over time. In addition, we compare our approach against a
standard data-forwarding algorithm from the network literature, demonstrating
that our approach significantly reduces packet loss.

is treated via the exact dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) while that of
photon bath is via the Lindblad master equation. Specifically, we explore the
effect of non-Markovian quantum phonon bath on the coherent transfer dynamics
and its manipulation on the current-voltage behavior. Distinguished from the
results of completely Markovian Lindblad equation and those adopting classical
environment description, the mixed DEOM-Lindblad simulations exhibit transfer

might either result in a continuous flow, an intermittent one, or indefinite
interruption of flow, i.e., a clog. While one of the most important (and
obvious) controlling parameters in such a system is the neck-to-particle size
ratio, the role of the liquid driving method is not so obvious. On the one
hand, wide-spread volume-controlled systems result in pressure and local liquid
velocity increases upon eventual clogs. On the other hand, pressure-controlled
systems result in a decrease of the flow through the constriction when a clog
is developed. The root of the question therefore lies on the role of
interparticle liquid flow and hydrodynamic forces on both the formation and
stability of an arch blocking the particle transport through a constriction. In
this work, we experimentally analyse a suspension of non-cohesive particles in
channels undergoing intermittent regimes, in which they are most sensitive to
parametric changes. By exploring the statistical distribution of arrest times
and of discharged particles, we surprisingly find that the transport of
non-cohesive suspensions through constrictions actually follows a ""slower is

computer aided design (CAD) to analysis tools (CAE) and vice versa. Here, one
is faced with a severe incompatibility in geometry representation: While CAD is
usually based on surface representations, analysis mostly relies on volumetric
representations. The forward pass, i.e., converting CAD data to computational
meshes, is well understood and established. However, the same does not hold for
the inverse direction, i.e., CAD reconstruction of deformed geometries
resulting, e.g., from shape optimization. The few reconstruction methods
reported mainly rely on spline fitting, in particular methods that rely on
creating new splines simililar to shape reconstruction from 3D imaging. In
contrast, this paper studies a novel approach that reuses the CAD data given in
the initial design. We show that this concept leads to precise shape
reconstructions while also preserving the initial notion of features defined
during design. Furthermore, reusing the initial CAD representation reduces the
shape reconstruction problem to a shape modification problem. We study this
unique feature and show that it enables the reconstruction of CAD data from
computational meshes by composing each spline in the initial CAD data with a
single, global deformation spline. While post-processing is needed for use in
current CAD software, this novel approach not only allows creating watertight
models, but also enables reconstructing complete CAD models even from
defeatured computational meshes.

essential to improve the forecasts made by deterministic physical models.
Numerous state-of-the-art statistical postprocessing techniques are based on
distributional regression evaluated with the Continuous Ranked Probability
Score (CRPS). However, theoretical properties of such evaluation with the CRPS
have solely considered the unconditional framework (i.e. without covariates)
and infinite sample sizes. We extend these results and study the rate of
convergence in terms of CRPS of distributional regression methods. We find the
optimal minimax rate of convergence for a given class of distributions and show
that the k-nearest neighbor method and the kernel method reach this optimal
minimax rate.

  computational approach",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a disproportionate infection rate
among marginalized and low-income groups. Despite empirical evidence suggesting
that structural inequalities in society contribute to health disparities, there
has been little attempt to offer a computational and theoretical explanation to
establish its plausibility and quantitative impact. This paper combines an
agent-based network model and a compartmental susceptible-infectious-removed
model (SIR) to explain how socioeconomic inequalities affect the dynamics of
disease spreading. Specifically, we focus on two aspects of structural
inequalities: wealth inequality and social segregation. Our computational model
demonstrates that under high income inequality, the infection gap widens
between the low-income and high-income groups, and also the overall infected
cases increase. We also observed that social segregation between different
socioeconomic status (SES) groups intensifies the spreading and hence mortality
rates. Furthermore, we explain the second peak of the infectious cases during a
pandemic as a result of a false sense of safety and loosening the quarantine,
among the higher SES individuals. These findings send a strong message to
policymakers; confinement measures must be accompanied by substantial financial
assistance to those from lower-income groups so that the people regardless of
their socioeconomic status can afford to stay in. Without financial assistance,
lower-income individuals will remain in circulation, which will prolong the
duration and magnitude of the infection.

  Context for Image Captioning","paper accepted in CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Significant progress has been made on visual captioning, largely relying on
pre-trained features and later fixed object detectors that serve as rich inputs
to auto-regressive models. A key limitation of such methods, however, is that
the output of the model is conditioned only on the object detector's outputs.
The assumption that such outputs can represent all necessary information is
unrealistic, especially when the detector is transferred across datasets. In
this work, we reason about the graphical model induced by this assumption, and
propose to add an auxiliary input to represent missing information such as
object relationships. We specifically propose to mine attributes and
relationships from the Visual Genome dataset and condition the captioning model
on them. Crucially, we propose (and show to be important) the use of a
multi-modal pre-trained model (CLIP) to retrieve such contextual descriptions.
Further, object detector models are frozen and do not have sufficient richness
to allow the captioning model to properly ground them. As a result, we propose
to condition both the detector and description outputs on the image, and show
qualitatively and quantitatively that this can improve grounding. We validate
our method on image captioning, perform thorough analyses of each component and
importance of the pre-trained multi-modal model, and demonstrate significant
improvements over the current state of the art, specifically +7.5% in CIDEr and
+1.3% in BLEU-4 metrics.

  Recommendations",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is not accurate to make recommendations only based one single current
session. Therefore, multi-session-based recommendation(MSBR) is a solution for
the problem. Compared with the previous MSBR models, we have made three
improvements in this paper. First, the previous work choose to use all the
history sessions of the user and/or of his similar users. When the user's
current interest changes greatly from the past, most of these sessions can only
have negative impacts. Therefore, we select a large number of randomly chosen
sessions from the dataset as candidate sessions to avoid over depending on
history data. Then we only choose to use the most similar sessions to get the
most useful information while reduce the noise caused by dissimilar sessions.
Second, in real-world datasets, short sessions account for a large proportion.
The RNN often used in previous work is not suitable to process short sessions,
because RNN only focuses on the sequential relationship, which we find is not
the only relationship between items in short sessions. So, we designed a more
suitable method named GAFE based on attention to process short sessions. Third,
Although there are few long sessions, they can not be ignored. Not like
previous models, which simply process long sessions in the same way as short
sessions, we propose LSIS, which can split the interest of long sessions, to
make better use of long sessions. Finally, to help recommendations, we also
have considered users' long-term interests captured by a multi-layer GRU.
Considering the four points above, we built the model ENIREC. Experiments on
two real-world datasets show that the comprehensive performance of ENIREC is
better than other existing models.

These findings are consistent with previous TEM studies of presolar grains from

Our key results are first, that close to the threshold of collapse the global
peak in the curvature appears on the symmetry axis but away from the origin,
indicating that in the limit they will collapse around disjoint centers. This
is confirmed in three of the six families by explicitly finding apparent
horizons around these large curvature peaks. Second, we find evidence neither
for strict discrete-self-similarity nor for universal power-law scaling of

propose a vision-based system that learns to predict the potential motions of
the parts of a variety of articulated objects to guide downstream motion
planning of the system to articulate the objects. To predict the object
motions, we train a neural network to output a dense vector field representing
the point-wise motion direction of the points in the point cloud under
articulation. We then deploy an analytical motion planner based on this vector
field to achieve a policy that yields maximum articulation. We train the vision
system entirely in simulation, and we demonstrate the capability of our system
to generalize to unseen object instances and novel categories in both
simulation and the real world, deploying our policy on a Sawyer robot with no
finetuning. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance
in both simulated and real-world experiments.

the task of transferring the learned knowledge on the labeled source domain to
the unlabeled target domain. Most of the recent papers that address this
problem adopt an offline training setting. More precisely, the training of the
Re-ID model is done assuming that we have access to the complete training
target domain data set. In this paper, we argue that the target domain
generally consists of a stream of data in a practical real-world application,
where data is continuously increasing from the different network's cameras. The
Re-ID solutions are also constrained by confidentiality regulations stating
that the collected data can be stored for only a limited period, hence the
model can no longer get access to previously seen target images. Therefore, we
present a new yet practical online setting for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

of writing, has led to renewed interest in the mathematical modeling of
infectious disease. Recent works have focused on partial differential equation
(PDE) models, particularly reaction-diffusion models, able to describe the
progression of an epidemic in both space and time. These studies have shown
generally promising results in describing and predicting COVID-19 progression.
However, people often travel long distances in short periods of time, leading
to nonlocal transmission of the disease. Such contagion dynamics are not
well-represented by diffusion alone. In contrast, ordinary differential
equation (ODE) models may easily account for this behavior by considering
disparate regions as nodes in a network, with the edges defining nonlocal
transmission. In this work, we attempt to combine these modeling paradigms via
the introduction of a network structure within a reaction-diffusion PDE system.
This is achieved through the definition of a population-transfer operator,
which couples disjoint and potentially distant geographic regions, facilitating
nonlocal population movement between them. We provide analytical results
demonstrating that this operator does not disrupt the physical consistency or
mathematical well-posedness of the system, and verify these results through
numerical experiments. We then use this technique to simulate the COVID-19
epidemic in the Brazilian region of Rio de Janeiro, showcasing its ability to
capture important nonlocal behaviors, while maintaining the advantages of a
reaction-diffusion model for describing local dynamics.

thermoEMF of a single-crystal material with a low scattering index. As a
consequence, a significant increase in the thermoEMF and, hence, in the
thermoelectric figure of merit of TEM in going to powder materials, especially
in the case of degenerate electron gas, can be expected only if dielectric or
vacuum barriers between powder particles do not lead to a significant decrease

$\zeta$-function or more generally into an L-function. These packaging
functions have symmetries and properties not at all apparent from the energies
or the primes themselves, often exhibiting scaling symmetries for example. One
might be able to understand those symmetries and compute the packaging function
independently of the actual packaging. And so one finds a way of putting
together objects into a package, and ways of discerning symmetries of that
package independent of the actual mode of packaging. This is a recurrent theme
of the Langlands Program as well. Packaging is also found in Weyl's asymptotics
and ""hearing the shape of a drum"" (Kac), the Schwinger Greens function in
quantum electrodynamics packaging the Feynman sum of histories, and more
generally in the Selberg trace formula.

classification and mapping that can constrain research and stewardship efforts.
In the US Northeast, emergence of low-statured woody vegetation, or shrublands,
instead of secondary forests in post-agricultural landscapes is well-documented
by field studies, but poorly understood from a landscape perspective, which
limits the ability to systematically study and manage these lands. To address
gaps in classification/mapping of low-statured cover types where they have been
historically rare, we developed models to predict shrubland distributions at
30m resolution across New York State (NYS), using a stacked ensemble combining
a random forest, gradient boosting machine, and artificial neural network to
integrate remote sensing of structural (airborne LIDAR) and optical (satellite
imagery) properties of vegetation cover. We first classified a 1m canopy height
model (CHM), derived from a patchwork of available LIDAR coverages, to define
shrubland presence/absence. Next, these non-contiguous maps were used to train
a model ensemble based on temporally-segmented imagery to predict shrubland
probability for the entire study landscape (NYS). Approximately 2.5% of the CHM
coverage area was classified as shrubland. Models using Landsat predictors
trained on the classified CHM were effective at identifying shrubland (test set
AUC=0.893, real-world AUC=0.904), in discriminating between shrub/young forest
and other cover classes, and produced qualitatively sensible maps, even when
extending beyond the original training data. Our results suggest that
incorporation of airborne LiDAR, even from a discontinuous patchwork of
coverages, can improve land cover classification of historically rare but
increasingly prevalent shrubland habitats across broader areas.

target of the theorem would be the very possibility to conceive quantum theory
as a theory concerning 'real' stuff in the world out-there. I present here a
historico-critical analysis of the stages, between 1963 and 1978, through which
the locality condition of the original Bell theorem almost undiscernibly turned
into a 'local realism' condition, a circumstance which too often has affected
the analysis of how serious the consequences of the Bell theorem turn out to
be. In particular, the analysis puts into focus the interpretive oscillations

presents a dataset-driven design and performance evaluation of a machine

the dataset suggests that it suffers from class representation imbalance and
class overlap in the feature space. We employed ensemble methods using Balanced
Bagging (BB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest empowered
by Hellinger Distance Decision Tree (RF-HDDT). BB and XGBoost are tuned to
handle the imbalanced data, and Random Forest (RF) classifier is supplemented
by the Hellinger metric to address the imbalance issue. Two new algorithms are
proposed to address the class overlap issue in the dataset. These two
algorithms are leveraged to help improve the performance of the testing dataset
by modifying the final classification decision made by three base classifiers
as part of the ensemble classifier which employs a majority vote combiner. The
proposed design is evaluated for both binary and multi-category classification.
Comparing the proposed model to those reported on the same dataset in the
literature demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms others by a
significant margin for both binary and multi-category classification cases.

of negative impacts in the real world sensitive applications for which machine

look visually the same to human beings but the machine learning models are
fooled by such inputs. In this report I discuss 2 novel ways to counter the

  heterogeneous multiprocessor systems under memory constraints",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computing workflows in heterogeneous multiprocessor systems are frequently
modeled as directed acyclic graphs of tasks and data blocks, which represent
computational modules and their dependencies in the form of data produced by a
task and used by others. However, for some workflows, such as the task schedule
in a digital signal processor may run out of memory by exposing too much
parallelism. This paper focuses on the data allocation and task scheduling
problem under memory constraints, and concentrates on shared memory platforms.
We first propose an integer linear programming model to formulate the problem.
Then we consider the problem as an extended flexible job shop scheduling
problem, while trying to minimize the critical path of the graph. To solve this
problem, we propose a tabu search algorithm (TS) which combines several
distinguished features such as a greedy initial solution construction method
and a mixed neighborhood evaluation strategy based on exact evaluation and
approximate evaluation methods. Experimental results on randomly generated
instances show that the the proposed TS algorithm can obtain relatively
high-quality solutions in a reasonable computational time. In specific, the
tabu search method averagely improves the makespan by 5-25\% compared to the
classical load balancing algorithm that are widely used in the literature.
Besides, some key features of TS are also analyzed to identify its success
factors.

  Documents",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the Relation Extraction task in documents by
benchmarking two different neural network models: a multi-modal language model
(LayoutXLM) and a Graph Neural Network: Edge Convolution Network (ECN). For
this benchmark, we use the XFUND dataset, released along with LayoutXLM. While
both models reach similar results, they both exhibit very different
characteristics. This raises the question on how to integrate various
modalities in a neural network: by merging all modalities thanks to additional
pretraining (LayoutXLM), or in a cascaded way (ECN). We conclude by discussing
some methodological issues that must be considered for new datasets and task
definition in the domain of Information Extraction with complex documents.

platforms, ranging from small drones to big satellites, and being applied in a
variety of diverse scenarios, ranging from fixed terrestrial links to moving
platforms in general, and operating within a wide range of conditions and
distances, the Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications
Technology (NICT) is currently working towards the development of a series of
versatile miniaturized free-space laser-communication terminals. By choosing
the appropriate terminal configuration for any given scenario, the basic
conditions of operations can be satisfied without the need of customization,
and the adaptive design of the terminals can close the gap to achieve an
optimum solution that meets the communication requirements. This paper presents
NICT's current efforts regarding the development of this series of lasercom
terminals and introduces the first prototypes developed for validation and test
purposes.
