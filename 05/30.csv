  structural functions","This manuscript is accepted by ICASSP 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Conventional music structure analysis algorithms aim to divide a song into
segments and to group them with abstract labels (e.g., 'A', 'B', and 'C').
However, explicitly identifying the function of each segment (e.g., 'verse' or
'chorus') is rarely attempted, but has many applications. We introduce a
multi-task deep learning framework to model these structural semantic labels
directly from audio by estimating ""verseness,"" ""chorusness,"" and so forth, as a
function of time. We propose a 7-class taxonomy (i.e., intro, verse, chorus,
bridge, outro, instrumental, and silence) and provide rules to consolidate
annotations from four disparate datasets. We also propose to use a
spectral-temporal Transformer-based model, called SpecTNT, which can be trained
with an additional connectionist temporal localization (CTL) loss. In
cross-dataset evaluations using four public datasets, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the SpecTNT model and CTL loss, and obtain strong results
overall: the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art chorus-detection and
boundary-detection methods at detecting choruses and boundaries, respectively.

shown its versatility not only in natural language processing but also in music

Transformer-based approach to tackle beat and downbeat tracking. This approach
employs SpecTNT (Spectral-Temporal Transformer in Transformer), a variant of
Transformer that models both spectral and temporal dimensions of a
time-frequency input of music audio. A SpecTNT model uses a stack of blocks,
where each consists of two levels of Transformer encoders. The lower-level (or
spectral) encoder handles the spectral features and enables the model to pay
attention to harmonic components of each frame. Since downbeats indicate bar
boundaries and are often accompanied by harmonic changes, this step may help
downbeat modeling. The upper-level (or temporal) encoder aggregates useful
local spectral information to pay attention to beat/downbeat positions. We also
propose an architecture that combines SpecTNT with a state-of-the-art model,
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), to further improve the performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly
outperform TCN in downbeat tracking while maintaining comparable result in beat
tracking.

us to study theoretically and numerically the scattering by objects made of

  In this work, the field scattered by the cluster of the particles and its

properties. One prominent such technique is that of $N$-decompositions of
Conlon--Lee, which uses weakly H\""{o}lder (or weakly norming) bigraphs as

may struggle to utilize atypical instances by rote during fully-supervised
training or overfit shallow patterns with low-shot data. To alleviate such
limitations, we develop RetroPrompt with the motivation of decoupling knowledge
from memorization to help the model strike a balance between generalization and
memorization. In contrast with vanilla prompt learning, RetroPrompt constructs
an open-book knowledge-store from training instances and implements a retrieval
mechanism during the process of input, training and inference, thus equipping
the model with the ability to retrieve related contexts from the training
corpus as cues for enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RetroPrompt can obtain better performance in both few-shot and zero-shot

yield better generalization abilities with new datasets. Detailed analysis of
memorization indeed reveals RetroPrompt can reduce the reliance of language
models on memorization; thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks.

a low amplitude quiescent state, and the power-law rise to a steady-state over

so its height determines the nature of processes in the atmosphere and depends

decrease in the vertical temperature gradient in a layer above 5 km and at
least 2 km thick. Consequently, the uncertainty in determining the height of
the section between the troposphere and the stratosphere is 2 km or more. In
addition, the temperature profile changes due to the influence of many reasons,
so sometimes the height of the tropopause cannot even be determined. The
optical properties of air in the troposphere and stratosphere differ, which
makes it possible to measure the height of the section with high accuracy using
a radiosonde with an optical sensor. The launches of radiosondes with optical
sensors made it possible to measure the height of the tropopause by changing
the attenuation coefficient of visible light. It turned out that the lower edge
of the tropopause corresponds to a sharp change in the attenuation coefficient.
The repeatability of the results was confirmed by the simultaneous launch of
radiosondes. The results of the work will be useful for the tasks of weather

make these clustering decisions. When any problem arises in accessing
up-to-date and accurate CSI, user clustering will not properly function due to
its hard-dependency on CSI, and obviously, this will negatively affect the
robustness of the NOMA systems. To improve the robustness of the NOMA systems,
we propose to utilize emerging trends such as location-aware and
camera-equipped base stations (CBSs) which do not require any extra radio
frequency resource consumption. Specifically, we explore three different
dimensions of feedback that a CBS can benefit from to solve the user clustering
problem, namely CSI-based feedback and non-CSI-based feedback, comprised of
user equipment (UE) location and the CBS camera feed. We first investigate how
the vision assistance of a CBS can be used in conjunction with other dimensions
of feedback to make clustering decisions in various scenarios. Later, we
provide a simple user case study to illustrate how to implement vision-assisted
user clustering in mmWave-NOMA systems to improve robustness, in which a deep
learning (DL) beam selection algorithm is trained on the images captured by the
CBS to perform NOMA clustering. We demonstrate that user clustering without CSI

to more accurately model a significant medical process, kidney exchange, and
several other applications. Up until now the Stochastic Matching problem that
has been studied was as follows: given a graph G = (V, E), each edge is
included in the realized sub-graph of G mutually independently with probability
p_e, and the goal is to find a degree-bounded sub-graph Q of G that has an
expected maximum matching that approximates the expected maximum matching of
the realized sub-graph. This model does not account for possibilities of vertex
dropouts, which can be found in several applications, e.g. in kidney exchange
when donors or patients opt out of the exchange process as well as in online
freelancing and online dating when online profiles are found to be faked. Thus,
we will study a more generalized model of Stochastic Matching in which vertices
and edges are both realized independently with some probabilities p_v, p_e,
respectively, which more accurately fits important applications than the
previously studied model.
  We will discuss the first algorithms and analysis for this generalization of
the Stochastic Matching model and prove that they achieve good approximation
ratios. In particular, we show that the approximation factor of a natural
algorithm for this problem is at least $0.6568$ in unweighted graphs, and $1/2

improve our result for unweighted graphs to $2/3$ using edge degree constrained

complexity [OPS19], cryptography [LP20], average-case complexity [Hir21], and
proof search [Kra22] have been discovered in recent years. Since the running
time of algorithms is a key resource in these fields, it is crucial in the
corresponding arguments to consider time-bounded variants of Kolmogorov
complexity. While fruitful interactions between time-bounded Kolmogorov
complexity and different areas of theoretical computer science have been known
for quite a while (e.g., [Sip83, Ko91, ABK+06, AF09], to name a few), the
aforementioned results have led to a renewed interest in this topic.
  The theory of Kolmogorov complexity is well understood, but many useful
results and properties of Kolmogorov complexity are not known to hold in
time-bounded settings. This creates technical difficulties or leads to
conditional results when applying methods from time-bounded Kolmogorov
complexity to algorithms and complexity theory. Perhaps even more importantly,
in many cases it is necessary to consider randomised algorithms. Since random
strings have high complexity, the classical theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov
complexity might be inappropriate in such contexts.
  To mitigate these issues and develop a theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov
complexity that survives in the setting of randomised computations, some recent
papers [Oli19, LO21, LOS21, GKLO22, LOZ22] have explored probabilistic notions
of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, such as $\mathsf{rKt}$ complexity
[Oli19], $\mathsf{rK}^t$ complexity [LOS21], and $\mathsf{pK}^t$ complexity
[GKLO22]. These measures consider different ways of encoding an object via a
probabilistic representation. In this survey, we provide an introduction to

consistent equations of motion, the Dirac-Bergmann formalism imposes some set
of constraints which contribute to the total Hamiltonian along with their

in depth look at those observational constraints, particularly at their nuances
and uncertainties. Despite their varied origins, the standard PBH formation
path is assumed to be collapse of perturbations after inflation, which should
leave signals visible in the CMB at certain scales. Other constraints come from
microlensing surveys, which severely limit PBHs as dark matter in the solar to
satellite range, but there are diminishing results in regards to lower mass
ranges. Gravitational waves signals and PBH evaporation from Hawking radiation
also make for useful probes, but the former requires the next generation of
experiments before making constraints beyond the solar mass range, and the
later is severely limited above $10^{-16} \rm M_{\odot}$. Other dynamical and
accretion constraints exist for PBH of large masses. Care also has to be given,
as all these constraints can carry different implications coming from
differences between monochromatic and extended mass distributions, and their
degree of clustering. Beyond all these issues, a window still exists for
primordial black holes to be all of the dark matter between $10^{-16}$ and
$10^{-11} \rm M_{\odot}$

varies with cardiac performance, their speed (pulse wave velocity; PWV) depends
on arterial stiffness and their reflection is affected by conduit artery tone.
Here we demonstrate a novel method for non-invasively assessing wave
properties. The analysis was based on changes in blood flow velocity and
arterial wall diameter during the cardiac cycle. Velocity and diameter were
determined by tracking the movement of speckles in successive B-mode ultrasound
images acquired at high temporal frequency with an ultrafast plane-wave
scanner. Blood speckle was detected in the absence of contrast agents by using
singular value decomposition, and it was processed by cross-correlation
techniques that correct biases in ultrasound imaging velocimetry. Results
obtained in the rabbit aorta were compared with a conventional analysis based
on blood velocity and pressure, employing measurements obtained with an
intra-arterial catheter. The catheter-based measurements had a poorer frequency
response and greater lags but patterns of forward and backward travelling waves
were consistent between the conventional and new methods. Errors in PWV were
also similar in magnitude, although opposite in direction. Comparable
reductions in wave intensity and delays in wave arrival were detected by the
two methods when ventricular dysfunction was induced pharmacologically. The
non-invasive method was applied to the carotid artery of a healthy human
subject and gave a PWV and patterns of wave intensity that were consistent with
earlier measurements. The new system may have clinical utility, for example in
screening for, and monitoring of, heart failure.

present both experimental and weakly non-linear modelling to examine this
instability mechanism, in which a primary wave beam generates two secondary
wave beams of lower frequencies and shorter length scales. Through a versatile
experimental set-up, we examine how this instability develops over hundreds of
buoyancy periods. Unlike predictions from previous zero-dimensional weakly
non-linear theory, we find that the approach to a saturated equilibrium state
for the triadic interactions is not monotonic; rather, the amplitudes and
structures of the constituent beams continue to modulate without ever reaching
a steady equilibrium. To understand this behaviour we develop a weakly
non-linear approach to account for the spatio-temporal evolution of the
amplitudes and structures of the beams over slow time-scales and long
distances, and explore the consequences using a numerical scheme. Through this
approach, we establish that the evolution of the instability is remarkably
sensitive to the spatio-temporal triadic configuration for the system and how
part of the observed modulations can be attributed to a competition between the
linear growth rate of the secondary wave beams and the finite residence time of
the triadic perturbations within the underlying primary beam.

  Methods. We use the results of an unsupervised clustering algorithm to
distinguish 11 subclasses of VIPERS galaxies based on the multi-dimensional
feature space defined by rest-frame UV to NIR colours presented in Siudek et al
(2018a). We investigate the relationship between the properties of these

density contrast derived from the 5th nearest neighbour technique.
  Results. We confirm that the galaxy population-density relation is already in
place at z ~ 0.9, with the blue galaxy fraction decreasing with density,
compensated by an increase of the red fraction. On average red galaxies in the
high-density environment are larger by 28% than the ones in low-density
environments. In particular, we find one group of galaxies, subclass C3, whose
increase of size with time can be explained mainly as the result of mergers;
for other red subclasses, mergers would not seem to play a major role (subclass
C2) or play a negligible role (subclass C1). The properties of the green
galaxies (subclasses C4-6) depend on whether their stellar mass is above or
below a transition mass. Low-mass green galaxies appear to have grown through
secular processes, while in high-mass green galaxies mass assembly appears to
be dominated by mergers. When it comes to blue galaxies, the trend of
decreasing fraction with denser environments seen for the group as a whole
(subclasses C7-11) is found to be driven mostly by one group of galaxies,
subclass C10. These are compact low-mass galaxies with high sSFRs, that are
preferentially found in low-density environments.

any other form of participation. The aim of the manuscript is twofold: first,
to offer a detailed and comprehensive statistical description of Code Week's
participation in the EU Member States in terms of penetration, retention,
demographic composition, and spatial distribution in order to inform more
effective awareness-raising campaigns; second, to investigate the impact of
socio-economic factors on Code Week involvement. The study identifies a strong

and caused millions of deaths all over the world. The rapid spread of the
virus, with its early-stage exponential growth and subsequent 'waves', caught
many medical professionals and decision-makers unprepared. Even though
epidemiological models have been known for almost a century (since the 'Spanish
Influenza' pandemic of 1918-20), the real-life spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
often confounded the modelers. While the general framework of epidemiological
models like SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) or SIR
(susceptible-exposed-infected) was not in question, the behavior of model
parameters turned out to be unpredictable and complicated. In particular, while
the 'basic' reproduction number, R0, can be considered a constant (for the
original SARS-CoV-2 virus, prior to the emergence of variants, R0 is between
2.5 and 3.0), the 'effective' reproduction number, R(t), was a complex function
of time, influenced by human behavior in response to the pandemic (e.g.,
masking, lockdowns, transition to remote work, etc.) To better understand these
phenomena, we model the first year of the pandemic (between February 2020 and
February 2021) for a number of localities (fifty US states, as well as several
countries) using a simple SIR model. We show that the evolution of the pandemic
can be described quite successfully by assuming that R(t) behaves in a
'viscoelastic' manner, as a sum of two or three 'damped oscillators' with
different natural frequencies and damping coefficients. These oscillators
likely correspond to different sub-populations having different reactions to
proposed mitigation measures. The proposed approach can offer future data
modelers new ways to fit the reproduction number evolution with time (as
compared to the purely data-driven approaches most prevalent today).

expressions plays a critical role in healthcare analytics. Effective synthesis
for expressions using given characteristics can make great contributions to
health risk management and medical decision-making. For example, predicting the
resulting physiological symptoms on patients from given treatment
characteristics is helpful for the disease prevention and personalized
treatment strategy design. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
effectively synthesize the expressions based on given characteristics. However,
the mapping from characteristics to expressions is usually from a relatively
low dimension space to a high dimension space, but most of the existing methods
such as regression models could not effectively handle such mapping. Besides,
the relationship between characteristics and expressions may contain not only
deterministic patterns, but also stochastic patterns. To address these
challenges, this paper proposed a novel selective ensemble
characteristic-to-expression synthesis (SE-CTES) approach inspired by
generative adversarial network (GAN). The novelty of the proposed method can be
summarized into three aspects: (1) GAN-based architecture for deep neural
networks are incorporated to learn the relatively low dimensional mapping to
high dimensional mapping containing both deterministic and stochastic patterns;
(2) the weights of the two mismatching errors in the GAN-based architecture are
proposed to be different to reduce the learning bias in the training process;
and (3) a selective ensemble learning framework is proposed to reduce the
prediction bias and improve the synthesis stability. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive numerical simulation studies
and a real-world healthcare case study were applied and the results
demonstrated that the proposed method is very promising.

properties. However, in contrast to direct bandgap TMDs monolayers, bulk
samples have an indirect bandgap that restricts their application as light
emitters. On the other hand, the high refractive index of these materials seems
ideal for creating high-quality nanophotonic resonators with a strong Purcell
effect. In this work, we fabricate Whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators
from bulk (i.e., indirect bandgap) MoSe$_2$ using resistless scanning probe
lithography and study their optical properties.
Micro-photoluminescence($\mu$-PL) investigation revealed WGM spectra of
resonators with an enhancement factor of 100 compared to pristine flake.
Scattering experiments and modeling also confirm the WGM nature of spectra
observed. Temperature dependence of PL revealed two components of
photoluminescence. The first one quenches with decreasing temperature, the
second one does not and becomes dominant. Therefore, this suggests that
resonators amplify both direct and temperature-activated indirect PL. Thus,
here we demonstrated the novel approach to fabricating nanophotonic resonators
from bulk TMDs and obtaining PL from indirect bandgap materials. We believe
that the suggested approach and structures have great prospects in
nanophotonics.

  Ransomware Attacks",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ransomware attacks are increasing at an alarming rate, leading to large
financial losses, unrecoverable encrypted data, data leakage, and privacy
concerns. The prompt detection of ransomware attacks is required to minimize
further damage, particularly during the encryption stage. However, the
frequency and structure of the observed ransomware attack data makes this task
difficult to accomplish in practice. The data corresponding to ransomware
attacks represents temporal, high-dimensional sparse signals, with limited
records and very imbalanced classes. While traditional deep learning models
have been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of
domains, Bayesian Neural Networks, which are a class of probabilistic models,
are better suited to the issues of the ransomware data. These models combine
ideas from Bayesian statistics with the rich expressive power of neural
networks. In this paper, we propose the Radial Spike and Slab Bayesian Neural
Network, which is a new type of Bayesian Neural network that includes a new
form of the approximate posterior distribution. The model scales well to large
architectures and recovers the sparse structure of target functions. We provide
a theoretical justification for using this type of distribution, as well as a
computationally efficient method to perform variational inference. We
demonstrate the performance of our model on a real dataset of ransomware
attacks and show improvement over a large number of baselines, including
state-of-the-art models such as Neural ODEs (ordinary differential equations).
In addition, we propose to represent low-level events as MITRE ATT\&CK tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) which allows the model to better generalize
to unseen ransomware attacks.

flexible tensile elements (e.g., cables), have a variety of advantages,

Nevertheless, the hybrid soft-rigid nature of these robots also complicates the
ability to localize and track their state. This work aims to address what has
been recognized as a grand challenge in this domain, i.e., the state estimation
of tensegrity robots through a markerless, vision-based method, as well as
novel, onboard sensors that can measure the length of the robot's cables. In
particular, an iterative optimization process is proposed to track the 6-DoF
pose of each rigid element of a tensegrity robot from an RGB-D video as well as
endcap distance measurements from the cable sensors. To ensure that the pose
estimates of rigid elements are physically feasible, i.e., they are not
resulting in collisions between rods or with the environment, physical
constraints are introduced during the optimization. Real-world experiments are
performed with a 3-bar tensegrity robot, which performs locomotion gaits. Given
ground truth data from a motion capture system, the proposed method achieves
less than 1~cm translation error and 3 degrees rotation error, which
significantly outperforms alternatives. At the same time, the approach can
provide accurate pose estimation throughout the robot's motion, while motion
capture often fails due to occlusions.

nonexistence of saddle connections. As an application we show that the result

current data releases from the \textit{Gaia} space mission places a robust
upper limit on the ejection rate of HVSs from the GC of $3\times10^{-2} \,

considering the absence of post main sequence HVSs in \textit{Gaia} Early Data

before it is needed by a program. Prefetching relies on accurate memory access
prediction, to which task machine learning based methods are increasingly
applied. Unlike previous approaches that learn from deltas or offsets and
perform one access prediction, we develop TransforMAP, based on the powerful
Transformer model, that can learn from the whole address space and perform
multiple cache line predictions. We propose to use the binary of memory
addresses as model input, which avoids information loss and saves a token table
in hardware. We design a block index bitmap to collect unordered future page
offsets under the current page address as learning labels. As a result, our
model can learn temporal patterns as well as spatial patterns within a page. In
a practical implementation, this approach has the potential to hide prediction
latency because it prefetches multiple cache lines likely to be used in a long
horizon. We show that our approach achieves 35.67% MPKI improvement and 20.55%
IPC improvement in simulation, higher than state-of-the-art Best-Offset
prefetcher and ISB prefetcher.

  Distribution of the Attributes","11 pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Naive-Bayes classifier is widely used due to its simplicity, speed and
accuracy. However this approach fails when, for at least one attribute value in
a test sample, there are no corresponding training samples with that attribute
value. This is known as the zero frequency problem and is typically addressed
using Laplace Smoothing. However, Laplace Smoothing does not take into account
the statistical characteristics of the neighbourhood of the attribute values of
the test sample. Gaussian Naive Bayes addresses this but the resulting Gaussian
model is formed from global information. We instead propose an approach that
estimates conditional probabilities using information in the neighbourhood of
the test sample. In this case we no longer need to make the assumption of
independence of attribute values and hence consider the joint probability
distribution conditioned on the given class which means our approach (unlike
the Gaussian and Laplace approaches) takes into consideration dependencies
among the attribute values. We illustrate the performance of the proposed
approach on a wide range of datasets taken from the University of California at
Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. We also include results for the
$k$-NN classifier and demonstrate that the proposed approach is simple, robust

$k$ gets infected as soon as the number of its infected neighbors exceeds $k$.
This process has been studied extensively in so called \textit{rank one}

class of random graphs of unbounded rank which allow for extensive clustering.
Our main result determines the final fraction of infected vertices as the fixed
point of a non-linear operator defined on a suitable function space. We propose
an algorithm that facilitates neural networks to calculate this fixed point
efficiently. We further derive criteria based on the Fr\'echet derivative of
the operator that allows one to determine whether small infections spread

randomly interact pairwise over a weighted graph with two communities. Edges
within a community have identical weights different from edge weights between
communities. We first derive an upper bound for the second moment of agent
opinions. Using this bound, we obtain upper bounds for probability that a large
portion of agents have opinions close to average ones. The results imply a
phase transition of transient behavior of the process: When edge weights within
communities are larger than those between communities and those between regular
and stubborn agents, most agents in the same community hold opinions close to
the average opinion of that community with large probability, at an early stage
of the process. However, if the difference between intra- and inter-community
weights is small, most of the agents instead hold opinions close to everyone's
average opinion at the early stage. In contrast, when the influence of stubborn
agents is large, agent opinions settle quickly to steady state. We then conduct
numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results. Different from
traditional asymptotic analysis in most opinion dynamics literature, the paper
characterizes the influences of stubborn agents and community structure on the
initial phase of the opinion evolution.

broad applicability and theoretical interest. Here we address questions of the
geometrical role that a scaffolding of fixed particles plays in tuning the
threshold volume fraction and force network in the vicinity of jamming. Our 2d
simulated system consists of soft particles and fixed ""pins"", both of which
harmonically repel overlaps. On one hand, we find that many of the critical
scalings associated with jamming in the absence of pins continue to hold in the
presence of even dense pin latices. On the other hand, the presence of pins
lowers the jamming threshold, in a universal way at low pin densities and a
geometry-dependent manner at high pin densities, producing packings with lower
densities and fewer contacts between particles. The onset of strong lattice
dependence coincides with the development of bond-orientational order.
Furthermore, the presence of pins dramatically modifies the network of forces,
with both unusually weak and unusually strong forces becoming more abundant.
The spatial organization of this force network depends on pin geometry and is
described in detail. Using persistent homology we demonstrate that pins modify
the topology of the network. Finally, we observe clear signatures of this
developing bond-orientational order and broad force distribution in the elastic
moduli which characterize the linear response of these packings to strain.

sensitivity achievable via deep radio observations with the most sensitive
radio arrays currently in operation. Hence, we now have the opportunity to
probe the radio re-brightening that some models predict, should emerge at late

interstellar medium. Here we present the latest results from our deep radio
observations of the GW170817 field with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array

compelling evidence for emission in excess to the tail of the jet afterglow
($<3.3\,\mu$Jy), confirming our previous results. We thus set new constraints
on the dynamical ejecta afterglow models. These constraints favor single-speed
ejecta with energy $\lesssim 10^{50}\,$erg (for an ejecta speed of
$\beta_0=0.5$), or steeper energy-speed distributions of the kilonova ejecta.
Our results also suggest larger values of the cold, non-rotating maximum NS

corresponds to random walk. During 200 hours of static measurement of gravity,
the atomic gravimeter using Kalman filter demonstrates a sensitivity as good as
0.6 $\rm{nm/s^2}/\sqrt{\rm{s}}$, and highlights a precision of 1.7
$\rm{nm/s^2}$ at the measuring time of a single sample. The measurement noise
achieved is also lower than the quantum projection limit below $\sim$ 30 s.

equations. The recently proposed sparse modeling approach is based on the fact
that the Green's function has less information than its spectral function and
hence is compressible without loss of relevant information. With the use of the
so-called intermediate representation of the Green's function in the sparse
modeling approach, one can solve the gap equation with only 10-100 sampled
Matsubara Green's functions, while the conventional quasiclassical theory needs
100-1000 ones. We show the efficiency of our method in bulk and vortex states,
by self-consistently solving the Eilenberger equations and gap equations. We

of a phase transition at 4.1K is observed in heat capacity, resistivity, and

large anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility was observed, with the c-axis

highly suggestive of uniaxial ferromagnetism, and the large size of

inflation, in the very early universe, can produce PGWs, which leave an imprint
on the CMB in form of odd parity $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we study
the performance of the component separation and parameter estimation pipelines
in context of constraining the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Based on
the simulated data for one observation season, we compare five different
pipelines with different working principles. Three pipelines perform component
separation at map or spectra level before estimating $r$ from the cleaned
spectra, while the other two pipelines performs a global fit for both
foreground parameters and $r$. We also test different methods to account for
the effects of time stream filtering systematics. This work shows that our
pipelines provide consistent and robust constraints on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio and a consistent sensitivity $\sigma(r) \sim 0.02$. This showcases the
potential of precise $B$-mode polarization measurement with AliCPT-1. AliCPT
will provide a powerful opportunity to detect PGWs, which is complementary with
various ground-based CMB experiments in the southern hemisphere.

and virtual realities. As it is expensive to record binaural audio from the
real world, synthesizing them from mono audio has attracted increasing
attention. This synthesis process involves not only the basic physical warping
of the mono audio, but also room reverberations and head/ear related
filtrations, which, however, are difficult to accurately simulate in
traditional digital signal processing. In this paper, we formulate the
synthesis process from a different perspective by decomposing the binaural
audio into a common part that shared by the left and right channels as well as
a specific part that differs in each channel. Accordingly, we propose
BinauralGrad, a novel two-stage framework equipped with diffusion models to
synthesize them respectively. Specifically, in the first stage, the common
information of the binaural audio is generated with a single-channel diffusion
model conditioned on the mono audio, based on which the binaural audio is
generated by a two-channel diffusion model in the second stage. Combining this
novel perspective of two-stage synthesis with advanced generative models (i.e.,
the diffusion models),the proposed BinauralGrad is able to generate accurate
and high-fidelity binaural audio samples. Experiment results show that on a
benchmark dataset, BinauralGrad outperforms the existing baselines by a large
margin in terms of both object and subject evaluation metrics (Wave L2: 0.128

the density shape of the Galactic stellar halo using 11624 K giants from the
LAMOST survey. Every star is assigned a probability of being a member of the
GSE based on its spherical velocities and metallicity by a Gaussian Mixture
Model. We divide the stellar halo into two parts by the obtained probabilities,
of which one is composed of the GSE members and defined as the GSE-related
halo, and the other one is referred to as the GSE-removed halo. Using a
non-parametric method, the radial number density profiles of the two stellar
halos can be well described by a single power law with a variable flattening
$q$ ($r = \sqrt{R^2+[(Z/q(r))]^2}, \nu = {\nu_0}r^{-\alpha}$). The index
$\alpha$ is $4.92\pm0.12$ for the GSE-related halo and $4.25\pm0.14$ for the
GSE-removed halo. Both the two stellar halos are vertically flattened at
smaller radii but become more spherical at larger radii. We find that the
GSE-related halo is less vertically flattened than the GSE-removed halo, and
the difference of $q$ between the two stellar halos ranges from 0.07 to 0.15.
However, after the consideration of the bias, it is thought to be within 0.08
at most of the radii. Finally, we compare our results with two Milky Way
analogues which experience a significant major merger in the TNG50 simulation.

  Our main contribution is a fast $(1+\varepsilon)$ distance oracle for any

norms as special cases, as well as other norms used in practice, e.g. top-$k$

the box-norm. We propose a novel data structure with $\tilde{O}(n (d +

|S| \cdot \mathrm{mmc}(l)^2)$ query time, for computing distances to a subset
$S$ of data points, where $\mathrm{mmc}(l)$ is a complexity-measure
(concentration modulus) of the symmetric norm. When $l = \ell_{p}$ , this
runtime matches the aforementioned state-of-art oracles.

energy functions, are receiving increasing attention due to their ability to
learn complex distributions. To train deep EBMs, the maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with short-run Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is often used. While
the MLE with short-run LMC is computationally efficient compared to an MLE with
full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), it often assigns high density to
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address this issue, here we systematically
investigate why the MLE with short-run LMC can converge to EBMs with wrong
density estimates, and reveal that the heuristic modifications to LMC
introduced by previous works were the main problem. We then propose a Uniform
Support Partitioning (USP) scheme that optimizes a set of points to evenly
partition the support of the EBM and then uses the resulting points to
approximate the EBM-MLE loss gradient. We empirically demonstrate that USP
avoids the pitfalls of short-run LMC, leading to significantly improved OOD

the student network that has the same width as the teacher network and is

generally, linear estimators), including neural tangent kernel approach, random
feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal

Despite widespread use in applications, the approximation property of (G)CNNs
has not been well investigated. The universality of (G)CNNs has been shown
since the late 2010s. Yet, our understanding on how (G)CNNs represent functions
is incomplete because the past universality theorems have been shown in a
case-by-case manner by manually/carefully assigning the network parameters
depending on the variety of convolution layers, and in an indirect manner by
converting/modifying the (G)CNNs into other universal approximators such as
invariant polynomials and fully-connected networks. In this study, we formulate
a versatile depth-2 continuous GCNN $S[\gamma]$ as a nonlinear mapping between
group representations, and directly obtain an analysis operator, called the
ridgelet trasform, that maps a given function $f$ to the network parameter
$\gamma$ so that $S[\gamma]=f$. The proposed GCNN covers typical GCNNs such as
the cyclic convolution on multi-channel images, networks on
permutation-invariant inputs (Deep Sets), and $\mathrm{E}(n)$-equivariant
networks. The closed-form expression of the ridgelet transform can describe how
the network parameters are organized to represent a function. While it has been
known only for fully-connected networks, this study is the first to obtain the
ridgelet transform for GCNNs. By discretizing the closed-form expression, we
can systematically generate a constructive proof of the $cc$-universality of
finite GCNNs. In other words, our universality proofs are more unified and
constructive than previous proofs.

effective remedy is adversarial weight perturbation, which injects the
worst-case weight perturbation during network training by maximizing the
classification loss on adversarial examples. Adversarial weight perturbation
helps reduce the robust generalization gap; however, it also undermines the
robustness improvement. A criterion that regulates the weight perturbation is
therefore crucial for adversarial training. In this paper, we propose such a
criterion, namely Loss Stationary Condition (LSC) for constrained perturbation.
With LSC, we find that it is essential to conduct weight perturbation on
adversarial data with small classification loss to eliminate robust
overfitting. Weight perturbation on adversarial data with large classification
loss is not necessary and may even lead to poor robustness. Based on these
observations, we propose a robust perturbation strategy to constrain the extent
of weight perturbation. The perturbation strategy prevents deep networks from
overfitting while avoiding the side effect of excessive weight perturbation,
significantly improving the robustness of adversarial training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the
state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.

reveals the misfits of particles in the current Standard Model (SM) theory. In
theory, neutrinos having masses could result in lepton flavour not being a
symmetry called Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV). While SM theory extensions
allowed LFV processes, their branching fractions are too small, making them
unobservable even with the strongest equipment up-to-date. With that,
scientists in recent years have generated LFV-like processes from the combined
LHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated data in an attempt to identify LFV using
Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep
Learning (DL). In this paper, the performance of several algorithms in AI has
been presented, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, custom 1-D Dense Block Neural
Networks (DBNNs), and custom 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
identifying LFV signals, specifically $\tau^{-} \rightarrow

performances among algorithms, except for the LightGBM, for failing the CvM
test, and a 20-layered CNN for having recorded a considerably low AUC.
Meanwhile, XGBoost and a 10-layered DBNN recorded the highest AUC of 0.88. The
main contribution of this paper is the extensive experiment involving custom

influence via spread and ignore self activation; (2) scalability to large
graphs; (3) generalizability across graph families; (4) low computational
efficiency with a large running time to identify seed sets for every test
network. In this work, we address each of these limitations through a unique
approach that involves (1) formulating a generic IM problem as a Markov
decision process that handles both intrinsic and influence activations; (2)
employing double Q learning to estimate seed nodes; (3) ensuring scalability
via sub-graph based representations; and (4) incorporating generalizability via
meta-learning across graph families. Extensive experiments are carried out in
various standard networks to validate performance of the proposed Graph Meta
Reinforcement learning (GraMeR) framework. The results indicate that GraMeR is
multiple orders faster and generic than conventional approaches.

group G and a choice of an element of the corresponding Weyl group there is an
associated Lusztig variety. When the element of G is regular semisimple, the
corresponding variety carries an action of the Weyl group on its (equivariant)
intersection cohomology. From this action, we recover the induced characters of
an element of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of the corresponding Hecke algebra. In
type A, we prove a more precise statement: that the Frobenius character of this
action is precisely the symmetric function given by the characters of a
Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element. The main idea is to find celular decompositions
of desingularizations of these varieties and apply the Brosnan-Chow
palindromicity criterion for determining when the local invariant cycle map is
an isomorphism.
  This recovers some results of Lusztig about character sheaves and gives a
generalization of the Brosnan-Chow solution to the Sharesian-Wachs conjecture
to non-codominant permutations, where singularities are involved. We also

an important direction towards extracting chemical bonding information from

proposed method is implemented in a unified framework within DFT-FE where the
ground-state DFT calculations and the population analysis are performed on the

patterns to predict their next interaction behaviors. Most existing sequential
recommendation methods only exploit the local context information of an
individual interaction sequence and learn model parameters solely based on the
item prediction loss. Thus, they usually fail to learn appropriate sequence
representations. This paper proposes a novel recommendation framework, namely
Graph Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (GCL4SR).
Specifically, GCL4SR employs a Weighted Item Transition Graph (WITG), built
based on interaction sequences of all users, to provide global context
information for each interaction and weaken the noise information in the
sequence data. Moreover, GCL4SR uses subgraphs of WITG to augment the
representation of each interaction sequence. Two auxiliary learning objectives
have also been proposed to maximize the consistency between augmented
representations induced by the same interaction sequence on WITG, and minimize
the difference between the representations augmented by the global context on
WITG and the local representation of the original sequence. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GCL4SR consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.

question.
  We address this question for a wide range of preferences and decisions that

strong notion of most equitable refinements for any irresolute rule that
satisfies anonymity and neutrality. Our technical contributions are threefold.
First, we characterize the conditions for the ANR impossibility to hold for

tie-breaking to obtain a most equitable refinement and design a polynomial-time

establish tight bounds on the semi-random likelihood of ANR violations, showing
that the likelihood is low for all anonymous and neutral irresolute rules with

its credibility, where adding some perturbation noise can easily change the
predictions. Previous works conducted adversarial attack methods to evaluate
the face anti-spoofing performance without any fine-grained analysis that which
model architecture or auxiliary feature is vulnerable to the adversary. To
handle this problem, we propose a novel framework to expose the fine-grained
adversarial vulnerability of the face anti-spoofing models, which consists of a
multitask module and a semantic feature augmentation (SFA) module. The
multitask module can obtain different semantic features for further evaluation,
but only attacking these semantic features fails to reflect the
discrimination-related vulnerability. We then design the SFA module to
introduce the data distribution prior for more discrimination-related gradient
directions for generating adversarial examples. Comprehensive experiments show
that SFA module increases the attack success rate by nearly 40$\%$ on average.
We conduct this fine-grained adversarial analysis on different annotations,
geometric maps, and backbone networks (e.g., Resnet network). These
fine-grained adversarial examples can be used for selecting robust backbone
networks and auxiliary features. They also can be used for adversarial
training, which makes it practical to further improve the accuracy and

  Pandemic Prevention through Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  More infectious virus variants can arise from rapid mutations in their
proteins, creating new infection waves. These variants can evade one's immune
system and infect vaccinated individuals, lowering vaccine efficacy. Hence, to
improve vaccine design, this project proposes Optimus PPIme - a deep learning
approach to predict future, more infectious variants from an existing virus
(exemplified by SARS-CoV-2). The approach comprises an algorithm which acts as
a ""virus"" attacking a host cell. To increase infectivity, the ""virus"" mutates
to bind better to the host's receptor. 2 algorithms were attempted - greedy
search and beam search. The strength of this variant-host binding was then
assessed by a transformer network we developed, with a high accuracy of 90%.
With both components, beam search eventually proposed more infectious variants.
Therefore, this approach can potentially enable researchers to develop vaccines
that provide protection against future infectious variants before they emerge,
pre-empting outbreaks and saving lives.

probability and statistics. It has various applications across different
fields. We consider two arbitrary matrices where one is a leave-one-column-out

the distance between two corresponding singular subspaces. It is well-suited
for mixture models and results in a sharper and finer statistical analysis than
classical perturbation bounds such as Wedin's Theorem. Powered by this
leave-one-out perturbation theory, we provide a deterministic entrywise
analysis for the performance of the spectral clustering under mixture models.
Our analysis leads to an explicit exponential error rate for the clustering of
sub-Gaussian mixture models. For the mixture of isotropic Gaussians, the rate
is optimal under a weaker signal-to-noise condition than that of L\""offler et

modeling the UWA channel using Echo State Network (ESN). In addition, the
potential application of transfer learning to reservoir computing has been

clouds, we further investigate the properties of their internal molecular gas
structures traced by the $^{13}$CO($J=$ 1$-$0) line emissions. Using three
different methods to extract the $^{13}$CO gas structures within each $^{12}$CO
cloud, we find that $\sim$ 15$\%$ of $^{12}$CO clouds (2851) have $^{13}$CO gas
structures and these $^{12}$CO clouds contribute about 93$\%$ of the total
integrated flux of $^{12}$CO emission. In each of 2851 $^{12}$CO clouds with
$^{13}$CO gas structures, the $^{13}$CO emission area generally does not exceed
70$\%$ of the $^{12}$CO emission area, and the $^{13}$CO integrated flux does
not exceed 20$\%$ of the $^{12}$CO integrated flux. We reveal a strong
correlation between the velocity-integrated intensities of $^{12}$CO lines and
those of $^{13}$CO lines in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission regions. This
indicates the H$_{2}$ column densities of molecular clouds are crucial for the
$^{13}$CO lines emission. After linking the $^{13}$CO structure detection rates
of the 18,190 $^{12}$CO molecular clouds to their morphologies, i.e.
nonfilaments and filaments, we find that the $^{13}$CO gas structures are
primarily detected in the $^{12}$CO clouds with filamentary morphologies.
Moreover, these filaments tend to harbor more than one $^{13}$CO structure.
That demonstrates filaments not only have larger spatial scales, but also have
more molecular gas structures traced by $^{13}$CO lines, i.e. the local gas
density enhancements. Our results favor the turbulent compression scenario for
filament formation, in which dynamical compression of turbulent flows induces
the local density enhancements. The nonfilaments tend to be in the low-pressure

  Retriever","18 pages",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommender retrievers aim to rapidly retrieve a fraction of items from the
entire item corpus when a user query requests, with the representative
two-tower model trained with the log softmax loss. For efficiently training
recommender retrievers on modern hardwares, inbatch sampling, where the items
in the mini-batch are shared as negatives to estimate the softmax function, has
attained growing interest. However, existing inbatch sampling based strategies
just correct the sampling bias of inbatch items with item frequency, being
unable to distinguish the user queries within the mini-batch and still
incurring significant bias from the softmax. In this paper, we propose a
Cache-Augmented Inbatch Importance Resampling (XIR) for training recommender
retrievers, which not only offers different negatives to user queries with
inbatch items, but also adaptively achieves a more accurate estimation of the
softmax distribution. Specifically, XIR resamples items for the given
mini-batch training pairs based on certain probabilities, where a cache with
more frequently sampled items is adopted to augment the candidate item set,
with the purpose of reusing the historical informative samples. XIR enables to
sample query-dependent negatives based on inbatch items and to capture dynamic
changes of model training, which leads to a better approximation of the softmax
and further contributes to better convergence. Finally, we conduct experiments
to validate the superior performance of the proposed XIR compared with
competitive approaches.

magnetic impurities have demonstrated that sustained Rabi oscillations can be
created by driving a magnetic moment with a microwave field frequency slightly
larger than the Larmor frequency and tuned to the Floquet resonance together
with another microwave field (image drive). These observations are confirmed by
the new experimental results reported in this paper. We investigate several
mechanisms of decoherence and dissipation by using a combination of numerical
and analytical techniques. The first microscopic model describes a magnetic
moment in external magnetic fields, interacting with a bath of two-level
systems acting as a source of decoherence and dissipation. The second model
describes a collection of the identical, interacting magnetics moments, all
subject to the same magnetic fields. In this case, the many-body interactions
causes a decay of the Rabi oscillations. In addition, we also study the effect
of the inhomogeneity of the microwave radiation on the decay of the Rabi
oscillations. Our simulation results show that the dynamics of a magnetic
moment subject to the two microwave fields with different frequencies and in
contact with an environment is highly nontrivial. We show that under
appropriate conditions, and in particular at the Floquet resonance, the
magnetization exhibits sustained Rabi oscillations, in some cases with
additional beatings. Although these two microscopic models separately describe
the experimental data well, a simulation study that simultaneously accounts for
both types of interactions is currently prohibitively costly. To gain further
insight into the microscopic dynamics of these two different models, we study
the time dependence of the bath and system energy and of the correlations of
the spins, data that is not readily accessible experimentally.

can craft a zero-shot classifier by ""prompt"", e.g., the confidence score of an
image being ""[CLASS]"" can be obtained by using the VLM provided similarity
measure between the image and the prompt sentence ""a photo of a [CLASS]"".
Therefore, prompt shows a great potential for fast adaptation of VLMs to
downstream tasks if we fine-tune the prompt-based similarity measure. However,
we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning may not only undermine the
prompt's inherent prediction for the task-related classes, but also for other
classes in the VLM vocabulary. Existing methods still address this problem by
using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data
augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompt. We present
Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed ProGrad, to prevent prompt tuning from
forgetting the the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, ProGrad
only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the
""general direction"", which is represented as the gradient of the KL loss of the
pre-defined prompt prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the stronger
few-shot generalization ability of ProGrad over state-of-the-art prompt tuning

  polling locations in Florida and North Carolina",,,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Voter suppression and associated racial disparities in access to voting are
long-standing civil rights concerns in the United States. Barriers to voting
have taken many forms over the decades. A history of violent explicit
discouragement has shifted to more subtle access limitations that can include
long lines and wait times, long travel times to reach a polling station, and
other logistical barriers to voting. Our focus in this work is on quantifying
disparities in voting access pertaining to the overall time-to-vote, and how
they could be remedied via a better choice of polling location or provisioning
more sites where voters can cast ballots. However, appropriately calibrating
access disparities is difficult because of the need to account for factors such
as population density and different community expectations for reasonable
travel times.
  In this paper, we quantify access to polling locations, developing a
methodology for the calibrated measurement of racial disparities in polling
location ""load"" and distance to polling locations. We apply this methodology to
a study of real-world data from Florida and North Carolina to identify
disparities in voting access from the 2020 election. We also introduce
algorithms, with modifications to handle scale, that can reduce these
disparities by suggesting new polling locations from a given list of identified
public locations (including schools and libraries). Applying these algorithms
on the 2020 election location data also helps to expose and explore tradeoffs
between the cost of allocating more polling locations and the potential impact
on access disparities. The developed voting access measurement methodology and
algorithmic remediation technique is a first step in better polling location
assignment.

suggests that gravity could be an emergent phenomenon. Following this,
Padmanabhan proposed a novel idea that the expansion of the universe can be
interpreted as equivalent to the emergence of space with the progress of cosmic
time. In this approach, the expansion of the universe is described by what is
known as the law of emergence, which states that the expansion of the universe
is driven by the difference between the number of bulk and surface degrees of
freedom in a region bounded by the Hubble radius. This principle correctly
reproduces the standard evolution of a Friedmann universe. We establish the
connection of the law of emergence, which is conceptually different from the
conventional paradigm to describe cosmology, with other well-established
results in thermodynamics. It has been shown that the law of emergence can be
derived from the unified first law of thermodynamics, which can then be
considered as the backbone of the law. However, the law of emergence is rich in
structure than implied by the First law thermodynamics alone. It further
explains the evolution of the universe towards a state of maximum horizon
entropy. Following this, it can be considered that the first law of
thermodynamics, along with the additional constraints imposed by the
maximisation of the horizon entropy, can together lead to the law of emergence.
In the present article, we first make a brief review of Padmanabhan's proposal
and then studies its connection with the thermodynamics of the horizon in the
context of Einstein's, Gauss-Bonnet, and more general Lovelock gravity
theories.

spherical harmonic function of degree two. In particular, we assume that a
perturbation contains a nondissipative part given by a linear combination of
the spherical harmonics of degree one and investigate the effect of the
nondissipative part on the long-time behavior of the perturbation through the
convection term. We show that the nondissipative part of a weak solution to the
nonlinear stability problem is preserved in time for all initial data.
Moreover, we prove that the dissipative part of the weak solution converges
exponentially in time towards an equilibrium which is expressed explicitly in
terms of the nondissipative part of the initial data and does not vanish in
general. In particular, it turns out that the asymptotic behavior of the weak

3D objects and scenes for photo-realistic rendering. However, its implicit
representation causes difficulty in manipulating the models like the explicit
mesh representation. Several recent advances in NeRF manipulation are usually
restricted by a shared renderer network, or suffer from large model size. To
circumvent the hurdle, in this paper, we present an explicit neural field
representation that enables efficient and convenient manipulation of models. To
achieve this goal, we learn a hybrid tensor rank decomposition of the scene
without neural networks. Motivated by the low-rank approximation property of
the SVD algorithm, we propose a rank-residual learning strategy to encourage
the preservation of primary information in lower ranks. The model size can then
be dynamically adjusted by rank truncation to control the levels of detail,
achieving near-optimal compression without extra optimization. Furthermore,
different models can be arbitrarily transformed and composed into one scene by
concatenating along the rank dimension. The growth of storage cost can also be
mitigated by compressing the unimportant objects in the composed scene. We
demonstrate that our method is able to achieve comparable rendering quality to
state-of-the-art methods, while enabling extra capability of compression and
composition. Code will be made available at https://github.com/ashawkey/CCNeRF.

promising candidate waveform for high mobility communication scenarios. In
practical transmission, OTFS with rectangular pulse shaping is implemented
using different prefix/suffix configurations including reduced-cyclic prefix
(RCP), full-CP (FCP), full-zero suffix (FZS), and reduced-zero padded (RZP).
However, for each prefix/suffix type, different effective channel are seen at
the receiver side resulting in dissimilar performance of the various OTFS
configurations given a specific communication scenario. To fulfill this gap, in
this paper, we study and model the effective channel in OTFS systems using
various prefix/suffix configurations. Then, from the input-output relation
analysis of the received signal, we show that the OTFS has a simple sparse
structure for all prefix/suffix types, where the only difference is the phase
term introduced when extending quasi-periodically in the delay-Doppler grid. We
provide a comprehensive comparison between all OTFS types in terms of channel
estimation/equalization complexity, symbol detection performance, power and
spectral efficiencies, which helps in deciding the optimal prefix/suffix

pairwise 3D geometric shape mating, and propose Neural Shape Mating (NSM) to
tackle this problem. Given the point clouds of two object parts of an unknown

pair of 3D poses that tightly mate them together. We couple the training of NSM
with an implicit shape reconstruction task to make NSM more robust to imperfect

super-resolution via deep learning. Particularly, we focus on how to embed the
high-dimensional spatial-spectral information of HS images efficiently and
effectively. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods adopting
empirically-designed network modules, we formulate HS embedding as an
approximation of the posterior distribution of a set of carefully-defined HS
embedding events, including layer-wise spatial-spectral feature extraction and
network-level feature aggregation. Then, we incorporate the proposed feature
embedding scheme into a source-consistent super-resolution framework that is
physically-interpretable, producing lightweight PDE-Net, in which
high-resolution (HR) HS images are iteratively refined from the residuals
between input low-resolution (LR) HS images and pseudo-LR-HS images degenerated
from reconstructed HR-HS images via probability-inspired HS embedding.
Extensive experiments over three common benchmark datasets demonstrate that
PDE-Net achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Besides,
the probabilistic characteristic of this kind of networks can provide the
epistemic uncertainty of the network outputs, which may bring additional
benefits when used for other HS image-based applications. The code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/jinnh/PDE-Net.

time. In these graphs, reachability among the nodes relies on paths that
traverse edges in chronological order (\emph{temporal paths}). Unlike standard
paths, temporal paths are not always composable, thus the reachability relation
is \emph{not transitive} and connected components do not form equivalence
classes.
  We investigate the evolution of connected components in a simple model of
random temporal graphs. In this model, a random temporal graph is obtained by
permuting uniformly at random the edges of an Erd\""os-R\'enyi graph and
interpreting the positions in this permutation as presence times. Phase
transitions for several reachability properties were recently characterized in
this model [Casteigts et al., FOCS 2021], in particular for one-to-one,
one-to-all, and all-to-all reachability. The characterization of similar
transitions for the existence of giant components was left open.
  In this paper, we develop a set of new techniques and use them to
characterize the emergence of giant components in random temporal graphs. Our
results imply that the growth of temporal components departs significantly from
its classical analog. In particular, the largest component transitions abruptly
from containing almost no vertices to almost all vertices at $p = \log n / n$,
whereas in static random graphs (directed or not), a giant component of
intermediate size arises first, and keeps steadily growing afterwards. This
threshold holds for both \emph{open} and \emph{closed} temporal components,
i.e., components that respectively allow or forbid the use of external nodes to
achieve internal reachability, a distinction arising in the absence of
transitivity.

rise time of about 5 days with an extremely high UV peak luminosity shares
similarities to a handful of fast blue optical transients whose peak
luminosities are comparable with the most luminous supernovae while their
timescales are significantly shorter (hereafter ""fast blue ultraluminous

normal low-mass galaxy at a redshift of 1.063, suggesting a possible connection
between the energy source of MUSSES2020J and the central part of the host
galaxy. Possible physical mechanisms powering this extreme transient such as a
wind-driven tidal disruption event and an interaction between supernova and
circumstellar material are qualitatively discussed based on the first multiband
early-phase light curve of FBUTs, although whether the scenarios can
quantitatively explain the early photometric behavior of MUSSES2020J requires
systematical theoretical investigations. Thanks to the ultrahigh luminosity in

of FBUTs from the local to the high-z universe can be discovered through deep

physico-chemical properties during and after the printing process. Here, we
show first steps towards a simple, fast and easy to implement algorithm to
predict the final structure topography for multi-photon lithography - also
known as Direct Laser Writing (DLW). The three main steps of DLW, (i) exposure
of a photo resin, (ii) cross-linking of the resin, and (iii) subsequent
shrinkage are approximated by mathematical operations, showing promising
results in coincidence with experimental observations. E.g., the
root-mean-square error (rmse) between the unmodified 3D print of a
radial-symmetrically chirped topography and our predicted topography is only
0.46 $\mu$m, whereas the rmse between this 3D print and its target is 1.49
$\mu$m. Thus, our robust predictions can be used prior to the printing process
to minimize undesired deviations between the target structure and the final 3D
printed structure. Using a Downhill-Simplex algorithm for identifying the
optimal prediction parameters, we were able to reduce the rmse from 4.04 $\mu$m
to 0.33 $\mu$m by only two correction loops in our best-case scenario (rmse =
0.72 $\mu$m after one loop). Consequently, this approach can eliminate the need
for many structural optimization loops to produce highly conformal and high

that adapt the number of hash functions according to the query element. That
is, they use a sequence of hash functions $h_1, h_2, \dots$ and insert $x$ by
setting the bits in $k_x$ positions $h_1(x), h_2(x), \dots, h_{k_x}(x)$ to 1,
where the parameter $k_x$ depends on $x$. Similarly, a query for $x$ checks
whether the bits at positions $h_1(x), h_2(x), \dots, h_{k_x}(x)$ contain a $0$
(in which case we know that $x$ was not inserted), or contains only $1$s (in
which case $x$ may have been inserted, but it could also be a false positive).
  In this paper, we determine a near-optimal choice of the parameters $k_x$ in
a model where $n$ elements are inserted independently from a probability
distribution $\mathcal{P}$ and query elements are chosen from a probability
distribution $\mathcal{Q}$, under a bound on the false positive probability
$F$. In contrast, the parameter choice of Bruck et al., as well as follow-up
work by Wang et al., does not guarantee a nontrivial bound on the false
positive rate. We refer to our parameterization of the weighted Bloom filter as
a $\textit{Daisy Bloom filter}$.
  For many distributions $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, the Daisy Bloom
filter space usage is significantly smaller than that of Standard Bloom
filters. Our upper bound is complemented with an information-theoretical lower
bound, showing that (with mild restrictions on the distributions $\mathcal{P}$
and $\mathcal{Q}$), the space usage of Daisy Bloom filters is the best possible
up to a constant factor.
  Daisy Bloom filters can be seen as a fine-grained variant of a recent data
structure of Vaidya, Knorr, Mitzenmacher and Kraska. Like their work, we are
motivated by settings in which we have prior knowledge of the workload of the
filter, possibly in the form of advice from a machine learning algorithm.

framework, which consists of two novel technical ingredients, The first is a
fully polynomial-time distributed tree decomposition algorithm, which outputs a
decomposition of width $O(\tau^2\log n)$ in $\tilde{O}(\tau^{O(1)}D)$ rounds
(where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph). The second ingredient, and the
technical highlight of this paper, is the novel concept of a \emph{stateful
walk constraint}, which naturally defines a set of feasible walks in the input
graph based on their local properties (e.g., augmenting paths). Given a
stateful walk constraint, the constrained version of the shortest paths problem
(or distance labeling) requires the algorithm to output the shortest
\emph{constrained} walk (or its distance) for a given source and sink vertices.
We show that this problem can be efficiently solved in the CONGEST model by
reducing it to an \emph{unconstrained} version of the problem.

understood. In this study, using the the discrete element method (DEM) with
spherical particles and realistic contact laws, we investigate the mechanics of
granular systems with a wide range of inter-particle frictional coefficients
and aim to establish a friction-dependent rheology for dry granular flows. The
corresponding results show that increasing inter-particle friction dramatically
increases the effective frictional coefficient, $\mu_{\textrm{eff}}$, while
decreasing the solid fraction of the system and increasing the transitional
inertial number that marks the division of quasi-static regimes and
intermediate flow regimes. We further propose a new dimensionless number,
$\mathcal{M}$, as a ratio between the inertial effect and frictional effect,
which is similar to the effective aspect ratio in granular column collapses,
and unifies the influence of inter-particle friction with the inertial number.
We then establish a relationship between $\mathcal{M}$ and the dimensionless
granular temperature, $\Theta$, to further universalize the influence of
inter-particle frictions. Such study can broaden the application of the
$\mu(I)$ rheology in natural and engineering systems and help establish a more

multiple clients collaboratively train deep learning models without
centralizing their local data, and hence preserve data privacy. Real-world
applications usually involve a distribution shift across the datasets of the
different clients, which hurts the generalization ability of the clients to
unseen samples from their respective data distributions. In this work, we
address the recently proposed feature shift problem where the clients have
different feature distributions, while the label distribution is the same. We
propose Federated Representation Augmentation (FRAug) to tackle this practical
and challenging problem. Our approach generates synthetic client-specific
samples in the embedding space to augment the usually small client datasets.
For that, we train a shared generative model to fuse the clients knowledge
learned from their different feature distributions. This generator synthesizes
client-agnostic embeddings, which are then locally transformed into
client-specific embeddings by Representation Transformation Networks (RTNets).
By transferring knowledge across the clients, the generated embeddings act as a
regularizer for the client models and reduce overfitting to the local original
datasets, hence improving generalization. Our empirical evaluation on public
benchmarks and a real-world medical dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of
the proposed method, which substantially outperforms the current
state-of-the-art FL methods for non-IID features, including PartialFed and
FedBN.

disk component of the Sgr dwarf with spiral over-densities provides a first
step towards a working model to reproduce the observed faint branch of the

recent work by Huggins et al. reports a novel candidate, i.e. a
quantum-classical hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm with a reduced bias in

family of scalable quantum-assisted Monte Carlo algorithms where the quantum

incorporating a Bayesian inference approach, we can achieve this
quantum-facilitated bias reduction with a much smaller quantum-computing cost

to accomplish model training without aggregating data at a central server. Most
studies on FL consider a centralized framework, in which a single server is
endowed with a central authority to coordinate a number of devices to perform
model training in an iterative manner. Due to stringent communication and
bandwidth constraints, such a centralized framework has limited scalability as
the number of devices grows. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a
ConFederated Learning (CFL) framework. The proposed CFL consists of multiple
servers, in which each server is connected with an individual set of devices as
in the conventional FL framework, and decentralized collaboration is leveraged
among servers to make full use of the data dispersed throughout the network. We
develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for
CFL. The proposed algorithm employs a random scheduling policy which randomly
selects a subset of devices to access their respective servers at each
iteration, thus alleviating the need of uploading a huge amount of information
from devices to servers. Theoretical analysis is presented to justify the
proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed method can converge
to a decent solution significantly faster than gradient-based FL algorithms,
thus boasting a substantial advantage in terms of communication efficiency.

tests of gravity, the consistency of measured excitation amplitudes and phases

pretraining language models. However, the prior seq2seq pretraining models
generally focus on reconstructive objectives on the decoder side and neglect
the effect of encoder-side supervision, which we argue may lead to sub-optimal
performance. To verify our hypothesis, we first empirically study the
functionalities of the encoder and decoder in seq2seq pretrained language
models, and find that the encoder takes an important but under-exploitation
role than the decoder regarding the downstream performance and neuron
activation. Therefore, we propose an encoding-enhanced seq2seq pretraining
strategy, namely E2S2, which improves the seq2seq models via integrating more
efficient self-supervised information into the encoders. Specifically, E2S2
adopts two self-supervised objectives on the encoder side from two aspects: 1)
locally denoising the corrupted sentence (denoising objective); and 2) globally
learning better sentence representations (contrastive objective). With the help
of both objectives, the encoder can effectively distinguish the noise tokens
and capture high-level (i.e. syntactic and semantic) knowledge, thus
strengthening the ability of seq2seq model to accurately achieve the
conditional generation. On a large diversity of downstream natural language
understanding and generation tasks, E2S2 dominantly improves the performance of
its powerful backbone models, e.g. BART and T5. For example, upon BART
backbone, we achieve +1.1% averaged gain on the general language understanding

tested for emulating a deep neural network. We observed that when the skyrmion

the sense that class-incremental learning using ACIL given present data would
give identical results to that from its joint-learning counterpart which
consumes both present and historical samples. This equality is theoretically
validated. Data privacy is ensured since no historical data are involved during
the learning process. Empirical validations demonstrate ACIL's competitive
accuracy performance with near-identical results for various incremental task
settings (e.g., 5-50 phases). This also allows ACIL to outperform the
state-of-the-art methods for large-phase scenarios (e.g., 25 and 50 phases).

been proposed to apply adversarial training locally before global aggregation.
Although these methods demonstrate promising results on independent identically

with label skewness, resulting in degraded natural accuracy. This tends to
hinder the application of FAT in real-world applications where the label
distribution across the clients is often skewed. In this paper, we study the
problem of FAT under label skewness, and reveal one root cause of the training
instability and natural accuracy degradation issues: skewed labels lead to
non-identical class probabilities and heterogeneous local models. We then
propose a Calibrated FAT (CalFAT) approach to tackle the instability issue by
calibrating the logits adaptively to balance the classes. We show both
theoretically and empirically that the optimization of CalFAT leads to
homogeneous local models across the clients and better convergence points.

topological nature of VCSELs, that is usually overlooked in the description of

arbitrary networks gather at a single node. There exist $k$ agents with unique
identifiers (IDs) in the network, and $f$ of them are weakly Byzantine agents,
which behave arbitrarily except for falsifying their IDs. The agents behave in
synchronous rounds, and each node does not have any memory like a whiteboard.
In the literature, there exists a gathering algorithm that tolerates any number
of Byzantine agents, while the fastest gathering algorithm requires
$\Omega(f^2)$ non-Byzantine agents. This paper proposes an algorithm that
solves the gathering problem efficiently with $\Omega(f)$ non-Byzantine agents
since there is a large gap between the number of non-Byzantine agents in
previous works. The proposed algorithm achieves the gathering in
$O(f\cdot|\Lambda_{good}|\cdot X(N))$ rounds in case of $9f+8\leq k$ and
simultaneous startup if $N$ is given to agents, where $|\Lambda_{good}|$ is the
length of the largest ID among non-Byzantine agents, and $X(n)$ is the number
of rounds required to explore any network composed of $n$ nodes. This algorithm
is faster than the most fault-tolerant existing algorithm and requires fewer
non-Byzantine agents than the fastest algorithm if $n$ is given to agents,
although the guarantees on simultaneous termination and startup delay are not
the same. To achieve this property, we propose a new technique to simulate a
Byzantine consensus algorithm for synchronous message-passing systems on agent

For instance, when coarsening or rewiring operations are present along the
pipeline, one needs to keep track of the corresponding nodes between the
original and modified graphs. Classically, these maps are represented as binary
node-to-node correspondence matrices and used as-is to transfer node-wise
features between the graphs. In this paper, we argue that simply changing this
map representation can bring notable benefits to graph learning tasks. Drawing
inspiration from recent progress in geometry processing, we introduce a
spectral representation for maps that is easy to integrate into existing graph
learning models. This spectral representation is a compact and straightforward
plug-in replacement and is robust to topological changes of the graphs.
Remarkably, the representation exhibits structural properties that make it
interpretable, drawing an analogy with recent results on smooth manifolds. We
demonstrate the benefits of incorporating spectral maps in graph learning
pipelines, addressing scenarios where a node-to-node map is not well defined,
or in the absence of exact isomorphism. Our approach bears practical benefits
in knowledge distillation and hierarchical learning, where we show comparable
or improved performance at a fraction of the computational cost.

law. Area-preserved branching conflicts with energy minimization and hence the
least-work principle. Additionally, while Kleiber's law is the dominant rule
for both animals and plants, small animals are observed to follow the 2/3-power
law, large animals have larger than 3/4 scaling exponents, and small plants
have near-linear scaling behaviors. No known theory explains all the
observations. Here, I show that animals' metabolism is determined by their
Murray's vascular systems. For plants, the scaling is determined by the trunks'
hydraulic conductance and the leaves' photosynthesis. Both analyses agree with
data of various body sizes. Animals' scaling has a concave curvature while
plants have a convex one. The empirical power laws are approximations within
selected mass ranges. Generally, the 3/4-power law applies to animals of ~15 g

the same time, our approach retains state-of-the-art classification performance
for known DGAs. Our evaluation is based on a leave-one-group-out
cross-validation with a total of 94 DGA families. By using the maximum number
of known DGAs, our evaluation scenario is particularly difficult and close to
the real world. All of the approaches examined are privacy-preserving, since
they operate without context and exclusively on a single domain to be
classified. We round up our study with a thorough discussion of
class-incremental learning strategies that can adapt an existing classifier to
newly discovered classes.

traffic monitoring and driving assistant, deep learning-based object detection
(DL-OD) has been increasingly attractive in intelligent transportation systems.
However, it is difficult for the existing DL-OD schemes to realize the
responsible, cost-saving, and energy-efficient autonomous vehicle systems due
to low their inherent defects of low timeliness and high energy consumption. In
this paper, we propose an object detection (OD) system based on edge-cloud
cooperation and reconstructive convolutional neural networks, which is called
Edge YOLO. This system can effectively avoid the excessive dependence on
computing power and uneven distribution of cloud computing resources.
Specifically, it is a lightweight OD framework realized by combining pruning
feature extraction network and compression feature fusion network to enhance
the efficiency of multi-scale prediction to the largest extent. In addition, we
developed an autonomous driving platform equipped with NVIDIA Jetson for
system-level verification. We experimentally demonstrate the reliability and
efficiency of Edge YOLO on COCO2017 and KITTI data sets, respectively.
According to COCO2017 standard datasets with a speed of 26.6 frames per second
(FPS), the results show that the number of parameters in the entire network is
only 25.67 MB, while the accuracy (mAP) is up to 47.3%.

along the treatment field. However, in clinical practice, a constant RBE of 1.1
is assumed, which can result in undesirable side effects. This study provides
an accurate overview of current clinical practice for considering proton RBE in
Europe. Materials and Methods: A survey was devised and sent to all proton
therapy centres in Europe that treat patients. The online questionnaire
consisted of 39 questions addressing various aspects of RBE consideration in
clinical practice, including treatment planning, patient follow-up and future
demands. Results: All 25 proton therapy centres responded. All centres
prescribed a constant RBE of 1.1, but also applied measures (except for one eye
treatment centre) to counteract variable RBE effects such as avoiding beams
stopping inside or in front of an organ at risk and putting restrictions on the
minimum number and opening angle of incident beams for certain treatment sites.
For the future, most centres (16) asked for more retrospective or prospective
outcome studies investigating the potential effect of the effect of a variable
RBE. To perform such studies, 18 centres asked for LET and RBE calculation and
visualisation tools developed by treatment planning system vendors. Conclusion:
All European proton centres are aware of RBE variability but comply with
current guidelines of prescribing a constant RBE. However, they actively
mitigate uncertainty and risk of side effects resulting from increased RBE by
applying measures and restrictions during treatment planning. To change
RBE-related clinical guidelines in the future more clinical data on RBE are
explicitly demanded.

into the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms behind the evolution of

method that helps into the discovery of new NP biosynthetic pathways from
actinobacterial genome sequences with emphasis on members of the genus
Streptomyces. I developed this method using a comparative and functional
genomics perspective. My studies indicate that central metabolic enzymes were
expanded in a genus-specific manner in Actinobacteria, and that they have been
extensively recruited for the biosynthesis of NPs. Based in these observations,
I developed EvoMining, a bioinformatic pipeline for the identificatoon of novel
biosynthetic pathways in microbial genomes. Using EvoMining several new NP
biosynthetic pathways have been predicted in different members of the phylum
Actinobacteria, including the model organism S. lividans 66. To test this
approach, the genome sequence of this model strain was obtained, and its
analysis led to the discovery of an unprecedented system for peptide bond
formation, as well as a biosynthetic pathway for an arsenic-containing
metabolite. Moreover, this work also led to the identification of expansions on
a conserved metabolic node in the glycolytic pathway of Streptomyces. These
expansions occurred before the radiation of Streptomyces and are concomitant
with the evolution of their capability to produce NPs. Experimental analyses
indicate that this node evolved to mediate the interplay between central an NP
metabolism.

self-supervised pre-training of vision transformers. A key idea of efficient
implementation is to discard the masked image patches (or tokens) throughout
the target network (encoder), which requires the encoder to be a plain vision
transformer (e.g., ViT), albeit hierarchical vision transformers (e.g., Swin
Transformer) have potentially better properties in formulating vision inputs.
In this paper, we offer a new design of hierarchical vision transformers named
HiViT (short for Hierarchical ViT) that enjoys both high efficiency and good
performance in MIM. The key is to remove the unnecessary ""local inter-unit
operations"", deriving structurally simple hierarchical vision transformers in
which mask-units can be serialized like plain vision transformers. For this
purpose, we start with Swin Transformer and (i) set the masking unit size to be
the token size in the main stage of Swin Transformer, (ii) switch off
inter-unit self-attentions before the main stage, and (iii) eliminate all
operations after the main stage. Empirical studies demonstrate the advantageous
performance of HiViT in terms of fully-supervised, self-supervised, and
transfer learning. In particular, in running MAE on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B
reports a +0.6% accuracy gain over ViT-B and a 1.9$\times$ speed-up over
Swin-B, and the performance gain generalizes to downstream tasks of detection
and segmentation. Code will be made publicly available.

significantly boost the performance of 3D perception models as each modality
has complementary information to the other. However, we observe that current
datasets are captured from expensive vehicles that are explicitly designed for
data collection purposes, and cannot truly reflect the realistic data
distribution due to various reasons. To this end, we collect a series of

establishing the robustness benchmark on two widely-adopted autonomous driving

take on both signs, there can be a cancellation of terms that flattens the
potentials and allows one to satisfy current data, and forecasts with strong
constraints on the tensor to scalar ratio. Models of field theory monodromy are
naturally enhanced to include a mechanism for canceling off radiative
corrections to vacuum energy, via vacuum energy sequestering (VES). Although
they include a much larger parameter space, we find that a similar numerical
examination yields no significant change in the Bayesian evidence for VES
enhanced models, with naturalness considerations making them more attractive

to map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our
goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of
modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an
encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage
decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a
sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity
for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic
performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision
Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online
trials and errors from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate
MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo,
Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that MAT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared

ground-state wave functions of a single molecular system well but can also
generalize to multiple geometries. While such generalization significantly
speeds up training, each energy evaluation still requires Monte Carlo
integration which limits the evaluation to a few geometries. In this work, we
address the inference shortcomings by proposing the Potential learning from
ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which we simultaneously train a
surrogate model in addition to the neural wave function. At inference time, the
surrogate avoids expensive Monte-Carlo integration by directly estimating the
energy, accelerating the process from hours to milliseconds. In this way, we
can accurately model high-resolution multi-dimensional energy surfaces for
larger systems that previously were unobtainable via neural wave functions.
Finally, we explore an additional inductive bias by introducing
physically-motivated restricted neural wave function models. We implement such
a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model. In
our experimental evaluation, PlaNet accelerates inference by 7 orders of
magnitude for larger molecules like ethanol while preserving accuracy. Compared
to previous energy surface networks, PESNet++ reduces energy errors by up to
74%.

enhanced due to the cold temperatures and high densities. Therefore, the
chemistry of deuterated molecules can be used to probe the evolution and the
kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. Aims: We analyse emission
maps of cyclopropenylidene, c-C$_3$H$_2$, to study the distribution of the
deuteration throughout the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. Methods: We use
single-dish observations of c-C$_3$H$_2$, c-H$^{13}$CC$_2$H, c-C$_3$HD, and
c-C$_3$D$_2$ towards the pre-stellar core L1544, performed at the IRAM 30m
telescope. We derive the column density and deuterium fraction maps, and
compare these observations with non-LTE radiative transfer simulations.
Results: The highest deuterium fractions are found close to the dust peak at
the centre of L1544, where the increased abundance of H$_2$D$^+$ ions drives
the deuteration process. The peak values are
N(c-C$_3$HD)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2)=0.17\pm0.01$,
N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2)=0.025\pm0.003$ and
N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$HD$)=0.16\pm0.03$, which is consistent with previous
single point observations. The distributions of c-C$_3$HD and c-C$_3$D$_2$
indicate that the deuterated forms of c-C$_3$H$_2$ in fact trace the dust peak
and not the c-C$_3$H$_2$ peak. Conclusions: The N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$HD)
map confirms that the process of deuteration is more efficient towards the
centre of the core and demonstrates that carbon-chain molecules are still
present at high densities. This is likely caused by an increased abundance of
He$^+$ ions destroying CO, which increases the amount of carbon atoms in the
gas phase.

study by B\""ohme and Zhu shows that four in every five bugs have been
introduced by recent code changes (i.e. regressions). In this paper, we take a
close look at the integration of fuzzers to CI/CD pipelines from both automated
software testing and continuous development angles. Firstly, we study an
optimization opportunity to triage commits that do not require fuzzing and
find, through experimental analysis, that the average fuzzing effort in CI/CD
can be reduced by ~63% in three of the nine libraries we analyzed (>40% for six
libraries). Secondly, we investigate the impact of fuzzing campaign duration on
the CI/CD process: A shorter fuzzing campaign such as 15 minutes (as opposed to
the wisdom of 24 hours in the field) facilitates a faster pipeline and can
still uncover important bugs, but may also reduce its capability to detect
sophisticated bugs. Lastly, we discuss a prioritization strategy that
automatically assigns resources to fuzzing campaigns based on a set of
predefined priority strategies. Our findings suggest that continuous fuzzing
(as part of the automated testing in CI/CD) is indeed beneficial and there are
many optimization opportunities to improve the effectiveness and scalability of
fuzz testing.

local grouping and subsampling are the necessary data structuring steps in most
hierarchical deep learning models. Due to the disorder nature of the points in
a point cloud, the significant time cost may be consumed when grouping and
subsampling the points, which consequently results in poor scalability. This
paper proposes a fast data structuring method called PSNet (Point Structuring
Net). PSNet transforms the spatial features of the points and matches them to
the features of local areas in a point cloud. PSNet achieves grouping and
sampling at the same time while the existing methods process sampling and
grouping in two separate steps (such as using FPS plus kNN). PSNet performs
feature transformation pointwise while the existing methods uses the spatial
relationship among the points as the reference for grouping. Thanks to these
features, PSNet has two important advantages: 1) the grouping and sampling
results obtained by PSNet is stable and permutation invariant; and 2) PSNet can
be easily parallelized. PSNet can replace the data structuring methods in the
mainstream point cloud deep learning models in a plug-and-play manner. We have
conducted extensive experiments. The results show that PSNet can improve the
training and inference speed significantly while maintaining the model
accuracy.

examine how the introduction of the mass is actually related to the appearance
of appropriate distortions in the conformal sector, which lead to new
conservation laws. As a prominent example we use a general pp-wave metric,
which exploits this property to the maximum. We study the necessary geometric
conditions, so that such types of distortions are applicable. We show that the

connection to higher order (hidden) symmetries. Except from the pp-wave
geometry, we also provide an additional example in the form of the de Sitter
metric. Again, the proper conformal Killing vectors can be appropriately
distorted to generate conserved quantities for massive geodesics. Subsequently,
we proceed by introducing an additional symmetry breaking effect. The latter is
realized by considering a Bogoslovsky type of line-element, which involves a
Lorentz violating parameter. We utilize once more the pp-wave case as a guide

defined for scalar target variables, due to the formulation of its objective
function, and since the notion of quantiles has no standard definition for
multivariate distributions. Recently, vector quantile regression (VQR) was
proposed as an extension of QR for vector-valued target variables, thanks to a
meaningful generalization of the notion of quantiles to multivariate
distributions via optimal transport. Despite its elegance, VQR is arguably not
applicable in practice due to several limitations: (i) it assumes a linear
model for the quantiles of the target $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Y}}$ given the
features $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}$; (ii) its exact formulation is intractable

regressed quantile levels, or number of features, and its relaxed dual
formulation may violate the monotonicity of the estimated quantiles; (iii) no
fast or scalable solvers for VQR currently exist. In this work we fully address
these limitations, namely: (i) We extend VQR to the non-linear case, showing
substantial improvement over linear VQR; (ii) We propose {vector monotone
rearrangement}, a method which ensures the quantile functions estimated by VQR
are monotone functions; (iii) We provide fast, GPU-accelerated solvers for

against the ensemble of re-rankers based on multilingual pretrained language
models (PLMs) and also variants of the shared task baseline, re-training it
from scratch using a recently introduced contrastive loss that maintains a
strong gradient signal throughout training by means of mixed negative samples.
For answer generation, we focused on language- and domain-specialization by
means of continued language model (LM) pretraining of existing multilingual
encoders. Additionally, for both passage retrieval and answer generation, we
augmented the training data provided by the task organizers with automatically
generated question-answer pairs created from Wikipedia passages to mitigate the
issue of data scarcity, particularly for the low-resource languages for which
no training data were provided. Our results show that language- and
domain-specialization as well as data augmentation help, especially for

accumulation in the inner artery wall. In atherosclerotic plaque formation
monocytes and macrophages play a significant role in controlling the disease

atherosclerotic plaque formation is presented in terms of an autonomous system
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations involving concentrations of
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), monocytes, macrophages, and foam cells
as the key dependent variables. To observe the capacity of monocytes and
macrophages the model has been reduced to a two-dimensional temporal model
using quasi steady state approximation theory. Linear stability analysis of the
two-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) model has revealed the
stability of the equilibrium points in the system. We have considered both one-
and two- parameter bifurcation analysis with respect to parameters associated
to the rate at which macrophages phagocytose oxidised LDL and the rate at which
LDL enters into the intima. The bifurcation diagrams reveal the oscillating
nature of the curves representing concentration of monocytes and macrophages
with respect to significant model parameters. We are able to find the threshold
values at which the plaque accumulation accelerates in an uncontrollable way.
Further to observe the impact of diffusion, a spatiotemporal model has been
developed. Numerical investigation of the partial differential equations (PDEs)
model reveals the existence of travelling wave in the system which ensures the
fact that the development of atherosclerotic plaque formation follows
reaction-diffusion wave.

vision community because of their flexibility in exploiting contextual
information, whether it is sharply confined local, or long range global.
However, they are known to be data hungry. This has motivated the research in
self-supervised transformer pretraining, which does not need to decode the
semantic information conveyed by labels to link it to the image properties, but
rather focuses directly on extracting a concise representation of the image
data that reflects the notion of similarity, and is invariant to nuisance
factors. The key vehicle for the self-learning process used by the majority of
self-learning methods is the generation of multiple views of the training data
and the creation of pretext tasks which use these views to define the notion of
image similarity, and data integrity. However, this approach lacks the natural
propensity to extract contextual information. We propose group masked model
learning (GMML), a self-supervised learning (SSL) mechanism for pretraining
vision transformers with the ability to extract the contextual information
present in all the concepts in an image. GMML achieves this by manipulating
randomly groups of connected tokens, ensuingly covering a meaningful part of a
semantic concept, and then recovering the hidden semantic information from the
visible part of the concept. GMML implicitly introduces a novel data
augmentation process. Unlike most of the existing SSL approaches, GMML does not
require momentum encoder, nor rely on careful implementation details such as
large batches and gradient stopping, which are all artefacts of most of the
current self-supervised learning techniques. The source code is publicly
available for the community to train on bigger corpora:

It follows that a large class of Gaussian linear mixed working models lead to
unbiased estimates of a causal treatment effect, even if they do not capture
the true data generating mechanism. We compare a range of working regression
models in a simulation study where data are simulated from a complex data
generating mechanism with input parameters estimated on a real TQT data set. In
this setting, we find that for all practical purposes working models adjusting

  Transformers","Submitted to International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point cloud completion task aims to predict the missing part of incomplete
point clouds and generate complete point clouds with details. In this paper, we
propose a novel point cloud completion network, namely CompleteDT.
Specifically, features are learned from point clouds with different
resolutions, which is sampled from the incomplete input, and are converted to a
series of \textit{spots} based on the geometrical structure. Then, the Dense
Relation Augment Module (DRA) based on the transformer is proposed to learn
features within \textit{spots} and consider the correlation among these
\textit{spots}. The DRA consists of Point Local-Attention Module (PLA) and
Point Dense Multi-Scale Attention Module (PDMA), where the PLA captures the
local information within the local \textit{spots} by adaptively measuring
weights of neighbors and the PDMA exploits the global relationship between
these \textit{spots} in a multi-scale densely connected manner. Lastly, the
complete shape is predicted from \textit{spots} by the Multi-resolution Point
Fusion Module (MPF), which gradually generates complete point clouds from
\textit{spots}, and updates \textit{spots} based on these generated point
clouds. Experimental results show that, because the DRA based on the
transformer can learn the expressive features from the incomplete input and the
MPF can fully explore these feature to predict the complete input, our method
largely outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

wireless communication systems are facing jamming and abnormal signal

which makes it very challenging for abnormal signal recognition. In this paper,
we propose a new abnormal signal recognition scheme, which combines
time-frequency analysis with deep learning to effectively identify synthetic
abnormal communication signals. Firstly, we emulate synthetic abnormal
communication signals including seven jamming patterns. Then, we model an
abnormal communication signals recognition system based on the communication
protocol between the transmitter and the receiver. To improve the performance,
we convert the original signal into the time-frequency spectrogram to develop
an image classification algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can effectively recognize the abnormal signals under various
parameter configurations, even under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low

way of creating C stochastic processes characterized by: 1) the C processes are

since the number of Gaussian Processes (GP) operations (e.g. inverting the
inducing point's covariance matrix) do not depend on the number of processes.
This makes the ETGP particularly suited for multi-class problems with a very
large number of classes, which are the problems studied in this work. ETGPs
exploit the recently proposed Transformed Gaussian Process (TGP), a stochastic
process specified by transforming a Gaussian Process using an invertible
transformation. However, unlike TGPs, ETGPs are constructed by transforming a
single sample from a GP using C invertible transformations. We derive an
efficient sparse variational inference algorithm for the proposed model and
demonstrate its utility in 5 classification tasks which include
low/medium/large datasets and a different number of classes, ranging from just

the traditional reaction-diffusion models are modified by adding mechanically

introduces artefacts that need to be treated in a rather manual way. By taking
second-order finite differences on the detector data and inferring the
corresponding background noise distribution, we develop a framework to perform
gravitational-wave data analysis directly using $\psi_4(t)$ templates. We first
demonstrate this formalism through the recovery numerically simulated signals
from head-on collisions of Proca stars injected in Advanced LIGO noise. Next,
we re-analyse the event GW190521 under the hypothesis of a Proca-star merger,
obtaining results equivalent to those in Ref [1], where we used the classical
strain framework. Our framework removes the need to obtain the strain from
numerical relativity simulations therefore avoiding the associated systematic
errors.

formed between the interacting nuclei are the keys to understanding the complex
fusion process dynamics.
  Purpose: This work intends to explore the fusion barrier characteristics of
different target-projectile combinations within the relativistic mean-field
(RMF) formalism.
  Methods: The density distributions of interacting nuclei and the microscopic
R3Y NN interaction are obtained from relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism
for non-linear NL1, NL3, TM1, and relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB)
approach for DDME2 parameter sets. The fusion and/or capture cross-section for
the different reaction systems is calculated using the well-known $\ell$-summed
Wong model.
  Results: The barrier height and position of 24 heavy-ion reaction systems are
obtained for different nuclear density distributions and effective NN
interaction potentials. The comparison of fusion and/or capture cross-section
obtained from the $\ell$-summed Wong model is made with the available
experimental data.
  Conclusions: The phenomenological M3Y NN potential is observed to give higher
barrier heights than the relativistic R3Y NN potential for all the reaction
systems. The comparison of results obtained from different relativistic
parameter sets shows that the densities from NL1 and TM1 parameter sets give
the lowest and highest barrier heights for all the systems under study. We
observed higher barrier heights and lower cross-sections for DDR3Y NN potential
as compared to density-independent R3Y NN potentials obtained for considered
non-linear NL1, NL3 and TM1 parameter sets. According to the present analysis,
it is concluded that the NL1 and NL3 parameter sets provide comparatively
better overlap with the experimental fusion and/or capture cross-section than
the TM1 and DDME2 parameter sets.

Snoopy achieves approximately 90% accuracy when evaluated on most websites,

the sharp images from the blurred images. Our method is able to successfully

picked randomly with respect to the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\frac\beta 2H_n}$,
$H_n=\sum_{i\ne j}\log\frac 1{|x_i-x_j|}+n\sum_{i=1}^n\tfrac 12x_i^2.$ The
point process $\{x_j\}_1^n$ tends to follow the semicircle law
$\sigma(x)=\tfrac 1{2\pi}\sqrt{(4-x^2)_+}$ in certain average senses.
  A Fekete configuration (minimizer of $H_n$) is spread out in a much more
uniform way in the interval $[-2,2]$ with respect to the regularization
$\sigma_n(x)=\max\{\sigma(x),n^{-\frac 1 3}\}$ of the semicircle law. In
particular, Fekete configurations are ""equidistributed"" with respect to
$\sigma_n(x)$, in a certain technical sense of Beurling-Landau densities.
  We consider the problem of characterizing sequences $\beta_n$ of inverse
temperatures, which guarantee almost sure equidistribution as $n\to\infty$. We
find that a necessary and sufficient condition is that $\beta_n$ grows at least
logarithmically in $n$: $$\beta_n\gtrsim \log n.$$ We call this growth rate the
perfect freezing regime. We give several further results on the distribution of
particles when $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$, for example on minimal spacing,
discrepancies, and sampling and interpolation for weighted polynomials.
  The condition $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$ was introduced by some of the authors in
the context of two-dimensional Coulomb gas ensembles, where it is shown to be
sufficient for equidistribution. Although the technical implementation requires
some considerable modifications, the strategy from dimension two adapts well to
prove sufficiency also for one-dimensional Gaussian ensembles. On a technical
level, we use estimates for weighted polynomials due to Levin, Lubinsky,
Gustavsson and others. The other direction (necessity) involves estimates due
to Ledoux and Rider on the distribution of particles which fall near or outside
the boundary.

doubling every 3-4 months. Currently, the relationship between the DL model
configuration and energy consumption is not well established. At a general
computational energy model level, there is both strong dependency to both the
hardware architecture (e.g. generic processors with different configuration of
inner components- CPU and GPU, programmable integrated circuits - FPGA), as
well as different interacting energy consumption aspects (e.g., data movement,
calculation, control). At the DL model level, we need to translate non-linear
activation functions and its interaction with data into calculation tasks.
Current methods mainly linearize nonlinear DL models to approximate its
theoretical FLOPs and MACs as a proxy for energy consumption. Yet, this is
inaccurate (est. 93\% accuracy) due to the highly nonlinear nature of many
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for example.
  In this paper, we develop a bottom-level Transistor Operations (TOs) method

models into ALU calculation tasks and then TO steps. This is then statistically
linked to real energy consumption values via a regression model for different

proposed adding stochasticity to actions, separating exploration and
exploitation phases, or equating reduction in uncertainty with reward. However,
these techniques do not necessarily offer entirely systematic approaches making
this trade-off. Here we introduce SElective Reinforcement Exploration Network
(SEREN) that poses the exploration-exploitation trade-off as a game between an
RL agent -- \exploiter, which purely exploits known rewards, and another RL
agent -- \switcher, which chooses at which states to activate a pure
exploration policy that is trained to minimise system uncertainty and override
Exploiter. Using a form of policies known as impulse control, \switcher is able
to determine the best set of states to switch to the exploration policy while
Exploiter is free to execute its actions everywhere else. We prove that SEREN
converges quickly and induces a natural schedule towards pure exploitation.
Through extensive empirical studies in both discrete (MiniGrid) and continuous
(MuJoCo) control benchmarks, we show that SEREN can be readily combined with
existing RL algorithms to yield significant improvement in performance relative
to state-of-the-art algorithms.

locality (tendency of edges to connect vertices that are already close). We
compare this with the performance on generated networks with varying locality

satisfy several exact conditions and physical constraints, such as density
scaling, spin scaling, and derivative discontinuity. In this work, we
demonstrate that contrastive learning is a computationally efficient and
flexible method to incorporate a physical constraint in ML-based density
functional design. We propose a schematic approach to incorporate the uniform
density scaling property of electron density for exchange energies by adopting
contrastive representation learning during the pretraining task. The pretrained
hidden representation is transferred to the downstream task to predict the
exchange energies calculated by DFT. The electron density encoder transferred
from the pretraining task based on contrastive learning predicts exchange
energies that satisfy the scaling property, while the model trained without
using contrastive learning gives poor predictions for the scaling-transformed
electron density systems. Furthermore, the model with pretrained encoder gives
a satisfactory performance with only small fractions of the whole augmented
dataset labeled, comparable to the model trained from scratch using the whole
dataset. The results demonstrate that incorporating exact constraints through
contrastive learning can enhance the understanding of density-energy mapping
using neural network (NN) models with less data labeling, which will be
beneficial to generalizing the application of NN-based XC functionals in a wide
range of scenarios that are not always available experimentally but
theoretically justified. This work represents a viable pathway toward the

molecular dynamics in determining the influence functional coefficients for
subsequent system-solvent simulations. The accuracy of the original procedure

  Market with Energy Hub",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The concept of Energy Hub (EH) has been emerged to accommodate renewable
energy sources in a multi-energy system to deploy the synergies between
electricity and other energy sources. However, the market mechanisms for the
integration of the EHs into the energy markets are not sufficiently elaborated.
This paper proposes a flow-based two-level distributed trading mechanism in the
regional electricity market with EH. At the lower level, the regional system
operator coordinates the regional grids transactions in two markets, the local
energy market with EH and the wholesale market of the upstream grid. Every
nodal agent as an independent stakeholder leverages price discrepancy to cross
arbitrage from different markets. At the upper level, the EH is a third player
intending to maximize profit from trading in the regional electricity market
and gas market. The regional electricity market clearing problem is formulated
as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, for which we develop an
ADMM-based distributed algorithm to obtain the equilibrium solution. The DC
power flow is decomposed into optimization problems for the regional system
operator and agents at different nodes, which can be solved in a distributed
manner to achieve global optimality without violating the privacy of players.
Case studies based on a realistic regional grid verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm and show that the mechanism is effective in decomposing
power flow and increasing energy efficiency.

full pair-wise similarities and therefore reduce the complexity of graph

approaches do not pay sufficient attention to establishing correct
correspondences between the anchor sets across views. To be specific, anchor
graphs obtained from different views are not aligned column-wisely. Such an
\textbf{A}nchor-\textbf{U}naligned \textbf{P}roblem (AUP) would cause
inaccurate graph fusion and degrade the clustering performance. Under
multi-view scenarios, generating correct correspondences could be extremely
difficult since anchors are not consistent in feature dimensions. To solve this
challenging issue, we propose the first study of the generalized and flexible
anchor graph fusion framework termed \textbf{F}ast \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew
\textbf{A}nchor-\textbf{C}orrespondence \textbf{C}lustering (FMVACC).
Specifically, we show how to find anchor correspondence with both feature and

column-wisely. Moreover, we theoretically show the connection between FMVACC

existing multi-view anchor graph competitors indicating the importance of

improved via hydrogenation with atomic hydrogen (referred to as borophane).
However, the precise adsorption structures and the underlying mechanism are
still elusive. Employing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the
optimal configurations of freestanding borophanes and the ones grown on
metallic substrates. For freestanding {\beta}12 and {\chi}3 borophenes, the
energetically favored hydrogen adsorption sites are on the top of the boron
atoms with CN=4 (CN: coordination number), while the best absorption sites for
{\alpha}' borophene are on the top of the boron atoms with CN=6. With various
metal substrates, the hydrogenation configurations of borophene are modulated
significantly, attributed to the chemical hybridization strength between B pz

borophenes and facilitate the stabilization of two-dimensional boron polymorphs

existing graph neural networks yield effective graph representations of a
single graph, little effort has been made for jointly learning two graph
representations and calculating their similarity score. In addition, existing
unsupervised graph similarity learning methods are mainly clustering-based,
which ignores the valuable information embodied in graph pairs. To this end, we
propose a contrastive graph matching network (CGMN) for self-supervised graph
similarity learning in order to calculate the similarity between any two input
graph objects. Specifically, we generate two augmented views for each graph in
a pair respectively. Then, we employ two strategies, namely cross-view
interaction and cross-graph interaction, for effective node representation
learning. The former is resorted to strengthen the consistency of node
representations in two views. The latter is utilized to identify node
differences between different graphs. Finally, we transform node
representations into graph-level representations via pooling operations for
graph similarity computation. We have evaluated CGMN on eight real-world
datasets, and the experiment results show that the proposed new approach is
superior to the state-of-the-art methods in graph similarity learning

refinements in the finite-size modeling are shown to impact mostly the
composition of the nuclear clusters ($Z_{cl}$, $N_{cl}$) in an ordering which

infinite time horizon a system modeling the interactions between a viscous
incompressible fluid and the deformation of a soap bubble. The latter is
represented by an interface separating a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^2$ into
two connected parts filled with viscous incompressible fluids. The interface is
a smooth perturbation of the 1-sphere, and the surrounding fluids satisfy the
incompressible Stokes equations in time-dependent domains. The mean curvature
of the surface defines a surface tension force which induces a jump of the
normal trace of the Cauchy stress tensor. The response of the fluids is a
velocity trace on the interface, governing the time evolution of the latter,
via the equality of velocities. The data are assumed to be sufficiently small,
in particular the initial perturbation, that is the initial shape of the soap
bubble is close enough to a circle. The control function is a surface tension
type force on the interface. We design it as the sum of two feedback operators:
one is explicit, the second one is finite-dimensional. They enable us to define
a control operator that stabilizes locally the soap bubble to a circle with an
arbitrary exponential decay rate, up to translations, and up to non-contact
with the outer boundary.

multiqubit states using only a limited number of Wehrl moments (moments of the
Husimi function of the state) as input, which represents partial information
about the state. We consider both pure and mixed quantum states. We compare the
results we obtain by training ANNs with the informed use of convergence
acceleration methods. We find that even some of the most powerful convergence
acceleration algorithms do not compete with ANNs when given the same input
data, provided that enough data is available to train these ANNs. More
generally, this work opens up perspectives for the estimation of entanglement
measures and other SU(2) invariant quantities, such as Wehrl entropy, on the
basis of a few Wehrl moments which contain less information than the full
quantum state.

Device-to-Device (D2D) communications is a powerful tool for reducing
congestion, energy consumption, and spectrum usage of mobile cellular networks.
Prior network-level studies on D2D data offloading focus on high level
performance metrics as the offloading efficiency, and take into account the
radio propagation aspects by using simplistic wireless channel models. We
consider a D2D data offloading protocol tailored to highly dynamic scenarios as
vehicular environments, and evaluate its performance focusing on physical layer
aspects, like energy consumption and spectral efficiency. We do this by taking
into account more realistic models of the wireless channel, with respect to the
simplistic ones generally used in the previous studies. Our objective is
twofold: first, to quantify the performance gain of the considered D2D
offloading protocol with respect to a classic cellular network, based on I2D
communications, in terms of energy consumption and spectral efficiency. Second,
to show that using simplistic channel models may prevent to accurately evaluate
the performance gain. Additionally, the use of more elaborated models allows to
obtain insightful information on relevant system-level parameters settings,
which would not be possible to obtain by using simple models. The considered
channel models have been proposed and validated, in the recent years, through
large-scale measurements campaigns.
  Our results show that the considered protocol is able to achieve a reduction
in the energy consumption of up to 35%, and an increase in the system spectral
efficiency of 50%, with respect to the benchmark cellular system. The use of
different channel models in evaluating these metrics may result, in the worst
case, in a sixfold underestimation of the achieved improvement.

for ICU mortality prediction. Hereby, the applicability of federated learning
as an alternative to centralized machine learning and local machine learning is
investigated by introducing federated learning to the binary classification
problem of predicting ICU mortality. We extract multivariate time series data
from the MIMIC-III database (lab values and vital signs), and benchmark the
predictive performance of four deep sequential classifiers (FRNN, LSTM, GRU,

the number of FL clients (2, 4, 8). The experiments demonstrate that both
centralized machine learning and federated learning are comparable in terms of
AUPRC and F1-score. Furthermore, the federated approach shows superior
performance over local machine learning. Thus, the federated approach can be
seen as a valid and privacy-preserving alternative to centralized machine

this paper, we propose a new approach called Event Chains Computation (ECC) to
model the unslotted CSMA/CA algorithm used for channel access in NBE mode. ECC
relies on the idea that outcomes of the CSMA/CA algorithm can be represented as
chains of events that subsequently occur in the network. Although ECC can
generate all the possible outcomes, it only considers chains with a probability
to occur greater than a pre-defined threshold to reduce complexity.
Furthermore, ECC parallelizes the computation by managing different chains
through different threads. Our results show that, by an appropriate threshold
selection, the time to derive performance metrics can be drastically reduced,
with negligible impact on accuracy. We also show that the computation time
decreases almost linearly with the number of employed threads. We validate our
model through simulations and testbed experiments, and use it to investigate
the impact of different parameters on the WSN performance, in terms of delivery
ratio, latency, and energy consumption.

multiple changes in resonant lines caused by dissipating extinction in our line
of sight. The FUV flux has increased nearly ten-fold which has led to increased
ionization of the multiple shells within the Homunculus and photo-destruction
of molecular hydrogen. Comparison of observed resonant line profiles with
CMFGEN model profiles allows separation of wind-wind collision and shell
absorptions from the primary wind, P Cygni profiles.The dissipating occulter
preferentially obscured the central binary and interacting winds relative to
the very extended primary wind. We are now able to monitor changes in the
colliding winds with orbital phase. High velocity transient absorptions
occurred across the most recent periastron passage, indicating acceleration of
the primary wind by the secondary wind which leads to a downstream, high
velocity bowshock that is newly generated every orbital period. There is no
evidence of changes in the properties of the binary winds.

An expected
consequence of fast rotation is strong internal mixing that deeply affects
their evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and hence their
ionising power. aims: We investigate the impact on the ionising power of Pop
III stars in an extreme case of internal mixing, the one leading to chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE). In that situation, during the main sequence phase,
the star keeps the same chemical composition from its center to its surface.
Homogeneous stars have larger effective temperatures and luminosities than
stars evolving non-homogeneously and thus are stronger ionising sources.
Methods: The stellar evolution models are based on $n=3$ polytropes with a time
varying hydrogen mass fraction. The ionisation model employs the self-similar
champagne flow solution from Shu et al. (2002), as well as numerical
simulations for the stochastic treatment of star clusters over a grid of
redshifts and halo masses. Results: We find that haloes containing chemically
homogeneous stars have an escape fraction of ionising photons about twice that
of haloes containing classical Pop III stars. By extrapolating the high-$z$
ionisation history powered by Pop III stars (at $z\gtrsim 15$) to the
post-reionisation epoch, we derive the Thomson scattering optical depth $\tau$,
which is compared with the value measured by $\textit{Planck}$. We find that
$\tau$ is overproduced by $\sim1.5- 5\sigma$, when all Pop III stars evolve
homogeneously. This indicates that CHE is unlikely to be realised in the
majority of Pop III stars, although the present study cannot exclude that a
fraction of them undergoes CHE. Conclusions: Fast rotation might have a
significant impact on the ionising budget of Pop III stars, and thus on early
cosmic reionisation.

space caused by complex game elements. State abstraction is a popular technique
that reduces the state space complexity. However, current state abstraction
methods for games depend on domain knowledge, making their application to new
games expensive. State abstraction methods that require no domain knowledge are
studied extensively in the planning domain. However, no evidence shows they
scale well with the complexity of strategy games. In this paper, we propose
Elastic MCTS, an algorithm that uses state abstraction to play strategy games.
In Elastic MCTS, the nodes of the tree are clustered dynamically, first grouped
together progressively by state abstraction, and then separated when an
iteration threshold is reached. The elastic changes benefit from efficient
searching brought by state abstraction but avoid the negative influence of
using state abstraction for the whole search. To evaluate our method, we make
use of the general strategy games platform Stratega to generate scenarios of
varying complexity. Results show that Elastic MCTS outperforms MCTS baselines
with a large margin, while reducing the tree size by a factor of $10$. Code can

over-smoothing. Among all the attempts to prevent over-smoothing, residual
connection is one of the promising methods due to its simplicity. However,
recent studies have shown that GNNs with residual connections only slightly
slow down the degeneration. The reason why residual connections fail in GNNs is
still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the forward and backward behavior
of GNNs with residual connections from a novel path decomposition perspective.
We find that the recursive aggregation of the median length paths from the
binomial distribution of residual connection paths dominates output
representation, resulting in over-smoothing as GNNs go deeper. Entangled
propagation and weight matrices cause gradient smoothing and prevent GNNs with
residual connections from optimizing to the identity mapping. Based on these
findings, we present a Universal Deep GNNs (UDGNN) framework with cold-start
adaptive residual connections (DRIVE) and feedforward modules. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves
state-of-the-art results over non-smooth heterophily datasets by simply
stacking standard GNNs.

examples (RealAEs), i.e., AEs that satisfy the domain constraints of Android
malware. However, existing work focuses on generating RealAEs in the problem
space, which is known to be time-consuming and impractical for adversarial
training. In this paper, we propose to generate RealAEs in the feature space,
leading to a simpler and more efficient solution. Our approach is driven by a
novel interpretation of Android malware properties in the feature space. More
concretely, we extract feature-space domain constraints by learning meaningful
feature dependencies from data and applying them by constructing a robust
feature space. Our experiments on DREBIN, a well-known Android malware
detector, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
defense, Sec-SVM, against realistic gradient- and query-based attacks.
Additionally, we demonstrate that generating feature-space RealAEs is faster
than generating problem-space RealAEs, indicating its high applicability in
adversarial training. We further validate the ability of our learned
feature-space domain constraints in representing the Android malware properties
by showing that (i) re-training detectors with our feature-space RealAEs
largely improves model performance on similar problem-space RealAEs and (ii)
using our feature-space domain constraints can help distinguish RealAEs from
unrealizable AEs (unRealAEs).

critical challenges: (1) generalizing to diverse data distributions given
limited training data while (2) maintaining interpretability. To address these
challenges, we propose an instance-weighted tree-sum method that effectively
pools data across diverse groups to output a concise, rule-based model. Given
distinct groups of instances in a dataset (e.g., medical patients grouped by
age or treatment site), our method first estimates group membership
probabilities for each instance. Then, it uses these estimates as instance
weights in FIGS (Tan et al. 2022), to grow a set of decision trees whose values
sum to the final prediction. We call this new method Group Probability-Weighted
Tree Sums (G-FIGS). G-FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on
important clinical datasets; e.g., holding the level of sensitivity fixed at
92%, G-FIGS increases specificity for identifying cervical spine injury by up
to 10% over CART and up to 3% over FIGS alone, with larger gains at higher
sensitivity levels. By keeping the total number of rules below 16 in FIGS, the
final models remain interpretable, and we find that their rules match medical
domain expertise. All code, data, and models are released on Github.

optimal complexity of gradient calls of $p$ and $q$, that is,
  $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L_p/\mu})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L_q/\mu})$,

studies have been brought by considering text, propagation and user profiles.
Due to the data collection problem, these methods based on propagation and user
profiles are less applicable in the early stages. A good alternative method is
to detect news based on text as soon as they are released, and a lot of
text-based methods were proposed, which usually utilized words, sentences or
paragraphs as basic units. But, word is a too fine-grained unit to express
coherent information well, sentence or paragraph is too coarse to show specific
information. Which granularity is better and how to utilize it to enhance text
representation for fake news detection are two key problems. In this paper, we
introduce Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) whose granularity is between word and
sentence, and propose a multi-EDU-structure awareness model to improve text
representation for fake news detection, namely EDU4FD. For the
multi-EDU-structure awareness, we build the sequence-based EDU representations
and the graph-based EDU representations. The former is gotten by modeling the
coherence between consecutive EDUs with TextCNN that reflect the semantic
coherence. For the latter, we first extract rhetorical relations to build the
EDU dependency graph, which can show the global narrative logic and help
deliver the main idea truthfully. Then a Relation Graph Attention Network
(RGAT) is set to get the graph-based EDU representation. Finally, the two EDU
representations are incorporated as the enhanced text representation for fake
news detection, using a gated recursive unit combined with a global attention
mechanism. Experiments on four cross-source fake news datasets show that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art text-based methods.

effect process with respect to a pair of temporal patterns. In particular, our
framework can be used to study causal effects in the frequency domain. We will
see how our approach compares to the well known Granger Causality in the
frequency domain. Furthermore, using a singular value decomposition we
establish a representation of how one process drives another over a time-window

anisotropic classical Heisenberg XY and XXZ models with ferromagnetic exchange
on a square lattice and antiferromagnetic exchange on a triangular lattice
using an unsupervised machine learning approach called principal component
analysis (PCA). In earlier studies of the BKT transition, spin configurations
and vorticities calculated from Monte Carlo method are used to determine the
transition temperature $T_{BKT}$, but those methods fail to give any conclusive
results by analyzing the principal components in the PCA approach. In this work
vorticities are used as initial input to the PCA and curve of the first
principal component with temperature is fitted with a function to determine an
accurate value of $T_{BKT}$. This procedure works well for anisotropic
classical Heisenberg with ferromagnetic exchange on square lattice as well as
for frustrated antiferromagnetic exchange on a triangular lattice. The
classical anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the triangular
lattice has two close transitions; the BKT at $T_{BKT}$ and Ising like phase
transition for chirality at $T_c$ and it is difficult to separate these
transition points. It is also noted that using the PCA method and manipulation
of their first principal component, not only separation of transition points

penalized splines. The best value of the smoothing parameter is often the one
that optimizes a smoothness selection criterion, such as generalized
cross-validation error (GCV) and restricted likelihood (REML). To correctly
identify the global optimum rather than being trapped in an undesired local
optimum, grid search is recommended for optimization. Unfortunately, the grid
search method requires a pre-specified search interval that contains the
unknown global optimum, yet no guideline is available for providing this
interval. As a result, practitioners have to find it by trial and error. To
overcome such difficulty, we develop novel algorithms to automatically find
this interval. Our automatic search interval has four advantages. (i) It
specifies a smoothing parameter range where the associated penalized least
squares problem is numerically solvable. (ii) It is criterion-independent so
that different criteria, such as GCV and REML, can be explored on the same
parameter range. (iii) It is sufficiently wide to contain the global optimum of
any criterion, so that for example, the global minimum of GCV and the global
maximum of REML can both be identified. (iv) It is computationally cheap
compared with the grid search itself, carrying no extra computational burden in
practice. Our method is ready to use through our recently developed R package
gps (>= version 1.1). It may be embedded in more advanced statistical modeling

a function of the longitudinal coordinates, which is a longitudinal detuning.
An example of transverse detuning are the tune shifts due to octupole magnets.
This paper considers a pulsed electron lens as a measure to mitigate the
head-tail instabilities. Using a detailed analytical description within a
Vlasov formalism, the coherent properties of the longitudinal and transverse
detuning are presented. The analytical predictions are compared with the
results of the particle tracking simulations. A pulsed electron lens is
demonstrated to be a source of tune spread with two components: a static one,
leading to Landau damping; and a dynamic one, leading to an effective impedance
modification, which we demonstrate analytically and in our particle tracking
simulations. The effective impedance modification can be important for beam
stability due to devices causing a longitudinal detuning, especially for
nonzero head-tail modes. The Vlasov formalism is extended to include the
combination of longitudinal and transverse detuning. As a possible application
at the SIS100 heavy-ion synchrotron (FAIR at GSI Darmstadt, Germany), a
combination of a pulsed electron lens with octupole magnets is considered.

slowly and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load,
leading to conflicting requirements for their actuators. An actuator with
multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, can address this issue by allowing
an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However, having
discrete modes of operation adds complexity to the high-level control and
planning. Here a controller for two-speed actuators that automatically select
both the best gear ratio and the motor torque is developed. The approach is to:
first derive a low-dimensional model, then use dynamic programming to find the
best actions for all possible situations, and last use regression analysis to
extract simplified global feedback laws. This approach produces simple
practical nearly-optimal feedback laws. A controller that globally minimizes a
quadratic cost function is derived for a two-speed actuator prototype, global
stability is proven and performance is demonstrated experimentally.

Yet, the exact link between the 8 micron emission and the young stellar
populations in galaxies is still under question, as dust grains can be
stochastically heated also by older field stars. In order to investigate this
link, we have combined mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope
with a published star cluster candidates catalog for the Local Group galaxy
M33. M33 is sufficiently close that the Spitzer's 8 micron images resolve
individual regions of star formation. Star clusters represent almost-single-age
stellar populations, which are significantly easier to model than more complex
mixtures of stars. We find a decrease in the 8 micron luminosity per unit
stellar mass as a function of age of the star clusters, with a large scatter
that is consistent with varying fractions of stellar light absorbed by dust.
The decrease and scatter both confirm findings based on more distant galaxies
and are well described by simple models for the dust emission of a young
stellar population. We conclude that the dust emission at 8 micron depends
sensitively on the age of the stellar population, out to at least the oldest
age analyzed here, ~400 Myr. This dependence complicates the use of the 8
micron emission as a star formation rate indicator, at least for small galactic
regions and individual star forming regions. By leveraging the Spitzer legacy,
this investigation paves the way for future explorations with the James Webb

  Tensors","Citation fix",,,,"cs.CC math.AG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since the seminal works of Strassen and Valiant it has been a central theme
in algebraic complexity theory to understand the relative complexity of
algebraic problems, that is, to understand which algebraic problems (be it
bilinear maps like matrix multiplication in Strassen's work, or the determinant
and permanent polynomials in Valiant's) can be reduced to each other (under the
appropriate notion of reduction).
  In this paper we determine precisely how many independent scalar
multiplications can be reduced to a given bilinear map (this number is called
the subrank, and extends the concept of matrix diagonalization to tensors), for
essentially all (i.e. generic) bilinear maps. Namely, we prove for a generic
bilinear map $T : V \times V \to V$ where $\dim(V) = n$ that $\theta(\sqrt{n})$
independent scalar multiplications can be reduced to $T$. Our result
significantly improves on the previous upper bound from the work of Strassen
(1991) and B\""urgisser (1990) which was $n^{2/3 + o(1)}$. Our full result is
much more general and applies not only to bilinear maps and 3-tensors but also
to $k$-tensors, for which we find that the generic subrank is
$\theta(n^{1/(k-1)})$. Moreover, as an application we prove that the subrank is
not additive under the direct sum.
  The subrank plays a central role in several areas of complexity theory
(matrix multiplication algorithms, barrier results) and combinatorics (e.g.,
the cap set problem and sunflower problem). As a consequence of our result we
obtain several large separations between the subrank and tensor methods that
have received much interest recently, notably the slice rank (Tao, 2016),
analytic rank (Gowers--Wolf, 2011; Lovett, 2018;

cancer lesions to CT scans. Because the tampering region may even account for
less than 1\% of the original image, even state-of-the-art methods are
challenging to detect the traces of such tampering.
  This paper proposes a cascade framework to detect GAN-based medical image
small region forgery like CT-GAN. In the local detection stage, we train the
detector network with small sub-images so that interference information in
authentic regions will not affect the detector. We use depthwise separable
convolution and residual to prevent the detector from over-fitting and enhance
the ability to find forged regions through the attention mechanism. The
detection results of all sub-images in the same image will be combined into a
heatmap. In the global classification stage, using gray level co-occurrence
matrix (GLCM) can better extract features of the heatmap. Because the shape and
size of the tampered area are uncertain, we train PCA and SVM methods for
classification. Our method can classify whether a CT image has been tampered
and locate the tampered position. Sufficient experiments show that our method
can achieve excellent performance.

The emitting source size, composed of a core radius anchored to the

mobility in the GFETs can be directly characterized and studied using the
geometrical magnetoresistance (gMR) effect. The method is free from the
limitations of other approaches since it does not require an assumption of the
constant mobility and the knowledge of the gate capacitance. Studies of a few
sets of GFETs in the wide range of transverse magnetic fields indicate that the
gMR effect dominates up to approximately 0.55 T. In higher fields, the physical
magnetoresistance effect starts to contribute. The advantages of the gMR
approach allowed us to interpret the measured dependencies of mobility on the
gate voltage, i.e., carrier concentration, and identify the corresponding
scattering mechanisms. In particular, the range of the fairly constant mobility
is associated with the dominating Coulomb scattering. The decrease in mobility
at higher carrier concentrations is associated with the contribution of the
phonon scattering. Analysis shows that the gMR mobility is typically 2-3 times
higher than that found via the commonly used drain resistance model. The latter
underestimates the mobility since it does not take the interfacial capacitance
into account.

efficient testing for configurable systems. This is achieved by generating a
small yet representative sample of configurations for a system, which
circumvents testing the entire solution space. However, by design, most recent
approaches for t-wise interaction sampling only consider combinations of
configuration options from a configurable system's variability model and do not
take into account their mapping onto the solution space, thus potentially
leaving critical implementation artifacts untested. Tartler et al. address this
problem by considering presence conditions of implementation artifacts rather
than pure configuration options, but do not consider the possible interactions
between these artifacts. In this paper, we introduce t-wise presence condition
coverage, which extends the approach of Tartler et al. by using presence
conditions extracted from the code as basis to cover t-wise interactions. This
ensures that all t-wise interactions of implementation artifacts are included
in the sample and that the chance of detecting combinations of faulty
configuration options is increased. We evaluate our approach in terms of
testing efficiency and testing effectiveness by comparing the approach to
existing t-wise interaction sampling techniques. We show that t-wise presence
condition sampling is able to produce mostly smaller samples compared to t-wise
interaction sampling, while guaranteeing a t-wise presence condition coverage
of 100%.

  Clustering",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Time series clustering is the act of grouping time series data without
recourse to a label. Algorithms that cluster time series can be classified into
two groups: those that employ a time series specific distance measure; and
those that derive features from time series. Both approaches usually rely on
traditional clustering algorithms such as $k$-means. Our focus is on distance
based time series that employ elastic distance measures, i.e. distances that
perform some kind of realignment whilst measuring distance. We describe nine
commonly used elastic distance measures and compare their performance with
k-means and k-medoids clustering. Our findings are surprising. The most popular
technique, dynamic time warping (DTW), performs worse than Euclidean distance
with k-means, and even when tuned, is no better. Using k-medoids rather than
k-means improved the clusterings for all nine distance measures. DTW is not
significantly better than Euclidean distance with k-medoids. Generally,
distance measures that employ editing in conjunction with warping perform
better, and one distance measure, the move-split-merge (MSM) method, is the
best performing measure of this study. We also compare to clustering with DTW
using barycentre averaging (DBA). We find that DBA does improve DTW k-means,
but that the standard DBA is still worse than using MSM. Our conclusion is to
recommend MSM with k-medoids as the benchmark algorithm for clustering time
series with elastic distance measures. We provide implementations in the aeon

this paper proposes a novel vehicle routing algorithm that improves upon
Dijkstra's algorithm using a traffic prediction model based on the traffic flow
in a road network. Here, Dijkstra's algorithm is adapted to be dynamic and time
dependent using traffic flow theory principles during the planning stage
itself. The model provides predicted traffic parameters and travel time across
each edge of the road network at every time instant, leading to better routing
results. The dynamic algorithm proposed here predicts changes in traffic
conditions at each time step of planning to give the optimal forward-looking

Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with randomly simulated traffic, and is shown
to predict the optimal route better with continuously changing traffic.

By contrast, it is a long-standing open problem to find the largest

the maximum size is achieved by the previously conjectured extremal examples,
namely families of the form $\{\pi~|~\pi(x)\in I, \pi(I)\cap I=\emptyset\}$ and
their inverses. Moreover, we show that the maximum size is only achieved by

invariant representations might allow us to learn models with
out-of-distribution guarantees, i.e., models that are robust to interventions

We study the following question: If a representation is approximately invariant
with respect to a given number of training interventions, will it continue to
be approximately invariant on a larger collection of unseen SEMs? This larger
collection of SEMs is generated through a parameterized family of
interventions. Inspired by PAC learning, we obtain finite-sample

holds \textit{probabilistically} over a family of linear SEMs without
faithfulness assumptions. Our results show bounds that do not scale in ambient

tasks of computer vision. However, over-parameterized representations of
popular architectures dramatically increase their computational complexity and
storage costs, and hinder their availability in edge devices with constrained
resources. Regardless of many tensor decomposition (TD) methods that have been
well-studied for compressing DNNs to learn compact representations, they suffer
from non-negligible performance degradation in practice. In this paper, we
propose Scalable Tensorizing Networks (STN), which dynamically and adaptively
adjust the model size and decomposition structure without retraining. First, we
account for compression during training by adding a low-rank regularizer to
guarantee networks' desired low-rank characteristics in full tensor format.
Then, considering network layers exhibit various low-rank structures, STN is
obtained by a data-driven adaptive TD approach, for which the topological
structure of decomposition per layer is learned from the pre-trained model, and
the ranks are selected appropriately under specified storage constraints. As a
result, STN is compatible with arbitrary network architectures and achieves
higher compression performance and flexibility over other tensorizing versions.
Comprehensive experiments on several popular architectures and benchmarks
substantiate the superiority of our model towards improving parameter
efficiency.

Available transfer devices, like floor lifts, lead to improvements but are far

This paper presents a new motorised floor lift with a single central motorised

controller designs, one with a linear admittance law and a non-linear
admittance law with variable damping, were developed and implemented on a
prototype. Tests were performed on seven participants to evaluate the
performance of the assistance system and the controllers. The experimental
results show that 1) the motorised assistance with the variable damping
controller improves manoeuvrability by 28%, 2) reduces the amount of effort
required to push the lift by 66% and 3) provides the same level of patient

spring coefficients. We find that, in the red-detuned and weak-coupling
regimes, a frequency-dependent effective cavity damping rate (ECDR) is induced

retarded Green's function obtained in the framework of a generalized linear

negative CPSF can be realized by controlling the cooperativities and modulation
parameters while the system still remains in the stable regime. Nevertheless,
such a negativity never occurs in a standard cavity optomechanical system.
Besides, we find that the presence of two modulated mechanical degrees of

for systems out of Onsager's region that respect the existing thermodynamic
theorems for systems far from equilibrium. To this aim, a thermodynamic theory
for irreversible processes [referred to as the Thermodynamical Field Theory
(TFT)] has been developed. The TFT rests upon the concept of equivalence
between thermodynamic systems: ""The equivalent character of two alternative
descriptions of a thermodynamic system is ensured if, and only if, the entropy
production and the Glansdorff-Prigogine dissipative quantity remain unaltered
under the thermodynamic forces transformation"". The TCT leads naturally to the
""Thermodynamic Covariance Principle"" (TCP) stating that ""The nonlinear closure
equations, i.e., the flux-force relations, must be covariant under TCT"". In
this work, we provide the explicit expression of the nonlinear PDEs, subjected
to the appropriate boundary conditions, which have to be satisfied by transport
coefficients when the skew-symmetric piece is absent. The solution of these
equations allows to determine the flux-force closure relations for systems out
of the Onsager region. Since the proposed PDEs are obtained without neglecting
any term present in the balance equations (i.e., the mass, momentum, and energy
balance equations), we propose them as a good candidate for describing
transport in thermodynamic systems also in turbulent regime. A preliminary test
is carried out by analysing a concrete example where Onsager's relations
manifestly disagree with experience: losses in magnetically confined
Tokamak-plasmas in fully collisional and in turbulent regimes. We show the good
agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data. The
aim is to apply our approach to the ""Divertor Tokamak Test facility"" (DTT), to

graph-structured data, various GNN-based methods have been introduced to learn
from knowledge graphs (KGs). In this paper, to reveal the key factors
underneath existing GNN-based methods, we revisit exemplar works from the lens
of the propagation path. We find that the answer entity can be close to queried
one, but the information dependency can be long. Thus, better reasoning
performance can be obtained by exploring longer propagation paths. However,
identifying such a long-range dependency in KG is hard since the number of
involved entities grows exponentially. This motivates us to learn an adaptive
propagation path that filters out irrelevant entities while preserving
promising targets during the propagation. First, we design an incremental
sampling mechanism where the close and promising target can be preserved.
Second, we design a learning-based sampling distribution to identify the
targets with fewer involved entities. In this way, GNN can go deeper to capture
long-range information. Extensive experiments show that our method is efficient
and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both transductive and inductive
reasoning settings, benefiting from the deeper propagation.

the spatial curvature within the total energy density leads to a growing mode
for it in such a way that its present values are consistent with those reported
in recent observations. We also present a numerical simulation of the model

attacks cause the loss of accuracy for the DNN-based AMC by injecting a
well-designed perturbation to the wireless channels. In this paper, we propose
a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based countermeasure approach to
safeguard the DNN-based AMC systems against adversarial attack examples.
GAN-based aims to eliminate the adversarial attack examples before feeding to
the DNN-based classifier. Specifically, we have shown the resiliency of our
proposed defense GAN against the Fast-Gradient Sign method (FGSM) algorithm as
one of the most potent kinds of attack algorithms to craft the perturbed
signals. The existing defense-GAN has been designed for image classification
and does not work in our case where the above-mentioned communication system is
considered. Thus, our proposed countermeasure approach deploys GANs with a
mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem in a typical GAN
facing radio signal classification problem. Simulation results show the
effectiveness of our proposed defense GAN so that it could enhance the accuracy
of the DNN-based AMC under adversarial attacks to 81%, approximately.

representative example where real-time processing and energy efficiency are
required. Following a brain-inspired computing approach, we propose a new
benchmark for spatio-temporal tactile pattern recognition at the edge through
Braille letter reading. We recorded a new Braille letters dataset based on the
capacitive tactile sensors of the iCub robot's fingertip. We then investigated
the importance of spatial and temporal information as well as the impact of
event-based encoding on spike-based computation. Afterward, we trained and
compared feedforward and recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offline using
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients, then we deployed
them on the Intel Loihi neuromorphic chip for fast and efficient inference. We
compared our approach to standard classifiers, in particular to the Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deployed on the embedded NVIDIA Jetson GPU, in terms
of classification accuracy, power, energy consumption, and delay. Our results
show that the LSTM reaches ~97% of accuracy, outperforming the recurrent SNN by
~17% when using continuous frame-based data instead of event-based inputs.
However, the recurrent SNN on Loihi with event-based inputs is ~500 times more
energy-efficient than the LSTM on Jetson, requiring a total power of only ~30
mW. This work proposes a new benchmark for tactile sensing and highlights the
challenges and opportunities of event-based encoding, neuromorphic hardware,

the mechanical and physical properties of PC using Extreme Gradient Boost
(XGBoost). The compressive strength, tensile strength, density and porosity of
PC was predicted using four models evaluated using different statistical
parameters. These statistical measures are the root mean squared error (RMSE),
square of correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE). The estimation of these properties by the
XGBoost models were in agreement with the experimental measurements. The
performance of XGBoost is further validated by comparing its estimations to
those obtained from four corresponding support vector regression (SVR) models.
The comparison showed that XGBoost generally outperformed SVR with lower RMSE

regarding adverse impacts of wind farm noise (WFN). One of the most annoying
and potentially sleep disturbing components of WFN is amplitude modulation
(AM). Here we quantified and characterised AM over one year using acoustical
and meteorological data measured at three locations near three wind farms. We
found that the diurnal variation of outdoor AM prevalence was substantial, the
nighttime prevalence was approximately 2 to 5 times higher than the daytime
prevalence. On average, indoor AM occurred during the nighttime from 1.1 to 1.7
times less often than outdoor AM, but the indoor AM depth was higher than that
measured outdoors. We observed an association between AM prevalence and sunset
and sunrise. AM occurred more often at downwind and crosswind conditions. These
findings provide important insights into long term WFN characteristics that
will help to inform future WFN assessment guidelines.

We draw insights from Arnold van Gennep's anthropological work 'Les Rites de

group or society to another. Based on Gennep's
separation-transition-incorporation framework, we have identified four phases
of refugee journeys: Arrival of Refugees, Temporal stay at Asylums,
Rehabilitation, and Integration of Refugees into the host nation. We collected
0.23 million multimodal tweets from April 2020 to March 2021 for testing this
proposed frame-work. We find that a combination of transformer-based language
models and state-of-the-art image recognition models, such as fusion of
BERT+LSTM and InceptionV4, can out-perform unimodal models. Subsequently, to
test the practical implication of our proposed model in real-time, we have
considered 0.01 million multimodal tweets related to the 2022 Ukrainian refugee

medical data specific to individuals induces several security issues,
especially in terms of privacy. Even though the owner of the images like a
hospital put in place strict privacy protection provisions at the level of its
information system, the model trained over his images still holds disclosure
potential. The trained model may be accessible to an attacker as: 1) White-box:
accessing to the model architecture and parameters; 2) Black box: where he can
only query the model with his own inputs through an appropriate interface.
Existing attack methods include: feature estimation attacks (FEA), membership
inference attack (MIA), model memorization attack (MMA) and identification
attacks (IA). In this work we focus on MIA against a model that has been
trained to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. Diabetic
retinopathy is a condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in the
people who have diabetes. MIA is the process of determining whether a data
sample comes from the training data set of a trained ML model or not. From a
privacy perspective in our use case where a diabetic retinopathy classification
model is given to partners that have at their disposal images along with
patients' identifiers, inferring the membership status of a data sample can
help to state if a patient has contributed or not to the training of the model.

extraordinary potential is being held back by challenges such as a lack of
medical datasets for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a lack of
trust due to its black box working style. We explored how blockchain technology
can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This
paper has conducted a Systematic Literature Review to explore the
state-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare applications
developed with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This
systematic literature review proceeds with three different paths as natural
language processing-based healthcare systems, computer vision-based healthcare
systems and acoustic AI-based healthcare systems. We found that 1) Defence
techniques for adversarial attacks on AI are available for specific kind of
attacks and even adversarial training is AI based technique which in further
prone to different attacks. 2) Blockchain can address security and privacy
issues in healthcare fraternity. 3) Medical data verification and user
provenance can be enabled with Blockchain. 4) Blockchain can protect
distributed learning on heterogeneous medical data. 5) The issues like single
point of failure, non-transparency in healthcare systems can be resolved with
Blockchain. Nevertheless, it has been identified that research is at the
initial stage. As a result, we have synthesized a conceptual framework using
Blockchain Technology for AI-based healthcare applications that considers the
needs of each NLP, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI application. A global
solution for all sort of adversarial attacks on AI based healthcare. However,
this technique has significant limits and challenges that need to be addressed

Debye prediction, which could help rationalize, e.g., the glasses' unusual
temperature dependence of thermal properties compared to crystalline solids.
The way the density of states of these low-frequency excess modes $D(\omega)$
depends on the frequency $\omega$ has been debated for decades. Recent
simulation studies of 3D glasses suggest that $D(\omega)$ scales universally
with $\omega^4$ in a low-frequency regime below the first sound mode. However,
no simulation study has ever probed as low frequencies as possible to test
directly whether this quartic law could work all the way to extremely low
frequencies. Here, we calculated $D(\omega)$ below the first sound mode in 3D
glasses over a wide range of frequencies. We find $D(\omega)$ scales with
$\omega^{\beta}$ with ${\beta}<4.0$ at very low frequencies examined, while the
$\omega^4$ law works only in a limited intermediate-frequency regime in some
glasses. Moreover, our further analysis suggests our observation does not
depend on glass models or glass stabilities examined. The $\omega^4$ law of
$D(\omega)$ below the first sound mode is dominant in current simulation
studies of 3D glasses, and our direct observation of the breakdown of the
quartic law at very low frequencies thus leaves an open but important question
that may attract more future numerical and theoretical studies.

Searching for the optimal knowledge sharing in DMTL is more challenging for
sequential learning problems, as the task relationship will change in the
temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient
framework called HierarchicalTemporal Activation Network (HTAN) to
simultaneously explore the optimal sharing of the neural network hierarchy
(hierarchical axis) and the time-variant task relationship (temporal axis).
HTAN learns a set of time-variant activation functions to encode the task
relation. A functional regularization implemented by a modulated SPDNet and
adversarial learning is further proposed to enhance the DMTL performance.
Comprehensive experiments on several challenging applications demonstrate that
our HTAN-SPD framework outperforms SOTA methods significantly in sequential

in tandem with legacy terrestrial networks to support uncovered or unserved

Several researchers have published work related to fault diagnosis in rotating

review of literature that focuses more on multi-fault diagnosis of rotating

anti-Semitism, anti-LGBQT hate and QAnon conspiracies. But should 'doing more'
mean doing more of the same, or something different? If so, what? Here we start
by showing why platforms doing more of the same will not solve the problem.
Specifically, our analysis of nearly 100 million Facebook users entangled over
vaccines and now Covid and beyond, shows that the extreme communities' ecology
has a hidden resilience to Facebook's removal interventions; that Facebook's
messaging interventions are missing key audience sectors and getting ridiculed;
that a key piece of these online extremes' narratives is being mislabeled as
incorrect science; and that the threat of censorship is inciting the creation
of parallel presences on other platforms with potentially broader audiences. We
then demonstrate empirically a new solution that can soften online extremes
organically without having to censor or remove communities or their content, or
check or correct facts, or promote any preventative messaging, or seek a
consensus. This solution can be automated at scale across social media
platforms quickly and with minimal cost.
