In this paper, we shall take $G$ to be a finite $p$-group of class two for any
odd prime $p$, in which case $T(G)$ may be studied using certain bilinear
forms. For any $n\geq 4$, we exhibit examples of $G$ of order $p^{n+{n\choose

$p$-groups $G$, the prime factors of the order of $T(G)$ which are known so far
all came from $p(p-1)$. Our examples show that the order of $T(G)$ can have
other prime factors as well. In fact, we can embed any finite group into $T(G)$

joint mediation effects of multiple post-exposure mediating variables.
Identification of such joint mediation effects generally require no unmeasured
confounding of the outcome with respect to the whole set of mediators. As the
number of mediators under consideration grows, this key assumption is likely to
be violated as it is often infeasible to intervene on any of the mediators. In
this paper, we develop a simple two-step method of moments estimation procedure
to assess mediation with multiple mediators simultaneously in the presence of
potential unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding. Our identification result
leverages heterogeneity of the exposure effect on each mediator in the
population, which is plausible under a variety of empirical settings. The
proposed estimators are illustrated through both simulations and an application

address it by incurring additional blocks or complex global representations in

fully encode the RI relative pose information, and a factorized dynamic kernel
for pose-aware kernel generation, which can further reduce the computational

model independent fit of the related scenarios exhibits similar pulls w.r.t.
the Standard Model, is crucial to advance our understanding of the $B$
anomalies. We first identify the origin of the degeneracy of these two cases
and point out the key observables that can break it. In particular, while the
observables measured so far that test lepton flavour universality exhibit
similar dependencies to all the relevant Wilson coefficients, the forthcoming
measurement of $Q_5=P_{5}^{\prime\mu}-P_{5}^{\prime e}$ is particularly
sensitive to ${\cal C}_{9\mu}-{\cal C}_{9e}$. In fact, if $Q_5$ were found to
be small (i.e. close to its Standard Model value), this would imply a small
${\cal C}_{9\mu}-{\cal C}_{9e}$ but a sizable ${\cal C}_{9}^{\rm U}$, given the
preference of global fits for a large negative new physics contribution in
${\cal C}_{9\mu}$. We discuss the possible origins of ${\cal C}_9^{\rm U}$, in
particular how it could originate from new physics. Here, a promising scenario,
that could even link $b\to s \ell^+\ell^-$ to $R_{D^{(*)}}$, is the one in
which ${\cal C}_9^{\rm U}$ is generated from a tau loop via an off-shell photon
penguin diagram. This setup predicts the branching ratios of
$B_s\to\tau^+\tau^-$ and $B\to K^{(*)}\tau^+\tau^-$ to lie within the reach of

deformations of crystal. The important property of the elasticity vielbein
$E^a_\mu$ is that in general they are not the square mstrices. While the
spacetime index $\mu$ takes the values $\mu=(0,1,2,3)$, in crystals the index
$a=(1,2,3)$, in vortex lattices $a=(1,2)$, and in smectic liquid crystals there
is only one phase field, $a=1$. These phase fields can be considered as the
spin gauge fields, which are similar to the gauge fields in Standard Model (SM)
or in Grand Unification (GUT).
  On the other hand, the rectangular vielbein $e^\mu_a$ may emerge in the
vicinity of Dirac points in Dirac materials. In particular, in the planar phase
of the spin-triplet superfluid $^3$He the spacetime index $\mu=(0,1,2,3)$,
while the spin index $a$ takes values $a=(0,1,2,3,4)$. Although these $(4

effective metric $g^{\mu\nu}$of Dirac quasiparticles remains (3+1)-dimensional.

introducing the rectangular vielbein, where the spin fields belong to the
higher groups, which may include SM or even GUT groups.

the eigenspinor solution of the Dirac equation and then relating it to
incident, reflected, and transmitted beam waves. This relationship allows us to
compute the group delay time in transmission and reflection by obtaining the
corresponding phase shifts. We discovered that the barrier width, incident
energy, and incident angle can all be used to modify the group delay time, and
that the particles travel through the barrier at the Fermi velocity $ v_F $.
Our findings also show that the transmission group delay might be controlled,
and that gate voltage control could be useful in graphene-based tilting

primarily on 2D images. However, due to the advancement of camera technology,
3D point cloud data has become more available than ever, which warrants
considering FSCIL on 3D data. This paper addresses FSCIL in the 3D domain. In
addition to well-known issues of catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge and
overfitting of few-shot data, 3D FSCIL can bring newer challenges. For example,
base classes may contain many synthetic instances in a realistic scenario. In
contrast, only a few real-scanned samples (from RGBD sensors) of novel classes
are available in incremental steps. Due to the data variation from synthetic to
real, FSCIL endures additional challenges, degrading performance in later
incremental steps. We attempt to solve this problem using Microshapes
(orthogonal basis vectors) by describing any 3D objects using a pre-defined set
of rules. It supports incremental training with few-shot examples minimizing
synthetic to real data variation. We propose new test protocols for 3D FSCIL

accumulation, non-adiabatic jumps, and topological mode conversion [1- 8].
Recent theoretical studies, however, have shown that contrary to previously
established demonstrations, this behavior is not strictly a result of winding
around a non-Hermitian degeneracy [9]. Instead, it appears to be mostly
attributed to the non-trivial landscape of the Riemann surfaces, sometimes
because of the presence of an exceptional point in the vicinity [9- 11]. In an
effort to bring this counterintuitive aspect of non-Hermitian systems into
light and confirm this hypothesis, we provide here the first set of experiments
to directly observe the field evolution and chiral state conversion in an
EP-excluding cycle in a slowly varying non- Hermitian system. To do so, a
versatile yet unique fiber-based photonic emulator is realized that utilizes
the polarization degrees of freedom in a quasi-common path single-ring
arrangement. Our observations may open up new avenues for light manipulation

heuristics, relying on the quality of the predictions though without

beyond empirical effectiveness. To address this deficiency, we make use of
conformal prediction, an approach that comes with guarantees on the validity of
set-valued predictions. As a result, the construction of credal sets of labels
is supported by a rigorous theoretical foundation, leading to better calibrated

so-called ``anyonic spin-chain'' and nearest neighbor Hamiltonians providing a
real-time evolution. There is considerable evidence that suitable scaling
limits of such systems can lead to $1+1$-dimensional conformal field theories
(CFTs), and in fact, can be used potentially to construct novel classes of
CFTs. Besides the Hamiltonians and their densities, the spin chain is known to
carry an algebra of symmetry operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, and
these operators have an interesting representation as matrix-product-operators
(MPOs). On the other hand, fusion categories are well-known to arise from a von
Neumann algebra-subfactor pair. In this work, we investigate some interesting
consequences of such structures for the corresponding anyonic spin-chain model.
One of our main results is the construction of a novel algebra of MPOs acting
on a bi-partite anyonic chain. We show that this algebra is precisely
isomorphic to the defect algebra of $1+1$ CFTs as constructed by Fr\"" ohlich et
al. and Bischoff et al., even though the model is defined on a finite lattice.
We thus conjecture that its central projections are associated with the
irreducible vertical (transparent) defects in the scaling limit of the model.
Our results partly rely on the observation that MPOs are closely related to the
so-called ``double triangle algebra'' arising in subfactor theory. In our
subsequent constructions, we use insights into the structure of the double
triangle algebra by B\"" ockenhauer et al. based on the braided structure of the
categories and on $\alpha$-induction. The introductory section of this paper to
subfactors and fusion categories has the character of a review.

of the action of the modular Hamiltonian constrain the possible bulk equation
of motion to be consistent with bulk gauge invariance and diffeomorphism
invariance. In fact we show that requiring that the action of the modular

simple equation of motion, fixes, under reasonable assumptions, both the
equation of motion and the action of the modular Hamiltonian once the first
order $\frac{1}{N}$ terms are known.

require the cooperation and coordination of multiple agents. Learning optimal
policies using reinforcement learning in a multi-agent setting can be very
difficult as the number of agents increases. Recent solutions such as Value
Decomposition Networks (VDN), QMIX, QTRAN and QPLEX adhere to the centralized
training and decentralized execution scheme and perform factorization of the
joint action-value functions. However, these methods still suffer from
increased environmental complexity, and at times fail to converge in a stable
manner. We propose a novel concept of Residual Q-Networks (RQNs) for MARL,
which learns to transform the individual Q-value trajectories in a way that
preserves the Individual-Global-Max criteria (IGM), but is more robust in
factorizing action-value functions. The RQN acts as an auxiliary network that
accelerates convergence and will become obsolete as the agents reach the
training objectives. The performance of the proposed method is compared against
several state-of-the-art techniques such as QPLEX, QMIX, QTRAN and VDN, in a
range of multi-agent cooperative tasks. The results illustrate that the
proposed method, in general, converges faster, with increased stability and
shows robust performance in a wider family of environments. The improvements in
results are more prominent in environments with severe punishments for
non-cooperative behaviours and especially in the absence of complete state
information during training time.

its couplings with the particles that do not form the complete representations

Pantheon, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Redshift-space distortion (RSD)

cosmological parameters well within the allowed range of the observation and
thus gives a well-motivated model of quintessence.

Statistics and Machine Learning. Given a tractable proposal distribution $P$,
from which we can draw exact samples, and a target distribution $Q$ which is
absolutely continuous with respect to $P$, the A* sampling algorithm allows
simulating exact samples from $Q$, provided we can evaluate the Radon-Nikodym
derivative of $Q$ with respect to $P$. Maddison et al. originally showed that
for a target distribution $Q$ and proposal distribution $P$, the runtime of A*
sampling is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\exp(D_{\infty}[Q||P]))$ where
$D_{\infty}[Q||P]$ is the Renyi divergence from $Q$ to $P$. This runtime can be
prohibitively large for many cases of practical interest. Here, we show that
with additional restrictive assumptions on $Q$ and $P$, we can achieve much
faster runtimes. Specifically, we show that if $Q$ and $P$ are distributions on
$\mathbb{R}$ and their Radon-Nikodym derivative is unimodal, the runtime of A*
sampling is $\mathcal{O}(D_{\infty}[Q||P])$, which is exponentially faster than
A* sampling without assumptions.

computers. On near-term hardware the crucial constraint on these simulations is
circuit depth. Many quantum simulation algorithms rely on a layer of unitary
evolutions generated by each term in a Hamiltonian. This appears in
time-dynamics as a single Trotter step, and in variational quantum eigensolvers
under the Hamiltonian variational ansatz as a single ansatz layer. We present a
new quantum algorithm design for materials modelling where the depth of a layer
is independent of the system size. This design takes advantage of the locality
of materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding
that preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and
present a compiler that transforms density functional theory data into quantum
circuit instructions -- connecting the physics of the material to the
simulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple
levels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of
the specific target material. We present numerical results for materials
spanning a wide structural and technological range. Our results demonstrate a
reduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard prior
methods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian. For example our
results improve resource requirements for Strontium Vanadate (SrVO$_3$) from
864 to 180 qubits for a $3\times3\times3$ lattice, and the circuit depth of a
single Trotter or variational layer from $7.5\times 10^8$ to depth $884$.
Although this is still beyond current hardware, our results show that materials
simulation may be feasible on quantum computers without necessarily requiring
scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers, provided quantum algorithm design
incorporates understanding of the materials and applications.

oxygen octahedra could give rise to bond-dependent Kitaev interactions. In this
work, we present and analyze comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering studies
of BCAO with fields in the honeycomb plane. Combining the constraints from the
magnon excitations in the high-field polarized state and the inelastic spin
structure factor measured in zero magnetic field, we examine two leading
theoretical models: the Kitaev-type \JKG model and the \XXZ model. We show that
the existing experimental data can be consistently accounted for by the \XXZ
model but not by the \JKG model, and we discuss the implications of these
results for the realization of a spin liquid phase in BCAO and more generally
for the realization of the Kitaev model in cobaltates.

discriminating new cases compared to trees trained by other decision tree codes

monitoring, publishing etc. However, they are rarely provided by the software
developers and have to be extracted either from the source or from the compiled
code. In the context of Java programs, a number of approaches exist for
building behavioural models. Most of these approaches rely on the analysis of
the compiled bytecode. Instead, we are looking to extract behavioural models in
the form of Finite State Machines (FSMs) from the Java source code to ensure
that the obtained FSMs can be easily understood by the software developers and,
if necessary, updated or integrated into the original source code, e.g. in the
form of annotations. Modern software systems are huge, rely on external
libraries and interact with their environment. Hence, extracting useful
behavioural models requires abstraction. In this paper, we present an initial
approach to this problem by focusing on the extraction of FSMs modelling
library APIs. We focus on the analysis of Java code involving the use of
collections. To this end, we encode the operational semantics of collection
operations using patterns of Boolean predicates. These patterns are
instantiated based on the analysis of the source code of API implementation
methods to form an encoding of the possible FSM transitions. A SAT solver is
then used to determine the enabledness conditions (guards) of these

There are two major limitations in the supervised approaches: a) a model needs
to be retrained from scratch when new train symbols come to adapt to a new
channel status, and b) the length of the training symbols needs to be longer
than a certain threshold to make the model generalize well on unseen symbols.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a meta-learning-based self-supervised
symbol detector named MetaSSD. Our contribution is two-fold: a) meta-learning
helps the model adapt to a new channel environment based on experience with
various meta-training environments, and b) self-supervised learning helps the
model to use relatively less supervision than the previously suggested
learning-based detectors. In experiments, MetaSSD outperforms OFDM-MMSE with
noisy channel information and shows comparable results with BCJR. Further
ablation studies show the necessity of each component in our framework.

systems that can form only in their dense stellar environments. The leap in
sensitivity of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India,
especially at low radio frequencies ($<$ 1 GHz) has motivated a new search for
radio pulsars in a group of eight Southern globular clusters. We discovered PSR
J1835$-$3259B, a 1.83-ms pulsar in NGC 6652; this is in a near-circular wide
orbit of 28.7 hr with a low-mass ($ \sim 0.2 \, M_{\rm \odot}$) companion,
likely a Helium white dwarf. We derived a 10-year timing solution for this
system. We also present measurements of scattering, flux densities and spectral
indices for some of the previously known pulsars in these GCs. A significant
fraction of the pulsars in these clusters have steep spectral indices.
Additionally, we detected eight radio point sources not associated with any
known pulsar positions in the radio images. There are four newly identified
sources, three in NGC 6652 and one in NGC 6539, and one previously identified
source each in NGC 1851, NGC 6440, NGC 6544, and Terzan 5. Surprisingly, our
images show that our newly discovered pulsar, PSR J1835$-$3259B, is the
brightest pulsar in all GCs we have imaged; like other pulsars with broad
profiles (Terzan 5 C and O), its flux density in the radio images is much
larger than in its pulsations. This indicates that their pulsed emission is
only a fraction of their total emission. The detection of radio sources outside
the core radii but well within the tidal radii of these clusters show that
future GC surveys should complement the search analysis by using the imaging
capability of interferometers, and preferentially synthesize large number of
search beams in order to obtain a larger field of view.

We show that relative interlevel set cohomology (RISC), which is based on the

invariant. More specifically, we define an abelian Frobenius category
$\mathrm{pres}(\mathcal{J})$ of presheaves, which are presentable in a certain
sense, such that the RISC $h(f)$ of an $\mathbb{F}$-tame function $f \colon X

moreover the extended persistence diagram of $f$ uniquely determines - and is
determined by - the corresponding element $[h(f)] \in K_0

the sense that sheaf cohomology of any open interval is finite-dimensional in

experience shows that an initial axisymmetric dimple forms around the
indentation point. The ridge of this dimple, with increasing indentation,
eventually buckles into a polygonal shape. The polygon order generally
continues to increase with further indentation. In the case of spherical
shells, both the underlying axisymmetric deformation and the buckling evolution
have been studied in detail. However, little is known about the behaviour of
general geometries. In this work we describe the geometrical and mechanical
features of the axisymmetric ridge that forms in indented general shells of
revolution with non-negative Gaussian curvature and the conditions for
circumferential buckling of this ridge. We show that, under the assumption of
`mirror buckling' a single unified description of this ridge can be written if
the problem is non-dimensionalised using the local slope of the undeformed
shell mid-profile at the ridge radial location. In dimensional form the ridge
properties evolve in quite different ways for different mid-profiles. Focusing
on the indentation of shallow shells of revolution with constant Gaussian
curvature, we use our theoretical framework to study the properties of the
ridge at the circumferential buckling threshold and evaluate the validity of
the mirror buckling assumption against a linear stability analysis on the
shallow shell equations, showing very good agreement. Our results highlight
that circumferential buckling in indented thin shells is controlled by a
complex interplay between the geometry and the stress state in the ridge. The
results of our study will provide greater insight into the mechanics of thin
shells. This could enable indentation to be used to measure the mechanical
properties of a wide range of shell geometries or used to design shells with
specific mechanical behaviours.

is employed for representation learning, which enhances the discriminability of

bypasses the disadvantages of hand-crafted priors and is able to learn

be substantially reduced while maintaining high accuracy. We detail this idea
for tree tensor network states (TTNS) and projected entangled-pair states.
Simulations of spin models on Cayley trees with low-rank TTNS exemplify the
effect of rank constraints on the expressive power. We find that choosing the
tensor rank $r$ to be on the order of the bond dimension $m$, is sufficient to
obtain high-accuracy groundstate approximations and to substantially outperform
standard TTNS computations. Thus low-rank tensor networks are a promising route

non-compositionality of idioms is reflected in the mechanics of the dominant

for models with English as source language and one of seven European languages

identifies the expression as idiomatic - the encoder processes idioms more
strongly as single lexical units compared to literal expressions. This
manifests in idioms' parts being grouped through attention and in reduced

figurative inputs result in reduced attention on source-side tokens. These
results suggest that Transformer's tendency to process idioms as compositional
expressions contributes to literal translations of idioms.

Rydberg blockade mechanism. Here we unify these varied approaches in a single
parent Hamiltonian, in which local fluctuations of anyons stabilize
deconfinement. The parent Hamiltonian is defined on kagom\'e triangles -- each
hosting four RVB-like states -- and includes only Ising interactions and
single-site transverse fields. In the weak-field limit, the ruby spin liquid

This paper addresses two major shortcomings of previous work in this area: the
lack of rigour in the derivation of the EM training algorithm; and the
computational complexity of the technique, which has limited it to low
dimensional data sets. We first present a detailed derivation of EM for the
Gaussian shared kernel model PRBF classifier, making use of data association
theory to obtain the complete data likelihood, Baum's auxiliary function (the
E-step) and its subsequent maximisation (M-step). To reduce complexity of the
resulting SKEM algorithm, we partition the feature space into $R$
non-overlapping subsets of variables. The resulting product decomposition of
the joint data likelihood, which is exact when the feature partitions are
independent, allows the SKEM to be implemented in parallel and at $R^2$ times
lower complexity. The operation of the partitioned SKEM algorithm is
demonstrated on the MNIST data set and compared with its non-partitioned

that a compelling trade-off between performance and efficiency can be achieved

For instance, dynamic sparse training (DST), is capable of reaching a
competitive performance of dense training by iteratively evolving the sparse
topology during the course of training. In this paper, we argue that it is
better to allocate the limited resources to create multiple low-loss sparse
subnetworks and superpose them into a stronger one, instead of allocating all
resources entirely to find an individual subnetwork. To achieve this, two
desiderata are required: (1) efficiently producing many low-loss subnetworks,
the so-called cheap tickets, within one training process limited to the
standard training time used in dense training; (2) effectively superposing
these cheap tickets into one stronger subnetwork. To corroborate our
conjecture, we present a novel sparse training approach, termed Sup-tickets,

new neutral scalar with mass not too far above the electro-weak scale, as well
as vector-like quarks at the (multi-)TeV scale. Both are consistent with
current bounds and are attractive for future experimental searches at the LHC
and future colliders. Depending on the hypercharge of the vector-like quarks,
hadrons made of them are color-neutral bound states which would be interesting

representative sample of galaxies (~1000 galaxies with Mstar > 10^8 Msun at
z=0) at a resolution (~20 pc, m_b ~ 6x10^4 Msun) comparable to state-of-the-art
galaxy zoom-in simulations. FIREbox captures the multiphase nature of the
interstellar medium in a fully cosmological setting (L=22.1 Mpc) thanks to its
exceptionally high dynamic range (~10^6) and the inclusion of multi-channel
stellar feedback. Here, we focus on validating the simulation predictions by
comparing to observational data. We find that simulated galaxies with Mstar <
10^{10.5-11} Msun have star formation rates, gas masses, and metallicities in
broad agreement with observations. These galaxy scaling relations extend to low
masses (Mstar ~ 10^7 Msun) and follow a (broken) power-law relationship. Also
reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column density
distribution at z~0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the
stellar-mass--halo-mass relation, but also a higher abundance of massive
galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate density than observed, showing
that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties of
massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size,
FIREbox offers a baseline prediction of galaxy formation theory in a
$\Lambda$CDM Universe while also highlighting modeling challenges to be
addressed in next-generation galaxy simulations.

symmetries can be understood in terms of the properties of solitonic defects,
which generically are non-topological defects. The defining property of such
defects is that they act as sources for background fields of generalized
symmetries. 't Hooft anomalies arise when solitonic defects are charged under
these generalized symmetries. We illustrate this idea for several kinds of
anomalies in various spacetime dimensions. A systematic exploration is
performed in 3d for 0-form, 1-form, and 2-group symmetries, whose 't Hooft
anomalies are related to two special types of solitonic defects, namely vortex
line defects and monopole operators. This analysis is supplemented with
detailed computations of such anomalies in a large class of 3d gauge theories.
Central to this computation is the determination of the gauge and 0-form
charges of a variety of monopole operators: these involve standard gauge
monopole operators, but also fractional gauge monopole operators, as well as
monopole operators for 0-form symmetries. The charges of these monopole
operators mainly receive contributions from Chern-Simons terms and fermions in
the matter content. Along the way, we interpret the vanishing of the global
gauge and ABJ anomalies, which are anomalies not captured by local anomaly
polynomials, as the requirement that gauge monopole operators and mixed
monopole operators for 0-form and gauge symmetries have non-fractional integer
charges.

spacetimes, such as those containing a big bang, with regular metrics, yet they
can also describe unphysical solutions in which quantum transitions may be more
probable than ordinary classical evolution. In the cosmological context, we
investigate a criterion proposed by Witten (based on works of Kontsevich &
Segal and of Louko & Sorkin) to decide whether a complex metric is allowable or
not. Because of the freedom to deform complex metrics using Cauchy's theorem,
deciding whether a metric is allowable in general requires solving a
complicated optimisation problem. We describe a method that allows one to
quickly determine the allowability of minisuperspace metrics. This enables us
to study the off-shell structure of minisuperspace path integrals, which we
investigate for various boundary conditions. Classical transitions always
reside on the boundary of the domain of allowable metrics, and care must be
taken in defining appropriate integration contours for the corresponding
gravitational path integral. Perhaps more surprisingly, we find that proposed
quantum (`tunnelling') transitions from a contracting to an expanding universe
violate the allowability criterion and may thus be unphysical. No-boundary
solutions, by contrast, are found to be allowable, and moreover we demonstrate
that with an initial momentum condition an integration contour over allowable

known to establish entanglement, which if detected would witness the quantum

unable to create entanglement. Here, we show in paradigmatic cases that,
despite the absence of entanglement, a classical-channel model of gravity can
still establish quantum correlations in the form of quantum discord between two
masses. This is demonstrated for the Kafri-Taylor-Milburn (KTM) model and a
recently proposed dissipative extension of this. In both cases, starting from
an uncorrelated state, a significant amount of discord is generally created.
This eventually decays in the KTM model, while it converges to a small
stationary value in its dissipative extension. We also find that initial local
squeezing on the state of the masses can significanlty enhance the generated

stacking their HI 21 cm emission signals. We divide our sample of 11,419

which dominate the decline in the cosmic SFR density at $z\lesssim1$, have HI
reservoirs that can sustain their SFRs for only a short period, $0.86\pm0.20$

shear velocity dependence of TMLs, we perform a set of 3D hydrodynamic
simulations with an emphasis on the TML properties at high Mach numbers
$\mathcal{M}$. Since the shear velocity in mixing regions is limited by the
local sound speed of mixed gas, high-Mach number TMLs develop into a two-zone
structure: a Mach number-independent mixing zone traced by significant cooling
and mixing, plus a turbulent zone with large velocity dispersions which expands
with greater $\mathcal{M}$. Low-Mach number TMLs do not have distinguishable
mixing and turbulent zones. The radiative cooling of TMLs at low and high Mach
numbers is predominantly balanced by enthalpy consumption and turbulent
dissipation respectively. Both the TML surface brightness and column densities
of intermediate-temperature ions (e.g., O VI) scale as
$\propto\mathcal{M}^{0.5}$ at $\mathcal{M} \lesssim 1$, but reach saturation
($\propto \mathcal{M}^0$) at $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 1$. Inflow velocities and hot
gas entrainment into TMLs are substantially suppressed at high Mach numbers,
and strong turbulent dissipation drives the evaporation of cold gas. This is in
contrast to low-Mach number TMLs where the inflow velocities and hot gas
entrainment are enhanced with greater $\mathcal{M}$, and cold gas mass
increases due to the condensation of entrained hot gas.

abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the solar mass range. This
constraint, however, inherently relies on the merger rate predicted by PBH
models. Previous analyses have focused mainly on two binary formation
mechanisms: early Universe assembly out of decoupling from the Hubble expansion
and dynamical capture in present-day dark matter structures. Using reaction
rates of three-body processes studied in the astrophysical context, we show
that, under conservative assumptions, three-body interactions in PBH halos
efficiently produce binaries. Those binaries form at high redshift in
Poisson-induced PBH small-scale structures and a fraction is predicted to
coalesce and merge within the current age of the Universe, at odds with the
dynamical capture scenario where they merge promptly. In general, we find that
this channel predicts rates comparable to the dynamical capture scenario.
However, binaries formed from three-body interactions do not significantly
contribute to the overall PBH merger rate unless PBHs made up a dominant
fraction of the dark matter above the solar mass range, a scenario that is
ruled out by current constraints. Our results support strong bounds on the PBH
abundance in the stellar mass range derived from Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory/Virgo/KAGRA observations. Finally, we show that
both dynamical channels are always subdominant compared to early Universe
assembly for PBH mergers in the asteroid mass range, while we expect it to
become relevant in scenarios where PBHs are initially strongly clustered.

types of quasicrystals described by coexisting phason flips and discuss their
quantum transports with distinct local tiling patterns. It turns out that such
new tilings are uniquely descended from the translation of high-dimensional
lattices and their projection, in particular, a four-dimensional hypercubic
lattice. Such unconventional tiling gives rise to sub-dimensionally confined
states forming a bridge, so-called quantum bridge states. It turns out that
electrons in such states could be strongly localized by applying a magnetic
field at a particular time but are transported to the sites which share the
same local patterns along the bridge with time evolution. The speed of
transport is controlled via magnetic field strength, and one can even expect
electron transportation between multiple bridges where their numbers are
determined by the translation vectors of a four-dimensional hypercubic lattice.

such as autonomous driving and text identification. In order to mitigate these
risks, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying adversarial

conspirator responsible for a neural network's incorrect prediction, in
contrast to the widely held belief that human-unidentifiable characteristics
play a critical role in fooling a network. This concept of human-recognizable
characteristics enables us to explain key features of adversarial

holds great promise for enhancing metrology and communications. Much of the
focus of quantum metrology to date has been on generating highly entangled
quantum states which offer better sensitivity, per resource, than can be
achieved classically [1-3]. However, to reach the ultimate limits in
multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks,
collective measurements, which generate entanglement between multiple copies of
the quantum state, are necessary [4-6]. There is presently no known method for
implementing arbitrary, optimal collective measurements on more than two copies
of the quantum state. Here we experimentally demonstrate theoretically optimal
single-copy (separable) and two-copy (entangled) collective measurements for
simultaneously estimating two non-commuting qubit rotations. This allows us to
draw fundamental insights about the interpretation of the uncertainty
principle. We implement our optimal measurements on superconducting,
trapped-ion and photonic systems, providing an indication of how future
quantum-enhanced sensing networks may look. This work offers a pathway to
extracting the maximal advantage of quantum mechanics for information
processing tasks [7, 8].

increasingly prevalent in cloud computing, forming the basis for confidential

be read by the hypervisor, OS, or other software on the platform. Whilst some
newer TEE architectures support migration of entire protected VMs, there is
currently no practical solution for migrating individual processes containing
in-process TEEs. The inability to migrate such processes leads to operational
inefficiencies or even data loss if the host platform must be urgently
restarted.
  We present CTR, a software-only design to retrofit migration functionality
into existing TEE architectures, whilst maintaining their expected security
guarantees. Our design allows TEEs to be interrupted and migrated at arbitrary
points in their execution, thus maintaining compatibility with existing VM and
process migration techniques. By cooperatively involving the TEE in the
migration process, our design also allows application developers to specify
stateful migration-related policies, such as limiting the number of times a
particular TEE may be migrated. Our prototype implementation for Intel SGX
demonstrates that migration latency increases linearly with the size of the TEE
memory and is dominated by TEE system operations.

sending many particles. In this work, we consider sending -- in parallel,

design by serving as a co-equal partner to costly and challenging ground and
flight testing. However, the fundamental assumptions that make turbulence
modeling such an appealing alternative to its scale-resolved counterparts also
degrade its accuracy for practical high-speed configurations, especially when
fully 3D flows are considered. The current investigation develops a methodology
to improve the performance of turbulence modeling for a complex Mach 8.3, 3D
shock boundary layer interaction (SBLI) in a double fin geometry. A
representative two-equation model, with low-Reynolds number terms, is used as a
test-bed. Deficiencies in the baseline model are first elucidated using
benchmark test cases involving a Mach~11.1 zero pressure gradient boundary
layer and a Mach~6.17 flow over an axisymmetric compression corner. From among
different possibilities, two coefficients are introduced to inhibit the
non-physical over-amplification of (i) turbulence production and (ii)
turbulence length-scale downstream of a shock wave. The coefficients rely on
terms already present in the original model, which simplifies implementation
and maintains computational costs. The values of the coefficients are
predicated on the distribution of turbulence quantities upstream of the shock;
this ensures that the modifications do not degrade the model predictions in
simpler situations such as attached boundary layers, where they are
unnecessary. The effects of the modifications are shown to result in
significant improvements in surface pressure and wall heat flux for the 3D SBLI
test case, which contains numerous features not observed in 2D situations, such
as 3D separation, skewed boundary layers and centerline vortices.

quadratic model for our purposes. We state conditions on the system model under
which it is possible to establish a monotonic policy improvement guarantee,
propose a surrogate function for policy gradient estimation, and show that it
is possible to compute exact advantage estimates if both the state transition
model and the policy are deterministic. Finally, we describe two novel robotic
control environments -- one with non-local rewards in the frequency domain and
the other with a long horizon (8000 time-steps) -- for which our policy
gradient method (TDPO) significantly outperforms existing methods (PPO, TRPO,
DDPG, and TD3). Our implementation with all the experimental settings is

connected by quantum channels, just like conventional computers are wired up to

and non-local correlations available in a quantum-controlled system facilitate
novel fundamental tests of quantum theory. In addition, they enable numerous
applications in distributed quantum information processing, quantum
communication, and precision measurement.
  While pioneering experiments have demonstrated the entanglement of two
quantum nodes separated by up to 1.3 km, and three nodes in the same
laboratory, accessing the full potential of quantum networks requires scaling
of these prototypes to many more nodes and global distances. This is an
outstanding challenge, posing high demands on qubit control fidelity, qubit
coherence time, and coupling efficiency between stationary and flying qubits.
  In this work, I will describe how optical resonators facilitate quantum
network nodes that achieve the above-mentioned prerequisites in different
physical systems -- trapped atoms, defect centers in wide-bandgap
semiconductors, and rare-earth dopants -- by enabling high-fidelity qubit
initialization and readout, efficient generation of qubit-photon and remote

2.5{\mu}m (PM2.5) has been identified as one critical cause for respiratory
disease. Disparities in exposure to PM2.5 among income groups at individual
residences are known to exist and are easy to calculate. Existing approaches
for exposure assessment, however, do not capture the exposure implied by the
dynamic mobility of city dwellers that accounts for a large proportion of the
exposure outside homes. To overcome the challenge of gauging the exposure to
PM2.5 for city dwellers, we analyzed billions of anonymized and
privacy-enhanced location-based data generated by mobile phone users in Harris
County, Texas, to characterize the mobility patterns of the populations and
associated exposure. We introduce the metric for exposure extent based on the
time people spent at places with the air pollutant and examine the disparities
in mobility-based exposure across income groups. Our results show that PM2.5
emissions disproportionately expose low-income populations due to their
mobility activities. People with higher-than-average income are exposed to
lower levels of PM2.5 emissions. These disparities in mobility-based exposure
are the result of frequent visits of low-income people to the industrial
sectors of urban areas with high PM2.5 emissions, and the larger mobility scale
of these people for life needs. The results inform about environmental justice
and public health strategies, not only to reduce the overall PM2.5 exposure but
also to mitigate the disproportional impacts on low-income populations. The
findings also suggest that an integration of extensive fine-scale population
mobility and pollution emissions data can unveil new insights into inequality
in air pollution exposures at the urban scale.

unsupervised learning of spatiotemporal dictionaries composed of convolutional

accumulator neurons, which combine a conventional leaky-integrate-and-fire

minimize the difference between the integrated input and the spiking output. We
demonstrate dictionary learning across a wide range of dynamical regimes, from
graded to intermittent spiking, for inferring sparse representations of both
static images drawn from the CIFAR database as well as video frames captured
from a DVS camera. On a classification task that requires identification of the
suite from a deck of cards being rapidly flipped through as viewed by a DVS

to infer sparse spatiotemporal representations migrates from graded to spiking.
We conclude that accumulator neurons are likely to provide a powerful enabling

identify 31 $z\gtrsim8$ candidates via colour selection and photo-$z$ analysis
with observed magnitude ($24.1< H_{160} <26.6$). Following detailed
completeness and source recovery simulations in each independent field, as well
as modelling of interloper contamination, we derive rest-frame UV luminosity
functions at $z=8-10$ down to UV magnitude $\simeq-23$. We find that the
bright-end of the galaxy luminosity function can be described both by a
Schechter and by a double power-law function, with our space-based large area
determination showing some tentative discrepancies with the luminosity
functions derived from ground-based observations at the same redshifts.
Interestingly, the UV luminosity function we derived at $z=8$ is consistent
with no evolution of the bright end from $z=6-7$, suggesting a substantial
contribution from AGNs at magnitude $M_{UV}<-22$. On the other hand, our
derived UVLFs at all redshifts are still consistent with a scenario where the
UV light originates from stars, but there is a vanishing dust content at

understand galaxy formation in extreme objects during the epoch of reionization

irradiated in T25 cm$^2$ flasks using 220 kV X-rays with an open field or
through a tungsten GRID collimator with periodical 5 mm openings and 10 mm

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were employed to map the dose distribution in the
flasks at each surviving colony centroid. Fitting the linear-quadratic (LQ)
function to clonogenic survival data for open field irradiation, the expected
survival level at a given dose level was calculated. The expected survival
level was then mapped together with the observed levels in the GRID-irradiated
flasks. GFD and FLUKA MC gave similar dose distributions, with a mean
peak-to-valley dose ratio of about 5. LQ-parameters for open field irradiation
gave $\alpha = 0.16 \pm 0.04$ Gy$^{-1}$ and $\beta = 0.001 \pm 0.004$
Gy$^{-2}$. Using the image segmentation method, the mean absolute percentage
deviation between observed and predicted survival in the (peak; valley) dose
regions was (8; 10) %, (4; 41) %, and (3; 138) % for 2, 5 and 10 Gy,

members of groups that are marginalized due to gender, ethnicity, or other

acquisition of seismic data, in recent decades considerable effort has been put
into so-called simultaneous shooting acquisitions, where seismic sources are
fired at short time intervals between each other. As a consequence, waves
originating from consecutive shots are entangled within the seismic recordings,
yielding so-called blended data. For processing and imaging purposes, the data
generated by each individual shot must be retrieved. This process, called
deblending, is achieved by solving an inverse problem which is heavily
underdetermined. Conventional approaches rely on transformations that render
the blending noise into burst-like noise, whilst preserving the signal of
interest. Compressed sensing type regularization is then applied, where
sparsity in some domain is assumed for the signal of interest. The domain of
choice depends on the geometry of the acquisition and the properties of seismic
data within the chosen domain. In this work, we introduce a new concept that
consists of embedding a self-supervised denoising network into the
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework. A novel network is introduced whose design
extends the blind-spot network architecture of [28 ] for partially coherent
noise (i.e., correlated in time). The network is then trained directly on the
noisy input data at each step of the PnP algorithm. By leveraging both the
underlying physics of the problem and the great denoising capabilities of our
blind-spot network, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform an
industry-standard method whilst being comparable in terms of computational
cost. Moreover, being independent on the acquisition geometry, our method can
be easily applied to both marine and land data without any significant
modification.

demonstrations, given access to the environment or an accurate simulator. Prior
work has shown that in the infinite sample regime, exact moment matching
achieves value equivalence to the expert policy. However, in the finite sample
regime, even if one has no optimization error, empirical variance can lead to a
performance gap that scales with $H^2 / N$ for behavioral cloning and $H /
\sqrt{N}$ for online moment matching, where $H$ is the horizon and $N$ is the
size of the expert dataset. We introduce the technique of replay estimation to
reduce this empirical variance: by repeatedly executing cached expert actions
in a stochastic simulator, we compute a smoother expert visitation distribution
estimate to match. In the presence of general function approximation, we prove
a meta theorem reducing the performance gap of our approach to the parameter

In the tabular setting or with linear function approximation, our meta theorem
shows that the performance gap incurred by our approach achieves the optimal

digital world. People can socialize, play games and even shop with their
avatars created in this virtual environment. Metaverse, which is growing very
fast in terms of investment, is both a profitable and risky area for consumers.
In order to enter the Metaverse for investment purposes, it is necessary to do
a certain research and gather information. In this direction, the aim of the
study is to determine the effect of the quality of the information obtained by
the consumers about the metaverse world, the reliability of the information and
the perceived risk, on the purchase intention from the point of view of the
information adoption model. For the research, data were collected online from
495 consumers who were interested in metaverse investment. AMOS and SPSS
package programs were used in the analysis. First, descriptive statistical
analyzes were made for the basic structure of the variables. Then the
reliability and validity of the model were tested. Finally, the structural
equation model was used to test the proposed model. According to the findings,
the reliability and quality of the information affect the purchase intention
positively and significantly, while the perceived risk affects the purchase
intention negatively and significantly.

stop-feedback (VLSF) code constrained to have $m$ decoding times, with an
ACK/NACK feedback to the transmitter at each decoding time. This paper focuses
on the numerical evaluation of the maximal achievable rate of random VLSF codes
as a function of $m$ for the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise
channel, binary symmetric channel, and binary erasure channel (BEC). Leveraging
Edgeworth and Petrov expansions, we develop tight approximations to the tail
probability of length-$n$ cumulative information density that are accurate for
any blocklength $n$. We reduce Yavas et al.'s non-asymptotic achievability
bound on VLSF codes with $m$ decoding times to an integer program of minimizing
the upper bound on the average blocklength subject to the average error
probability, minimum gap, and integer constraints. We develop two distinct
methods to solve this program. Numerical evaluations show that Polyanskiy's
achievability bound for VLSF codes, which assumes $m = \infty$, can be
approached with a small $m$ for all three channels. For BEC, we consider
systematic transmission followed by random linear fountain coding. This allows
us to obtain a new achievability bound stronger than a previous bound and new
VLSF codes whose rate further outperforms Polyanskiy's bound.

  Learning and Decision Making (RLDM2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To convey desired behavior to a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, a designer
must choose a reward function for the environment, arguably the most important
knob designers have in interacting with RL agents. Although many reward
functions induce the same optimal behavior (Ng et al., 1999), in practice, some
of them result in faster learning than others. In this paper, we look at how
reward-design choices impact learning speed and seek to identify principles of
good reward design that quickly induce target behavior. This
reward-identification problem is framed as an optimization problem: Firstly, we
advocate choosing state-based rewards that maximize the action gap, making
optimal actions easy to distinguish from suboptimal ones. Secondly, we propose
minimizing a measure of the horizon, something we call the ""subjective
discount"", over which rewards need to be optimized to encourage agents to make
optimal decisions with less lookahead. To solve this optimization problem, we
propose a linear-programming based algorithm that efficiently finds a reward
function that maximizes action gap and minimizes subjective discount. We test
the rewards generated with the algorithm in tabular environments with
Q-Learning, and empirically show they lead to faster learning. Although we only
focus on Q-Learning because it is perhaps the simplest and most well understood
RL algorithm, preliminary results with R-max (Brafman and Tennenholtz, 2000)
suggest our results are much more general. Our experiments support three
principles of reward design: 1) consistent with existing results, penalizing
each step taken induces faster learning than rewarding the goal. 2) When
rewarding subgoals along the target trajectory, rewards should gradually
increase as the goal gets closer. 3) Dense reward that's nonzero on every state
is only good if designed carefully.

cellular automaton (CA) over $A^G$ is a function $\tau : A^G \to A^G$ defined
via a finite memory set $S \subseteq G$ and a local function $\mu :A^S \to A$.
The goal of this paper is to introduce the definition of a generalized cellular
automaton (GCA) $\tau : A^G \to A^H$, where $H$ is another arbitrary group, via
a group homomorphism $\phi : H \to G$. Our definition preserves the essence of
CA, as we prove analogous versions of three key results in the theory of CA: a
generalized Curtis-Hedlund Theorem for GCA, a Theorem of Composition for GCA,
and a Theorem of Invertibility for GCA. When $G=H$, we prove that the group of
invertible GCA over $A^G$ is isomorphic to a semidirect product of
$\text{Aut}(G)^{op}$ and the group of invertible CA. Finally, we apply our
results to study automorphisms of the monoid $\text{CA}(G;A)$ consisting of all
CA over $A^G$. In particular, we show that every $\phi \in \text{Aut}(G)$
defines an automorphism of $\text{CA}(G;A)$ via conjugation by the invertible
GCA defined by $\phi$, and that, when $G$ is abelian, $\text{Aut}(G)$ is
embedded in the outer automorphism group of $\text{CA}(G;A)$.

complex task and faces challenges such as unknowness, heterogeneity, and class
imbalance. Anomaly detection using deep learning is therefore mainly
constrained to generative models such as generative adversarial networks and

escalating complexity of processes we wish to monitor spurs the need for more
flexible control charts such as those used in profile monitoring. Additionally,
designing a control chart that has an acceptable false alarm rate for a
practitioner is a common challenge. Alarm fatigue can occur if the sampling
rate is high (say, once a millisecond) and the control chart is calibrated to
an average in-control run length ($ARL_0$) of 200 or 370 which is often done in
the literature. As alarm fatigue may not just be annoyance but result in
detrimental effects to the quality of the product, control chart designers
should seek to minimize the false alarm rate. Unfortunately, reducing the false
alarm rate typically comes at the cost of detection delay or average
out-of-control run length ($ARL_1$). Motivated by recent work on eigenvector
perturbation theory, we develop a computationally fast control chart called the
Eigenvector Perturbation Control Chart for nonparametric profile monitoring.
The control chart monitors the $l_2$ perturbation of the leading eigenvector of
a correlation matrix and requires only a sample of known in-control profiles to
determine control limits. Through a simulation study we demonstrate that it is
able to outperform its competition by achieving an $ARL_1$ close to or equal to
1 even when the control limits result in a large $ARL_0$ on the order of
$10^6$. Additionally, non-zero false alarm rates with a change point after
$10^4$ in-control observations were only observed in scenarios that are either
pathological or truly difficult for a correlation based monitoring scheme.

the degree of enhancement of the stream's flux due to gravitational focusing.
In this paper, we present measurements of the radiant dispersion of twelve

take into account the risks posed by the actions of other agents. However, the
dominant paradigm in game theory (GT) assumes that agents are not affected by
risk from other agents and only strive to maximise their expected utility. For
example, in hybrid human-AI driving systems, it is necessary to limit large
deviations in reward resulting from car crashes. Although there are equilibrium
concepts in game theory that take into account risk aversion, they either
assume that agents are risk-neutral with respect to the uncertainty caused by
the actions of other agents, or they are not guaranteed to exist. We introduce
a new GT-based Risk-Averse Equilibrium (RAE) that always produces a solution
that minimises the potential variance in reward accounting for the strategy of
other agents. Theoretically and empirically, we show RAE shares many properties
with a Nash Equilibrium (NE), establishing convergence properties and
generalising to risk-dominant NE in certain cases. To tackle large-scale
problems, we extend RAE to the PSRO multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
framework. We empirically demonstrate the minimum reward variance benefits of
RAE in matrix games with high-risk outcomes. Results on MARL experiments show
RAE generalises to risk-dominant NE in a trust dilemma game and that it reduces
instances of crashing by 7x in an autonomous driving setting versus the best
performing baseline.

the items in this two-stage architecture. In particular, we find that existing
first-stage recommenders might select an irrecoverably unfair set of candidates

quantification, we propose two threshold-policy selection rules that can
provide distribution-free and finite-sample guarantees on fairness in
first-stage recommenders. More concretely, given any relevance model of queries
and items and a point-wise lower confidence bound on the expected number of
relevant items for each threshold-policy, the two rules find near-optimal sets
of candidates that contain enough relevant items in expectation from each group
of items. To instantiate the rules, we demonstrate how to derive such
confidence bounds from potentially partial and biased user feedback data, which
are abundant in many large-scale recommender systems. In addition, we provide
both finite-sample and asymptotic analyses of how close the two threshold

mixed-precision schemes rely on having a high exploration space, resulting in a
large carbon footprint. In addition, these bit allocation strategies mostly
induce constraints on the model size rather than utilizing the performance of
neural network deployment on specific hardware. Our work proposes Fast-Bit
Allocation for Mixed-Precision Quantization (FBM), which finds an optimal
bitwidth allocation by measuring desired behaviors through a simulation of a
specific device, or even on a physical one.
  While dynamic transitions of bit allocation in mixed precision quantization
with ultra-low bitwidth are known to suffer from performance degradation, we
present a fast recovery solution from such transitions.
  A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
demonstrates our method's superiority over current state-of-the-art schemes in
terms of the trade-off between neural network accuracy and hardware efficiency.

evidence with this level of significance for the existence of the odderon. If
combined with evidence obtained through different experiment-theory

reconstruction tasks such as 2D human pose estimation (2D HPE), 3D human pose
estimation (3D HPE), and human mesh reconstruction (HMR) tasks. In these tasks,
feature map representations of the human structural information are often
extracted first from the image by a CNN (such as HRNet), and then further
processed by transformer to predict the heatmaps (encodes each joint's location
into a feature map with a Gaussian distribution) for HPE or HMR. However,
existing transformer architectures are not able to process these feature map
inputs directly, forcing an unnatural flattening of the location-sensitive
human structural information. Furthermore, much of the performance benefit in
recent HPE and HMR methods has come at the cost of ever-increasing computation
and memory needs. Therefore, to simultaneously address these problems, we
propose FeatER, a novel transformer design that preserves the inherent
structure of feature map representations when modeling attention while reducing
memory and computational costs. Taking advantage of FeatER, we build an
efficient network for a set of human reconstruction tasks including 2D HPE, 3D
HPE, and HMR. A feature map reconstruction module is applied to improve the
performance of the estimated human pose and mesh. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FeatER on various human pose and mesh

method as they are about the data. Here, we develop a new class of methods that
provides consistent estimation of the combined uncertainty arising from both
the finite number of data observed and the finite amount of computation
expended. The most common GP approximations map to an instance in this class,
such as methods based on the Cholesky factorization, conjugate gradients, and
inducing points. For any method in this class, we prove (i) convergence of its
posterior mean in the associated RKHS, (ii) decomposability of its combined
posterior covariance into mathematical and computational covariances, and (iii)
that the combined variance is a tight worst-case bound for the squared error

managers have to balance short-term risk (no items to sell) with long-term-risk

especially hard due to the lack of information about future customer purchases.
In this paper, we study the problem of restocking a grocery store's inventory
with perishable items over time, from a distributional point of view. The
objective is to maximize sales while minimizing waste, with uncertainty about
the actual consumption by costumers. This problem is of a high relevance today,
given the growing demand for food and the impact of food waste on the
environment, the economy, and purchasing power. We frame inventory restocking
as a new reinforcement learning task that exhibits stochastic behavior
conditioned on the agent's actions, making the environment partially
observable. We make two main contributions. First, we introduce a new
reinforcement learning environment, RetaiL, based on real grocery store data
and expert knowledge. This environment is highly stochastic, and presents a
unique challenge for reinforcement learning practitioners. We show that
uncertainty about the future behavior of the environment is not handled well by
classical supply chain algorithms, and that distributional approaches are a
good way to account for the uncertainty. Second, we introduce GTDQN, a
distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a generalized Tukey
Lambda distribution over the reward space. GTDQN provides a strong baseline for
our environment. It outperforms other distributional reinforcement learning
approaches in this partially observable setting, in both overall reward and

coordinates $(x,y,z) \in R^3$ to scalar intensity $I(x,y,z) \in R^1$,
generalizing the well-known charge conjugation and parity symmetry
(CP-symmetry) applying to elementary charged particles. Feature orientation is
modeled as a set of discrete states corresponding to potential axis
reflections, independently of image contrast inversion. Two primary axis
vectors are derived from image observations and potentially subject to
reflection, and a third axis is an axial vector defined by the right-hand rule.
Augmenting local feature properties with sign in addition to standard
(location, scale, orientation) geometry leads to descriptors that are invariant
to coordinate reflections and intensity contrast inversion. Feature properties
are factored in to probabilistic point-based registration as symmetric kernels,
based on a model of binary feature correspondence. Experiments using the
well-known coherent point drift (CPD) algorithm demonstrate that SIFT-CPD
kernels achieve the most accurate and rapid registration of the human brain and
CT chest, including multiple MRI modalities of differing intensity contrast,
and abnormal local variations such as tumors or occlusions. SIFT-CPD image
registration is invariant to global scaling, rotation and translation and image
intensity inversions of the input data.

development of task-specific machine learning methods, understanding the

and prior knowledge of the domain scientist with rewards that define
experimental goals and machine learning algorithms that can translate these to
specific experimental protocols. Here, we discuss the basic principles of
Bayesian active learning and illustrate its applications for SPM. We progress
from the Gaussian Process as a simple data-driven method and Bayesian inference
for physical models as an extension of physics-based functional fits to more
complex deep kernel learning methods, structured Gaussian Processes, and
hypothesis learning. These frameworks allow for the use of prior data, the
discovery of specific functionalities as encoded in spectral data, and
exploration of physical laws manifesting during the experiment. The discussed
framework can be universally applied to all techniques combining imaging and
spectroscopy, SPM methods, nanoindentation, electron microscopy and

a finite periodic spatial domain. Based on a kinematic model simulating the
generation of active wave modes in a finite discrete wavenumber space
$\mathcal{S}_R$, we examine the possibility of direct and inverse energy
cascades. More specifically, we set an initially excited region which
iteratively spreads energy to wave modes in $\mathcal{S}_R$ through exact
resonances. At each iteration, we first activate new modes from scale
resonances (which generate modes with new lengths), then consider two bounding
situations for angle resonances (which transfer energy at the same length
scale): the lower bound where no angle resonance is included and the upper
bound where all modes with the same length as any active mode are excited. Such
a strategy is essential to enable the computation for a large domain
$\mathcal{S}_R$ with the maximum wavenumber $R\sim 10^3$. We show that for both
direct and inverse cascades, the energy cascade to the boundaries of
$\mathcal{S}_R$ can be established when the initially excited region is
sufficiently large, otherwise a frozen turbulence state occurs, with a sharp
transition between the two regimes especially for the direct cascade. Through a
study on the structure of resonant quartets, the mechanism associated with the
sharp transition and the role of angular energy transfer in the cascades are
elucidated.

knockoffs procedure is in essence an e-BH procedure. We make use of this
connection, and derandomize model-X knockoffs by aggregating the e-values
resulting from multiple knockoff realizations. We prove that the derandomized
procedure controls the FDR at the desired level, without any additional
conditions (in contrast, previously proposed methods for derandomization are
not able to guarantee FDR control). The proposed method is evaluated with
numerical experiments, where we find that the derandomized procedure achieves
comparable power and dramatically decreased selection variability when compared

Particularly, we find that the inherent randomness of the widely used
stochastic gradient descent can cause existing data value notions (e.g., the
Shapley value and the Leave-one-out error) to produce inconsistent data value
rankings across different runs. To address this challenge, we introduce the
concept of safety margin, which measures the robustness of a data value notion.
We show that the Banzhaf value, a famous value notion that originated from
cooperative game theory literature, achieves the largest safety margin among
all semivalues (a class of value notions that satisfy crucial properties
entailed by ML applications and include the famous Shapley value and
Leave-one-out error). We propose an algorithm to efficiently estimate the
Banzhaf value based on the Maximum Sample Reuse (MSR) principle. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the Banzhaf value outperforms the existing semivalue-based
data value notions on several ML tasks such as learning with weighted samples
and noisy label detection. Overall, our study suggests that when the underlying
ML algorithm is stochastic, the Banzhaf value is a promising alternative to the
other semivalue-based data value schemes given its computational advantage and
ability to robustly differentiate data quality.

history of science and technology. As the number of scientific papers continues
to increase exponentially, there is a growing opportunity for finding diverse
solutions to existing problems. However, realizing this potential requires the
development of a means for searching through a large corpus that goes beyond
surface matches and simple keywords. Here we contribute the first end-to-end
system for analogical search on scientific papers and evaluate its
effectiveness with scientists' own problems. Using a human-in-the-loop AI
system as a probe we find that our system facilitates creative ideation, and
that ideation success is mediated by an intermediate level of matching on the
problem abstraction (i.e., high versus low). We also demonstrate a fully
automated AI search engine that achieves a similar accuracy with the
human-in-the-loop system. We conclude with design implications for enabling
automated analogical inspiration engines to accelerate scientific innovation.

  retrieval in the object tracking system","29 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.DB cs.IR cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses the issue of the real-time tracking quality of moving
objects in large-scale video surveillance systems. During the tracking process,
the system assigns an identifier or label to each tracked object to distinguish
it from other objects. In such a mission, it is essential to keep this
identifier for the same objects, whatever the area, the time of their
appearance, or the detecting camera. This is to conserve as much information
about the tracking object as possible, decrease the number of ID switching
(ID-Sw), and increase the quality of object tracking. To accomplish object
labeling, a massive amount of data collected by the cameras must be searched to
retrieve the most similar (nearest neighbor) object identifier. Although this
task is simple, it becomes very complex in large-scale video surveillance
networks, where the data becomes very large. In this case, the label retrieval
time increases significantly with this increase, which negatively affects the
performance of the real-time tracking system. To avoid such problems, we
propose a new solution to automatically label multiple objects for efficient
real-time tracking using the indexing mechanism. This mechanism organizes the
metadata of the objects extracted during the detection and tracking phase in an
Adaptive BCCF-tree. The main advantage of this structure is: its ability to
index massive metadata generated by multi-cameras, its logarithmic search
complexity, which implicitly reduces the search response time, and its quality
of research results, which ensure coherent labeling of the tracked objects. The
system load is distributed through a new Internet of Video Things
infrastructure-based architecture to improve data processing and real-time
object tracking performance. The experimental evaluation was conducted on a
publicly available dataset generated by multi-camera containing different crowd
activities.

construct an efficient quantum circuit for the detection problem and to analyze
specific numbers of required qubits and quantum gates, whereas other
conventional studies have assumed that such a circuit is feasible as a quantum
oracle. To further accelerate the quantum algorithm, we also derive a
probability distribution of the objective function value and determine a unique
threshold to sample better states. Assuming a future fault-tolerant quantum
computing, our proposed algorithm has the potential for significantly reducing
query complexity in the classical domain and providing a quadratic speedup in
the quantum domain.

concepts (``the bottleneck'') and use the concepts to make predictions. A
concept bottleneck enhances interpretability since it can be investigated to
understand what concepts the model ""sees"" in an input and which of these
concepts are deemed important. However, CBMs are restrictive in practice as
they require dense concept annotations in the training data to learn the
bottleneck. Moreover, CBMs often do not match the accuracy of an unrestricted
neural network, reducing the incentive to deploy them in practice. In this
work, we address these limitations of CBMs by introducing Post-hoc Concept
Bottleneck models (PCBMs). We show that we can turn any neural network into a
PCBM without sacrificing model performance while still retaining the
interpretability benefits. When concept annotations are not available on the
training data, we show that PCBM can transfer concepts from other datasets or
from natural language descriptions of concepts via multimodal models. A key
benefit of PCBM is that it enables users to quickly debug and update the model
to reduce spurious correlations and improve generalization to new
distributions. PCBM allows for global model edits, which can be more efficient
than previous works on local interventions that fix a specific prediction.
Through a model-editing user study, we show that editing PCBMs via
concept-level feedback can provide significant performance gains without using
data from the target domain or model retraining.

on employing high-refractive-index nanostructures, owing to the strong field
confinement at deep subwavelength scales based on optically resonant effects.
However, low-index nanostructures generally exhibit weaker resonant effects and
lower field confinement. To address this issue, by harnessing the large
nonlinearity of LiNbO$\mathrm{_3}$, we propose a novel approach to employ
guided resonances and bound states in the continuum (BICs) with a
LiNbO$\mathrm{_3}$ metasurface consisting of a LiNbO$\mathrm{_3}$ disk array
sitting on a LiNbO3 thin film. Such a system can transform the guided modes
supported by LiNbO$\mathrm{_3}$ thin film into high-quality guided resonances
which can be excited directly under plane-wave illumination. Importantly, we
further demonstrate strong field confinement inside LiNbO3 thin film with
tailorable Q-factor by realising a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Such a unique mode
engineering enables a record-high SHG efficiency of 5\% under a pump intensity
as low as 0.4 $\mathrm{MW/cm^{2}}$. Moreover, we reveal the influence of
nonlinear resonances and cross-coupling on the SHG by showing the anomalous SHG
and efficiency tuning with the rotation of the crystal axis. Our work offers a
new route to constructing enhanced SHG based on high-Q guided resonances and
BICs, including low-index and high-index nonlinear materials.

spatial-temporal relationships among objects. TransSTAM consists of two major
parts: (1) The encoder utilizes the powerful self-attention mechanism of
Transformer to learn discriminative features for each tracklet; (2) The decoder
adopts the standard cross-attention mechanism to model the affinities between
the tracklets and the detections by taking both spatial-temporal and appearance
features into account. TransSTAM has two major advantages: (1) It is solely
based on the encoder-decoder architecture and enjoys a compact network design,
hence being computationally efficient; (2) It can effectively learn
spatial-temporal and appearance features within one model, hence achieving
better tracking accuracy. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple public

continuous one, and a detailed phase diagram is derived. We then show that,

embodied agent to perform action-level modality alignment, i.e., make
instruction-asked actions sequentially in complex visual environments. Most
existing VLN agents learn the instruction-path data directly and cannot
sufficiently explore action-level alignment knowledge inside the multi-modal
inputs. In this paper, we propose modAlity-aligneD Action PrompTs (ADAPT),
which provides the VLN agent with action prompts to enable the explicit
learning of action-level modality alignment to pursue successful navigation.
Specifically, an action prompt is defined as a modality-aligned pair of an
image sub-prompt and a text sub-prompt, where the former is a single-view
observation and the latter is a phrase like ''walk past the chair''. When
starting navigation, the instruction-related action prompt set is retrieved
from a pre-built action prompt base and passed through a prompt encoder to
obtain the prompt feature. Then the prompt feature is concatenated with the
original instruction feature and fed to a multi-layer transformer for action
prediction. To collect high-quality action prompts into the prompt base, we use
the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model which has powerful
cross-modality alignment ability. A modality alignment loss and a sequential
consistency loss are further introduced to enhance the alignment of the action
prompt and enforce the agent to focus on the related prompt sequentially.
Experimental results on both R2R and RxR show the superiority of ADAPT over
state-of-the-art methods.

masses inferred from binary BH merger events, may be systematically
'brightened' or 'dimmed' by the gravitational lensing effect. In this work, we
investigate the impact of gravitational lensing on the BHMF inference
considering the detection of the third-generation GW detector -- the Einstein
Telescope (ET). We focus on high redshift, $z=10$, in order to obtain the upper
limits of this effect. We use Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the data
adopting 3 original BHMFs under Un-Lensed and Lensed scenarios, then recover
the parameters of BHMFs from the mock data, and compare the difference of
results, respectively. We found that all the parameters are well recovered
within one standard deviation(std., 1$\sigma$), and all 3 BHMF models are
reconstructed within 68\% credible interval, suggesting that lensing would not
change the main structure drastically, even at very high redshifts and with
high precision of ET. And the modest influence beyond $50M_{\odot}$, depends on
the modeling of the high mass tail or substructure of BHMF. We conclude that
the impact of lensing on BHMF inference with ET can be safely ignored in the
foreseeable future. Careful handling of lensing effects is required only when
focusing on an accurate estimation of the high mass end of BHMF at high
redshifts.

view-consistent, disentangled face images and semantic masks; (2) a hybrid GAN
inversion approach that initialize the latent codes from the semantic and
texture encoder, and further optimized them for faithful reconstruction; and
(3) a canonical editor that enables efficient manipulation of semantic masks in
canonical view and product high-quality editing results. Our approach is
competent for many applications, e.g. free-view face drawing, editing, and

iteration, the proposed algorithm requires much less computations to estimate
the FK parameters. A cost function is introduced that measures the difference
of the estimates from the actual FK values. At each iteration, the problem is
decomposed into two steps. First, the estimates of the platform orientation
from the heave estimates are obtained. Then, heave estimates are updated by
moving in the gradient direction of the proposed cost function. To validate the

Because of the proximity between the RIS and the vehicles, and the large
electrical size of the RIS, we consider a 3D geometry including the elevation
angle and near-field beamforming. We provide results on RIS configuration in
terms of both coverage ratio and area-averaged rate. We find that the optimized
RIS improves the average averaged rate fifty percent over the case without a
RIS, as well as further improvements in the coverage ratio.

We numerically and field-theoretically show that its ground state belongs to a

based on density-matrix renormalization group analyses of the entanglement
entropy and the entanglement spectrum. Whereas the entanglement entropy
exhibits a critical behavior, the entanglement spectrum is nontrivially
degenerate. These entanglement properties imply that the ground state is a
gapless topological phase. We investigate the ATS model using a quantum field
theory to support the numerical findings. When the frustrated interchain
interaction is deemed a perturbation acting on the three spin chains, the
frustrated interchain interaction almost isolates the second chain from the
other two chains. However, at the same time, the second chain mediates a
ferromagnetic interaction between the first and third chains. Therefore, the
ground state of the ATS model is a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid weakly
coupled to a spin-1 Haldane chain with irrelevant interactions. Last but not

directly encode the final, classifying output signals of neural networks in
order to fuse differing networks together at the symbolic level. This allows
multiple neural networks to work together to solve a problem, with little
additional overhead. Output signals just before classification are encoded as
hypervectors and bundled together through consensus summation to train a
classification hypervector. This process can be performed iteratively and even
on single neural networks by instead making a consensus of multiple
classification hypervectors. We find that this outperforms the state of the
art, or is on a par with it, while using very little overhead, as hypervector
operations are extremely fast and efficient in comparison to the neural
networks. This consensus process can learn online and even grow or lose models
in real time. Hypervectors act as memories that can be stored, and even further
bundled together over time, affording life long learning capabilities.
Additionally, this consensus structure inherits the benefits of
Hyperdimensional Computing, without sacrificing the performance of modern
Machine Learning. This technique can be extrapolated to virtually any neural

theoretical and experimental advances in this direction achieved at USTC over
the last 20 years. We start by introducing the renowned simplest proof of

Hall measurements confirmed n-type conduction in three measured samples

We found that, first, even though the number of nodes and edges returned to
pre-pandemic levels around July 2021, the structure of the entire US domestic
airline network remained altered. We also found that the network dynamics
varied significantly from airline to airline. Full-service carriers were less
flexible in changing their network structure and suffered higher revenue
losses. On the contrary, most regional carriers completely shifted to a new

Low-cost carriers were characterized by more pronounced differences between
airlines and drastically changed their network structure immediately after the

glands (MG) and eyelids, quantitatively analyze the MG area and MG ratio,
estimate the meiboscore, and remove specular reflections from infrared images.
Methods: A total of 1600 meibography images were captured in a clinical
setting. 1000 images were precisely annotated with multiple revisions by
investigators and graded 6 times by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) experts.
Two deep learning (DL) models were trained separately to segment areas of the
MG and eyelid. Those segmentation were used to estimate MG ratio and
meiboscores using a classification-based DL model. A generative adversarial
network was implemented to remove specular reflections from original images.
Results: The mean ratio of MG calculated by investigator annotation and DL
segmentation was consistent 26.23% vs 25.12% in the upper eyelids and 32.34%
vs. 32.29% in the lower eyelids, respectively. Our DL model achieved 73.01%
accuracy for meiboscore classification on validation set and 59.17% accuracy
when tested on images from independent center, compared to 53.44% validation
accuracy by MGD experts. The DL-based approach successfully removes reflection
from the original MG images without affecting meiboscore grading. Conclusions:
DL with infrared meibography provides a fully automated, fast quantitative
evaluation of MG morphology (MG Segmentation, MG area, MG ratio, and
meiboscore) which are sufficiently accurate for diagnosing dry eye disease.
Also, the DL removes specular reflection from images to be used by

preserving and do not require storing any additional information with an
encrypted disk sector. This significantly simplifies disk encryption management
as the disk mapping does not change with encryption. On the other hand, it
forces the encryption to be deterministic when data is being overwritten and it
disallows integrity mechanisms, thus lowering security guarantees. Moreover,
because the most widely used standard encryption methods (like AES-XTS) work at
small sub-blocks of no more than 32 bytes, deterministic overwrites form an
even greater security risk. Overall, today's standard practice forfeits some
security for ease of management and performance considerations. This
shortcoming is further amplified in a virtual disk setting that supports
versioning and snapshots so that overwritten data remains accessible.
  In this work, we address these concerns and stipulate that especially with
virtual disks, there is motivation and potential to improve security at the
expense of a small performance overhead. Specifically, adding per-sector
metadata to a virtual disk allows running encryption with a random
initialization vector (IV) as well as potentially adding integrity mechanisms.
We explore how best to implement additional per-sector information in Ceph RBD,
a popular open-source distributed block storage with client-side encryption. We
implement and evaluate several approaches and show that one can run AES-XTS
encryption with a random IV at a manageable overhead ranging from 1\%--22\%,

to develop their Android apps. Unfortunately, because the Android platform and
its API evolve at an extremely rapid pace, app developers need to continually
monitor API changes to avoid compatibility issues in their apps (\ie issues
that prevent apps from working as expected when running on newer versions of
the API). Despite a large number of studies on compatibility issues in the
Android API, the research community has not yet investigated issues related to
silently-evolved methods (SEMs). These methods are functions whose behavior
might have changed but the corresponding documentation did not change
accordingly. Because app developers rely on the provided documentation to
evolve their apps, changes to methods that are not suitably documented may lead
to unexpected failures in the apps using these methods.
  To shed light on this type of issue, we conducted a large-scale empirical
study in which we identified and characterized SEMs across ten versions of the
Android API. In the study, we identified SEMs, characterized the nature of the
changes, and analyzed the impact of SEMs on a set of 1,000 real-world Android
apps. Our experimental results show that SEMs do exist in the Android API, and
that 957 of the apps we considered use at least one SEM. Based on these
results, we argue that the Android platform developers should take actions to
avoid introducing SEMs, especially those involving semantic changes. This
situation highlights the need for automated techniques and tools to help

learn the latent representation. The pair-level representation is obtained from
a cross attention module. We conduct extensive experiments on two public NLI

solution to the average order-book profile using the kinetic approach. The
dealer model is a microscopic financial model where individual traders make
decisions on limit-order prices stochastically and then reach agreements on
transactions. In the literature, this model was solved for several cases: an
exact solution for two-body traders $N=2$ and a mean-field solution for many
traders $N\gg 1$. Remarkably, while kinetic theory plays a significant role in
the mean-field analysis for $N\gg 1$, its role is still elusive for the case of
$N=2$. In this paper, we revisit the two-body dealer model $N=2$ to clarify the
utility of the kinetic theory. We first derive the exact master-Liouville
equations for the two-body dealer model by several methods. We next illustrate
the physical picture of the master-Liouville equation from the viewpoint of the
probability currents. The master-Liouville equations are then solved exactly to
derive the order-book profile and the average transaction interval.
Furthermore, we introduce a generalised two-body dealer model by incorporating
interaction between traders via the market midprice and exactly solve the model
within the kinetic framework. We finally confirm our exact solution by
numerical simulations. This work provides a systematic mathematical basis for
the econophysics model by developing better mathematical intuition.

that existing tools can indeed be reproduced, but their capabilities are quite
distinct, as confirmed by the fact that there is only a small overlap of the
results reported by the selected tools. This evidence suggests that more
efforts should be spent by our community to achieve sound compatibility issues

method for the deployment of neural networks. From a search space of
loop-optimizations, the candidate providing the best performance has to be
selected. Performance of individual configurations is evaluated through
hardware measurements. The combinatorial explosion of possible configurations,
together with the cost of hardware evaluation makes exhaustive explorations of
the search space infeasible in practice. Machine Learning methods, like random
forests or reinforcement learning are used to aid in the selection of
candidates for hardware evaluation. For general purpose hardware like x86 and
GPGPU architectures impressive performance gains can be achieved, compared to
hand-optimized libraries like cuDNN. The method is also useful in the space of
hardware accelerators with less wide-spread adoption, where a high-performance
library is not always available. However, hardware accelerators are often less
flexible with respect to their programming which leads to operator
configurations not executable on the hardware target. This work evaluates how
these invalid configurations affect the auto-tuning process and its underlying

hierarchical spherical convolutional neural networks (HS-CNNs) for
comprehensive feature learning in the spherical domain. Most existing models
employ downsampling-based pooling, which will inevitably incur information loss
and cannot adapt to different spherical signals and tasks. Besides, the
preserved information after pooling cannot be well restored by the subsequent
unpooling to characterize the desirable features for a task. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework of HS-CNNs with a lifting structure to learn adaptive
spherical wavelets for pooling and unpooling, dubbed LiftHS-CNN, which ensures
a more efficient hierarchical feature learning for both image- and pixel-level
tasks. Specifically, adaptive spherical wavelets are learned with a lifting
structure that consists of trainable lifting operators (i.e., update and
predict operators). With this learnable lifting structure, we can adaptively
partition a signal into two sub-bands containing low- and high-frequency
components, respectively, and thus generate a better down-scaled representation
for pooling by preserving more information in the low-frequency sub-band. The
update and predict operators are parameterized with graph-based attention to
jointly consider the signal's characteristics and the underlying geometries. We
further show that particular properties are promised by the learned wavelets,
ensuring the spatial-frequency localization for better exploiting the signal's
correlation in both spatial and frequency domains. We then propose an unpooling
operation that is invertible to the lifting-based pooling, where an inverse
wavelet transform is performed by using the learned lifting operators to
restore an up-scaled representation. Extensive empirical evaluations on various
spherical domain tasks validate the superiority of the proposed LiftHS-CNN.

the introduction of a new sign, the NULL sign, in addition to the conventional
in and out labels. The existence of the null sign could stop the formation of a
closed isosurface derived from the bisector of the in/out regions. Further, we

field strengths which can not be integrated to a local action without auxiliary
fields. Yet, its covariant divergence consistently vanishes after iterating the
equation, realizing a spin-1 analogue of `minimal massive gravity', which has
been dubbed `third way consistent'. In this note, we show that after
dualization of the three-dimensional gauge fields, the model possesses a
natural action as a Chern-Simons coupled gauged sigma model. In this dual
formulation, coupling to matter and to gravity becomes straightforward. As a
direct application, we derive the coupling of the model to N=1 supergravity.

semantically decompose 3D space without the need for re-training and enable us
to semantically select and edit regions in the radiance field. Our experiments

particular case of radial conductivities in the ball $B_R \subset \mathbb{R}^3
$ of radius $R$, in which the linearization of the Calder\'on problem is
equivalent to a Hausdorff moment problem. We give numerical evidences that the
Born approximation is well defined for $L^{\infty}$ conductivities, and we
present a novel numerical algorithm to reconstruct a radial conductivity from
the Born approximation under a suitable smallness assumption. We also show that
the Born approximation has depth-dependent uniqueness and approximation
capabilities depending on the distance (depth) to the boundary $\partial B_R$.
We then investigate how increasing the radius $R$ affects the quality of the
Born approximation, and the existence of a scattering limit as $R\to \infty$.
Similar properties are also illustrated in the inverse boundary problem for the
Schr\""odinger operator $-\Delta +q$, and strong recovery of singularity results
are observed in this case.

(AGN) outshines the host galaxy by an order of magnitude. The only exception to
this may be at minimum light when the AGN activity is so low that the host
galaxy may make quite a considerable contribution to the photometric intensity
of the source. Such a dip or a fade in the intensity of OJ 287 occurred in
November 2017, when its brightness was about 1.75 magnitudes lower than the
recent mean level. We compare the observations of this fade with similar fades
in OJ 287 observed earlier in 1989, 1999, and 2010. It appears that there is a
relatively strong reddening of the B$-$V colours of OJ 287 when its V-band
brightness drops below magnitude 17. Similar changes are also seen V$-$R,
V$-$I, and R$-$I colours during these deep fades. These data support the
conclusion that the total magnitude of the host galaxy is $V=18.0 \pm 0.3$,
corresponding to $M_{K}=-26.5 \pm 0.3$ in the K-band. This is in agreement with
the results, obtained using the integrated surface brightness method, from
recent surface photometry of the host. These results should encourage us to use
the colour separation method also in other host galaxies with strongly variable
AGN nuclei. In the case of OJ 287, both the host galaxy and its central black
hole are among the biggest known, and its position in the black hole
mass-galaxy mass diagram lies close to the mean correlation.

the semantic of the input data, such as label information, we propose an

decoded samples of these two types of autoencoders exhibit faint dissimilarity

adversarial attacks to learning algorithms that rely on the latent

a practical and useful technique for many real-world applications. Recently,
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a rendering technique that uses neural networks
to approximate classical ray tracing, have been considered as one of the
promising approaches for synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of images.
We find that NeRF can render new views while maintaining geometric consistency,
but it does not properly maintain skin details, such as moles and pores. These
details are important particularly for faces because when we look at an image
of a face, we are much more sensitive to details than when we look at other
objects. On the other hand, 3D Morpable Models (3DMMs) based on traditional
meshes and textures can perform well in terms of skin detail despite that it
has less precise geometry and cannot cover the head and the entire scene with
background. Based on these observations, we propose a method to use both NeRF
and 3DMM to synthesize a high-fidelity novel view of a scene with a face. Our
method learns a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to mix a NeRF-synthesized
image and a 3DMM-rendered image and produces a photorealistic scene with a face
preserving the skin details. Experiments with various real-world scenes
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code will be available on

The photometric and spectral evolutions of SN 2019np resembles the average

decline rate are $M_{\rm max}(B)=-19.52 \pm 0.47$mag and $\Delta m_{\rm15}(B)

perhaps suggests the presence of an additional energy source beyond the
radioactive decay of central nickel. Comparing the observed color evolution
with that predicted by different models such as interactions of SN ejecta with
circumstellar matter (CSM)/companion star, a double-detonation explosion from a
sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD), and surface $^{56}$Ni mixing, the

Three distinct modes of aerobreakup are identified for a wide range of Weber

precise disease prediction by capturing individual differences in multivariate

heterogeneity exists in health data at the individual level and that complex
health factors are involved in the development of chronic diseases. However, it
remains a challenge to identify individual physiological state changes in
cross-disease onset processes because of the complex relationships among
multiple biomarkers. Here, we present the health-disease phase diagram (HDPD),
which represents a personal health state by visualizing the boundary values of
multiple biomarkers that fluctuate early in the disease progression process. In
HDPDs, future onset predictions are represented by perturbing multiple
biomarker values while accounting for dependencies among variables. We
constructed HDPDs for 11 non-communicable diseases (NCDs) from a longitudinal
health checkup cohort of 3,238 individuals, comprising 3,215 measurement items
and genetic data. Improvement of biomarker values to the non-onset region in
HDPD significantly prevented future disease onset in 7 out of 11 NCDs. Our
results demonstrate that HDPDs can represent individual physiological states in
the onset process and be used as intervention goals for disease prevention.

and black-hole solutions in the framework of five-dimensional braneworld
models. The main motivation for studying such theories stems from the
Randall-Sundrum model, which was formulated by Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum
back in 1999. We investigate thoroughly the physical characteristics of
analytic solutions which concern both black strings and five-dimensional
localized black holes. To be more precise, the black-string solutions emerge in
the context of a five-dimensional scalar-tensor theory, where the brane
line-element is found to describe a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime.
The cases of de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and Minkowski branes are examined
separately and in great detail. As far as the five-dimensional black holes are
concerned, at first, we present an ""algorithm"" that one may use in order to
construct from first principles the geometry of analytic and exponentially
localized five-dimensional braneworld black holes. In each case, the point-like
singularity of the black hole lies entirely on the 3-brane, while its event
horizon is exponentially localized close to the 3-brane thus exhibiting a
pancake shape. In the first case, the induced line-element on the brane assumes
the form of the Schwarzschild solution while the bulk geometry is effectively
AdS$_5$ outside the horizon. In the second case, the induced brane geometry is
described by the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-(A)dS line-element, where a careful
classification of the horizons takes place as well. In both cases, the derived
geometry is supported by an anisotropic fluid in the bulk described only by two
independent components, the energy density and tangential pressure, whereas no
matter needs to be introduced on the brane for its consistent embedding in the
bulk.

accurate diagnosis of cognitive diseases. The technique of neuroimaging, such
as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), provides a noninvasive means of observing
the aging process within the brain. With longitudinal image data collection,
data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have been used to
examine brain aging. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms tend to be
restricted to group-level predictions and suffer from unreal predictions. This
paper proposes a methodology for generating longitudinal MRI scans that capture
subject-specific neurodegeneration and retain anatomical plausibility in aging.
The proposed methodology is developed within the framework of diffeomorphic
registration and relies on three key novel technological advances to generate
subject-level anatomically plausible predictions: i) a computationally
efficient and individualized generative framework based on registration; ii) an
aging generative module based on biological linear aging progression; iii) a
quality control module to fit registration for generation task. Our methodology
was evaluated on 2662 T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI scans from 796 participants from
three different cohorts. First, we applied 6 commonly used criteria to
demonstrate the aging simulation ability of the proposed methodology; Secondly,
we evaluated the quality of the synthetic images using quantitative
measurements and qualitative assessment by a neuroradiologist. Overall, the
experimental results show that the proposed method can produce anatomically
plausible predictions that can be used to enhance longitudinal datasets, in
turn enabling data-hungry AI-driven healthcare tools.

  Prediction","CVPR2022 (Oral)",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the task of action-driven stochastic human motion prediction,
which aims to predict multiple plausible future motions given a sequence of
action labels and a short motion history. This differs from existing works,
which predict motions that either do not respect any specific action category,
or follow a single action label. In particular, addressing this task requires
tackling two challenges: The transitions between the different actions must be
smooth; the length of the predicted motion depends on the action sequence and
varies significantly across samples. As we cannot realistically expect training
data to cover sufficiently diverse action transitions and motion lengths, we
propose an effective training strategy consisting of combining multiple motions
from different actions and introducing a weak form of supervision to encourage
smooth transitions. We then design a VAE-based model conditioned on both the
observed motion and the action label sequence, allowing us to generate multiple
plausible future motions of varying length. We illustrate the generality of our
approach by exploring its use with two different temporal encoding models,
namely RNNs and Transformers. Our approach outperforms baseline models
constructed by adapting state-of-the-art single action-conditioned motion
generation methods and stochastic human motion prediction approaches to our new

these large-scale expansion patterns: feedback-driven expansion from a previous
generation of massive stars, and expansion as a result of the turbulent
velocity field in the primordial molecular cloud. While it is tempting to
attribute such large-scale expansion patterns to feedback processes, we find
that the observed kinematics are fully consistent with the turbulent origin,
and therefore that the injection of further energy or momentum from feedback is
not required. Similar conclusions may be drawn for other star forming regions

  Retrieval","Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR). First
  two authors contributed equally",,,,"cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase retrieval is the problem of reconstructing images from magnitude-only
measurements. In many real-world applications the problem is underdetermined.
When training data is available, generative models allow optimization in a
lower-dimensional latent space, hereby constraining the solution set to those
images that can be synthesized by the generative model. However, not all
possible solutions are within the range of the generator. Instead, they are
represented with some error. To reduce this representation error in the context
of phase retrieval, we first leverage a novel variation of intermediate layer
optimization (ILO) to extend the range of the generator while still producing
images consistent with the training data. Second, we introduce new
initialization schemes that further improve the quality of the reconstruction.
With extensive experiments on the Fourier phase retrieval problem and thorough
ablation studies, we can show the benefits of our modified ILO and the new
initialization schemes. Additionally, we analyze the performance of our
approach on the Gaussian phase retrieval problem.

are governed by the backward Feynman-Kac equation. In this paper, the local
discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is used to solve the 2D backward
Feynman-Kac equation in a rectangular domain. The spatial semi-discrete LDG
scheme of the equivalent form (obtained by Laplace transform) of the original
equation is established. After discussing the properties of the fractional
substantial calculus, the stability and optimal convergence rates $O(h^{k+1})$
of the semi-discrete scheme are proved by choosing an appropriate generalized
numerical flux. The $L1$ scheme on the graded meshes is used to deal with the
weak singularity of the solution near the initial time. Based on the
theoretical results of a semi-discrete scheme, we investigate the stability and
convergence of the fully discrete scheme, which shows the optimal convergence
rates $O(h^{k+1}+\tau^{\min\{2-\alpha,\gamma\delta\}})$. Numerical experiments
are carried out to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme. In
addition, we also verify the effect of the central numerical flux on the
convergence rates and the condition number of the coefficient matrix.

to train NNs with a few data. The main challenge is how to avoid overfitting
since over-parameterized NNs can easily overfit to such small dataset. Previous
work (e.g. MAML by Finn et al. 2017) tackles this challenge by meta-learning,
which learns how to learn from a few data by using various tasks. On the other
hand, one conventional approach to avoid overfitting is restricting hypothesis
spaces by endowing sparse NN structures like convolution layers in computer
vision. However, although such manually-designed sparse structures are
sample-efficient for sufficiently large datasets, they are still insufficient
for few-shot learning. Then the following questions naturally arise: (1) Can we
find sparse structures effective for few-shot learning by meta-learning? (2)
What benefits will it bring in terms of meta-generalization? In this work, we
propose a novel meta-learning approach, called Meta-ticket, to find optimal
sparse subnetworks for few-shot learning within randomly initialized NNs. We
empirically validated that Meta-ticket successfully discover sparse subnetworks
that can learn specialized features for each given task. Due to this task-wise
adaptation ability, Meta-ticket achieves superior meta-generalization compared
to MAML-based methods especially with large NNs. The code is available at:

of mixing ratio $\eta$ of the two colors with the total pulse energy conserved.
Energy transfer from the laser pulse to the electronic system in silicon is
dramatically enhanced by simultaneous dual-color irradiation and maximized at
$\eta\sim 0.5$. Increased is the number of generated carriers, not the absorbed
energy per carrier. The effect is more efficient for lower IR photon energy, or
equivalently, larger vector-potential amplitude. As the underlying mechanism is
identified the interplay between intraband electron motion in the {\it valence}
band (before excitation) driven by the IR component and resonant
valence-to-conduction interband excitation (carrier injection) induced by the
UV component. The former increases excitable electrons which pass through the
$k$ points of resonant transitions. The effect of different multiphoton
absorption paths or intraband motion of carriers generated in the conduction
band play a minor role.

priorities over debt contracts). We distinguish between priorities that are
chosen endogenously or exogenously. For endogenous priorities and standard
(maximal) clearing, the games exhibit a coalitional form of weak acyclicity. A
strong equilibrium exists and can be reached after a polynomial number of
deviations. Moreover, there is a strong equilibrium that is optimal for a wide
variety of social welfare functions. In contrast, for minimal clearing there
are games in which no optimal strategy profile exists, even for standard
utilitarian social welfare. Perhaps surprisingly, a strong equilibrium still
exists and, for a wide range of strategies, can be reached after a polynomial
number of deviations. In contrast, for exogenous priorities, equilibria can be
absent and equilibrium existence is NP-hard to decide, for both minimal and

Alfv\'en waves propagating along the magnetic field lines which are partially
reflected along their path. These waves are the root cause for auroral
emission, which is subdivided into the Io Footprint (IFP), its tail and leading
spot. New observations of the Juno spacecraft by Mura et al. (2018) have shown
puzzling substructure of the footprint and its tail. In these observations, the
symmetry between the poleward and equatorward part of the footprint tail is
broken and the tail spots are alternatingly displaced. We show that the
location of these bright spots in the tail are consistent with Alfv\'en waves
reflected at the boundary of the Io torus and Jupiter's ionosphere. Then, we
investigate three different mechanisms to explain this phenomenon: (1) The Hall
effect in Io's ionosphere, (2) travel time differences of Alfv\'en waves
between Io's Jupiter facing and its opposing side and (3) asymmetries in Io's
atmosphere. For that, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations within an
idealized geometry of the system. We use the Poynting flux near the Jovian
ionosphere as a proxy for the morphology of the generated footprint and its
tail. We find that the Hall effect is the most important mechanism under
consideration to break the symmetry causing the ""Alternating Alfv\'en spot
street"". The travel time differences contributes to enhance this effect. We
find no evidence that the inhomogeneities in Io's atmosphere contribute
significantly to the location or shape of the tail spots.

changing meteorological conditions imposed by climate change. To enable that
transformation, a community of practice in energy-climate modelling has started
to form that aims to better integrate energy system models with weather and
climate models. Here, we evaluate the disconnects between the energy system and
climate modelling communities, then lay out a research agenda to bridge those
disconnects. In the near-term, we propose interdisciplinary activities for
expediting uptake of future climate data in energy system modelling. In the
long-term, we propose a transdisciplinary approach to enable development of (1)
energy-system-tailored climate datasets for historical and future
meteorological conditions and (2) energy system models that can effectively
leverage those datasets. This agenda increases the odds of meeting ambitious
climate mitigation goals by systematically capturing and mitigating climate
risk in energy sector decision making.

in machine learning. However, the majority of commonly used differentiable
causal discovery methods are non-identifiable, turning this problem into a
continuous optimization task prone to data biases. In many real-life
situations, data is collected from different environments, in which the
functional relations remain consistent across environments, while the
distribution of additive noises may vary. This paper proposes Differentiable
Invariant Causal Discovery (DICD), utilizing the multi-environment information
based on a differentiable framework to avoid learning spurious edges and wrong
causal directions. Specifically, DICD aims to discover the
environment-invariant causation while removing the environment-dependent
correlation. We further formulate the constraint that enforces the target
structure equation model to maintain optimal across the environments.
Theoretical guarantees for the identifiability of proposed DICD are provided
under mild conditions with enough environments. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets verify that DICD outperforms state-of-the-art
causal discovery methods up to 36% in SHD. Our code will be open-sourced.

and effective method to correct for ionospheric effects, with an evaluation on
data obtained with GRAVES, the French space surveillance radar. This method
relies on GPS data, and our evaluation relies on GRAVES and DORIS data. We
found that the gain in terms of evaluated radial velocity can be as high as

the network on the synchronization manifold. The second, ""fast"", corresponds to
that of the synchronization errors. We present a framework to analyse the
emergent dynamics based on the behavior of the slow dynamics. Firstly, we give
conditions under which if the slow dynamics admits a globally asymptotically
stable equilibrium, so does the networked systems. Secondly, we give conditions
under which, if the slow dynamics admits an asymptotically stable orbit and a
single unstable equilibrium point, there exists a unique periodic orbit that is
almost-globally asymptotically stable. The emergent behavior is thus clear, the
systems asymptotically synchronize in frequency and, in the limit, as the

turbulence. However, these scaling laws are not new and have already been
derived and discussed in Bahri (2016). No novel analytical achievements are
made by Sadeghi & Oberlack, as the title of their study misleadingly wants to
suggest. In fact, the already established self-similar scaling laws obtained by
Bahri through simple dimensional analysis are already more general in the
application than the ones obtained by Sadeghi & Oberlack through an overly
complicated and therefore unnecessarily performed Lie-group symmetry analysis.
The claim that it has the virtue of not being an ad-hoc method is not true.
Because, instead of using an a priori set of scales as the classical method,
the Lie-group method has to make use of an a priori set of symmetries, namely
to select the correct relevant symmetries from an infinite and thus unclosed
set. For example, a nonphysical scaling symmetry is selected which in the
course of the analysis has to be discarded since it is not compatible with the
data simulated. Hence, the Lie-group symmetry method in turbulence is just
another common trial-and-error method and not a first-principle method that can

node classification task, where a key point lies in how to sufficiently
leverage the limited but valuable label information. Most of the classical GNNs
solely use the known labels for computing the classification loss at the
output. In recent years, several methods have been designed to additionally
utilize the labels at the input. One part of the methods augment the node
features via concatenating or adding them with the one-hot encodings of labels,
while other methods optimize the graph structure by assuming neighboring nodes
tend to have the same label. To bring into full play the rich information of
labels, in this paper, we present a label-enhanced learning framework for GNNs,
which first models each label as a virtual center for intra-class nodes and
then jointly learns the representations of both nodes and labels. Our approach
could not only smooth the representations of nodes belonging to the same class,
but also explicitly encode the label semantics into the learning process of
GNNs. Moreover, a training node selection technique is provided to eliminate
the potential label leakage issue and guarantee the model generalization
ability. Finally, an adaptive self-training strategy is proposed to iteratively
enlarge the training set with more reliable pseudo labels and distinguish the
importance of each pseudo-labeled node during the model training process.
Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate our
approach can not only consistently outperform the state-of-the-arts, but also
effectively smooth the representations of intra-class nodes.

needed to find good solutions that are more efficient by being more sample
efficient. This paper presents a new reinforcement learning approach that is
based on entropy. In addition, we design an off-policy-based reinforcement
learning technique that maximises the expected return and improves the sample
efficiency to achieve faster learning during training time. We systematically
evaluate our approach on a range of route optimisation tasks typically used to
evaluate learning-based optimisation, such as the such as the Travelling
Salesman problems (TSP), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). In this
paper, we show that our model can generalise to various route problems, such as
the split-delivery VRP (SDVRP), and compare the performance of our method with
that of current state-of-the-art approaches. The Empirical results show that
the proposed method can improve on state-of-the-art methods in terms of
solution quality and computation time and generalise to problems of different
sizes.

via connection weights and biases. In MTO-CT, an inter-task knowledge transfer
module is designed to transfer knowledge between different tasks, where the
most helpful source tasks are selected by using the probability matching and
stochastic universal selection, and evolutionary operations like mutation and
crossover are performed for reusing the knowledge from selected source tasks in
a target task. We use electricity consumption data from five states in
Australia to design two sets of tasks at different scales: a) one-step ahead
prediction for each state (five tasks) and b) 6-step, 12-step, 18-step, and
24-step ahead prediction for each state (20 tasks). The performance of MTO-CT
is evaluated on solving each of these two sets of tasks in comparison to
solving each task in the set independently without knowledge sharing under the

site. The rover was equipped, among other instruments, with two Lunar
Penetrating Radar systems (LPR) having a working frequency of 60 and 500 MHz.
The radars acquired data for about two weeks while the rover was slowly moving
along a path of about 114 m. At Navigation point N0209 the rover got stacked
into the lunar soil and after that only data at fixed position could be

the performance relative to state-of-the-art approaches.

this paper addresses the problem of model predictive control (MPC) design for

existing solutions for FCS-MPC penalize the output tracking error and the
control input rate of change, which can lead to arbitrary switching among the
available discrete control inputs and unpredictable steady-state behavior. To
improve the steady-state behavior of FCS-MPC, in this paper we design a cost
function that penalizes the tracking error with respect to a state and input
steady-state limit cycle. We prove that if a suitable terminal cost is added to
the FCS-MPC algorithm convergence to the limit cycle is ensured. The developed
methodology is validated in direct switching control of a power amplifier for
high-precision motion systems, where it significantly improves the steady-state

next best frontier for the robot such that new ground can be covered in a fast,

selection method that also contributes to the safe navigation of autonomous

The framework presented in this work bifurcates the exploration problem in
local and global exploration. The proposed exploration framework is also
adaptable according to computational resources available onboard the robot
which means the trade-off between the speed of exploration and the quality of
the map can be made. Such capability allows the proposed framework to be
deployed in a subterranean exploration, mapping as well as in fast search and
rescue scenarios. The overall system is considered a low-complexity and

detailed simulation studies with comparisons made against a high-level

challenging because discriminator is prone to overfitting. Previously proposed
differentiable augmentation demonstrates improved data efficiency of training
GANs. However, the augmentation implicitly introduces undesired invariance to
augmentation for the discriminator since it ignores the change of semantics in
the label space caused by data transformation, which may limit the
representation learning ability of the discriminator and ultimately affect the
generative modeling performance of the generator. To mitigate the negative
impact of invariance while inheriting the benefits of data augmentation, we
propose a novel augmentation-aware self-supervised discriminator that predicts
the augmentation parameter of the augmented data. Particularly, the prediction
targets of real data and generated data are required to be distinguished since
they are different during training. We further encourage the generator to
adversarially learn from the self-supervised discriminator by generating
augmentation-predictable real but not fake data. This formulation connects the
learning objective of the generator and the arithmetic$-$harmonic mean
divergence under certain assumptions. We compare our method with
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using the class-conditional BigGAN and
unconditional StyleGAN2 architectures on data-limited CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
FFHQ, LSUN-Cat, and five low-shot datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements of our method over SOTA methods in training
data-efficient GANs.

Networks (GNNs) have shown powerful reasoning capability in many relational
tasks. However, the currently used graph search space overemphasizes learning
node features and neglects mining hierarchical relational information.
Moreover, due to diverse mechanisms in the message passing, the graph search
space is much larger than that of CNNs. This hinders the straightforward
application of classical search strategies for exploring complicated graph
search space. We propose Automatic Relation-aware Graph Network Proliferation
(ARGNP) for efficiently searching GNNs with a relation-guided message passing
mechanism. Specifically, we first devise a novel dual relation-aware graph
search space that comprises both node and relation learning operations. These
operations can extract hierarchical node/relational information and provide
anisotropic guidance for message passing on a graph. Second, analogous to cell
proliferation, we design a network proliferation search paradigm to
progressively determine the GNN architectures by iteratively performing network
division and differentiation. The experiments on six datasets for four graph
learning tasks demonstrate that GNNs produced by our method are superior to the
current state-of-the-art hand-crafted and search-based GNNs. Codes are

  https://github.com/lee-group-cmu/lf2i",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Predictive algorithms, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), are used in many
domain sciences to directly estimate internal parameters of interest in
simulator-based models, especially in settings where the observations include
images or other complex high-dimensional data. In parallel, modern neural
density estimators, such as normalizing flows, are becoming increasingly
popular for uncertainty quantification, especially when both parameters and
observations are high-dimensional. However, parameter inference is an inverse
problem and not a prediction task; thus, an open challenge is to construct
conditionally valid and precise confidence regions, with a guaranteed
probability of covering the true parameters of the data-generating process, no
matter what the (unknown) parameter values are, and without relying on
large-sample theory. Many simulator-based inference (SBI) methods are indeed
known to produce biased or overly confident parameter regions, yielding
misleading uncertainty estimates. This paper presents WALDO, a novel method for
constructing confidence regions with finite-sample conditional validity by
leveraging prediction algorithms or posterior estimators that are currently
widely adopted in SBI. WALDO reframes the well-known Wald test statistic, and
uses a computationally efficient regression-based machinery for classical
Neyman inversion of hypothesis tests. We apply our method to a recent
high-energy physics problem, where prediction with DNNs has previously led to
estimates with prediction bias. We also illustrate how our approach can correct
overly confident posterior regions computed with normalizing flows.

a Monte Carlo event generator. Comparisons are made to the stand-alone
generators BcVegPy and GenXicc. New methods of speeding up Pythia simulations
for events containing heavy quarks are described, enabling the production of
large samples with multiple heavy-quark pairs. We show that significantly
higher production rates of doubly-heavy hadrons are predicted in models that
allow heavy quarks originating from different parton-parton interactions
(within the same hadron-hadron collision) to combine to form such hadrons.
Quantitative predictions are sensitive to the modelling of colour
reconnections. We suggest a set of experimental measurements capable of
differentiating these additional contributions.

systems at which not only eigenenergies but also the corresponding eigenstates
coalesce. This is in strong contrast to degeneracies known from conservative
systems, so-called diabolic points, at which only eigenenergies degenerate.
Here we connect these two kinds of degeneracies by introducing the concept of
the distance of a given exceptional point in matrix space to the set of
diabolic points. We prove that this distance determines an upper bound for the
response strength of a non-Hermitian system with this exceptional point. A
small distance therefore implies a weak spectral response to perturbations and
a weak intensity response to excitations. This finding has profound
consequences for physical realizations of exceptional points that rely on
perturbing a diabolic point. Moreover, we exploit this concept to analyze the
limitations of the spectral response strength in passive systems. A number of
optical and photonics systems are investigated to illustrate the theory.

studied using observations of hydrogen radio recombination lines and a detailed
multiwavelength characterization of the massive star-forming region W33 Main is
performed. We used the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to observe the
H167$\alpha$ recombination line at 1.4 GHz at an angular resolution of 10
arcsec, and Karl. G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) data acquired in the GLOSTAR
survey to study the dynamics of ionized gas. We also observed the radio
continuum at 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz with the GMRT and used GLOSTAR 4$-$8 GHz
continuum data to characterize the nature of the radio emission. In addition,
archival data from submillimeter to near-infrared wavelengths were used to
study the dust emission and identify YSOs in the W33 Main star-forming region.
The radio recombination lines were detected at good signal to noise in the
GLOSTAR data, while the H167$\alpha$ radio recombination line was marginally
detected with the GMRT. The spectral index of radio emission in the region
determined from GMRT and GLOSTAR shows the emission to be thermal in the entire
region. Along with W33 Main, an arc-shaped diffuse continuum source,
G12.81$-$0.22, was detected with the GMRT data. The GLOSTAR recombination line
data reveal a velocity gradient across W33 Main and G12.81$-$0.22. The electron
temperature is found to be 6343 K and 4843 K in W33 Main and G12.81$-$0.22,
respectively. The physical properties of the W33 Main molecular clump were
derived by modeling the dust emission using data from the ATLASGAL and Hi-GAL
surveys and they are consistent with the region being a relatively evolved site
of massive star formation. The gas dynamics and physical properties of
G12.81$-$0.22 are consistent with the HII region being in an evolved phase and
its expansion on account of the pressure difference is slowing down.

cavity-mediated excitonic correlations, and dephasing in the presence of
phonon-induced dissipation. The non-classicality of the entangled biphoton
sources is shown to enhance the ultra-fast and broadband correlation features
of the signal, giving an indication about the underlying state correlations
responsible for long-range cavity-assisted exciton migration.

with a stochastic process. To introduce stochastic processes, whose values are
valid rating matrices, we noticed the geometric properties of stochastic
matrices and its link to matrix Lie groups. We give a gentle introduction to
this topic and demonstrate how It\^o-SDEs in R will generate the desired model
for rating transitions. To calibrate the rating model to historical data, we
use a Deep-Neural-Network (DNN) called TimeGAN to learn the features of a time
series of historical rating matrices. Then, we use this DNN to generate
synthetic rating transition matrices. Afterwards, we fit the moments of the
generated rating matrices and the rating process at specific time points, which
results in a good fit. After calibration, we discuss the quality of the
calibrated rating transition process by examining some properties that a time
series of rating matrices should satisfy, and we will see that this geometric
approach works very well.

reinforcement learning (RL) to boost the sample efficiency, the theoretical
understanding of why and how it works is still limited. Most previous
analytical works could only assume that the representation function is already
known to the agent or from linear function class, since analyzing general
function class representation encounters non-trivial technical obstacles such
as generalization guarantee, formulation of confidence bound in abstract
function space, etc. However, linear-case analysis heavily relies on the
particularity of linear function class, while real-world practice usually
adopts general non-linear representation functions like neural networks. This
significantly reduces its applicability. In this work, we extend the analysis
to general function class representations. Specifically, we consider an agent
playing $M$ contextual bandits (or MDPs) concurrently and extracting a shared
representation function $\phi$ from a specific function class $\Phi$ using our
proposed Generalized Functional Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (GFUCB). We
theoretically validate the benefit of multitask representation learning within

allowed automated accounts, known as social bots, to gain ground. As
highlighted by other researchers, most of these bots have malicious purposes
and tend to mimic human behavior, posing high-level security threats on OSN
platforms. Moreover, recent studies have shown that social bots evolve over
time by reforming and reinventing unforeseen and sophisticated characteristics,
making them capable of evading the current machine learning state-of-the-art
bot detection systems. This work is motivated by the critical need to establish
adaptive bot detection methods in order to proactively capture unseen evolved
bots towards healthier OSNs interactions. In contrast with most earlier
supervised ML approaches which are limited by the inability to effectively
detect new types of bots, this paper proposes CALEB, a robust end-to-end
proactive framework based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(CGAN) and its extension, Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), to simulate bot
evolution by creating realistic synthetic instances of different bot types.
These simulated evolved bots augment existing bot datasets and therefore
enhance the detection of emerging generations of bots before they even appear!
Furthermore, we show that our augmentation approach overpasses other earlier
augmentation techniques which fail at simulating evolving bots. Extensive
experimentation on well established public bot datasets, show that our approach
offers a performance boost of up to 10% regarding the detection of new unseen
bots. Finally, the use of the AC-GAN Discriminator as a bot detector, has
outperformed former ML approaches, showcasing the efficiency of our end to end

However, most of the current approaches to build unsupervised BWEs do not

effective are: 1) using identical words as seed lexicons (which unsupervised
approaches incorrectly assume are not available for orthographically distinct
language pairs) and 2) combining such lexicons with pairs extracted by matching
romanized versions of words with an edit distance threshold. We experiment on
thirteen non-Latin languages (and English) and show that such cheap signals
work well and that they outperform using more complex unsupervised methods on
distant language pairs such as Chinese, Japanese, Kannada, Tamil, and Thai. In

order to overcome the fundamental dynamical limitation due to hot carrier
injection by providing a carrier transport path from a cold carrier reservoir.
The tunneling process itself depends on band alignment between quantum-dot
levels and the injector quantum well, especially as in these devices LO-phonon
scattering is dominant. Quantum dots with their first excited state near the
quantum well bottom profit most from tunnel coupling. As inhomogeneous
broadening is omnipresent in quantum dot structures, this implies that
individual members of the ensemble couple differently to the injector quantum
well. Quantum dots with higher energy profit less, as the phonon couples to
higher, less occupied states. Likewise, if the energy difference between ground
state and quantum well exceeds the LO phonon energy, scattering becomes
increasingly inefficient. Therefore, within 20-30meV we find Quantum Dots that
benefit substantially different from the tunnel coupling. Furthermore, in
quantum dots with increasing confinement depth, excited states become
sucessively confined. Here, scattering gets more efficient again, as subsequent
excited states reach the phonon resonance with the quantum well bottom. Our
results provide guidelines for the optimization of tunnel-injection lasers.
Theoretical results for electronic state caluluations in connection with

significance for the challenging multi-class segmentation of fundus lesions
because different lesions vary significantly in scales and shapes. Several
methods have been proposed to successfully handle the multi-scale object
segmentation. However, two issues are not considered in previous studies. The
first is the lack of interaction between adjacent feature levels, and this will
lead to the deviation of high-level features from low-level features and the
loss of detailed cues. The second is the conflict between the low-level and
high-level features, this occurs because they learn different scales of
features, thereby confusing the model and decreasing the accuracy of the final
prediction. In this paper, we propose a progressive multi-scale consistent
network (PMCNet) that integrates the proposed progressive feature fusion (PFF)
block and dynamic attention block (DAB) to address the aforementioned issues.
Specifically, PFF block progressively integrates multi-scale features from
adjacent encoding layers, facilitating feature learning of each layer by
aggregating fine-grained details and high-level semantics. As features at
different scales should be consistent, DAB is designed to dynamically learn the
attentive cues from the fused features at different scales, thus aiming to
smooth the essential conflicts existing in multi-scale features. The two
proposed PFF and DAB blocks can be integrated with the off-the-shelf backbone
networks to address the two issues of multi-scale and feature inconsistency in
the multi-class segmentation of fundus lesions, which will produce better
feature representation in the feature space. Experimental results on three
public datasets indicate that the proposed method is more effective than recent

similar items to a query in a large collection of images. Hashing aims to learn
a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal
retrieval performance, producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization
error to bridge the gap between the learning stage's continuous relaxation and
the inference stage's discrete quantization is important. However, in the
existing deep supervised hashing methods, coding balance and low-quantization
error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this
is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are
heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This
paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization
constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is
re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a
pre-defined discrete, uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing
the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally
efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the
hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys
lower time and sample complexities. The proposed single-loss quantization
objective can be integrated into any existing supervised hashing method to
improve code balance and quantization error. Experiments confirm that the
proposed approach substantially improves the performance of several

learning dynamic radiance fields. The core of DeVRF is to model both the 3D
canonical space and 4D deformation field of a dynamic, non-rigid scene with
explicit and discrete voxel-based representations. However, it is quite
challenging to train such a representation which has a large number of model
parameters, often resulting in overfitting issues. To overcome this challenge,
we devise a novel static-to-dynamic learning paradigm together with a new data
capture setup that is convenient to deploy in practice. This paradigm unlocks
efficient learning of deformable radiance fields via utilizing the 3D
volumetric canonical space learnt from multi-view static images to ease the
learning of 4D voxel deformation field with only few-view dynamic sequences. To
further improve the efficiency of our DeVRF and its synthesized novel view's
quality, we conduct thorough explorations and identify a set of strategies. We
evaluate DeVRF on both synthetic and real-world dynamic scenes with different

these models by solving the linearised Einstein-Boltzmann system usually takes
tens of CPU core-seconds per model, making the entire process very

  In this paper we present \textsc{connect}, a neural network framework
emulating \textsc{class} computations as an easy-to-use plug-in for the popular

neural network which emulates the observables usually computed by
\textsc{class}. The training data is generated using \textsc{class}, but using
a novel algorithm for generating favourable points in parameter space for
training data, the required number of \textsc{class}-evaluations can be reduced
by two orders of magnitude compared to a traditional inference run. Once
\textsc{connect} has been trained for a given model, no additional training is
required for different dataset combinations, making \textsc{connect} many
orders of magnitude faster than \textsc{class} (and making the inference
process entirely dominated by the speed of the likelihood calculation).
  For the models investigated in this paper we find that cosmological parameter
inference run with \textsc{connect} produces posteriors which differ from the
posteriors derived using \textsc{class} by typically less than $0.01$--$0.1$

adapt to previously unseen tasks, based on small amounts of data. One of the
most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning approaches is Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this method is to learn the general
weights of the meta-model, which are further adapted to specific problems in a
small number of gradient steps. However, the model's main limitation lies in
the fact that the update procedure is realized by gradient-based optimisation.
In consequence, MAML cannot always modify weights to the essential level in one
or even a few gradient iterations. On the other hand, using many gradient steps
results in a complex and time-consuming optimization procedure, which is hard
to train in practice, and may lead to overfitting. In this paper, we propose
HyperMAML, a novel generalization of MAML, where the training of the update
procedure is also part of the model. Namely, in HyperMAML, instead of updating
the weights with gradient descent, we use for this purpose a trainable
Hypernetwork. Consequently, in this framework, the model can generate
significant updates whose range is not limited to a fixed number of gradient
steps. Experiments show that HyperMAML consistently outperforms MAML and
performs comparably to other state-of-the-art techniques in a number of
standard Few-Shot learning benchmarks.

explicitly embed the global semantics to enrich the representations. In this
paper, we propose Omni-Granular Ego-Semantic Propagation for Self-Supervised
Graph Representation Learning (OEPG). Specifically, we introduce
instance-adaptive global-aware ego-semantic descriptors, leveraging the first-
and second-order feature differences between each node/graph and hierarchical
global clusters of the entire graph dataset. The descriptors can be explicitly
integrated into local graph convolution as new neighbor nodes. Besides, we
design an omni-granular normalization on the whole scales and hierarchies of
the ego-semantic to assign attentional weight to each descriptor from an
omni-granular perspective. Specialized pretext tasks and cross-iteration
momentum update are further developed for local-global mutual adaptation. In
downstream tasks, OEPG consistently achieves the best performance with a 2%~6%
accuracy gain on multiple datasets cross scales and domains. Notably, OEPG also
generalizes to quantity- and topology-imbalance scenarios.

voting rules have access to only the rankings induced by these utilities. We
evaluate how well voting rules do on measures of social welfare and of
proportional fairness, computed based on the hidden utility functions.
  In particular, we study the distortion of voting rules, which is a worst-case
measure. It is an approximation ratio comparing the utilitarian social welfare
of the optimum outcome to the welfare of the outcome selected by the voting
rule, in the worst case over possible input profiles and utility functions that
are consistent with the input. The literature has studied distortion with
unit-sum utility functions, and left a small asymptotic gap in the best
possible distortion. Using tools from the theory of fair multi-winner
elections, we propose the first voting rule which achieves the optimal
distortion $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ for unit-sum utilities. Our voting rule also
achieves optimum $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ distortion for unit-range and approval
utilities.
  We then take a similar worst-case approach to a quantitative measure of the
fairness of a voting rule, called proportional fairness. Informally, it
measures whether the influence of cohesive groups of agents on the voting
outcome is proportional to the group size. We show that there is a voting rule
which, without knowledge of the utilities, can achieve an $O(\log

a consequence of its proportional fairness, we show that this voting rule
achieves $O(\log m)$ distortion with respect to Nash welfare, and provides an
$O(\log m)$-approximation to the core, making it interesting for applications

component of technologies such as autonomous driving and augmented reality.
State-of-the-art localization approaches often rely on image retrieval
techniques for one of two purposes: (1) provide an approximate pose estimate or
(2) determine which parts of the scene are potentially visible in a given query
image. It is common practice to use state-of-the-art image retrieval algorithms
for both of them. These algorithms are often trained for the goal of retrieving
the same landmark under a large range of viewpoint changes which often differs
from the requirements of visual localization. In order to investigate the
consequences for visual localization, this paper focuses on understanding the
role of image retrieval for multiple visual localization paradigms. First, we
introduce a novel benchmark setup and compare state-of-the-art retrieval
representations on multiple datasets using localization performance as metric.
Second, we investigate several definitions of ""ground truth"" for image
retrieval. Using these definitions as upper bounds for the visual localization
paradigms, we show that there is still sgnificant room for improvement. Third,
using these tools and in-depth analysis, we show that retrieval performance on
classical landmark retrieval or place recognition tasks correlates only for
some but not all paradigms to localization performance. Finally, we analyze the
effects of blur and dynamic scenes in the images. We conclude that there is a
need for retrieval approaches specifically designed for localization paradigms.

the inclusion of clause weights, learnable parameters that represent the

show through analysis and simulation, this can work either against the system
-- or for it. Based on this, we propose a differentiable framework for
strategically-robust learning of graph-based classifiers. Experiments on
several real networked datasets demonstrate the utility of our approach.

fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such

highly challenging as it requires joint optimization over shape, radiance, and
pose. This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the
wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. Standard pose estimation
techniques fail in such image collections in the wild due to very few estimated
correspondences across images. Furthermore, NeRF cannot relight a scene under
any illumination, as it operates on radiance (the product of reflectance and
illumination). We propose a joint optimization framework to estimate the shape,
BRDF, and per-image camera pose and illumination. Our method works on
in-the-wild online image collections of an object and produces relightable 3D

between de-orbiting or injecting space objects and satellite constellations.
Considering the first to be subjected to a continuous tangential acceleration,
its spiraling motion would result in a series of close approaches in the
proximity of a constellation. The proposed methodology involves the integration
of the collision probability density function on the encounter plane, from
which two analytical formulas, one for the number of close approaches and one
for their respective average collision probability, are obtained. The
mathematical description of the crossing dynamics relies on the assumption of
circular orbits and independent collision probabilities, but does not require
to propagate the satellites' orbit. A comparison with a conventional
propagation method has been performed for validation purposes, proving its
accuracy also in case of elliptical crossing orbits. The model developed has
been used to assess the risk connected to constellation's satellites
replacement, once they have reached their programmed End-of-Life. The
environmental impact of the full replacement of 12 approved constellations is
analysed by means of average collision probability. In particular, it is shown
that the key features for space exploitation sustainability are the maximum
propulsion available from the thruster, the selection of an optimal crossing
orbit and the true anomaly phases between constellations' and crossing
satellites. The consequences of an in-orbit collision are also investigated by
assessing the collision risk generated by the formation of a debris cloud. The
results corroborate the need for international standards for space traffic
management as an exponentially increasing satellites population could trigger a
chain reaction of collisions, making LEO inaccessible for decades.

desired target state. It is not obvious that the two approaches can be
combined, since reaching the dispersive regime, in which system and cavities
exchange excitations only virtually, can be spoiled by driving-induced resonant
transitions. However, working in the extended Floquet space and treating both
system-cavity coupling as well as driving-induced excitation processes on the
same footing perturbatively, we identify regimes, where reservoir engineering
of targeted Floquet states is possible and accurately described by an effective
time-independent master equation. We successfully benchmark our approach for

demonstrate that this maximum likelihood estimator yields a higher fidelity

thorough grasp of the SUT and its application domain. Thus, Kanewala et al.
proposed the Predicting Metamorphic Relations (PMR) approach to automatically
suggest MRs from a list of six pre-defined MRs for testing newly developed
methods. PMR is based on a classification model trained on features extracted
from the control-flow graph (CFG) of 100 Java methods. In our replication
study, we explore the generalizability of PMR. First, we rebuild the entire
preprocessing and training pipeline and repeat the original study in a close
replication to verify the reported results and establish the basis for further
experiments. Second, we perform a conceptual replication to explore the
reusability of the PMR model trained on CFGs from Java methods in the first
step for functionally identical methods implemented in Python and C++. Finally,
we retrain the model on the CFGs from the Python and C++ methods to investigate
the dependence on programming language and implementation details. We were able
to successfully replicate the original study achieving comparable results for
the Java methods set. However, the prediction performance of the Java-based
classifiers significantly decreases when applied to functionally equivalent
Python and C++ methods despite using only CFG features to abstract from
language details. Since the performance improved again when the classifiers
were retrained on the CFGs of the methods written in Python and C++, we
conclude that the PMR approach can be generalized, but only when classifiers
are developed starting from code artefacts in the used programming language.

simulator models with intractable likelihood. Recently, many works trained
neural networks to approximate either the intractable likelihood or the
posterior directly. Most proposals use normalizing flows, namely neural
networks parametrizing invertible maps used to transform samples from an
underlying base measure; the probability density of the transformed samples is
then accessible and the normalizing flow can be trained via maximum likelihood
on simulated parameter-observation pairs. A recent work [Ramesh et al., 2022]
approximated instead the posterior with generative networks, which drop the
invertibility requirement and are thus a more flexible class of distributions
scaling to high-dimensional and structured data. However, generative networks
only allow sampling from the parametrized distribution; for this reason, Ramesh
et al. [2022] follows the common solution of adversarial training, where the
generative network plays a min-max game against a ""critic"" network. This
procedure is unstable and can lead to a learned distribution underestimating
the uncertainty - in extreme cases collapsing to a single point. Here, we
propose to approximate the posterior with generative networks trained by
Scoring Rule minimization, an overlooked adversarial-free method enabling
smooth training and better uncertainty quantification. In simulation studies,
the Scoring Rule approach yields better performances with shorter training time

Gaussian processes that can exhibit anomalous diffusion. In the systems
considered, the noise correlation function is not necessarily related to
friction. Thus, there is no conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR)
of the second kind and no unique way to define a temperature. We start from a
Markovian process with time-dependent diffusivity (an example being scaled
Brownian motion). It turns out that standard stochastic thermodynamic notions
can be applied rather straightforwardly by introducing a time-dependent
temperature, yielding the integral fluctuation relation. We then proceed to our
focal system, that is, a particle undergoing fractional Brownian motion (FBM).
In this system, the noise is Gaussian but the noise correlation function is
nonlocal in time, defining a non- Markovian process. We analyse in detail the
consequences when using the conventional notions of stochastic thermodynamics
with a constant medium temperature. In particular, the heat calculated from
dissipation into the medium differs from the log ratio of path probabilities of
forward and backward motion, yielding a deviation from the standard integral
fluctuation relation for the total entropy production if the latter is defined
via system entropy and heat exchange. These apparent inconsistencies can be
circumvented by formally defining a time-nonlocal temperature that fulfils a
generalized FDR. To shed light on the rather abstract quantities resulting from
the latter approach we perform a perturbation expansion. This allows us to
calculate analytically, up to linear order, the generalized temperature and the
corresponding heat exchange. By this, we provide explicit expressions and a
physical interpretation for the leading corrections induced by
non-Markovianity.

characteristics of circumstellar disks, stars, and their planetary companions
can be inferred by studying the interdependence of planetary and host star
properties. Numerous studies in the past have confirmed that high-mass giant
planets are commonly found around metal-rich stars, while the stellar hosts of
low-mass planets have a wide range of metallicity. In this work, we analyzed
the detailed chemical abundances for a sample of $>900$ exoplanet hosting stars
drawn from different radial velocity and transit surveys. We correlate the
stellar abundance trends for $\alpha$ and iron-peak elements with the planets'
mass. We find the planet mass-abundance correlation to be primarily negative
for $\alpha$-elements and marginally positive or zero for the iron-peak
elements, indicating that stars hosting giant planets are relatively younger.
This is further validated by the age of the host stars obtained from isochrone
fitting. The later enrichment of protoplanetary material with iron and
iron-peak elements is also consistent with the formation of the giant planets
via the core accretion process. A higher metal fraction in the protoplanetary
disk is conducive to rapid core growth, thus providing a plausible route for
the formation of giant planets. This study, therefore, indicates the observed
trends in stellar abundances and planet mass are most likely a natural
consequence of Galactic chemical evolution.

important mechanism that supports autonomous adjustment of computing resources

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been introduced as a promising approach to
learn the resource management policies to guide the scaling actions under the
dynamic and uncertain cloud environment. However, RL methods face the following
challenges in steering predictive autoscaling, such as lack of accuracy in
decision-making, inefficient sampling and significant variability in workload
patterns that may cause policies to fail at test time. To this end, we propose
an end-to-end predictive meta model-based RL algorithm, aiming to optimally
allocate resource to maintain a stable CPU utilization level, which
incorporates a specially-designed deep periodic workload prediction model as
the input and embeds the Neural Process to guide the learning of the optimal
scaling actions over numerous application services in the Cloud. Our algorithm
not only ensures the predictability and accuracy of the scaling strategy, but
also enables the scaling decisions to adapt to the changing workloads with high
sample efficiency. Our method has achieved significant performance improvement
compared to the existing algorithms and has been deployed online at Alipay,

accuracy and precision it is necessary to know the star as accurately and
precisely as possible. Our immediate aim is to characterize in a homogeneous
and accurate way a sample of 27 transiting planet-hosting stars observed within
the GAPS program. We determined stellar parameters (effective temperature,
surface gravity, rotational velocity) and abundances of 26 elements
(Li,C,N,O,Na,Mg,Al,Si,S,Ca,Sc,Ti,V,Cr,Fe,Mn,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn,Y,Zr,Ba,La,Nd,Eu). Our
study is based on high-resolution HARPS-N@TNG and FEROS@ESO spectra and uniform
techniques. We derived kinematic properties from Gaia data and estimated for
the first time in exoplanet host stars ages using elemental ratios as chemical
clocks. Teff of our stars is of 4400-6700 K, while [Fe/H] is within -0.3 and
0.4 dex. Lithium is present in 7 stars. [X/H] and [X/Fe] abundances vs [Fe/H]
are consistent with the Galactic Chemical Evolution. The dependence of [X/Fe]
with the condensation temperature is critically analyzed with respect to
stellar and kinematic properties. All targets with measured C and O abundances
show C/O<0.8, compatible with Si present in rock-forming minerals. Most of
targets show 1.0<Mg/Si<1.5, compatible with Mg distributed between olivine and
pyroxene. HAT-P-26, the target hosting the lowest-mass planet, shows the
highest Mg/Si ratio. From our chemo-dinamical analysis we find agreement
between ages and position within the Galactic disk. We note a tendency for
higher density planets to be around metal-rich stars and hints of higher
stellar abundances of some volatiles for lower mass planets. We cannot exclude
that part of our results could be also related to the location of the stars
within the Galactic disk. We trace the planetary migration scenario from the
composition of the planets related to the chemical composition of the hosting
stars

compact region of the Euclidean plane modeling wireless interactions. In this
model, users arrive at a constant rate and leave at a rate function of the
interference created by other users in the network. The novelty of this work
lies in the addition of service differentiation, inspired by bandwidth
partitioning present in 5G networks: users are allocated a fixed number of
frequency bands and only interfere with transmissions on these bands. The first
result of the paper is the determination of the critical user arrival rate
below which the system is stochastically stable, and above which it is
unstable. The analysis requires symmetry assumptions which are defined in the
paper. The proof for this result uses stochastic monotonicity and fluid limit
models. The monotonicity allows one to bound the dynamics from above and below
by two adequate discrete-state Markov jump processes, for which we obtain
stability and instability results using fluid limits. This leads to a closed
form expression for the critical arrival rate. The second contribution consists
in two heuristics to estimate the steady-state densities of all classes of
users in the network: the first one relies on a Poisson approximation of the
steady-state processes. The second one uses a cavity approximation leveraging
second-order moment measures, which leads to more accurate estimates of the
steady-state user densities. The Poisson heuristic also gives a good estimate

two deformed cavities that are linearly coupled to the motion of mechanical
mirrors, and the cavities are coupled to each other by transmission strength
parameter. This study shows that compared to non-deformed cases, the deformed
system exhibits more rapid phase transition at the positions of transparency
windows, causing stronger and enhanced fast and slow light phenomena. Moreover,
in the region $0<q<0.5$, the optomechanical system results in gain.
Additionally, for a fixed deformation of cavities, by tuning the tunneling
strength and optomechanical coupling, one can observe a delay and advancement
in probe field in the order of milliseconds and even above milliseconds for
fine-tuning of the coupling parameters. Finally, the bridge between
mathematical and physical models is built by assuming the deformation to be a
primitive root of unity, which indicates a class of anyon models. These results
demonstrate that $q$-deformation provides a novel method for manipulating and
significantly enhancing optical phenomena not only in arbitrarily deformed

  Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space Science",,"10.1007/s10509-022-04091-0",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mass (M) of a star can be evaluated from its spectroscopically determined
effective temperature (T _eff) and metallicity ([Fe/H]) along with the
luminosity (L; derived from parallax), while comparing them with grids of
theoretical evolutionary tracks. It has been argued, however, that such a
track-based mass (M_trk) may tend to be overestimated for the case of red
giants. Meanwhile, there is an alternative approach of evaluating mass (M_gLT)
directly from surface gravity (g), L, and T_eff. The practical reliability of
M_gLT was examined for ~100 benchmark giants in the Kepler field, for which
atmospheric parameters are already determined and the reliable mass (M_seis)
along with the evolutionary status are known from asteroseismology. In
addition, similar check was also made for the accuracy of M_trk for comparison.
It turned out that, while a reasonable correlation is seen between M_gLT and
M_seis almost irrespective of the stellar property, its precision is rather
insufficient because log(M_gLT/M_seis) distributes rather widely within
~+/-0.2--0.3dex. In contrast, the reliability of M_trk was found to depend on
the evolutionary status. Although M_trk and M_seis are satisfactorily
consistent with each other (typical dispersion of log(M_trk}/M_seis) is within
~+/-0.1dex) for H-burning red giants as well as He-burning 2nd clump giants of
higher mass, M_trk tends to be considerably overestimated as compared to M_seis
by up to ~<0.4~dex for He-burning 1st clump giants of lower mass. Accordingly,
M_gLT and M_trk are complementary with each other in terms of their
characteristic merit and demerit.

patients during cardiac and respiratory arrest. This procedure externally
activates the cardiac and respiratory systems via the delivery of chest
compression and artificial ventilation. As the main purpose of CPR is to
recirculate the blood flow, prediction of the myocardium behavior has great
importance. This prediction allows us to have a better understanding of the
needed force to recirculate blood without hurting the heart. Finite element
method offer the possibility of noninvasive quantification of myocardial
deformation. This method is attractive to use for the assessment of myocardial
function. To investigate the behavior of the heart wall, a 3D model of thoracic
organs has been prepared using medical images. In this study, to simulate the
behavior of different organs, Code-Aster open software is used. For every
organ, the material properties are defined. The most important parameters in
the study are displacement, normal stress, and Von-Mises stress in the
myocardium. Using these parameters, displacement and stress distribution have
been predicted. Effects of the applied force on the chest during CPR and
deformation of the myocardium have been predicted by the finite element model.
A linear deformation is observable for each organ during force application.
Besides, the final location of the heart and ribs and also involved parameters
in predicting myocardium deformation are extracted from the model simulations.
This finite element model enables us to have a good vision of the deformation
of the myocardium during CPR. Using this method, it is possible to predict the
deformation of every part of the heart, especially right and left ventricles.

achieved with at most $N(N+1)$ neurons in each hidden layer (where $N$ is the

comes from maximizing the total similarity over positive pairs, while the
negative pairs are needed to avoid collapse. In this work, we note that the

thus limits the information content of the supervisory signal available to
train representations. We propose to go beyond contrasting individual pairs of
objects by focusing on contrasting objects as sets. For this, we use
combinatorial quadratic assignment theory designed to evaluate set and graph

of investigating the mixing mechanism in the interior of low-mass giant stars
by examining the abundance anomalies of these elements possibly affected by the
evolution-induced dredge-up of nuclear burning products. Special attention was
paid to check the recent theoretical stellar evolution simulations indicating
the importance of thermohaline mixing in low-mass stars (M <~1 M_sun), which is
expected to be more significant as the metallicity is lowered. By inspecting
the resulting abundances in comparison with those of unevolved metal-poor
dwarfs at the same metallicity, the deficiency in C as well as enrichment in N
was confirmed (while O is almost unchanged), the extent of peculiarities
tending to increase with a decrease in [Fe/H]. Accordingly, the [C/N] ratio
turned out to progressively decrease towards lower metallicity from ~0
(Fe/H]~0) to ~-1 ([Fe/H]~-1.5), which is reasonably consistent with the
theoretical prediction in the presence of thermohaline mixing. However, these
RR Lyr stars do not show any apparent Na anomaly (i.e., essentially the same
[Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends as those of dwarfs), despite that
metallicity-dependent overabundance in Na is theoretically expected for the
case of non-canonical mixing. This inconsistency between C/N and Na may suggest
a necessity of further improvement in the current theory.

surrounding region. To drive learning of such representations, we follow a
VAE-based approach and introduce a prior for particle positions based on a
spatial-softmax architecture, and a modification of the evidence lower bound
loss inspired by the Chamfer distance between particles. We demonstrate that
our DLP representations are useful for downstream tasks such as unsupervised
keypoint (KP) detection, image manipulation, and video prediction for scenes
composed of multiple dynamic objects. In addition, we show that our
probabilistic interpretation of the problem naturally provides uncertainty
estimates for particle locations, which can be used for model selection, among

for resource estimation. In binary quantum systems, some efficient
implementation of arithmetic operations like, addition/subtraction,
multiplication/division, square root, exponential and arcsine etc. have been
realized, where resources are reported as a number of Toffoli gates or T gates
with ancilla. Recently it has been demonstrated that intermediate qutrits can
be used in place of ancilla, allowing us to operate efficiently in the
ancilla-free frontier zone. In this article, we have incorporated intermediate
qutrit approach to realize efficient implementation of all the quantum
arithmetic operations mentioned above with respect to gate count and
circuit-depth without T gate and ancilla. Our resource estimates with
intermediate qutrits could guide future research aimed at lowering costs
considering arithmetic operations for computational problems. As an application
of computational problems, related to finance, are poised to reap the benefit
of quantum computers, in which quantum arithmetic circuits are going to play an
important role. In particular, quantum arithmetic circuits of arcsine and
square root are necessary for path loading using the re-parameterization
method, as well as the payoff calculation for derivative pricing. Hence, the
improvements are studied in the context of the core arithmetic circuits as well
as the complete application of derivative pricing. Since our intermediate
qutrit approach requires to access higher energy levels, making the design
prone to errors, nevertheless, we show that the percentage decrease in the
probability of error is significant owing to the fact that we achieve circuit
robustness compared to qubit-only works.

native phoneme categories, versus the idea that rich, fine-grained phonetic
representations tuned to the statistics of the native language, are sufficient.
We operationalize this idea using representations from two state-of-the-art
speech models, a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model and the more recent
wav2vec 2.0 model. We present a new, open dataset of French- and
English-speaking participants' speech perception behaviour for 61 vowel sounds

than fine-grained phonetic modelling, both for the discrimination behaviour as
a whole, and for predicting differences in discriminability associated with
differences in native language background. We also show that wav2vec 2.0, while
not good at capturing the effects of native language on speech perception, is
complementary to information about native phoneme assimilation, and provides a
good model of low-level phonetic representations, supporting the idea that both
categorical and fine-grained perception are used during speech perception.

from (limited) data introduces statistical errors that may lead to unexpected

probabilities but instead use so-called uncertainty sets in the transitions,
accounting for such limited data. Tools from the formal verification community
efficiently compute robust policies that provably adhere to formal

manifestations such as dynamically anomalous chiral currents and skin effect.
We study the interplay between symmetries and disorder in a paradigmatic model
for spectral topology - the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We
numerically study the effect of disorder in on-site and non-reciprocal hopping
terms. Using a real-space winding number, we investigate the impact of disorder
on the spectral topology and the anomalous chiral modes under periodic boundary
conditions. We discover a remarkable robustness of chiral current under
disorder. The value of the chiral current retains the clean system value, is
independent of disorder strength and is tracked completely by the real-space
winding number for class A which has no symmetries, and class AIII, which has a
sub-lattice symmetry. In class $D^\dagger$, which has $PT$-symmetric on-site
gain and loss terms, we find that the disorder-averaged current is not robust
while the winding number is robust. We study the localization physics using the
inverse participation ratio and local density of states. As the disorder
strength is increased, a mobility-edge phase with a finite winding appears. The
abrupt vanishing of the winding number marks a transition from a partially
localized to a fully localized phase. Under open boundary conditions, we
observe a series of transitions through skin effect-partial skin effect-no skin
effect phases. Further, we study the non-Hermitian Anderson skin effect (NHASE)
for different symmetry classes, where the system without skin effect develops a
disorder-driven skin effect at intermediate disorder values. Remarkably while
NHASE is present for different classes, the real-space winding number shows a
direct correspondence with it only when all symmetries are broken.

schemes such as code division multiple access and orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing falls quickly without channel state information. Obtaining the
amount of channel information required for these techniques to work is costly
and difficult, which suggests the need for schemes which can perform well
without channel state information. In this work, we present one such scheme,
called wideband time frequency coding, which achieves rates on the order of the
additive white Gaussian noise capacity without requiring any channel state
information. Wideband time frequency coding combines impulsive frequency shift
keying with pulse position modulation, which allows for information to be
encoded in both the transmitted frequency and the transmission time period. On
the detection side, we propose a non-coherent decoder based on a square-law
detector, akin to the optimal decoder for frequency shift keying based signals.
The impacts of various parameters on the symbol error probability and capacity
of wideband time frequency coding are investigated, and the results show that
it is robust to shadowing and highly fading channels. When compared to other
modulation schemes such as code division multiple access, orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing, pulse position modulation, and impulsive frequency shift
keying without channel state information, wideband time frequency coding
achieves higher rates in the wideband regime, and performs comparably in

depending on their goals. To make machine learning accountable to society, one
important goal is to get actionable options for recourse, which allow an
affected user to change the decision $f(x)$ of a machine learning system by
making limited changes to its input $x$. We formalize this by providing a
general definition of recourse sensitivity, which needs to be instantiated with
a utility function that describes which changes to the decisions are relevant
to the user. This definition applies to local attribution methods, which
attribute an importance weight to each input feature. It is often argued that
such local attributions should be robust, in the sense that a small change in
the input $x$ that is being explained, should not cause a large change in the
feature weights. However, we prove formally that it is in general impossible
for any single attribution method to be both recourse sensitive and robust at
the same time. It follows that there must always exist counterexamples to at
least one of these properties. We provide such counterexamples for several
popular attribution methods, including LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients and
SmoothGrad. Our results also cover counterfactual explanations, which may be
viewed as attributions that describe a perturbation of $x$. We further discuss
possible ways to work around our impossibility result, for instance by allowing
the output to consist of sets with multiple attributions, and we provide
sufficient conditions for specific classes of continuous functions to be
recourse sensitive. Finally, we strengthen our impossibility result for the
restricted case where users are only able to change a single attribute of $x$,
by providing an exact characterization of the functions $f$ to which
impossibility applies.

representation which decouples moving objects, including their shadows, from
the static background. Our method represents the moving objects and the static

temporal changes. A naive implementation of this approach leads to the dynamic
component taking over the static one as the representation of the former is
inherently more general and prone to overfitting. To this end, we propose a

a field-induced quantum spin liquid state, in which the reported large thermal
Hall effect close to the half-quantized value still remains a subject of
debate. Recently, oscillatory structures of the magnetothermal conductivity
were reported and interpreted as quantum oscillations of charge-neutral
particles. To investigate the origin of these oscillatory structures, we
performed a comprehensive measurement of the in-plane magnetothermal
conductivity $\kappa(H)$ down to low temperature (100 mK), as well as
magnetization $M$, for single crystals grown by two different techniques:
Bridgman and chemical vapor transport. The results show a series of dips in
$\kappa(H)$ and peaks in the field derivative of $M$ located at the same fields
independent of the growth method. We argue that these structures originate from
field-induced phase transitions rather than quantum oscillations. The positions
of several of these features are temperature-dependent and connected to the
magnetic phase transitions in zero field: the main transition at 7 K and weaker
additional transitions which likely arise from secondary phases at 10 K and 13
K. In contrast to what is expected for quantum oscillations, the magnitude of
the structure in $\kappa(H)$ is smaller for the higher conductivity crystal and
decreases rapidly upon cooling below 1 K.

Bellman's optimality equation, we discuss an optimal algorithm that is
exponential in the number of target states. Then, we tradeoff optimality for

certain classes of Markov decision processes. We extend this algorithm to the
multi-agent case by proposing a heuristic partitioning algorithm of assigning

optimal partitions for environments where the targets are naturally clustered.
We present the performance of our algorithms on random Markov decision

discussed within a Bayesian inference framework applied to a set of models
based on a density-dependent relativistic mean-field description of hadronic
matter. Nuclear matter properties, hypernuclei properties, and observational
information are used to constrain the models. General properties of neutron
stars such as the maximum mass, radius, tidal deformability, proton fraction,
hyperon fraction, and speed of sound are discussed. It is shown that the two
solar mass constraint imposes that neutron stars described by equations of
state that include hyperons have on average a larger radius, $\gtrsim 0.5$km,
and a larger tidal deformability, $\gtrsim 150$, than the stars determined from
a nucleonic equation of state, while the speed of sound at the center of the
star is more than 25\% smaller. If a 1.4 M$_\odot$ star with a radius $\lesssim
12.5$ km is measured it is quite improbable that a massive star described by
the same model contains hyperons. A similar conclusion is drawn if a two solar
mass star with a radius $\lesssim 11.5$ km or a neutron star with a mass above
2.2 M$_\odot$ is observed: the possible hyperon content of these stars is ruled
out or very reduced. The hyperon presence inside neutron stars is compatible
with the present NICER mass-radius observations of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451

that if the polytropic index $\gamma=\partial\ln p/\partial\ln\epsilon$ takes
values of the order of 1.75 at not too large densities, it may indicate the
onset of some kind of exotic matter, but not necessarily of deconfined quark
matter.

  We propose a novel RDW technique that leverages the temporary blindness

our approach does not impose additional eye-tracking hardware requirements.
Instead, SaccadeNet, a deep neural network, is trained on head rotation data to
predict saccades in real-time during an apparent head rotation. Rigid
transformations are then applied to the virtual environment for redirection
during the onset duration of these saccades. However, SaccadeNet is only
effective when combined with moderate cognitive workload that elicits repeated
head rotations.

collection in our second user study. Then, after some fine-tuning experiments,
the performance of our RDW technique is evaluated in a third user study.
Finally, we present the results demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. It
allowed users to walk up a straight virtual distance of at least 38 meters from

this challenge, we propose geometry-consistent neural implicit surfaces
learning for multi-view reconstruction. We theoretically analyze that there
exists a gap between the volume rendering integral and point-based signed

zero-level set of SDF networks and explicitly perform multi-view geometry
optimization by leveraging the sparse geometry from structure from motion (SFM)
and photometric consistency in multi-view stereo. This makes our SDF
optimization unbiased and allows the multi-view geometry constraints to focus

is in danger. So far, numerous methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of
Schizophrenia (SZ) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), among
which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) modalities are known as a
popular method among physicians. This paper presents an SZ and ADHD intelligent
detection method of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) modality using a new deep
learning method. The University of California Los Angeles dataset, which
contains the rs-fMRI modalities of SZ and ADHD patients, has been used for
experiments. The FMRIB software library toolbox first performed preprocessing
on rs-fMRI data. Then, a convolutional Autoencoder model with the proposed
number of layers is used to extract features from rs-fMRI data. In the
classification step, a new fuzzy method called interval type-2 fuzzy regression
(IT2FR) is introduced and then optimized by genetic algorithm, particle swarm
optimization, and gray wolf optimization (GWO) techniques. Also, the results of
IT2FR methods are compared with multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors,
support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, and adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system methods. The experiment results show that the
IT2FR method with the GWO optimization algorithm has achieved satisfactory
results compared to other classifier methods. Finally, the proposed
classification technique was able to provide 72.71% accuracy.

  Decentralized Multi-Agent General-Sum Games","the paper will be updated soon",,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While various multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have been proposed
in cooperative settings, few works investigate how self-interested learning
agents achieve mutual coordination in decentralized general-sum games and
generalize pre-trained policies to non-cooperative opponents during execution.
In this paper, we present Generalizable Risk-Sensitive Policy (GRSP). GRSP
learns the distributions over agent's return and estimate a dynamic
risk-seeking bonus to discover risky coordination strategies. Furthermore, to
avoid overfitting to training opponents, GRSP learns an auxiliary opponent
modeling task to infer opponents' types and dynamically alter corresponding
strategies during execution. Empirically, agents trained via GRSP can achieve
mutual coordination during training stably and avoid being exploited by
non-cooperative opponents during execution. To the best of our knowledge, it is
the first method to learn coordination strategies between agents both in
iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) and iterated stag hunt (ISH) without shaping
opponents or rewards, and firstly consider generalization during execution.
Furthermore, we show that GRSP can be scaled to high-dimensional settings.

it difficult to apply in practice. In this paper, building on the progress
surrounding the modular method from the last two decades, we analyze and expand
the current limits of this program by developing all the necessary ingredients
to use Frey abelian varieties for two Diophantine applications.
  In the first application, we use a multi-Frey approach combining two Frey
elliptic curves over totally real fields, a Frey hyperelliptic over
$\mathbb{Q}$ due to Kraus, and ideas from the Darmon program to give a complete
resolution of the generalized Fermat equation $$x^7 + y^7 = 3 z^n$$ for all
integers $n \ge 2$. The use of higher dimensional Frey abelian varieties allows
a more efficient proof of the above result due to additional structures that
they afford.
  In the second application, we use some of the additional structures that Frey
abelian varieties possess to give an asymptotic resolution of the generalized
Fermat equation $$x^{11} + y^{11} = z^p$$ for solutions locally away from
$xy=0$ and where $p$ is a prime exponent. In this application, the use of
higher dimensional Frey abelian varieties helps to overcome the computational
difficulties arising when working in large spaces of Hilbert modular forms.

(RegularizedUSM) as defined by Bodek and Feldman [BF22]. In this problem, you
are given a non-monotone non-negative submodular function $f:2^{\mathcal N}\to
\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ and a linear function $\ell:2^{\mathcal N}\to \mathbb R$
over the same ground set $\mathcal N$, and the objective is to output a set
$T\subseteq \mathcal N$ approximately maximizing the sum $f(T)+\ell(T)$.
Specifically, an algorithm is said to provide an $(\alpha,\beta)$-approximation
for RegularizedUSM if it outputs a set $T$ such that $\mathbb
E[f(T)+\ell(T)]\ge \max_{S\subseteq \mathcal N}[\alpha \cdot f(S)+\beta\cdot
\ell(S)]$. We also study the setting where $S$ and $T$ are subject to a matroid
constraint, which we refer to as Regularized Constrained Submodular
Maximization (RegularizedCSM).
  For both RegularizedUSM and RegularizedCSM, we provide improved
$(\alpha,\beta)$-approximation algorithms for the cases of non-positive $\ell$,
non-negative $\ell$, and unconstrained $\ell$. In particular, for the case of
unconstrained $\ell$, we are the first to provide nontrivial
$(\alpha,\beta)$-approximations for RegularizedCSM, and the $\alpha$ we obtain
for RegularizedUSM is superior to that of [BF22] for all $\beta\in (0,1)$.
  In addition to approximation algorithms, we provide improved
inapproximability results for all of the aforementioned cases. In particular,
we show that the $\alpha$ our algorithm obtains for RegularizedCSM with
unconstrained $\ell$ is tight for $\beta\ge \frac{e}{e+1}$. We also show
0.478-inapproximability for maximizing a submodular function where $S$ and $T$

family of similarity solutions depending on parameters $\lambda$ and $\kappa$.
  Requiring locally finite amounts of mass, momentum, and energy imply certain
constraints on $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. Further constraints are imposed for
particular types of flows. E.g., Guderley's pioneering construction of an
unbounded converging shock wave invading a quiescent fluid, requires $\kappa=0$
and $\lambda>1$.
  In this work we analyze the regime $0<\lambda<1$, which does not appear to

Guderley shock solutions; (ii) existence of bounded and continuous incoming
similarity flows in 3-d provided $\kappa$ takes the value
$\hat\kappa=\frac{2(1-\lambda)}{\gamma-1}$, $\lambda$ is sufficiently small,
and $\gamma$ is sufficiently large; (iii) continuation of the latter flows
beyond collapse as globally defined and continuous similarity solutions.
  A key feature of these solutions is that they, in contrast to Guderley
solutions, remain bounded at time of collapse, while the density, velocity, and
sound speed all suffer gradient blowup. It is noteworthy that, notwithstanding
infinite gradients at collapse, no shock wave appears. The analysis is based on
a combination of analytical and numerical calculations.

Pareto-based algorithms fail to provide sufficient selection pressure towards
the Pareto front, whilst recently developed algorithms, such as
decomposition-based ones, may struggle to maintain a set of well-distributed

Another issue in some many-objective optimizers is rapidly increasing
computational requirement with the number of objectives, such as

  homotopy type theory","69 pages",,,,"math.AT math.CT math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Informally, an orbifold is a smooth space whose points may have finitely many
internal symmetries. Formally, however, the notion of orbifold has been
presented in a number of different guises -- from Satake's V-manifolds to
Moerdijk and Pronk's proper \'etale groupoids -- which do not on their face
resemble the informal definition. The reason for this divergence between
formalism and intuition is that the points of spaces cannot have internal
symmetries in traditional, set-level foundations. The extra data of these
symmetries must be carried around and accounted for throughout the theory. More
drastically, maps between orbifolds presented in the usual ways cannot be
defined pointwise.
  In this paper, we will put forward a definition of orbifold in synthetic
differential cohesive homotopy type theory: an orbifold is a microlinear type
for which the type of identifications between any two points is properly
finite. In homotopy type theory, a point of a type may have internal
symmetries, and we will be able to construct examples of orbifolds by defining
their type of points directly. Moreover, the mapping space between two
orbifolds is merely the type of functions.
  We will justify this synthetic definition by proving, internally, that every
proper \'etale groupoid is an orbifold. In this way, we will show that the
synthetic theory faithfully extends the usual theory of orbifolds. Along the
way, we will investigate the microlinearity of higher types such as \'etale
groupoids, showing that the methods of synthetic differential geometry
generalize gracefully to higher analogues of smooth spaces. We will also
investigate the relationship between the Dubuc-Penon and open-cover definitions
of compactness in synthetic differential geometry, and show that any discrete,
Dubuc-Penon compact subset of a second-countable manifold is subfinitely
enumerable.

having much lower trapping efficiency, depth, and harmonicity compared to 3D

fabrication is more complex, limiting potential to scale. We describe new
'trench' geometries that exist in the design space between these two paradigms.
They still allow for a simple, planar electrode layer but with much more

histories, that are called consistent, obey classical probability rules. It has
been argued that these sets can describe the semi-classical behaviour of closed
quantum systems. Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent
sets and one can view each consistent set as a separate context. Using
propositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to
paradoxes such as the contrary inferences first noted by Kent [Physical Review
Letters, 78(15):2874, 1997]. Proponents of the consistent histories formulation
argue that one should not mix propositions coming from different consistent
sets in making logical arguments, and that paradoxes such as the aforementioned
contrary inferences are nothing else than the usual microscopic paradoxes of
quantum contextuality as first demonstrated by Kochen and Specker theorem.
  In this contribution we use the consistent histories to describe a
macroscopic (semi-classical) system to show that paradoxes involving
contextuality (mixing different consistent sets) persist even in the
semi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of
standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in
the semi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets
for the arrival time of a semi-classical wave packet in an infinite square
well. Surprisingly, we get consistent sets that disagree on whether the motion
of the semi-classical system, that started within a subregion, ever left that
subregion or not. Our results point to the need for constraints, additional to
the consistency condition, to recover the correct semi-classical limit in this
formalism and lead to the motto `all consistent sets are equal', but `some
consistent sets are more equal than others'.

raw graph information remaining locally. FedWalk is designed to offer
centralized competitive graph representation capability with data privacy
protection and great communication efficiency. FedWalk instantiates the

hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) constructor to extract the structural

structural heterogeneity across different nodes. Based on the constructed HCT,
we then design a random walk generator, wherein a sequence encoder is designed
to preserve privacy and a two-hop neighbor predictor is designed to save
communication cost. The generated random walks are then used to update node
embedding based on a SkipGram model. Extensive experiments on two large graphs
demonstrate that Fed-Walk achieves competitive representativeness as a

This work aimed at evaluating the performances of the MRIQC pipeline on various

for both training and evaluation purposes. We focused our analysis on the MRIQC
preprocessing steps and tested the pipeline with and without them. We further
analyzed the site-wise and study-wise predicted classification probability

without preprocessing yielded the best results when trained and evaluated on
large multi-center datasets with a heterogeneous population (an improvement of
the ROC-AUC score on unseen data of 0.10 for the model trained on a subset of

generating two-dimensional (2D) change maps, thus only identifying planimetric
changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and not considering nor returning any
information on the corresponding elevation changes. Our work goes one step
further, proposing two novel networks, able to solve simultaneously the 2D and
3D CD tasks, and the 3DCD dataset, a novel and freely available dataset
precisely designed for this multitask. Particularly, the aim of this work is to
lay the foundations for the development of DL algorithms able to automatically
infer an elevation (3D) CD map -- together with a standard 2D CD map --,
starting only from a pair of bitemporal optical images. The proposed
architectures, to perform the task described before, consist of a
transformer-based network, the MultiTask Bitemporal Images Transformer (MTBIT),
and a deep convolutional network, the Siamese ResUNet (SUNet). Particularly,
MTBIT is a transformer-based architecture, based on a semantic tokenizer. SUNet
instead combines, in a siamese encoder, skip connections and residual layers to
learn rich features, capable to solve efficiently the proposed task. These
models are, thus, able to obtain 3D CD maps from two optical images taken at
different time instants, without the need to rely directly on elevation data
during the inference step. Encouraging results, obtained on the novel 3DCD
dataset, are shown. The code and the 3DCD dataset are available at

tuberculosis (Mtb.) that produces pulmonary damage due to its airborne nature.
This fact facilitates the disease fast-spreading, which, according to the World
Health Organization (WHO), in 2021 caused 1.2 million deaths and 9.9 million
new cases. Fortunately, X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) images enable capturing
specific manifestations of TB that are undetectable using regular diagnostic
tests.
  However, this procedure is unfeasible to process the thousands of volume
images belonging to the different TB animal models and humans required for a
suitable (pre-)clinical trial. To achieve suitable results, automatization of
different image analysis processes is a must to quantify TB. Thus, in this
thesis, we introduce a set of novel methods based on the state of the art
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV). Initially, we present an
algorithm to assess Pathological Lung Segmentation (PLS). Next, a Gaussian
Mixture Model ruled by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed
to automatically.
  Chapter 3 introduces a model to automate the identification of TB lesions and
the characterization of disease progression.
  Chapter 4 extends the classification of TB lesions. Namely, we introduce a
computational model to infer TB manifestations present in each lung lobe of CT
scans by employing the associated radiologist reports as ground truth. In
Chapter 5, we present a DL model capable of extracting disentangled information
from images of different animal models, as well as information of the
mechanisms that generate the CT volumes.
  To sum up, the thesis presents a collection of valuable tools to automate the
quantification of pathological lungs. Chapter 6 elaborates on these
conclusions.

challenge for bipartite graphs is how to learn informative node embeddings.
Despite the success of recent self-supervised learning methods on bipartite
graphs, their objectives are discriminating instance-wise positive and negative
node pairs, which could contain cluster-level errors. In this paper, we
introduce a novel co-cluster infomax (COIN) framework, which captures the
cluster-level information by maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters.
Different from previous infomax methods which estimate mutual information by
neural networks, COIN could easily calculate mutual information. Besides, COIN
is an end-to-end coclustering method which can be trained jointly with other
objective functions and optimized via back-propagation. Furthermore, we also
provide theoretical analysis for COIN. We theoretically prove that COIN is able
to effectively increase the mutual information of node embeddings and COIN is
upper-bounded by the prior distributions of nodes. We extensively evaluate the
proposed COIN framework on various benchmark datasets and tasks to demonstrate
the effectiveness of COIN.

inadequate services and infrastructures or imbalanced development levels of

Prior transfer learning methods inspire an elegant solution to the data
insufficiency, but are only concerned with one kind of insufficiency issue and
fail to give consideration to both sides. In addition, most previous cross-city
transfer methods overlook inter-city data privacy which is a public concern in
practical applications. To address the above challenging problems, we propose a
novel Cross-city Federated Transfer Learning framework (CcFTL) to cope with the
data insufficiency and privacy problems. Concretely, CcFTL transfers the
relational knowledge from multiple rich-data source cities to the target city.
Besides, the model parameters specific to the target task are firstly trained
on the source data and then fine-tuned to the target city by parameter
transfer. With our adaptation of federated training and homomorphic encryption
settings, CcFTL can effectively deal with the data privacy problem among
cities. We take the urban region profiling as an application of smart cities
and evaluate the proposed method with a real-world study. The experiments
demonstrate the notable superiority of our framework over several competitive
state-of-the-art methods.

facilitate further integration of a lightweight attention mechanism to detect
the most predictive image patches. Using data for 24 clinically relevant genes
from four cancer cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (UCEC, BRCA,
GBM and KIRC), we compared AMIML with one popular instance-based model and four
recently published bag-based models (e.g., CHOWDER, HE2RNA, etc.). AMIML
demonstrated excellent robustness, not only outperforming all the five baseline
algorithms in the vast majority of the tested genes (17 out of 24), but also
providing near-best-performance for the other seven genes. Conversely, the
performance of the baseline published algorithms varied across different
cancers/genes. In addition, compared to the published models for genetic
alterations, AMIML provided a significant improvement for predicting a wide
range of genes (e.g., KMT2C, TP53, and SETD2 for KIRC; ERBB2, BRCA1, and BRCA2

method combines the results as extra inputs with historical records
simultaneously, trains the model to capture the implicit performance

introduced to leverage the balance between the investment of simulation
modeling detail and the accuracy boost. The approach is tested over a
three-year period, with hourly measured energy load from an operating

in-depth study, we explore whether social media discussions from the general
public on Bitcoin have predictive power for extreme price movements. A dataset
of 5,000 tweets per day containing the keyword `Bitcoin' was collected from
2015 to 2021. This dataset, called PreBit, is made available online. In our
hybrid model, we use sentence-level FinBERT embeddings, pretrained on financial
lexicons, so as to capture the full contents of the tweets and feed it to the
model in an understandable way. By combining these embeddings with a
Convolutional Neural Network, we built a predictive model for significant

bound states and correlation functions. There are three crucial steps -
recursive equations, positivity constraints, search space. We calculate
recursive equations of many representative quantum mechanics systems, such as
polynomial potential, exponential potential, Yukawa potential and
electromagnetic potential. Two kinds of bootstrap matrices, which are about the
coordinate and coupling of the coordinate with the momentum, and their ability
of constraining equations are displayed. Nextly, we analyze possible questions
in numerical search, including the importance of constraints and step length,
eigen-energy level and the degeneracy of energy. Finally, we try to explain why
the bootstrap work well by analyzing positivity constraints of creation
operator and annihilation operator in harmonic oscillator. This article
summarizes most knowledge of bootstrapping quantum mechanics (QM), and displays
specific bootstrap equations and bootstrap matrices of different QM systems.

begin, let $a \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a > 3$. Next assign the variable $x$ where
for any prime $p_i \leq a$ there must exist some unique $q_i, \alpha_i \in
\mathbb{N}$ satisfying $x = q_i +p_i$ and $\prod_{i = 1}^{\pi(a)}q_i = \prod_{i

to substitute each $q_i = x + p_i$ into the product relationship to produce the
Goldbach Difference Polynomial $\prod_{i = 1}^{\pi(a)}(x + p_i) = (a +

sample. Such methods have been used pervasively in large-scale data analytics,
active learning, and privacy-preserving analysis in recent decades. Instead of
model-based methods, in this paper, we study model-free subsampling methods,
which aim to identify a subsample that is not confined by model assumptions.
Existing model-free subsampling methods are usually built upon clustering
techniques or kernel tricks. Most of these methods suffer from either a large
computational burden or a theoretical weakness. In particular, the theoretical
weakness is that the empirical distribution of the selected subsample may not
necessarily converge to the population distribution. Such computational and
theoretical limitations hinder the broad applicability of model-free
subsampling methods in practice. We propose a novel model-free subsampling
method by utilizing optimal transport techniques. Moreover, we develop an
efficient subsampling algorithm that is adaptive to the unknown probability
density function. Theoretically, we show the selected subsample can be used for
efficient density estimation by deriving the convergence rate for the proposed
subsample kernel density estimator. We also provide the optimal bandwidth for
the proposed estimator. Numerical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method is superior.

Lobachevsky 1834 and Graeffe 1837, have been the main approach to root-finding
for a univariate polynomial p(x) in the 19th century and beyond, but not so
nowadays because these iterations are prone to severe numerical stability
problems. Trying to avoid these problems we have found simple but novel
reduction of the iterations applied for Newton's inverse ratio -p'(x)/p(x) to
approximation of the power sums of the zeros of p(x) and its reverse
polynomial. The resulting polynomial root-finders can be devised and performed
independently of DLG iterations, based on Newton's identities or Cauchy
integrals. In the former case the computation involve a set of leading or
tailing coefficients of an input polynomial. In the latter case we must scale
the variable and increase the arithmetic computational cost to ensure numerical
stability. Nevertheless the cost is still manageable, at least for fast
root-refinement, and the algorithms can be applied to a black box polynomial
p(x)--given by a black box for the evaluation of the ratio p'(x)/p(x) rather
than by its coefficients. This enables important computational benefits,
including efficient recursive as well as concurrent approximation of a set of
zeros of p(x) or even all of its zeros, acceleration where an input polynomial
can be evaluated fast, and extension to approximation of the eigenvalues of a
matrix or a polynomial matrix, being efficient if the matrix can be inverted
fast, e.g., is data sparse. We also recall our recent fast algorithms for
approximation of the root radii, that is, the distances to the roots from the
origin or any complex value to the zeros of p(x), and apply it for fast black
box initialization of polynomial root-finding by means of functional

two architectures: the Miller architecture, which requires the singular-value
decomposition, and an alternative intuitive direct-complex-matrix (DCM)
architecture introduced here, which does not require a priori mathematical
decomposition. As examples, we demonstrate, using system-level simulation
tools, the solutions of integral and differential equations. We then expand the
matrix inverting capabilities of both architectures toward evaluating the
generalized Moore-Penrose matrix inversion. Therefore, we provide evidence that
metadevices can implement generalized matrix inversions and act as the basis
for the gradient descent method for solutions to a wide variety of problems.
Finally, a general upper bound of the solution convergence time reveals the
rich potential that such metadevices can offer for stationary iterative
schemes.

prior FL optimizations tackled the data and system heterogeneity challenges
faced by FL, they assume the two are independent of each other. This
fundamental assumption is not reflective of real-world, large-scale recommender
systems -- data and system heterogeneity are tightly intertwined. This paper
takes a data-driven approach to show the inter-dependence of data and system
heterogeneity in real-world data and quantifies its impact on the overall model
quality and fairness. We design a framework, RF^2, to model the
inter-dependence and evaluate its impact on state-of-the-art model optimization
techniques for federated recommendation tasks. We demonstrate that the impact
on fairness can be severe under realistic heterogeneity scenarios, by up to
15.8--41x compared to a simple setup assumed in most (if not all) prior work.
It means when realistic system-induced data heterogeneity is not properly
modeled, the fairness impact of an optimization can be downplayed by up to 41x.
The result shows that modeling realistic system-induced data heterogeneity is
essential to achieving fair federated recommendation learning. We plan to
open-source RF^2 to enable future design and evaluation of FL innovations.

connector has been designed and developed to connect an Ethereum-like
blockchain with the enterprises' information systems to allow companies to
share information with their partners with different levels of visibility and
to check data authenticity, integrity and invariability over time through the
blockchain, thus building trust. In order to explore the potential of deploying
the blockchain in a supply chain, a simulation model has been developed to
recreate the supply chain operations and integrated with the blockchain through
the same software connector to carry out a scenario statistical analysis.
Application results shows how blockchain technology is a convenient instrument
to overcome collaboration and trust issues in a supply chain, to increase the
supply chain overall performance, to minimize the negative consequences of
information asymmetry over the echelons of a supply chain but also to
discourage companies from any misconduct (e.g. counterfeiting data or low data
accuracy).

(cyber/control) component is tightly integrated with a physical system (with
sensing/actuation) to enable real-time monitoring and control. Recently, there
has been significant research effort in viewing and optimizing physical
infrastructure in built environments as CPS, even if the control action is not
in real-time. Some examples of infrastructure CPS include electrical power
grids; water distribution networks; transportation and logistics networks;
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) in buildings; etc. Complexity
arises in infrastructure CPS from the large scale of operations; heterogeneity
of system components; dynamic and uncertain operating conditions; and
goal-driven decision making and control with time-bounded task completion
guarantees. For control optimization, an infrastructure CPS is typically viewed
as a system of semi-autonomous sub-systems with a network of sensors and uses
distributed control optimization to achieve system-wide objectives that are
typically measured and quantified by better, cheaper, or faster system
performance. In this article, we first illustrate the scope for control
optimization in common infrastructure CPS. Next, we present a brief overview of
current optimization techniques. Finally, we share our research position with a
description of specific optimization approaches and their challenges for
infrastructure CPS of the future.

to support multiple hardware architectures from the same code base. At the same
time, portability of code and performance are increasingly difficult to achieve
as hardware architectures are becoming more and more diverse. Today's
heterogeneous systems often include two or more completely distinct and
incompatible hardware execution models, such as GPGPU's, SIMD vector units, and
general purpose cores which conventionally have to be programmed using separate
tool chains representing non-overlapping programming models. The recent revival
of interest in the industry and the wider community for the C++ language has
spurred a remarkable amount of standardization proposals and technical
specifications in the arena of concurrency and parallelism. This recently
includes an increasing amount of discussion around the need for a uniform,
higher-level abstraction and programming model for parallelism in the C++
standard targeting heterogeneous and distributed computing. Such an abstraction
should perfectly blend with existing, already standardized language and library
features, but should also be generic enough to support future hardware
developments. In this paper, we present the results from developing such a
higher-level programming abstraction for parallelism in C++ which aims at
enabling code and performance portability over a wide range of architectures
and for various types of parallelism. We present and compare performance data
obtained from running the well-known STREAM benchmark ported to our higher
level C++ abstraction with the corresponding results from running it natively.
We show that our abstractions enable performance at least as good as the
comparable base-line benchmarks while providing a uniform programming API on
all compared target architectures.

applications and, even more, in how widespread the use of the technology is.
Virtually all optical devices involving light beams or with imaging
capabilities available on the market contain thin film assemblies that are
crucial for enhancing the practical performances of the device. So, nowadays,
thin film coatings are routinely deposited on very different kinds of
substrates. From the beginning, the use of thin films required the optical
characterization of the coating materials as well as the design of the suitable
thin film structures in order to meet the optical requirements. This has been a
significant research topic in the past but the impact of high level programming
languages has dramatically changed the scenario. Nowadays, to address the more
advanced computation tasks related to thin film technology is much simple. The
aim of the Tutorial presented here is to enable the reader (with only a basic
knowledge of the use of Matlab or Python) to perform advanced numerical
computations of the optical properties of thin film structures. We will explain
the necessary steps and supply the corresponding program codes, with complete
comments. For conciseness, our short theoretical introduction will follow the
scheme established elsewhere and we will concentrate on developing in detail
several practical examples of increasing difficulty, so that understanding and

localization estimation biases. Interestingly, LOS and NLOS transmissions
affect the polarization of the received signals differently. In this work, we
leverage this phenomenon to propose a threshold-based LOS/NLOS classifier
exploiting weighted differential carrier phase measurements over a single link
with different polarization configurations. Operation in either full or limited
polarization diversity systems is possible. We develop a framework for
assessing the performance of the proposed classifier, and show through
simulations the performance impact of the reflecting materials in NLOS
scenarios. For instance, the classifier is far more efficient in NLOS scenarios
with wooden reflectors than in those with metallic reflectors. Numerical
results evince the potential performance gains from exploiting full
polarization diversity, properly weighting the differential carrier phase
measurements, and using multi-carrier/tone transmissions. Finally, we show that
the optimum decision threshold is inversely proportional to the path power gain
in dB, while it does not depend significantly on the material of potential NLOS

novel methods for solving a system of linear algebraic equations with a time

form using well known optimization techniques. The simplest of these is the
steepest descent method, whose approach to the solution is usually quite rapid
at the beginning but slows down drastically after a few iterations. This paper
investigates possible approaches which can reduce or avoid this slowing down.
The two approaches used here involve random movement of the point between
iterations, and possible matrix transformations between iterations. This paper
reports the results of computational experiments and shows the remarkable
improvement in performance of the steepest descent method that is possible. The
approaches described here do not give a practical algorithm right away.

augmentations for contrastive self-supervised learning of electrocardiogram
(ECG) signals and identifies the best parameters. The baseline of our proposed
self-supervised framework consists of two main parts: the contrastive learning
and the downstream task. In the first stage, we train an encoder using a number
of augmentations to extract generalizable ECG signal representations. We then
freeze the encoder and finetune a few linear layers with different amounts of
labelled data for downstream arrhythmia detection. We then experiment with
various augmentations techniques and explore a range of parameters. Our
experiments are done on PTB-XL, a large and publicly available 12-lead ECG
dataset. The results show that applying augmentations in a specific range of
complexities works better for self-supervised contrastive learning. For
instance, when adding Gaussian noise, a sigma in the range of 0.1 to 0.2
achieves better results, while poor training occurs when the added noise is too
small or too large (outside of the specified range). A similar trend is
observed with other augmentations, demonstrating the importance of selecting
the optimum level of difficulty for the added augmentations, as augmentations
that are too simple will not result in effective training, while augmentations
that are too difficult will also prevent the model from effective learning of
generalized representations. Our work can influence future research on
self-supervised contrastive learning on bio-signals and aid in selecting
optimum parameters for different augmentations.

four benchmark problems we use the population data generated by a Genetic

after being trained on population data generated after the first generation and
contrast this with a surrogate model trained on the population data from all
generations. We show that the surrogate model picks out key characteristics of
the problem as it is trained on population data from each generation. Through
mining the surrogate model we can build a picture of the learning process of a

direction on the position of the center of rotation (CRot). The finite-element
(FE) models of human mandibles from three patients are used to investigate the
position of the CRots for different patients' teeth in 3D space. The CRot is
considered a single point in a 3D coordinate system and is obtained by choosing
the closest point on the axis of rotation to the center of resistance (CRes). A
force system, consisting of a constant load and a couple (pair of forces), is
applied to each tooth, and the corresponding CRot trajectories are examined
across different patients. To perform a consistent inter-patient analysis,
different patients' teeth are registered to the corresponding reference teeth
using an affine transformation. The selected directions and applied points of
force on the reference teeth are then transformed into the registered teeth
domains. The effect of the direction of the couple on the location of the CRot
is also studied by rotating the couples about the three principal axes of a
patient's premolar. Our results indicate that similar patterns can be obtained
for the CRot positions of different patients and teeth if the same load
conditions are used. Moreover, equally rotating the direction of the couple
about the three principal axes results in different patterns for the CRot
positions, especially in labiolingual direction. The CRot trajectories follow
similar patterns in the corresponding teeth, but any changes in the direction
of the force and couple cause misalignment of the CRot trajectories, seen as
rotations about the long axis of the tooth.
