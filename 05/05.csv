method that can be used for constraining the parameters and theoretical models
of Cosmology. Unlike the MCMC technique, which is essentially a non-parallel
algorithm by design, the newly proposed algorithm is able to obtain the full
potential of multi-core machines. With this algorithm, we could obtain the
best-fit parameters of the Lambda CDM cosmological model and identify the
discrepancy in the Hubble parameter $H_0$. In the present work we discuss the
design principle of this novel approach and also the results from the analysis
of Pantheon, OHD and Planck datasets are reported here. The estimation of
parameters shows significant consistency with the previously reported values as
well as a higher computational performance compared to the other similar
exercises.

compare the performance of tanks with different size, configuration of PMTs,

self-attention modules to better learn subtle feature embeddings for
recognizing fine-grained objects, e.g., different bird species or person

algorithm to coordinate with self-attention learning. First, we propose
global-local cross-attention (GLCA) to enhance the interactions between global
images and local high-response regions, which can help reinforce the
spatial-wise discriminative clues for recognition. Second, we propose pair-wise
cross-attention (PWCA) to establish the interactions between image pairs. PWCA
can regularize the attention learning of an image by treating another image as
distractor and will be removed during inference. We observe that DCAL can
reduce misleading attentions and diffuse the attention response to discover
more complementary parts for recognition. We conduct extensive evaluations on
fine-grained visual categorization and object re-identification. Experiments
demonstrate that DCAL performs on par with state-of-the-art methods and
consistently improves multiple self-attention baselines, e.g., surpassing

matter in our Universe. This paper critically assesses whether planned and
future gravitational wave detectors in the ultra-high-frequency band could
constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of sub-solar primordial black
holes. Adopting the state-of-the-art description of primordial black hole
merger rates, we compare various signals with currently operating and planned
detectors. As already noted in the literature, our findings confirm that
detecting individual primordial black hole mergers with currently existing and
operating proposals remains difficult. Current proposals involving
gravitational wave to electromagnetic wave conversion in a static magnetic
field and microwave cavities feature a technology gap with respect to the
loudest gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes of various
orders of magnitude. However, we point out that one recent proposal involving
resonant LC circuits represents the best option in terms of individual merger
detection prospects in the range $(1\div 100) \, \text{MHz}$. In the same
frequency range, we note that alternative setups involving resonant cavities,
whose concept is currently under development, might represent a promising
technology to detect individual merger events. We also show that a detection of
the stochastic gravitational wave background produced by unresolved binaries is
possible only if the theoretical sensitivity of the proposed Gaussian beam
detector is achieved. Such a detector, whose feasibility is subject to various
caveats, may be able to rule-out some scenarios for asteroidal mass primordial
black hole dark matter. We conclude that pursuing dedicated studies and
developments of gravitational wave detectors in the ultra-high-frequency band

rank $2n$. We recently introduced the weakened (globally framed) $f$-structure

allow us to take a fresh look at the classical theory. We demonstrate this by
generalizing several known results on globally framed $f$-manifolds. First, we
express the covariant derivative of $f$ using a new tensor on a metric weak
$f$-structure, then we prove that on a weak $K$-manifold the characteristic
vector fields are Killing and $\ker f$ defines a totally geodesic foliation, an
${\cal S}$-structure is rigid, i.e., our weak ${\cal S}$-structure is an ${\cal

We confirm previous results that cluster stars are found out to ~ 1deg from the
cluster's centre, which is nearly three times the value of the most robust
tidal radii estimations. We also used results from direct N-body simulations in
order to compare with the observations. We found a fairly good agreement

Because of the existence of gaps and substructures along globular cluster tidal
tails, we closely examined the structure of the outer cluster region beyond the
Jacobi radius. We extended the analysis to a sample of 35 globular clusters, 20
of them with observed tidal tails. We found that if the stellar density profile
follows a power law ~ r**(-alpha), the alpha slope correlates with the globular
cluster present mass, in the sense that, the more massive the globular cluster
the smaller the alpha value. This trend is not found in globular clusters
without observed tidal tails. The origin of such a phenomenon could be related,

formation of globular clusters within dark matter mini-haloes.

correlations decay in a powerlaw fashion. We study the fate of
quasi-condensation in the non-equilibrium steady-state of a chain of hard-core
bosons coupled to macroscopic leads which are held at different chemical
potentials. It is found that a finite bias destroys the quasi-condensed state
and the critical scaling function of the quasi-condensed fraction, near the
zero bias transition, is determined. Associated critical exponents are
determined and numerically verified. Away from equilibrium, the system exhibits
exponentially decaying correlations that are characterized by a bias-dependent
correlation length that diverges in equilibrium. In addition, power-law
corrections are found, which are characterized by an exponent that depends on
the chain-leads coupling and is non-analytic at zero bias. This
exactly-solvable nonequilibrium strongly-interacting system has the remarkable
property that, the near-equilibrium state at infinitesimal bias, cannot be
obtained within linear response. These results aid in unraveling the intricate
properties spawned by strong interactions once liberated from equilibrium
constraints.

retrieval, has recently been applied to the problem of ligand-based virtual
screening, to accelerate the early stages of new drug development. Ranking
prediction models learn based on ordinal relationships, making them suitable
for integrating assay data from various environments. Existing studies of rank
prediction in compound screening have generally used a learning-to-rank method
called RankSVM. However, they have not been compared with or validated against
the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based learning-to-rank methods that
have gained popularity recently. Furthermore, although the ranking metric
called Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is widely used in
information retrieval, it only determines whether the predictions are better
than those of other models. In other words, NDCG is incapable of recognizing
when a prediction model produces worse than random results. Nevertheless, NDCG
is still used in the performance evaluation of compound screening using
learning-to-rank. This study used the GBDT model with ranking loss functions,
called lambdarank and lambdaloss, for ligand-based virtual screening; results
were compared with existing RankSVM methods and GBDT models using regression.
We also proposed a new ranking metric, Normalized Enrichment Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NEDCG), which aims to properly evaluate the goodness of
ranking predictions. Results showed that the GBDT model with learning-to-rank
outperformed existing regression methods using GBDT and RankSVM on diverse
datasets. Moreover, NEDCG showed that predictions by regression were comparable
to random predictions in multi-assay, multi-family datasets, demonstrating its
usefulness for a more direct assessment of compound screening performance.

of generic texts, then fine-tuned on tens or hundreds of thousands of annotated
samples. However, in opinion summarization, large annotated datasets of reviews
paired with reference summaries are not available and would be expensive to
create. This calls for fine-tuning methods robust to overfitting on small
datasets. In addition, generically pre-trained models are often not accustomed
to the specifics of customer reviews and, after fine-tuning, yield summaries
with disfluencies and semantic mistakes. To address these problems, we utilize
an efficient few-shot method based on adapters which, as we show, can easily
store in-domain knowledge. Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, we add
adapters and pre-train them in a task-specific way on a large corpus of
unannotated customer reviews, using held-out reviews as pseudo summaries. Then,
fine-tune the adapters on the small available human-annotated dataset. We show
that this self-supervised adapter pre-training improves summary quality over
standard fine-tuning by 2.0 and 1.3 ROUGE-L points on the Amazon and Yelp
datasets, respectively. Finally, for summary personalization, we condition on
aspect keyword queries, automatically created from generic datasets. In the
same vein, we pre-train the adapters in a query-based manner on customer
reviews and then fine-tune them on annotated datasets. This results in
better-organized summary content reflected in improved coherence and fewer
redundancies.

bright optical flare during MJD 59063.5$-$MJD 59120.5. We also found the source
in its brightest ($R_{mag}$= 13.617) and faintest ($R_{mag}$= 15.888) states

searched for the intraday variability using the power-enhanced $F-$test and the
nested ANOVA test. We found significant variability in 2 out of these 13
nights. However, no such variability was detected during the flaring period.
From the correlation analysis, we observed that the emission in all optical
bands were strongly correlated with a time lag of $\sim$ 0 days. To get
insights into its dominant emission mechanisms, we generated the optical
spectral energy distributions of the source on 79 nights and estimated the
spectral indices by fitting the simple power law. Spectral index varied from
1.392 to 1.911 and showed significant variations with time and $R-$band
magnitude. We have detected a mild bluer-when-brighter trend (BWB) during the
whole monitoring period while a much stronger BWB trend during the flare. We
also carried out a periodicity search using four different methods and found no
significant periodicity during our observation duration. Based on the analysis
during the flaring state of the source one can say that the emissions most
likely originate from the jet rather than the accretion disk.

  In a recent paper, C. Mure\c{s}an and the author have proven the existence of

  The present paper aims to give an answer to two types of problems:
  $(I)$ how some properties of the algebra $A$ can be transferred to the
lattice $L(A)$ and viceversa, how some properties of $L(A)$ can be transferred
to $A$;
  $(II)$ how the transfer properties from $(I)$ can be used to prove some old

  We study the transfer properties related to Boolean centers, annihilators,
patch and flat topologies of spectra, Pierce spectrum, pure and $w$ - pure
congruences, the operators $Ker(\cdot)$ and $O(\cdot)$,etc.
  By using these transfer properties, we obtain characterization theorems for
several types of algebras : hyperarchimedean algebras, congruence normal and

that can result from the combination of free-free processes and synchrotron
emission, to explore the conditions for non-thermal SEDs. Simplifying
assumptions are adopted in terms of scaling relations for the magnetic field

suppression on the synchrotron emission. Under these conditions,
long-wavelength SEDs with synchrotron emission can be either more steep or more
shallow than the canonical asymptotic power-law SED from a non-magnetic wind.
When non-thermal emission is present, the resultant SED shape is generally not
a power-law; however, the variation in slope can change slowly with wavelength.
Consequently, over a limited range of wavelengths, the SED can masquerade as
approximately a power law. While most observed non-thermal long-wavelength

influence on single-star SEDs, requiring finer levels of wavelength sampling

  from a binary neutron star merger","37 pages, 14 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The milestone of GW 170817-GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo has shown that
gravitational wave (GW) is produced during the merger of neutron star-neutron
star/black hole and that in electromagnetic (EM) wave a gamma-ray burst (GRB)
and a kilonovae (KN) are generated in sequence after the merger.
Observationally, however, EM property during a merger is still unclear. Here we
report a peculiar precursor in a KN-associated long GRB 211211A. The duration
of the precursor is $\sim$ 0.2 s, and the waiting time between the precursor
and the main emission (ME) of the burst is $\sim$ 1 s, which is about the same
as the time interval between GW 170817 and GRB 170817A. Quasi-Periodic
Oscillations (QPO) with frequency $\sim$22 Hz (at $>5\sigma$ significance) are
found throughout the precursor, the first detection of periodic signals from
any {\it bona fide} GRBs. This indicates most likely that a magnetar
participated in the merger, and the precursor might be produced due to a
catastrophic flare accompanying with torsional or crustal oscillations of the
magnetar. The strong seed magnetic field of $\sim 10^{14-15}$ G at the surface
of the magnetar may also account for the prolonged duration of GRB 211211A.
However, it is a challenge to reconcile the rather short lifetime of a magnetar
\cite{kaspi2017magnetars} with the rather long spiraling time of a binary
neutron star system only by gravitational wave radiation before merger.

computation-intensive and timecritical applications in future Internet of
Things (IoT) era. However, the uplink transmission performance will be highly
impacted by the hostile wireless channel, the low bandwidth, and the low
transmission power of IoT devices. Recently, intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS) has drawn much attention because of its capability to control the
wireless environments so as to enhance the spectrum and energy efficiencies of
wireless communications. In this paper, we consider an IRS-aided multidevice
MEC system where each IoT device follows the binary offloading policy, i.e., a
task has to be computed as a whole either locally or remotely at the edge
server. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of devices by jointly
optimizing the binary offloading modes, the CPU frequencies, the offloading
powers, the offloading times and the IRS phase shifts for all devices. Two
algorithms, which are greedy-based and penalty-based, are proposed to solve the
challenging nonconvex and discontinuous problem. It is found that the
penalty-based method has only linear complexity with respect to the number of
devices, but it performs close to the greedy-based method with cubic complexity
with respect to number of devices. Furthermore, binary offloading via IRS
indeed saves more energy compared to the case without IRS.

in particle physics and cosmology, not only for its implications for a
fundamental theory of mass generation in nature, but also for its decisive role
in the scale of future neutrinoless double beta decay experimental searches. It
has been recently claimed that current oscillation, beta decay and cosmological
limits on the different observables describing the neutrino mass parameter
space provide robust decisive Bayesian evidence in favor of the normal ordering
of the neutrino mass spectrum [arXiv:2203.14247]. We further investigate these
strong claims using a rich and wide phenomenology, with different sampling
techniques of the neutrino parameter space. Contrary to the findings of Jimenez
et al [arXiv:2203.14247], no decisive evidence for the normal mass ordering is
found. Neutrino mass ordering analyses must rely on priors and
parameterizations that are ordering-agnostic: robust results should be regarded
as those in which the preference for the normal neutrino mass ordering is
driven exclusively by the data, while we find a difference of up to a factor of
33 in the Bayes factors among the different priors and parameterizations
exploited here. An ordering-agnostic prior would be represented by the case of
parameterizations sampling over the two mass splittings and a mass scale, or
those sampling over the individual neutrino masses via normal prior
distributions only. In this regard, we show that the current significance in
favor of the normal mass ordering should be taken as $2.7\sigma$ (i.e. moderate
evidence), mostly driven by neutrino oscillation data.

applications. An important benefit of panel analysis is the possibility to
reduce noise and thus to guarantee stable inference by intersectional pooling.
However, it is wellknown that pooling can lead to a biased analysis if
individual heterogeneity is too strong. In classical linear panel models, this
trade-off concerns the homogeneity of slope parameters, and a large body of
tests has been developed to validate this assumption. Yet, such tests can
detect inconsiderable deviations from slope homogeneity, discouraging pooling,
even when practically beneficial. In order to permit a more pragmatic analysis,
which allows pooling when individual heterogeneity is sufficiently small, we
present in this paper the concept of approximate slope homogeneity. We develop
an asymptotic level $\alpha$ test for this hypothesis, that is uniformly
consistent against classes of local alternatives. In contrast to existing
methods, which focus on exact slope homogeneity and are usually sensitive to
dependence in the data, the proposed test statistic is (asymptotically) pivotal
and applicable under simultaneous intersectional and temporal dependence.
Moreover, it can accommodate the realistic case of panels with large
intersections. A simulation study and a data example underline the usefulness
of our approach.

thus modify the penguin diagrams governing the $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$
transitions. Therefore, the $W$-boson mass shift could be related to the $b \to
s \ell^+ \ell^-$ anomalies observed by the LHCb collaboration during the past
few years. To investigate this possibility, we consider in this paper a model
containing a vector-like top partner gauged under a new $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry.
It is found that the latest CDF $m_W$ measurement and the $b \to s \ell^+
\ell^-$ anomalies can be simultaneously accommodated at $2\sigma$ level.

graph-theoretic work for representation, exploration, and analysis of computed
states of physical systems (Banerjee et al., Comp. Meth. App. Mech. Eng., 351,
501-530, 2019). We extend a non-local calculus on finite weighted graphs to
build such models by exploiting polynomial expansions and Taylor series. In the
general framework for non-local calculus on graphs, the graph edge weights are
intricately linked to the embedding of the graph, and consequently to the
definition of the derivatives. In a previous communication (Duschenes and
Garikipati, arXiv:2105.01740), we have shown that radially symmetric,
continuous edge weights derived from, for example Gaussian functions, yield
inconsistent results in the resulting non-local derivatives when compared
against the corresponding local, differential derivative definitions. Taking
inspiration from finite difference methods, we algorithmically compute edge
weights, considering the embedding of the local neighborhood of each graph
vertex. Given this procedure, we ensure the consistency of the non-local
derivatives in this setting, a crucial requirement for numerical applications.
We show that we can achieve any desired orders of accuracy of derivatives, in a
chosen number of dimensions without symmetry assumptions in the underlying
data. Finally, we present two example applications of extracting reduced-order
models using this non-local calculus, in the form of ordinary differential
equations from parabolic partial differential equations of progressively
greater complexity.

be far lower than prescriptions typically employed in single-star evolutionary
models. Importantly, RSG winds are too weak to drive the production of
Wolf-Rayets (WRs) and stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) at initial masses
of roughly 20--40$M_{\odot}$. If single-stars are to make WRs and SE-SNe, this
shifts the burden of mass-loss to rare dust-enshrouded RSGs (DE-RSGs), objects
claimed to represent a short-lived high mass-loss phase. Here, we take a fresh
look at the purported DE-RSGs. By modeling the mid-IR excesses of the full
sample of RSGs in the LMC, we find that only one RSG has both a high mass-loss
rate (\mdot $\ge$ 10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and a high optical
circumstellar dust extinction (7.92 mag). This one RSG is WOH G64, and it is
the only one of the 14 originally proposed DE-RSGs that is actually dust
enshrouded. The rest appear to be either normal RSGs without strong
infrared-excess, or lower-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Only one
additional object in the full catalog of RSGs (not previously identified as a
DE-RSG) shows strong mid-IR excess. We conclude that if DE-RSGs do represent a
pre-SN phase of enhanced \mdot\ in single-stars, it is extremely short-lived,
only capable of removing $\leq$2\msun\ of material. This rules out the
single-star post-RSG pathway for the production of WRs, LBVs, and SE-SN.
Single-star models should not employ \mdot-prescriptions based on these extreme
objects for any significant fraction of the RSG phase.

that the weaknesses can be exploited. To discuss our claim and rise the
developers' awareness of the vulnerability of the self-admitted technical debt

first mine the Common Weakness Enumeration repository to define heuristics for

the heuristics to find weak code snippets associated to self-admitted technical

when the data has noisy labels. Even the semi-supervised classification
approaches have largely focused only on the problem of handling missing labels.
Most of the approaches addressing the noisy label data rely on deep neural
networks (DNN) that require huge datasets for classification tasks. This poses
a serious challenge especially in process and manufacturing industries, where
the data is limited and labels are noisy. We propose a semi-supervised cascaded
clustering (SSCC) algorithm to extract patterns and generate a cascaded tree of
classes in such datasets. A novel cluster evaluation matrix (CEM) with
configurable hyperparameters is introduced to localize and eliminate the noisy
labels and invoke a pruning criterion on cascaded clustering. The algorithm
reduces the dependency on expensive human expertise for assessing the accuracy
of labels. A classifier generated based on SSCC is found to be accurate and
consistent even when trained on noisy label datasets. It performed better in
comparison with the support vector machines (SVM) when tested on multiple
noisy-label datasets, including an industrial dataset. The proposed approach
can be effectively used for deriving actionable insights in industrial settings
with minimal human expertise.

terms of $2 \times 2$ transfer matrices. We find that these non-Hermitian

two zero temperature baths at two ends, this consequently leads to subdiffusive
scaling of conductance with system size, with an exponent $2$, if the chemical
potential of the baths are equal to the band edges. We further demonstrate the
existence of a dissipative quantum phase transition as the chemical potential
is tuned across any band edge. Remarkably, this feature is analogous to
transition across a mobility edge in quasiperiodic systems. This behavior is
universal, irrespective of the details of the periodic potential and the number

network theory, this work studies the extremal gain of optimal power control
over binary (on/off) power control, especially in large interference networks,
in search of new theoretical insights. Whereas numerical studies have already
established that in most practical settings binary power control is close to
optimal, the extremal analysis shows not only that there exist settings where
the gain from optimal power control can be quite significant, but also bounds
the extremal values of such gains from a GDoF perspective. As its main
contribution, this work explicitly characterizes the extremal GDoF gain of
optimal over binary power control as $\Theta\left(\sqrt{K}\right)$ for all $K$.
In particular, the extremal gain is bounded between $\lfloor \sqrt{K}\rfloor$
and $2.5\sqrt{K}$ for every $K$. For $K=2,3,4,5,6$ users, the precise extremal
gain is found to be $1, 3/2, 2, 9/4$ and $41/16$, respectively. Networks shown
to achieve the extremal gain may be interpreted as multi-tier heterogeneous
networks. It is worthwhile to note that because of their focus on asymptotic
analysis, the sharp characterizations of extremal gains are valuable primarily
from a theoretical perspective, and not as contradictions to the conventional
wisdom that binary power control is generally close to optimal in practical,
non-asymptotic settings.

  Time in Observational Studies","31 pages main text with 2 figures and 5 tables, plus additional 14
  pages appendix",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Investigating the causal relationship between exposure and the time-to-event
outcome is an important topic in biomedical research. Previous literature has
discussed the potential issues of using the hazard ratio as a marginal causal
effect measure due to its noncollapsibility property. In this paper, we
advocate using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) difference as the
marginal causal effect measure, which is collapsible and has a simple
interpretation as the difference of area under survival curves over a certain
time horizon. To address both measured and unmeasured confounding, a matched
design with sensitivity analysis is proposed. Matching is used to pair similar
treated and untreated subjects together, which is more robust to outcome model
misspecification. Our propensity score matched RMST difference estimator is
shown to be asymptotically unbiased and the corresponding variance estimator is
calculated by accounting for the correlation due to matching. The simulation
study also demonstrates that our method has adequate empirical performance and
outperforms many competing methods used in practice. To assess the impact of
unmeasured confounding, we develop a sensitivity analysis strategy by adapting
the E-value approach to matched data. We apply the proposed method to the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) to examine the causal effect
of smoking on stroke-free survival.

fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by galaxies successfully escapes into

observational data, the sources driving reionization remain uncertain. In this
work we calculate the ionizing escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$) of
reionization-era galaxies from the state-of-the-art THESAN simulations, which
combine an accurate radiation-hydrodynamic solver AREPO-RT with the well-tested
IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model to self-consistently simulate both
small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale reionization throughout a large
patch of the universe ($L_{\rm box} = 95.5\,\rm cMpc$). This allows the
formation of numerous massive haloes ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{10}\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$), which are often statistically underrepresented in previous
studies but are believed to be important to achieve rapid reionization. We find
that low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm stars} \lesssim 10^7\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$) are the
main drivers of reionization above $z \gtrsim 7$, while high-mass galaxies
($M_{\rm stars} \gtrsim 10^8\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$) dominate the escaped ionizing
photon budget at lower redshifts. The variation in halo escape fractions
decreases for higher-mass haloes, which can be understood from the more settled
galactic structure, SFR stability, and fraction of sightlines within each halo
significantly contributing to the escaped flux. We show that dust is capable of
reducing the escape fractions of massive galaxies, but the impact on the global
$f_{\rm esc}$ depends on the dust model. Finally, AGN are unimportant for
reionization in THESAN and their escape fractions are lower than stellar ones
due to being located near the centres of galaxy gravitational potential wells.

understanding differences to the traditionally assumed rare DM (large-angle)

the halo and subhalo mass functions. Furthermore, we investigate the density

particular, the number of satellites is considerably suppressed for frequent
compared to rare self-interactions with the same cross-section. Overall we
observe that while differences between the two cases may be difficult to
establish using a single measure, the degeneracy may be broken through a
combination of multiple ones. For instance, the combination of satellite counts
with halo density or shape profiles could allow discriminating between rare and

tackle this task have been presented during the last years.
  Aims. We present a deep revision of the already existing code ASOHF. The
algorithm has been throughfully redesigned in order to improve its capabilities
to find bound structures and substructures, both using dark matter particles
and stars, its parallel performance, and its abilities to handle simulation
outputs with vast amounts of particles. This upgraded version of ASOHF is
conceived to be a publicly available tool.
  Methods. A battery of idealised and realistic tests are presented in order to
assess the performance of the new version of the halo finder.
  Results. In the idealised tests, ASOHF produces excellent results, being able
to find virtually all the structures and substructures placed within the
computational domain. When applied to realistic data from simulations, the
performance of our finder is fully consistent with the results from other
commonly used halo finders, with remarkable performance in substructure
detection. Besides, ASOHF turns out to be extremely efficient in terms of
computational cost.
  Conclusions. We present a public, deeply revised version of the ASOHF halo
finder. The new version of the code produces remarkable results finding haloes

performance and with a contained computational cost.

tantalizing manifestation of ergodicity breakdown that continues to attract
much attention. Recent works have focused on two classes of such systems:
discrete time crystals and quantum many-body scars (QMBS). While both systems
host oscillatory dynamics, its origin is expected to be fundamentally
different: discrete time crystal is a phase of matter which spontaneously
breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the external periodic drive, while QMBS
span a subspace of non-thermalizing eigenstates forming an su(2) algebra
representation. Here we ask a basic question: is there a physical system that
allows to tune between these two dynamical phenomena? In contrast to much
previous work, we investigate the possibility of a \emph{continuous} time
crystal (CTC) in undriven, energy-conserving systems exhibiting
prethermalization. We introduce a long-range XYZ spin model and show that it
encompasses both a CTC phase as well as QMBS. We map out the dynamical phase
diagram using numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and
time-dependent variational principle in the thermodynamic limit. We identify a
regime where QMBS and CTC order co-exist, and we discuss experimental protocols

kind of quantum complexity as their preparation requires universal resources
that go beyond the Clifford group and stabilizer states. These resources -
sometimes described as magic - are also the crucial ingredient for quantum
advantage. We study the behavior of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in the
integrable transverse field Ising spin chain. We show that the locality of
interactions results in a localized stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in the gapped
phase thus making this quantity computable in terms of local quantities in the
gapped phase, while measurements involving $L$ spins are necessary at the
critical point to obtain an error scaling with $O(L^{-1})$.

the presence of a uniform vertical background magnetic field. ODDC takes place
in stellar regions that are unstable according to the Schwarzschild criterion
and stable according to the Ledoux criterion (sometimes called semiconvective
regions), which are often predicted to reside just outside the core of
intermediate-mass main sequence stars. Previous hydrodynamic studies of ODDC
have shown that the basic instability saturates into a state of weak wave-like
convection, but that a secondary instability can sometimes transform it into a
state of layered convection, where layers then rapidly merge and grow until the
entire region is fully convective. We find that magnetized ODDC has very
similar properties overall, with some important quantitative differences. A
linear stability analysis reveals that the fastest-growing modes are unaffected
by the field, but that other modes are. Numerically, the magnetic field is seen
to influence the saturation of the basic instability, overall reducing the
turbulent fluxes of temperature and composition. This in turn affects layer
formation, usually delaying it, and occasionally suppressing it entirely for
sufficiently strong fields. Further work will be needed, however, to determine
the field strength above which layer formation is actually suppressed in stars.
Potential observational implications are briefly discussed.

detail and characterise it into molecular clouds. In a previous paper, we have
classified the SEDIGISM clouds into four morphologies. However, how the
properties of the clouds vary for these four morphologies is not well
understood. Here, we use the morphological classification of SEDIGISM clouds to
find connections between the cloud morphologies, their integrated properties,
and their location on scaling relation diagrams. We observe that ring-like
clouds show the most peculiar properties, having, on average, higher masses,
sizes, aspect ratios and velocity dispersions compared to other morphologies.
We speculate that this is related to the physical mechanisms that regulate
their formation and evolution, for example, turbulence from stellar feedback
can often results in the creation of bubble-like structures. We also see a
trend of morphology with virial parameter whereby ring-like, elongated, clumpy
and concentrated clouds have virial parameters in a decreasing order. Our
findings provide a foundation for a better understanding of the molecular cloud
behaviour based on their measurable properties.

susceptible to current- and pressure-driven MHD instabilities that can lead to
particle acceleration and non-thermal radiation. Here we investigate the
development of these instabilities through 3D kinetic simulations of
cylindrically symmetric equilibria involving toroidal magnetic fields with
electron-positron pair plasma. Generalizing recent treatments by Alves et al.
(2018) and Davelaar et al. (2020), we consider a range of initial structures in
which the force due to toroidal magnetic field is balanced by a combination of
forces due to axial magnetic field and gas pressure. We argue that the particle
energy limit identified by Alves et al. (2018) is due to the finite duration of
the fast magnetic dissipation phase. We find a rather minor role of electric
fields parallel to the local magnetic fields in particle acceleration. In all
investigated cases a kink mode arises in the central core region with a growth
timescale consistent with the predictions of linearized MHD models. In the case
of a gas-pressure-balanced (Z-pinch) profile, we identify a weak local pinch
mode well outside the jet core. We argue that pressure-driven modes are
important for relativistic jets, in regions where sufficient gas pressure is

in quantum states. Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no
inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the
model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially
for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that
encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work
we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances
in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those
symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain
invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group $\mathfrak{G}$
associated to the dataset. We present theoretical results underpinning the
design of $\mathfrak{G}$-invariant models, and exemplify their application
through several paradigmatic QML classification tasks including cases when
$\mathfrak{G}$ is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete
symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way,
several well known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new
ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards
a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.

applications. Yet, estimating the unknown parameters of stochastic, nonlinear
dynamical models remains a challenging problem. The majority of existing
methods employ maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. However, these
methods suffer from some limitations, most notably the substantial
computational time for inference coupled with limited flexibility in
application. In this work, we propose DeepBayes estimators that leverage the
power of deep recurrent neural networks in learning an estimator. The method
consists of first training a recurrent neural network to minimize the
mean-squared estimation error over a set of synthetically generated data using
models drawn from the model set of interest. The a priori trained estimator can
then be used directly for inference by evaluating the network with the
estimation data. The deep recurrent neural network architectures can be trained
offline and ensure significant time savings during inference. We experiment
with two popular recurrent neural networks -- long short term memory network
(LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). We demonstrate the applicability of our
proposed method on different example models and perform detailed comparisons
with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a study on a real-world
nonlinear benchmark problem. The experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is asymptotically as good as the Bayes estimator.

play an outsized role in physical phenomena. A theoretical understanding of the
behavior of such extreme particles is nascent. A classical model, in the spirit
of Einstein's treatment of single-particle diffusion, has each particle taking
independent homogeneous random walks. This, however, neglects the fact that all
particles diffuse in a common and often inhomogeneous environment that can
affect their motion. A more sophisticated model treats this common environment
as a space-time random biasing field which influences each particle's
independent motion. While the bulk (or typical particle) behavior of these two
models has been found to match to high degree, recent theoretical work of
Barraquand, Corwin and Le Doussal on a one-dimensional exactly solvable version
of this random environment model suggests that the extreme behavior is quite
different between the two models. We transform these asymptotic (in system size
and time) results into physically applicable predictions. Using high precision
numerical simulations we reconcile different asymptotic phases in a manner that
matches numerics down to realistic system sizes, amenable to experimental
confirmation. We characterize the behavior of extreme diffusion in the random
environment model by the presence of a new phase with anomalous fluctuations
related to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class and equation.

the design or operation of their platforms. The workhorse of experimentation is
the randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, in which users are randomly
assigned to treatment or control groups. However, marketplace interference
causes the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) to be violated,
leading to bias in the standard RCT metric. In this work, we propose a
technique for platforms to run standard RCTs and still obtain meaningful
estimates despite the presence of marketplace interference. We specifically
consider a matching setting, in which the platform explicitly matches supply
with demand via a matching algorithm. Our proposed technique is quite simple:
instead of comparing the total value accrued by the treatment and control
groups, we instead compare each group's average shadow price in the matching
linear program. We prove that, in the fluid limit, our proposed technique
corresponds to the correct first-order approximation (in a Taylor series sense)
of the value function of interest. We then use this result to prove that, under
reasonable assumptions, our estimator is less biased than the RCT estimator. At
the heart of our result is the idea that it is relatively easy to model
interference in matching-driven marketplaces since, in such markets, the
platform intermediates the spillover.

clarify if the dearth of planets around more massive stars is real, we launched
the direct-imaging B-star Exoplanet Abundance STudy (BEAST) survey targeting B
stars ($M>2.4~M_\odot$) in the young (5-20 Myr) Scorpius-Centaurus association
(Sco-Cen). Here we present the case of a massive ($M \sim 9~M_\odot$) BEAST
target, $\mu^2$ Sco. Based on kinematic information, we found that $\mu^2$ Sco
is a member of a small group which we label Eastern Lower Scorpius, refining in
turn the precision on stellar parameters. Around this star we identified a
robustly detected substellar companion ($14.4\pm 0.8 M_J$) at a projected
separation of $290\pm 10$ au, and a probable second object ($18.5\pm 1.5 M_J$)
at $21\pm 1$ au. The planet-to-star mass ratios of these objects are similar to
that of Jupiter to the Sun, and their irradiation is similar to those of
Jupiter and Mercury, respectively. The two companions of $\mu^2$ Sco are
naturally added to the giant planet b Cen b recently discovered by BEAST;
although slightly more massive than the deuterium burning limit, their
properties resemble those of giant planets around less massive stars and they
are better reproduced by a formation under a planet-like, rather than a
star-like scenario. Irrespective of the (needed) confirmation of the inner
companion, $\mu^2$ Sco is the first star that would end its life as a supernova
that hosts such a system. The tentative high frequency of BEAST discoveries
shows that giant planets or small-mass brown dwarfs can form around B stars.
When putting this finding in the context of core accretion and gravitational
instability, we conclude that the current modeling of both mechanisms is not
able to produce this kind of companion. BEAST will pave the way for the first
time to an extension of these models to intermediate and massive stars.

attracted considerable attention in many strongly correlated metals. Famous
examples are the nematic order in Fe-based superconductors and the
star-of-David charge density order in kagome metals. Such exotic symmetry
breaking in metals is a central issue of modern condensed matter physics, while
its theoretical foundation is still unclear in comparison with the
well-established theory of superconductivity. To overcome this difficulty, here
we introduce the ""form factor"" that generalizes the nonlocal order parameter
into the Luttinger-Ward (LW) Fermi liquid theory. We then construct a rigorous
formalism of the ""density-wave equation"" that gives the thermodynamically
stable form factor, similarly to the superconducting-gap equation. In addition,
a rigorous expression of the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy for the unconventional
order is presented to calculate various thermodynamic properties. In the next
stage, we apply the derived formalism to a typical Fe-based superconductor
FeSe, by using the one-loop LW function that represents the free-energy gain
due to the interference among paramagnons. The following key experiments are
naturally explained: (i) Lifshitz transition (=disappearance of an
electron-pocket) due to the bond+orbital order below $T_c$. (ii) Curie-Weiss
behavior of the nematic susceptibility at higher T, and the deviation from the
Curie-Weiss behavior at lower T near the nematic quantum-critical-point. (iii)
Scaling relation of the specific heat jump at $T_c$, $\Delta C/T_c \propto
T_c^b$ with $b \sim 3$. (Note that b=0 in the BCS theory.) These results lead
to a conclusion that the nematicity in FeSe is the bond+orbital order due to
the ""paramagnon interference mechanism"". The present theory paves the way for
solving various unconventional phase transition systems.

noncommutative $L_{p}$-spaces. In the first part, we establish the
noncommutative maximal inequalities for Bochner-Riesz means associated with
Hermite operators and then obtain the corresponding pointwise convergence
theorems. In particular, we develop a noncommutative Stein\textquoteright s
theorem of Bochner-Riesz means for the Hermite operators. The second part of
this paper deals with two multiplier theorems for Hermite operators. Our
analysis on this part is based on a noncommutative analogue of the classical
Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory associated with Hermite expansions.

one-dimensional Brownian particle subject to an external potential $v(x)$ in a
finite domain. We focus on the cases in which the external potential is
confining, of the form $v(x)=k|x-x_0|^n/n$, and where the particle's initial
position coincides with $x_0$. We first consider a particle between an
absorbing target at $x=0$ and a reflective wall at $x=c$. At fixed $x_0$, we
show that when the target distance $c$ exceeds a critical value, there exists a
nonzero optimal stiffness $k_{\rm opt}$ that minimizes the MFPT to the target.
However, when $c$ lies below the critical value, the optimal stiffness $k_{\rm
opt}$ vanishes. Hence, for any value of $n$, the optimal potential stiffness
undergoes a continuous ""freezing"" transition as the domain size is varied. On
the other hand, when the reflective wall is replaced by a second absorbing
target, the freezing transition in $k_{\rm opt}$ becomes discontinuous. The
phase diagram in the $(x_0,n)$-plane then exhibits three dynamical phases and
metastability, with a ""triple"" point at $(x_0/c\simeq 0.17185$, $n\simeq
0.39539)$. For harmonic or higher order potentials $(n\ge 2)$, the MFPT always
increases with $k$ at small $k$, for any $x_0$ or domain size. These results
are contrasted with problems of diffusion under optimal resetting in bounded
domains.

quantum computers that promise computational breakthroughs in classically
intractable tasks. Programming quantum computers requires awareness of
entanglement, the phenomenon in which measurement outcomes of qubits are
correlated. Entanglement can determine the correctness of algorithms and
suitability of programming patterns.
  In this work, we formalize purity as a central tool for automating reasoning
about entanglement in quantum programs. A pure expression is one whose
evaluation is unaffected by the measurement outcomes of qubits that it does not
own, implying freedom from entanglement with any other expression in the
computation.
  We present Twist, the first language that features a type system for sound
reasoning about purity. The type system enables the developer to identify pure
expressions using type annotations. Twist also features purity assertion
operators that state the absence of entanglement in the output of quantum
gates. To soundly check these assertions, Twist uses a combination of static
analysis and runtime verification.
  We evaluate Twist's type system and analyses on a benchmark suite of quantum
programs in simulation, demonstrating that Twist can express quantum
algorithms, catch programming errors in them, and support programs that several
languages disallow, while incurring runtime verification overhead of less than
3.5%.

kind of selection on unobservables it allows. Consequently, researchers can
assess the plausibility of any exogeneity assumption by studying the
distributions of treatment given the unobservables that are consistent with
that assumption. We use this approach to study two common exogeneity
assumptions: quantile and mean independence. We show that both assumptions
require a kind of non-monotonic relationship between treatment and the
potential outcomes. We discuss how to assess the plausibility of this kind of
treatment selection. We also show how to define a new and weaker version of
quantile independence that allows for monotonic treatment selection. We then
show the implications of the choice of exogeneity assumption for

formulations. To facilitate a finer control over the resulting tilings, we
extend these programs with tile-based, color-based, packing, and variable-sized

increasing expansion of network attack surfaces and the exponentially growing

introduce a deep learning based approach to Zero Day Threat detection that can
generalize, scale, and effectively identify threats in near real-time. The
methodology utilizes network flow telemetry augmented with asset-level graph
features, which are passed through a dual-autoencoder structure for anomaly and
novelty detection respectively. The models have been trained and tested on four
large scale datasets that are representative of real-world organizational
networks and they produce strong results with high precision and recall values.
The models provide a novel methodology to detect complex threats with low
false-positive rates that allow security operators to avoid alert fatigue while
drastically reducing their mean time to response with near-real-time detection.
Furthermore, the authors also provide a novel, labelled, cyber attack dataset
generated from adversarial activity that can be used for validation or training

passage ranking. The dual-encoder architecture is widely adopted for scoring
question-passage pairs due to its efficiency and high performance. Typically,
dense retrieval models are evaluated on clean and curated datasets. However,
when deployed in real-life applications, these models encounter noisy
user-generated text. That said, the performance of state-of-the-art dense
retrievers can substantially deteriorate when exposed to noisy text. In this
work, we study the robustness of dense retrievers against typos in the user
question. We observe a significant drop in the performance of the dual-encoder
model when encountering typos and explore ways to improve its robustness by
combining data augmentation with contrastive learning. Our experiments on two
large-scale passage ranking and open-domain question answering datasets show
that our proposed approach outperforms competing approaches. Additionally, we
perform a thorough analysis on robustness. Finally, we provide insights on how
different typos affect the robustness of embeddings differently and how our
method alleviates the effect of some typos but not of others.

manifold from high-dimensional data, then employing this quadratic manifold to
derive efficient physics-based reduced-order models. The key ingredient of the
approach is a polynomial mapping between high-dimensional states and a
low-dimensional embedding. This mapping consists of two parts: a representation
in a linear subspace (computed in this work using the proper orthogonal
decomposition) and a quadratic component. The approach can be viewed as a form
of data-driven closure modeling, since the quadratic component introduces
directions into the approximation that lie in the orthogonal complement of the
linear subspace, but without introducing any additional degrees of freedom to
the low-dimensional representation. Combining the quadratic manifold
approximation with the operator inference method for projection-based model
reduction leads to a scalable non-intrusive approach for learning reduced-order
models of dynamical systems. Applying the new approach to transport-dominated
systems of partial differential equations illustrates the gains in efficiency
that can be achieved over approximation in a linear subspace.

language generation, smooth sentence interpolation, and style transfer over
unseen attributes using unlabelled datasets in a zero-shot manner. The latent
space geometry of such models is organised well enough to perform on datasets
where the style is ""coarse-grained"" i.e. a small fraction of words alone in a
sentence are enough to determine the overall style label. A recent study uses a
discrete token-based perturbation approach to map ""similar"" sentences
(""similar"" defined by low Levenshtein distance/ high word overlap) close by in
latent space. This definition of ""similarity"" does not look into the underlying
nuances of the constituent words while mapping latent space neighbourhoods and
therefore fails to recognise sentences with different style-based semantics
while mapping latent neighbourhoods. We introduce EPAAEs (Embedding Perturbed
Adversarial AutoEncoders) which completes this perturbation model, by adding a
finely adjustable noise component on the continuous embeddings space. We
empirically show that this (a) produces a better organised latent space that
clusters stylistically similar sentences together, (b) performs best on a
diverse set of text style transfer tasks than similar denoising-inspired
baselines, and (c) is capable of fine-grained control of Style Transfer
strength. We also extend the text style transfer tasks to NLI datasets and show
that these more complex definitions of style are learned best by EPAAE. To the
best of our knowledge, extending style transfer to NLI tasks has not been
explored before.

we identify a ""cell-dominated hierarchy"" in the network: a key member is not
central, but is connected to a relative with a central position. iii) The
probability of link formation between two agents is higher if the two agents
belong to the same Mandamento, if they share a high number of similar tasks,
while being a ""boss"" reduces the probability of link formation between them.
iv) The probability of link formation for an individual agent is higher if he
is in charge of keeping connections outside his Mandamento, of collecting
protection money and or having a directive role, while age has modest role.
These results are interpreted in the light of the efficiency/security trade-off
faced by the Mafia and of its known hierarchical structure.

simulation algorithms for non-adiabatic dynamics, are typically performed in
the adiabatic representation, which can break down in the presence of
ill-defined adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and adiabatic coupling
term. Another issue of surface hopping algorithms is the difficulty in
capturing the correct scaling of the transition rate in the Marcus
(weak-coupling/non-adiabatic) regime. Though the first issue can be
circumvented by exploiting the diabatic representation, diabatic surface
hopping algorithms usually lack justification on the theoretical level. We
consider the diabatic surface hopping algorithm proposed in [Fang, Lu.
Multiscale Model. Simul. 16:4, 1603-1622, 2018] and provide the asymptotic
analysis of the transition rate in the Marcus regime that justifies the correct
scaling for the spin-boson model. We propose two conditions that guarantee the
correctness for general potentials. In the opposite (strong-coupling/adiabatic)
regime, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm that interestingly
matches a type of mean-field description. The techniques used here may shed
light on the analysis for other diabatic-based algorithms.

forces. In this paper, we propose a model to study situations in which

besides the cost associated with cooperation. The proposed Costly-Access
Prisoner's Dilemma, a symmetric donation game with voluntary and costly
participation, breaks the symmetry between abstainers and participants of the
Voluntary Prisoner's Dilemma. A mean-field approach shows that, in well-mixed
populations, the dynamic always leads the system to abstention. However,
depending on the return parameter, numerical simulations in structured
populations display an alternating behavior between mono-strategic,
multi-stable, and coexistence phases. This behavior is fully explained through
a theoretical analysis of the strategic motifs, the transitions being
determined by the change in stability of those motifs.

evaluation shows that prompting large language models within a weak supervision
framework can provide significant gains in accuracy. On the WRENCH weak

sharp threshold was recently established by Perkins and Xu, and Abbe, Li, and

Hamiltonians. Furthermore, any error in the control fields reduces the fidelity
of the implemented control operation with respect to the ideal target
operation. Achieving sufficiently fast gate operations at low error rates
remains therefore a huge challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach
to overcome this challenge by eliminating, for specific gate operations, the
time-dependent control fields entirely. This approach appears useful for
maximising the speed of the gate operation while simultaneously eliminating
relevant sources of errors. We present an experimental demonstration of the
concept in a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at room
temperature.

bilevel optimization employ first-order sensitivity analysis, based on the
implicit function theorem (IFT), for the lower problem to derive a gradient of
the lower problem solution with respect to its parameters; this IFT gradient is
then used in a first-order optimization method for the upper problem. This
paper extends this sensitivity analysis to provide second-order derivative
information of the lower problem (which we call the IFT Hessian), enabling the
usage of faster-converging second-order optimization methods at the upper

produce the IFT gradient can be reused for the IFT Hessian, (ii) errors bounds
derived for the IFT gradient readily apply to the IFT Hessian, (iii) computing

for VLGs made of any composition. For external alignment, we find that VLGs

by RATs ($B-$RAT) or METs ($B-$ MET), enabling dust polarization as a reliable
tracer of magnetic fields in such dense regions. Still, grains at low$-J$
attractors or grains without iron inclusions have alignment along the radiation
direction ($k-$RAT) or gas flow ($v-$MET). For protostellar disks, we find that
super-Barnett relaxation can be efficient for grains with large iron inclusions

inefficient. VLGs aligned at low-J attractors can have $k-$RAT ($v-$MET)

which aims at obtaining multi-parametric tissue parameter maps from single
short scans. It describes the relationship between the spatial-domain tissue
parameters and the time-domain measured signal by using a comprehensive,
volumetric forward model. The MR-STAT reconstruction solves a large-scale
nonlinear problem, thus is very computationally challenging. In previous work,
MR-STAT reconstruction using Cartesian readout data was accelerated by
approximating the Hessian matrix with sparse, banded blocks, and can be done on
high performance CPU clusters with tens of minutes. In the current work, we
propose an accelerated Cartesian MR-STAT algorithm incorporating two different
strategies: firstly, a neural network is trained as a fast surrogate to learn
the magnetization signal not only in the full time-domain but also in the
compressed lowrank domain; secondly, based on the surrogate model, the
Cartesian MR-STAT problem is re-formulated and split into smaller sub-problems
by the alternating direction method of multipliers. The proposed method
substantially reduces the computational requirements for runtime and memory.
Simulated and in-vivo balanced MR-STAT experiments show similar reconstruction
results using the proposed algorithm compared to the previous sparse Hessian
method, and the reconstruction times are at least 40 times shorter.
Incorporating sensitivity encoding and regularization terms is straightforward,
and allows for better image quality with a negligible increase in
reconstruction time. The proposed algorithm could reconstruct both balanced and
gradient-spoiled in-vivo data within 3 minutes on a desktop PC, and could
thereby facilitate the translation of MR-STAT in clinical settings.

nonreciprocal and near zero-index sound propagation behavior; these properties
can be very beneficial in the design of acoustic devices, including acoustic
diodes, amplifiers, and cloaks. Nevertheless, it is critical to realize that
when this concept is implemented in a finite-length waveguide, dynamic
instabilities may occur and either drastically reduce or completely hinder the
ability of the TAWG to control and manipulate sound. In this work, we uncover
and investigate the occurrence of either evanescent or intrinsic thermoacoustic
(ITA) modes in a 1D TAWG with anechoic terminations. The stability analysis
clearly distinguishes these two types of evanescent modes and highlights their
different origin rooted in either acoustic or thermoviscous effects. Numerical
results reveal that ITA modes in anechoic-terminated TAWG are strictly
connected to the acoustic-driven evanescent modes, and evolve towards unstable
modes as the TA coupling strength is increased. This study may have important
implications for the practical design of novel acoustic manipulating devices
enabled by TA coupling elements. The conclusions drawn in this study may also
shed lights on the effective suppression of instabilities in TAWGs.

linear theory and the first disclosures from 2D PIC simulations, identifying
the fastest growing modes near the instability thresholds and their long-run
consequences on the anisotropic distributions. Thus, unlike previous setups,
these conditions are favorable to those aperiodic branches that propagate
obliquely to the uniform magnetic field, with (maximum) growth rates higher
than periodic, quasi-parallel modes. Theoretical predictions are, in general,
confirmed by the simulations. The aperiodic electron FI (a-EFI) remains
unaffected by the proton anisotropy, and saturates rapidly at low-level

stronger competition between the periodic and aperiodic branches. For the

torques resulting in more complex motions. KODA algorithms enable direct
evaluation of the line-of-sight component of the net torque density from the
image-plane projection of the areal acceleration. The method is applied to the
prominence eruption of 2011 June 7, observed by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Results obtained include
quantitative estimates of the magnetic forces, field intensities, and blob
masses and energies across a vast region impacted by the post-reconnection
redistribution of the prominence material. The magnetic pressure and energy are
strongly dominant during the early, rising phase of the eruption, while the
dynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the
subsequent falling phases. Measured intensive properties of the prominence
blobs are consistent with those of typical active-region prominences; measured
extensive properties are compared with those of the whole pre-eruption
prominence and the post-eruption coronal mass ejection of 2011 June 7, all
derived by other investigators and techniques. We argue that KODA provides
valuable information on characteristics of erupting prominences that are not
readily available via alternative means, thereby shedding new light on their
environment and evolution.

weighted combination of the vote of the first variable (the president) and the

approximation algorithm in $o(\sqrt{n})$ space. We also show infinitely many
weaker monarchy functions for which CSPs using such constraints are
non-trivially approximable by $O(\log(n))$ space sketching algorithms.
Moreover, we give the first example of sketching approximable asymmetric

stratified atmosphere of a low-mass star with an outer convective envelope.
Under the conditions of slow, rotationally constrained dynamics, we derive a
local dispersion relation for atmospheric waves in a fully compressible
stratified fluid. This dispersion relation describes the zonal and radial
propagation of acoustic waves and gravito-inertial waves. Thermal Rossby waves
are just one class of prograde-propagating gravito-inertial wave that manifests
when the buoyancy frequency is small compared to the rotation rate of the star.
From this dispersion relation, we identify the radii at which waves naturally
reflect and demonstrate how thermal Rossby waves can be trapped radially in a
waveguide that permits free propagation in the longitudinal direction. We
explore this trapping further by presenting analytic solutions for thermal
Rossby waves within an isentropically stratified atmosphere that models a zone
of efficient convective heat transport. We find that within such an atmosphere,
waves of short zonal wavelength have a wave cavity that is radially thin and
confined within the outer reaches of the convection zone near the star's
equator. The same behavior is evinced by the thermal Rossby waves that appear
at convective onset in numerical simulations of convection within rotating
spheres. Finally, we suggest that stable thermal Rossby waves could exist in
the lower portion of the Sun's convection zone, despite that region's unstable
stratification. For long wavelengths, the Sun's rotation rate is sufficiently
rapid to stabilize convective motions and the resulting overstable convective
modes are identical to thermal Rossby waves.

demographic, economic, political, and geographical factors with endogenous
social mechanisms, with the objective of identifying factors limiting migration

graph models, allowing us to calibrate it to the (valued) network of
intercounty U.S. migration flows during the 2011-2015 period. Our analysis
reveals a pattern of segmented immobility, where fewer people migrate between
counties with dissimilar political contexts, levels of urbanization, and racial
compositions. Probing our model using ""knockout"" experiments suggests that one
would have observed approximately 3 million (17%) more intercounty migrants
over the study period were the segmented immobility mechanisms inoperative.
This analysis suggests that internal migration in the current era is driven not

It also reveals social and political cleavages that underlie geographical

so as to minimize maximum job completion time, the makespan. In the scheduling
literature, the problem is commonly considered to be solvable in polynomial
time by linear programming (LP) techniques proposed in Lawler and Labetoulle
\cite{ll78}. The authors in \cite{ll78} give a LP formulation of the version
with simultaneously released jobs and show how an optimal solution to this LP
can be used to construct an optimal schedule to the latter problem. As the
current study shows, for non-simultaneously released jobs, unlikely, there
exist a linear program such that a schedule with the minimum makespan can be
constructed based on an optimal LP solution. We also prove that, in case no
splitting of the same job on a machine is allowed (i.e., job part assigned to a
machine is to be processed without an interruption on that machine), the
problem is NP-hard. As a side result, we obtain that, whenever job splitting is
not allowed, given an optimal LP solution, it is NP-hard to find an optimal
schedule with the minimum makespan that agrees with that LP solution. We also
extend the schedule construction procedure based on an optimal LP solution from
Lawler and Labetoulle \cite{ll78} for non-simultaneously released jobs. The
extended procedure, among all feasible schedules that agree with any feasible
(not necessarily optimal) LP solution, generates one with the minimum makespan.
Such procedure is helpful, in particular, because, as we show, there may exist
no optimal schedule that agrees with an optimal LP solution if jobs are
non-simultaneously released.

electronically ideal FE system) the dependence of measured emission current on
measured voltage. The aim is to use experimental exponent-values kappa^expt in
an attempt to decide between two alternative FE theories, for both of which
allowable (but different) ranges of kappa have been established. At present,
there is limited information on what contribution to the ""total theoretical
kappa"" is made by the voltage-dependence of the notional emission area: this
paper reports simulations intended to add to our knowledge about this, for four
common assumed shapes of an emitter apex. The methodology is then applied to
the choice between 1928/29 Fowler-Nordheim (FN) FE theory and 1956 Murphy-Good

1956 MG FE theory is ""better physics"" than 1928/29 FN FE theory). Like all
previous attempts to reach the known correct theoretical conclusion by
experimentally based argument, the outcome of the new methodology tends to
favour MG FE theory, but is formally indecisive at this stage of discussion.
There seems an urgent need for better methods of measuring kappa^expt and of

open-book datastore for retrieval regarding prompt-based instance
representations and corresponding relation labels as memorized key-value pairs.
During inference, the model can infer relations by linearly interpolating the
base output of PLM with the non-parametric nearest neighbor distribution over
the datastore. In this way, our model not only infers relation through
knowledge stored in the weights during training but also assists
decision-making by unwinding and querying examples in the open-book datastore.

should generally have large mass-loss rates (> ~ 1e-6 Msun/yr) in order to
account for the observed rise time and peak luminosity distribution. Therefore,
mass-loss prescriptions that predict significantly low mass-loss rates for
helium stars in this luminosity range is inconsistent with the supernova radio
observations. It is also possible that massive helium stars shortly before
their explosion generally undergo mass-loss enhancement in a different way from
the standard radiation-driven wind mechanism.

that an intense $^{51}$Cr radioactive neutrino source is suitable for observing
the ITBD reaction for the first time. As the Sun is another source of intense

methods for identifying edges in the true phylogeny -- and by extension the

small number of possible internal edges among a set of taxa (compared to the
number of binary trees) makes these methods attractive, however more could be
done to evaluate their effectiveness for inferring phylogenetic trees. This is
the case particularly for subflattenings, and our work makes progress in this
area. We introduce software for constructing and evaluating subflattenings for
splits, utilising a number of methods to make computing subflattenings more
tractable. We then present the results of simulations we have performed in
order to compare the effectiveness of subflattenings to that of flattenings in
terms of split score distributions, and susceptibility to possible biases. We
find that subflattenings perform similarly to flattenings in terms of the
distribution of split scores on the trees we examined, but may be less affected
by bias arising from both split size/balance and long branch attraction. These
insights are useful for developing effective algorithms to utilise these tools

non-Newtonian fluid peeling two linearly elastic sheets at low Reynolds

model, and an inelastic fluid with shear thinning viscosity (generalized
Newtonian fluid). In the limit of small gap between the sheets, we invoke a
lubrication approximation and numerically solve for the gap height between the
two sheets during the start-up of a pressure-controlled flow. What we observe
is that for an impulse pressure applied to the sheet inlet, the peeling front
moves diffusively toward the end of the sheet when the fluid is Newtonian.
However, when one examines a complex fluid with shear thinning, the propagation
front moves sub-diffusively in time , but ultimately reaches the end faster due
to an order of magnitude larger pre-factor for the propagation speed. We
provide scaling analyses and similarity solutions to delineate several regimes
of peeling based on the sheet elasticity, Wi number (for sPTT fluid), and shear
thinning exponent (for generalized Newtonian fluid). To conclude, this study
aims to afford to the experimentalist a system of knowledge to delineate the

  Results showed a strong correlation between heave responses and significant

responses were low (in high-frequency, low wave height sea states). Given the

unidirectionally without scattering in complex boundaries. The TLCW is studied
theoretically as a spectral flow of the Hamiltonian
Pseudo-Differential-Operator (PDO) $\hat{H}$ for waves in an inhomogeneous
plasma. The semi-classical parameter of the Weyl quantization for plasma waves
is identified to be the ratio between electron gyro-radius and the
inhomogeneity scale length of the system. Hermitian eigenmode bundles of the
bulk Hamiltonian symbol H for plasma waves are formally defined. Because
momentum space in classical continuous media is contractible in general, the
topology of the eigenmode bundles over momentum space is trivial. This is in
stark contrast to condensed matters. Nontrivial topology of the eigenmode
bundles in classical continuous media only exists over phase space. A boundary
isomorphism theorem is established to facilitate the calculation of Chern
numbers of eigenmode bundles over non-contractible manifolds in phase space. It
also defines a topological charge of an isolated Weyl point in phase space
without adopting any connection. Using these algebraic topological techniques
and an index theorem formulated by Faure, it is rigorously proven that the
nontrivial topology at the Weyl point of the Langmuir wave-cyclotron wave
resonance generates the TLCW as a spectral flow. It is shown that the TLCW can
be faithfully modeled by a tilted Dirac cone in phase space. An analytical

of double white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way. However, the search for double
white dwarfs in the gravitational wave data will be time-consuming due to the
large number of templates involved and antenna response calculation. In this
paper, we implement an iterative combinatorial algorithm to search for double
white dwarfs in MLDC-3.1 data. To quickly determine the rough parameters of the
target sources, the following algorithms are adopted in a coarse search
process: (1) using the downsampling method to reduce the number of original
data points; (2) using the undersampling method to speed up the generation of a
single waveform template; (3) using the stochastic template bank method to
quickly construct the waveform template bank while achieving high coverage of
the parameter space; (4) Combining the FFT acceleration algorithm with the
stochastic template bank to reduce the calculation time of a single template. A
fine search process is applied to further determine the parameters of the
signals based on the coarse search, for which we adopt the particle swarm
optimization. Finally, we detected $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ double white dwarf
signals, validating the feasibility of our method.

of axons embedded in extra cellular matrix (ECM) when subjected to harmonic
uniaxial stretch under purely non-affine kinematic boundary conditions. The
proposed modeling approach combines hyper-elastic (such as Ogden model) and
time/frequency domain viscoelastic constitutive models to evaluate the effect
of parametrically varying oligodendrocyte-axon tethering under harmonic stretch
at 50Hz. A hybrid hyper-viscoelastic material (HVE) model enabled the analysis
of repeated uniaxial load on stress propagation and damage accumulation in
white matter.
  In the proposed FEM, oligodendrocyte connections to axons are depicted via a
spring-dashpot model. This tethering technique facilitates contact definition
at various locations, parameterizes connection points and varies stiffness of
connection hubs. Results from a home-grown FE submodel configuration of a
single oligodendrocyte tethered to axons at various locations are presented.
Root mean square deviation (RMSD) are computed between stress-strain plots to
depict trends in mechanical response. Steady-state dynamic (SSD) simulations
show stress relaxation in axons. Gradual axonal softening under repetitive
loads is illustrated employing Prony series - HVE models. Representative
von-Mises stress plots indicate that undulated axons experience bending
stresses along their tortuous path, suggesting greater susceptibility to damage
accumulation and fatigue failure due to repeated strains.

sensing platform, with applications in both the physical and life sciences. The
development of isotopically engineered $^{15}$NV diamond offers advantages over
naturally occurring $^{14}$NV for magnetometry, due to its simpler hyperfine
structure. However, for sensing modalities requiring a bias magnetic field not
aligned with the sensing NV axis, the absence of a quadrupole moment in the
$^{15}$N nuclear spin leads to pronounced envelope modulation effects in
time-dependent measurements of $^{15}$NV spin evolution. While such behavior in
spin echo experiments are well studied, analogous effects in Ramsey
measurements and the implications for magnetometry remain under-explored. Here,
we derive the modulated $^{15}$NV Ramsey response to a misaligned bias field,
using a simple vector description of the effective magnetic field on the
nuclear spin. The predicted modulation properties are then compared to
experimental results, revealing significant magnetic sensitivity loss if

AI. Structural injustice has an analytical and an evaluative component. The
analytical component consists of structural explanations that are well-known in
the social sciences. The evaluative component is a theory of justice.
Structural injustice is a powerful conceptual tool that allows researchers and
practitioners to identify, articulate, and perhaps even anticipate, AI biases.
The chapter begins with an example of racial bias in AI that arises from
structural injustice. The chapter then presents the concept of structural
injustice as introduced by the philosopher Iris Marion Young. The chapter
moreover argues that structural injustice is well suited as an approach to the
governance of AI and compares this approach to alternative approaches that
start from analyses of harms and benefits or from value statements. The chapter
suggests that structural injustice provides methodological and normative
foundations for the values and concerns of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
The chapter closes with an outlook onto the idea of structure and on
responsibility. The idea of a structure is central to justice. An open
theoretical research question is to what extent AI is itself part of the
structure of society. Finally, the practice of responsibility is central to
structural injustice. Even if they cannot be held responsible for the existence
of structural injustice, every individual and every organization has some
responsibility to address structural injustice going forward.

connectivity and ensemble dynamics. This relationship is notoriously difficult
to approach mathematically in natural, complex networks. In our work, we aim to
understand it in a canonical framework, using complex quadratic node dynamics,
coupled in networks which we call complex quadratic networks (CQNs).
  After previously defining extensions of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets for
networks, we currently focus on the behavior of the node-wise projections of
these sets, and on defining and analyzing the phenomena of node clustering and
synchronization. We investigate the mechanisms that lead to nodes exhibiting
identical or different Mandelbrot set. We propose that clustering is strongly
determined by the network connectivity patterns, with the geometry of these
clusters further controlled by the connection weights. We then illustrate the
concept of synchronization in an existing set of whole brain,
tractography-based networks obtained from 197 human subjects using diffusion
tensor imaging.
  Synchronization and clustering are well-studied in the context of networks of

principles in dynamic networks, and may help extend theoretical results to
natural, complex systems.

Recent research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has advanced the
development of various toxicity detection models with the intention of
identifying and mitigating toxic language from existing systems. Despite the
abundance of research in this area, less attention has been given to
adversarial attacks that force the system to generate toxic language and the
defense against them. Existing work to generate such attacks is either based on
human-generated attacks which is costly and not scalable or, in case of
automatic attacks, the attack vector does not conform to human-like language,
which can be detected using a language model loss. In this work, we propose
attacks against conversational agents that are imperceptible, i.e., they fit
the conversation in terms of coherency, relevancy, and fluency, while they are
effective and scalable, i.e., they can automatically trigger the system into
generating toxic language. We then propose a defense mechanism against such
attacks which not only mitigates the attack but also attempts to maintain the
conversational flow. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show that our
defense is effective at avoiding toxic language generation even against
imperceptible toxicity triggers while the generated language fits the
conversation in terms of coherency and relevancy. Lastly, we establish the
generalizability of such a defense mechanism on language generation models
beyond conversational agents.

coupled to a field, where the detected particles are the field excitations.
This is known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. Research using this model has often
focused on either a completely classical description of the external degrees of
freedom of the detector, or a full field-theoretic treatment, where the
detector itself is described as a field. Recently there has been much interest
in quantum aspects of the detector's center of mass -- either described as
moving in superposition along semiclassical trajectories, or dynamically
evolving under a non-relativistic Hamiltonian. However, the processes of
interest -- the absorption or emission of field particles -- necessarily change
the detector's rest mass by the amount of energy of the absorbed or emitted
field quanta. Neither of the above models can capture such effects. Here we
incorporate the quantization of the detector's mass-energy into the
Unruh-DeWitt model. We show that internal energy changes due to emission or
absorption are relevant even in the lowest energy limit. Specifically,
corrections to transition rates due to the detector's mass changing cannot be
ignored unless the entire center of mass dynamics is also ignored. Our results
imply that one cannot have a consistent model of the Unruh-DeWitt detector as a
massive particle without including the mass-energy equivalence.

compressing deep neural networks. The typical way of conducting knowledge
distillation is to train the student network under the supervision of the

not change for all the training samples, throughout the whole distillation
process. In this work, we argue that distillation spots should be adaptive to
training samples and distillation epochs. We thus propose a new distillation
strategy, termed spot-adaptive KD (SAKD), to adaptively determine the
distillation spots in the teacher network per sample, at every training
iteration during the whole distillation period. As SAKD actually focuses on
""where to distill"" instead of ""what to distill"" that is widely investigated by
most existing works, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation
methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments with 10

SAKD for improving their distillation performance, under both homogeneous and

protocols over a collective-noise channel are proposed. Decoherence-free
subspace (DFS) is used to erase the influence from two kinds of collective
noise, i.e., collective-dephasing noise and collective-rotation noise, where
each logical qubit is composed of two physical qubits and free from noise. In
each of the two proposed protocols, the secret messages are encoded on the
initial logical qubits via two composite unitary operations. Moreover, the
single-photon measurements rather than the Bell-state measurements or the more
complicated measurements are needed for decoding, making the two proposed
protocols easier to implement. The initial state of each logical qubit is
privately shared between the two authenticated users through the direct
transmission of its auxiliary counterpart. Consequently, the information
leakage problem is avoided in the two proposed protocols. Moreover, the
detailed security analysis also shows that Eve's several famous active attacks

applications such as photodetectors. However, it remains an open question
whether performance crossover will occur when the channel material is
downsized. Here we report on the fabrication and testing of photodetectors
based on exfoliated quasi-1D BiSeI thin wires. Compared with the device on bulk
crystal, a significantly enhanced photoresponse is observed, which is
manifested by a series of performance parameters, including ultrahigh
responsivity (7 x 10$^4$ A W$^{-1}$), specific detectivity (2.5 x 10$^{14}$
Jones) and external quantum efficiency (1.8 x 10$^7$%) when $V_{\textrm {ds}}$

photoconductive effect is unlikely to account for such a superior
photoresponse, which is ultimately understood in terms of the increased
specific surface area and the photogating effect caused by trapping states.

is technically ill-posed, and becomes more difficult considering that various
sensing imperfections would appear in the point clouds obtained by practical
depth scanning. In literature, a rich set of methods has been proposed, and
reviews of existing methods are also provided. However, existing reviews are
short of thorough investigations on a common benchmark. The present paper aims
to review and benchmark existing methods in the new era of deep learning
surface reconstruction. To this end, we contribute a large-scale benchmarking
dataset consisting of both synthetic and real-scanned data; the benchmark
includes object- and scene-level surfaces and takes into account various
sensing imperfections that are commonly encountered in practical depth
scanning. We conduct thorough empirical studies by comparing existing methods
on the constructed benchmark, and pay special attention on robustness of
existing methods against various scanning imperfections; we also study how
different methods generalize in terms of reconstructing complex surface shapes.
Our studies help identify the best conditions under which different methods
work, and suggest some empirical findings. For example, while deep learning
methods are increasingly popular, our systematic studies suggest that,
surprisingly, a few classical methods perform even better in terms of both
robustness and generalization; our studies also suggest that the practical
challenges of misalignment of point sets from multi-view scanning, missing of
surface points, and point outliers remain unsolved by all the existing surface
reconstruction methods. We expect that the benchmark and our studies would be
valuable both for practitioners and as a guidance for new innovations in future

from communication-intensive systems towards intelligent computing-intensive
architectures. A key research area that enables this transition is semantic
communications, whereby the communication process conveys the meaning of
messages instead of being a mere reconstruction process of raw, naive data
bits. In this paper, a novel quantum semantic communications (QSC) framework is
proposed to develop reasoning-based future communication systems with quantum
semantic representations that are characterized with minimalism, efficiency,
and accuracy. In particular, the concepts of quantum embedding and
high-dimensional Hilbert spaces are exploited so as to extract the meaning of
classical data. Moreover, in order to equip our approach with minimalism and
efficiency, an unsupervised quantum machine learning (QML) technique, namely,
quantum clustering is employed. Quantum clustering enables extraction of
contextual information and distinct characterization of the semantics of the
message to be conveyed. Subsequently, to successfully transmit the constructed
semantic representations, quantum communication links are used to transfer the
quantum states. This new QSC framework exploits unique quantum principles such
as the minimalism of entangled photons, quantum-semantic entropy of noise, and
quantum fidelity. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can save
around 85\% of quantum communication resources, i.e., entangled photons,
compared to semantic-agnostic quantum communication schemes. Results also show
the benefits of increasing the number of dimensions on the expressivity of the
semantic representations.

galactic nuclei (AGNs) is much more challenging than for active sources due to
the added complexity of accurately determining the time since the central black
hole switched off. Independent spectral modelling of remnant lobes enables the
derivation of the remnant ratio, $R_\mathrm{rem}$, (i.e. `off-time/source
age'), thus reducing this complexity back to that of active sources however,
the requirement of high-frequency ($\gtrsim5\,$GHz) coverage makes the
application of this technique over large-area radio surveys difficult. In this
work we propose a new method, which relies on the observed brightness of
backflow of Fanaroff-Riley type~II lobes, combined with the \emph{Radio AGN in
Semi-Analytic Environments} (RAiSE) code, to measure the duration of the
remnant phase. Sensitive radio observations of the remnant radio galaxy
J2253-34 are obtained to provide a robust comparison of this technique with the
canonical spectral analysis and modelling methods. We find that the remnant
lifetimes modelled by each method are consistent; spectral modelling yields
$R_\mathrm{rem} = 0.23\pm0.02$, compared to $R_\mathrm{rem} = 0.26\pm0.02$ from
our new method. We examine the viability of applying our proposed technique to
low-frequency radio surveys using mock radio source populations, and examine
whether the technique is sensitive to any intrinsic properties of radio AGNs.
Our results show that the technique can be used to robustly classify active and
remnant populations, with the most confident predictions for the remnant ratio,
and thus off-time, in the longest-lived radio sources ($>50~$Myr) and those at
higher redshifts ($z > 0.1$).

design of cooperative reflection and synchronization algorithm for the

devised jointly at the RISs and the destination to compensate the multiple

flexible, end-to-end model for AIM, adapting for many intersection scenarios.
While DRL is prone to collisions as the actions of multiple sides in the

hierarchical RL framework where models at different levels vary in receptive
scope, action step length, and feedback period of reward. The upper layer model
accelerate CAVs to prevent them from being clashed, while the lower layer model
adjust the trends from upper layer model to avoid the change of mobile state

widely used to test the independence of variable(s) of interest (X) with an

design-based inference that relies solely on the iid sampling of (X,Z) to
produce exact finite-sample p-values that are constructed using any test

tackles the independence problem while allowing the data to be adaptively

characterize the powers of both the iid sampling procedure and the adaptive

the CRT that pulls all arms independently with equal probability. We also
surprisingly find that the ART can be more powerful than even the CRT that uses
an oracle iid sampling procedure when the signal is relatively strong. We
believe that the proposed adaptive procedure is successful because it takes
arms that may initially look like ""fake"" signals due to random chance and
stabilizes them closer to ""null"" signals. We additionally showcase the ART to a

presents DeepExtrema, a novel framework that combines a deep neural network
(DNN) with generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to forecast the block
maximum value of a time series. Implementing such a network is a challenge as
the framework must preserve the inter-dependent constraints among the GEV model
parameters even when the DNN is initialized. We describe our approach to
address this challenge and present an architecture that enables both
conditional mean and quantile prediction of the block maxima. The extensive
experiments performed on both real-world and synthetic data demonstrated the
superiority of DeepExtrema compared to other baseline methods.

structure of a nascent magnetar is not caused by a single mechanism but by
multiple time-varying quadrupole moments such as those present in magnetically
induced deformation, starquake-induced ellipticity, and accretion
column-induced deformation. The magnetar loses its angular momentum through
accretion, magnetic dipole radiation, and GW radiation. Within this scenario,
we calculate the evolution of GWs from a newborn magnetar by considering the
above three deformations. We find that the GW evolution depends on the physical
parameters of the magnetar (e.g., period and surface magnetic field), the
adiabatic index, and the fraction of poloidal magnetic energy to the total
magnetic energy. In general the GW radiation from a magnetically induced
deformation is dominant if the surface magnetic field of the magnetar is large,
but the GW radiation from magnetar starquakes is more efficient when there is a
larger adiabatic index if all other magnetar parameters remain the same. We
also find that the GW radiation is not very sensitive to different magnetar
equations of state.

cell have tetrahedral and planar oxygen coordinations (labelled as Mn(1) and
Mn(2)), while the Cr atom is in the centre of distorted oxygen octahedron.
While the bulk magnetization and neutron diffraction suggest a simpler
ferrimagnetic order (T_C=49 K) between Mn2+ and Cr3+ spins, the exchange
interactions are more complex than that expected from a two sublattice magnetic
system. The electronic structure calculations yield a ferrimagnetic insulating
ground state even in absence of Hubbard U which persists for a wide range of U.
The Mn(1)-O-Mn(2) (out of plane and in-plane), Mn(1)-O-Cr and Mn(2)-O-Cr
superexchange interactions are found to be anti-ferromagnetic, while the
Cr-O-O-Cr super-superexchange is found to be ferromagnetic. The Mn(2)-O-Cr
superexchange is weaker than the Mn(1)-O-Cr superexchange, thus effectively
resulting in ferrimagnetism. From a simple 3-site Hubbard model, we derived
expressions for the antiferromagnetic superexchange strength J_AFM and the
weaker ferromagnetic J_FM. The relative strengths of JAFM for the various
superexchange interactions are in agreement with those obtained from DFT. The
expression for Cr-O-O-Cr super-superexchange strength (J_SS), which is derived
considering a 4-site Hubbard model, predicts a ferromagnetic exchange in
agreement with DFT. Finally, our mean field calculations reveal that assuming a
set of four magnetic sub-lattice for Mn2+ spins and a single magnetic

additional filters. The soft-constrained scheme generates airfoils that exhibit
slight deviations from the expected geometric constraints, yet still converge
to the reference airfoil in both geometry space and objective space with some

airfoils with a wider range of geometric diversity while strictly adhering to

pronounced ductility. A strong composition dependence is also seen in the crack
velocity which is on the order of 1800 m/s for glasses with low Na
concentration and decreases to 700 m/s if the concentration is high. We find
that during the fracture of Na-rich glasses very irregular cavities as large as
3-4 nm form ahead of the crack front, indicating the presence of nanoductility
in these glasses. Before fracture occurs, the local composition, structure, and
mechanical properties are heterogeneous in space and show a strong dependence

communicate with downlink users and probe detection signals to a moving target.
Then, the metrics of radar sensing and communications are respectively
introduced, followed by a RSMA-assisted ISAC waveform design example which
jointly minimizes the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of target estimation and maximizes
the minimum fairness rate (MFR) amongst communication users subject to the
per-antenna power constraint. The superiority of RSMA-assisted ISAC is verifed
through simulation results in both terrestrial and satellite scenarios. RSMA is
demonstrated to be a powerful multiple access and interference management
strategy for ISAC, and provides a better communication-sensing trade-off
compared with the conventional benchmark strategies. Consequently, RSMA is a
promising technology for next generation multiple access (NGMA) and future

dysfunction caused by liver failure. Altered synaptic plasticity is supposed to
play a major role in the pathophysiology of HE. Here, we used paired
associative stimulation with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25), a
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol, to test synaptic plasticity
of the motor cortex in patients with manifest HE. Methods: 23 HE-patients and
23 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Motor evoked potential (MEP)
amplitudes were assessed as measure for cortical excitability. Time courses of
MEP amplitude changes after the PAS25 intervention were compared between both
groups. Results: MEP-amplitudes increased after PAS25 in the control group,
indicating PAS25-induced synaptic plasticity in healthy controls, as expected.
In contrast, MEP-amplitudes within the HE group did not change and were lower
than in the control group, indicating no induction of plasticity. Conclusion:
Our study revealed reduced synaptic plasticity of the primary motor cortex in
HE. Significance: Reduced synaptic plasticity in HE provides a link between
pathological changes on the molecular level and early clinical symptoms of the
disease. This decrease may be caused by disturbances in the glutamatergic
neurotransmission due to the known hyperammonemia in HE patients.

performance of these algorithms in practice can vary significantly due to
varying (and often large) hidden constants. In this work, we investigate the
question of designing the protocol with the smallest variance. We show that
PrivUnit (Bhowmick et al. 2018) with optimized parameters achieves the optimal
variance among a large family of locally private randomizers. To prove this
result, we establish some properties of local randomizers, and use
symmetrization arguments that allow us to write the optimal randomizer as the
optimizer of a certain linear program. These structural results, which should
extend to other problems, then allow us to show that the optimal randomizer
belongs to the PrivUnit family.
  We also develop a new variant of PrivUnit based on the Gaussian distribution
which is more amenable to mathematical analysis and enjoys the same optimality
guarantees. This allows us to establish several useful properties on the exact
constants of the optimal error as well as to numerically estimate these
constants.

  Namely, we show that closed geodesics (with a flat $\mathbb{C}$-bundle) of a
hyperbolic pair of pants have a one-to-one correspondence with indecomposable
Cohen-Macaulay modules for $xyz$ with multiplicity one that are locally free on
the punctured spectrum. In particular, this correspondence is established first

correspondence between Cohen-Macaulay modules and matrix factorizations due to
Eisenbud. For the latter, we compute explicit Macaulayfications of modules from
Burban-Drozd's classification and find a canonical form of the corresponding
matrix factorizations. In the sequel, we will show that indecomposable modules

show that the NC Minkowski spacetime parametrized either with spherical polar
coordinates or with parabolic coordinates has nontrivial NC corrections to
Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor and curvature scalar. Apparently, there
are no such corrections if we choose rectilinear coordinates or even
cylindrical coordinates, for which the metric in the commutative-counterpart is
dependent on at most one coordinate only. We present both first order and
second order calculations. The emergent curvature corrections might seem to
raise the question of whether the statement of curvature is
coordinate-dependent, but note, for example, that the transformation from
spherical polar system to Cartesian system is not a diffeomorphism as such
since its non-injective nature makes it a local diffeomorphism. In other words,
if the flat-spacetime metric tensor in the commutative case depends on more
than one curvilinear coordinates, the introduction of noncommutativity among
these coordinates can possibly make the spacetime curved. It is worth remarking
that such a curvature emerges in the context of NC Minkowski spacetime in the
absence of any gauge or matter fields. It is purely an NC geometric effect.

  Depth Estimation","10 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-view depth estimation plays a critical role in reconstructing and
understanding the 3D world. Recent learning-based methods have made significant
progress in it. However, multi-view depth estimation is fundamentally a
correspondence-based optimization problem, but previous learning-based methods
mainly rely on predefined depth hypotheses to build correspondence as the cost
volume and implicitly regularize it to fit depth prediction, deviating from the
essence of iterative optimization based on stereo correspondence. Thus, they
suffer unsatisfactory precision and generalization capability. In this paper,
we are the first to explore more general image correlations to establish
correspondences dynamically for depth estimation. We design a novel iterative
multi-view depth estimation framework mimicking the optimization process, which
consists of 1) a correlation volume construction module that models the pixel
similarity between a reference image and source images as all-to-all
correlations; 2) a flow-based depth initialization module that estimates the
depth from the 2D optical flow; 3) a novel correlation-guided depth refinement
module that reprojects points in different views to effectively fetch relevant
correlations for further fusion and integrate the fused correlation for
iterative depth update. Without predefined depth hypotheses, the fused
correlations establish multi-view correspondence in an efficient way and guide
the depth refinement heuristically. We conduct sufficient experiments on
ScanNet, DeMoN, ETH3D, and 7Scenes to demonstrate the superiority of our method
on multi-view depth estimation and its best generalization ability.

associated with stationary type IV bursts are close to disk center ($\approx
60-70 \%$). The active regions associated with moving type IV bursts are more
evenly distributed across the surface, i.e $\approx 56 \%$ and $\approx 44 \%$,

computation being a factor about 10 times faster if only the CPU was used. We
use this code to examine several disk structures all in the SANE state. We find
that: (i) increasing the magnetic field, while in the SANE state does not
affect the mass accretion rate; (ii) Simultaneous increase of the disk size and
the magnetic field, while keeping the ratio of energies fixed, lead to the
destruction of the jet once the magnetic flux through the horizon decrease
below a certain limit. This demonstrates that the existence of the jet is not a
linear function of the initial magnetic field strength; (iii) the structure of
the jet is a weak function of the adiabatic index of the gas, with relativistic
gas tend to have a wider jet.

contact with friends and to share information. In Twitter, users can connect
with other users by following them, who in turn can follow back. In recent
years, researchers studied several properties of social networks and designed
random graph models to describe them. Many of these approaches either focus on
the generation of undirected graphs or on the creation of directed graphs
without modeling the dependencies between reciprocal (i.e., two directed edges
of opposite direction between two nodes) and directed edges. We propose an
approach to generate directed social network graphs that creates reciprocal and
directed edges and considers the correlation between the respective degree
sequences.
  Our model relies on crawled directed graphs in Twitter, on which information
w.r.t. a topic is exchanged or disseminated. While these graphs exhibit a high
clustering coefficient and small average distances between random node pairs
(which is typical in real-world networks), their degree sequences seem to
follow a $\chi^2$-distribution rather than power law. To achieve high
clustering coefficients, we apply an edge rewiring procedure that preserves the
node degrees.
  We compare the crawled and the created graphs, and simulate certain
algorithms for information dissemination and epidemic spreading on them. The
results show that the created graphs exhibit very similar topological and
algorithmic properties as the real-world graphs, providing evidence that they
can be used as surrogates in social network analysis. Furthermore, our model is
highly scalable, which enables us to create graphs of arbitrary size with
almost the same properties as the corresponding real-world networks.

performance. However, most existing methods pay less attention to the
efficiency, making it still challenging to quickly extract relations from
massive or streaming text data in realistic scenarios. The main efficiency
bottleneck is that these methods use a Transformer-based pre-trained language
model for encoding, which heavily affects the training speed and inference
speed. To address this issue, we propose a fast relation extraction model
(FastRE) based on convolutional encoder and improved cascade binary tagging
framework. Compared to previous work, FastRE employs several innovations to
improve efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE
adopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated
convolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces
the computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the
satisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging
framework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to
accelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then
utilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher
tagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results
demonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance,
and achieves 3-10x training speed, 7-15x inference speed faster, and 1/100
parameters compared to the state-of-the-art models, while the performance is
still competitive.

solutions in higher dimensions when the nonlinearities have super quadratic
growth rates. In dimension one, it has been shown recently that one can have
global existence of bounded solutions if nonlinearities are at most cubic. For
the cubic intermediate sum condition, i.e. nonlinearities might have
arbitrarily high growth rates, an additional entropy inequality had to be
imposed. In this article, we remove this extra entropy assumption completely
and obtain global boundedness for reaction-diffusion systems with cubic

phenomenon for mass dissipating systems, that is the mass dissipation implies a
dissipation in a Morrey space $\mathsf{M}^{1,\delta}(\Omega)$ for some
$\delta>0$. As far as we are concerned, it is the first time such a bound is
derived for mass dissipating reaction-diffusion systems. Extensions include

Analysis of archival CORALIE radial velocity data leads to a 3$\sigma$ upper

Skorokhod problem with a reflective boundary condition at 0. For smooth
dynamics, Mortensen introduced an energy for the likelihood that the state
variable produces-up to perturbations disturbances-a given observation in a
finite time interval, while reaching a given target state at the final time.
The Mortensen observer is the minimiser of this energy. For dynamics given by a
variational inequality and therefore not reversible in time, we study the
definition of a Mortensen estimator. On the one hand, we address this problem
by relaxing the boundary constraint of the synthetic variable and then
proposing an approximated variant of the Mortensen estimator that uses the
resulting nonlinear smooth dynamics. On the other hand, inspired by the smooth
dynamics approach, we study the vanishing viscosity limit of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation satisfied by the Hopf-Cole transform of the solution
of the robust Zakai equation. We prove a stability result that allows us to
interpret the limiting solution as the value function associated with a control
problem rather than an estimation problem. In contrast to the case of smooth
dynamics, here the zero-noise limit of the robust form of the Zakai equation
cannot be understood from the Bellman equation of the value function arising in
Mortensen's deterministic estimation. This may unveil a violation of
equivalence for non-reversible dynamics between the Mortensen approach and the

multi-view clustering (MVC). Recently with the introduction of popular
contrastive learning, the consistency learning of views has been further
enhanced in MVC, leading to promising performance. However, by contrast, the
complementarity has not received sufficient attention except just in the
feature facet, where the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) term or
the independent encoder-decoder network is usually adopted to capture
view-specific information. This motivates us to reconsider the complementarity
learning of views comprehensively from multiple facets including the feature-,
view-label- and contrast- facets, while maintaining the view consistency. We
empirically find that all the facets contribute to the complementarity
learning, especially the view-label facet, which is usually neglected by

motivation is twofold: assess the power of tensor networks for such models, and
probe the 2D classical analog of a 1D quantum model of hard-core bosons that
has recently attracted significant attention in the context of experiments on
chains of Rydberg atoms. Accordingly, we concentrate on two planes in the 3D
parameter space spanned by the activity and the coupling constants in the two
diagonal directions. We first investigate the only case studied so far with
Monte Carlo simulations, the case of opposite coupling constants. We confirm
that, away and not too far from the integrable 3-state Potts point, the
transition out of the period-3 phase appears to be unique in the Huse-Fisher
chiral universality class, albeit with significantly different exponents as
compared to Monte Carlo. We also identify two additional phase transitions not
reported so far for that model, a Lifshitz disorder line, and an Ising
transition for large enough activity. To make contact with 1D quantum models of
Rydberg atoms, we then turn to a plane where the ferromagnetic coupling is kept
fixed, and we show that the resulting phase diagram is very similar, the only
difference being that the Ising transition becomes first-order through a
tricritical Ising point, in agreement with Baxter's prediction that this plane
should contain a tricritical Ising point, and in remarkable, almost
quantitative agreement with the phase diagram of the 1D quantum version of the

objective for autoregressive language models (LMs). However, without
considering the penalization of problematic tokens, LMs trained using
cross-entropy exhibit text degeneration. To address this, unlikelihood training
has been proposed to reduce the probability of unlikely tokens predicted by
LMs. But unlikelihood does not consider the relationship between the label
tokens and unlikely token candidates, thus showing marginal improvements in
degeneration. We propose a new contrastive token learning objective that
inherits the advantages of cross-entropy and unlikelihood training and avoids
their limitations. The key idea is to teach a LM to generate high probabilities
for label tokens and low probabilities of negative candidates. Comprehensive
experiments on language modeling and open-domain dialogue generation tasks show
that the proposed contrastive token objective yields much less repetitive
texts, with a higher generation quality than baseline approaches, achieving the
new state-of-the-art performance on text degeneration.

how the field conceptualizes gender both explicitly (e.g. through definitions

we split these articles into two sections by time.
  We find that the majority of the articles do not make their theorization of
gender explicit, even if they clearly define ""bias."" Almost none use a model of
gender that is intersectional or inclusive of nonbinary genders; and many
conflate sex characteristics, social gender, and linguistic gender in ways that
disregard the existence and experience of trans, nonbinary, and intersex

acknowledging that gender is a complicated reality, however, very few articles
manage to put this acknowledgment into practice. In addition to analyzing these

this end, we present a robust and easy-to-use parametric method to reshape the

portrait video, our method consists of two main stages: stabilized face

estimating face rigid pose transformations across video frames. Then we jointly
optimize multiple frames to reconstruct an accurate face identity, followed by
recovering face expressions over the entire video. In the second stage, we
first reshape the reconstructed 3D face using a parametric reshaping model

the need to satisfy three critical conditions simultaneously: quality,
controllability and speed, which renders any methods that need offline
computation (or post-processing) or cannot incorporate (often unpredictable)
user control undesirable. To this end, we propose a new real-time transition
method to address the aforementioned challenges. Our approach consists of two
key components: motion manifold and conditional transitioning. The former
learns the important low-level motion features and their dynamics; while the
latter synthesizes transitions conditioned on a target frame and the desired
transition duration. We first learn a motion manifold that explicitly models
the intrinsic transition stochasticity in human motions via a multi-modal
mapping mechanism. Then, during generation, we design a transition model which
is essentially a sampling strategy to sample from the learned manifold, based
on the target frame and the aimed transition duration. We validate our method
on different datasets in tasks where no post-processing or offline computation
is allowed. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that our
method is able to generate high-quality motions measured under multiple
metrics. Our method is also robust under various target frames (with extreme
cases).

possibility to understand their physical properties and origin. To date, the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of high-frequency gravitational wave observatories
have announced the detection of more than 85 BH+BH merger events (Abbott et al.
2022a). An important diagnostic feature that can be extracted from the data is
the distribution of effective inspiral spins of the BHs. This distribution is
in clear tension with theoretical expectations from both an isolated binary
star origin, which traditionally predicts close-to aligned BH component spins
(Kalogera 2000; Farr et al. 2017), and formation via dynamical interactions in
dense stellar environments that predicts a symmetric distribution of effective
inspiral spins (Mandel & O'Shaughnessy 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2016b). Here it
is demonstrated that isolated binary evolution can convincingly explain the
observed data if BHs have their spin axis tossed during their formation process
in the core collapse of a massive star, similarly to the process evidently
acting in newborn neutron stars. BH formation without spin-axis tossing,
however, has difficulties reproducing the observed data - even if alignment of
spins prior to the second core collapse is disregarded. Based on simulations
with only a minimum of assumptions, constrains from empirical data can be made
on the spin magnitudes of the first- and second-born BHs, thereby serving to
better understand massive binary star evolution prior to the formation of BHs.

Applying resampling strategies to balance the class distribution of training
instances is a common approach to tackle these problems. Many state-of-the-art
methods find instances of interest close to the decision boundary to drive the
resampling process. However, under-sampling the majority class may potentially
lead to important information loss. Over-sampling also may increase the chance
of overfitting by propagating the information contained in instances from the
minority class. The main contribution of our work is a new method called ICLL
for tackling IBC tasks which is not based on resampling training observations.
Instead, ICLL follows a layered learning paradigm to model the data in two
stages. In the first layer, ICLL learns to distinguish cases close to the
decision boundary from cases which are clearly from the majority class, where
this dichotomy is defined using a hierarchical clustering analysis. In the
subsequent layer, we use instances close to the decision boundary and instances
from the minority class to solve the original predictive task. A second
contribution of our work is the automatic definition of the layers which
comprise the layered learning strategy using a hierarchical clustering model.
This is a relevant discovery as this process is usually performed manually
according to domain knowledge. We carried out extensive experiments using 100
benchmark data sets. The results show that the proposed method leads to a
better performance relatively to several state-of-the-art methods for IBC.

IRSs in different power scaling regimes with optical relays in terms of the
outage probability, diversity and coding gains, and optimal placement. Our
results show that, at the expense of a higher hardware complexity,
relay-assisted FSO links yield a better outage performance at high

performance at low SNRs. Moreover, while it is optimal to place relays
equidistant from Tx and Rx, the optimal location of IRSs depends on the power
scaling regime they operate in.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made prominent
progress in recent years. For training efficiency and scalability, most of the
MARL algorithms make all agents share the same policy or value network.
However, in many complex multi-agent tasks, different agents are expected to
possess specific abilities to handle different subtasks. In those scenarios,
sharing parameters indiscriminately may lead to similar behavior across all
agents, which will limit the exploration efficiency and degrade the final
performance. To balance the training complexity and the diversity of agent
behavior, we propose a novel framework to learn dynamic subtask assignment
(LDSA) in cooperative MARL. Specifically, we first introduce a subtask encoder
to construct a vector representation for each subtask according to its
identity. To reasonably assign agents to different subtasks, we propose an
ability-based subtask selection strategy, which can dynamically group agents
with similar abilities into the same subtask. In this way, agents dealing with
the same subtask share their learning of specific abilities and different
subtasks correspond to different specific abilities. We further introduce two
regularizers to increase the representation difference between subtasks and
stabilize the training by discouraging agents from frequently changing
subtasks, respectively. Empirical results show that LDSA learns reasonable and
effective subtask assignment for better collaboration and significantly
improves the learning performance on the challenging StarCraft II
micromanagement benchmark and Google Research Football.

optical communication and information processing. Here we demonstrate a broadly
tunable add-drop filter based on a double-disk cavity optomechanical system,
side-coupled with a pair of tapered fiber waveguides. By varying the coupling
rates between the cavity and the two waveguides, we investigate the dependence
of the through (drop) efficiency on the coupling rates, which agrees well with
the theoretical results. By optimizing the cavity-waveguide coupling rates, a
drop efficiency of 89% and a transmission of 1.9% have been achieved.
Benefiting from the large optomechanical coupling coefficient of the
double-disk microcavity, a tuning range of 8 nm has been realized, which is
more than one free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity. This is realized by
changing the air gap of the double disk using a fiber tip, which is controlled
by a piezoelectrical nanostage, with a required voltage of 7 V. As a result,
both the through and drop signals can be resonant with any wavelength within
the transparent window of the cavity material, which indicates that the ADF is

One fundamental analysis frequently desired in microfluidic experiments is
counting and tracking the droplets. Specifically, droplet tracking in dense
emulsions is challenging as droplets move in tightly packed configurations.
Sometimes the individual droplets in these dense clusters are hard to resolve,
even for a human observer. Here, two deep learning-based cutting-edge
algorithms for object detection (YOLO) and object tracking (DeepSORT) are
combined into a single image analysis tool, DropTrack, to track droplets in
microfluidic experiments. DropTrack analyzes input videos, extracts droplets'
trajectories, and infers other observables of interest, such as droplet
numbers. Training an object detector network for droplet recognition with
manually annotated images is a labor-intensive task and a persistent
bottleneck. This work partly resolves this problem by training object detector
networks (YOLOv5) with hybrid datasets containing real and synthetic images. We
present an analysis of a double emulsion experiment as a case study to measure
DropTrack's performance. For our test case, the YOLO networks trained with 60%
synthetic images show similar performance in droplet counting as with the one
trained using 100% real images, meanwhile saving the image annotation work by
60%. DropTrack's performance is measured in terms of mean average precision
(mAP), mean square error in counting the droplets, and inference speed. The
fastest configuration of DropTrack runs inference at about 30 frames per
second, well within the standards for real-time image analysis.

are history-dependent: Decisions are made based on the entire history of

observation only, are generally considered useless in the literature because we
can construct POMDP instances for which optimal memoryless policies are
arbitrarily worse than history-dependent ones. Our purpose is to challenge this
belief. We show that optimal memoryless policies can be computed efficiently
using mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and perform reasonably well on a
wide range of instances from the literature. When strengthened with valid
inequalities, the linear relaxation of this MILP provides high quality
upper-bounds on the value of an optimal history dependent policy. Furthermore,
when used with a finite horizon POMDP problem with memoryless policies as
rolling optimization problem, a model predictive control approach leads to an
efficient history-dependent policy, which we call the short memory in the
future (SMF) policy. Basically, the SMF policy leverages these memoryless
policies to build an approximation of the Bellman value function. Numerical
experiments show the efficiency of our approach on benchmark instances from the

climate-related financial risk embedded within a bank loan portfolio, through a
climatic extension of the Basel II IRB model. It uses a Gaussian copula model
calibrated with non stationary macro-correlations in order to reflect the
future evolution of climate-related financial risks. In this complementary
article, we propose a stochastic forward-looking methodology to calibrate
climate macro-correlation evolution from scientific climate data, for physical
and transition efforts specifically. We assume a global physical and transition
risk, likened to persistent greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the
atmosphere. The economic risk is considered stationary and can therefore be
calibrated with a backward-looking methodology. We present 4 key principles to
model the GDP and we propose to model the economic, physical and transition
effort factors with three interdependent stochastic processes allowing for a
calibration with seven well defined parameters. These parameters can be
calibrated using public data. This new approach means not only to evaluate
climate risks without picking any specific scenario but also allows to fill the
gap between current one year approach of regulatory and economic capital models
and the necessarily long-term view of climate risks by designing a framework to
evaluate the resulting credit loss on each step (typically yearly) of the
transition path. This new approach could prove instrumental in the 2022 context
of central banks weighing the pros and cons of a climate capital charge.

investigate the time correlation of the velocity field, and hence of the

simulations, we show that the unequal time correlation function (UETC) of the
Fourier components of the velocity field is Gaussian in the time difference, as
predicted by the ""sweeping"" decorrelation model. We introduce a decorrelation
model that can be extended to wavelengths around the integral scale of the
flow. Supplemented with the evolution laws of the kinetic energy and of the
integral scale, this provides a new model UETC of the turbulent velocity field
consistent with the simulations. We discuss the UETC as a positive definite
kernel, and propose to use the Gibbs kernel for the velocity UETC as a natural
way to ensure positive definiteness of the SGWB. The SGWB is given by a
4-dimensional integration of the resulting anisotropic stress UETC with the
gravitational wave Green's function. We perform this integration using a Monte
Carlo algorithm based on importance sampling, and find that the result matches
that of the simulations. Furthermore, the SGWB obtained from the numerical
integration and from the simulations show close agreement with a model in which
the source is constant in time and abruptly turns off after a few eddy turnover
times. Based on this assumption, we provide an approximate analytical form for
the SGWB spectrum and its scaling with the initial kinetic energy and integral

that including an initial growth phase for the turbulent flow heavily

big-data-related applications, which demonstrates the inherently non-negative
interactions among numerous nodes. A non-negative latent factor (NLF) model
performs efficient representation learning to an HDI matrix, whose learning
process mostly relies on a single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and
multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) algorithm. However, an SLF-NMU algorithm
updates a latent factor based on the current update increment only without
appropriate considerations of past learning information, resulting in slow
convergence. Inspired by the prominent success of a proportional-integral (PI)
controller in various applications, this paper proposes a
Proportional-Integral-incorporated Non-negative Latent Factor (PI-NLF) model
with two-fold ideas: a) establishing an Increment Refinement (IR) mechanism via
considering the past update increments following the principle of a PI
controller; and b) designing an IR-based SLF-NMU (ISN) algorithm to accelerate
the convergence rate of a resultant model. Empirical studies on four HDI
datasets demonstrate that a PI-NLF model outperforms the state-of-the-art
models in both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy for missing

finite element method to estimate the diffusion coefficient governing the long

numerical results demonstrate that the residual of the partial differential
equation after training needs to be small in order to obtain accurate recovery
of the diffusion coefficient. To achieve this, we apply several strategies such
as tuning the weights and the norms used in the loss function as well as
residual based adaptive refinement and exchange of residual training points. We
find that the diffusion coefficient estimated with PINNs from magnetic
resonance images becomes consistent with results from a finite element based
approach when the residuum after training becomes small. The observations
presented in this work are an important first step towards solving inverse

closed-source projects and their development lifecycles. Their usage in
open-source software (OSS) projects is a subject of debate. Although the
studies investigating the SRGMs applicability in OSS context do exist, they are
limited by the number of models and projects considered which might lead to
inconclusive results. In this paper, we present an experimental study of SRGMs
applicability to a total of 88 OSS projects, comparing nine SRGMs, looking at
the stability of the best models on the whole projects, on releases, on
different domains, and according to different projects' attributes. With the
aid of the STRAIT tool, we automated repository mining, data processing, and
SRGM analysis for better reproducibility. Overall, we found good applicability
of SRGMs to OSS, but with different performance when segmenting the dataset
into releases and domains, highlighting the difficulty in generalizing the
findings and in the search for one-fits-all models.

many scientific fields, ideally addressed by experimental studies. However,
obtaining data under intervention scenarios may not always be feasible, while
discovering causal relations from purely observational data is notoriously
challenging. In certain settings, such as genomics, we may have data from
heterogeneous study conditions, with soft (partial) interventions only
pertaining to a subset of the study variables, whose effects and targets are
possibly unknown. Combining data from experimental and observational studies
offers the opportunity to leverage both domains and improve on the
identifiability of causal structures. To this end, we define the interventional
BGe score for a mixture of observational and interventional data, where the
targets and effects of intervention may be unknown. To demonstrate the approach
we compare its performance to other state-of-the-art algorithms, both in
simulations and data analysis applications. Prerogative of our method is that
it takes a Bayesian perspective leading to a full characterisation of the
posterior distribution of the DAG structures. Given a sample of DAGs one can
also automatically derive full posterior distributions of the intervention

  Services: Safe and Trustworthy",,,,"cs.CV cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial attack perturbs an image with an imperceptible noise, leading to
incorrect model prediction. Recently, a few works showed inherent bias
associated with such attack (robustness bias), where certain subgroups in a
dataset (e.g. based on class, gender, etc.) are less robust than others. This
bias not only persists even after adversarial training, but often results in
severe performance discrepancies across these subgroups. Existing works
characterize the subgroup's robustness bias by only checking individual
sample's proximity to the decision boundary. In this work, we argue that this
measure alone is not sufficient and validate our argument via extensive
experimental analysis. It has been observed that adversarial attacks often
corrupt the high-frequency components of the input image. We, therefore,
propose a holistic approach for quantifying adversarial vulnerability of a
sample by combining these different perspectives, i.e., degree of model's
reliance on high-frequency features and the (conventional) sample-distance to
the decision boundary. We demonstrate that by reliably estimating adversarial
vulnerability at the sample level using the proposed holistic metric, it is
possible to develop a trustworthy system where humans can be alerted about the
incoming samples that are highly likely to be misclassified at test time. This
is achieved with better precision when our holistic metric is used over
individual measures. To further corroborate the utility of the proposed
holistic approach, we perform knowledge distillation in a limited-sample
setting. We observe that the student network trained with the subset of samples
selected using our combined metric performs better than both the competing
baselines, viz., where samples are selected randomly or based on their
distances to the decision boundary.

This work combines experimental data on optical properties from a variety of

shows that strong electron-phonon interaction leads to a significant blue shift

states by light absorption with respect to the thermodynamic charge transition

for programmable matter consisting of tiny, robotic elements called amoebots.
We consider the reconfigurable circuit extension [Feldmann et al., JCB 2022] of
the geometric (variant of the) amoebot model that allows the amoebot structure
to interconnect amoebots by so-called circuits. A circuit permits the
instantaneous transmission of signals between the connected amoebots. In this
paper, we examine the structural power of the reconfigurable circuits.
  We start with some fundamental problems like the stripe computation problem
where, given any connected amoebot structure $S$, an amoebot $u$ in $S$, and
some axis $X$, all amoebots belonging to axis $X$ through $u$ have to be
identified. Second, we consider the global maximum problem, which identifies an
amoebot at the highest possible position with respect to some direction in some
given amoebot (sub)structure. A solution to this problem can then be used to
solve the skeleton problem, where a (not necessarily simple) cycle of amoebots
has to be found in the given amoebot structure which contains all boundary
amoebots. A canonical solution to that problem can then be used to come up with
a canonical path, which provides a unique characterization of the shape of the
given amoebot structure. Constructing canonical paths for different directions
will then allow the amoebots to set up a spanning tree and to check symmetry
properties of the given amoebot structure.
  The problems are important for a number of applications like rapid shape
transformation, energy dissemination, and structural monitoring. Interestingly,
the reconfigurable circuit extension allows polylogarithmic-time solutions to
all of these problems.

of the emerging semantic transmission and the conventional bit-based
transmission in future networks. The semantic rate is considered for measuring
the performance of the semantic transmission. However, a key challenge is that
there is a lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter, namely the
semantic similarity, which characterizes the sentence similarity between an
original sentence and the corresponding recovered sentence. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a data regression method, where the semantic similarity
is approximated by a generalized logistic function. Using the obtained
tractable function, we propose a heterogeneous semantic and bit communication
framework, where an access point simultaneously sends the semantic and bit
streams to one semantics-interested user (S-user) and one bit-interested user
(B-user). To realize this heterogeneous semantic and bit transmission in
multi-user networks, three MA schemes are proposed, namely orthogonal multiple
access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and semi-NOMA. More
specifically, the bit stream in semi-NOMA is split into two streams, one is
transmitted with the semantic stream over the shared frequency sub-band and the
other is transmitted over the separate orthogonal frequency sub-band. To study
the fundamental performance limits of the three proposed MA schemes, the
semantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region and the power region are defined. An
optimal resource allocation procedure is then derived for characterizing the
boundary of the SvB rate region and the power region achieved by each MA
scheme. The structures of the derived solutions demonstrate that semi-NOMA is
superior to both NOMA and OMA given its highly flexible transmission policy.
Our numerical results validate the analysis and show the superiority of
semi-NOMA.

their AVs operate safer than human drivers. This in turn creates the need to
estimate and model the collision rate (failure rate) of an AV taking all
possible errors and driving situations into account. In other words, there is
the strong demand for comprehensive Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) models for
AVs. In this paper, we will introduce such a generic and scalable model that
creates a link between errors in the perception system to vehicle-level
failures (collisions). Using this model, we are able to derive requirements for
the perception quality based on the desired vehicle-level MTBF or vice versa to
obtain an MTBF value given a certain mission profile and perception quality.

However, we find strikingly different current fluctuations for these two

explained by the complementary information revealed by measurements in

regime, the induced dipole moment scales as $z_0^{-2}$, where $z_0$ is the
elevation of probe above the 2DES. Both for Drude and classical ballistic
regimes of conduction, the dipole moment scales as $z_0^{-3}$. In the former
case, the dipole moment is carrier density-independent, while in the latter it
largely depends on carrier density. More generally, we find that the induced

structure calculations due to its favourable computational cost despite the
fact that it usually fails to describe strongly correlated systems. A
particularly promising approach to overcome those difficulties is reduced
density matrix functional theory (RDMFT): It abandons the complexity of the
$N$-particle wave function and at the same time explicitly allows for
fractional occupation numbers. It is the goal of this thesis to initiate and
establish a bosonic RDMFT for both ground state and excited state energy
calculations. Motivated by the Onsager and Penrose criterion which identifies
RDMFT as a particularly suitable approach to describe Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), we derive the universal functional for a homogeneous BEC in the
Bogoliubov regime. Remarkably, the gradient of the universal functional is
found to diverge repulsively in the regime of complete condensation. This
introduces the new concept of a BEC force, which provides a universal
explanation for quantum depletion since it is merely based on the geometry of
quantum states. In the second part of the thesis, we propose and work out an
ensemble RDMFT targeting excitations in bosonic quantum systems. This endeavour
further highlights the potential of convex analysis for the development of
functional theories in the future. Indeed by resorting to several concepts from
convex analysis, we succeeded to provide a comprehensive foundation of
$\boldsymbol{w}$-ensemble RDMFT for bosons which is further based on a
generalization of the Ritz variational principle and a constrained search
formalism. In particular, we solve the emerging $N$-representability problem
leading to a generalization of Pauli's famous exclusion principle to bosonic
mixed states.

emitted by PBH mergers, if the signals can be distinguished from those produced
by the merging of astrophysical black holes. In this work, we forecast the
capability of the Einstein Telescope, a proposed third-generation GW
observatory, to identify and measure the abundance of a subdominant population
of distant PBHs, using the difference in the redshift evolution of the merger
rate of the two populations as our discriminant. We carefully model the merger
rates and generate realistic mock catalogues of the luminosity distances and
errors that would be obtained from GW signals observed by the Einstein
Telescope. We use two independent statistical methods to analyse the mock data,
finding that, with our more powerful, likelihood-based method, PBH abundances
as small as $f_\mathrm{PBH} \approx 7 \times 10^{-6}$ ($f_\mathrm{PBH} \approx
2\times10^{-6}$) would be distinguishable from $f_\mathrm{PBH} = 0$ at the
level of $3\sigma$ with a one year (ten year) observing run of the Einstein
Telescope. Our mock data generation code, darksirens, is fast, easily
extendable and publicly available on GitLab.

it possible to discover the SDE model that best describes the data. Here, we
present PyDaddy (PYthon library for DAta Driven DYnamics), a toolbox to
construct and analyze interpretable SDE models based on time-series data. We
combine traditional approaches for data-driven SDE reconstruction with an
equation learning approach, to derive symbolic equations governing the
stochastic dynamics. The toolkit is presented as an open-source Python library,
and consists of tools to construct and analyze SDEs. Functionality is included
for visual examination of the stochastic structure of the data, guided
extraction of the functional form of the SDE, and diagnosis and debugging of
the underlying assumptions and the extracted model. Using simulated time-series
datasets, exhibiting a wide range of dynamics, we show that PyDaddy is able to
correctly identify underlying SDE models. We demonstrate the applicability of
the toolkit to real-world data using a previously published movement data of a
fish school. Starting from the time-series of the observed polarization of the
school, pyDaddy readily discovers the SDE model governing the dynamics of group
polarization. The model recovered by PyDaddy is consistent with the previous

We address this problem using a minimal model of interacting multi-species

behavior with multiple regimes that go beyond the classical 'niche' and
'neutral' regimes, extending and modifying the 'neutral-like' or 'niche-like'

as either 'niche' or 'neutral' where a multimodal species abundance
distribution is observed. We characterize the transitions between the different

noisy competitive ecological systems, against which more complex models that
include factors such as mutations and environmental noise can be compared.

of infections on graphs. In this model, vertices are either susceptible,
infected, or recovered. Each infected vertex becomes recovered at rate 1 and
infects each of its susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\lambda$, and
each recovered vertex becomes susceptible at a rate $\varrho$, which we assume
to be independent of the graph size. A central quantity of the SIRS process is
the time until no vertex is infected, known as the survival time. Surprisingly
though, rigorous theoretical results exist only for the related SIS model so
far.
  We address this imbalance by conducting theoretical analyses of the SIRS
process via their expansion properties. We prove that the expected survival
time of the SIRS process on stars is at most polynomial in the graph size for
any value of $\lambda$. This behavior is fundamentally different from the SIS
process, where the expected survival time is exponential already for small
infection rates.
  Our main result is an exponential lower bound of the expected survival time
of the SIRS process on expander graphs. Specifically, we show that on expander
graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices, degree close to $d$, and sufficiently small
spectral expansion, the SIRS process has expected survival time at least
exponential in $n$ when $\lambda \geq c/d$ for a constant $c > 1$. Previous
results on the SIS process show that this bound is almost tight. Additionally,
our result holds even if $G$ is a subgraph. Notably, our result implies an
almost-tight threshold for Erdos-R\'enyi graphs and a regime of exponential
survival time for hyperbolic random graphs. The proof of our main result draws
inspiration from Lyapunov functions used in mean-field theory to devise a
two-dimensional potential function and applying a negative-drift theorem to
show that the expected survival time is exponential.

for plugging in visual controls in the generation process and enabling LMs to
perform multimodal tasks (e.g., image captioning) in a zero-shot manner. MAGIC
is a simple yet efficient plug-and-play framework, which directly combines an
off-the-shelf LM (i.e., GPT-2) and an image-text matching model (i.e., CLIP)
for image-grounded text generation. During decoding, MAGIC influences the
generation of the LM by introducing a CLIP-induced score, called magic score,
which regularizes the generated result to be semantically related to a given
image while being coherent to the previously generated context. Notably, the
proposed decoding scheme does not involve any gradient update operation,
therefore being computationally efficient. On the challenging task of zero-shot
image captioning, MAGIC outperforms the state-of-the-art method by notable
margins with a nearly 27 times decoding speedup. MAGIC is a flexible framework

technical drawings using classical detection and object character recognition
(OCR) tools is mainly due to the limited number of technical drawings and the
captcha-like structure of the contents. Text is often combined with unknown
symbols and interruptions by lines. Additionally, due to intellectual property
rights and technical know-how issues, there are no out-of-the box training
datasets available in the literature to train such models. This paper combines
a domain knowledge-based generator to generate realistic technical drawings
with a state-of-the-art object detection model to solve the issue of detecting

in a large variety and can be considered as a data augmentation generator.
These artificial drawings are used for training, while the model is tested on
real data. The authors show that artificially generated data of technical

hierarchical Bayesian deep learning model, dubbed mismatch localization
variational autoencoder (ML-VAE), which decomposes the generative process of
the speech into hierarchically structured latent variables, indicating the

dynamics, which in turn imprints onto the amplitude and phase modulations of
the gravitational waves emitted by the binary. Recently, the spin precession

equations and construct, for the first time, analytic expressions for the time-
and frequency-domain gravitational waves emitted in the quasi-circular inspiral
of spin-precessing black hole binaries in a modified theory of gravity using
the post-Newtonian approximation. Working within the small coupling
approximation and using multiple scale analysis, we show that the corrections
to the nutation phase enter at relative 1PN order, and the corrections to the
precession angle and Thomas phase enter at relative 0PN order. Making use of
the stationary phase approximation and shifted uniform asymptotics, we find
that the Fourier phase of the waveform is characterized by three modifications,
two due to the back-reaction of the precession dynamics onto the spin-orbit and
spin-spin couplings that enter at 1.5PN and 2PN orders, and a 2PN modification
due to the emission of dipole radiation. We also find that back-reaction of the
precession dynamics forces the dCS corrections to the Fourier amplitude to
enter at 0PN order, as opposed to 2PN order, as expected for spin-aligned
binaries. Our work lays the first foundational stones to build an

coupling regime features mixing, the state of the network when the phases (but
not velocities) of all oscillators are distributed uniformly around the unit
circle. We study patterns, which emerge when mixing loses stability under the
variation of the strength of coupling. We identify a pitchfork (PF) and an
Andronov-Hopf (AH) bifurcations in the model with multimodal intrinsic
frequency distributions. To this effect, we use a combination of the linear
stability analysis and Penrose diagrams, a geometric technique for studying
stability of mixing. We show that the type of a bifurcation and a nascent
spatiotemporal pattern depend on the interplay of the qualitative properties of
the intrinsic frequency distribution and network connectivity.

and scale-invariance of these events. But more importantly, such predictions
are hard to {\it assess}: depending on the choice of what to predict, the
results can be very different and not easily compared. Furthermore, forecasting
models may be trained with various generic metrics which ignore some important
specificities of the problem at hand, in our case seismic risk. Finally, these
models often do not provide a clear strategy regarding the best way to use
these predictions in practice. Here we introduce a framework that allows to
design, evaluate and compare not only predictors but also decision-making
policies: a model seismically active {\it city} subjected to the crackling

to study the population of KnitCity, introducing a policy through which the
mayor of the town can decide to either keep people in, which in case of large

policy only relies on past seismic observations. We construct efficient

high-resolution images are to be obtained. To solve this problem, we developed
temporally variable-resolution illumination patterns, replacing the
conventional uniform-resolution illumination patterns with a sequence of

variable-resolution structure to develop temporally and spatially

The method using TSV illumination patterns has better imaging quality in ROI

CGI under the same number of measurements. We also experimentally verify that
the method using TSV patterns have better imaging performance when applied to

reason for this unexpected result is that all losses let the network focus on
similar image regions or properties. In this paper, we investigate this by
conducting a two-step analysis to extract and compare the learned visual
features of the same model architecture trained with different loss functions:
First, we compare the learned features on the pixel level by correlating
saliency maps of the same input images. Second, we compare the clustering of
embeddings for several image properties, e.g. object color or illumination. To
provide independent control over these properties, photo-realistic 3D car
renders similar to images in the Cars196 dataset are generated. In our
analysis, we compare 14 pretrained models from a recent study and find that,
even though all models perform similarly, different loss functions can guide
the model to learn different features. We especially find differences between
classification and ranking based losses. Our analysis also shows that some
seemingly irrelevant properties can have significant influence on the resulting
embedding. We encourage researchers from the deep metric learning community to
use our methods to get insights into the features learned by their proposed
methods.

We focus on cells' response to multiple cues, specifically on the surprising

weaker than the response to the individual cues. We systematically build
candidate signaling networks one node at a time, using the ubiquitous
ingredients of (i) up- or down-regulation, (ii) molecular conversion, or (iii)

experimentally, the adiabatic non-Hermitian Berry phase is a purely geometrical
effect that leads to significant amplification and damping of the amplitude
also for non-cyclical paths within the parameter space even when all
eigenenergies are real. We further observe a non-Hermitian analog of the
Aharonov--Bohm solenoid effect, observing amplification and attenuation when
encircling a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry that serves as a source
of imaginary flux. This experiment demonstrates the importance of geometrical

crucial for many quantum information processing tasks. In this paper, we
propose a fast and robust scheme for population transfer which combines
invariant-based inverse engineering and geometric formalism for robust quantum
control. Our scheme is not constrained by the adiabatic condition and therefore
can be implemented fast. It can also effectively suppress the dominant noise in
spin systems, which together with the fast feature guarantees the accuracy of
the population transfer. Moreover, the control parameters of the driving
Hamiltonian in our scheme are easy to design because they correspond to the
curvature and torsion of a three-dimensional visual space curve derived by
using geometric formalism for robust quantum control. We test the efficiency of
our scheme by numerically simulating the ground-state population transfer in
$^{15}$N nitrogen vacancy centers and comparing our scheme with stimulated
Raman transition, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and conventional shortcuts
to adiabaticity based schemes, three types of popularly used schemes for
population transfer. The numerical results clearly show that our scheme is
advantageous over these previous ones.

transition from the quasiperiodic order towards disorder, we show a gradual
degradation of spin-waves fractal spectra and closing of the frequency gaps. In

each addressing the environment's challenges. The proposed ML pipeline first
reduces the data dimensionality by feature selection techniques and then
incorporates time correlations by extracting time-based features. The resultant
features are fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) of low-complexity that

generic functions of thermodynamic pressure, local temperature, and vapour
composition, (ii) the Grossmann-Lohse theory for thermal convection can be
applied to the liquid and gas layers separately, (iii) the vapour content in

this setting using direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a parameter space

behavior models typically use a two-stage architecture, which extracts visual
embeddings of images through off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
in the first stage, and then jointly trains a CTR model with those visual

sub-optimal for CTR prediction. Meanwhile, precisely labeled categories in

step for updating the dual variable can be further relaxed with a step size in
$(0,2)$, and this advantage can easily lead to numerical acceleration for the
ALM. When a separable convex programming problem is discussed and a
corresponding splitting version of the classic ALM is considered, convergence
may not be guaranteed and thus it is seemingly impossible that a step size in

hydrates of the form (OH)$^{-}$(H$_{2}$O)$_{n}$ are formed. The hydrates
continuously grow in the cold environment to become macroscopic ice grains.
These ice grains are negatively charged as a result of electron impact and so
continue to attract water molecules. Because hydroxide is a negative ion,

dark-matter theories, while the predictions for MOND-like theories are
distinctly different, if the various observational issues can be overcome. Here
we provide an updated version of our 2019 study using the recent GAIA EDR3 data
release: we select a large sample of 73 159 candidate wide binary stars with
distance <300 parsec and magnitudes G<17 from GAIA EDR3, and estimate component
masses using a main-sequence mass-luminosity relation. We then examine the
frequency distribution of pairwise relative projected velocity (relative to
circular-orbit value) as a function of projected separation, compared to
simulations; as before, these distributions show a clear peak at a value close
to Newtonian expectations, along with a long 'tail' which extends to much
larger velocity ratios and may well be caused by hierarchical triple systems
with an unresolved or unseen third star. We then fit these observed
distributions with a simulated mixture of binary, triple and flyby populations,
for GR or MOND orbits, and find that standard gravity is somewhat preferred
over one specific implementation of MOND; though we have not yet explored the
full parameter space of triple population models and MOND versions. Improved
data from future GAIA releases, and followup of a subset of systems to better

using deep neural networks (DNNs). FMIM is a particular case of content-based
image retrieval (CBIR). The main challenge in FMIM compared to the general case
of CBIR, is that the subject to whom a query image belongs may be affected by
aging and progressive degenerative disorders, making it difficult to match data
on a subject level. CBIR with DNNs is generally solved by minimizing a ranking
loss, such as Triplet loss (TL), computed on image representations extracted by
a DNN from the original data. TL, in particular, operates on triplets: anchor,
positive (similar to anchor) and negative (dissimilar to anchor). Although TL
has been shown to perform well in many CBIR tasks, it still has limitations,
which we identify and analyze in this work. In this paper, we introduce (i) the
AdaTriplet loss -- an extension of TL whose gradients adapt to different
difficulty levels of negative samples, and (ii) the AutoMargin method -- a
technique to adjust hyperparameters of margin-based losses such as TL and our
proposed loss dynamically. Our results are evaluated on two large-scale
benchmarks for FMIM based on the Osteoarthritis Initiative and Chest X-ray-14

analysis, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis for
pathologists or be used for disease screening. The whole slide pathological
image can reach one gigapixel and contains abundant tissue feature information,
which needs to be divided into a lot of patches in the training and inference
stages. This will lead to a long convergence time and large memory consumption.
Furthermore, well-annotated data sets are also in short supply in the field of
digital pathology. Inspired by the pathologist's clinical diagnosis process, we
propose a weakly supervised deep reinforcement learning framework, which can
greatly reduce the time required for network inference. We use neural network
to construct the search model and decision model of reinforcement learning
agent respectively. The search model predicts the next action through the image
features of different magnifications in the current field of view, and the
decision model is used to return the predicted probability of the current field
of view image. In addition, an expert-guided model is constructed by
multi-instance learning, which not only provides rewards for search model, but
also guides decision model learning by the knowledge distillation method.
Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve fast inference
and accurate prediction of whole slide images without any pixel-level

their potential to ameliorate both the ultraviolet and infrared behavior of

provide a viable mechanism to explain the late time cosmic acceleration so as
to avoid the introduction of any form of unknown dark energy. On the other
hand, these models represent a natural link towards quantum gravity. Here, we
study a scalar-tensor equivalent model of General Relativity corrected with
non-local terms, where corrections are selected by the existence of Noether
symmetries. After performing the weak field limit and generalizing the results
to extended mass distributions, we analyse the non-local model at galaxy

lensing observations from the CLASH program. We obtain agreement with data at
the same level of statistical significance as General Relativity. We also

protocols against collective noise are presented. One is against

qubits, act as traveling states combating collective noise.
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs, which play the role of private quantum key, are
securely shared between two participants over a collective-noise channel in
advance. Through encryption and decryption with private quantum key, the
initial state of each traveling two-photon logical qubit is privately shared
between two participants. Due to quantum encryption sharing of the initial
state of each traveling logical qubit, the issue of information leakage is
overcome. The private quantum key can be repeatedly used after rotation as long
as the rotation angle is properly chosen, making quantum resource economized.
As a result, their information-theoretical efficiency is nearly up to 66.7%.
The proposed QD protocols only need single-photon measurements rather than
two-photon joint measurements for quantum measurements. Security analysis shows
that an eavesdropper cannot obtain anything useful about secret messages during
the dialogue process without being discovered. Furthermore, the proposed QD
protocols can be implemented with current techniques in experiment.

decomposition and partitions the symmetrized adjacency graph recursively into
several non-overlapping partitions via a p-way vertex separator, where p is an
integer multiple of the total number of MPI processes. From a numerical
perspective, parGeMSLR builds a Schur complement approximate inverse
preconditioner as the sum between the matrix inverse of the interface coupling

computation of the approximate inverse matrices, parGeMSLR exploits a
multilevel partitioning of the algebraic domain. The parGeMSLR library is
implemented on top of the Message Passing Interface and can solve both real and

MARS can have the capability to share the same modulated optical signal for the

station and enabling the transfer system to have the multiple-access
capability. At the same time, we for the first time theoretically model the
effect of the MARS position on the fractional frequency instability of the
fiber-optic RF transfer, demonstrating that the MARS position has little effect
on system's performance when the ratio of the front and rear fiber sub-links is
around $1:1$. We experimentally demonstrate a 1 GHz signal transfer by using
one MARS connecting 260 and 280 km fiber links with the fractional frequency
instabilities of less than $5.9\times10^{-14}$ at 1 s and $8.5\times10^{-17}$
at 10,000 s at the remote site and of $5.6\times10^{-14}$ and

propose a linear programming-based matheuristic for tri-objective binary

existing matheuristic method for tri-objective integer programming. In an
extensive computational study, we show that our method generates a better
approximation of the true Pareto front than the benchmark method on a large set

a potentially fractional lower bound set, it may also be used as a primal

and plentiful technologies have achieved good performances. As we all know, the
flow at a citywide level is in a mixed state with several basic patterns (e.g.,
commuting, working, and commercial) caused by the city area functional
distributions (e.g., developed commercial areas, educational areas and parks).
However, existing technologies have been criticized for their lack of
considering the differences in the flow patterns among regions since they want
to build only one comprehensive model to learn the mixed flow tensors.
Recognizing this limitation, we present a new perspective on flow prediction
and propose an explainable framework named ST-ExpertNet, which can adopt every
spatial-temporal model and train a set of functional experts devoted to
specific flow patterns. Technically, we train a bunch of experts based on the
Mixture of Experts (MoE), which guides each expert to specialize in different
kinds of flow patterns in sample spaces by using the gating network. We define
several criteria, including comprehensiveness, sparsity, and preciseness, to
construct the experts for better interpretability and performances. We conduct
experiments on a wide range of real-world taxi and bike datasets in Beijing and

our ST-ExpertNet successfully disentangles the city's mixed flow tensors along

engineering applications, often require significant time and compute power to
predict flow properties. The high computational cost associated with CFD
simulations significantly restricts the scope of design space exploration and
limits their use in planning and operational control. To address this issue,
machine learning (ML) based surrogate models have been proposed as a
computationally efficient tool to accelerate CFD simulations. However, a lack
of clarity about CFD data requirements often challenges the widespread adoption
of ML-based surrogates among design engineers and CFD practitioners. In this
work, we propose an ML-based surrogate model to predict the temperature
distribution inside the cabin of a passenger vehicle under various operating
conditions and use it to demonstrate the trade-off between prediction
performance and training dataset size. Our results show that the prediction
accuracy is high and stable even when the training size is gradually reduced
from 2000 to 200. The ML-based surrogates also reduce the compute time from ~30
minutes to around ~9 milliseconds. Moreover, even when only 50 CFD simulations
are used for training, the temperature trend (e.g., locations of hot/cold
regions) predicted by the ML-surrogate matches quite well with the results from
CFD simulations.

rarely address three challenges: 1) how to represent the intricate semantic
intentions of mobility inexpensively; 2) complex and weak spatial-temporal
dependencies due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the trajectory data; 3)
route selection preferences and their correlation to driving behavior. In this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion model, DouFu, for trajectory
representation joint learning, which applies multimodal learning and attention
fusion module to capture the internal characteristics of trajectories. We first
design movement, route, and global features generated from the trajectory data
and urban functional zones and then analyze them respectively with the
attention encoder or feed forward network. The attention fusion module
incorporates route features with movement features to create a better
spatial-temporal embedding. With the global semantic feature, DouFu produces a
comprehensive embedding for each trajectory. We evaluate representations
generated by our method and other baseline models on classification and
clustering tasks. Empirical results show that DouFu outperforms other models in
most of the learning algorithms like the linear regression and the support
vector machine by more than 10%.

built on ideas from autoencoder for reducing redundancy in time series, latent
predictive coding for capturing temporal dependence in MTS, and randomized
perturbation for avoiding overfitting of anomalous dependence in the training

  Machine Intelligence)",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent engineering developments in specialised computational hardware,
data-acquisition and storage technology have seen the emergence of Machine
Learning (ML) as a powerful form of data analysis with widespread applicability
beyond its historical roots in the design of autonomous agents. However --
possibly because of its origins in the development of agents capable of
self-discovery -- relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction
between people and ML. In this paper we are concerned with the use of ML in
automated or semi-automated tools that assist one or more human decision
makers. We argue that requirements on both human and machine in this context
are significantly different to the use of ML either as part of autonomous
agents for self-discovery or as part statistical data analysis. Our principal
position is that the design of such human-machine systems should be driven by
repeated, two-way intelligibility of information rather than one-way
explainability of the ML-system's recommendations. Iterated rounds of
intelligible information exchange, we think, will characterise the kinds of
collaboration that will be needed to understand complex phenomena for which
neither man or machine have complete answers. We propose operational principles
-- we call them Intelligibility Axioms -- to guide the design of a
collaborative decision-support system. The principles are concerned with: (a)
what it means for information provided by the human to be intelligible to the
ML system; and (b) what it means for an explanation provided by an ML system to
be intelligible to a human. Using examples from the literature on the use of ML
for drug-design and in medicine, we demonstrate cases where the conditions of
the axioms are met. We describe some additional requirements needed for the
design of a truly collaborative decision-support system.

upon the following generalizations: (i) the regularization procedure can be
separated into disjoint groups with different weights, (ii) neurons or full
layers may form groups, and (iii) the regularizer takes various generalized
forms of the $\ell_1$ norm. This result provides the proof for the
architectural generalizations of Cazenavette et al. (2021), including (iv) an
approximation of the complete architecture as a shallow sparse coding network.
Due to this approximation, we settled to experimenting with shallow networks
and studied their robustness against the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method on
a synthetic dataset and MNIST. We introduce classification based on the
$\ell_2$ norms of the groups and show numerically that it can be accurate and
offers considerable speedups. In this family, linear transformer shows the best
performance. Based on the theoretical results and the numerical simulations, we
