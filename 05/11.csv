fermionic reservoirs is a paradigmatic problem in quantum many-body physics.
While historically the focus has been on the equilibrium properties of the
impurity-reservoir system, recent experiments with mesoscopic and cold-atomic
systems enabled studies of highly non-equilibrium impurity models, which
require novel theoretical techniques. We propose an approach to analyze
impurity dynamics based on the matrix-product state (MPS) representation of the
Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF). The efficiency of such a MPS
representation rests on the moderate value of the temporal entanglement (TE)
entropy of the IF, viewed as a fictitious ""wave function"" in the time domain.
We obtain explicit expressions of this wave function for a family of
one-dimensional reservoirs, and analyze the scaling of TE with the evolution
time for different reservoir's initial states. While for initial states with
short-range correlations we find temporal area-law scaling, Fermi-sea-type
initial states yield logarithmic scaling with time, closely related to the
real-space entanglement scaling in critical 1d systems. Furthermore, we
describe an efficient algorithm for converting the explicit form of the
reservoirs' IF to MPS form. Once the IF is encoded by a MPS, arbitrary temporal
correlation functions of the interacting impurity can be efficiently computed,
irrespective of its internal structure. The approach introduced here can be
applied to a number of experimental setups, including highly non-equilibrium
transport via quantum dots and real-time formation of impurity-reservoir
correlations.

will induce distortion into the joint parameter posterior distribution by

minimize the distortion in the posterior distribution induced by likelihood

techniques are either computationally expensive or ineffective in practice. To
this end, we introduce a novel notion of non-separable~group, defined as a

iteratively, detects and merges non-separable groups into single qubits. It

this work, the development of high-quality thin films of PdCoO$_2$ has enabled
a thorough study of the conductivity as a function of film thickness using both
dc transport and time-domain THz spectroscopy. With increasing film thickness
from 12 nm to 102 nm, the residual resistivity decreases and we observe a large
deviation from Matthiessen's rule (DMR) in the temperature dependence of the
resistivity. We find that the complex THz conductivity is well fit by a single
Drude term. We fit the data to extract the spectral weight and scattering rate
simultaneously. The temperature dependence of the Drude scattering rate is
found to be nearly independent of the residual resistivity and cannot be the
primary mechanism for the observed DMR. Rather, we observe large changes in the
spectral weight as a function of disorder, changing by a factor of 1.5 from the
most disordered to least disordered films. We believe this corresponds to a
mass enhancement of $\geq 2$ times the value of the bulk effective mass which
increases with residual disorder. This suggests that the mechanism behind the
DMR observed in dc resistivity is primarily driven by changes in the electron
mass. We discuss the possible origins of this behavior including the
possibility of disorder-enhanced electron-phonon scattering, which can be
systematically tuned by film thickness.

However, this dichotomy does not map perfectly to the two progenitor channels
that are known to produce GRBs -- the merger of compact objects (merger-GRBs)
or the collapse of massive stars (collapsar-GRBs). In particular, the
merger-GRBs population may also include bursts with a short, hard $\lesssim$2s

discovery of a kilonova -- the radioactive glow of heavy elements made in
neutron star mergers -- in the 50s-duration GRB 211211A further demonstrates
that mergers can drive long, complex GRBs that mimic the collapsar population.

Tackling the disease by providing the necessary resources to the affected is of

trivial task given the number of factors which determine the requirement. This
issue can be addressed by predicting the probability that an infected patient
requires Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support and the importance of each of the
factors that influence it. Moreover, to assist the doctors in determining the
patients at high risk of fatality, the probability of death is also calculated.
For determining both the patient outcomes (ICU admission and death), a novel

to link these quantitative metrics to patient outcomes. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is shown by testing it on an internally curated dataset,

(first-order) approximation of the solution set as well as in formulating
optimality conditions for mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints

  The approach here followed characterizes solutions as zeros (or global

to achieve the main results the traditional employment of the KKM theory is
replaced by proper conditions on the slope of the merit functions. In turn, to

on different data resources, this non-motorized mode of transportation was
still negatively affected by the pandemic (i.e., relative reduction in

COVID-19 pandemic on the numbers and duration of trips conducted through a

  Control",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Building on our recent work on {\em neuromimetic control theory}, new results
on resilience and neuro-inspired quantization are reported. The term
neuromimetic refers to the models having features that are characteristic of
the neurobiology of biological motor control. As in previous work, the focus is
on what we call {\em overcomplete} linear systems that are characterized by
larger numbers of input and output channels than the dimensions of the state.
The specific contributions of the present paper include a proposed {\em
resilient} observer whose operation tolerates output channel intermittency and
even complete dropouts. Tying these ideas together with our previous work on
resilient stability, a resilient separation principle is established. We also
propose a {\em principled quantization} in which control signals are encoded as
simple discrete inputs which act collectively through the many channels of
input that are the hallmarks of the overcomplete models. Aligned with the
neuromimetic paradigm, an {\em emulation} problem is proposed and this in turn
defines an optimal quantization problem. Several possible solutions are
discussed including direct combinatorial optimization, a Hebbian-like iterative
learning algorithm, and a deep Q-learning (DQN) approach. For the problems
being considered, machine learning approaches to optimization provide valuable
insights regarding comparisons between optimal and nearby suboptimal solutions.
These are useful in understanding the kinds of resilience to intermittency and
channel dropouts that were earlier demonstrated for continuous systems.

understanding the development of the nervous system and for creating biomimetic

controls the network formation is the growth of an axon from the cell body and
its extension towards target neurons. Axonal growth is directed by
environmental stimuli that include intercellular interactions, biochemical
cues, and the mechanical and geometrical properties of the growth substrate.
Despite significant recent progress, the steering of the growing axon remains
poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a model of axonal motility, which
incorporates substrate-geometry sensing. We combine experimental data with
theoretical analysis to measure the parameters that describe axonal growth on
micropatterned surfaces: diffusion (cell motility) coefficients, speed and
angular distributions, and cell-substrate interactions. Experiments performed
on neurons treated with inhibitors for microtubules (Taxol) and actin filaments
(Y-27632) indicate that cytoskeletal dynamics play a critical role in the
steering mechanism. Our results demonstrate that axons follow geometrical
patterns through a contact-guidance mechanism, in which geometrical patterns
impart high traction forces to the growth cone. These results have important
implications for bioengineering novel substrates to guide neuronal growth and
promote nerve repair.

of intelligent transportation, especially for driving behavior analysis and
prediction. This study proposes a novel framework by integrating fuzzy
trajectory data, unsupervised learning and supervised learning methods to
predict lane-changing behaviors taking multi driving styles into account. The
microscopic trajectory data from the Highway Drone Dataset (HighD) are employed
to construct two types of datasets, including precise trajectory datasets and
fuzzy trajectory datasets for lane-changing prediction models. The fuzzy
trajectory data are developed based on different driving styles, which are
clustered by the K-means algorithm. Two typical supervised learning methods,
including random forest and long-short-term memory combined with convolutional
neural network, are further applied for lane-changing behavior prediction.
Results indicate that (1) the proposed integration approach performs better
than the conventional lane-changing prediction; (2) the relative speed-related
features have a greater contribution to the lane-changing prediction after
being processed by fuzzy rules based on driving styles; and (3) the difference
among driving styles is more reflected from the state of lateral movement
rather than the lane-changing duration.

and their increased accuracy. The mismatch between the values of the Hubble
constant $H_0$ obtained from direct distance ladder measurements and from the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the most statistically significant, but
the amplitude of the matter fluctuations is also regarded as a serious concern,
leading to the investigation of a plethora of models. We first show that the
combination of several recent measurements from local probes leads to a tight
constraint on the present-day matter density $\Omega_M$ as well as on the
amplitude of the matter fluctuations, both acceptably consistent with the
values inferred from the CMB. Secondly, we show that the data on cosmic
chronometers allow to derive an accurate value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ for
$\Lambda$CDM models: $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 1.34$ km/s/Mpc. This implies that, within
$\Lambda$CDM, some determinations of $H_0$ are biased. Considering a bias on
the Hubble constant as a nuisance parameter within $\Lambda$CDM, we examine
such a $\Lambda$CDM$+ H_0$ bias model on the same statistical grounds as
alternative cosmological models. We show that the former statistically
supersede most existing extended models proposed up to now. In a third step, we
show that the value of $\Omega_M$ we obtained, combined with $H_0$ from SH0ES,
leads to an accurate measurement of $\omega_M$, providing an additional
low-redshift test for cosmological models. From this test, most extensions seem
to be confronted with a new tension, whereas the $\Lambda$CDM with $H_0 \sim 67
$ has none. We conclude that a standard $\Lambda$CDM model with an unknown bias
in the Cepheids distance calibration represents a model that reaches a
remarkable agreement, statistically better than previously proposed extensions
with $H_0 \sim 73 $ for which such a comparison can be performed. (abridged)

development of so-called resonance-based methods for dispersive nonlinear
partial differential equations. In many situations, this new class of methods
allows for approximations in a much more general setting (e.g. for rough data)
than, for instance, classical splitting or exponential integrator methods.
However, they lack one important property: the preservation of geometric
properties of the flow. This is particularly drastic in the case of the
Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation and the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
(NLSE) which are fundamental models in the broad field of dispersive
infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, possessing infinitely many conserved
quantities, an important property which we wish to capture - at least up to
some degree - also on the discrete level. Nowadays, a wide range of structure
preserving integrators for Hamiltonian systems are available, however,
typically these existing algorithms can only approximate highly regular
solutions efficiently. State-of-the-art low-regularity integrators, on the
other hand, poorly preserve the geometric structure of the underlying PDE. In
this work we introduce a novel framework, so-called Runge-Kutta resonance-based
methods, which are able to bridge the gap between low regularity and structure
preservation in the KdV and NLSE case. In particular, we are able to
characterise a large class of symplectic (in the Hamiltonian picture)
resonance-based methods for both equations that allow for low-regularity
approximations to the solution while preserving the underlying geometric

These findings indicate that, while some general trends can be observed, the

minimizing the long-term transmission power consumption, subject to the coupled

coupled nature of the phase-shift model, the formulated problem is solved by
invoking a hybrid continuous and discrete phase-shift control policy. Inspired
by this observation, a pair of hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,
namely the hybrid deep deterministic policy gradient (hybrid DDPG) algorithm
and the joint DDPG & deep-Q network (DDPG-DQN) based algorithm are proposed.
The hybrid DDPG algorithm controls the associated high-dimensional continuous

  Environment","ApJL published version",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ac80c7",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, a kilonova-associated gamma-ray burst (GRB 211211A), whose light
curve consists of a precursor ($\sim$0.2 s), a hard spiky emission ($\sim$10
s), and a soft long extended emission ($\sim$40 s), has attracted great
attention. Kilonova association could prove its merger origin, while the
detection of the precursor can be used to infer at least one highly magnetized
neutron star (NS) being involved in the merger. In this case, a strong magnetic
flux $\Phi$ is expected to surround the central engine of GRB 211211A. Here we
suggest that when $\Phi$ is large enough, the accretion flow could be halted
far from the innermost stable radius, which will significantly prolong the
lifetime of the accretion process, and so the GRB duration. For example, we
show that as long as the central black hole (BH) is surrounded by a strong
magnetic flux $\Phi\sim 10^{29}\rm cm^{2}G$, an accretion flow with
$\dot{M}_{\rm ini} \simeq 0.1 M_\odot s^{-1}$ could be halted at 40 times the
gravitational radius and be slowly transferred into the black hole on the order
of $\sim$10 s, which naturally explains the duration of hard spiky emission.
After most of the disk mass has been accreted onto the BH, the inflow rate will
be reduced, so a long and soft extended emission is expected when a new balance
between the magnetic field and the accretion current is reconstructed at a
larger radius. Our results further support that the special behavior of GRB
211211A is mainly due to the strong magnetic field of its progenitor stars.

the data transmission of intra-subnetwork and inter-subnetwork will inevitably
interfere with each other, which poses a great challenge to radio resource
management. Moreover, most of the existing approaches require the instantaneous
channel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected.
To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent
radio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal
strength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However,
to directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible
thing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net,
which integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of
inter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and exclude the impact of
unrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head
attention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will
impact individual throughput. Experimental results prove that our proposed
framework significantly outperforms both traditional and MARL-based methods in

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants on each machine and
communicate with other machines periodically. However, SGD might converge
slowly in training some deep neural networks (e.g., RNN, LSTM) because of the
exploding gradient issue. Gradient clipping is usually employed to address this
issue in the single machine setting, but exploring this technique in the
distributed setting is still in its infancy: it remains mysterious whether the
gradient clipping scheme can take advantage of multiple machines to enjoy
parallel speedup. The main technical difficulty lies in dealing with nonconvex
loss function, non-Lipschitz continuous gradient, and skipping communication
rounds simultaneously. In this paper, we explore a relaxed-smoothness
assumption of the loss landscape which LSTM was shown to satisfy in previous
works, and design a communication-efficient gradient clipping algorithm. This
algorithm can be run on multiple machines, where each machine employs a
gradient clipping scheme and communicate with other machines after multiple
steps of gradient-based updates. Our algorithm is proved to have
$O\left(\frac{1}{N\epsilon^4}\right)$ iteration complexity and
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3})$ communication complexity for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point in the homogeneous data setting, where $N$ is the
number of machines. This indicates that our algorithm enjoys linear speedup and
reduced communication rounds. Our proof relies on novel analysis techniques of
estimating truncated random variables, which we believe are of independent
interest. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets and various scenarios
demonstrate that our algorithm indeed exhibits fast convergence speed in
practice and thus validates our theory.

transition between the photosphere where the gas is almost neutral and the
fully ionized corona. As the collisional coupling between neutral and charged
particles decreases in the upper part of the chromosphere, the hydrodynamical
timescales may become comparable to the collisional timescale, and a two-fluid
model is needed. In this paper we describe the implementation and validation of
a two-fluid model which simultaneously evolves charges and neutrals, coupled by
collisions. The two-fluid equations are implemented in the fully open-source
MPI-AMRVAC code. In the photosphere and the lower part of the solar atmosphere,
where collisions between charged and neutral particles are very frequent, an
explicit time-marching would be too restrictive, since for stability the
timestep needs to be proportional to the inverse of the collision frequency.
This is overcome by evaluating the collisional terms implicitly using an
explicit-implicit (IMEX) scheme. The cases presented cover very different
collisional regimes and our results are fully consistent with related
literature findings. If collisional time and length scales are smaller than the
hydrodynamical scales usually considered in the solar chromosphere, density
structures seen in the neutral and charged fluids are similar, with the effect
of elastic collisions between charges and neutrals being similar to
diffusivity. Otherwise, density structures are different and the decoupling in
velocity between the two species increases. The use of IMEX schemes efficiently
avoids the small timestep constraints of fully explicit implementations in
strongly collisional regimes. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) greatly decreases

of complex systems from micro-level assumptions. However, ABMs typically can
not estimate agent-specific (or ""micro"") variables: this is a major limitation
which prevents ABMs from harnessing micro-level data availability and which
greatly limits their predictive power. In this paper, we propose a protocol to
learn the latent micro-variables of an ABM from data. The first step of our
protocol is to reduce an ABM to a probabilistic model, characterized by a
computationally tractable likelihood. This reduction follows two general design
principles: balance of stochasticity and data availability, and replacement of
unobservable discrete choices with differentiable approximations. Then, our
protocol proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of the latent variables via a
gradient-based expectation maximization algorithm. We demonstrate our protocol
by applying it to an ABM of the housing market, in which agents with different
incomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods. We demonstrate
that the obtained model allows accurate estimates of the latent variables,
while preserving the general behavior of the ABM. We also show that our
estimates can be used for out-of-sample forecasting. Our protocol can be seen
as an alternative to black-box data assimilation methods, that forces the
modeler to lay bare the assumptions of the model, to think about the
inferential process, and to spot potential identification problems.

growing field of quantum information science with both theoretical and

applications is variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). These algorithms use a
classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit to accomplish
certain tasks, where the circuits are usually randomly initialized. In this
work, we prove that for a broad class of such random circuits, the variation
range of the cost function via adjusting any local quantum gate within the
circuit vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits with a high probability.
This result can unify the restrictions on gradient-based and gradient-free
optimizations in a natural manner and reveal extra harsh constraints on the
training landscapes of VQAs. Hence a fundamental limitation on the trainability
of VQAs is unraveled, indicating the essential mechanism of the optimization
hardness in the Hilbert space with exponential dimension. We further showcase
the validity of our results with numerical simulations of representative VQAs.
We believe that these results would deepen our understanding of the scalability

Accordingly, in this work we relate the interfacial properties of dilute
multicomponent solutions to the interactions between solutes. We first derive a
simple model for the surface excess of solutes in terms of thermodynamic
observables. We then develop a lattice-based statistical mechanical
perturbation theory to derive these observables from microscopic interactions.
Rather than adopting a random mixing approximation, this dilute solution theory
(DST) exactly treats solute-solute interactions to lowest order in perturbation
theory. Although it cannot treat concentrated solutions, Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations demonstrate that DST describes dilute solutions with much greater
accuracy than regular solution theory. Importantly, DST emphasizes an important
distinction between the `intrinsic' and `effective' preferences of solutes for
interfaces. DST predicts that three classes of solutes can be distinguished by
their intrinsic preference for interfaces. While the surface preference of
strong depletants are relatively insensitive to interactions, the surface
preference of strong surfactants can be modulated by interactions at the
interface. Moreover, DST predicts that the surface preference of weak
depletants and weak surfactants can be qualitatively inverted by interactions
in the bulk. We also demonstrate that DST can be extended to treat surface
polarization effects and to model experimental data. MC simulations validate
the accuracy of DST predictions for lattice systems that correspond to molar
concentrations.

degradations, which can not provide explicit supervision to the interactive
modulation during training. However, how to realize the interactive modulation

lie in the direct line-of-sight (LoS). Most objects are opaque in the optical

Current approaches to see around occlusions exploit the multireflection
propagation of signals from neighboring surfaces either in the microwave or the
optical bands. Using lower frequency signals anatomical information is limited
and images suffer from clutter while optical systems encounter diffuse
scattering from most surfaces and suffer from path loss, thus limiting the
imaging distance. In this work, we show that terahertz (THz) waves can be used
to extend visibility to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) while combining the advantages
of both spectra. The material properties and roughness of most building
surfaces allow for a unique combination of both diffuse and strong specular
scattering. As a result, most building surfaces behave as lossy mirrors that
enable propagation paths between a THz camera and the NLoS scenes. We propose a
mirror folding algorithm that tracks the multireflection propagation of THz
waves to 1) correct the image from cluttering and 2) see around occlusions
without a priori knowledge of the scene geometry and material properties. To
validate the feasibility of the proposed NLoS imaging approach, we carried out

show the capability of THz radar imaging systems to recover both the geometry

an order of magnitude more time than training their counterpart image models,
leading to long research cycles. Existing VSR methods typically train models
with fixed spatial and temporal sizes from beginning to end. The fixed sizes
are usually set to large values for good performance, resulting to slow
training. However, is such a rigid training strategy necessary for VSR? In this
work, we show that it is possible to gradually train video models from small to
large spatial/temporal sizes, i.e., in an easy-to-hard manner. In particular,
the whole training is divided into several stages and the earlier stage has
smaller training spatial shape. Inside each stage, the temporal size also
varies from short to long while the spatial size remains unchanged. Training is
accelerated by such a multigrid training strategy, as most of computation is
performed on smaller spatial and shorter temporal shapes. For further
acceleration with GPU parallelization, we also investigate the large minibatch
training without the loss in accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method is capable of largely speeding up training (up to $6.2\times$

survey of around one thousand exoplanetary atmospheres during its primary
mission life. By providing homogeneous datasets, with a high SNR and wide
wavelength coverage, Ariel will unveil the atmospheric demographics of these
far-away worlds, helping to constrain planet formation and evolution processes
on a galactic scale. Ariel seeks to undertake a statistical survey of a diverse
population of planets and, therefore, the sample of planets from which this
selection can be made is of the utmost importance. While many suitable targets
have already been found, hundreds more will be discovered before the mission is
operational. Previous studies have used predictions of exoplanet detections to
forecast the available planet population by the launch date of Ariel, with the
most recent noting that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) alone
should provide over a thousand potential targets. In this work, we consider the
planet candidates found to date by TESS to show that, with the addition of
already confirmed planets, Ariel will already have a more than sufficient
sample to choose its target list from once these candidates are validated. We
showcase the breadth of this population as well as exploring, for the first
time, the ability of Ariel to characterise multiple planets within a single

across the wider population, will undoubtedly revolutionise our understanding

recently. However, we find existing transformer based solutions regard each
pixel as a token, thus suffer from information loss issue from two aspects: 1)
They downsample the input image into much lower resolutions for efficiency
consideration, incurring information loss and extra misalignment for the
boundaries of masked regions. 2) They quantize $256^3$ RGB pixels to a small
number (such as 512) of quantized pixels. The indices of quantized pixels are
used as tokens for the inputs and prediction targets of transformer. Although
an extra CNN network is used to upsample and refine the low-resolution results,
it is difficult to retrieve the lost information back.To keep input information
as much as possible, we propose a new transformer based framework ""PUT"".
Specifically, to avoid input downsampling while maintaining the computation
efficiency, we design a patch-based auto-encoder P-VQVAE, where the encoder
converts the masked image into non-overlapped patch tokens and the decoder
recovers the masked regions from inpainted tokens while keeping the unmasked
regions unchanged. To eliminate the information loss caused by quantization, an
Un-Quantized Transformer (UQ-Transformer) is applied, which directly takes the
features from P-VQVAE encoder as input without quantization and regards the
quantized tokens only as prediction targets. Extensive experiments show that
PUT greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on image fidelity, especially
for large masked regions and complex large-scale datasets. Code is available at

$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiative transfer in spherical geometry: (1)
implementation of the correct boundary condition for a steady source, and (2)
solution of the time-dependent problem for an impulsive source. For the
steady-state problem, the solution can be represented as a sum of two terms: a
previously-known analytic solution of the equation with mean intensity $J=0$ at
the surface, and a novel, semi-analytic solution which enforces the correct
boundary condition of zero-ingoing intensity at the surface. This solution is
compared to that of the Monte Carlo method, which is valid at arbitrary optical
depth. It is shown that the size of the correction is of order unity when the
spectral peaks approach the Doppler core and decreases slowly with line center
optical depth, specifically as $(a \tau_0)^{-1/3}$, which may explain
discrepancies seen in previous studies. For the impulsive problem, the time,
spatial, and frequency dependence of the solution are expressed using an
eigenfunction expansion in order to characterize the escape time distribution
and emergent spectra of photons. It is shown that the lowest-order
eigenfrequency agrees well with the decay rate found in the Monte Carlo escape
time distribution at sufficiently large line-center optical depths. The
characterization of the escape-time distribution highlights the potential for a
Monte Carlo acceleration method, which would sample photon escape properties
from distributions rather than calculating every photon scattering, thereby
reducing computational demand.

uniform rotation of the polarization of cosmic microwave background photons,
called isotropic cosmic birefringence, has been reported. The suggested
rotation angle of polarization of about $0.2-0.4$ degrees strongly suggests
that it is determined by the fine structure constant, which can be naturally
explained over a very wide parameter range by the domain walls of axion-like
particles. Interestingly, the axion-like particle domain walls predict not only
isotropic cosmic birefringence but also anisotropic one that reflects the
spatial distribution of the axion-like particle field on the last scattering
surface. In this Letter, we perform lattice simulations of the formation and
evolution of domain walls in the expanding universe and obtain for the first
time the two-point correlation function and power spectrum of the scalar field
that constitutes the domain walls. We find that while the power spectrum is
generally consistent with analytical predictions based on random wall
distributions, there is a predominant excess on the scale corresponding to the
Hubble radius. Applying our results to the anisotropic cosmic birefringence, we
predict the power spectrum of the rotation angles induced by the axion-like
particle domain walls and show that it is within the reach of future
observations of the cosmic microwave background.

(2022),
has been shown to generalize the close-wide and inner-outer caustic
degeneracies into a unified regime of magnification degeneracy in the
interpretation of 2-body planetary microlensing observations. While the
inner-outer degeneracy expects the source trajectory to pass equidistant to the
planetary caustics of the degenerate lens configurations, the offset degeneracy
states that the same mathematical expression applies to any combination of the
close, wide, and resonant caustic topologies, where the projected star-planet
separations differ by an offset ($s_{\rm A}\neq s_{\rm B}$) that depends on
where the source trajectory crosses the star-planet axis. An important
implication is that the $s_{\rm A}=1/s_{\rm B}$ solution of the close-wide
degeneracy never strictly manifests in observations except when the source
crosses a singular point near the primary. Nevertheless, the offset degeneracy
was proposed upon numerical calculations, and no theoretical justification was
given. Here, we provide a theoretical treatment of the offset degeneracy, which
demonstrates its nature as a mathematical degeneracy. From first principles, we
show that the offset degeneracy formalism is exact to zeroth-order in the mass
ratio ($q$) for two cases: when the source crosses the lens-axis inside of
caustics, and for $(s_{\rm A}-s_{\rm B})^6\ll1$ when crossing outside of
caustics. The extent to which the offset degeneracy persists in oblique source
trajectories is explored numerically. Lastly, it is shown that the
superposition principle allows for a straightforward generalization to $N$-body
microlenses with $N-1$ planetary lens components ($q\ll1$), which results in a
$2^{N-1}$-fold degeneracy.

QED and QCD for the real world in the massless limit. In QED, while there is no
conserved Noether current for the $U(1)_\text{A}$ axial symmetry because of the
ABJ anomaly, for every rational angle $2\pi p/N$, we construct a conserved and
gauge-invariant topological symmetry operator. Intuitively, it is a composition
of the axial rotation and a fractional quantum Hall state coupled to the
electromagnetic $U(1)$ gauge field. These conserved symmetry operators do not
obey a group multiplication law, but a non-invertible fusion algebra over TQFT
coefficients. They act invertibly on all local operators as axial rotations,
but non-invertibly on the 't Hooft lines. These non-invertible symmetries lead
to selection rules, which are consistent with the scattering amplitudes in QED.
We further generalize our construction to QCD, and show that the coupling
$\pi^0 F\wedge F$ in the effective pion Lagrangian is necessary to match these
non-invertible symmetries in the UV. Therefore, the conventional argument for
the neutral pion decay using the ABJ anomaly is now rephrased as a matching
condition of a generalized global symmetry.

maximum critical temperature $T_c\approx30$~mK. Here, we show that placing
monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_{2}$) on BLG promotes Cooper pairing to an
extraordinary degree: superconductivity appears at zero magnetic field,
exhibits an order of magnitude enhancement in $T_c$, and occurs over a density
range that is wider by a factor of eight. By mapping quantum oscillations in
BLG-WSe$_2$ as a function of electric field and doping, we establish that
superconductivity emerges throughout a region whose normal state is polarized,
with two out of four spin-valley flavours predominantly populated. In-plane
magnetic field measurements further reveal a striking dependence of the
critical field on doping, with the Chandrasekhar-Clogston (Pauli) limit roughly
obeyed on one end of the superconducting dome yet sharply violated on the
other. Moreover, the superconductivity arises only for perpendicular electric
fields that push BLG hole wavefunctions towards WSe$_2$ -- suggesting that
proximity-induced (Ising) spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in enhancing the
pairing. Our results pave the way for engineering robust, highly tunable, and

symmetry. After computing several classes of OPE structure constants we were
able to find the matrices of anomalous dimensions for three classes of RG
invariant sets of local fields. Each set from the first class consists of a
single primary field, the second one of three primaries, while sets in the
third class contain six primary and four secondary fields. We diagonalize their
matrices of anomalous dimensions and establish the explicit maps between UV and
IR fields (mixing coefficients).
  While investigating the three point functions of secondary fields we have
encountered an interesting phenomenon, namely violation of holomorphic
anti-holomorphic factorization property, something that does not happen in
ordinary minimal models with Virasoro symmetry solely.
  Furthermore, the perturbation under consideration preserves a non-trivial
subgroup of $W$ transformations. We have derived the corresponding conserved
current explicitly. We used this current to define a notion of anomalous
$W$-weights in perturbed theory: the analog for matrix of anomalous dimensions.
For RG invariant sets with primary fields only we have derived a formula for
this quantity in terms of structure constants. This allowed us to compute
anomalous $W$-weights for the first and second classes explicitly.
  The same RG flow we investigate also with the domain wall approach for the
second RG invariant class and find complete agreement with the perturbative
approach.

differences in the representational geometry of high and low frequency words

of matter under the most extreme conditions. Until recently, there were few, if
any, observational constraints on the circumbinary environments of X-ray
binaries at $\sim$ 100-5000 AU scales; it remains unclear how the accretion
onto the compact objects or the explosions giving rise to the compact objects
interact with their immediate surroundings. Here, we present the first
high-contrast adaptive optics images of X-ray binaries. These observations
target all X-ray binaries within $\sim$ 3 kpc accessible with the Keck/NIRC2
vortex coronagraph. This paper focuses on one of the first key results from
this campaign: our images reveal the presence of 21 sources potentially
associated with the $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae analog high-mass X-ray binary RX
J1744.7$-$2713. By conducting different analyses - a preliminary proper motion
analysis, a color-magnitude diagram and a probability of chance alignment
calculation - we found that three of these 21 sources have a high probability
of being bound to the system. If confirmed, they would be in wide orbits
($\sim$ 450 AU to 2500 AU). While follow-up astrometric observations will be
needed in $\sim$ 5-10 years to confirm further the bound nature of these
detections, these discoveries emphasize that such observations may provide a
major breakthrough in the field. In fact, they would be useful not only for our
understanding of stellar multiplicity but also for our understanding of how
planets, brown dwarfs and stars can form even in the most extreme environments.

threshold $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ can be simulated with local hidden-variable

$\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ and relatively low dimension $d$ of the local quantum
systems. The method has two steps. First, we show a family of bipartite Bell
inequalities for which, for correlations produced by maximally entangled
states, $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ can be upper bounded by a function of some
invariants of graphs, and use it to identify correlations that require small
$\eta_{\rm{crit}}$. We present examples in which, for maximally entangled
states, $\eta_{\rm{crit}} \le 0.516$ for $d=16$, $\eta_{\rm{crit}} \le 0.407$
for $d=28$, and $\eta_{\rm{crit}} \le 0.326$ for $d=32$. We also show evidence
that the upper bound for $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ can be lowered down to $0.415$ for
$d=16$ and present a method to make the upper bound of $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$
arbitrarily small by increasing the dimension and the number of settings. All
these upper bounds for $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ are valid (as it is the case in the
literature) assuming no noise. The second step is based on the observation
that, using the initial state and measurement settings identified in the first
step, we can construct Bell inequalities with smaller $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ and
better noise robustness. For that, we use a modified version of Gilbert's
algorithm that takes advantage of the automorphisms of the graphs used in the
first step. We illustrate its power by explicitly developing an example in
which $\eta_{\rm{crit}}$ is $12.38\%$ lower and the required visibility is
$14.62\%$ lower than the upper bounds obtained in the first step. The tools
presented here may allow for developing high-dimensional loophole-free Bell
tests and loophole-free Bell nonlocality over long distances.

estimate the metallicity according to both the mass-metallicity relation (MZR)
and the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). Also, we take into account
galaxy-galaxy mergers and the evolution of the galaxy properties from the
formation to the merger of the binary compact object. We find that the merger
rate density changes dramatically depending on the choice of the star-forming
galaxy main sequence, especially in the case of binary black holes (BBHs) and
black hole neutron star systems (BHNSs). The slope of the merger rate density
of BBHs and BHNSs is steeper if we assume the MZR with respect to the FMR,
because the latter predicts a shallower decrease of metallicity with redshift.
In contrast, binary neutron stars (BNSs) are only mildly affected by both the
galaxy main sequence and metallicity relation. Overall, BBHs and BHNSs tend to
form in low-mass metal-poor galaxies and merge in high-mass metal-rich
galaxies, while BNSs form and merge in massive galaxies. We predict that
passive galaxies host at least ~5-10%, ~15-25%, and ~15-35% of all BNS, BHNS

classifying lung nodules. The necessity of high accuracy of analyzing C.T. scan
images of the lung is considered as one of the crucial challenges in detecting
and classifying lung cancer. A new long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based deep

thresholding can overcome the restrictions present in previous thresholding
methods. Extended experiments are run to assess this fusion structure by
considering 2D-GLCM computations based 2D-slices fusion, and an approximation
of this 3D-GLCM with volumetric 2.5D-GLCM computations-based LSTM fusion
structure. The proposed methods are trained and assessed through the LIDC-IDRI

diverge from the ideal TFIM under transverse magnetic fields that are far from

of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right
architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified
framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across
datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with
pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we
present a generalized & unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and
show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how
interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose
Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse
pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode
switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific
pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare
multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the
Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 & GPT-like models across multiple diverse
setups. By scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance
on 50 well-established supervised finetuning based NLP tasks. Our model also
achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on
zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot
summarization. On 0-shot MMLU, UL2 20B outperforms T0 and T5 models. UL2 20B
also works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an
appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20B
parameters. Finally, we apply FLAN instruction tuning to the UL2 20B model,
achieving MMLU and Big-Bench scores competitive to FLAN-PaLM 62B. We release
Flax-based T5X checkpoints for the UL2 20B & Flan-UL2 20B.

explore the dynamical, nonlinear regime of general relativity and constrain
modifications to it. Some of the gravitational-wave events observed by the
LIGO-Virgo Collaboration have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in the
merger, allowing us to probe the relaxation of the remnant black hole to its
final, stationary state - the so-called black-hole ringdown, which is
characterized by a set of quasinormal modes. Can we use the ringdown to
constrain deviations from general relativity, as predicted by several of its
contenders? Here, we address this question by using an inspiral-merger-ringdown
waveform model in the effective-one-body formalism, augmented with a
parametrization of the ringdown based on an expansion in the final black hole's
spin. We give a prescription on how to include in this waveform model, the
quasinormal mode frequencies calculated on a theory-by-theory basis. In
particular, we focus on theories that modify general relativity by higher-order
curvature corrections, namely, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB), dynamical
Chern-Simons (dCS) theories, and cubic- and quartic-order
effective-field-theories (EFT) of general relativity. We use this parametrized
waveform model to measure the ringdown properties of the two loudest ringdown
signals observed so far, GW150914 and GW200129. We find that while EdGB theory
cannot be constrained with these events, we can place upper bounds on the
fundamental lengthscale of cubic- ($\ell_{\rm cEFT} \leqslant 38.2$ km) and
quartic-order ($\ell_{\rm qEFT} \leqslant 51.3$ km) EFTs of general relativity,
and of dCS gravity ($\ell_{\rm dCS} \leqslant 38.7$ km). The latter result is a
concrete example of a theory presently unconstrained by inspiral-only analyses
which, however, can be constrained by merger-ringdown studies with current
gravitational-wave data.

tremendous boost to the search for sub-leading effects due to several beyond
the Standard Model scenarios in neutrino oscillation experiments. Among these,
two of the well-studied scenarios are Lorentz violation (LV) and non-standard
interactions (NSI), both of which can affect neutrino oscillations
significantly. We point out that, at a long-baseline experiment where the
neutrino oscillation probabilities can be well-approximated by using the
line-averaged constant matter density, the effects of these two scenarios can
mimic each other. This would allow the limits obtained at such an experiment on
one of the above scenarios to be directly translated to the limits on the other
scenario. However, for the same reason, it would be difficult to distinguish
between LV and NSI at a long-baseline experiment. We show that the observations
of atmospheric neutrinos, which travel a wide range of baselines and may
encounter sharp density changes at the core-mantle boundary, can break this
degeneracy. We observe that identifying neutrinos and antineutrinos separately,
as can be done at INO-ICAL, can enhance the capability of atmospheric neutrino
experiments to discriminate between these two new-physics scenarios.

suppressed or enhanced by coupling the vibrational degrees of freedom of a

show that the chemical rate is strongly modified when the photon frequency is
close to characteristic vibrational frequencies. The origin of this remarkable
effect remains unknown. In this work, we develop an analytical rate theory for
cavity-modified ground state chemical kinetics based on the
Pollak-Grabert-H\""anggi rate theory. Unlike previous work, our theory covers
the complete range of solvent friction values, from the energy-diffusion
limited to the spatial-diffusion limited regimes. We show that the chemical
reaction rate can either be enhanced or suppressed depending on the bath
friction; when bath friction is weak chemical kinetics is enhanced as opposed
to the case of strong bath friction, where chemical kinetics is suppressed.
Further, we show that the photon frequency at which maximum modification of
chemical rate is achieved is close to the reactant well, and hence resonant
rate modification occurs. In the strong friction limit the {\it resonant}
photon frequency is instead close to the barrier frequency, as obtained using
the Grote-Hynes rate theory. Finally, we observe that the rate changes (as a
function of photon frequency) are much sharper and more sizable in the weak
friction limit than in the strong friction limit, and become increasingly sharp
with decreasing well frequency.

the ionization structure of N66 could be consistent with some leakage of

Ionization extends through much of the spatial extent of the N66 cloud complex,

of light propagation in linear magnetoeletric media are examined. In
particular, it is shown that this effect produces mixed time-space terms in the
effective metric that depend only on the antisymmetric part of the generally
non-symmetric magnetoelectric coefficient. Furthermore, it is shown that
solutions presenting analog event horizons can be proposed in this scenario,
provided that certain consistency conditions are satisfied. A short discussion
comparing different ways of constructing analog models is also presented.

computational experiments have always observed rapid, exponential decay of
coupling strengths, but our bounds predict a much slower, sub-exponential
optimal decay, and specific source/receiver distributions that can achieve such

class of problems in the theory of geometric transformations. Richard Miles
calculated moments of areas and perimeters of any order (including expectation)
of the random division of space in 1972. In the paper we calculate whole
distribution function of random divisions of plane by poisson line process.
  The idea is to interpret a random polygon as the evolution of a segment along
a moving straight line. In the plane example, the issue connected with an
infinite number of parameters is overcome by considering a secant line.
  We shall take into account the following tasks:
  {\textbf 1.} On the plane, a random set of straight lines is provided, all
shifts are equally likely, and the distribution law is of the form
$F(\varphi).$ What is the area distribution of the partition's components?
  {\textbf 2.} On the plane, a random set of points is marked. Each point $A$
has an associated area of attraction, which is the collection of points in the
plane to which the point $A$ is the nearest of the designated ones.
  In the first problem, the density of moved sections adjacent to the line
allows for the expression of the balancing ratio in kinetic form. Similarly,
you can write the perimeters kinetic equations.
  We will demonstrate how to reduce these equations to the Riccati equation
using the Laplace transformation in this paper.

respiration and heartbeat, has been investigated in recent years due to the
rising cardiopulmonary morbidity, the risk of transmitting diseases, and the
heavy burden on the medical staff. Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW)
radars have shown great promise in meeting these needs. However, contemporary
techniques for non-contact vital signs monitoring (NCVSM) via FMCW radars, are
based on simplistic models, and present difficulties coping with noisy
environments containing multiple objects. In this work, we develop an extended
model of FMCW radar signals in a noisy setting containing multiple people and
clutter. By utilizing the sparse nature of the modeled signals in conjunction
with human-typical cardiopulmonary features, we can accurately localize humans
and reliably monitor their vital signs, using only a single channel and a
single-input-single-output setup. To this end, we first show that spatial
sparsity allows for both accurate detection of multiple people and
computationally efficient extraction of their Doppler samples, using a joint
sparse recovery approach. Given the extracted samples, we develop a method
named Vital Signs based Dictionary Recovery (VSDR), which uses a
dictionary-based approach to search for the desired rates of respiration and
heartbeat over high-resolution grids corresponding to normal cardiopulmonary
activity. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated through
examples that combine the proposed model with real data of $30$ monitored
individuals. We demonstrate accurate human localization in a clutter-rich
scenario that includes both static and vibrating objects, and show that our
VSDR approach outperforms existing techniques, based on several statistical
metrics. The findings support the widespread use of FMCW radars with the
proposed algorithms in healthcare.

$\alpha (t)$ ($i.e.$ only dependent on time) in such a way that the
corresponding solution be well defined (as element of $\rL_{loc}^{1}(0,+\infty
:\rX)$, for some functional space $\rX$) after the explosion time. We start by
considering the case of an ordinary differential equation with a superlinear
term and show that the controlled explosion property holds by using a delayed
control (built through the solution of the problem and by generalizing the {\em
nonlinear variation of constants formula}, due to V.M. Alekseev in 1961, to the
case of {\em neutral delayed equations} (since the control is only in the space

arguments to the case of an evolution semilinear problem in which the
differential equation is a semilinear elliptic equation with a superlinear
absorption and the boundary condition is dynamic and involves the forcing
superlinear term giving rise to the blow up phenomenon. We prove that, under a
suitable balance between the forcing and the absorption terms, the blow up
takes place only on the boundary of the spatial domain which here is assumed to
be a ball $\rB_{\rR}$ and for a constant as initial datum.

extremely important for various phenomena including the final fate of massive
stars as type II supernovae and gravitational wave progenitors. We explore the
well-studied nearby young stellar cluster chi Per. Using Gaia EDR3 data, we
find the distance of the cluster (d = 2.260+-0.020 kpc). We then investigate
the variability of the convection-related surface structure as a source for
parallax measurement uncertainty. We use state-of-the-art 3D radiative
hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative
transfer code OPTIM3D to compute intensity maps in the Gaia G photometric

intensity-weighted mean from the synthetic maps. We then select the RSG stars
in the cluster and compare their uncertainty on parallaxes to the predictions
of photocentre displacements. The synthetic maps of RSG show extremely
irregular and temporal variable surfaces due to convection-related dynamics.
Consequentially, the position of the photo-center varies during Gaia
measurements between 0.033 and 0.130 AU (up to 5% of the corresponding
simulation stellar radius). We argue that the variability of the
convection-related surface structures accounts for a substantial part of the
Gaia EDR3 parallax error of the RSG sample. We suggest that the variation of
the uncertainty on Gaia parallax could be exploited quantitatively using
appropriate 3D simulations to extract, in a unique way, important information

holography, has the ability to solve practical problems in low energy physical
systems like metals and fluids. Holographic applications open a path for
conversation and collaboration between the theory-driven, high energy culture
of string theory and fields like nuclear and condensed matter physics, which in
contrast place great emphasis on the empirical evidence that experiment
provides. This paper takes a look at holography's history, from its roots in
string theory to its present-day applications that are challenging the cultural
identity of the field. I will focus on two of these applications: holographic
QCD and holographic superconductivity, highlighting some of the (often
incompatible) historical influences, motives, and epistemic values at play, as
well as the subcultural shifts that help the collaborations work. The extent to
which holographic research -- arguably string theory's most successful and
prolific area -- must change its subcultural identity in order to function in
fields outside of string theory reflects its changing nature and the field's
uncertain future. Does string theory lose its identity in the low-energy
applications that holography provides? Does holography still belong under
string theory's umbrella, or is it destined to form new subcultures with each
of its fields of application? I find that the answers to these questions are
dynamic, interconnected, and highly dependent on string theory's relationship
with its field of application. In some cases, holography can maintain the goals
and values it inherited from string theory. In others, it instead adopts the
goals and values of the field in which it is applied. These examples highlight
a need for the STS community to expand its treatment of string theory beyond
its relationship with empiricism and role as a theory of quantum gravity.

Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe coherent bandwidth renormalization and nonlinear

patterns in determining the spread of COVID-19 and to the effectiveness of
social distancing policies. We investigate these questions proposing an
augmented epidemiological model with an age-structured model, with the
population divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected and asymptomatic
(A), hospitalized (H), infected and symptomatic (I), and recovered individuals
(R), to simulate COVID-19 dissemination. The simulations were carried out using
six combinations of four types of isolation policies (work restrictions,
isolation of the elderly, community distancing and school closures) and four
representative fictitious countries generated over alternative demographic
transition stage patterns (aged developed, developed, developing and least
developed countries). We concluded that the basic reproduction number depends
on the age profile and the contact patterns. The aged developed country had the
lowest basic reproduction number ($R0=1.74$) due to the low contact rate among
individuals, followed by the least developed country ($R0=2.00$), the
developing country ($R0=2.43$) and the developed country ($R0=2.64$). Because
of these differences in the basic reproduction numbers, the same intervention
policies had higher efficiencies in the aged and least developed countries. Of
all intervention policies, the reduction in work contacts and community
distancing were the ones which produced the highest decrease in the $R0$ value,
prevalence, maximum hospitalization demand and fatality rate. The isolation of
the elderly was more effective in the developed and aged developed countries.
The school closure was the less effective intervention policy, though its
effects were not negligible in the least developed and developing countries.

both the storage and multiplicative costs of the real-time simulation by
approximately a factor of two with no significant impact on the resulting

time-dependent dipole moment. Additional speedups of up to a factor of 14 in
test simulations of water clusters are obtained via a straightforward GPU-based
implementation as compared to conventional CPU calculations. We also find that
further performance optimization is accessible through sagacious selection of
numerical integration algorithms, and the adaptive methods, such as the
Cash-Karp integrator provide an effective balance between computing costs and
numerical stability. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple mixed-step
integrator based on the conventional fourth-order Runge-Kutta approach is
capable of stable propagations even for strong external fields, provided the

tissues and growing or swarming bacterial colonies, can often be understood as
active nematic fluids. A key property of volume-conserving active nematic model
systems is chaotic self-mixing characterized by motile topological defects.
However, for active nematics driven by growth rather than motility, less is
understood about mixing and defect motion. Mixing could affect evolutionary
outcomes in bacterial colonies by counteracting the tendency to spatially
segregate into monoclonal sectors, which reduces the local genetic diversity
and confines competition between subpopulations to the boundaries between
neighboring sectors. To examine whether growth-driven active nematic physics
could influence this genetic demixing process, we conduct agent-based
simulations of growing, dividing, and sterically repelling rod-like bacteria of
various aspect ratios, and we analyze colony morphology using tools from both
soft matter physics and population genetics. We find that despite measurable
defect self-propulsion in growth-driven active nematics, the radial expansion
flow prevents chaotic mixing. Even so, at biologically relevant cell aspect
ratios, self-mixing is more effective in growing active nematics of rod-like
cells compared to growing isotropic colonies of round cells. This suggests
potential evolutionary consequences associated with active nematic dynamics.

Radon transform (RT) as a line integral necessitates assuming that all elements
of the Computed Tomography (CT) system, such as the detector cell, are
dimensionless. It is generally the result of such inadequate CT modeling that
analytical methods are sensitive to artifacts and noise. Then, to address this
problem, several algebraic reconstruction techniques utilizing iterative models
are suggested. The high computational cost of these methods restricts their
application. In this paper, we propose the utilization of the Scale Space Radon
Transform (SSRT), recognized for its good behavior in the scale space where,
the detector width is already considered into the SSRT design and is controlled
by the Gaussian kernel standard deviation. After depicting the basic properties
and the inversion of SSRT, the FBP algorithm is used in two different ways to
reconstruct the image from the SSRT sinogram: (1) Deconv-Rad-FBP: Deconvolve
SSRT to estimate RT and apply FBP or (2) SSRT-FBP: Modify FBP such that RT
spectrum used in FBP is replaced by SSRT, expressed in the frequency domain.
Comparison of image reconstruction using SSRT and RT are performed on
Shepp-Logan head and anthropomorphic abdominal phantoms by using, as quality
measures, PSNR and SSIM. The first findings show that the SSRT-based image
reconstruction quality is better than the one based on RT where, the SSRT-FBP
method reveals to be the most accurate, especially, when the number of
projections is reduced, making it more appropriate for applications requiring
low-dose radiation such as medical X-ray CT. While SSRT-FBP and RT-FBP
algorithm have utmost the same execution time, the former is much faster than
Deconv-Rad-FBP. Furthermore, the experiments show that the SSRT-FBP method is
more robust to CT data Poisson-Gaussian noise.

utilize the mean and variance of cell number fluctuations to separately
identify birth and death rates from time series that follow stochastic
birth-death processes with logistic growth. Our method provides a novel
perspective on stochastic parameter identifiability, which we validate by
analyzing the accuracy in terms of the discretization bin size. We apply our
method to the scenario where a homogeneous cell population goes through three
stages: (1) grows naturally to its carrying capacity, (2) is treated with a
drug that reduces its carrying capacity, and (3) overcomes the drug effect to
restore its original carrying capacity. In each stage, we disambiguate whether
it happens through the birth process, death process, or some combination of the
two, which contributes to understanding drug resistance mechanisms. In the case
of limited data sets, we provide an alternative method based on maximum
likelihood and solve a constrained nonlinear optimization problem to identify
the most likely density dependence parameter for a given cell number time
series. Our methods can be applied to other biological systems at different
scales to disambiguate density-dependent mechanisms underlying the same net

membrane potential, with the restriction that the rate takes the value 0 when
the membrane potential is 0. At each spiking time, the membrane potential of
the neuron resets to 0, and simultaneously, the membrane potentials of the
other neurons increase by one unit. The leakage can be modeled in two different
ways. In the first way, at each occurrence time of the leakage point process
associated to a neuron, the membrane potential of that neuron is reset to 0,
with no effect on the other neurons. In the second way, if the membrane
potential of the neuron is strictly positive, at each occurrence time of the

to offer more socially inclusive services. Drawing on these changes and
reflecting back on the AI world, we argue that the museum experience provides
useful lessons for building AI with socially inclusive approaches, especially

upholding the value of neutrality, practitioners are aware of the influences of
their own backgrounds and those of others on their work. By not claiming to be
neutral but practising cultural humility, the chances of addressing potential
biases can be increased. (2) There should be room for situational
interpretation beyond the stages of data collection and machine learning.
Before applying models and predictions, the contexts in which relevant parties
exist should be taken into account. (3) Community participation serves the
needs of communities and has the added benefit of bringing practitioners and

phases in the extended Gross-Pitaevskii formalism, which includes the so-called
Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction. An analytical variational ansatz allows us to
obtain the phase diagrams of the superfluid and droplet phases. The crossover
from the superfluid to the supersolid phase and to single and droplet arrays is
probed with particle number and dipolar interaction. The dipolar strength is
tuned by rotating the magnetic field with subsequent effects on phase
boundaries. Following interaction quenches across the aforementioned phases, we
monitor the dynamical formation of supersolid clusters or droplet lattices. We
include losses due to three-body recombination over the crossover regime, where
the three-body recombination rate coefficient scales with the fourth power of
the scattering length ($a_s$) or the dipole length ($a_{dd}$). For fixed values
of the dimensionless parameter, $\epsilon_{dd} = a_{dd}/a_s$, tuning the
dipolar anisotropy leads to an enhancement of the droplet lifetimes.

self-supervised learning methods based on a random image masking strategy, DAMA
employs a novel adaptive mask sampling strategy to maximize mutual information

stochastic nature of events. The ability to accurately predict how long
accidents will last can provide significant benefits to both end-users in their
route choice and traffic operation managers in handling of non-recurrent
traffic congestion. This paper presents a novel bi-level machine learning
framework enhanced with outlier removal and intra-extra joint optimisation for
predicting the incident duration on three heterogeneous data sets collected for
both arterial roads and motorways from Sydney, Australia and San-Francisco,
U.S.A. Firstly, we use incident data logs to develop a binary classification
prediction approach, which allows us to classify traffic incidents as
short-term or long-term. We find the optimal threshold between short-term
versus long-term traffic incident duration, targeting both class balance and
prediction performance while also comparing the binary versus multi-class
classification approaches. Secondly, for more granularity of the incident
duration prediction to the minute level, we propose a new Intra-Extra Joint
Optimisation algorithm (IEO-ML) which extends multiple baseline ML models
tested against several regression scenarios across the data sets. Final results
indicate that: a) 40-45 min is the best split threshold for identifying short
versus long-term incidents and that these incidents should be modelled
separately, b) our proposed IEO-ML approach significantly outperforms baseline
ML models in $66\%$ of all cases showcasing its great potential for accurate
incident duration prediction. Lastly, we evaluate the feature importance and
show that time, location, incident type, incident reporting source and weather

challenges of modern AI. In this paper, we show how to significantly accelerate
training of large transformer models by reducing activation recomputation.
Activation recomputation is commonly used to work around memory capacity
constraints. Rather than storing activations for backpropagation, they are
traditionally recomputed, which saves memory but adds redundant compute. In
this work, we show most of this redundant compute is unnecessary because we can
reduce memory consumption sufficiently without it. We present two novel yet
very simple techniques: sequence parallelism and selective activation
recomputation. In conjunction with tensor parallelism, these techniques almost
eliminate the need to recompute activations. We evaluate our approach on
language models up to one trillion parameters in scale and show that our method
reduces activation memory by 5x, while reducing execution time overhead from
activation recomputation by over 90%. For example, when training a 530B
parameter GPT-3 style model on 2240 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we achieve a Model Flops
Utilization of 54.2%, which is 29% faster than the 42.1% we achieve using

constrain the characteristics of the local pulsar population. For reasonable
model parameters, we find that we can obtain good agreement with the measured
positron fraction up to energies of $E_e \sim 300 \, {\rm GeV}$. At higher
energies, the positron fraction is dominated by a small number of pulsars,
making it difficult to reliably predict the shape of the expected positron

typically transfer approximately $\eta \sim 5-20\%$ of their total spindown
power into the production of very high-energy electron-positron pairs,
producing a spectrum of such particles with a hard spectral index, $\alpha \sim

millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
to reduce hardware cost and energy consumption. However, channel estimation in
the context of HAD is challenging due to only limited radio frequency (RF)
chains at transceivers. Although various compressive sensing (CS) algorithms
have been developed to solve this problem by exploiting inherent channel
sparsity and sparsity structures, practical effects, such as power leakage and
beam squint, can still make the real channel features deviate from the assumed
models and result in performance degradation. Also, the high complexity of CS
algorithms caused by a large number of iterations hinders their applications in
practice. To tackle these issues, we develop a deep learning (DL)-based channel
estimation approach where the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is
unfolded into a deep neural network (DNN). In each SBL layer, Gaussian variance
parameters of the sparse angular domain channel are updated by a tailored DNN,
which is able to effectively capture complicated channel sparsity structures in
various domains. Besides, the measurement matrix is jointly optimized for
performance improvement. Then, the proposed approach is extended to the
multi-block case where channel correlation in time is further exploited to
adaptively predict the measurement matrix and facilitate the update of Gaussian
variance parameters. Based on simulation results, the proposed approaches
significantly outperform existing approaches but with reduced complexity.

of backreflections from lenses within a twisted optical cavity. We achieve this
by quantitatively exploring backscatter in Fabry-P\'erot resonators, separating
the effect into three physical sectors: polarization, mode envelope and spatial
mode profile. We describe the impact of each of these sectors, and demonstrate
how to minimize backreflections within each. This culminates in measured
effective reflectivities below the part-per-billion level for the fundamental
mode. Additionally, we show that beams carrying orbital angular momentum
experience up to $10^{4}$ times additional suppression, limited only by the
density of states of other cavity modes. Applying these ideas to laser
gyroscopes could strongly suppress lock-in, thereby improving sensitivity at
low rotation rates.

both problems simultaneously by employing an attention mechanism over the
competing video tracks of the speakers' faces, at the cost of sacrificing some
accuracy on active speaker detection. This work closes this gap in active
speaker detection accuracy by presenting a single model that can be jointly

majorizations, all color sequences (not only the balanced ones) for which there
exists an ancestral coloring for perfect binary trees. We then develop an
almost linear time (in the number of tree nodes) divide-and-conquer algorithm
to generate such a coloring for every perfect binary tree of height $h\geq 1$.
The existence of a balanced ancestral coloring reveals an interesting fact
about combinatorial batch code: when the batch follows a special pattern
(consisting of nodes along a root-to-leaf path in a tree), the total storage
capacity required can be reduced by a factor of $\Theta(h)$ compared to when
the batch is arbitrary while keeping a balanced storage capacity across $h$
servers. Furthermore, our result also identifies an infinite family of graphs
for which the equitable chromatic number can be explicitly determined. As far

trial and error, translating RL algorithms into the real world has remained
challenging. A major hurdle to real-world application arises from the
development of algorithms in an episodic setting where the environment is reset
after every trial, in contrast with the continual and non-episodic nature of
the real-world encountered by embodied agents such as humans and robots. Prior
works have considered an alternating approach where a forward policy learns to
solve the task and the backward policy learns to reset the environment, but
what initial state distribution should the backward policy reset the agent to?
Assuming access to a few demonstrations, we propose a new method, MEDAL, that
trains the backward policy to match the state distribution in the provided
demonstrations. This keeps the agent close to the task-relevant states,
allowing for a mix of easy and difficult starting states for the forward
policy. Our experiments show that MEDAL matches or outperforms prior methods on
three sparse-reward continuous control tasks from the EARL benchmark, with 40%
gains on the hardest task, while making fewer assumptions than prior works.

scales of molecular dynamics simulations beyond what is practically possible in
the atomistic regime. Sampling molecular configurations of interest can be done
efficiently using coarse-grained simulations, from which meaningful
physicochemical information can be inferred if the corresponding all-atom
configurations are reconstructed. However, this procedure of backmapping to
reintroduce the lost atomistic detail into coarse-grain structures has proven a
challenging task due to the many feasible atomistic configurations that can be
associated with one coarse-grain structure. Existing backmapping methods are
strictly frame-based, relying on either heuristics to replace coarse-grain
particles with atomic fragments and subsequent relaxation, or parameterized
models to propose atomic coordinates separately and independently for each
coarse-grain structure. These approaches neglect information from previous
trajectory frames that is critical to ensuring temporal coherence of the
backmapped trajectory, while also offering information potentially helpful to
produce higher-fidelity atomic reconstructions. In this work we present a deep
learning-enabled data-driven approach for temporally coherent backmapping that
explicitly incorporates information from preceding trajectory structures. Our
method trains a conditional variational autoencoder to non-deterministically
reconstruct atomistic detail conditioned on both the target coarse-grain
configuration and the previously reconstructed atomistic configuration. We
demonstrate our backmapping approach on two exemplar biomolecular systems:
alanine dipeptide and the miniprotein chignolin. We show that our backmapped
trajectories accurately recover the structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic
properties of the atomistic trajectory data.

f-divergences. f-GM allows the experimenter to flexibly design the f-divergence
function without changing the structure of the networks or the learning

network and a density estimator. Therefore it simultaneously enables sampling,
posterior inference of the latent variable as well as evaluation of the
likelihood of an arbitrary datum. f-GM belongs to the class of encoder-decoder
GANs: our density estimator can be interpreted as playing the role of a
discriminator between samples in the joint space of latent code and observed

as special cases, and illustrates the connections between different
encoder-decoder GAN architectures. f-GM is compatible with general network
architecture and optimizer. We leverage it to experimentally explore the
effects -- e.g. mode collapse and image sharpness -- of different choices of

topologies of the favorable Calabi Yau (CY) threefolds with $1 \leq h^{1,1}(CY)
\leq 5$ arising from the four-dimensional reflexive polytopes of the
Kreuzer-Skarke database. Based on some empirical observations we conjecture
that the topologies of the so-called coordinate divisors can be classified into
two categories: (i). $\chi_{_h}(D) \geq 1$ with Hodge numbers given by
$\{h^{0,0} = 1, \, h^{1,0} = 0, \, h^{2,0} = \chi_{_h}(D) -1, \, h^{1,1} =

given by $\{h^{0,0} = 1, \, h^{1,0} = 1 - \chi_{_h}(D), \, h^{2,0} = 0, \,
h^{1,1} = \chi(D) + 2 - 4 \chi_{_h}(D)\}$, where $\chi_{_h}(D)$ denotes the
Arithmetic genus while $\chi(D)$ denotes the Euler characteristic of the
divisor $D$. We present the Hodge numbers of around 140000 coordinate divisors
corresponding to all the CY threefolds with $1 \leq h^{1,1}(CY) \leq 5$ which
corresponds to a total of nearly 16000 distinct CY geometries. Subsequently we
argue that our conjecture can help in ``bypassing"" the need of cohomCalg for
computing Hodge numbers of coordinate divisors, and hence can be significantly
useful for studying the divisor topologies of CY threefolds with higher
$h^{1,1}$ for which cohomCalg gets too slow and sometimes even breaks as well.
We also demonstrate how these scanning results can be directly used for
phenomenological model building, e.g. in estimating the $D3$-brane tadpole
charge (under reflection involutions) which is a central ingredient for
constructing explicit global models due to several different reasons/interests
such as the de-Sitter uplifting through anti-$D3$ brane and (flat) flux vacua

turbulent regime, requires a method that is non-dissipative and stable at high
Reynolds ($Re$) numbers. For a compressible flow, it is known that discrete
conservation of kinetic energy is not a sufficient condition for numerical
stability, unlike in incompressible flows.
  In this study, we adopt the recently developed conservative diffuse-interface
method (Jain, Mani $\&$ Moin, $\textit{J. Comput. Phys.}$, 2020) along with the
five-equation model for the simulation of compressible two-phase flows. This
method discretely conserves the mass of each phase, momentum, and total energy
of the system. We here propose discrete consistency conditions between the
numerical fluxes, such that any set of numerical fluxes that satisfy these
conditions would not spuriously contribute to the kinetic energy and entropy of
the system. We also present a set of numerical fluxes\textemdash which
satisfies these consistency conditions\textemdash that results in an exact
conservation of kinetic energy and approximate conservation of entropy in the
absence of pressure work, viscosity, thermal diffusion effects, and
time-discretization errors. Since the model consistently reduces to the
single-phase Navier-Stokes system when the properties of the two phases are
identical, the proposed consistency conditions and numerical fluxes are also
applicable for a broader class of single-phase flows.
  To this end, we present coarse-grid numerical simulations of compressible
single-phase and two-phase turbulent flows at infinite $Re$, to illustrate the
stability of the proposed method in canonical test cases, such as an isotropic
turbulence and Taylor-Green vortex flows. A higher-resolution simulation of a
droplet-laden compressible decaying isotropic turbulence is also presented, and
the effect of the presence of droplets on the flow is analyzed.

lack particles larger than 10 m. Tidal or collisional destruction of
satellites/comets have been proposed as the origin of the main rings; however,
Saturn's tide alone cannot grind km-sized fragments into submeter-sized
particles because of the high mechanical strength of water ice and rock. The
question arises as to why such large particles are not left in the current
ring. It is known that thermal stress induced by diurnal and seasonal
temperature variations can cause weathering and fragmentation of boulders and
contribute to dust and regolith production on the Moon and terrestrial planets,
and then such thermal stress can break particles larger than a critical radius
while cannot smaller than the critical radius. In this study, we examined the
role of thermal stress acting on Saturn's ring particles. We found that thermal
stress can grind porous ring particles larger than 10-20 m, which explains the
lack of particles larger than 10 m in Saturn's ring. Also, fragmentation by
thermal stress can be adoptable for the Epsilon rings of Uranus. Furthermore,
thermal stress caused by diurnal or seasonal temperature variation acting on
boulders on surfaces of icy satellites and asteroids may play an important role
in the evolution of their sizes. Our calculations explain the lack of boulders
on icy satellites, except in the geologically active provinces such as the
tiger stripes of Enceladus, where boulders are supplied by recent geological
activity. We predict that future observations can find numerous boulders around

Policies (CCP) method of enabling consecutive agents to cooperatively solve
long time horizon multi-stage tasks. This method is achieved by modifying the
policy of each agent to maximise both the current and next agent's critic.
Cooperatively maximising critics allows each agent to take actions that are
beneficial for its task as well as subsequent tasks. Using this method in a
multi-room maze domain and a peg in hole manipulation domain, the cooperative
policies were able to outperform a set of naive policies, a single agent
trained across the entire domain, as well as another sequential HRL algorithm.

reality, however, some seed users may be reluctant to spread the information,
or need to be paid higher to be motivated. Furthermore, the existing IM works
pay little attention to capture user's influence propagation in the future

Reconnecting Top-l Relationships (RTlR) query, which aims to find l number of

aggregate the compositions into a smaller number of principal compositions,
guided by the available taxonomic structure, by minimizing a properly measured
loss of information. The choice of the loss function is flexible and can be
based on familiar diversity indices for preserving either within-sample or
between-sample diversity in the data. To enable scalable computation, we
develop a hierarchical PAA algorithm to trace the entire trajectory of

combine this approach with random phase wave function approximation to obtain
closed-form expressions for gradients that can be used to infer population

appropriateness for an application ecosystem is critical for its responsible
use, and requires considering a broad range of factors including harms,

frequently focus on only a narrow range of decontextualized predictive
behaviours. We examine the evaluation gaps between the idealized breadth of
evaluation concerns and the observed narrow focus of actual evaluations.
Through an empirical study of papers from recent high-profile conferences in
the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, we demonstrate
a general focus on a handful of evaluation methods. By considering the metrics
and test data distributions used in these methods, we draw attention to which
properties of models are centered in the field, revealing the properties that
are frequently neglected or sidelined during evaluation. By studying these
properties, we demonstrate the machine learning discipline's implicit
assumption of a range of commitments which have normative impacts; these
include commitments to consequentialism, abstractability from context, the
quantifiability of impacts, the limited role of model inputs in evaluation, and
the equivalence of different failure modes. Shedding light on these assumptions
enables us to question their appropriateness for ML system contexts, pointing
the way towards more contextualized evaluation methodologies for robustly
examining the trustworthiness of ML models

effects of ram pressure stripping (RPS) on star formation in cluster
environments. It has been thought that the star formation activity of jellyfish
galaxies may depend on the host cluster properties, but previous studies have
not yet found a clear correlation. In this study, we estimate the \Ha-based
star formation rates (SFRs) of five jellyfish galaxies in massive clusters
($\sigma_{v, {\rm cl}}\gtrsim1000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$) at $z\sim0.3-0.4$ using
Gemini GMOS/IFU observations to explore the relationship. Combining our results
with those in the literature, we find that the star formation activity of
jellyfish galaxies shows a positive correlation with their host cluster
velocity dispersion as a proxy of cluster mass and dynamical states. We divide
the jellyfish galaxy sample into two groups with strong and weak RPS signatures
using a morphological class. In the phase-space diagram, the jellyfish galaxies
with strong RPS features show a higher SFR and a stronger central concentration
than those with weak RPS features. We estimate their SFR excess relative to the
star formation main sequence (starburstiness; $R_{\rm SB}={\rm
SFR/SFR_{MS}}(z)$) and the density of the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM)
using scaling relations with the cluster velocity dispersion. As a result, the
starburstiness of jellyfish galaxies with strong RPS signatures clearly
exhibits positive correlations with cluster velocity dispersion, ICM density,
and strength of ram pressure. This shows that the relation between RPS and star
formation activity of jellyfish galaxies depends on the host cluster properties
and strength of ram pressure.

systems accurately without the computational cost limitation imposed by

years, depending upon the solver used. Here we present the creation and release
of an open-source multi-timescale micromagnetic code combining three key
solvers: Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert; Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch; Kinetic Monte Carlo.
This code, called MARS (Models of Advanced Recording Systems), is capable of
accurately simulating the magnetisation dynamics in large and structurally
complex single- and multi-layered granular systems. The short timescale
simulations are achieved for systems far from and close to the Curie point via
the implemented Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch solvers
respectively. This enables read/write simulations for general perpendicular
magnetic recording and also state of the art heat assisted magnetic recording
(HAMR). The long timescale behaviour is simulated via the Kinetic Monte Carlo
solver, enabling investigations into signal-to-noise ratio and data longevity.
The combination of these solvers opens up the possibility of multi-timescale
simulations within a single software package. For example the entire HAMR
process from initial data writing and data read back to long term data storage
is possible via a single simulation using MARS. The use of atomistic
parameterisation for the material input of MARS enables highly accurate
material descriptions which provide a bridge between atomistic simulation and
real world experimentation. Thus MARS is capable of performing simulations for
all aspects of recording media research and development. This ranges from
material characterisation and optimisation to system design and implementation.

accurate spatial detail representation with more clues; 2) S-VSR to T-VSR:
abundant spatial information contributes to the refinement of temporal

spatial-temporal correlations via the mutual learning between S-VSR and T-VSR.

positive characteristic. For instance, smooth projective hypersurfaces may be
covered by lines despite being of arbitrarily high degree. The purpose of this
dissertation is to define a class of hypersurfaces that exhibits such
classically unexpected properties, and to offer a perspective with which to
conceptualize such phenomena.
  Specifically, this dissertation proposes an analogy between the eponymous
$q$-bic hypersurfaces -- special hypersurfaces of degree $q+1$, with $q$ any
power of the ground field characteristic, a familiar example given by the
corresponding Fermat hypersurface -- and low degree hypersurfaces, especially
quadrics and cubics. This analogy is substantiated by concrete results such as:
$q$-bic hypersurfaces are moduli spaces of isotropic vectors for a bilinear
form; the Fano schemes of linear spaces contained in a smooth $q$-bic
hypersurface are smooth, irreducible, and carry structures similar to
orthogonal Grassmannian; and the intermediate Jacobian of a $q$-bic threefold
is purely inseparably isogenous to the Albanese variety of its smooth Fano
surface of lines.

state (EoS) of dense, neutron-rich matter, which connects the atomic nuclei
with the hot and dense matter in universe, thus has been the subject of intense
investigations in laboratory experiments, astronomy observations and theories.
Various probes have been proposed to constrain the symmetry energy and its
density dependence. Currently, the extensive data yield already a good and
consistent constraint to the symmetry energy ($E_\text{sym}(\rho)$) at
saturation density, but do not yet give a consistent result of one critical EoS
parameter, $L$, the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this work, we
report a new probe of $L$ at saturation density. A good linear correlation is
found between $L$ and the charge changing cross section difference
($\Delta\sigma_\text{cc}$) of mirror nuclei $^{30}$Si-$^{30}$S for both the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock theory (SHF) and covariant (relativistic) density
functionals (CDF). We found that the pairing effect for this mirror pair is
essential to get a consistent correlation between $L$ and
$\Delta\sigma_\text{cc}$ in both the SHF and CDF. Here, the cross sections are
calculated on the same target and at the same energy using the zero-range
optical-limit Glauber model. The linearity is found to be in the same precision
as those found between $L$ and neutron skin thickness or proton radius
difference.

attacks and strokes. Plaque formation is orchestrated by macrophages that are
recruited to the artery wall to consume and remove blood-derived lipids, such
as low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Ineffective lipid removal, due to macrophage
death and other factors, leads to the accumulation of lipid-loaded macrophages
and formation of a necrotic core. Experimental observations suggest that
macrophage functionality varies with the extent of lipid loading. However,
little is known about the resultant influence on plaque fate. Extending work by
Ford et al. (2019) and Chambers et al. (2022), we develop a plaque model in
which macrophages are classified by their ingested lipid content and behave in
a lipid-dependent manner. The model, a system of partial-integro differential
equations, considers several macrophage behaviours. These include: recruitment
to the artery wall; proliferation and apoptosis; ingestion of LDL, apoptotic
cells and necrotic lipid; emigration from the artery wall; and necrosis of
apoptotic cells. Here, we consider apoptosis, emigration and proliferation to
be lipid-dependent. We model lipid-dependence in these behaviours with
experimentally-informed functions of the internalised lipid load. Our results
demonstrate that lipid-dependent macrophage behaviour can substantially alter
plaque fate by changing both the total quantity of lipid in the plaque and the
distribution of lipid between the live cells, dead cells and necrotic core. For
lipid-dependent apoptosis and lipid-dependent emigration simulations, we find
significant differences in outcomes for cases that ultimately converge on the
same net rate of apoptosis or emigration.

ultrasound. We first convert ultrasound waves to reflected ultrasound
directional images (ultrasound images) to perform segmentation from invisible
information. Although ultrasound images can roughly identify a person's
location, the detailed shape is ambiguous. To address this problem, we propose
a collaborative learning probabilistic U-Net that uses ultrasound and
segmentation images simultaneously during training, closing the probabilistic
distributions between ultrasound and segmentation images by comparing the
parameters of the latent spaces. In inference, only ultrasound images can be
used to obtain segmentation results. As a result of performance verification,
the proposed method could estimate human segmentations more accurately than
conventional probabilistic U-Net and other variational autoencoder models.

(DT) and extreme learning machine (ELM), a new classification model, called the
subspace learning machine (SLM), is proposed in this work. SLM first identifies
a discriminant subspace, $S^0$, by examining the discriminant power of each
input feature. Then, it uses probabilistic projections of features in $S^0$ to
yield 1D subspaces and finds the optimal partition for each of them. This is
equivalent to partitioning $S^0$ with hyperplanes. A criterion is developed to
choose the best $q$ partitions that yield $2q$ partitioned subspaces among
them. We assign $S^0$ to the root node of a decision tree and the intersections
of $2q$ subspaces to its child nodes of depth one. The partitioning process is
recursively applied at each child node to build an SLM tree. When the samples
at a child node are sufficiently pure, the partitioning process stops and each
leaf node makes a prediction. The idea can be generalized to regression,
leading to the subspace learning regressor (SLR). Furthermore, ensembles of
SLM/SLR trees can yield a stronger predictor. Extensive experiments are
conducted for performance benchmarking among SLM/SLR trees, ensembles and
classical classifiers/regressors.

Artificial Intelligence (XAI) initiative, which aims to make algorithms
explainable to comply with legal requirements, promote trust, and maintain
accountability. This paper questions whether and to what extent explainability
can help solve the responsibility issues posed by autonomous AI systems. We
suggest that XAI systems that provide post-hoc explanations could be seen as
blameworthy agents, obscuring the responsibility of developers in the
decision-making process. Furthermore, we argue that XAI could result in
incorrect attributions of responsibility to vulnerable stakeholders, such as
those who are subjected to algorithmic decisions (i.e., patients), due to a
misguided perception that they have control over explainable algorithms. This
conflict between explainability and accountability can be exacerbated if

We conclude with a set of recommendations for how to approach this tension in
the socio-technical process of algorithmic decision-making and a defense of
hard regulation to prevent designers from escaping responsibility.

applications require a detailed statistical characterization of the latency.
Teleoperation is a representative use case, in which a human operator (HO)
remotely controls a robot by exchanging command and feedback signals. We
present a framework to analyze the latency of a closed-loop teleoperation
system consisting of three entities: HO, robot located in remote environment,
and a Base Station (BS) with Mobile edge Computing (MEC) capabilities. A model
of each component of the system is used to analyze the closed-loop latency and
decide upon the optimal compression strategy. The closed-form expression of the
distribution of the closed-loop latency is difficult to estimate, such that
suitable upper and lower bounds are obtained. We formulate a non-convex
optimization problem to minimize the closed-loop latency. Using the obtained
upper and lower bound on the closed-loop latency, a computationally efficient
procedure to optimize the closed-loop latency is presented. The simulation
results reveal that compression of sensing data is not always beneficial, while
system design based on average performance leads to under-provisioning and may
cause performance degradation. The applicability of the proposed analysis is
much wider than teleoperation, for systems whose latency budget consists of
many components.

(DRO) problems which includes prominent instances such as task scheduling, the
assemble-to-order system, and supply chain network design. The ambiguity set is
constrained by fixed marginal distributions that are not necessarily discrete.
We develop a numerical algorithm for computing approximately optimal solutions
of such problems. Through replacing the marginal constraints by a finite
collection of linear constraints, we derive a relaxation of the DRO problem
which serves as its upper bound. We can control the relaxation error to be
arbitrarily close to 0. We develop duality results and transform the inf-sup
problem into an inf-inf problem. This leads to a numerical algorithm for
two-stage DRO problems with marginal constraints which solves a linear
semi-infinite optimization problem. Besides an approximately optimal solution,
the algorithm computes both an upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal
value of the problem. The difference between the computed bounds provides a
direct sub-optimality estimate of the computed solution. Most importantly, one
can choose the inputs of the algorithm such that the sub-optimality is
controlled to be arbitrarily small. In our numerical examples, we apply the
proposed algorithm to task scheduling, the assemble-to-order system, and supply
chain network design. The ambiguity sets in these problems involve a large
number of marginals, which include both discrete and continuous distributions.
The numerical results showcase that the proposed algorithm computes
high-quality robust decisions along with their corresponding sub-optimality
estimates with practically reasonable magnitudes that are not
over-conservative.

possible candidates to contribute to the energy input required to heat the
corona as a part of the AC heating theory. However, the resolution of imaging
instruments up until the Solar Orbiter have made it impossible to resolve the
necessary time and spatial scales. The present paper reports on high-frequency
transverse motions in a small loop located in a quiet Sun region of the corona.
The oscillations were observed with the HRIEUV telescope (17.4 nm) of the EUI
instrument onboard the Solar Orbiter. We detect two transverse oscillations in
short loops with lengths of 4.5 Mm and 11 Mm. The shorter loop displays an
oscillation with a 14 s period and the longer a 30 s period. Despite the high
resolution, no definitive identification as propagating or standing waves is
possible. The velocity amplitudes are found to be equal to 72 km/s and 125
km/s, respectively, for the shorter and longer loop. Based on that, we also
estimated the values of the energy flux contained in the loops - the energy
flux of the 14 s oscillation is 1.9 kW m^-2 and of the 30 s oscillation it is
6.5 kW m^-2 . While these oscillations have been observed in the Quiet Sun,
their energy fluxes are of the same order as the energy input required to heat
the active solar corona. Numerical simulations were performed in order to
reproduce the observed oscillations. The correspondence of the numerical
results to the observations provide support to the energy content estimates for
the observations. Such high energy densities have not yet been observed in
decayless coronal waves, and this is promising for coronal heating models based
on wave damping.

for each vehicle to ensure a trip with lower external exposure. Both extensions
require that the risk exposure of each onboard passenger is propagated in a
minimized fashion while satisfying other existing constraints of the DARP. To
fully describe the RDARP, we first provide a three-index arc-based formulation
and reformulate the RDARP into an equivalent min-max trip-based formulation,
which is solved by an exact Branch-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm. For each node

elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints and minimized

While known for the line-of-sight, the propagation paths have yet to be

calibration approach for determining the propagation paths by estimating
reflection points. Therefore, first a statistical fading model is presented,
that describes user-induced changes in the received signal of multipath
components. The model is derived and validated empirically using an extensive
set of wideband and ultra-wideband measurement data. Second, the Bayesian
approach is presented, which, based on the derived empirical fading model,
relates measured changes in the power of a multipath component to the location
of the reflection point. Exploiting the geometric properties of multipath
components caused by single-bounce reflections, the solution space of possible
locations of reflection points is constrained to the delay ellipse. Thus, a
one-dimensional elliptic estimation problem can be formulated, which is solved
using a point mass filter. The applicability of the proposed approach is
demonstrated and evaluated based on measurement data. Independent of the
underlying measurement system, the Bayesian calibration approach is shown to
robustly estimate the locations of the reflection points in different

allocation for a set of static autonomous radars with rotating antennas. It
allows a set of radars to allocate in a fully decentralized way a set of active
tracking tasks according to their location, considering that a target can be
tracked by several radars, in order to improve accuracy with which the target
is tracked. The allocation algorithm proceeds through a collaborative and fully
decentralized auction protocol, using a collaborative auction protocol
(Consensus Based Bundle Auction algorithm). Our algorithm is based on a double
use of our allocation protocol among the radars. The latter begin by allocating
targets, then launch a second round of allocation if theyhave resources left,
in order to improve accuracy on targets already tracked. Our algorithm is also
able to adapt to dynamism, i.e. to take into account the fact that the targets
are moving and that the radar(s) most suitable for Tracking them changes as the
mission progresses. To do this, the algorithm is restarted on a regular basis,
to ensure that a bid made by a radar can decrease when the target moves away
from it. Since our algorithm is based on collaborative auctions, it does not
plan the following rounds, assuming that the targets are not predictable enough
for this. Our algorithm is however based on radars capable of anticipating the
positions of short-term targets, thanks to a Kalman filter. The algorithm will
be illustrated based on a multi-radar tracking scenario where the radars,
autonomous, must follow a set of targets in order to reduce the position
uncertainty of the targets. Standby aspects will not be considered in this
scenario. It is assumed that the radars can pick up targets in active pursuit,
with an area ofuncertainty corresponding to their distance.

analyzing a high resolution FLC of the Crab pulsar obtained at $1 - 10$ keV
using the {\it{NICER}} observatory. The rising edge of the first peak of the
FLC and the reflected version of the falling edge of the second peak are
compared in several ways, and phase ranges are identified where the two curves
are statistically similar. The best matching occurs when the two peaks are
aligned, but only in a small phase range of $\approx 0.0244$ just below their
peaks; their mean difference is $-0.78 \pm 1.8$ photons/sec with a reduced
$\chi^2$ of $0.93$. If the first curve is convolved by a Laplace function, the
corresponding numbers are phase range of $\approx 0.0274$, mean difference of
$-1.23 \pm 1.30$ and $\chi^2$ of $0.76$. These phase ranges are much smaller
than those over which the reflection symmetry has been perceived. Therefore the
only way the two edges can have a mirror relation over a substantial phase
range is if one invokes a broad and faint emission component of amplitude
$\approx 100$ photons/sec and width $\approx 0.1$ in phase, centered at phase
$\approx 0.1$ beyond the second peak.

nonlinear complementarity problems and able to automatically detect the

applied to a nonsmooth ODE, the accuracy is at best of order one. In FESD, we
let the integrator step-size to be a degree of freedom. Additional
complementarity conditions, that we call cross complementarities, enable exact
switch detection, hence FESD is able to recover the high order accuracy which
the RK methods enjoy for smooth ODE. Additional conditions called step
equilibration allow the step-size to change only when switches occur and thus
avoid spurious degrees of freedom. Convergence results for the FESD method are
derived, local uniqueness of the solution and convergence of numerical
sensitivities are proven. The efficacy of FESD in demonstrated on several
simulation and optimal control examples. In an optimal control problem

of various parameters such as the photon energies and material thickness on the

estimators that differ in the data used during training and estimation. First,
we show that given perfectly known channel state information at the input of
the VAE during estimation, which is impractical, we obtain an estimator that
can serve as a benchmark result for an estimation scenario. We then propose
practically feasible approaches, where perfectly known channel state
information is only necessary in the training phase or is not needed at all.
Simulation results on 3GPP and QuaDRiGa channel data attest a small performance

as quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares, slow magnetoacoustic
waves offer an important seismological tool for probing many vital parameters
of the coronal plasma. A recently understood active nature of the solar corona
for magnetoacoustic waves, manifested through the phenomenon of wave-induced
thermal misbalance, led to the identification of new natural mechanisms for the
interpretation of observed properties of waves. A frequency-dependent damping
of slow waves in various coronal plasma structures remains an open question, as
traditional wave damping theories fail to match observations. We demonstrate
that accounting for the back-reaction caused by thermal misbalance on the wave
dynamics leads to a modification of the relationship between the damping time
and oscillation period of standing slow waves, prescribed by the linear theory.
The modified relationship is not of a power-law form and has the equilibrium
plasma conditions and properties of the coronal heating/cooling processes as
free parameters. It is shown to readily explain the observed scaling of the
damping time with period of standing slow waves in hot coronal loops.
Functional forms of the unknown coronal heating process, consistent with the
observed frequency-dependent damping, are seismologically revealed.

a certain node in a given graph, a traditional GNN layer can be regarded as an
aggregation from one-hop neighbors, thus a set of stacked layers are able to
fetch and update node status within multi-hops. For nodes with sparse
connectivity, it is difficult to obtain enough information through a single GNN
layer as not only there are only few nodes directly connected to them but also
can not propagate the high-order neighbor information. However, as the number
of layer increases, the GNN model is prone to over-smooth for nodes with the
dense connectivity, which resulting in the decrease of accuracy. To tackle this
issue, in this thesis, we define a novel framework that allows the normal GNN
model to accommodate more layers. Specifically, a node-degree based gate is
employed to adjust weight of layers dynamically, that try to enhance the
information aggregation ability and reduce the probability of over-smoothing.
Experimental results show that our proposed model can effectively increase the

process through visible photons holds tremendous potential for several aspects
of quantum information science, e.g., the optical control and readout of
qubits. In this context, the direct observation of this phenomenon via
spin-sensitive spectroscopies is of utmost importance to establish future
guidelines to control photo-driven spin selectivity in chiral structures. Here,
we provide direct proof that time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) can be used to detect long-lived spin polarization generated by
photoinduced charge transfer through a chiral bridge. We propose a system
comprising CdSe QDs, as a donor, and C60, as an acceptor, covalently linked
through a saturated oligopeptide helical bridge (\c{hi}) with a rigid structure
of ~ 10{\AA}. Time-resolved EPR spectroscopy shows that the charge transfer in
our system results in a C60 radical anion, whose spin polarization maximum is
observed at longer times with respect to that of the photogenerated C60 triplet
state. Notably, the theoretical modeling of the EPR spectra reveals that the
observed features may be compatible with chirality-induced spin selectivity and
identifies which parameters need optimization for unambiguous detection of the
phenomenon. This work lays the basis for the optical generation and direct

cable under repeated short-scale Strouhal vibrations induced by water-flow.
Equivalent vertical motions of 0.5-m amplitudes are found dominant at frequency
f*/4, with monotonically decreasing peaks at f*/2, 3f*/4 and f* = 1.083f, where
f denotes the local inertial frequency of Earth rotation. The observations
provide, physically, proof of the Earth rotation and, oceanographically, of the
relative vortex-rotation dzeta = 0.083f induced by (sub-)mesoscale eddies
associated with a nearby seamount, so that effective near-inertial frequency f*
= f + dzeta. As instrumentation only shows mid-cable resonant signals it is not
considered as a Foucault pendulum, but more likely an Earth-rotation equivalent
of the Wheatstone device with the mooring cable acting as elastic springs.
While the f*/2 motion reflects the Foucault principle of linear orbits fixed in
an inertial frame of reference, the dominant sub-harmonic f*/4 suggests
resemblance with the precession of a spherical oscillator at half the angular
speed of rotation.

  We investigate how to acquire semantic sensitive annotation representations

because manual CNNs are almost proposed for natural image processing, it
becomes very redundant and inefficient to process HRS images. On the other

of the droplet due to viscous drag force. The droplet response to the external
impulsive decelerating force induces oscillatory modes on the surface exposed
to the air forming capillary waves that superimpose to form air craters of
various shapes and sizes. We introduce a non-dimensional parameter
(${\Gamma}$), that is, the ratio of drag force to the capillary force acting on
the droplet. We show that ${\Gamma}$ is directly proportional to the capillary
number. We show that droplets forming air craters of significant depths have
${\Gamma}>1$. Further, we demonstrate that Legendre polynomials can locally
approximate the central air crater jet profile. We also decipher that the air
crater response time scale ($T$) varies as the square root of impact Weber
number ($T{\sim}We^{1/2}$). Further, we generalize the local droplet response
with a global response model for low-impact energies based on an eigenvalue
problem. We represent the penetrating drop as a constrained Rayleigh drop
problem with a dynamic contact line. The air-water interface dynamics is
analyzed using an inviscid droplet deformation model for small deformation
amplitudes. The local and global droplet response theory conforms with each

compare the velocity pattern over the molecular shell with the mean radial
velocity of the cluster for estimates of the expansion velocities of different
shell structures, and to match the observed properties with model simulations.
Optical spectra of 27 stars located in Berkeley 59 were collected at the Nordic
Optical Telescope, and a number of molecular structures scattered over the
entire region were mapped in $^{13}$CO(1-0) at Onsala Space Observatory. We
obtained radial velocities and MK classes for the cluster's stars. At least
four of the O stars are found to be spectroscopic binaries, in addition to one
triplet system. From these data we obtain the mean radial velocity of the
cluster. From the $^{13}$CO spectra we identify three shell structures,
expanding relative to the cluster at moderate velocity (4 km/s), high velocity
(12 km/s), and in between. The high-velocity cloudlets extend over a larger
radius and are less massive than the low-velocity cloudlets. We performed a
model simulation to understand the evolution of this complex. Our simulation of
the Sharpless 171 complex and Berkeley 59 cluster demonstrates that the
individual components can be explained as a shell driven by stellar winds from
the massive cluster members. However, our relatively simple model produces a
single component. Modelling of the propagation of shell fragments through a
uniform interstellar medium demonstrates that dense cloudlets detached from the
shell are decelerated less efficiently than the shell itself. They can reach
greater distances and retain higher velocities than the shell.

the spatially-varying current from measurements of the wavy surface. We examine
how remote sensing of currents is achieved in practice by analyzing the wave
spectrum, as may be measured for example by X-band radar. A set of consecutive
backscatter images recorded as a function of time is Fourier-transformed to
produce the spectrum, which gives information concerning the propagation of
waves whose dispersion is altered by currents. X-band radar images measure the
wave field over multiple square kilometers, and analyzing various spatial
subsets of the images allows a map of the spatial variation of the currents to
be reconstructed. Several algorithms for obtaining empirical dispersion
relations from the measured spectrum and extracting the currents are reviewed:
the least squares and iterative least squares method, the normalized scalar
product method, and the polar current shell method. We go on to describe how
the same methods and algorithms can be extended to also allowing the
depth-dependence of the current to be determined. Reasonable agreement between
radar-derived currents and in situ measurements has been demonstrated in
multiple field measurements. However, more validation is necessary especially
in the context of depth-varying flows. Understanding the extent to which Stokes
drift is measured as part of the radar-derived current is not well-understood

resonances in a subwavelength annular hole embedded in a metallic slab, with
the annulus width $h\ll1$. The model is representative among many 3D
subwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of
electromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We
develop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon
a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide
mode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field
over the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which
are used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By
performing rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance
conditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the
complex plane. It is shown that the resonances are associated with the TE and
TEM waveguide modes in the annular hole, and they are close to the real axis
with the imaginary parts of order ${\cal O}(h)$. We also investigate the
resonant scattering when an incident wave is present. It is proved that the
electromagnetic field is amplified with order ${\cal O}(1/h)$ at the resonant
frequencies that are associated with the TE modes in the annular hole. On the
other hand, one particular resonance associated with the TEM mode can not be
excited by a plane wave but can be excited with a near-field electric dipole
source, leading to field enhancement of order ${\cal O}(1/h)$.

children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and thus serve as
an important target for identification and treatment. Most of these seizures
have no discernible clinical manifestation but still have a significant impact
on morbidity and mortality. Children that are deemed at risk for seizures
within the PICU are monitored using continuous-electroencephalogram (cEEG).
cEEG monitoring cost is considerable and as the number of available machines is
always limited, clinicians need to resort to triaging patients according to
perceived risk in order to allocate resources. This research aims to develop a
computer aided tool to improve seizures risk assessment in critically-ill
children, using an ubiquitously recorded signal in the PICU, namely the
electrocardiogram (ECG). Approach: A novel data-driven model was developed at a
patient-level approach, based on features extracted from the first hour of ECG
recording and the clinical data of the patient. Main results: The most
predictive features were the age of the patient, the brain injury as coma
etiology and the QRS area. For patients without any prior clinical data, using
one hour of ECG recording, the classification performance of the random forest
classifier reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) score of 0.84. When combining ECG features with the patients clinical
history, the AUROC reached 0.87. Significance: Taking a real clinical scenario,
we estimated that our clinical decision support triage tool can improve the
positive predictive value by more than 59% over the clinical standard.

embedding has achieved great progress in solving physical problems described by
governing equations. However, for many engineering problems, governing
equations often have complex forms, including complex partial derivatives or
stochastic physical fields, which results in significant inconveniences from
the perspective of implementation. In this paper, a scientific machine learning
framework, called AutoKE, is proposed, and a reservoir flow problem is taken as
an instance to demonstrate that this framework can effectively automate the
process of embedding physical knowledge. In AutoKE, an emulator comprised of
deep neural networks (DNNs) is built for predicting the physical variables of
interest. An arbitrarily complex equation can be parsed and automatically
converted into a computational graph through the equation parser module, and
the fitness of the emulator to the governing equation is evaluated via
automatic differentiation. Furthermore, the fixed weights in the loss function
are substituted with adaptive weights by incorporating the Lagrangian dual
method. Neural architecture search (NAS) is also introduced into the AutoKE to
select an optimal network architecture of the emulator according to the
specific problem. Finally, we apply transfer learning to enhance the
scalability of the emulator. In experiments, the framework is verified by a
series of physical problems in which it can automatically embed physical
knowledge into an emulator without heavy hand-coding. The results demonstrate
that the emulator can not only make accurate predictions, but also be applied
to similar problems with high efficiency via transfer learning.

evolution of globular clusters (GCs) and its first application to the study of
evolution of multiple stellar populations. We explore initial conditions
spanning different structural parameters for the first (FG) and second
generation of stars (SG) and we analyze their effect on the binary dynamics and
survival. Here, we focus on the number ratio of FG and SG binaries, its spatial
variation, and the way their abundances are affected by various cluster initial
properties. We find that present-day SG stars are more abundant in clusters
that were initially tidally filling. Conversely, FG stars stay more abundant in
clusters that were initially tidally underfilling. We find that the ratio
between binary fractions is not affected by the way we calculate these
fractions (e.g. only main-sequence binaries (MS) or observational binaries,
i.e. MS stars $> 0.4 M_{\odot}$ mass ratios $> 0.5$). This implies that the MS
stars themselves are a very good proxy for probing entire populations of FG and
SG. We also discuss how it relates to the observations of Milky Way GCs. We
show that \MOCCA models are able to reproduce the observed range of SG
fractions for Milky Way GCs for which we know these fractions. We show how the
SG fractions depend on the initial conditions and provide some constraints for
the initial conditions to have more numerous FG or SG stars at the Hubble time.

can be expressed as computing the satisfaction probability of a certain
property as a function of the parameters of the model. Smoothed model checking
(smMC) aims at inferring the satisfaction function over the entire parameter
space from a limited set of observations obtained via simulation. As
observations are costly and noisy, smMC is framed as a Bayesian inference
problem so that the estimates have an additional quantification of the
uncertainty. In smMC the authors use Gaussian Processes (GP), inferred by means
of the Expectation Propagation algorithm. This approach provides accurate
reconstructions with statistically sound quantification of the uncertainty.
However, it inherits the well-known scalability issues of GP. In this paper, we
exploit recent advances in probabilistic machine learning to push this
limitation forward, making Bayesian inference of smMC scalable to larger
datasets and enabling its application to models with high dimensional parameter
spaces. We propose Stochastic Variational Smoothed Model Checking (SV-smMC), a
solution that exploits stochastic variational inference (SVI) to approximate
the posterior distribution of the smMC problem. The strength and flexibility of
SVI make SV-smMC applicable to two alternative probabilistic models: Gaussian
Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). The core ingredient of SVI
is a stochastic gradient-based optimization that makes inference easily
parallelizable and that enables GPU acceleration. In this paper, we compare the
performances of smMC against those of SV-smMC by looking at the scalability,
the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the reconstructed satisfaction
function.

travels back in time along a closed timelike curve (CTC), typically concern
themselves with entirely classical histories, whereby any trajectorial effects
associated with quantum mechanics cannot manifest. Here we develop a quantum
version of the paradox, wherein a (semiclassical) wave packet evolves through a
region containing a wormhole time machine. This is accomplished by mapping all
relevant paths on to a quantum circuit, in which the distinction of the various
paths is facilitated by representing the billiard particle with a clock state.
For this model, we find that Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs) provides
self-consistent solutions in the form of a mixed state composed of terms which
represent every possible configuration of the particle's evolution through the
circuit. In the equivalent circuit picture (ECP), this reduces to a binomial
distribution in the number of loops of time machine. The postselected
teleportation prescription (P-CTCs) on the other hand predicts a pure-state
solution in which the loop counts have binomial coefficient weights. We then
discuss the model in the continuum limit, with a particular focus on the
various methods one may employ in order to guarantee convergence in the average
number of clock evolutions. Specifically, for D-CTCs, we find that it is
necessary to regularise the theory's parameters, while P-CTCs alternatively
require more contrived modification.

detecting strongly lensed GWs by galaxies has become a real possibility. Lens
galaxies also contain microlenses (e.g., stars and black holes), introducing
further frequency-dependent modulations in the strongly lensed GW signal within
the LIGO frequency range. The multiple lensed signals in a given lens system
have different underlying macro-magnifications ($|\mu|$) and are located in
varied microlens densities ($\Sigma_\bullet$), leading to different levels of
microlensing distortions. This work quantifies the fraction of strong lens
systems affected by microlensing using realistic mock observations. We study 50
quadruply imaged systems (quads) by generating 50 realizations for each lensed
signal. However, our conclusions are equally valid for lensed signals in doubly
imaged systems (doubles). The lensed signals studied here have $|\mu|\sim[0.5,
10]$ and $\Sigma_\bullet\sim[10, 10^3]~{\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$. We find that
the microlensing effects are more sensitive to the macro-magnification than the
underlying microlens density, even if the latter exceeds $10^3~{\rm

rarely exceeds $1\%$ for nearly all binary black hole sources in the total mass

expected to affect the detection or the parameter estimation of such signals

is expected to be satisfied by ${\sim}50\%$ of the detectable pairs in quads

been shown to have important impacts on the dynamics of pattern formation in
reaction-diffusion systems. In particular, past work has shown that such time
delays can shrink the Turing space, thereby inhibiting patterns from forming
across large ranges of parameters. Such delays can also increase the time taken
for pattern formation even when Turing instabilities occur. Here we consider
reaction-diffusion models incorporating fixed or distributed time delays,
modelling the underlying stochastic nature of gene expression dynamics, and
analyze these through a systematic linear instability analysis and numerical
simulations for several sets of different reaction kinetics. We find that even
complicated distribution kernels (skewed Gaussian probability density
functions) have little impact on the reaction-diffusion dynamics compared to
fixed delays with the same mean delay. We show that the location of the delay
terms in the model can lead to changes in the size of the Turing space
(increasing or decreasing) as the mean time delay, $\tau$, is increased. We
show that the time to pattern formation from a perturbation of the homogeneous
steady state scales linearly with $\tau$, and conjecture that this is a general
impact of time delay on reaction-diffusion dynamics, independent of the form of
the kinetics or location of the delayed terms. Finally we show that while
initial and boundary conditions can influence these dynamics, particularly the
time-to-pattern, the effects of delay appear robust under variations of initial
and boundary data. Overall our results help clarify the role of gene expression
time delays in reaction-diffusion patterning, and suggest clear directions for
further work in studying more realistic models of pattern formation.

then prove a generic no-go result that the maximally entangled state for any

However, such a state for even gons exhibits Hardy's nonlocality, and in that

extreme states in the elementary systems. Optimal Hardy's success probability
for the non-maximally entangled states is also studied that establishes the
presence of beyond quantum correlation in those systems, although the resulting

mixed states of these systems, unlike the two-qubit case, can depict Hardy's

searched from a set of data according to their shape, color, commercial sector,
semantics, general characteristics, or a combination of features selected by
the user. Unlike previous approaches, the proposal employs a series of
multi-label deep neural networks specialized in specific attributes and
combines the obtained features to perform the similarity search. To delve into
the classification system, different existing logo topologies are compared and
some of their problems are analyzed, such as the incomplete labeling that
trademark registration databases usually contain. The proposal is evaluated
considering 76,000 logos (7 times more than previous approaches) from the
European Union Trademarks dataset, which is organized hierarchically using the
Vienna ontology. Overall, experimentation attains reliable quantitative and
qualitative results, reducing the normalized average rank error of the
state-of-the-art from 0.040 to 0.018 for the Trademark Image Retrieval task.
Finally, given that the semantics of logos can often be subjective, graphic
design students and professionals were surveyed. Results show that the proposed

paradigm, implying that statistical homogeneity and isotropy may be reached
only on much larger scales than the usually assumed $\sim$100 Mpc. This means
that we are not necessarily typical observers and that the Copernican principle
could be recovered only on super-Hubble scales. Here, we do not assume the
validity of the Copernican principle and let Cosmic Microwave Background,
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, type Ia supernovae, local $H_0$, cosmic
chronometers, Compton y-distortion and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations
constrain the geometrical degrees of freedom of the local structure, which we
parametrize via the $\Lambda$LTB model -- basically a non-linear radial
perturbation of a FLRW metric. In order to quantify if a non-Copernican
structure could explain away the Hubble tension, we pay careful attention to
computing the Hubble constant in an inhomogeneous universe, and we adopt model
selection via both the Bayes factor and the Akaike information criterion. Our
results show that, while the $\Lambda$LTB model can successfully explain away
the $H_0$ tension, it is favored with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model only if
one solely considers supernovae in the redshift range that is used to fit the
Hubble constant, that is, $0.023<z<0.15$. If one considers all the supernova
sample, then the $H_0$ tension is not solved and the support for the
$\Lambda$LTB model vanishes. Combined with other data sets, this solution to
the Hubble tension barely helps. Finally, we have reconstructed our local
spacetime. We have found that data are best fit by a shallow void with
$\delta_L \approx -0.04$ and $r^{\mathrm{out}}_L \approx 300$ Mpc, which,

counterfactuals as real -- rather than hypothetical -- changes to defendants.
Once judges understood what the counterfactuals meant, they ignored them,
stating their role is only to make decisions regarding the actual defendant in
question. The judges also expressed a mix of reasons for ignoring or following
the advice of the PRAI without CFEs. These results add to the literature

deep learning based algorithms have revealed promise and performance in the

segmentation of images for automated corrosion detection has been limited, due
to the lack of availability of per-pixel labelled data sets which are required
for model training. Herein, a novel deep learning approach (termed RustSEG) is
presented, that can accurately segment images for automated corrosion
detection, without the requirement of per-pixel labelled data sets for
training. The RustSEG method will first, using deep learning techniques,
determine if corrosion is present in an image (i.e. a classification task), and
then if corrosion is present, the model will examine what pixels in the
original image contributed to that classification decision. Finally, the method
can refine its predictions into a pixel-level segmentation mask. In ideal
cases, the method is able to generate precise masks of corrosion in images,
demonstrating that the automated segmentation of corrosion without per-pixel

Our method ensures that environments within a norm-based tolerance are
classified as equivalent. During OLKMC simulations, our method guarantees to
elide the maximum number of redundant saddle-point searches in symmetrically
equivalent local-environments. Hence, we are able to study the
trapping/detrapping of hydrogen from up to five-vacancy clusters and
simultaneously the effect hydrogen has on the diffusivity of these clusters.
These processes occur at vastly different timescales at room temperature in
body-centred cubic iron. We are able to predict the diffusion pathways of
clusters/complexes without a priori assumptions of their mechanisms, not only
reproducing previously reported mechanisms but also discovering new ones for
larger complexes. We detail the hydrogen-induced changes in the clusters'
diffusion mechanisms and find evidence that, in contrast to mono-vacancies, the
introduction of hydrogen to larger clusters can increase their diffusivity. We
compare the effective hydrogen diffusivity to Oriani's classical theory of
trapping, finding general agreement and some evidence that hydrogen may not
always be in equilibrium with traps, when the traps are mobile. Finally, we are
able to compute the trapping atmosphere of meta-stable states surrounding
non-point traps, opening new avenues to better understand and predict hydrogen

nonnegative integer k, called the order or level of local testability, two
words u and v in some set of generators for semigroup S are equal in the
semigroup if (1) the prefix and suffix of the words of length k coincide, and
(2) the set of intermediate substrings of length k of the words coincide. The
local testability problem for semigroups is, given a finite semigroup, to
decide, if the semigroup is locally testable or not. Recently, we introduced a
polynomial time algorithm for the local testability problem and to find the
level of local testability for semigroups based on our previous description of
identities of $k$-testable semigroups and the structure of locally testable
semigroups. The first part of the algorithm we introduce solves the local
testability problem. The second part of the algorithm finds the order of local
testability of a semigroup. The algorithm is of quadratic order where n is the
order of the semigroup.

  Classifiers",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performance of text classification models tends to drop over time due to
changes in data, which limits the lifetime of a pretrained model. Therefore an
ability to predict a model's ability to persist over time can help design
models that can be effectively used over a longer period of time. In this
paper, we provide a thorough discussion into the problem, establish an
evaluation setup for the task. We look at this problem from a practical
perspective by assessing the ability of a wide range of language models and
classification algorithms to persist over time, as well as how dataset
characteristics can help predict the temporal stability of different models. We
perform longitudinal classification experiments on three datasets spanning
between 6 and 19 years, and involving diverse tasks and types of data. By
splitting the longitudinal datasets into years, we perform a comprehensive set
of experiments by training and testing across data that are different numbers
of years apart from each other, both in the past and in the future. This
enables a gradual investigation into the impact of the temporal gap between
training and test sets on the classification performance, as well as measuring
the extent of the persistence over time.

this. The transparency of DNS in handling the DNS records, also standardised
specifically for DNS [RFC3597], is one of the key features that made it such a
popular platform facilitating a constantly increasing number of new
applications. An application simply creates a new DNS record and can instantly
start distributing it over DNS without requiring any changes to the DNS servers
and platforms. Our Internet wide study confirms that more than 1.3M (96% of
tested) open DNS resolvers are standard compliant and treat DNS records
transparently.
  In this work we show that this `transparency' introduces a severe
vulnerability in the Internet: we demonstrate a new method to launch string
injection attacks by encoding malicious payloads into DNS records. We show how
to weaponise such DNS records to attack popular applications. For instance, we
apply string injection to launch a new type of DNS cache poisoning attack,
which we evaluated against a population of open resolvers and found 105K to be
vulnerable. Such cache poisoning cannot be prevented with common setups of
DNSSEC. Our attacks apply to internal as well as to public services, for
instance, we reveal that all eduroam services are vulnerable to our injection
attacks, allowing us to launch exploits ranging from unauthorised access to
eduroam networks to resource starvation. Depending on the application, our
attacks cause system crashes, data corruption and leakage, degradation of
security, and can introduce remote code execution and arbitrary errors.
  In our evaluation of the attacks in the Internet we find that all the
standard compliant open DNS resolvers we tested allow our injection attacks
against applications and users on their networks.

of gravitational red-shift and blue-shift on the entangled signal photons can
be canceled out, while the thermal photons only suffers from the gravitational

coupling non-linear electromagnetic effects to axion physics. We present a
number of motivations to justify the coupling of the axion to the photon in
terms of a general non-linear extension of the electromagnetic sector. Our
emphasis in the paper relies on the investigation of the constitutive
permittivity and permeability tensors, for which the axion contributes by
introducing dependence on the frequency and wave vector of the propagating
radiation. Also, we point out how the axion mass and the axion-photon-photon
coupling constant contribute to a dispersive behavior of the electromagnetic
waves, in contrast to what happens in the case of non-linear extensions, when
effective refractive indices appear which depend only on the direction of the
propagation with respect to the external fields. The axion changes this picture
by yielding refractive indices with dependence on the wavelength. We apply our
results to the special case of the (non-birefringent) Born-Infeld
Electrodynamics and we show that it becomes birefringent whenever the axion is
coupled. The paper is supplemented by an Appendix, where we follow our own path
to approach the recent discussion on a controversy in the definition of the
Poynting vector of axionic electrodynamics.

semi-structured data formats such as JSON. A disadvantage of such formats is
that an application may spend a significant amount of processing time just on
unselectively parsing all data. To relax this issue, the concept of raw
filtering is proposed with the idea to remove data from a stream prior to the
costly parsing stage. However, as accurate filtering of raw data is often only
possible after the data has been parsed, raw filters are designed to be
approximate in the sense of allowing false-positives in order to be implemented
efficiently.
  Contrary to previously proposed CPU-based raw filtering techniques that are
restricted to string matching, we present FPGA-based primitives for filtering
strings, numbers and also number ranges. In addition, a primitive respecting
the basic structure of JSON data is proposed that can be used to further
increase the accuracy of introduced raw filters.
  The proposed raw filter primitives are designed to allow for their
composition according to a given filter expression of a query. Thus, complex
raw filters can be created for FPGAs which enable a drastical decrease in the
amount of generated false-positives, particularly for IoT workload.
  As there exists a trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption, we
evaluate primitives as well as composed raw filters using different queries
from the RiotBench benchmark. Our results show that up to 94.3% of the raw data
can be filtered without producing any observed false-positives using only a few
hundred LUTs.

resonance modes differ from those predicted by the two-dimensional model and
the model of the unconfined bulk crystal. The features observed on the spectra
can be explained by the formation of chiral standing spin waves, which,
contrary to conventional standing spin waves, are characterized by the helical
profile of dynamic magnetization of fixed chirality defined by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In this case, the dynamic susceptibility
becomes a function of the plate thickness, which gives rise to an interesting
effect that manifests itself in periodical fading of the intensity of
corresponding modes and makes excitation of these modes impossible at specific
thicknesses.

appropriate measures. In addition, we exploit multiple approaches to adapt
multiclass incremental learning methods, commonly used in the continual visual
recognition, to the continual deepfake detection problem. We evaluate existing
methods, including their adapted ones, on the proposed CDDB. Within the

materials, forming a three-dimensional structure that remains incommensurate in
one direction parallel to the layers. As a consequence, no true bonding is
expected between the layers, with their interaction being dominated by charge
transfer. In contrast to this well-established picture, we show that interlayer
coupling can strongly influence the electronic properties of one type of layer
in a misfit structure, in a similar way to the creation of modified band
structures in an artificial moir\'e structure between two-dimensional
materials. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micron-scale
light focus, we selectively probe the electronic properties of hexagonal
NbSe$_2$ and square BiSe layers that terminate the surface of the
(BiSe)$_{1+\delta}$NbSe$_2$ misfit compound. We show that the band structure in
the BiSe layers is strongly affected by the presence of the hexagonal NbSe$_2$
layers, leading to quasi one-dimensional electronic features. The electronic
structure of the NbSe$_2$ layers, on the other hand, is hardly influenced by
the presence of the BiSe. Using density functional theory calculations of the
unfolded band structures, we argue that the preferred modification of one type
of bands is mainly due to the atomic and orbital character of the states
involved, opening a promising way to design novel electronic states that
exploit the partially incommensurate character of the misfit compounds.

'degenerate cavity laser', based on a unique cavity that self-images any
incident light-field onto itself. Placing a weak, critically-coupled absorber
into this cavity, we demonstrate that any incoming wavefront, even a complex

efficiency in a massively parallel interference process. Moreover, the coherent
nature of multi-mode absorption allows us to tune the degree of absorption over
a wide range. These characteristics open-up interesting new possibilities for

density, durability and sustainability. To read (and write) data DNA storage
exploits technology that has been developed over decades to sequence naturally
occurring DNA in the life sciences. To achieve higher accuracy for previously
unseen, biological DNA, sequencing relies on extending and training deep
machine learning models known as basecallers. This growth in model complexity
requires substantial resources, both computational and data sets. It also
eliminates the possibility of a compact read head for DNA as a storage medium.
  We argue that we need to depart from blindly using sequencing models from the
life sciences for DNA data storage. The difference is striking: for life
science applications we have no control over the DNA, however, in the case of
DNA data storage, we control how it is written, as well as the particular write
head. More specifically, data-carrying DNA can be modulated and embedded with
alignment markers and error correcting codes to guarantee higher fidelity and
to carry out some of the work that the machine learning models perform.
  In this paper, we study accuracy trade-offs between deep model size and error
correcting codes. We show that, starting with a model size of 107MB, the
reduced accuracy from model compression can be compensated by using simple
error correcting codes in the DNA sequences. In our experiments, we show that a
substantial reduction in the size of the model does not incur an undue penalty
for the error correcting codes used, therefore paving the way for portable
data-carrying DNA read head. Crucially, we show that through the joint use of
model compression and error correcting codes, we achieve a higher read accuracy

  of Objects","7 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Self-supervised grasp learning, i.e., learning to grasp by trial and error,
has made great progress. However, it is still time-consuming to train such a
model and also a challenge to apply it in practice. This work presents an
accelerating method of robotic grasp learning via pretraining with coarse
affordance maps of objects to be grasped based on a quite small dataset. A
model generated through pre-training is harnessed as an initialization policy
to warmly start grasp learning so as to guide a robot to capture more effective
rewards at the beginning of training. An object in its coarse affordance map is
annotated with a single key point and thereby, the burden of labeling is
greatly alleviated. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot are
conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation results show that it
can significantly accelerate grasp learning by nearly three times over a
vanilla Deep Q-Network -based method. Its test on a real UR3 robot shows that
it reaches a grasp success rate of 89.5% via only 500 times of grasp tries
within about two hours, which is four times faster than its competitor. In
addition, it enjoys an outstanding generalization ability to grasp prior-unseen
novel objects. It outperforms some existing methods and has the potential to
directly apply to a robot for real-world grasp learning tasks.

The conflict between group calibration vs. false positive and false negative
rate equality is one of the core issues in the debate about group fairness
definitions among practitioners. For any thorough moral analysis, the meaning
of the term fairness has to be made explicit and defined properly. For our
paper, we equate fairness with (non-)discrimination, which is a legitimate
understanding in the discussion about group fairness. More specifically, we
equate it with prima facie wrongful discrimination in the sense this is used in
Prof. Lippert-Rasmussen's treatment of this definition. In this paper, we argue
that a violation of group calibration may be unfair in some cases, but not
unfair in others. This is in line with claims already advanced in the
literature, that algorithmic fairness should be defined in a way that is
sensitive to context. The most important practical implication is that
arguments based on examples in which fairness requires between-group
calibration, or equality in the false-positive/false-negative rates, do no
generalize. For it may be that group calibration is a fairness requirement in
one case, but not in another.

understand transformation processes and control material properties. A
multimodal data fusion workflow directly combining subgrain data from electron
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and particle data from backscatter electron
(BSE) images in the scanning electron microscope is presented. The BSE images
provide detection of particles smaller than the applied step size of EBSD down
to 0.03 $\mu$m in diameter. The workflow is demonstrated on a cold-rolled and
recovered Al-Mn alloy, where constituent particles formed during casting and
dispersoids formed during subsequent heating affect recovery and
recrystallization upon annealing. The multimodal dataset enables statistical
analysis including subgrains surrounding constituent particles and dispersoids'
location with respect to subgrain boundaries. Among the subgrains of
recrystallization texture, Cube{001}$\left<100\right>$ subgrains experience an
increased Smith-Zener drag from dispersoids on their boundaries compared to
CubeND{001}$\left<310\right>$ and P{011}$\left<\bar{5}\bar{6}6\right>$

constituent particles are observed to have a growth advantage due to a lower
dislocation density and higher boundary misorientation angle. The dispersoid
size per subgrain boundary length increases as a function of misorientation
angle. The workflow should be applicable to other alloy systems where there is
a need for analysis correlating grains and grain boundaries with secondary
phases smaller than the applied EBSD step size but resolvable by BSE imaging.

would have changed its prediction in a particular way. CFEs have gained
considerable traction as a psychologically grounded solution for explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI). Recent innovations introduce the notion of
computational plausibility for automatically generated CFEs, enhancing their
robustness by exclusively creating plausible explanations. However, practical
benefits of such a constraint on user experience and behavior is yet unclear.
In this study, we evaluate objective and subjective usability of
computationally plausible CFEs in an iterative learning design targeting novice
users. We rely on a novel, game-like experimental design, revolving around an
abstract scenario. Our results show that novice users actually benefit less
from receiving computationally plausible rather than closest CFEs that produce
minimal changes leading to the desired outcome. Responses in a post-game survey
reveal no differences in terms of subjective user experience between both
groups. Following the view of psychological plausibility as comparative
similarity, this may be explained by the fact that users in the closest
condition experience their CFEs as more psychologically plausible than the
computationally plausible counterpart. In sum, our work highlights a
little-considered divergence of definitions of computational plausibility and
psychological plausibility, critically confirming the need to incorporate human
behavior, preferences and mental models already at the design stages of XAI
approaches. In the interest of reproducible research, all source code, acquired

a sequence of $n$ online i.i.d. random variables drawn from an unknown

irrevocably whether or not to accept it. The goal is to maximize the
competitive ratio between the expected gain of the gambler and that of the
maximum variable. It is shown by Correa et al. that when the distribution is
unknown or only $o(n)$ uniform samples from the distribution are given, the
best an algorithm can do is $1/e$-competitive. In contrast, when the
distribution is known or $\Omega(n)$ uniform samples are given, the optimal
competitive ratio 0.7451 can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a new model
in which the algorithm has access to an oracle that answers quantile queries
about the distribution, and study the extent to which we can use a small number
of queries to achieve good competitive ratios. Naturally, by making queries to
the oracle, one can implement the threshold-based blind strategies that use the
answers from the queries as thresholds to accept variables. Our first
contribution is to prove that the competitive ratio improves gracefully with
the number of thresholds. Particularly with two thresholds our algorithm
achieves a competitive ratio of 0.6786. Our second contribution, surprisingly,
shows that with a single query, we can do strictly better than with a single
threshold. The algorithm sets a threshold in the first phase by making a single
query and uses the maximum realization from the first phase as the threshold
for the second phase. It can be viewed as a natural combination of the
single-threshold algorithm and the algorithm for the secretary problem. By
properly choosing the quantile to query and the break-point between the two
phases, we achieve a competitive ratio of 0.6718.

Python advantages in terms of code re-usability, portability while facilitating
the interoperability with other FDE implementations available through the PyADF

scales approximately linearly both with the size of the frozen surrounding

size of the active system (in line with the use of density fitting). Finally,
we applied the code to a series of Heavy (Rn) and Super-Heavy elements (Cn, Fl,

However, a less explored area is the study of their potential fault tolerance

to actuator failures, benefiting from the configuration redundancy. The
proposed approach is lightweight and is implemented as an extension to an
already-existing flight control stack. Extensive experiments validate that the

field which has shown impressive performance on a number of natural language
tasks with common benchmarking text datasets in full, few-shot, and zero-shot
train-evaluation setups. Recently, it has even been observed that large but
frozen pre-trained language models (PLMs) with prompt learning outperform
smaller but fine-tuned models. However, as with many recent NLP trends, the
performance of even the largest PLMs such as GPT-3 do not perform well on
specialized domains (e.g. medical text), and the common practice to achieve
State of the Art (SoTA) results still consists of pre-training and fine-tuning
the PLMs on downstream tasks. The reliance on fine-tuning large PLMs is
problematic in clinical settings where data is often held in non-GPU
environments, and more resource efficient methods of training specialized
domain models is crucial. We investigated the viability of prompt learning on
clinically meaningful decision tasks and directly compared with more
traditional fine-tuning methods. Results are partially in line with the prompt
learning literature, with prompt learning able to match or improve on
traditional fine-tuning with substantially fewer trainable parameters and
requiring less training data. We argue that prompt learning therefore provides
lower computational resource costs applicable to clinical settings, that can
serve as an alternative to fine-tuning ever increasing in size PLMs.

dark matter (DM) with baryons. Availability of high-precision data requires a
critical reassessment of any assumptions that may impact the accuracy of
constraints. The standard formalism for constraining DM-baryon scattering
pre-recombination is based on assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity
distribution for DM. This assumption is not always justified and does not allow
for probing DM self-interactions in addition to its interactions with baryons.
Lifting the MB assumption requires solving the full collisional Boltzmann
equation (CBE), which is highly non-trivial. Earlier work proposed a more
tractable Fokker-Planck (FP) approximation to the CBE, but its accuracy
remained unknown. In this work, we numerically solve the exact CBE for the
first time, in a homogeneous expanding background. We consider DM-baryon
scattering cross-sections that are positive power-laws of relative velocity. We
derive analytical expressions for the collision operator in the case of
isotropic differential scattering cross-sections. We then solve the background
CBE numerically and use our solution for the DM velocity distribution to
compute the DM-baryon heat-exchange rate, which we compare against those
obtained with the MB assumption and FP approximation. Over a broad range of
DM-to-baryon mass ratios, we find that the FP approximation leads to a maximum
error of 17%, significantly better than the up to 160% error introduced by the
MB assumption. While our results strictly apply only to the background
evolution, the accuracy of the FP approximation is likely to carry over to
perturbations. This motivates its implementation into cosmological Boltzmann
codes, where it can supersede the much less accurate MB assumption, and allow
for a more general exploration of DM interactions with baryons and with itself.

  Vidapanakal","NMR: Neural Manifold Representation for Autonomous Driving",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Autonomous driving requires efficient reasoning about the Spatio-temporal
nature of the semantics of the scene. Recent approaches have successfully
amalgamated the traditional modular architecture of an autonomous driving stack
comprising perception, prediction, and planning in an end-to-end trainable
system. Such a system calls for a shared latent space embedding with
interpretable intermediate trainable projected representation. One such
successfully deployed representation is the Bird's-Eye View(BEV) representation
of the scene in ego-frame. However, a fundamental assumption for an undistorted
BEV is the local coplanarity of the world around the ego-vehicle. This
assumption is highly restrictive, as roads, in general, do have gradients. The
resulting distortions make path planning inefficient and incorrect. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Neural Manifold Representation (NMR), a
representation for the task of autonomous driving that learns to infer
semantics and predict way-points on a manifold over a finite horizon, centered
on the ego-vehicle. We do this using an iterative attention mechanism applied
on a latent high dimensional embedding of surround monocular images and partial
ego-vehicle state. This representation helps generate motion and behavior plans
consistent with and cognizant of the surface geometry. We propose a sampling
algorithm based on edge-adaptive coverage loss of BEV occupancy grid and
associated guidance flow field to generate the surface manifold while incurring
minimal computational overhead. We aim to test the efficacy of our approach on
CARLA and SYNTHIA-SF.

automatic detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) on a dataset of
colour fundus images acquired during routine clinical practice in a tertiary
hospital screening program, analyzing the reduction of workload that can be
released incorporating this artificial intelligence-based technology. Methods:
Evaluation of the software was performed on a dataset of 7195 nonmydriatic
fundus images from 6325 eyes of 3189 diabetic patients attending our screening
program between February to December of 2019. The software generated a DR
severity score for each colour fundus image which was combined into an
eye-level score. This score was then compared with a reference standard as set
by a human expert using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
Results: The artificial intelligence (AI) software achieved an area under the
ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.988 [0.981:0.993] for the detection of referable DR.
At the proposed operating point, the sensitivity of the RetCAD software for DR
is 90.53% and specificity is 97.13%. A workload reduction of 96% could be
achieved at the cost of only 6 false negatives. Conclusions: The AI software
correctly identified the vast majority of referable DR cases, with a workload
reduction of 96% of the cases that would need to be checked, while missing
almost no true cases, so it may therefore be used as an instrument for triage.

approximate neutrino-radiation transfer, the properties of ejecta in dynamical
and post-merger phases are investigated for the cases in which the remnant
massive neutron star collapses into a black hole in $\lesssim 20$ ms after the
onset of the merger. The dynamical mass ejection is investigated in
three-dimensional simulations. The post-merger mass ejection is investigated in
two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with viscosity using the
three-dimensional post-merger systems as the initial conditions. We show that
the typical neutron-richness of the dynamical ejecta is higher for the merger
of more asymmetric binaries; hence, heavier $r$-process nuclei are dominantly
synthesized. The post-merger ejecta are shown to have only a mild
neutron-richness, which results in the production of lighter $r$-process
nuclei, irrespective of binary mass ratios. Because of the larger disk mass,
the post-merger ejecta mass is larger for more asymmetric binary mergers. Thus,
the post-merger ejecta can compensate for the underproduced lighter $r$-process
nuclei for asymmetric merger cases. As a result, by summing up both ejecta
components, the solar residual $r$-process pattern is reproduced within the
average deviation of a factor of three, irrespective of the binary mass ratio.
Our result also indicates that the (about a factor of a few) light-to-heavy
abundance scatter observed in $r$-process-enhanced stars can be attributed to
variation in the binary mass ratio and total mass. Implications of our results
associated with the mass distribution of compact neutron star binaries and the
magnetar scenario of short gamma-ray bursts are discussed.

detection devices. Panoramic imaging emerges as the next generation of
innovative intelligent instruments for environmental perception and
measurement. However, while satisfying the need for large-FoV photographic
imaging, panoramic imaging instruments are expected to have high resolution, no
blind area, miniaturization, and multidimensional intelligent perception, and
can be combined with artificial intelligence methods towards the next
generation of intelligent instruments, enabling deeper understanding and more
holistic perception of 360-degree real-world surrounding environments.
Fortunately, recent advances in freeform surfaces, thin-plate optics, and
metasurfaces provide innovative approaches to address human perception of the
environment, offering promising ideas beyond conventional optical imaging. In
this review, we begin with introducing the basic principles of panoramic
imaging systems, and then describe the architectures, features, and functions
of various panoramic imaging systems. Afterwards, we discuss in detail the
broad application prospects and great design potential of freeform surfaces,
thin-plate optics, and metasurfaces in panoramic imaging. We then provide a
detailed analysis on how these techniques can help enhance the performance of
panoramic imaging systems. We further offer a detailed analysis of applications
of panoramic imaging in scene understanding for autonomous driving and
robotics, spanning panoramic semantic image segmentation, panoramic depth
estimation, panoramic visual localization, and so on. Finally, we cast a
perspective on future potential and research directions for panoramic imaging
instruments.

constraining the mass and/or radius of neutron stars (NSs) or black holes (BHs)
in eclipsing binaries and probing any structure surrounding the companion star.
In eclipsing systems, the binary inclination, $i$, and mass ratio, $q$ relate
via the duration of totality, $t_{e}$. The degeneracy between $i$ and $q$ can
then be broken through detailed modelling of the eclipse profile. Here we model
the eclipses of the NS low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1858.6$-$0814 utilising
archival NICER observations taken while the source was in outburst. Analogous
to EXO 0748$-$676, we find evidence for irradiation driven ablation of the
companion's surface by requiring a layer of stellar material to surround the
companion star in our modelling. This material layer extends $\sim 7000 -
14000$ km from the companion's surface and is likely the cause of the extended,
energy-dependent and asymmetric ingress and egress that we observe. Our fits
return an inclination of $i \sim 81^{\circ}$ and a mass ratio $q \sim 0.14$.
Using Kepler's law to relate the mass and radius of the companion star via the
orbital period ($\sim$ 21.3 hrs), we subsequently determine the companion to
have a low mass in the range $0.183 M_{\odot} \leq M_{cs} \leq 0.372 M_{\odot}$
and a large radius in the range $1.02 R_{\odot} \leq R_{cs} \leq 1.29
R_{\odot}$. Our results, combined with future radial velocity amplitudes
measured from stellar absorption/emission lines, can place precise constraints
on the component masses in this system.

to generically be a phase transition in the directed percolation universality

the first-ever dynamical mechanism for puff proliferation -- the process by
which a puff splits into two. In the first stage of our mechanism, a puff
expands into a slug. In the second stage, a laminar gap is formed within the
turbulent core. The notion of a split-edge state, mediating the transition from
a single puff to a two puff state, is introduced and its form is predicted. The
role of fluctuations in the two stages of the transition, and how splits could
be suppressed with increasing Reynolds number, are discussed. Using numerical

permutation training speech enhancement (SE) method (PVAE) which indicated that
the SE performance of the traditional deep neural network-based (DNN) method
could be improved by deep representation learning (DRL). Based on our previous
work, we in this paper propose to use $\beta$-VAE to further improve PVAE's
ability of representation learning. More specifically, our $\beta$-VAE can
improve PVAE's capacity of disentangling different latent variables from the
observed signal without the trade-off problem between disentanglement and
signal reconstruction. This trade-off problem widely exists in previous
$\beta$-VAE algorithms. Unlike the previous $\beta$-VAE algorithms, the
proposed $\beta$-VAE strategy can also be used to optimize the DNN's structure.
This means that the proposed method can not only improve PVAE's SE performance
but also reduce the number of PVAE training parameters. The experimental
results show that the proposed method can acquire better speech and noise
latent representation than PVAE. Meanwhile, it also obtains a higher
scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio, speech quality, and speech
intelligibility.

behaviors but faces two main challenges: data incompleteness and computational
burden. For many imaging systems, high frame rates and short acquisition times
require severe undersampling, which leads to data incompleteness. Multiple
images may then be compatible with the data, thus requiring special techniques
(regularization) to ensure the uniqueness of the reconstruction. Computational
and memory requirements are particularly burdensome for three-dimensional
dynamic imaging applications requiring high resolution in both space and time.
Exploiting redundancies in the object's spatiotemporal features is key to
addressing both challenges. This contribution investigates neural fields, or
implicit neural representations, to model the sought-after dynamic object.
Neural fields are a particular class of neural networks that represent the
dynamic object as a continuous function of space and time, thus avoiding the
burden of storing a full resolution image at each time frame. Neural field
representation thus reduces the image reconstruction problem to estimating the
network parameters via a nonlinear optimization problem (training). Once
trained, the neural field can be evaluated at arbitrary locations in space and
time, allowing for high-resolution rendering of the object. Key advantages of
the proposed approach are that neural fields automatically learn and exploit
redundancies in the sought-after object to both regularize the reconstruction
and significantly reduce memory storage requirements. The feasibility of the
proposed framework is illustrated with an application to dynamic image
reconstruction from severely undersampled circular Radon transform data.

soft-select the appropriate face video track. Experiments carried out on an A/V

dynamics library to incorporate the vectorized solvers, and we compared the
accuracy of a fourth-order linearly implicit integrator -- both in vectorized
form and a corresponding method native to OpenFOAM -- with the community
standard chemical kinetics library Cantera. We then applied our methodology to

performance of the vectorized and native OpenFOAM integrators over the studied

33--35x faster than the native OpenFOAM solver with high accuracy.

traditionally studied in isolation assuming the video of a single speaking face

multiple people are on screen was put aside as a separate problem. As an
alternative, recent work has proposed to address the two problems
simultaneously with an attention mechanism, baking the speaker selection
problem directly into a fully differentiable model. One interesting finding was
that the attention indirectly learns the association between the audio and the
speaking face even though this correspondence is never explicitly provided at
training time. In the present work we further investigate this connection and
examine the interplay between the two problems. With experiments involving over
50 thousand hours of public YouTube videos as training data, we first evaluate
the accuracy of the attention layer on an active speaker selection task.
Secondly, we show under closer scrutiny that an end-to-end model performs at

uses a repeating structure that analyzes the known irregular contour
coordinates to approximate the physical domain contour by mesh segments. To
this end, the algorithm calculates the slope of the line defined by the known

algorithm calculates the points of the line and its distance to the closest
known nodes of the mesh, allowing to obtain the points of the approximate

Therefore, this approximate contour generation algorithm, from known nodes of a

contour is evaluated through three geometries, the difference between the areas
delimited by the given contour and the approximate contour, the number of nodes

complexity implies the need for a greater number of nodes in the contour,

Contrastive Graph Clustering (SCGC) algorithm to improve the existing methods
from the perspectives of network architecture, data augmentation, and objective
function. As to the architecture, our network includes two main parts, i.e.,
pre-processing and network backbone. A simple low-pass denoising operation
conducts neighbor information aggregation as an independent pre-processing, and
only two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are included as the backbone. For data
augmentation, instead of introducing complex operations over graphs, we
construct two augmented views of the same vertex by designing parameter
un-shared siamese encoders and corrupting the node embeddings directly.
Finally, as to the objective function, to further improve the clustering
performance, a novel cross-view structural consistency objective function is
designed to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned network.
Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets validate our
proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority. Significantly, our
algorithm outperforms the recent contrastive deep clustering competitors with
at least seven times speedup on average.

categorization from EEG data has recently gotten a lot of attention.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are a critical resource for these systems.
The primary benefit of employing EEG signals is that they reflect true emotion
and are easily resolved by computer systems. In this work, EEG signals
associated with good, neutral, and negative emotions were identified using
channel selection preprocessing. However, researchers had a limited grasp of
the specifics of the link between various emotional states until now. To
identify EEG signals, we used discrete wavelet transform and machine learning
techniques such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN)

selection. As a result, final feature vectors were created by integrating the
features of EEG segments from these channels. Using the RNN and kNN algorithms,
the final feature vectors with connected positive, neutral, and negative

computational biology. The problem of protein structure prediction is about
predicting the native conformation of a protein, while its sequence of amino
acids is known. Regarding processing limitations of current computer systems,
all-atom simulations for proteins are typically unpractical; several reduced
models of proteins have been proposed. Additionally, due to intrinsic hardness
of calculations even in reduced models, many computational methods mainly based
on artificial intelligence have been proposed to solve the problem. Agent-based
modeling is a relatively new method for modeling systems composed of
interacting items. In this paper we proposed a new approach for protein
structure prediction by using agent-based modeling (ABM) in two dimensional
hydrophobic-hydrophilic model. We broke the whole process of protein structure
prediction into two steps: the first step, which was introduced in our previous
paper, is about biasing the linear sequence to gain a primary energy, and the
next step, which will be explained in this paper, is about using ABM with a
predefined set of rules, to find the best conformation in the least possible
amount of time and steps. This method was implemented in NETLOGO. We have
tested this algorithm on several benchmark sequences ranging from 20 to 50-mers
in two dimensional Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic lattice models. Comparing to the
result of the other algorithms, our method is capable of finding the best known
conformations in a significantly shorter time. A major problem in PSP
simulation is that as the sequence length increases the time consumed to
predict a valid structure will exponentially increase. In contrast, by using
MAS2HP the effect of increase in sequence length on spent time has changed from
exponentially to linear.

sourcecode understanding. Our method leverages the contextual and the
structural information available from the code snippet by treating each snippet
as a two-dimensional image, which naturally encodes the context and retains the
underlying structural information through an explicit spatial representation.
To codify snippets as images, we propose an ASCII codepoint-based image
representation that facilitates fast generation of sourcecode images and
eliminates redundancy in the encoding that would arise from an RGB pixel
representation. Furthermore, as sourcecode is treated as images, neither
lexical analysis (tokenisation) nor syntax tree parsing is required, which
makes the proposed method agnostic to any particular programming language and
lightweight from the application pipeline point of view. CV4Code can even
featurise syntactically incorrect code which is not possible from methods that
depend on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CV4Code by learning Convolutional and Transformer networks to predict the
functional task, i.e. the problem it solves, of the source code directly from
its two-dimensional representation, and using an embedding from its latent

However, the number of labeled pixels is very limited in HSI, and thus the

inevitably degrade the representation ability of most existing GCN-based
methods. To enhance the feature representation ability, in this paper, a GCN
model with contrastive learning is proposed to explore the supervision signals
contained in both spectral information and spatial relations, which is termed
Contrastive Graph Convolutional Network (ConGCN), for HSI classification.
First, in order to mine sufficient supervision signals from spectral
information, a semi-supervised contrastive loss function is utilized to
maximize the agreement between different views of the same node or the nodes
from the same land cover category. Second, to extract the precious yet implicit
spatial relations in HSI, a graph generative loss function is leveraged to
explore supplementary supervision signals contained in the graph topology. In
addition, an adaptive graph augmentation technique is designed to flexibly
incorporate the spectral-spatial priors of HSI, which helps facilitate the
subsequent contrastive representation learning. The extensive experimental
results on four typical benchmark datasets firmly demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed ConGCN in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.

we present an updated computational model for simulating smoldering combustion
in cellulose and hemicellulose mixtures. We used this model to examine changes
in smoldering propagation speed and peak temperatures with varying fuel
composition and density. For a given fuel composition, increases in density
decrease the propagation speed and increase mean peak temperature; for a given
density, increases in hemicellulose content increase both propagation speed and
peak temperature. We also examined the role of natural fuel expansion with the
addition of water. Without expansion, addition of moisture content reduces the
propagation speed primarily due to increasing (wet) fuel density. However, with
fuel expansion similar to that observed in peat, the propagation speed
increases due to the overall drop in fuel density. Finally, we studied the
influence of fuel composition on critical moisture content of ignition and
extinction: mixtures dominated by hemicellulose have 10% higher critical
moisture content due to the increase in peak temperature.

trading and investments. The growing popularity of speculative trading of
highly volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks presents a
fresh challenge in the financial realm. Investigating such ""bubbles"" - periods
of sudden anomalous behavior of markets are critical in better understanding
investor behavior and market dynamics. However, high volatility coupled with
massive volumes of chaotic social media texts, especially for underexplored
assets like cryptocoins pose a challenge to existing methods. Taking the first
step towards NLP for cryptocoins, we present and publicly release
CryptoBubbles, a novel multi-span identification task for bubble detection, and
a dataset of more than 400 cryptocoins from 9 exchanges over five years
spanning over two million tweets. Further, we develop a set of
sequence-to-sequence hyperbolic models suited to this multi-span identification
task based on the power-law dynamics of cryptocurrencies and user behavior on
social media. We further test the effectiveness of our models under zero-shot
settings on a test set of Reddit posts pertaining to 29 ""meme stocks"", which
see an increase in trade volume due to social media hype. Through quantitative,
qualitative, and zero-shot analyses on Reddit and Twitter spanning cryptocoins
and meme-stocks, we show the practical applicability of CryptoBubbles and
hyperbolic models.

tasks, with applications in many different domains. In this work we carry out a
first study on GPT-3's capability to communicate musical decisions through
textual explanations when prompted with a textual representation of a piece of
music. Enabling a dialogue in human-AI music partnerships is an important step
towards more engaging and creative human-AI interactions. Our results show that
GPT-3 lacks the necessary intelligence to really understand musical decisions.
A major barrier to reach a better performance is the lack of data that includes
explanations of the creative process carried out by artists for musical pieces.
We believe such a resource would aid the understanding and collaboration with
AI music systems.
