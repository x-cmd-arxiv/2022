elements (MPs) that are difficult to explain in a coherent formation scenario.
In recent years, HST photometry has led to the characterisation of the global
properties of th MPs in an unparalleled level of detail. In particular, the
colour-colour diagrams known as chromosome maps have been proven to be very
efficient at separating cluster stars with field-like metal abundance
distribution (1P) from object with distinctive light-element abundance
anti-correlations (2P). The unexpected wide colour ranges covered by the 1P
group in the chromosome maps of the majority of the investigated Galactic GCs
have been recently attributed to intrinsic metallicity variations up to ~0.30
dex, from the study of SGB stars in two metal rich Galactic GCs by employing
appropriate HST filter combinations. On the other hand, high-resolution
spectroscopy of small samples of 1P stars in NGC 3201 and NGC 2808 have so far
provided conflicting results, with a spread of metallicity detected in NGC 3201
but not in NGC 2808. We present a new method that employs HST near-UV and
optical photometry of RGB stars, to independently confirm these results. Our
approach has been firstly validated using observational data for M2, a GC
hosting a small group of 1P stars with enhanced (by ~0.5 dex) metallicity with
respect to the main component. We have then applied our method to three
clusters that cover a much larger metallicity range, and have well populated,
extended first population sequences in their chromosome maps, namely M92,
NGC2808, and NGC6362. We confirm that metallicity spreads are present among 1P
stars in these clusters, thus solidifying the case for the existence of
unexpected variations up to a factor of two of metal abundances in most GCs. We
also confirm the complex behaviour of the mean metallicity differences between
1P and 2P stars.

topological superconductors, it is conceivable that the quantum states in these
finite adjacent materials can intermix. In this case -- and because the NM
usually does not possess the same symmetry as the topological material -- it is
pertinent to ask whether zero-energy edge states in the topological layer are
affected by the presence of the NM. To address this issue, we consider three
prototype systems simulated by tight-binding models, namely a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger/NM, a Kitaev/NM, and a Chern insulator/NM. For all
junctions investigated, we find that there exist trivial ``fine-tuned''
zero-energy states in the NM layer that can percolate into the topological
region, thus mimicking a topological state. These zero-energy states are
created by fine-tuning the NM chemical potential such that some of the NM
states cross zero energy; they can occur even when the topological material is
in the topologically trivial phase, and exist over a large region of the
topological phase diagram. Interestingly, the true Majorana end modes of the
Kitaev/NM model cannot be crossed by any NM state, as the NM metal layer in
this case does not break particle-hole symmetry. On the other hand, when the
chiral symmetry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is broken by the attached NM,
crossings are allowed. In addition, even in Chern insulators that do not
preserve nonspatial symmetries, but the topological edge state self-generates a
symmetry eigenvalue, such a fine-tuned zero-energy state can still occur. Our
results indicate that when a topological material is attached to a metallic
layer, one has to be cautious as to identify true topological edge states
merely from their energy spectra and wave function profiles near the interface.

distill and concentrate specific chemical factors in appropriate cell membrane
subregions, thus endowing them with different chemical identities and
functional properties. A phenomenological theory of this molecular distillation
process has recently been proposed [arXiv:1811.06760], based on the idea that
molecular sorting emerges from the combination of: a) phase-separation-driven
formation of sorting domains, and b) domain-induced membrane bending, leading
to the production of submicrometric lipid vesicles enriched in the sorted
molecules. In this framework, a natural parameter controlling the efficiency of
molecular distillation is the critical size of phase-separated domains. In the
experiments, sorting domains appear to fall into two classes: unproductive
domains, characterized by short lifetimes and low probability of extraction,
and productive domains, that evolve into vesicles that ultimately detach from
the membrane system. It is tempting to link these two classes to the different
fates predicted by classical phase separation theory for subcritical and
supercritical phase-separated domains. Here, we discuss the implication of this
picture in the framework of the previously introduced phenomenological theory
of molecular sorting. Several predictions of the theory are verified by
numerical simulations of a lattice-gas model. Sorting is observed to be most
efficient when the number of sorting domains is close to a minimum. To help in
the analysis of experimental data, an operational definition of the critical
size of sorting domains is proposed. Comparison with experimental results shows
that the statistical properties of productive/unproductive domains inferred

insufficient photons and undesirable noise. To enhance object detection in a

translation. In a self-supervision manner, the MAET learns the intrinsic visual

  Based on this representation, we achieve the object detection task by
decoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the
over-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading
features by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric
manifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by
maximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of
respective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream
object detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using normal
target detection datasets, such as VOC and COCO. We have achieved the

In this work we investigate ways to minimize online interactions in a target

training on related prior tasks, or in simulation. To this end, we develop two
RL algorithms that can speed up training by using not only the action
distributions of teacher policies, but also data collected by such policies on
the task at hand. We conduct a thorough experimental study of how to use
suboptimal teachers on a challenging robotic manipulation benchmark on
vision-based stacking with diverse objects. We compare our methods to offline,
online, offline-to-online, and kickstarting RL algorithms. By doing so, we find
that training on data from both the teacher and student, enables the best
performance for limited data budgets. We examine how to best allocate a limited
data budget -- on the target task -- between the teacher and the student
policy, and report experiments using varying budgets, two teachers with
different degrees of suboptimality, and five stacking tasks that require a
diverse set of behaviors. Our analysis, both in simulation and in the real

offline RL from teacher rollouts is surprisingly effective when enough data is

by dark matter annihilation or decay has to cope with the extreme faintness of
the predicted signal and the presence of masking astrophysical backgrounds. It
has been shown that using the correlated information between the dark matter
distribution in the Universe with the fluctuations of the cosmic radiation
fields has the potential to allow setting apart a pure dark matter signal from
astrophysical emissions, since spatial fluctuations in the radiation field due
to astrophysical sources and dark matter emission have different features. The
cross-correlation technique has been proposed and adopted for dark matter
studies by looking at dark matter halos (overdensities). In this paper we
extend the technique by focusing on the information on dark matter distribution
offered by cosmic voids, and by looking specifically at the gamma-ray dark
matter emission: we show that, while being underdense and therefore producing a
reduced emission as compared to halos, nevertheless in voids the relative size
of the cross-correlation signal due to decaying dark matter vs. astrophysical
sources is significantly more favourable, producing signal-to-background ratios
$S/B$ (even significantly) larger than 1 for decay lifetimes up to $2 \times
10^{30}$ s. This is at variance with the case of halos, where $S/B$ is
typically (even much) smaller than 1. We show that forthcoming galaxy surveys
such as Euclid combined with future generation gamma-ray detectors with
improved specifications have the ability to provide a hint of such a signal
with a predicted significance up to $5.7\sigma$ for galaxies and $1.6\sigma$

exploiting voids is predicted to improve on current bounds in a mass range for

the next generation of medical x-ray imaging. Evaluating their performance in
terms of the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) requires normalization of the
frequency-dependent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by that of an ideal SXD. We
provide mathematical expressions of the SNR of ideal SXDs for quantification
and detection tasks and tabulate their numeric values for standardized tasks.
We propose using standardized RQA-series x-ray spectra. We define ideal SXDs as
those that (1) have an infinite number of infinitesimal energy bins, (2) do not
distort the incident distribution of x-ray photons in the spatial or energy
domains, and (3) do not decrease the frequency-dependent SNR of the incident
distribution of x-ray quanta. We derive analytic expressions for the noise
power spectrum (NPS) of such ideal detectors for detection and quantification
tasks. We tabulate the NPS of ideal SXDs for RQA x-ray spectra for detection
and quantification of aluminum, PMMA, iodine, and gadolinium basis materials.
Our analysis shows that a single matrix determines the noise power of ideal
SXDs in detection and quantification tasks, including basis material
decomposition and line-integral estimation for pseudo-mono-energetic imaging.
This NPS matrix is determined by the x-ray spectrum incident on the detector
and the mass-attenuation coefficients of the set of basis materials. Combining
existing tabulated values of the mass-attenuation coefficients of basis
materials with standardized RQA x-ray spectra enabled tabulating numeric values
of the NPS matrix for selected spectra and tasks. The numeric values and
mathematical expressions of the NPS of ideal SXDs reported here can be used to

has been studied extensively in the past decade. In particular, various models
of stochastic particle motion were considered where upon resetting the particle
is returned to its initial position. Here we generalize the model of diffusion
with resetting to account for situations where a particle is returned only a
fraction of its distance to the origin, e.g., half way. We show that this model
always attains a steady-state distribution which can be written as an infinite
sum of independent, but not identical, Laplace random variables. As a result,
we find that the steady-state transitions from the known Laplace form which is
obtained in the limit of full resetting to a Gaussian form which is obtained
close to the limit of no resetting. A similar transition is shown to be
displayed by drift-diffusion whose steady-state can also be expressed as an
infinite sum of independent random variables. Finally, we extend our analysis
to capture the temporal evolution of drift-diffusion with partial resetting,
providing a bottom-up probabilistic construction that yields a closed form
solution for the time dependent distribution of this process in Fourier-Laplace
space. Possible extensions and applications of diffusion with partial resetting
are discussed.

evidence that the Lloyd bound is satisfied by the volume complexity rate in all

complexity rate diverges at the critical time $t_c$ for which the
Wheeler-DeWitt patch touches the singularity. After the critical time the
action complexity rate approaches a constant. We find that the Kasner exponent
does not directly affect the details of the divergence of the complexity rate

violated by action complexity at finite time, because the complexity rate
diverges at $t=t_c$. We find that the Lloyd bound is satisfied by the

objects in determining the scene scheme varies greatly; 2) many objects
irrelevant to the scene scheme are often flooded in the image. Hence, how to
effectively perceive the region of interests (RoIs) from a variety of sizes and
build more discriminative representation from such complicated object
distribution is vital to understand an aerial scene. In this paper, we propose
a novel all grains, one scheme (AGOS) framework to tackle these challenges. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to extend the classic multiple
instance learning into multi-grain formulation. Specially, it consists of a
multi-grain perception module (MGP), a multi-branch multi-instance
representation module (MBMIR) and a self-aligned semantic fusion (SSF) module.
Firstly, our MGP preserves the differential dilated convolutional features from
the backbone, which magnifies the discriminative information from multi-grains.
Then, our MBMIR highlights the key instances in the multi-grain representation
under the MIL formulation. Finally, our SSF allows our framework to learn the
same scene scheme from multi-grain instance representations and fuses them, so
that the entire framework is optimized as a whole. Notably, our AGOS is
flexible and can be easily adapted to existing CNNs in a plug-and-play manner.
Extensive experiments on UCM, AID and NWPU benchmarks demonstrate that our AGOS
achieves a comparable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

pre-trained on base classes with abundant data and then transferred to novel
classes with a few annotated samples. Despite the substantial progress, the
FSOD performance is still far behind satisfactory. During pre-training, due to
the co-occurrence between base and novel classes, the model is learned to treat
the co-occurred novel classes as backgrounds. During transferring, given scarce
samples of novel classes, the model suffers from learning discriminative
features to distinguish novel instances from backgrounds and base classes. To
overcome the obstacles, we propose a novel framework, Mining Implicit Novel

offline mining mechanism leverages a self-supervised discriminative model to

Taking the mined novel instances as auxiliary training samples, the online
mining mechanism takes a teacher-student framework to simultaneously update the

model, which assumes that the radio emission originates from thermal free-free
and gyroresonance processes, we calculate radio brightness temperature maps
that can be compared with the observations. The magnetic field at distinct
atmospheric heights was determined in our modelling process by force-free field
extrapolation using photospheric magnetograms taken by HMI/SDO. In order to
determine the best plasma temperature and density height profiles necessary to
match the observations, the model uses a genetic algorithm that modifies a
standard quiet Sun atmospheric model. Our results show that the height of the
transition region (TR) of the modelled atmosphere varies with the type of
region being modelled: for umbrae the TR is located at 1080 +/- 20 km above the
solar surface; for penumbrae, the TR is located at 1800 +/- 50 km; and for
bright regions outside sunspots, the TR is located at 2000 +/- 100 km. With
these results, we find good agreement with the observed AR brightness
temperature maps. Our modelled AR can be used to estimate the emission at

standard approaches, the use of SMBH has the advantage of not needing to be

physical size can be estimated knowing the mass of the SMBH. Furthermore, SMBH
are supposed to inhabit the center of all galaxies which, in principle, means
that we can measure the size of the shadows in any Supernova type Ia host
galaxy. Under the assumption that the mass of the SMBH can be accurately and
reliably estimated, we find that the Hubble constant can be constrained with a
$\approx10\%$ precision even considering current experimental design of
ground-based interferometers. By constructing a SMBH catalogue based on a
specific choice of the SMBH Mass Function (BHMF), we forecast the constraints

arrive at the source at arbitrary time instants. For each update, its size,
i.e. the service time required for complete transmission to the destination, is
also arbitrary. At any time, age of information (AoI) is equal to the
difference between the current time, and the arrival time of the latest update
(at the source) that has been completely transmitted (to the destination). AoI
quantifies the staleness of the update (information) at the destination. The
goal is to find a causal scheduling policy that minimizes the time average of
AoI, where the possible decisions at any time are i) whether to preempt the
update under transmission upon arrival of a new update, and ii) if no update is
under transmission, then choose which update to transmit (among the available
updates).
  In this paper, we propose a causal policy called SRPT$^+$ that at each time,
i) preempts the update under transmission if a new update arrives with a
smaller size, and ii) if no update is under transmission, then begins to
transmit the update for which the ratio of the reduction in AoI upon complete
transmission (if not preempted in future) and the remaining size, is maximum.
We characterize the performance of SRPT$^+$ using the metric called the
competitive ratio, i.e. the ratio of the average AoI of causal policy and the
average AoI of an optimal offline policy (that knows the entire input in
advance), maximized over all possible inputs. We show that the competitive
ratio of SRPT$^+$ is at most $4$. Further, we propose a simpler policy called
SRPT$^L$, that i) preempts the update under transmission if a new update
arrives with a smaller size, and ii) if no update is under transmission, then
begins to transmit the update with the latest arrival time. We show that the

and among their potential sources could be dark matter decay. Measurements of
the astrophysical flux using muon neutrinos are in slight tension with starting
event measurements. This tension is driven by an excess observed in the energy
range of 40-200 TeV with respect to the through-going expectation. Previous
works have considered the possibility that this excess may be due to heavy dark
matter decay and have placed constraints using gamma-ray and neutrino data.
However, these constraints are not without caveats since they rely on the
modeling of the astrophysical neutrino flux and the sources of gamma-ray

extragalactic constraints on decaying dark matter by considering Tibet
AS$_\gamma$ data, Fermi-LAT diffuse data, and the IceCube high-energy starting

such uncertainties amount to a variation of up to $\sim 55\%$ in the gamma-ray

can provide a powerful probe of the existence of ultralight bosons that are

superradiance, nonlinear effects from interactions with itself or other fields

evolutions to study black hole superradiance of a vector boson that attains a
mass, via a coupling to a complex scalar, through the Higgs mechanism. For the
cases considered, we find that the superradiant instability can lead to a
transient period where the scalar field reaches its symmetry restoration value,
leading to the formation of closed vortex strings, the temporary disruption of
the exponential growth of the cloud, and an explosive outburst of energy. After
the cloud loses sufficient mass, the superradiant growth resumes, and the cycle
repeats. Thus, the black hole will be spun down but, potentially, at a much
lower rate compared to when nonlinear effects are unimportant, and with the
liberated energy going primarily into bosonic radiation instead of

functions such as the NFW or Einasto models, but these approximations break
down in the transition region where halos become dominated by newly accreting
matter. Here we present a simple, accurate new fitting function that is
inspired by the asymptotic shapes of the separate orbiting and infalling halo
components. The orbiting term is described as a truncated Einasto profile,
$\rho_{\rm orb} \propto \exp \left[-2/\alpha\ (r / r_{\rm s})^\alpha - 1/\beta\

physically distinct scale and truncation radii, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which
control how rapidly the profiles steepen. The infalling profile is modelled as
a power law in overdensity that smoothly transitions to a constant at the halo
centre. We show that these formulae fit the averaged, total profiles in
simulations to about 5% accuracy across almost all of an expansive parameter
space in halo mass, redshift, cosmology, and accretion rate. When fixing
$\alpha = 0.18$ and $\beta = 3$, the formula becomes a three-parameter model
that fits individual halos better than the Einasto profile on average. By
analogy with King profiles, we show that the sharp truncation resembles a
cut-off in binding energy.

simplest possible seesaw mechanism for generating light Dirac neutrinos involve
heavy singlet Dirac fermions and a singlet scalar. In addition to unbroken
global lepton number, a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed to forbid direct
coupling between right and left chiral parts of light Dirac neutrino.
Generating light Dirac neutrino mass requires the singlet scalar to acquire a
vacuum expectation value (VEV) that also breaks the $Z_2$ symmetry, leading to
formation of domain walls in the early universe. These walls, if made unstable
by introducing a soft $Z_2$ breaking term, generate gravitational waves (GW)
with a spectrum characterized by the wall tension or the singlet VEV, and the
soft symmetry breaking scale. The scale of leptogenesis depends upon the
$Z_2$-breaking singlet VEV which is also responsible for the tension of the

variance cancellation. We forecast that a configuration corresponding to CMB-S4

$\sigma_{\tau_{\rm NL}} \approx 1.5$. These forecasts predict improvement
factors of 10 and 195 for $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ and $\sigma_{\tau_{\rm NL}}$,
respectively, over the sensitivity using VRO data alone, without internal

performed a morphological classification of these galaxy candidates finding
that the fraction of Ellipticals reaches more than the 60% in the central

We derive these abundances from an analysis of 404 absorption lines in
ultraviolet spectra collected using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on
the Hubble Space Telescope and previously analyzed optical spectra. A series of
appendices discusses the atomic data and quality of fits for these lines. The
r-process elements from Ba to Pb, including all elements at the third r-process
peak, exhibit remarkable agreement with the Solar r-process residuals, with a
standard deviation of the differences of only 0.08 dex (17%). In contrast,
deviations among the lighter elements from Ga to Te span nearly 1.4 dex, and
they show distinct trends from Ga to Se, Nb through Cd, and In through Te. The
r-process contribution to Ga, Ge, and As is small, and Se is the lightest
element whose production is dominated by the r-process. The lanthanide
fraction, log(X_La) = -1.39 +/- 0.09, is typical for r-process-enhanced stars
and higher than that of the kilonova from the GW170817 neutron-star merger
event. We advocate adopting this pattern as an alternative to the Solar
r-process-element residuals when confronting future theoretical models of
heavy-element nucleosynthesis with observations.

semileptonic $B\rightarrow X_c l \nu_l$ enable the determination of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ together with
non-perturbative matrix elements of the heavy quark expansion. In current fits,
only two distinct kinematic distributions are employed and, as a consequence,
higher moments of these distributions need to be taken into account to extract
the relevant non-perturbative matrix elements. The moments of a given
distribution are highly correlated and experimental uncertainties increase for
higher moments. To address these issues, Turczyk suggested the inclusion of the
charged lepton forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$ in global fits,
since it provides information on non-perturbative parameters beyond the
commonly used moments.
  It is possible to construct differences of partial moments of kinematic
distributions, which can provide additional information on the non-perturbative
parameters beyond $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$ and are studied in this work for the first
time. Further, experimental cuts on the four-momentum transfer square are
studied and are shown to preserve the shape of the angular distribution, in
contrast to commonly used cuts on the lepton energy. Finally, the impact of
final-state radiation and experimental lepton identification requirements on
measurements of $\mathcal{A}_{FB}$ and differences of partial moments are
discussed.

the Euler class, which characterizes the two-dimensional geometry of the

feature that cannot be captured by conventional topological classification
schemes. Starting from a carefully designed acoustic system, we retrieve a rich
phase diagram that includes the gapped Euler phase on top of non-Abelian
topological nodal phases. In particular we find that the gapped phase is
characterized by a meron (half-skyrmion) type topology in which the
cancellation of the orbital Zak phases by Zak phases of the bands contributes
in forming the characterizing winding number of the acoustic bands. Using
pump-probe techniques, we are able to extract the wave functions of the

direct observation of the meron geometry of these bands in the Brillouin zone,

separation in binary Fe-20 at.% Cr alloy is elucidated by intercepting the long
term (upto 1000 h at 773 K) aging at regular intervals and probing by a
combination of atom probe tomography (APT) and positron annihilation
spectroscopy (PAS). Since the Cr concentration of nano-scale {\alpha}/ phase in
Fe-20 at.% Cr alloy increases continually on aging, the point defects play
active role throughout the aging duration. The near-atomic resolution of APT
and self-seeking ability of positrons towards point defects make this analysis
possible. The difference of positron affinities between Fe and Cr enables
identification of the Cr-rich nano-phases that are specifically associated with
defects; they would otherwise be indiscernible in the absence of defect. Thus,
the temporal evolution of Cr-rich nano-phase along with the associated point
defects can be fully characterized at each stage of aging using APT and PAS,
respectively. The combined APT-PAS study shows that Cr-rich alpha-prime
precipitation is preceded by vacancy-Cr complexes that act as nucleation sites
for Cr clusters, which in turn, cause an early rise in micro-hardness due to
cluster hardening. Interestingly, this is accompanied by a significant rise in
point defect concentration. Our results depict that the vacancies present in
the core of the alpha-prime precipitates migrate towards the precipitates
interface during the course of aging and eventually get recovered resulting in
virtually defect-free precipitates. This study chronicles the way the point
defects shape the process of alpha-prime phase separation throughout the entire
length of aging.

difference to Dawson, our approach is centered at a natural homomorphism

the weighted homology of a quotient of chain complexes induced by $\theta$,

as a very competitive architecture alternative to convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) in computer vision. Despite increasingly stronger variants with
ever-higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model
size. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and
hierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into
recent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource
requirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop
light ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a
performance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied
direction we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for
the first time, enable attention-based vision models to compete with the best
light-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency.
This is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local
(LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of
self-attention and convolutions. For device-dedicated evaluation, rather than
relying on inaccurate proxies like the number of FLOPs or parameters, we adopt
a practical approach of focusing directly on on-device latency and, for the
first time, energy efficiency. Specifically, we show that our models are
Pareto-optimal when both accuracy-latency and accuracy-energy trade-offs are
considered, achieving strict dominance over other ViTs in almost all cases and
competing with the most efficient CNNs. Code is available at

production of dark matter (DM). In this scenario the momentum distribution of
the produced DM particles is usually taken to be the one obtained at reheating,
red-shifted at later times due to the expansion of the Universe. However, since
in such a scenario both the DM and the standard model (SM) fields couple to the
inflaton, the DM particles necessarily undergo self-scatterings, as well as
elastic and inelastic scattering reactions with the SM bath, all of which
proceed through $s-$channel or $t-$channel inflaton exchange. We compute the
momentum distribution of the DM particles including the effect of these
scatterings, and find that the distributions can be significantly altered, even
though DM remains non-thermal throughout the cosmological evolution. We observe
that if the inflaton dominantly couples to the SM Higgs boson through a
renormalizable interaction, then reheating temperatures and inflaton masses at
the TeV scale lead to a large effect from the scattering processes, with the
DM-inflaton coupling constrained by the DM density. The scattering effects are
found to be sensitive to the duration of the reheating process -- larger the
duration, more momentum modes are filled at reheating, leading to an enhanced
scattering probability. We also obtain the free-streaming length of such DM
using the resulting non-thermal momentum distribution, which can be used to
estimate the implications of the Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints on the DM mass. It
is observed that in the scenarios considered, including the scattering effects
can reduce the DM average velocity at matter-radiation equality, and its
free-streaming length, by upto a factor of $40$, thereby making the constraints
on light DM produced in inflaton decay significantly weaker.

termed DPT-I and DPT-II, based on a minimal set of symmetry assumptions. In the
special case of collective systems with infinite-range interactions, both are
triggered by excited-state quantum phase transitions. For quenches below the
critical energy, the existence of an additional conserved charge, identifying
the corresponding phase, allows for a nonzero value of the dynamical order
parameter characterizing DPTs-I, and precludes the main mechanism giving rise
to nonanalyticities in the return probability, trademark of DPTs-II. We propose
a statistical ensemble describing the long-time averages of order parameters in
DPTs-I, and provide a theoretical proof for the incompatibility of the main
mechanism for DPTs-II with the presence of this additional conserved charge.
Our results are numerically illustrated in the fully-connected transverse-field
Ising model, which exhibits both kinds of dynamical phase transitions. Finally,
we discuss the applicability of our theory to systems with finite-range
interactions, where the phenomenology of excited-state quantum phase
transitions is absent. We illustrate our findings by means of numerical

new Galactic GC, named Garro 02, situated at RA=18:05:51.1, Dec=-17:42:02 and
l=12.042 deg, b=+1.656 deg. Performing a PM-decontamination procedure, we built
a final catalogue with all cluster members, on which we performed a photometric
analysis. We calculated a reddening of $E(J-K_s)=1.07\pm 0.06$ mag and
extinction of $A_{Ks}=0.79\pm 0.04$ mag in the near-IR; while $E(BP-RP)=2.40\pm
0.01$ mag and $A_{G}=4.80\pm 0.02$ mag in optical passbands. Its heliocentric
distance is $D=5.6\pm 0.8$ kpc, which places Garro 02 at a Galactocentric
distance of $R_G=2.9$ kpc and Z=0.006 kpc above the Galactic plane. We
estimated the metallicity and age by comparison with known GCs and by fitting
PARSEC isochrones, finding [Fe/H]$=-1.30\pm 0.2$ dex and age=$12\pm 2$ Gyr. We
derived the mean cluster PM of $(\mu_{\alpha}^{\ast}, \mu_{\delta}) = (-6.07\pm
0.62, -6.15\pm 0.75)$ mas yr$^{-1}$. We calculated the cluster luminosity in
the near-IR of $M_{Ks}=-7.52\pm 1.23$ mag, which is equivalent to $M_{V}=-5.44$
mag. The core and tidal radii from the radial density profile are $r_c =1.25\pm
0.27$ arcmin (2.07 pc) and $r_t = 7.13\pm 3.83$ arcmin (11.82 pc),

our systematic study of VBM splitting ($\Delta$) in atomically thin MoS$_2$ and

the layer numbers. We found that VBM splitting in monolayer MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$
depends strongly on temperature, which contradicts the theory that spin-orbit

that the rate of change of VBM splitting with respect to temperature
($m=\frac{\partial\Delta}{\partial T}$) is the highest for monolayer (-0.14
meV/K for MoS$_2$) and the rate decreases as the layer number increases ($m ~
0$ meV/K for 5 layers MoS$_2$). We performed density functional theory (DFT)
and the GW with Bethe-Salpeter Equation (GW-BSE) calculations to determine the
electronic band structure and optical absorption for a bilayer MoS$_2$ with
different interlayer separations. Our simulations agree with the experimental
observations and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of VBM splitting
in atomically thin monolayer and multilayer TMDs originates from the changes in
the interlayer coupling strength between the neighboring layers. By studying
two different types of TMDs and many different layer thicknesses, we also
demonstrate that VBM splitting also depends on the layer numbers and type of

materials and develop next-generation devices based on spin-orbit interactions.

research for over 30 years. Digital line segments are particularly important as
other digital objects depend on their definition (e.g., digital convex objects
or digital star-shaped objects). It may be desirable for the digital line
segment systems to satisfy some nice properties that their Euclidean
counterparts also satisfy. The system is a consistent digital line segment
system (CDS) if it satisfies five properties, most notably the subsegment
property (the intersection of any two digital line segments should be
connected) and the prolongation property (any digital line segment should be
able to be extended into a digital line). It is known that any CDS must have
$\Omega(\log n)$ Hausdorff distance to their Euclidean counterparts, where $n$
is the number of grid points on a segment. In fact this lower bound even
applies to consistent digital rays (CDR) where for a fixed $p \in
\mathbb{Z}^2$, we consider the digital segments from $p$ to $q$ for each $q \in
\mathbb{Z}^2$. In this paper, we consider families of weak consistent digital
rays (WCDR) where we maintain four of the CDR properties but exclude the
prolongation property. In this paper, we give a WCDR construction that has
optimal Hausdorff distance to the exact constant. That is, we give a
construction whose Hausdorff distance is 1.5 under the $L_\infty$ metric, and
we show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, it is not possible to have a WCDR with
Hausdorff distance at most $1.5 - \epsilon$.

superconductor into a semiconducting nanowire with strong spin-orbit
interaction. We demonstrate such pairing using spin-selective quantum dots by
showing that breaking a Cooper pair can result in two electrons with equal spin
polarization. Our results demonstrate controllable detection of singlet and
triplet pairing in the proximitized nanowire. Achieving such triplet pairing in
a sequence of quantum dots will be required for realizing an artificial Kitaev

Additionally, during the image acquisition process, noise may get added to the
image. Such a noisy and blurred image can be represented as the image resulting
from the convolution of the original image with the associated point spread
function, along with additive noise. However, the blurred image often contains
inadequate information to uniquely determine the plausible original image.
Based on the availability of blurring information, image deblurring methods can
be classified as blind and non-blind. In non-blind image deblurring, some prior
information is known regarding the corresponding point spread function and the
added noise. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of
non-blind image deblurring methods with respect to the identification and
elimination of noise present in blurred images. In this study, three non-blind

were simulated, namely motion blurring and Gaussian blurring. The said three

deblurring of noisy blurred images and deblurring of images after denoising
through the application of the adaptive median filter. The obtained results
were then compared for each scenario to determine the best approach for

configurations.
  EVIMO2 consists of 41 minutes of data from three 640$\times$480 event
cameras, one 2080$\times$1552 classical color camera, inertial measurements
from two six axis inertial measurement units, and millimeter accurate object
poses from a Vicon motion capture system. The dataset's 173 sequences are
arranged into three categories. 3.75 minutes of independently moving household
objects, 22.55 minutes of static scenes, and 14.85 minutes of basic motions in
shallow scenes. Some sequences were recorded in low-light conditions where
conventional cameras fail. Depth and segmentation are provided at 60 Hz for the
event cameras and 30 Hz for the classical camera. The masks can be regenerated
using open-source code up to rates as high as 200 Hz.

a new composition experiment, and leverage these new constructs to obtain
significant privacy budget savings and improved privacy-utility tradeoffs under

used to save privacy budget in more general contexts: when a differentially

is reached, and when the output of a DP mechanism provides unsatisfactory
utility. Examples of the former include iterative optimization algorithms,
whereas examples of the latter include training a machine learning model with a
large generalization error. Our techniques can be applied beyond the current

One way to increase material storage capacity would be to write several bits at
a time in the bulk of the material. However, the manipulation of bits is
commonly done through quasi-static operations. While simple to model, this
method is known to reduce memory capacity. In this paper, we demonstrate how a
reinforcement learning agent can exploit the dynamical response of a simple
multi-bit mechanical system to restore its memory to full capacity. To do so,
we introduce a model framework consisting of a chain of bi-stable springs,
which is manipulated on one end by the external action of the agent. We show
that the agent manages to learn how to reach all available states for three
springs, even though some states are not reachable through adiabatic
manipulation, and that both the training speed and convergence within physical
parameter space are improved using transfer learning techniques. Interestingly,
the agent also points to an optimal design of the system in terms of writing
time. In fact, it appears to learn how to take advantage of the underlying
physics: the control time exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the internal
dissipation, reaching a minimum at a cross-over shown to verify a mechanically
motivated scaling relation.

real coefficients and it is a continuous function of the curve coordinates. As
the endpoints of the curves tend to coincide, the Jones polynomial tends to

more than just team efficiency -- humans also have biases and expectations for
team dynamics. Our hypothesis is that the way inclusive robots divide the task
(i.e., how the robots split a larger task into subtask allocations) should be
both legible and fair to the human partner. In this paper we introduce a
bilevel optimization approach that enables robot teams to identify high-level
subtask allocations and low-level trajectories that optimize for legibility,
fairness, or a combination of both objectives. We then test our resulting
algorithm across studies where humans watch or play with robot teams. We find
that our approach to generating legible teams makes the human's role clear, and
that humans typically prefer to join and collaborate with legible teams instead
of teams that only optimize for efficiency. Incorporating fairness alongside
legibility further encourages participation: when humans play with robots, we
find that they prefer (potentially inefficient) teams where the subtasks or

simulated millisecond pulsars in a realistic dynamical environment: (i) pulsars
were born from the known stellar mass components of our Galaxy; (ii) pulsars
were given natal velocity kicks as empirically observed from two different
studies (or, for comparison, without kicks); (iii) pulsars were evolved in a
Galactic gravitational potential consistent with observations. Multiple

gamma-ray surface brightness profiles. From comparisons with published
Fermi-LAT surface brightness profiles, our pulsar simulations cannot reproduce
the concentrated emission in the central degrees of the Bulge, though models
without natal velocity kicks approach the data. We considered additive
combinations of our (primordial MSP) simulations with models where pulsars are
deposited from destroyed globular clusters in the Bulge, and a simple model for
pulsars produced in the nuclear star cluster. We can reasonably reproduce the

eruptive flare, observed off the solar limb by SDO/AIA, that lacked a
detectable white-light coronal mass ejection. The erupting flux rope underwent
kinking, rotation, and apparent leg-leg interaction during the event. The
oscillations were observed simultaneously in multiple AIA channels at 304, 171,
and 193 {\AA}, indicating that multithermal plasma was entrained in the rope.
After reaching the overlying loops in the active region, the flux rope
exhibited large-amplitude, decaying kink oscillations with an apparent initial
amplitude of 30 Mm, period of about 16 min, and decay time of about 17 min. We
interpret these oscillations as a fundamental standing kink mode of the flux
rope. The oscillation polarization has a clear vertical component, while the
departure of the detected waveform from a sinusoidal signal suggests that the
oscillation could be circularly or elliptically polarized. The estimated kink
speed is 1080 km/s, corresponding to an Alfv\'en speed of about 760 km/s. This
speed, together with the estimated electron density in the rope from our DEM
analysis, $n_e \approx$(1.5--2.0)$\times 10^9$cm$^{-3}$, yields a magnetic
field strength of about 15 G. To the best of our knowledge, decaying kink
oscillations of a flux rope with non-horizontal polarization during a confined
eruptive flare have not been reported before. These oscillations provide unique
opportunities for indirect measurements of the magnetic-field strength in
low-coronal flux ropes during failed eruptions.

the angular resolution of the finite difference stencil. This, in turn, allows
for significant improvements in both stencil width and formal truncation error.
The resulting schemes can achieve a formal accuracy that is arbitrarily close
to $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, which is the optimal consistency order for monotone
approximations of second order operators. We present three different

the trapezoid rule on uniform angular discretizations to allow for computation
on a nearest-neighbors finite difference stencil over a large range of grid

convergence while simultaneously utilizing narrower stencils than other

available for hundreds of low- and intermediate-mass stars in evolved phases.
Current physical processes tested in stellar evolution models cannot reproduce
the evolution of these core rotation rates. We investigate the efficiency of
the internal angular momentum redistribution in red giants during the hydrogen
shell and core-helium burning phases based on the asteroseismic determinations
of their core rotation rates. We compute stellar evolution models with rotation
and model the transport of angular momentum by the action of a sole dominant
diffusive process parametrized by an additional viscosity. We constrain the
values of this viscosity to match the mean core rotation rates of red giants
and their behaviour with mass and evolution along the red giant branch and in
the red clump. For red giants in the hydrogen shell-burning phase the transport
of angular momentum must be more efficient in more massive stars. The
additional viscosity is found to vary by approximately two orders of magnitude
in the mass range M $\sim$ 1 - 2.5 M$_{\odot}$. As stars evolve along the red
giant branch, the efficiency of the internal transport of angular momentum must
increase for low-mass stars (M $\lesssim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) and remain
approximately constant for slightly higher masses (2.0 M$_{\odot}$ $\lesssim$ M
$\lesssim$ 2.5 M$_{\odot}$). In red-clump stars, the additional viscosities
must be an order of magnitude higher than in younger red giants of similar mass
during the hydrogen shell-burning phase. In combination with previous efforts,
we obtain a clear picture of how the physical processes acting in stellar
interiors should redistribute angular momentum from the end of the main
sequence until the core-helium burning phase for low- and intermediate-mass
stars to satisfy the asteroseismic constraints.

a threshold is applied on a similarity score to detect OoD inputs. One such
similarity is angular similarity which is the dot product of latent

uncertainty, for example, if the angular similarity is less, it is less certain
that the input belongs to that class. However, we observe that, different
classes have different distributions of angular similarity. Therefore, applying
a single threshold for all classes is not ideal since the same similarity score
represents different uncertainties for different classes. In this paper, we
propose norm-scaling which normalizes the logits separately for each class.
This ensures that a single value consistently represents similar uncertainty
for various classes. We show that norm-scaling, when used with maximum softmax

and L samples. Chromatographic drift is common along both the first-dimension
(modulations), and along the second-dimension (mass spectral acquisitions),
while drift along the mass channel and sample dimensions is for all practical
purposes nonexistent. A number of solutions to handling GC$\times$GC-TOFMS data
have been proposed: these involve reshaping the data to make it amenable to
either 2nd order decomposition techniques based on Multivariate Curve
Resolution (MCR), or 3rd order decomposition techniques such as Parallel Factor
Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). PARAFAC2 has been utilised to model chromatographic
drift along one mode, which has enabled its use for robust decomposition of
multiple GC-MS experiments. Although extensible, it is not straightforward to
implement a PARAFAC2 model that accounts for drift along multiple modes. In
this submission, we demonstrate a new approach and a general theory for
modelling data with drift along multiple modes, for applications in
multidimensional chromatography with multivariate detection.

forms to their physiological functions: the first is based on quantifying their
consistency with the underlying mean behavior, and the second assesses
""orderliness"" of the waves' features. The corresponding measures capture the
wave's characteristic and abnormal behaviors, such as atypical periodicity or
excessive clustering, and demonstrate coupling between the patterns' dynamics
and the animal's location, speed and acceleration. Specifically, we studied
patterns of $\theta$ and $\gamma$ waves, and Sharp Wave Ripples, and observed
speed-modulated changes of the wave's cadence, an antiphase relationship
between orderliness and acceleration, as well as spatial selectiveness of
patterns. Furthermore, we found an interdependence between orderliness and
regularity: larger deviations from steady oscillatory behavior tend to
accompany disarrayed temporal cluttering of peaks and troughs. Taken together,
our results offer a complementary -- mesoscale -- perspective on brain wave

applications, with uses ranging from linear system solvers in finite element
methods to optimization solvers in model predictive control. Recently, a new
computational strategy for iterative methods called ARCHITECT was proposed by
Li et al. in [1] that uses the redundant number representation to create
""stable digits"" in the Most-significant Digits (MSDs) of an iterate, allowing
the future iterations to assume the stable MSDs have not changed their value,
eliminating the need to recompute them. In this work, we present a theoretical
analysis of how these ""stable digits"" arise in iterative methods by showing
that a Fejer monotone sequence in the redundant number representation can
develop stable MSDs in the elements of the sequence as the sequence grows in
length. This property of Fejer monotone sequences allows us to expand the class
of iterative methods known to have MSD stability when using the redundant
number representation to include any fixed-point iteration of a contractive
Lipschitz continuous function. We then show that this allows for the
theoretical guarantee of digit stability not just in the Jacobi method that was
previously analyzed by Li et al. in [2], but also in other commonly used
methods such as Newton's method.

accurate but inefficient physics-based models, and efficient but sometimes
inaccurate equivalent circuit and black-box models. To realize accuracy and
efficiency simultaneously in battery modeling, we propose to build a
data-driven surrogate for a battery system while incorporating the underlying
physics as constraints. In this work, we innovatively treat the functional
mapping from current curve to terminal voltage as a composite of operators,
which is approximated by the powerful deep operator network (DeepONet). Its
learning capability is firstly verified through a predictive test for Li-ion
concentration at two electrodes. In this experiment, the physics-informed
DeepONet is found to be more robust than the purely data-driven DeepONet,
especially in temporal extrapolation scenarios. A composite surrogate is then
constructed for mapping current curve and solid diffusivity to terminal voltage
with three operator networks, in which two parallel physics-informed DeepONets
are firstly used to predict Li-ion concentration at two electrodes, and then
based on their surface values, a DeepONet is built to give terminal voltage
predictions. Since the surrogate is differentiable anywhere, it is endowed with
the ability to learn from data directly, which was validated by using terminal
voltage measurements to estimate input parameters. The proposed surrogate built
upon operator networks possesses great potential to be applied in on-board
scenarios, such as battery management system, since it integrates efficiency
and accuracy by incorporating underlying physics, and also leaves an interface
for model refinement through a totally differentiable model structure.

additional heating process. However, the origin of the ELP remains rather
unclear. Here we present the analysis of a C1.4 flare that features such an

  Super-Resolution",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to the sophisticated imaging process, an identical scene captured by
different cameras could exhibit distinct imaging patterns, introducing distinct
proficiency among the super-resolution (SR) models trained on images from
different devices. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task
coded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on
the paired images captured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured
by arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the
absence of paired data from various imaging devices. To address this issue, we
propose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-world SR, named
Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target
domain with available real paired data from a source camera. DADA employs the
Domain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model
training even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA
facilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for
two LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial
Adaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image. InterAA and IntraAA
together improve the model transferability from the source domain to the
target. We empirically conduct experiments under six Real to Real adaptation
settings among three different cameras, and achieve superior performance
compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also evaluate the
proposed DADA to address the adaptation to the video camera, which presents a
promising research topic to promote the wide applications of real-world
super-resolution. Our source code is publicly available at

problems of insufficient datasets and long time-consuming labeling. In this
paper, we introduce the self-supervised method MAE(Masked Autoencoders) into
knee joint images to provide a good initial weight for the segmentation model
and improve the adaptability of the model to small datasets. Secondly, we
propose a weakly supervised paradigm for meniscus segmentation based on the
combination of point and line to reduce the time of labeling. Based on the weak
label ,we design a region growing algorithm to generate pseudo-label. Finally
we train the segmentation network based on pseudo-labels with weight transfer
from self-supervision. Sufficient experimental results show that our proposed
method combining self-supervision and weak supervision can almost approach the
performance of purely fully supervised models while greatly reducing the
required labeling time and dataset size.

qubits. Contemporary high-coherence superconducting qubits are formed by
material systems mostly consisting of superconducting films on substrate with
low dielectric loss, where the loss mainly originates from the surfaces and
interfaces. Among the multiple candidates for material systems, a combination
of titanium nitride (TiN) film and sapphire substrate has good potential
because of its chemical stability against oxidization, and high quality at
interfaces. In this work, we report a TiN film deposited onto sapphire
substrate achieving low dielectric loss at the material interface. Through the
systematic characterizations of a series of transmon qubits fabricated with
identical batches of TiN base layers, but different geometries of qubit
shunting capacitors with various participation ratios of the material
interface, we quantitatively extract the loss tangent value at the
substrate-metal interface smaller than $8.9 \times 10^{-4}$ in 1-nm disordered
layer. By optimizing the interface participation ratio of the transmon qubit,
we reproducibly achieve qubit lifetimes of up to 300 $\mu$s and quality factors
approaching 8 million. We demonstrate that TiN film on sapphire substrate is an
ideal material system for high-coherence superconducting qubits. Our analyses
further suggest that the interface dielectric loss around the Josephson
junction part of the circuit could be the dominant limitation of lifetimes for
state-of-the-art transmon qubits.

Practically every vehicle uses the universal Controller Area Network (CAN) bus

array gain loss, so existing works mainly focus on compensating for this loss
by utilizing the time delay (TD) beamformer. By contrast, this paper
demonstrates that although the near-field beam split effect degrades the array
gain, it also provides a new possibility to realize fast near-field beam
training. Specifically, we first reveal the mechanism of the near-field
controllable beam split effect. This effect indicates that, by dedicatedly
designing the delay parameters, a TD beamformer is able to control the degree
of the near-field beam split effect, i.e., beams at different frequencies can
flexibly occupy the desired location range. Due to the similarity with the
dispersion of natural light caused by a prism, this effect is also termed as
the near-field rainbow in this paper. Then, taking advantage of the near-field
rainbow effect, a fast wideband beam training scheme is proposed. In our
scheme, the close form of the beamforming vector is elaborately derived to
enable beams at different frequencies to be focused on different desired
locations. By this means, the optimal beamforming vector with the largest array
gain can be rapidly searched out by generating multiple beams focused on
multiple locations simultaneously through only one radio-frequency (RF) chain.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme is able to realize
near-optimal nearfield beam training with a very low training overhead.

many graph-based tasks such as node classification and graph classification.
However, many recent works have demonstrated that an attacker can mislead GNN
models by slightly perturbing the graph structure. Existing attacks to GNNs are
either under the less practical threat model where the attacker is assumed to
access the GNN model parameters, or under the practical black-box threat model
but consider perturbing node features that are shown to be not enough
effective. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and consider black-box
attacks to GNNs with structure perturbation as well as with theoretical
guarantees. We propose to address this challenge through bandit techniques.
Specifically, we formulate our attack as an online optimization with bandit
feedback. This original problem is essentially NP-hard due to the fact that
perturbing the graph structure is a binary optimization problem. We then
propose an online attack based on bandit optimization which is proven to be
{sublinear} to the query number $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}T^{3/4})$ where
$N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we evaluate our proposed
attack by conducting experiments over multiple datasets and GNN models. The
experimental results on various citation graphs and image graphs show that our
attack is both effective and efficient. Source code is available

5-minute intervals. Two deep neural networks were used to detect and count the
growing colonies and identify their species. When blindly tested with 265

of the risk factors is dominant, as often observed in competing risks

incineration plants are often weakly observable, where little information about
the environmental state is contained in the observations due to technical
difficulty or maintenance cost (e.g., no sensors for observing the state of the
garbage to be handled). Based on the findings that skilled operators in such
environments choose predetermined control strategies (e.g., grasping and

algorithm: Gaussian process self-triggered policy search (GPSTPS). GPSTPS has
two types of control policies: action and duration. A gating mechanism either
maintains the action selected by the action policy for the duration specified
by the duration policy or updates the action and duration by passing new
observations to the policy; therefore, it is categorized as self-triggered.
GPSTPS simultaneously learns both policies by trial and error based on sparse
GP priors and variational learning to maximize the return. To verify the
performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on

a simulation and a robotic waste crane system. As experimental results, the
proposed method acquired suitable policies to determine the action and duration

(DPENet) to achieve effective deraining with structure-accurate rain-free

former aims to achieve accurate rain removal, and the latter is designed to
recover the details of rain-free images. We introduce two main strategies
within our networks to achieve trade-off between the effectiveness of deraining
and the detail restoration of rain-free images. Firstly, a dilated dense
residual block (DDRB) within the rain streaks removal network is presented to
aggregate high/low level features of heavy rain. Secondly, an enhanced residual
pixel-wise attention block (ERPAB) within the detail reconstruction network is
designed for context information aggregation. We also propose a comprehensive

  Alignment: Learning Invariance and Variance","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.11797",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation on time-series data is often encountered in the industry
but received limited attention in academia. Most of the existing domain
adaptation methods for time-series data borrow the ideas from the existing
methods for non-time series data to extract the domain-invariant
representation. However, two peculiar difficulties to time-series data have not
been solved. 1) It is not a trivial task to model the domain-invariant and
complex dependence among different timestamps. 2) The domain-variant
information is important but how to leverage them is almost underexploited.
Fortunately, the stableness of causal structures among different domains
inspires us to explore the structures behind the time-series data. Based on
this inspiration, we investigate the domain-invariant unweighted sparse
associative structures and the domain-variant strengths of the structures. To
achieve this, we propose Sparse Associative structure alignment by learning
Invariance and Variance (SASA-IV in short), a model that simultaneously aligns
the invariant unweighted spare associative structures and considers the variant
information for time-series unsupervised domain adaptation. Technologically, we
extract the domain-invariant unweighted sparse associative structures with a
unidirectional alignment restriction and embed the domain-variant strengths via
a well-designed autoregressive module. Experimental results not only testify
that our model yields state-of-the-art performance on three real-world datasets

relax the setting by allowing all cameras to both move along the boundary lines

to much higher computational complexity to identify the optimal action. To this
end, we propose to leverage the action selection from multi-agent reinforcement

  Language Processing",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beamforming is a powerful tool designed to enhance speech signals from the
direction of a target source. Computing the beamforming filter requires
estimating spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of the source and noise signals.
Time-frequency masks are often used to compute these SCMs. Most studies of
mask-based beamforming have assumed that the sources do not move. However,
sources often move in practice, which causes performance degradation. In this
paper, we address the problem of mask-based beamforming for moving sources. We
first review classical approaches to tracking a moving source, which perform
online or blockwise computation of the SCMs. We show that these approaches can
be interpreted as computing a sum of instantaneous SCMs weighted by attention
weights. These weights indicate which time frames of the signal to consider in
the SCM computation. Online or blockwise computation assumes a heuristic and
deterministic way of computing these attention weights that, although simple,
may not result in optimal performance. We thus introduce a learning-based
framework that computes optimal attention weights for beamforming. We achieve
this using a neural network implemented with self-attention layers. We show
experimentally that our proposed framework can greatly improve beamforming
performance in moving source situations while maintaining high performance in
non-moving situations, thus enabling the development of mask-based beamformers
robust to source movements.

since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,

coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB

novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

can be leveraged to improve the performances of existing models. We address
both the deterministic context with the proposed DILATE loss function and the

incomplete physical models with deep data-driven networks for accurate

disentangles physical dynamics from residual information necessary for

(APHYNITY) that ensures a principled and unique linear decomposition between
physical and data-driven components under mild assumptions, leading to better

challenge when facing the large amount of data from different instruments. For
the automatic detection of ICMEs we propose a pipeline using a method that has
recently proven successful in medical image segmentation. Comparing it to an

outperforms the baseline regarding training time by a factor of approximately
20, thus making it more applicable for other datasets. The method has been
tested on in situ data from the Wind spacecraft between 1997 and 2015 with a

Additionally, it produced reasonable results on datasets with fewer features

challenging to build a robust model for Chinese LPs since there are not enough
large and representative datasets. In this work, we propose a new dataset named
Chinese Road Plate Dataset (CRPD) that contains multi-objective Chinese LP
images as a supplement to the existing public benchmarks. The images are mainly
captured with electronic monitoring systems with detailed annotations. To our
knowledge, CRPD is the largest public multi-objective Chinese LP dataset with
annotations of vertices. With CRPD, a unified detection and recognition network
with high efficiency is presented as the baseline. The network is end-to-end
trainable with totally real-time inference efficiency (30 fps with 640p). The
experiments on several public benchmarks demonstrate that our method has
reached competitive performance. The code and dataset will be publicly

help ease this problem, we give a theoretical analysis on this tradeoff and
further calculate adaptive weights for the two types of quality scores. We also
propose two deep-learning-based regressors to model the no-reference and

propose a unified SPQE metric for SR-IQA. Experimental results demonstrate that

has become a promising way to speed-up program execution. In order to stay up
with time, various performance-oriented programming languages provide a
multitude of constructs to allow programmers to write parallelizable loops.
Correspondingly, researchers have developed techniques to automatically
parallelize loops that do not carry dependences across iterations, and/or call
pure functions. However, in managed languages with platform-independent
runtimes such as Java, it is practically infeasible to perform complex
dependence analysis during JIT compilation. In this paper, we propose
AutoTornado, a first of its kind static+JIT loop parallelizer for Java programs
that parallelizes loops for heterogeneous architectures using TornadoVM (a
Graal-based VM that supports insertion of @Parallel constructs for loop
parallelization).
  AutoTornado performs sophisticated dependence and purity analysis of Java
programs statically, in the Soot framework, to generate constraints encoding
conditions under which a given loop can be parallelized. The generated
constraints are then fed to the Z3 theorem prover (which we have integrated
with Soot) to annotate canonical for loops that can be parallelized using the
@Parallel construct. We have also added runtime support in TornadoVM to use
static analysis results for loop parallelization. Our evaluation over several
standard parallelization kernels shows that AutoTornado correctly parallelizes
61.3% of manually parallelizable loops, with an efficient static analysis and a
near-zero runtime overhead. To the best of our knowledge, AutoTornado is not
only the first tool that performs program-analysis based parallelization for a
real-world JVM, but also the first to integrate Z3 with Soot for loop
parallelization.

I-WP, Primitive, and Gyroid are created with identical porosity, and three
different types of porous media are further generated for each porous geometry
to investigate the relationship of shape-tortuosity, microporosity, and pore
size on permeability and inertial drag factors. A pore-scale direct numerical
simulation approach is performed for the first two types of porous media by
solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The specific microporosity is
quantitatively induced in the solid region where Darcy-Forchheimer-Brinkman

are described in the coexistence phase of chiral spin-singlet superconductivity
and noncollinear spin ordering on a triangular lattice in the presence of few
(up to four) vortices. We consider the topological phase transition induced by
the magnetic order between the phase hosting Majorana modes and the initial
phase of the chiral d-wave superconductivity supporting non-Majorana modes
which is also topologically nontrivial. The change of the excitation spectrum
at the critical point is obtained in both cases of open and periodic boundary
conditions in the presence of vortices. It is proved that zero energy Majorana
modes localized at vortex cores are caused by noncollinear long-range magnetic
ordering. Even though nearby excitation energies of subgap states including the
edge-localized and vortex-localized states are very close to each other, the
energy difference between different vortex bound states is an order of
magnitude higher. This difference determines the energy gap for Majorana vortex
modes separating them from other vortex bound states. It is found that even in
the presence of noncollinear spin ordering its value can be estimated from the
excitation energy of vortex bound states in the pure chiral d-wave state for
the nonmagnetic case. By studying local density of states near the vortex cores
the possibility to experimentally detect the described Majorana vortex modes by
scanning tunneling microscopy is discussed. It is demonstrated that Majorana
vortex modes and Majorana antivortex modes induced by noncollinear magnetism
have different features in energy and spatially resolved density of states due
to the chiral symmetry on the superconducting order parameter.

BGK-Boltzmann equation. Gauss-Hermite quadratures with different degree of
precision are used to solve the kinetic equation, so that the continuum
(solution truncated at the Navier-Stokes order) and non-continuum (rarefied gas
dynamics) solutions can be compared. When the kinetic equation is solved with
adequate accuracy, prominent variations of the vertical velocity (the collision
is in the horizontal direction), the viscous stress components, and droplet
morphology are observed during the formation of liquid bridge, which
demonstrates the importance of the rarefaction effects and the failure of the
Navier-Stokes equation. The rarefaction effects change the topology of
streamlines near the droplet surface, suppress the high-magnitude vorticity
concentration inside the interdroplet region, and promote the vorticity
diffusion around outer droplet surface. Two physical mechanisms responsible for
the local energy conversion between the free and kinetic energies are
identified, namely, the total pressure-dilatation coupling effect and the
interaction between the density gradient and strain rate tensor. An energy
conversion analysis is performed to show that the rarefaction effects can
enhance the conversion from free energy to kinetic energy and facilitate the
discharge of interdroplet gas film along the vertical direction, thereby
boosting droplet coalescence.

investigate the impact of the propeller and the elevator on the flight
performance. Four trim strategies with different objectives are proposed and
then compared to find the optimal control allocation. A heuristic descent
search method is applied to search the optimal velocity at which the propeller
and the elevator are engaged. A significant improvement of power required at
medium and high speed with acceptable rotor airloads increment was found by
using the Hybrid Trim strategy in the speed range of 0-100m/s, with regard to a
pre-configured pitch angle schedule. The corresponding control variables
obtained locate in a reasonable control range, with a maximum power reduced of
13% at 100m/s, which showcases the potential of the Hybrid Trim strategy.

neutrinos measured at Earth due to neutrino oscillations. On top of this, the
$\nu_\tau$ offers a unique channel for neutrino astronomy due to absence of an
atmospheric $\nu_\tau$ background contribution. When a $\nu_\tau$ interacts it
produces a particle cascade and often a $\tau$ lepton which in turn decays
mainly into another cascade. This results in a double cascade signature. An
excellent angular resolution can be achieved when both cascade vertices are

extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) in 6G networks with ultra-high spectral

mixed LoS/NLoS near-field XL-MIMO channel model is proposed to match the
practical near-field XL-MIMO scenario, where the LoS path component is modeled
by the geometric free space propagation assumption while NLoS path components
are modeled by the near-field array response vectors. Then, to define the range

In the
bin packing problem, we are given n items with sizes in (0,1] and the goal is
to pack them into the minimum number of unit-sized bins. First, we study bin
packing under the i.i.d. model, where item sizes are sampled independently and
identically from a distribution in (0,1]. Both the distribution and the total
number of items are unknown. The items arrive one by one and their sizes are
revealed upon their arrival and they must be packed immediately and irrevocably
in bins of size 1. We provide a simple meta-algorithm that takes an offline
$\alpha$-asymptotic approximation algorithm and provides a polynomial-time
$(\alpha + \varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under the
i.i.d. model, where $\varepsilon$>0 is a small constant. Using the AFPTAS for
offline bin packing, we thus provide a linear time
$(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under i.i.d.
model, thus settling the problem.
  We then study the random-order model, where an adversary specifies the items,
but the order of arrival of items is drawn uniformly at random from the set of
all permutations of the items. Kenyon's seminal result [SODA'96] showed that
the Best-Fit algorithm has a competitive ratio of at most 3/2 in the
random-order model, and conjectured the ratio to be around 1.15. However, it
has been a long-standing open problem to break the barrier of 3/2 even for
special cases. Recently, Albers et al. [Algorithmica'21] showed an improvement
to 5/4 competitive ratio in the special case when all the item sizes are
greater than 1/3. For this special case, we settle the analysis by showing that
Best-Fit has a competitive ratio of 1. We make further progress by breaking the
barrier of 3/2 for the 3-Partition problem, a notoriously hard special case of
bin packing, where all item sizes lie in (1/4,1/2].

vehicle (UAV) tracking due to its high frame rates, robustness and low
calculation resources. However, it is fragile because of two inherent defects,
i.e, boundary effect and filter corruption. Some methods by enlarging the
search area can mitigate the boundary effect, yet introducing the undesired
background distractors. Another approaches can alleviate the temporal
degeneration of learned filters by introducing the temporal regularizer, which
depends on the assumption that the filers between consecutive frames should be
coherent. In fact, sometimes the filers at the ($t-1$)th frame is vulnerable to
heavy occlusion from backgrounds, which causes that the assumption does not
hold. To handle them, in this work, we propose a novel $\ell_{1}$
regularization correlation filter with adaptive contextual learning and
keyfilter selection for UAV tracking. Firstly, we adaptively detect the
positions of effective contextual distractors by the aid of the distribution of
local maximum values on the response map of current frame which is generated by
using the previous correlation filter model. Next, we eliminate inconsistent
labels for the tracked target by removing one on each distractor and develop a
new score scheme for each distractor. Then, we can select the keyfilter from
the filters pool by finding the maximal similarity between the target at the
current frame and the target template corresponding to each filter in the
filters pool. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments on three
authoritative UAV datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the
state-of-the-art tracking methods based on correlation filter framework.

classification mechanism of existing deep learning models seems to contrast to
humans' recognition mechanism. With only a glance at an image of the object
even unknown type, humans can quickly and precisely find other same category
objects from massive images, which benefits from daily recognition of various
objects. In this paper, we attempt to build a generalizable framework that
emulates the humans' recognition mechanism in the image classification task,
hoping to improve the classification performance on unseen categories with the
support of annotations of other categories. Specifically, we investigate a new
task termed Comparison Knowledge Translation (CKT). Given a set of fully
labeled categories, CKT aims to translate the comparison knowledge learned from
the labeled categories to a set of novel categories. To this end, we put
forward a Comparison Classification Translation Network (CCT-Net), which
comprises a comparison classifier and a matching discriminator. The comparison
classifier is devised to classify whether two images belong to the same
category or not, while the matching discriminator works together in an
adversarial manner to ensure whether classified results match the truth.
Exhaustive experiments show that CCT-Net achieves surprising generalization

Further, we investigate splitting the 2D time and frequency estimation problem
in wideband systems into cascaded 1D estimations with the help of the GMM. The
proposed cascaded GMM approach drastically reduces the complexity and memory
requirements. We observe that due to the training on realistic channel data,
the proposed GMM estimators seem to inherently perform a trade-off between
saving complexity/parameters and estimation performance. We compare these
low-complexity approaches to a practical and low cost method that relies on the

the tasks on which these artificial networks are typically trained and
evaluated tend to be highly specialized and do not generalize well, e.g.,
accuracy drops after image rotation. In this respect, biological visual systems
are more flexible and efficient than artificial systems for more general tasks,
such as recognizing an animal. To further the comparison between biological and
artificial neural networks, we re-trained the standard VGG 16 CNN on two
independent tasks that are ecologically relevant to humans: detecting the
presence of an animal or an artifact. We show that re-training the network
achieves a human-like level of performance, comparable to that reported in
psychophysical tasks. In addition, we show that the categorization is better
when the outputs of the models are combined. Indeed, animals (e.g., lions) tend
to be less present in photographs that contain artifacts (e.g., buildings).
Furthermore, these re-trained models were able to reproduce some unexpected
behavioral observations from human psychophysics, such as robustness to
rotation (e.g., an upside-down or tilted image) or to a grayscale

Situations where no such law exists can sometimes be handled by weakening the
notion of distributive law, still recovering a composite monad. A celebrated
result from Eugenia Cheng shows that combining $n$ monads is possible by
iterating more distributive laws, provided they satisfy a coherence condition
called the Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, the order of composition does not
matter, leading to a form of associativity. The main contribution of this paper
is to generalise the associativity of iterated composition to weak distributive
laws in the case of $n = 3$ monads. To this end, we use string-diagrammatic

closed around a spatial torus as a function of its length as well as the
spectrum of glueballs. The extraction of the spectra has been realized by
simulating four dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories and performing measurements
using lattice techniques. Regarding flux-tubes, we have performed calculations
for $N=3,5,6$ and for various values of spin, parity and longitudinal momentum.
Long flux-tubes can be thought of as infinitesimally thin strings; hence their
spectrum is expected to be described by an effective string theory.
Furthermore, the flux-tube's internal structure makes possible the existence of
massive states in addition to string modes. Our calculations demonstrate that
although most states exhibit a spectrum which can be approximated adequately by
Nambu-Goto there is strong evidence for the existence of a massive axion on the
world-sheet of the QCD flux-tube as well as a bound state of two such axions.
Regarding glueballs, we extracted spectra from $N=2$ to $N=12$ which enables us
to extrapolate to $N= \infty$. Our main aim was to calculate the lightest
glueball masses for all different configurations of the quantum numbers of
spin, parity and charge conjugation. This provides a major update on the
spectrum of glueballs in the planar limit.

images is expertise-demanded and time-consuming; hence semi-supervised learning
(SSL), particularly barely-supervised learning, is highly desirable for
training with insufficient labeled data. We observed that the class imbalance
problem is severe in the knee MR images as the cartilages only occupy 6% of
foreground volumes, and the situation becomes worse without sufficient labeled
data. To address the above problem, we present a novel framework for
barely-supervised knee segmentation with noisy and imbalanced labels. Our
framework leverages label distribution to encourage the network to put more
effort into learning cartilage parts. Specifically, we utilize 1.) label
quantity distribution for modifying the objective loss function to a
class-aware weighted form and 2.) label position distribution for constructing
a cropping probability mask to crop more sub-volumes in cartilage areas from
both labeled and unlabeled inputs. In addition, we design dual
uncertainty-aware sampling supervision to enhance the supervision of
low-confident categories for efficient unsupervised learning. Experiments show
that our proposed framework brings significant improvements by incorporating
the unlabeled data and alleviating the problem of class imbalance. More
importantly, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods,
demonstrating the potential of our framework for the more challenging SSL

studied for decades. Although manual picking can produce accurate normal
moveout (NMO) velocities from the velocity spectra of prestack gathers, it is
time-consuming and becomes infeasible with the emergence of large amount of
seismic data. Numerous automatic velocity picking methods have thus been
developed. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have produced good
results on the seismic data with medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
Unfortunately, it still lacks a picking method to automatically generate

multi-information fusion network (MIFN) to estimate stacking velocity from the
fusion information of velocity spectra and stack gather segments (SGS). In
particular, we transform the velocity picking problem into a semantic

(LAL) for skeleton-level to pixel-level adjustable vessel segmentation. LAL
mainly consists of two designs: a label adversarial loss and an embeddable

relationship between the two label supervisions, while the adjustment layer
adjusts the network parameters to match the different adversarial weights. Such
a design can efficiently capture the variation between the two supervisions,
making the segmentation continuous and tunable. This continuous process allows
us to recommend high-quality vessel segmentation with clear caliber and

neural networks have been widely used in the classification of cardiac
arrhythmias. However, the existing neural network applied to ECG signal
detection usually requires a lot of computing resources, which is not friendlyF
to resource-constrained equipment, and it is difficult to realize real-time
monitoring. In this paper, a binarized convolutional neural network suitable
for ECG monitoring is proposed, which is hardware-friendly and more suitable
for use in resource-constrained wearable devices. Targeting the MIT-BIH
arrhythmia database, the classifier based on this network reached an accuracy
of 95.67% in the five-class test. Compared with the proposed baseline
full-precision network with an accuracy of 96.45%, it is only 0.78% lower.
Importantly, it achieves 12.65 times the computing speedup, 24.8 times the
storage compression ratio, and only requires a quarter of the memory overhead.

monotonically or non-monotonically, depending on the relative numbers of the
accessible to the inaccessible modes, which forms a sharp contrast with the

processes in a large number of scientific fields, ranging from finance to
biology. In many applications standard local models are not sufficient to
accurately account for certain non-local phenomena such as, e.g., interactions
at a distance. In order to properly capture these phenomena non-local nonlinear
PDE models are frequently employed in the literature. In this article we
propose two numerical methods based on machine learning and on Picard
iterations, respectively, to approximately solve non-local nonlinear PDEs. The
proposed machine learning-based method is an extended variant of a deep
learning-based splitting-up type approximation method previously introduced in
the literature and utilizes neural networks to provide approximate solutions on
a subset of the spatial domain of the solution. The Picard iterations-based
method is an extended variant of the so-called full history recursive
multilevel Picard approximation scheme previously introduced in the literature
and provides an approximate solution for a single point of the domain. Both
methods are mesh-free and allow non-local nonlinear PDEs with Neumann boundary
conditions to be solved in high dimensions. In the two methods, the numerical
difficulties arising due to the dimensionality of the PDEs are avoided by (i)
using the correspondence between the expected trajectory of reflected
stochastic processes and the solution of PDEs (given by the Feynman-Kac
formula) and by (ii) using a plain vanilla Monte Carlo integration to handle
the non-local term. We evaluate the performance of the two methods on five
different PDEs arising in physics and biology. In all cases, the methods yield
good results in up to 10 dimensions with short run times. Our work extends
recently developed methods to overcome the curse of dimensionality in solving

formalizes a new concept of physical interpretability which assesses how a ML

develops a novel contingency analysis warm starter for MadIoT cyberattack,

of an ML model that can incorporate diverse domain knowledge and improve on

assessments of the anthropogenic climate change. This uncertainty arises in
part from the difficulty in measuring the vertical distributions of aerosols,
and only sporadic vertically resolved observations are available. We often have
to settle for less informative vertically aggregated proxies such as aerosol
optical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework for the vertical
disaggregation of AOD into extinction profiles, i.e. the measure of light
extinction throughout an atmospheric column, using readily available vertically
resolved meteorological predictors such as temperature, pressure or relative
humidity. Using Bayesian nonparametric modelling, we devise a simple Gaussian
process prior over aerosol vertical profiles and update it with AOD
observations to infer a distribution over vertical extinction profiles. To
validate our approach, we use ECHAM-HAM aerosol-climate model data which offers
self-consistent simulations of meteorological covariates, AOD and extinction
profiles. Our results show that, while very simple, our model is able to
reconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty,
outperforming by an order of magnitude the idealized baseline which is
typically used in satellite AOD retrieval algorithms. In particular, the model
demonstrates a faithful reconstruction of extinction patterns arising from
aerosol water uptake in the boundary layer. Observations however suggest that
other extinction patterns, due to aerosol mass concentration, particle size and
radiative properties, might be more challenging to capture and require
additional vertically resolved predictors.

unprecedented fine-tunning problem. This motivates one to modify Einstein's
space-time geometry of General Relativity. The $f(Q)$ modified theory of
gravity is an alternative theory to General Relativity, where the non-metricity
scalar $Q$ is the responsible candidate for gravitational interactions. In the
present work we consider a Friedmann-Lem\^aitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological
model dominated by bulk viscous cosmic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity with the
functional form $f(Q)=\alpha Q^n$, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are free parameters
of the model. We constrain our model with the recent Pantheon supernovae data
set of 1048 data points, Hubble data set of 31 data points and baryon acoustic
oscillations data set consisting of six points. For higher values of redshift,
it is clear that the $f(Q)$ cosmology better fits data than standard cosmology.
We present the evolution of our deceleration parameter with redshift and it
properly predicts a transition from decelerated to accelerated phases of the
universe expansion. Also, we present the evolution of density, bulk viscous
pressure and the effective equation of state parameter with redshift. Those
show that bulk viscosity in a cosmic fluid is a valid candidate to acquire the
negative pressure to drive the cosmic expansion efficiently.We also examine the
behavior of different energy conditions to test the viability of our
cosmological $f(Q)$ model. Furthermore, the statefinder diagnostics are also
investigated in order to distinguish among different dark energy models.

the consumption and operation of hybrid clouds. Today's cloud brokers attempt
to insulate consumers from the vagaries of multiple clouds. To achieve the
insulation, the modern cloud broker needs to disguise itself as the
end-provider to consumers by creating and operating a virtual data center
construct that we call a meta-cloud, which is assembled on top of a set of
participating supplier clouds. It is crucial for such a cloud broker to be
considered a trusted partner both by cloud consumers and by the underpinning
cloud suppliers. A fundamental tenet of brokerage trust is vendor neutrality.
On the one hand, cloud consumers will be comfortable if a cloud broker
guarantees that they will not be led through a preferred path. And on the other
hand, cloud suppliers would be more interested in partnering with a cloud
broker who promises a fair apportioning of client provisioning requests.
Because consumer and supplier trust on a meta-cloud broker stems from the
assumption of being agnostic to supplier clouds, there is a need for a test
strategy that verifies the fairness of cloud brokerage. In this paper, we
propose a calculus of fairness that defines the rules to determine the
operational behavior of a cloud broker. The calculus uses temporal logic to
model the fact that fairness is a trait that has to be ascertained over time;
it is not a characteristic that can be judged at a per-request fulfillment
level. Using our temporal calculus of fairness as the basis, we propose an
algorithm to determine the fairness of a broker probabilistically, based on its
observed request apportioning policies. Our model for the fairness of cloud
broker behavior also factors in inter-provider variables such as cost
divergence and capacity variance.

the field of machine learning, deep neural network (DNN) has emerged as a

proposed INNER to conduct individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid
use. Intensive simulations and an analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery
in the Analgesic Outcomes Study (AOS) show that the proposed INNER not only can
accurately predict the preoperative opioid use using preoperative
characteristics as DNN, but also can estimate the patient specific odds of
opioid use without pain and the odds ratio of opioid use for a unit increase in
the reported overall body pain, leading to more straightforward interpretations
of the tendency to use opioids than DNN. Our results identify the patient
characteristics that are strongly associated with opioid use and is largely
consistent with the previous findings, providing evidence that INNER is a
useful tool for individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid use.

biology, has been recognized as one of the next-generation neural networks.
Conventionally, SNNs can be obtained by converting from pre-trained Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs) by replacing the non-linear activation with spiking
neurons without changing the parameters. In this work, we argue that simply
copying and pasting the weights of ANN to SNN inevitably results in activation
mismatch, especially for ANNs that are trained with batch normalization (BN)
layers. To tackle the activation mismatch issue, we first provide a theoretical
analysis by decomposing local conversion error to clipping error and flooring
error, and then quantitatively measure how this error propagates throughout the
layers using the second-order analysis. Motivated by the theoretical results,
we propose a set of layer-wise parameter calibration algorithms, which adjusts
the parameters to minimize the activation mismatch. Extensive experiments for
the proposed algorithms are performed on modern architectures and large-scale
tasks including ImageNet classification and MS COCO detection. We demonstrate
that our method can handle the SNN conversion with batch normalization layers
and effectively preserve the high accuracy even in 32 time steps. For example,
our calibration algorithms can increase up to 65% accuracy when converting

it allows exploration of scenarios and assessment of methods in settings with
full control of ground truth. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are well
established for encoding the dependence structure over a collection of
variables in both inference and simulation settings. However, while modern
machine learning is applied to data of an increasingly complex nature,
DAG-based simulation frameworks are still confined to settings with relatively
simple variable types and functional forms. We here present DagSim, a
Python-based framework for DAG-based data simulation without any constraints on
variable types or functional relations. A succinct YAML format for defining the
simulation model structure promotes transparency, while separate user-provided
functions for generating each variable based on its parents ensure simulation
code modularization. We illustrate the capabilities of DagSim through use cases
where metadata variables control shapes in an image and patterns in
bio-sequences.

  noncommutative tori","19 pages",,,,"math.QA math.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the well known relationship between theta functions and
Heisenberg group actions thereon is resumed by merging complex algebraic and
noncommutative geometry: in essence, we describe Hermitian-Einstein vector
bundles on 2-tori via representations of noncommutative tori, thereby
reconstructing Matsushima's setup and making the ensuing Fourier-Mukai-Nahm
(FMN) aspects transparent. We prove the existence of noncommutative torus
actions on the space of smooth sections of Hermitian-Einstein vector bundles on
2-tori preserving the eigenspaces of a natural Laplace operator. Motivated by
the Coherent State Transform approach to theta functions, we extend the latter
to vector valued thetas and develop an additional algebraic reinterpretation of
Matsushima's theory making FMN-duality manifest again.

spontaneous coherent configurations of the electromagnetic field in interaction
with charged bosons in a regular lattice. The bosons tend to oscillate at their
plasma frequency, but are also subjected to electrostatic forces which keep
them confined close to lattice sites and cause a frequency shift in the
oscillation. Under certain conditions on these frequencies, we find that a
suitably defined set of coherent states (coherent both in the field and matter
degrees of freedom) exhibit a negative energy gap with respect to the
perturbative ground state. This is true in the RWA approximation and for
position-independent fields, both to first and second order in the interaction
Hamiltonian. We compare this result with other recent findings from cavity QED
and notice that: (1) consideration of full 3D wavefunctions and a careful
definition of the coherent states are essential for obtaining the energy gap;
(2) although our calculation is referred to bosons, it may also apply to
protons bound in a crystal matrix, if their density is very low compared to the
density of available states.

Luruaco lake, located in Atl\'antico Department, Colombia. The velocity field
is obtained through a two-dimensional horizontal (2DH) model of Navier-Stokes
equations system. The transport equation of faecal coliforms concentration is
provided from a convective-diffusive-reactive equation. The lake's geometry is
built through cubic spline and multi-block methods. The discretization method
by Finite Differences and the First Order Upwind (FOU) are applied to the 2DH
model. The Mark and Cell (MAC) method is used to determine numerically the
velocity field of water flow. Numerical simulations are carried out for a
72-hour period in order to understand the influence of faecal coliforms
injections from each tributary. From the qualitative and quantitative analysis
of the factors that influence faecal coliforms dynamics, proposals are
presented, which aim to reduce contamination in some regions of Lake Luruaco.
The numerical simulations show that the best option to improve water quality in
the lake is the implementation of two actions, the diversion of the Lim\'on
stream to the Negro stream and the installation of a sewage treatment plant at
the mouth of the Negro stream. Other less expensive proposals are also
presented.

fool text classification models. In such attack, an adversary keeps sending
crafted adversarial queries to the target model until it can successfully
achieve the intended outcome. State-of-the-art attack methods usually require
hundreds or thousands of queries to find one adversarial example. In this
paper, we study whether a sophisticated adversary can attack the system with
much less queries. We propose a simple yet efficient method that can reduce the
average number of adversarial queries by 3-30 times and maintain the attack
effectiveness. This research highlights that an adversary can fool a deep NLP
model with much less cost.
