ones. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the forefront of the
recent advances in this field. One popular CNN-based approach involves the
application of generated kernels to the input frames to obtain an interpolated
frame. Despite all the benefits interpolation methods offer, many of these
networks require a lot of parameters, with more parameters meaning a heavier
computational burden. Reducing the size of the model typically impacts
performance negatively. This paper presents a method for parameter reduction
for a popular flow-less kernel-based network (Adaptive Collaboration of Flows).
Through our technique of removing the layers that require the most parameters
and replacing them with smaller encoders, we reduce the number of parameters of
the network and even achieve better performance compared to the original
method. This is achieved by deploying rotation to force each individual encoder
to learn different features from the input images. Ablations are conducted to
justify design choices and an evaluation on how our method performs on
full-length videos is presented.

the off-diagonal and off mass-shell mesonic T-matrix, with no contribution to

far, most long-term policies to decrease the carbon footprint of our societies
consider the cost of the system as the leading indicator in the energy system
models. This paper is the first to develop a novel approach by adding the
energy return on investment (EROI) to a whole energy system optimization model.
We built the database with all EROI technologies and resources considered. In
addition, moving away from fossil-based to carbon-neutral energy systems raises
the issue of the uncertainty of low-carbon technologies and resource data.
Thus, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify the main
parameters driving the variations in the EROI of the system. This novel
approach can be applied to any energy system, and we use a real-world case
study to illustrate the model: the 2035 Belgian energy system for several
greenhouse gas emissions targets.
  The main results are threefold: (i) the EROI of the system decreases from 8.9
to 3.9 when greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 5; (ii) the renewable fuels
- mainly imported renewable gas - represent the largest share of the system
primary energy mix; (iii) in the sensitivity analysis, the renewable fuels
drive 67% of the variation of the EROI of the system for low greenhouse gas
emissions scenarios. The decrease in the EROI raises questions about meeting
the climate targets without adverse socio-economic impact. Most countries rely
massively on fossil fuels, and they could encounter an EROI decline when
shifting to carbon neutrality. Thus, this study demonstrates the importance of
considering other criteria, such as EROI, in energy system models.

selectively characterizing the behavior of functional molecules, especially in
the presence of bimolecular processes. We present the tools for simulating the
jump dynamics both in the macroscopic limit and in the small-volume sample
where the numbers of reactive molecules are of the order of few units with an
inherently stochastic kinetics. The focus is on how an ideal spatial
""compartmentalization"" may affect the dynamical features of the tagged

supramolecular pump composed of ring-like and axle-like molecules that
dynamically assemble and disassemble, originating an average ring-through-axle
directed motion under constant irradiation. In such an example, the dynamical
feature of interest is the completion time of direct/inverse cycles of tagged
rings and axles. We find a surprisingly strong robustness of the average cycle
times with respect to the system's size. This is explained in the presence of
rate-determining unimolecular processes, which may, therefore, play a crucial
role in stabilizing the behavior of small chemical systems against strong
fluctuations in the number of molecules.

100 such systems are known. Most of them have been studied in X-rays. In this
paper we study the six remaining massive clusters in this redshift interval in
the highly complete CLASSIX survey which have so far not been observed with
sufficiently deep exposures in X-rays. With data from our new XMM-Newton
observations we characterise their structures, derive X-ray properties such as
the X-ray luminosity and intra-cluster medium temperature and estimate their
gas and total masses. We find that one cluster, RXCJ1230.7+3439, is dynamically
young with three distinct substructures in the cluster outskirts and
RXCJ1310.9+2157/RXCJ1310.4+2151 is a double cluster system. Mass determination
is difficult in the systems with substructure. We therefore discuss several
methods of mass estimation including scaling relations. In summary we find that
five of the six study targets are indeed massive clusters as expected, while
the last cluster RXCJ2116.2-0309 is a close projection of a distant and a
nearby cluster which has led to a previous overestimation of its mass. In the
XMM-Newton observation fields we also find three low redshift clusters close to
the targets which are also analysed and described here. In the field of
RXCJ2116.2-0309 we discover serendipitously a highly variable X-ray source

electrons to measure charged particle trajectories and energy. In a LArTPC, the

collected means that diffusion can smear the charge by an amount comparable to
the spatial resolution of the detector, given by the spacing between charge
sensing channels ($\sim$mm). This smearing has an impact on the distribution of
energy losses measured by each channel. In particular, the smearing increases
the length of the charged particle trajectory observed by each channel, and
therefore the most-probable-value (MPV) of particle energy loss recorded by
that channel. We find, for example, that this effect shifts the MPV $dE/dx$ of
a muon with an energy of 1 GeV by ${\sim}4$% for a 2 ms drift time and 4.7 mm

amplitude (LCDA) on a parton momentum fraction $x$ by directly solving the
dispersion relations for the moments with inputs from the operator product
expansion (OPE) of the corresponding correlation function. It is noticed that
these dispersion relations must be organized into those for the Gegenbauer
coefficients first in order to avoid the ill-posed problem appearing in the
conversion from the moments to the Gegenbauer coefficients. Given the values of
various condensates in the OPE, we find that a solution for the pion LCDA,
which is stable in the Gegenbauer expansion, exists. Moreover, the solution
from summing contributions up to 18 Gegenbauer polynomials is smooth, and can
be well approximated by a function proportional to $x^p(1-x)^p$ with $p\approx
0.45$ at the scale $\mu=2$ GeV. Turning off the condensates, we get the
asymptotic form, independent of the scale $\mu$, for the pion LCDA as expected.
We then solve for the pion LCDA at a different scale $\mu=1.5$ GeV with the
condensate inputs at this $\mu$, and demonstrate that the result is consistent
with the one obtained by evolving the Gegenbauer coefficients from $\mu=2$ GeV
to 1.5 GeV. That is, our formalism is compatible with the QCD evolution. The
strength of the above approach that goes beyond analyses limited to only the
first few moments of a LCDA in conventional QCD sum rules is highlighted. The
precision of our results can be improved systematically by including
higher-order and higher-power terms in the OPE.

adjusting the frequency detuning pressure between the driving field and the

they prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing
behaviors respond to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by
supply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where
the agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local
abundance of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then
discover a niche of transporting goods between regions with different
prevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can buy goods where
they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of
ablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards,
bartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods
can either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior. This work is

XFC for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is to avoid lithium plating. Although
significant research is taking place to enable XFC, no promising
technology/strategy has still emerged for mainstream commercial LIBs. Here, we
propose a thermally modulated charging protocol (TMCP) by active thermal
switching for XFC, i.e., retaining the battery heat during XFC with the switch
OFF for boosting the kinetics to avoid lithium plating while dissipating the
heat after XFC with the switch ON for reducing side reactions. Our proposed
TMCP strategy enables XFC of commercial high-energy-density LIBs with charge
time <15 min and >500 cycles while simultaneously beating other targets set by
US Department of energy (discharge energy density > 180 Wh/kg and capacity loss
< 4.5%). Further, we develop a thermal switch based on shape memory alloy and
demonstrate the feasibility of integrating our TMCP in commercial battery
thermal management system.

practices are concerned, and on what researchers think of the term.
Methodology: We invited one researcher for each of the official disciplinary
areas represented within the department and all 19 accepted to participate in
the study. Participants were then divided into 5 main research areas: philology
and literary criticism, language and linguistics, history of art, computer
science, archival studies. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a
grounded theory approach. Findings: A list of 13 research data types has been
compiled thanks to the information collected from participants. The term ""data""
does not emerge as especially problematic, although a good deal of confusion
remains. Looking at current research management practices, methodologies and
teamwork appear more central than previously reported. Originality: Our
findings confirm that ""data"" within the FAIR framework should include all types
of input and outputs humanities research work with, including publications.
Also, the participants to this study appear ready for a discussion around
making their research data FAIR: they do not find the terminology particularly
problematic, while they rely on precise and recognised methodologies, as well
as on sharing and collaboration with colleagues.

clusters. We find that both observations and simulations of galaxy clusters
show an excess of anisotropic satellite distributions. On average, satellites
in clusters have a higher degree of anisotropy than their counterparts in
Milky-Way-mass hosts once we account for the difference in their radial
distributions. The normal vector of the plane of satellites is strongly aligned
with the host halo's minor axis, while the alignment with the large-scale
structure is weak. At fixed cluster mass, the degree of anisotropy is higher at
higher redshift. This reflects the highly anisotropic nature of satellites
accretion points, a feature that is partly erased by the subsequent orbital
evolution of the satellites. We also find that satellite galaxies are mostly
accreted singly so group accretion is not the explanation for the high
flattening of the planes of satellites.

The values of the options must be associated with information about the action

problem through use of distinct population subspaces. To test this hypothesis,
we examined the responses of single neurons in five reward-sensitive regions in
rhesus macaques performing a risky choice task. In all areas, neurons encoded
the value of the offers presented on both the left and the right side of the
display in semi-orthogonal subspaces, which served to bind the values of the
two offers to their positions in space. Supporting the idea that this
orthogonalization is functionally meaningful, we observed a session-to-session
covariation between choice behavior and the orthogonalization of the two value
subspaces: trials with less orthogonalized subspaces were associated with
greater likelihood of choosing the less valued option. Further inspection
revealed that these semi-orthogonal subspaces arose from a combination of
linear and nonlinear mixed selectivity in the neural population. We show this
combination of selectivity balances reliable binding with an ability to
generalize value across different spatial locations. These results support the
hypothesis that semi-orthogonal subspaces support reliable binding, which is
essential to flexible behavior in the face of multiple options.

non-commutative ""universal"" ring - a purely algebraic analogue of the ring of
pseudodifferential operators on a manifold, and admit (under certain mild
restrictions) a convenient algebraic-geometric description. An important
algebraic part of this description is the Schur-Sato theory - a generalisation
of the well known theory for ordinary differential operators. Some parts of
this theory were developed earlier in a series of papers, mostly for dimension
two.
  In this paper we present this theory in arbitrary dimension. We apply this
theory to prove two classification theorems of quasi-elliptic rings in terms of

trials, often used in their stead to investigate and determine treatment
efficacy. Due to lack of sample size, observational studies commonly combine
data from multiple sources or different sites/centers. Despite the benefits of
an increased sample size, a naive combination of multicenter data may result in
incongruities stemming from center-specific protocols for generating cohorts or
reactions towards treatments distinct to a given center, among other things.
These issues arise in a variety of other contexts, including capturing a
treatment effect related to an individual's unique biological characteristics.
Existing methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects have not
adequately addressed the multicenter context, but rather treat it simply as a
means to obtain sufficient sample size. Additionally, previous approaches to
estimating treatment effects do not straightforwardly generalize to the
multicenter design, especially when required to provide treatment insights for
patients from a new, unobserved center. To address these shortcomings, we
propose Multiple Domain Causal Networks (MDCN), an approach that simultaneously
strengthens the information sharing between similar centers while addressing
the selection bias in treatment assignment through learning of a new feature
embedding. In empirical evaluations, MDCN is consistently more accurate when
estimating the heterogeneous treatment effect in new centers compared to
benchmarks that adjust solely based on treatment imbalance or general center
differences. Finally, we justify our approach by providing theoretical analyses
that demonstrate that MDCN improves on the generalization bound of the new,

  Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)",,,,"cs.IT cs.DC cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed storage systems must store large amounts of data over long
periods of time. To avoid data loss due to device failures, an $[n,k]$ erasure
code is used to encode $k$ data symbols into a codeword of $n$ symbols that are
stored across different devices. However, device failure rates change
throughout the life of the data, and tuning $n$ and $k$ according to these
changes has been shown to save significant storage space. Code conversion is
the process of converting multiple codewords of an initial $[n^I,k^I]$ code
into codewords of a final $[n^F,k^F]$ code that decode to the same set of data
symbols. In this paper, we study conversion bandwidth, defined as the total
amount of data transferred between nodes during conversion. In particular, we
consider the case where the initial and final codes are MDS and a single
initial codeword is split into several final codewords ($k^I=\lambda^F k^F$ for
integer $\lambda^F \geq 2$), called the split regime. We derive lower bounds on
the conversion bandwidth in the split regime and propose constructions that
significantly reduce conversion bandwidth and are optimal for certain
parameters.

the fact that KRR sequentially learns functions of increasing complexity as the
sample size increases; when $d^{k-1}\ll n\ll d^{k}$, only polynomials with
degree less than $k$ are learned. In this paper, we present sharp asymptotic
characterization of the performance of KRR at the critical transition regions

provides a precise picture of the whole learning process and clarifies the

cooperatively with other agents. An agent may decide to transmit a certain

demonstrated high-quality results for blind face restoration, producing
fine-grained facial details faithful to inputs remains a challenging problem.
Motivated by the classical dictionary-based methods and the recent vector
quantization (VQ) technique, we propose a VQ-based face restoration method -
VQFR. VQFR takes advantage of high-quality low-level feature banks extracted
from high-quality faces and can thus help recover realistic facial details.
However, the simple application of the VQ codebook cannot achieve good results
with faithful details and identity preservation. Therefore, we further
introduce two special network designs. 1). We first investigate the compression
patch size in the VQ codebook and find that the VQ codebook designed with a
proper compression patch size is crucial to balance the quality and fidelity.
2). To further fuse low-level features from inputs while not ""contaminating""
the realistic details generated from the VQ codebook, we proposed a parallel
decoder consisting of a texture decoder and a main decoder. Those two decoders
then interact with a texture warping module with deformable convolution.
Equipped with the VQ codebook as a facial detail dictionary and the parallel
decoder design, the proposed VQFR can largely enhance the restored quality of
facial details while keeping the fidelity to previous methods.

importance to be able to predict sudden loss of load-carrying capacity and
prevent catastrophic failure under severe dynamic loading conditions.
Second-order phase-field fracture models have gained wide adoption given their
ability to capture the formation of complex fracture patterns, e.g. via crack
merging and branching, and their suitability for implementation within the
context of the conventional finite element method. Higher-order phase-field
models have also been proposed to increase the regularity of the exact solution
and thus increase the spatial convergence rate of its numerical approximation.
However, they require special numerical techniques to enforce the necessary
continuity of the phase field solution. In this paper, we derive a fourth-order
phase-field model of fracture in two independent ways; namely, from Hamilton's
principle and from a higher-order micromechanics-based approach. The latter
approach is novel, and provides a physical interpretation of the higher-order
terms in the model. In addition, we propose a continuous/discontinuous Galerkin
(C/DG) method for use in computing the approximate phase-field solution. This
method employs Lagrange polynomial shape functions to guarantee
$C^0$-continuity of the solution at inter-element boundaries, and enforces the
required $C^1$ regularity with the aid of additional variational and interior
penalty terms in the weak form. The phase-field equation is coupled with the
momentum balance equation to model dynamic fracture problems in hyper-elastic
materials. Two benchmark problems are presented to compare the numerical
behavior of the C/DG method with mixed finite element methods.

These couplings induce variations in fundamental constants, i.e., particle

pulsars, inducing pulsar spin fluctuations via conservation of angular

framework of galaxy formation and evolution theories. While a classical
bulge+disc decomposition of disc galaxies is usually taken as granted, this is
only rarely solidly founded upon the full exploitation of the richness of data
arising from spectroscopic studies with integral field units. In this work we
describe a fully Bayesian estimation method of the global structure of disc
galaxies which makes use of the wealth of photometric, kinematic, and
mass-to-light ratio data, and that can be seen as a first step towards a
machine-learning approach, certainly needed when dealing with larger samples of
galaxies. Ours is a novel, hybrid line of action in tackling the problem of
galactic parameter estimation, neither purely photometric nor orbit-based.
Being rooted on a nested sampler, our code, which is available publicly as an
online repository, allows for a statistical assessment of the need for multiple
components in the dissecting process. As a first case-study the GPU-optimized
code is applied to the S0 galaxy NGC-7683, finding that in this galaxy a
pseudo-bulge, possibly the remnant of a bar-like structure, does exist in the
center of the system. These results are then tested against the publicly
available, orbit-based code DYNAMITE, finding substantial agreement.

feature turbulent line widths that are significantly higher, and scale with

Galactic region, the stellar density is also much higher than in the rest of
the Milky Way, and the vertical stellar velocity dispersion is large, meaning
that even young stars are likely to cross the entire vertical extent of the CMZ
within their lifetimes. Here, we investigate whether interactions of CMZ
molecular clouds with crossing stars can account for the extraordinary
properties of observed turbulence in this part of the Galaxy. We calculated the
rate of energy deposition by stars crossing CMZ clouds due to (a) stellar winds
and (b) dynamical friction, and compared it to the rate of turbulence decay. We
calculated the predicted scaling of turbulence line width with cloud size in
each case. We find that energy deposition by stellar winds of crossing massive
stars can account for both the level and the scaling of CMZ cloud turbulence
with cloud size. We also find that the mechanism stops being effective at a
Galactocentric distance comparable to the CMZ extent. On the other hand, we
find that dynamical friction by crossing stars does not constitute a
significant driver of turbulence for CMZ clouds.

twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), it was shown that, in addition to the graphene
phonons, there is another set of gapless excitations termed Moir\'e Phonons
[Phys. Rev. B, 075416, 2019] reflecting the lattice dynamics at the Moire
superlattice level. These modes were later suggested to be phasons due to the
incommensurate stacking of the two graphene layers [Phys. Rev. B, 155426,

distinct perspectives by identifying an underlying symmetry, which we dub
mismatch symmetry, that exists for any twist angle. For commensurate angles,
this is a discrete symmetry whereas for incommensurate angles, it is equivalent
to a continuous phase symmetry giving rise to phason modes. In the small angle
limit, such symmetry becomes a continuous local symmetry whose spontaneous
breaking gives rise to Moir\'e phonons as its Goldstone mode. We derive an
effective field theory for these collective modes in TBG in precise agreement
with the full model and discuss their different properties. Our analysis is
then generalized to twisted multilayer graphene (TMG) where we identify higher
order mismatch and deduce the count of gapless modes including graphene
phonons, Moir\'e phonons and phasons. Especially, we study twisted
mirror-symmetric trilayer graphene with an alternating twist angle $\theta$ and
find that it can be mapped to a TBG with the re-scaled twist angle
$\sqrt{2/3}\theta$, hosting the same Moir\'e phonon modes in the even mirror

(e.g., network latency). Historically, this tradeoff has not been a bottleneck
for most blockchains. However, an emerging host of blockchain-based
applications (e.g., decentralized finance) are increasingly sensitive to
latency; users who can reduce their network latency relative to other users can
accrue (sometimes significant) financial gains. In this work, we initiate the
study of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks. We first
define two classes of latency that are of interest in blockchain applications.
We then show empirically that a strategic agent who controls only their local
peering decisions can manipulate both types of latency, achieving 60\% of the
global latency gains provided by the centralized, paid service bloXroute, or,
in targeted scenarios, comparable gains. Finally, we show that our results are
not due to the poor design of existing P2P networks. Under a simple network
model, we theoretically prove that an adversary can always manipulate the P2P
network's latency to their advantage, provided the network experiences
sufficient peer churn and transaction activity.

symmetric, and nonnegative operator. The wide class of operators we consider
includes, but is not limited to, L\'evy operators. Our quantitative estimates
take the form of precise $L^1$--$L^\infty$-smoothing effects and absolute
bounds, and their proofs are based on the interplay between a dual formulation
of the problem and estimates on the Green function of $-\mathfrak{L}$ and
$I-\mathfrak{L}$.
  In the linear case $m=1$, it is well-known that the
$L^1$--$L^\infty$-smoothing effect, or ultracontractivity, is equivalent to
Nash inequalities. This is also equivalent to heat kernel estimates, which
imply the Green function estimates that represent a key ingredient in our
techniques.
  We establish a similar scenario in the nonlinear setting $m>1$. First, we can
show that operators for which ultracontractivity holds, also provide
$L^1$--$L^\infty$-smoothing effects in the nonlinear case. The converse
implication is not true in general. A counterexample is given by $0$-order
L\'evy operators like $-\mathfrak{L}=I-J\ast$. They do not regularize when
$m=1$, but we show that surprisingly enough they do so when $m>1$, due to the
convex nonlinearity. This reveals a striking property of nonlinear equations:
the nonlinearity allows for better regularizing properties, almost
independently of the linear operator.
  Finally, we show that smoothing effects, both linear and nonlinear, imply
families of inequalities of Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type, and we explore
equivalences both in the linear and nonlinear settings through the application
of the Moser iteration.

their prohibitive cost and limited scalability, such instruments suffer from

generalizing the forward-back-half forward splitting and the Tseng's algorithm

using a line search in which the monotone-Lipschitzian and the cocoercive

non-linearly constrained composite convex optimization problems in real Hilbert

systems, with high user density, is challenging due to the network structure
with limited transmit power budget and resource blocks. Smart resource
allocation methods, such as user scheduling, power allocation, and modulation
and coding scheme selection, must be implemented to cope with the challenge.
Aiming to enhance the number of served users with minimum QoS in the downlink
(DL) channel of crowded extra-large scale massive multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, in this paper we propose a QoS-aware joint
user scheduling and power allocation technique. The proposed technique is
constituted by two sequential procedures: the clique search-based scheduling
(CBS) algorithm for user scheduling followed by optimal power allocation with
transmit power budget and minimum achievable rate per user constraints. To
accurately evaluate the proposed technique in the XL-MIMO scenario, we propose
a generalized non-stationary multi-state channel model based on spherical-wave
propagation assuming that users under LoS and NLoS transmission coexist in the
same communication cell. Such model considers that users under different
channel states experience different propagation aspects both in the multipath
fading model and the path loss rule. Numerical results on the achievable
sum-rate, number of scheduled users, and distribution of the scheduled users
reveal that the proposed CBS algorithm provides a fair coverage over the whole
cell area, achieving remarkable numbers of scheduled users when users under the
LoS and NLoS channel states coexist in the communication cell.

  Bottleneck Approach","Provisionally accepted to MICCAI 2022 on May 4, 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical shape modeling (SSM) directly from 3D medical images is an
underutilized tool for detecting pathology, diagnosing disease, and conducting
population-level morphology analysis. Deep learning frameworks have increased
the feasibility of adopting SSM in medical practice by reducing the
expert-driven manual and computational overhead in traditional SSM workflows.
However, translating such frameworks to clinical practice requires calibrated
uncertainty measures as neural networks can produce over-confident predictions
that cannot be trusted in sensitive clinical decision-making. Existing
techniques for predicting shape with aleatoric (data-dependent) uncertainty
utilize a principal component analysis (PCA) based shape representation
computed in isolation from the model training. This constraint restricts the
learning task to solely estimating pre-defined shape descriptors from 3D images
and imposes a linear relationship between this shape representation and the
output (i.e., shape) space. In this paper, we propose a principled framework
based on the variational information bottleneck theory to relax these
assumptions while predicting probabilistic shapes of anatomy directly from
images without supervised encoding of shape descriptors. Here, the latent
representation is learned in the context of the learning task, resulting in a
more scalable, flexible model that better captures data non-linearity.
Additionally, this model is self-regularized and generalizes better given
limited training data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
provides improved accuracy and better calibrated aleatoric uncertainty
estimates than state-of-the-art methods.

information via a collection of continuous, truncated, ordinal, and binary
variables. To gain novel insights in understanding complex interactions between
collected variables, there is a critical need for the development of flexible
frameworks for joint modeling of mixed data types variables. We propose
Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression modeling (SGCRM) that allows to model
a joint dependence structure between observed continuous, truncated, ordinal,
and binary variables and to construct conditional models with these four data
types as outcomes with a guarantee that derived conditional models are mutually
consistent. Semiparametric Gaussian Copula (SGC) mechanism assumes that
observed SGC variables are generated by - i) monotonically transforming
marginals of latent multivariate normal random variable and ii)
dichotimizing/truncating these transformed marginals. SGCRM estimates the
correlation matrix of the latent normal variables through an inversion of
""bridges"" between Kendall's Tau rank correlations of observed mixed data type
variables and latent Gaussian correlations. We derive a novel bridging result
to deal with a general ordinal variable. In addition to the previously
established asymptotic consistency, we establish asymptotic normality of the
latent correlation estimators. We also establish the asymptotic normality of
SGCRM regression estimators and provide a computationally efficient way to
calculate asymptotic covariances. We propose computationally efficient methods
to predict SGC latent variables and to do imputation of missing data. Using
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we illustrate SGCRM
and compare it with the traditional conditional regression models including
truncated Gaussian regression, ordinal probit, and probit models.

approaches to super learning may have poor performance in settings where
extreme values are present, such as healthcare expenditure data. We propose a
super learner based on the Huber loss, a ""robust"" loss function that combines
squared error loss with absolute loss to down-weight the influence of outliers.
We derive oracle inequalities that establish bounds on the finite-sample and
asymptotic performance of the method. We show that the proposed method can be
used both directly to optimize Huber risk, as well as in finite-sample settings
where optimizing mean squared error is the ultimate goal. For this latter
scenario, we provide two methods for performing a grid search for values of the
robustification parameter indexing the Huber loss. Simulations and real data

costly, difficult to reproduce, and non-reusable. In this paper, we propose a
new and simple automatic evaluation method for NLG called Near-Negative
Distinction (NND) that repurposes prior human annotations into NND tests. In an
NND test, an NLG model must place a higher likelihood on a high-quality output
candidate than on a near-negative candidate with a known error. Model
performance is established by the number of NND tests a model passes, as well
as the distribution over task-specific errors the model fails on. Through
experiments on three NLG tasks (question generation, question answering, and
summarization), we show that NND achieves a higher correlation with human
judgments than standard NLG evaluation metrics. We then illustrate NND
evaluation in four practical scenarios, for example performing fine-grain model
analysis, or studying model training dynamics. Our findings suggest that NND
can give a second life to human annotations and provide low-cost NLG

root-mean-square magnetic fluctuations. In this work, direct numerical
simulations of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence influenced by
such a magnetic field are conducted for a series of cases that have identical
resolution, and increasing grid sizes up to $2048^3$. The result is a series of
closely comparable simulations at Reynolds numbers ranging from 1,400 up to

viewpoint by tracking fluid particles and calculating single-particle and
two-particle statistics. The influence of Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the
fundamental anisotropy on the MHD turbulence in these statistics is discussed.
Single-particle diffusion curves exhibit mildly superdiffusive behaviors that
differ in the direction aligned with the magnetic field and the direction
perpendicular to it. Competing alignment processes affect the dispersion of
particle pairs, in particular at the beginning of the inertial subrange of time
scales. Scalings for relative dispersion, which become clearer in the inertial

for separation of the both beams polarization matrices and the material part

arbitrary directions of propagation of both pump and Stokes light beams and
arbitrary polarizations of both beams. The expressions contain contributions
from linear dichroism and birefringence in the molecular excited states. It was
shown that, under certain conditions, both effects can be observed
simultaneously. The geometry of almost collinear propagation of the pump and
Stokes pulse beams through the molecular sample was considered, and it was
shown that the contributions from linear dichroism and birefringence to the

obtained using the polarization-modulation technique developed recently by the

can be time-consuming and costly. Consequently, deep learning-based
super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has emerged as a promising solution for
generating super-resolution (SR) images from low-resolution (LR) images.
Unfortunately, training such neural networks requires aligned authentic HR and
LR image pairs, which are challenging to obtain due to patient movements during
and between image acquisitions. While rigid movements of hard tissues can be
corrected with image registration, aligning deformed soft tissues is complex,
making it impractical to train neural networks with authentic HR and LR image
pairs. Previous studies have focused on SRR using authentic HR images and
down-sampled synthetic LR images. However, the difference in degradation
representations between synthetic and authentic LR images suppresses the
quality of SR images reconstructed from authentic LR images. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Unsupervised Degradation Adaptation Network (UDEAN).
Our network consists of a degradation learning network and an SRR network. The
degradation learning network downsamples the HR images using the degradation
representation learned from the misaligned or unpaired LR images. The SRR
network then learns the mapping from the down-sampled HR images to the original
ones. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
networks and is a promising solution to the challenges in clinical settings.

deep neural network classifiers, wherein test samples from one or more source
classes will be (mis)classified to the attacker's target class when a backdoor
pattern (BP) is embedded. In this paper, we focus on the post-training backdoor
defense scenario commonly considered in the literature, where the defender aims
to detect whether a trained classifier was backdoor attacked, without any
access to the training set. To the best of our knowledge, existing
post-training backdoor defenses are all designed for BAs with presumed BP
types, where each BP type has a specific embedding function. They may fail when
the actual BP type used by the attacker (unknown to the defender) is different
from the BP type assumed by the defender. In contrast, we propose a universal
post-training defense that detects BAs with arbitrary types of BPs, without
making any assumptions about the BP type. Our detector leverages the influence
of the BA, independently of the BP type, on the landscape of the classifier's
outputs prior to the softmax layer. For each class, a maximum margin statistic
is estimated using a set of random vectors; detection inference is then
performed by applying an unsupervised anomaly detector to these statistics.
Thus, our detector is also an advance relative to most existing post-training
methods by not needing any legitimate clean samples, and can efficiently detect
BAs with arbitrary numbers of source classes. These advantages of our detector
over several state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated on four datasets, for
three different types of BPs, and for a variety of attack configurations.
Finally, we propose a novel, general approach for BA mitigation once a
detection is made.

kilo-pixel arrays of transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers require accurate
and robust gain calibration methods. We simplify and refactor the standard TES
model to directly relate the detector responsivity calibration and optical time
constant to the measured TES current $I$ and the applied bias current
$I_{\mathrm{b}}$. The calibration method developed for the Cosmology Large
Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) TES bolometer arrays relies on current versus
voltage ($I$-$V$) measurements acquired daily prior to CMB observations. By
binning Q-band (40GHz) $I$-$V$ measurements by optical loading, we find that
the gain calibration median standard error within a bin is 0.3%. We test the
accuracy of this ""$I$-$V$ bin"" detector calibration method by using the Moon as
a photometric standard. The ratio of measured Moon amplitudes between detector
pairs sharing the same feedhorn indicates a TES calibration error of 0.5%. We
also find that for the CLASS Q-band TES array, calibrating the response of
individual detectors based solely on the applied TES bias current accurately
corrects TES gain variations across time but introduces a bias in the TES
calibration from data counts to power units. Since the TES current bias value
is set and recorded before every observation, this calibration method can
always be applied to raw TES data and is not subject to $I$-$V$ data quality or
processing errors.

systematic uncertainties can occur, and trigonometric parallaxes are generally
superior. However, for sources well past the Galactic center, 3D kinematic
distances are robust and more accurate than can usually be achieved by

significantly more resources than required for a given task. Prior work has
explored compressing models offline, such as by distilling knowledge from
larger models into much smaller ones. This is effective for compression, but
does not give an empirical method for measuring how much the model can be
compressed, and requires additional training for each compressed model. We
propose a method that requires only a single training session for the original
model and a set of compressed models. The proposed approach is a ""structural""
dropout that prunes all elements in the hidden state above a randomly chosen
index, forcing the model to learn an importance ordering over its features.
After learning this ordering, at inference time unimportant features can be
pruned while retaining most accuracy, reducing parameter size significantly. In
this work, we focus on Structural Dropout for fully-connected layers, but the
concept can be applied to any kind of layer with unordered features, such as
convolutional or attention layers. Structural Dropout requires no additional
pruning/retraining, but requires additional validation for each possible hidden
sizes. At inference time, a non-expert can select a memory versus accuracy
trade-off that best suits their needs, across a wide range of highly compressed

its effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is
challenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control
design methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows
rapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through
deep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in
different wind conditions share a common representation and that the
wind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly
uses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant
meta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12
minutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly
then uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for
mixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions
generated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to
43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight
control with substantially smaller tracking error than state-of-the-art
nonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical
performance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness
guarantees. Last, our control design extrapolates to unseen wind conditions, is
shown to be effective for outdoor flights with only onboard sensors, and can

analyze the effect of the hole-phonon coupling on the dispersion of the
quasiparticle that forms when a single hole is doped into a cuprate layer. To
model this, we start from the three-band Emery model supplemented by the
Peierls modulation of the $p$-$d$ and $p$-$p$ hoppings due to the motion of O
ions. We then project onto the strongly correlated $U_{dd}\rightarrow \infty$
limit where charge fluctuations are frozen on the Cu site. The resulting
effective Hamiltonian describes the motion of a doped hole on the O sublattice,
and its interactions with Cu spins and O phonons. We show that even though the
hole-phonon coupling is moderate to strong, it leads to only a very minor
increase of the quasiparticle's effective mass as compared to its mass in the
absence of coupling to phonons, consistent with a weak coupling to phonons of
the correlations-dressed quasiparticle. We explain the reasons for this
suppression, revealing why it is expected to happen in any systems with strong

presents stop and go waves, is proposed to simulate traffic on a ring-road.
Vehicles are divided between human-driven and autonomous vehicles (AV). Control
strategies are designed with the ultimate goal of using a small number of AVs
(less than 5\% penetration rate) to represent Lagrangian control actuators that
can smooth the multilane traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves. This
in turn may reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
  The lane-changing mechanism is based on three components that we treat as
parameters in the model: safety, incentive and cool-down time. The choice of
these parameters in the lane-change mechanism is critical to modeling traffic
accurately, because different parameter values can lead to drastically
different traffic behaviors. In particular, the number of lane-changes and the
speed variance are highly affected by the choice of parameters. Despite this
modeling issue, when using sufficiently simple and robust controllers for AVs,
the stabilization of uniform flow steady-state is effective for any realistic
value of the parameters, and ultimately bypasses the observed modeling issue.
Our approach is based on accurate and rigorous mathematical models, which
allows a limit procedure that is termed, in gas dynamic terminology,
mean-field. In simple words, from increasing the human-driven population to
infinity, a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations are
obtained. Moreover, control problems also pass to the limit, allowing the
design to be tackled at different scales.

A major thrust of those investigations has been to understand how Saturn formed
and evolved and to place Saturn in the context of other gas giants and
planetary systems in general. Two models have been proposed for the formation
of the giant planets,the core accretion model and the disk instability model.
The heavy element enrichment, core size, and internal structure of Saturn,
compared to Jupiter strongly favor the core accretion model as for Jupiter. Two
features of the core accretion model that are distinct from the disk
instability model are the growth of a core with a mass several times that of
the Earth, followed by runaway collapse of gas onto the core once a mass
threshold is reached. The heavy element core grows slowly over millions of
years through accretion of cm-m sized pebbles, even larger bodies, and moon
sized embryos in the gaseous disk. The abundance pattern of heavy elements is
thus a key constraint on formation models. C, N, S, and P at Saturn are
presently known to varying degree of uncertainty. The He to H ratio in the
atmosphere is crucial for understanding heat balance, interior processes, and
planetary evolution, but present values at Saturn range from low to high,
allowing for a wide range of possibilities. While the very low values are
favored to explain excess luminosity, high values might indicate presence of
layered convection in the interior, resulting in slow cooling. Additional
insight into Saturn's formation comes from the unique data on the rings from
Cassini's Grand Finale orbits. While the solar system is the only analog for
the extra solar systems, detection of the alkali metals and water in giant
exoplanets is useful for understanding the formation and evolution of Saturn,

which the two models are iteratively updated based on the jointly synthesized
examples. The first flow model is a normalizing flow that transforms an initial
simple density to a target density by applying a sequence of invertible
transformations. The second flow model is a Langevin flow that runs finite
steps of gradient-based MCMC toward an energy-based model. We start from
proposing a generative framework that trains an energy-based model with a
normalizing flow as an amortized sampler to initialize the MCMC chains of the
energy-based model. In each learning iteration, we generate synthesized
examples by using a normalizing flow initialization followed by a short-run
Langevin flow revision toward the current energy-based model. Then we treat the
synthesized examples as fair samples from the energy-based model and update the
model parameters with the maximum likelihood learning gradient, while the
normalizing flow directly learns from the synthesized examples by maximizing
the tractable likelihood. Under the short-run non-mixing MCMC scenario, the
estimation of the energy-based model is shown to follow the perturbation of
maximum likelihood, and the short-run Langevin flow and the normalizing flow
form a two-flow generator that we call CoopFlow. We provide an understating of
the CoopFlow algorithm by information geometry and show that it is a valid
generator as it converges to a moment matching estimator. We demonstrate that
the trained CoopFlow is capable of synthesizing realistic images,
reconstructing images, and interpolating between images.

create data representations that are actionable for transfer learning in the

learning, the projector is discarded since empirical results show that its

investigate this curious phenomenon and analyze how the strength of the data
augmentation policies affects the data embedding. We discover a non-trivial
relation between the encoder, the projector, and the data augmentation
strength: with increasingly larger augmentation policies, the projector, rather
than the encoder, is more strongly driven to become invariant to the
augmentations. It does so by eliminating crucial information about the data by
learning to project it into a low-dimensional space, a noisy estimate of the
data manifold tangent plane in the encoder representation. This analysis is
substantiated through a geometrical perspective with theoretical and empirical
results.

navigation applications. Nevertheless, localizing the perfect destination
within the last few meters remains an important but unresolved problem. Limited
by the GPS positioning accuracy, navigation systems always show users a
vicinity of a destination, but not its exact location. Street view images (SVI)
in maps as an immersive media technology have served as an aid to provide the
physical environment for human last-meters wayfinding. However, due to the
large diversity of geographic context and acquisition conditions, the captured
SVI always contains various distracting objects (e.g., pedestrians and
vehicles), which will distract human visual attention from efficiently finding
the destination in the last few meters. To address this problem, we highlight
the importance of reducing visual distraction in image-based wayfinding by
proposing a saliency-guided image inpainting framework. It aims at redirecting
human visual attention from distracting objects to destination-related objects
for more efficient and accurate wayfinding in the last meters. Specifically, a
context-aware distracting object detection method driven by deep salient object
detection has been designed to extract distracting objects from three semantic
levels in SVI. Then we employ a large-mask inpainting method with fast Fourier
convolutions to remove the detected distracting objects. Experimental results
with both qualitative and quantitative analysis show that our saliency-guided
inpainting method can not only achieve great perceptual quality in street view
images but also redirect the human's visual attention to focus more on static
location-related objects than distracting ones. The human-based evaluation also
justified the effectiveness of our method in improving the efficiency of

safety-critical domains such as medical, law, and transportation. In these
domains, high-stake decisions provided by machine learning necessitate
researchers to design interpretable models, where the prediction is
understandable to a human. In interpretable machine learning, rule-based
classifiers are particularly effective in representing the decision boundary
through a set of rules comprising input features. The interpretability of
rule-based classifiers is in general related to the size of the rules, where
smaller rules are considered more interpretable. To learn such a classifier,
the brute-force direct approach is to consider an optimization problem that
tries to learn the smallest classification rule that has close to maximum
accuracy. This optimization problem is computationally intractable due to its
combinatorial nature and thus, the problem is not scalable in large datasets.
To this end, in this paper we study the triangular relationship among the
accuracy, interpretability, and scalability of learning rule-based classifiers.
  The contribution of this paper is an interpretable learning framework IMLI,
that is based on maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) for synthesizing
classification rules expressible in proposition logic. Despite the progress of
MaxSAT solving in the last decade, the straightforward MaxSAT-based solution
cannot scale. Therefore, we incorporate an efficient incremental learning
technique inside the MaxSAT formulation by integrating mini-batch learning and
iterative rule-learning. In our experiments, IMLI achieves the best balance
among prediction accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. As an
application, we deploy IMLI in learning popular interpretable classifiers such
as decision lists and decision sets.

this work is to characterize the performance and cost of permissioned
blockchains on different hardware systems, which is important as diverse

performance evaluation of two permissioned blockchains, namely Hyperledger
Fabric and ConsenSys Quorum, on five different types of hardware covering both
x86/64 and ARM architecture, as well as, both cloud and edge computing. The
hardware nodes include servers with Intel Xeon CPU, servers with ARM-based
Amazon Graviton CPU, and edge devices with ARM-based CPU. Our results reveal a
diverse profile of the two blockchains across different settings, demonstrating
the impact of hardware choices on the overall performance and cost. We find
that Graviton servers outperform Xeon servers in many settings, due to their
powerful CPU and high memory bandwidth. Edge devices with ARM architecture, on
the other hand, exhibit low performance. When comparing the cloud with the
edge, we show that the cost of the latter is much smaller in the long run if

Owing to the strong mode overlap between the SOI nanowires and the GO films

hybrid waveguides is significantly enhanced, resulting in greatly improved
spectral broadening of the femtosecond optical pulses. A solution-based,
transfer-free coating method is used to integrate GO films onto the SOI
nanowires with precise control of the film thickness. Detailed SPM measurements
using femtosecond optical pulses are carried out, achieving a broadening factor
of up to ~4.3 for a device with 0.4-mm-long, 2 layers of GO. By fit-ting the
experimental results with theory, we obtain an improvement in the waveguide
nonlin-ear parameter by a factor of ~3.5 and the effective nonlinear figure of

this paper, we proposed an image denoising network structure based on
Transformer, which is named DenSformer. DenSformer consists of three modules,
including a preprocessing module, a local-global feature extraction module, and
a reconstruction module. Specifically, the local-global feature extraction
module consists of several Sformer groups, each of which has several
ETransformer layers and a convolution layer, together with a residual

of different layers, and they jointly capture the local and global information
from the given noisy images. We conduct our model on comprehensive experiments.
Experimental results prove that our DenSformer achieves improvement compared to

significant attention as a rapid version of physics-informed neural network
(PINN) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The key
characteristic is to fix the input layer weights with random values and use
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse for the output layer weights. The framework
is effective, but it easily suffers from overfitting noisy data and lacks
uncertainty quantification for the solution under noise scenarios.To this end,
we develop the Bayesian physics-informed extreme learning machine (BPIELM) to
solve both forward and inverse linear PDE problems with noisy data in a unified
framework. In our framework, a prior probability distribution is introduced in
the output layer for extreme learning machine with physic laws and the Bayesian
method is used to estimate the posterior of parameters. Besides, for inverse
PDE problems, problem parameters considered as new output layer weights are
unified in a framework with forward PDE problems. Finally, we demonstrate
BPIELM considering both forward problems, including Poisson, advection, and
diffusion equations, as well as inverse problems, where unknown problem
parameters are estimated. The results show that, compared with PIELM, BPIELM
quantifies uncertainty arising from noisy data and provides more accurate
predictions. In addition, BPIELM is considerably cheaper than PINN in terms of
the computational cost.

Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), coupled with the Modal Order Reduction (MOR)

Gaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the
existing method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of
path planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to
apply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel
risk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT
(NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by
perceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler
is proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the
recursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are
used to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed
bounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a
standby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution.
Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the

demonstrate that flat profiles are a manifestation of a bar's secular growth,
producing a 'shoulder' region (an overdensity above an exponential) in its
outskirts. Shoulders are not present when bars form, but develop as the bar
grows. If the bar does not grow, shoulders do not form. Shoulders are often
accompanied by box/peanut bulges, but develop separately from them and are
independent tracers of a bar's growth. They can be observed at a wide range of
viewing orientations with only their slope varying significantly with
inclination. We present evidence that shoulders are produced by looped x1
orbits. Since the growth rate of the bar moderately correlates with the growth
rate of the shoulder strength, these orbits are probably recently trapped.
Shoulders therefore are evidence of bar growth. The properties of the shoulders
do not, however, establish the age of a bar, because secondary buckling or
strong spirals may destroy shoulders, and also because shoulders do not form if
the bar does not grow much. In particular, our results show that an exponential

record data in the Partner Health System, we introduce a new data analysis
pipeline and a novel statistical methodology that address existing limitations
by (i) designing a rigorous causal framework that systematically examines the
causal effects of statin usage on T2D risk in observational data, (ii)
uncovering which patient subgroup is most vulnerable for developing T2D after
taking statins, and (iii) assessing the replicability and statistical
significance of the most vulnerable subgroup via a bootstrap calibration
procedure. Our proposed approach delivers asymptotically sharp confidence
intervals and debiased estimate for the treatment effect of the most vulnerable
subgroup in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. With our proposed
approach, we find that females with high T2D genetic risk are at the highest
risk of developing T2D due to statin usage.

encourages an ASR model to output similar predictions for the same input speech

utilizes SpecAugment as data augmentation and requires a static teacher model
to produce pseudo transcripts for untranscribed speech. However, this paradigm
fails to take full advantage of consistency regularization. First, the masking
operations of SpecAugment may damage the linguistic contents of the speech,
thus influencing the quality of pseudo labels. Second, S2S ASR requires both
input speech and prefix tokens to make the next prediction. The static prefix
tokens made by the offline teacher model cannot match dynamic pseudo labels
during consistency training. In this work, we propose an improved consistency
training paradigm of semi-supervised S2S ASR. We utilize speech chain
reconstruction as the weak augmentation to generate high-quality pseudo labels.
Moreover, we demonstrate that dynamic pseudo transcripts produced by the
student ASR model benefit the consistency training. Experiments on LJSpeech and

the Universe. Long GRB (LGRB) correspond to those events with a typical prompt
emission of more than a few seconds. It is generally assumed that they are
originated after an implosion of a very massive star within a central compact
object engine that can be either a black hole (BH) or a rapidly-spinning
highly-magnetized neutron star (NS). Nevertheless, one of the most challenging
aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially
hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of
thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an
alternative solution. We consider the characteristics of both progenitors and
the fireball scenario to calculate the oscillation probabilities within a
three-flavor admixture regime. Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and
we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected
in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of
previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our
findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an
additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these

random. Therefore, we study the asynchronous online learning strategy of the
players to adaptively adjust the next actions for minimizing the long-term
regret loss. The paper provides a novel no-regret learning algorithm, called
Online Gradient Descent with lossy bandits (OGD-lb). We first give the regret
analysis for concave games with differentiable and Lipschitz utilities. Then we
show that the action profile converges to a Nash equilibrium with probability 1
when the game is also strictly monotone. We further provide the mean square
convergence rate $\mathcal{O}\left(k^{-2\min\{\beta, 1/6\}}\right)$ when the
game is $\beta-$ strongly monotone. In addition, we extend the algorithm to the
case when the loss probability of the bandit feedback is unknown, and prove its
almost sure convergence to Nash equilibrium for strictly monotone games.

rate of droplets that sediment in homogeneous isotropic Navier-Stokes
turbulence. It is assumed that typical turbulent accelerations of fluid
particles are much smaller than gravity. This was shown to imply that the
particles interact weakly with individual vortices and, as a result, form a
smooth flow in most of the space. In weakly intermittent turbulence with
moderate Reynolds number, rare regions where the flow breaks down can be
neglected in the calculation of space averaged rate of droplet collisions.
However, increase of Re increases probability of rare, large quiescent vortices
whose long coherent interaction with the particles destroys the flow. Thus at
higher Re the space averaged collision rate forms in rare regions where the
assumption of smooth flow breaks down. We describe the transition between the
regimes and provide collision kernel in the case of moderate Re describable by
the flow. The distribution of pairwise distances is shown to obey a separable
dependence on the magnitude and the polar angle of the separation vector.
Magnitude dependence obeys a power-law with a negative exponent, manifesting
multifractality of the droplet's attractor. We provide the so far missing
numerical confirmation of a relation between this exponent and the Lyapunov
exponents and demonstrate that it holds beyond the theoretical range. The
angular dependence of the RDF exhibits a maximum at small angles quantifying
particle's formation of spatial columns. We derive the droplet's collision
kernel using that in the considered limit the gradients of droplet's flow are
Gaussian. We demonstrate that as Re increases the column's aspect ratio
decreases, eventually becoming one when the isotropy is restored. We propose
how the theory could be constructed at higher Re of clouds by using the example

(Pulsed-ODMR) is one of the ways to measure the temperature using NV centers.
However, Pulsed-ODMR requires careful calibration and strict time
synchronization to control the microwave pulse, which complicates its
applicability. Nonetheless, the continuous-wave optically detected magnetic
resonance (CW- ODMR) in NV centers is another more advantageous way to measure
temperature with NV centers, owing to its simple implementation by applying a
green laser and microwave in a continuous manner. This, however, has the
drawback of a lower sensitivity compared to pulsed-ODMR. Therefore, to benefit
from its accessible adaptation, it is highly important to improve the
sensitivity of temperature sensing with CW-ODMR. Here, we propose a novel
method to measure temperature using CW-ODMR with a quantum state dressed by
radio-frequency (RF) fields under transverse magnetic fields. RF fields are
expected to suppress inhomogeneous broadening owing to strain variations.
Experimental results confirmed that the linewidth becomes narrower in our

to search the Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative game such that each player
has no incentive to deviate from the equilibrium under its private objective.
Meanwhile, the agents can coordinate to optimize the social cost within the set
of Nash equilibria of the underlying game. Such an optimal Nash equilibrium
problem can be modeled as a distributed optimization problem with variational
inequality constraints. We consider the scenario where the objective functions
of both the underlying game and social cost optimization problem have a special
aggregation structure. Since each player only has access to its local
objectives while cannot know all players' decisions, a distributed algorithm is
highly desirable. By utilizing the Tikhonov regularization and dynamical
averaging tracking technique, we propose a distributed coordination algorithm
by introducing an incentive term in addition to the gradient-based Nash
equilibrium seeking, so as to intervene players' decisions to improve the
system efficiency. We prove its convergence to the optimal Nash equilibrium of
a monotone aggregative game with simulation studies.

allows the user to interact with the device by making simple static and dynamic
hand gestures. Each gesture triggers a different action in the system, such as
object recognition, scene description or image scaling (e.g., pointing a finger
at an object will show a description of it). The system is based on a
multi-head neural network architecture, which initially detects and classifies
the gestures, and subsequently, depending on the gesture detected, performs a
second stage that carries out the corresponding action. This multi-head
architecture optimizes the resources required to perform different tasks
simultaneously, and takes advantage of the information obtained from an initial
backbone to perform different processes in a second stage. To train and
evaluate the system, a dataset with about 40k images was manually compiled and
labeled including different types of hand gestures, backgrounds (indoors and
outdoors), lighting conditions, etc. This dataset contains synthetic gestures
(whose objective is to pre-train the system in order to improve the results)
and real images captured using different mobile phones. The results obtained
and the comparison made with the state of the art show competitive results as
regards the different actions performed by the system, such as the accuracy of
classification and localization of gestures, or the generation of descriptions
for objects and scenes.

very high resolution pattern with parasitic polarities along the inter-granular

photosphere. Magnetic cancellations between the opposite polarities are
observed in the vicinity of the footpoints of the jets. Along the
inter-granular lanes horizontal magnetic field around 1000 Gauss is generated
impulsively. Overall, all the kinetic features at the different layers through

Prior research shows that users can make quicker and more informed decisions

is difficult for users to efficiently grasp meaningful messages for making
decisions. To solve this problem, one practical strategy is to provide tips,

named MTips for the task and propose a framework named GENTMS for automatically

its outstanding performance, it is being used in a variety of security and
privacy-sensitive areas in addition to conventional applications. One of the
key aspects of deep learning efficacy is to have abundant data. This trait
leads to the usage of data which can be highly sensitive and private, which in
turn causes wariness with regard to deep learning in the general public.
Membership inference attacks are considered lethal as they can be used to
figure out whether a piece of data belongs to the training dataset or not. This
can be problematic with regards to leakage of training data information and its
characteristics. To highlight the significance of these types of attacks, we
propose an enhanced methodology for membership inference attacks based on
adversarial robustness, by adjusting the directions of adversarial
perturbations through label smoothing under a white-box setting. We evaluate
our proposed method on three datasets: Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
Our experimental results reveal that the performance of our method surpasses
that of the existing adversarial robustness-based method when attacking
normally trained models. Additionally, through comparing our technique with the
state-of-the-art metric-based membership inference methods, our proposed method
also shows better performance when attacking adversarially trained models. The

of research for alleviating the huge cost associated with the construction of
reliable large-scale annotations in the medical domain. Recent semi-supervised
approaches have demonstrated promising results by employing consistency
regularization, pseudo-labeling techniques, and adversarial learning. These
methods primarily attempt to learn the distribution of labeled and unlabeled
data by enforcing consistency in the predictions or embedding context. However,
previous approaches have focused only on local discrepancy minimization or
context relations across single classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel
adversarial learning-based semi-supervised segmentation method that effectively
embeds both local and global features from multiple hidden layers and learns
context relations between multiple classes. Our voxel-wise adversarial learning
method utilizes a voxel-wise feature discriminator, which considers multilayer
voxel-wise features (involving both local and global features) as an input by
embedding class-specific voxel-wise feature distribution. Furthermore, we
improve our previous representation learning method by overcoming information
loss and learning stability problems, which enables rich representations of
labeled data. Our method outperforms current best-performing state-of-the-art
semi-supervised learning approaches on the image segmentation of the left
atrium (single class) and multiorgan datasets (multiclass). Moreover, our
visual interpretation of the feature space demonstrates that our proposed
method enables a well-distributed and separated feature space from both labeled

better by a factor of 5 with ${\sigma_{H_0}} / {H_0}\lesssim 0.043\%$. Such a

literature. Here, we propose a design principle for ferroelectric-like
elemental polar metals and relate it to real materials. The design principle is
that, to be an elemental polar metal, atoms should occupy at least two
inequivalent Wyckoff positions in a crystal with a polar space group, where
inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken. According to this rule, we propose
the first class of potential ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals in a
distorted {\alpha}-La-like structure with a polar space group P63mc in which
two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, z) and 2b (1/3, 2/3, z) are
occupied by group-V elements (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth).
Analyses based on first-principles calculations indicate that the dynamically
stable polar phase results from a lone pair driven polar distortion of the
nonploar phase in P63/mmc symmetry where two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a
(0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) are occupied. This ferroelectric-like
transition involves a transition from a metallic state to a semimetallic state.
These predicted polar phases are metastable with respect to their corresponding
ground phases. Moreover, ionic bonding characters are found due to the
inequivalence in Wyckoff positions between group-V atoms. Our work opens a
route to single-element parity-breaking phases.

of the actively scanned proton and carbon ion beams at the Italian National
Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy. Methods: The laterally integrated
depth-dose-distributions (IDDs) were acquired with the PTW Peakfinder, a
variable depth water column, equipped with two Bragg peak ionization chambers.
FLUKA MC code was used to generate the energy libraries, the IDDs in water, and
the fragment spectra for carbon beams. EBT3 films were used for spot size
measurements, beam position over the scan field, and homogeneity in 2D-fields.
Beam monitor calibration was performed in terms of number of particles per MU
using both a Farmer-type and an Advanced Markus ionization chamber. The beam
position at the isocenter, beam monitor calibration curve, dose constancy in
the center of the spread-out-Bragg-peak, dose homogeneity in 2D-fields, beam
energy, spot size, and spot position over the scan field are all checked on a
daily basis for both protons and carbon ions and on all beam lines. Results:
The simulated IDDs showed an excellent agreement with the measured experimental
curves. The measured FWHM of the pencil beam in air at the isocenter was from
0.7 to 2.2 cm for protons. For carbon ions, two sets of spot size are
available: from 0.4 to 0.8 cm (for the smaller) and from 0.8 to 1.1 cm (for the
larger one). The spot position was within +/-1 mm over the whole 20x20 cm2 scan
field; homogeneity in a uniform squared field was within +/-5% for both
particle types at any energy. QA results exceeding tolerance levels were rarely
found. In the reporting period, the machine downtime was around 6%, of which
4.5% was due to planned maintenance shutdowns. Conclusions: After successful
dosimetric beam commissioning, quality assurance measurements performed during
a 24-month period show very stable beam characteristics.

trade-off bias-variance of the estimation error by tuning parameter $\gamma >

$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ as the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) based methods but
achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/(\gamma+1))$ smaller variance. Then, a stable
observer gain design procedure based on the estimations is proposed. The
observation performance bound based on the estimations is evaluated by the mean
square observation error, which is shown to be adjustable by tuning the
parameter $\gamma$, thus achieving higher scalability than the OLS methods. The
advantages of the estimation error bias-variance trade-off for observer design
are also demonstrated through matrix spectrum and observation performance
optimality analysis. Extensive simulation validations are conducted to verify
the computed estimation error and performance optimality with different

grains. Although spacecraft and space telescope observations have revealed
various detailed features of the spokes and their time variation, their
formation mechanism is still under debate. Previous models examined charging
mechanisms to attempt at explaining dust release from cm-sized ring particles;
however, the attempt has been unsuccessful, because the electrostatic force
caused by such charging mechanisms is much weaker than the cohesive force
acting on dust grains at ordinary conditions in the ring environment. Here we
propose a novel model for the formation of the spokes, where the temperature
dependence of cohesion plays an essential role. Ring particles with a
temperature below 60K adsorb an O2 ring atmosphere, which facilitates release
of dust grains from them by a reduction in the cohesive force between the
grains and the particles on the morning ansa. Then, intense electrostatic
forces sufficient to overcome the cohesive force are generated on the surface
of ring particles and the released dust grains form the structure of spokes.
Our model explains observational features of the spokes including their
longitudinal location, lifetime, radial expansion velocity, and seasonality.

Prominently, the mutual information rate of a signal and its Poisson channel
output is a difference functional between the CI and the intensity that has
full knowledge about the input. While the CI of Markov-modulated Poisson
processes evolves according to Snyder's filter, self-exciting processes, e.g.,
Hawkes processes, specify the CI via the history of $Y_t$. The emergence of the
CI as a self-contained stochastic process prompts us to bring its statistical
ensemble into focus. We investigate the asymptotic conditional intensity
distribution (ACID) and emphasize its rich information content. We assume the
case in which the CI is determined from a sufficient statistic that progresses
as a Markov process. We present a simulation-free method to compute the ACID

possible by introducing a backward recurrence time parametrization, which has
the advantage to align all probability inflow in a boundary condition for the
master equation. Case studies illustrate the usage of ACID for three primary
examples: 1) the Poisson channels with binary Markovian input (as an example of
a Markov-modulated Poisson process), 2) the standard Hawkes process with
exponential kernel (as an example of a self-exciting counting process) and 3)

anomalous Hall insulator (VQAHI), HVM and FVS. These imply twice topological
phase transitions, which are related with sign-reversible Berry curvature and
band inversion between $d_{xy}$+$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals for K or

strength between valence and conduction bands. However, for in-plane magnetic

polarization exist within the considered strain range. The actual magnetic
anisotropy energy (MAE) shows no special QAH and HVM states in monolayer

phase; therefore, it is important to ensure an appropriate analysis method for
these models. A key concept for such analysis is the development of a
diagramming technique (e.g., UML) because diagrams can describe entities and
processes and emphasize important aspects of the systems being described. The
analysis also includes an examination of ontological concepts such as states
and events, which are used as a basis for the modeling process. Studying
fundamental concepts allows us to understand more deeply the relationship
between these concepts and modeling frameworks. In this paper, we critically
analyze the classic definition of a state utilizing the thinging machine (TM)
model. States in state machine diagrams are considered the appropriate basis
for modeling system behavioral aspects. Despite its wide application in
hardware design, the integration of a state machine model into a software
system s modeling requirements increased the difficulty of graphical
representation (e.g., integration between structural and behavioral diagrams).
To understand such a problem, in this paper, we project (create an equivalent
representation of) states in TM machines. As a case study, we re-modeled a
state machine of an assembly line system in a TM. The outcome is a complicated
picture of assembly line behavior. Therefore, as an alternative solution, we
re-modeled the assembly line based solely on the TM. This new model presents a
clear contrast between state-based modeling of assembly line behavior and the
TM approach. The TM modeling seems more systematic than its counterpart, the

SP-STM data reveal small-sized magnetic domains at lower annealing
temperatures, evidently caused by pinning at grain boundaries and other
crystalline defects. The coverage-dependent magnetic domain structure of
optimally prepared Gd films was systematically investigated. For low coverage
up to about 80 atomic layers (AL) we observe $\mu$m-sized domains separated by
domain walls which are oriented approximately along the $[1{\bar 1}0]$
direction of the underlying W substrate. Above a critical film thicknesses
$\Theta_{\text{crit}} \approx (100 \pm 20)$\,AL, we identify stripe domains,
indicative for a spin reorientation transition from in-plane to out-of-plane.
In agreement with existing models, the periodicity of the stripe domains
increases the further the coverage exceeds $\Theta_{\text{crit}}$. While the
orientation of the stripe domains is homogeneous over large distances just
above $\Theta_{\text{crit}}$, we find a characteristic zig-zag pattern at
$\Theta \gtrsim 200$\,AL and irregular stripe domains beyond 500\,AL.
Intermediate minima and maxima of the magnetic signal indicate the nucleation
of branching domains. The results are discussed in terms of various

electrons from Geminga can induce $\gamma$ rays via inverse Compton scattering,
we take into account the extended $\gamma$-ray observations around Geminga from
HAWC for $\sim 10$ TeV and from Fermi-LAT for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV. According
to the extended $\gamma$-ray observation claimed by an analysis of Fermi-LAT

energy conversion efficiency into positrons and electrons. However, based on
the constraint on the extended $\gamma$ rays given by another Fermi-LAT

positron excess. A further robust analysis of Fermi-LAT data for the extended
$\gamma$ rays would be crucial to determine whether Geminga can explain the

So
the quick detection of fake news has become an important task. Some current
detection methods often model news articles and other related components as a
static heterogeneous information network (HIN) and use expensive
message-passing algorithms. However, in the real-world, quickly identifying
fake news is of great significance and the network may vary over time in terms
of dynamic nodes and edges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DHGNN) for fake news quick
detection. More specifically, we first implement BERT and fine-tuned BERT to
get a semantic representation of the news article contents and author profiles
and convert it into graph data. Then, we construct the heterogeneous
news-author graph to reflect contextual information and relationships.
Additionally, we adapt ideas from personalized PageRank propagation and dynamic
propagation to heterogeneous networks in order to reduce the time complexity of
back-propagating through many nodes during training. Experiments on three
real-world fake news datasets show that DHGNN can outperform other GNN-based
models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

it exhibits a hemispheric-scale network of extensional tectonic faults
superposed on the moon's cratered surface. The faults likely reflect past
endogenic activity and Dione's interior thermal history. Although fresh
exposures of pristine scarps indicate that the timing of the faulting is
relatively recent, the absolute age of the faulting remains uncertain. To
estimate the timing of the faulting, we investigated stratigraphic
relationships between impact craters and faults. Using high-resolution images
obtained by ISS cameras onboard the Cassini spacecraft, we investigated craters
with diameters exceeding or equal to 10 km that coincide spatially with the
faults, and classified the craters as crosscut craters or superposed craters.
As a result, at least 82% of the craters were interpreted as clear examples of
crosscut craters and 12% of the craters were interpreted to be candidates of
superposed craters, although stratigraphic relationships are often ambiguous.
The paucity of superposed craters and a predicted cratering rate indicate that
the faulting of the Wispy Terrain is 0.30-0.79 Ga. If 12-18% of the craters are
assumed to be superposed, the timing of the faulting could be in the range
0.30-0.79 Ga. However, it is possible that the faulting of the Wispy Terrain is
still ongoing.

To enable radial velocity (RV) precision on the order of ~0.1 m/s
required for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting solar-type stars,
the main obstacle lies in mitigating the impact of stellar activity. Aims. This
study investigates the dependence of derived RVs with respect to the formation
temperature of spectral line segments. Methods. Using spectral synthesis, we
compute for each observed wavelength point of unblended spectral lines the
stellar temperature below which 50% of the emergent flux originates. We can
then construct RV time series for different temperature ranges, using template
matching. Results. With HARPS-N solar data and HARPS $\alpha$ Cen B
measurements, we demonstrate on time intervals of prominent stellar activity
that the activity-induced RV signal has different amplitude and periodicity
depending on the temperature range considered. We compare the solar
measurements with simulated contributions from active surface regions seen in
simultaneous images, and find that the suppression of convective motion is the
dominant effect. Conclusions. From a carefully selected set of spectral lines,
we are able to measure the RV impact of stellar activity at various stellar
temperatures ranges. We are able to strongly correlate the effect of convective
suppression with spectral line segments formed in hotter temperature ranges. At
cooler temperatures, the derived RVs exhibit oppositely directed variations
compared to the average RV time series and stronger anti-correlations with
chromospheric emission.

self-gravitationally bound cores (MBCs) in high-speed cloud-cloud collisions
(CCCs). Extending our previous work (Sakre et al. 2021), we perform
magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the high-speed (20 - 40 km s$^{-1}$)
collisions between two magnetized (4 $\mu$G initially), turbulent clouds of
different sizes in the range of 7 - 20 pc. We show that a magnetic field effect
hinders the core growth, particularly after a short-duration collision during
which cores cannot get highly bound. In such a case, a shocked region created
by the collision rapidly expands to the ambient medium owing to the enhanced
magnetic pressure, resulting in the destruction of the highly unbound cores and
suppression of gas accretion to massive cores. This negative effect on the MBC
formation is a phenomenon not seen in the past hydrodynamic simulations of
similar CCC models. Together with our previous work, we conclude that the
magnetic fields provide the two competing effects on the MBC formation in CCC;
while they promote the mass accumulation into cores during a collision, they
operate to destroy cores or hinder the core growth after the collision. The
duration of collision determines which effect prevails, providing the maximum
collision speed for the MBC formation with given colliding clouds. Our results
agree with the observed trend among CCC samples in the corresponding column
density range; clouds with higher relative velocity require higher column
density for the formation of massive stars (Enokiya et al. 2021).

achieves this speed by relying on a sparse voxel octree, careful voxel sampling

as well as ground truth depth maps at training time. Our dataset is generated
by NViSII, a Python-based ray tracing renderer, which is designed to be simple

predict the behavior of the robot as it interacts with the environment. For
example, to grasp small objects on a table, the teleoperator needs to predict
the position of the fingertips before the fingers are closed to avoid them
hitting the table. For that reason, we developed the F1 hand, a single-motor
gripper that facilitates teleoperation with the use of a fixed finger. The hand
is capable of grasping objects as thin as a paper clip, and as heavy and large
as a cordless drill. The applicability of the hand can be expanded by replacing
the fixed finger with different shapes. This flexibility makes the hand highly
versatile while being easy and cheap to develop. However, due to the atypical
asymmetric structure and actuation of the hand usual grasping strategies no
longer apply. Thus, we propose a controller that approximates actuation
symmetry by using the motion of the whole arm. The F1 hand and its controller
are compared side-by-side with the original Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR)
gripper in teleoperation using 22 objects from the YCB dataset in addition to
small objects. The grasping time and peak contact forces could be decreased by
20% and 70%, respectively while increasing success rates by 5%. Using an
off-the-shelf grasp pose estimator for autonomous grasping, the system achieved
similar success rates to the original HSR gripper, at the order of 80%.

consequence, the system decomposes into superconducting droplets with the
typical size of the coherence length. We show that the two possible phases of
the system match the two known mechanisms by which (2+1)-dimensional QED cures
its infrared divergences, either by generating a mixed topological Chern-Simons
mass or by magnetic monopole instantons. The former is realized in
superconductors, the latter governs mirror-dual superinsulators. Planar

be factored as (i) inferring specific goal predicates that characterize the
task implied by a language instruction for a given world state and (ii)
synthesizing a feasible goal-reaching action-sequence with such predicates. For
the former, we leverage a neural network prediction model, while utilizing a
symbolic planner for the latter. We introduce a novel neuro-symbolic model,
GoalNet, for contextual and task dependent inference of goal predicates from
human demonstrations and linguistic task descriptions. GoalNet combines (i)
learning, where dense representations are acquired for language instruction and
the world state that enables generalization to novel settings and (ii)
planning, where the cause-effect modeling by the symbolic planner eschews
irrelevant predicates facilitating multi-stage decision making in large

we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system by providing multiple

longitudinal tracking. It takes only a few seconds to capture the entire skin
surface, and about half an hour to process and analyse the images. Our
experiments show that the proposed system allow fast and easy whole body 3D
imaging. It can be used by dermatological clinics to conduct skin screening,
detect and track skin lesions over time, identify suspicious lesions, and
document pigmented lesions. The system can potentially save clinicians time and

imbalanced data due to the majority of frames not including a speaker change.
Conventional training methods tackle these by artificially increasing the
proportion of positive labels in the training data. Instead, the proposed
method uses an objective function which encourages the model to predict a
single positive label within a specified collar. This is done by marginalizing
over all possible subsequences that have exactly one positive label within the
collar. Experiments on English and Estonian datasets show large improvements
over the conventional training method. Additionally, the model outputs have
peaks concentrated to a single frame, removing the need for post-processing to
find the exact predicted change point which is particularly useful for

potential associate factors, as suggested in preclinical studies. However,
epidemiological studies are scarce which investigated the association between
NLR, and insulin resistance (IR) and they included only diabetes mellitus
patients, not the general population. This study aims to determine if there is
a direct correlation between NLR and IR in the US general population. Methods:
The sample consists of 3,307 from general population, provided by National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Homeostasis Model Assessment
of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) value was calculated to evaluate insulin
resistance. We investigated the relationship between their NLR and HOMA-IR
values by bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. As insulin use
could results in inaccurate HOMA-IR estimation, we excluded them and ran the
analyses in subgroup analyses. Results: There was a relationship shown when
insulin users were included, having a beta coefficient value of 0.010 (95%
confidence interval [CI] of 0.003-0.017). However, when insulin users were
excluded, the beta value decreased to 0.004 (95% CI of -0.006-0.015). The
statistical significance was not reached when age, sex, and body mass index
were adjusted for in the multivariate analyses. Conclusion: There is no visible
relationship between IR and NLR in the general population. IR might not explain

each of 14 non-condensing boilers. The collected data is used for training and
testing fault classification using K-nearest neighbour, Decision tree, Random
Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The results show that the Support Vector
Machines method gave the best prediction accuracy, consistently exceeding 90%,
and generalization across multiple boilers is not possible due to low
classification accuracy.

large timesteps compared to particle gyro-period under a uniform external
magnetic field. The algorithm extends earlier electrostatic fully implicit PIC
implementations with a new asymptotic-preserving particle-push scheme that
allows timesteps much larger than particle gyroperiods. In the large-timestep
limit, the integrator preserves all particle drifts, while recovering the full
orbit for small timesteps. The scheme allows for a seamless, efficient
treatment of particles with coexisting magnetized and unmagnetized species, and
conserves energy and charge exactly without spoiling implicit solver
performance. We demonstrate by numerical experiment with several problems of
variable species magnetization (diocotron instability, modified two-stream
instability, and drift instability) that orders of magnitude wall-clock-time
speedups vs. the standard fully implicit electrostatic PIC algorithm are
possible without sacrificing solution accuracy.

  based on nonlocal mean denoising",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to improve the transmission effect of low-power communication signal
of Internet of things and compress the enhancement time of low-power
communication signal, this paper designs a low-power communication signal
enhancement method of Internet of things based on nonlocal mean denoising.
Firstly, the residual of one-dimensional communication layer is pre processed
by convolution core to obtain the residual of one-dimensional communication
layer; Then, according to the two classification recognition method, the noise
reduction signal feature recognition of the low-power communication signal of
the Internet of things is realized, the non local mean noise reduction
algorithm is used to remove the low-power communication signal of the Internet
of things, and the weight value between similar blocks is calculated according
to the European distance method. Finally, the low-power communication signal
enhancement of the Internet of things is realized by the non local mean value
denoising method. The experimental results show that the communication signal
enhancement time overhead of this method is low, which is always less than
2.6s. The lowest bit error rate after signal enhancement is about 1%, and the
signal-to-noise ratio is up to 18 dB, which shows that this method can achieve
signal enhancement.

  Detection","9 Pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face Recognition (FR) systems are being used in a variety of applications,
including road crossings, banking, and mobile banking. The widespread use of FR
systems has raised concerns about the safety of face biometrics against
spoofing attacks, which use the use of a photo or video of a legitimate user's
face to gain illegal access to the resources or activities. Despite the
development of several FAS or liveness detection methods (which determine
whether a face is live or spoofed at the time of acquisition), the problem
remains unsolved due to the difficulty of identifying discrimination and
operationally reasonably priced spoof characteristics but also approaches.
Additionally, certain facial portions are frequently repeated or correlate to
image clutter, resulting in poor performance overall. This research proposes a
face-anti-spoofing neural network model that outperforms existing models and
has an efficiency of 0.89 percent.

light is used to image the plasma channel in a tenuous vapor and machine
learning techniques are tested for extracting quantitative information from the

extract from the Schlieren images reliably and with high accuracy the location,
the radius and the maximum ionization fraction of the plasma channel as well as
the width of the transition region between the core of the plasma channel and
the unionized vapor. We test several different neural network architectures
with supervised learning and show that the parameter estimations supplied by
the networks are resilient with respect to slight changes of the experimental
parameters that may occur in the course of a measurement.

  arrow",,,"10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L022052",,"physics.gen-ph hep-ph hep-th quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is well-known that the 4-rotation in the 4-dimensional space-time is
equivalent to the CPT-transformation (C is the charge conjugation, P is the
space inversion and T is the time-reversal). The standard definition of the
T-reversal includes the change of the sign of time variable and replacement of
the initial state of the particle (system of particles) by the final state and
vice versa. Since the time-reversal operation changes the state of a particle,
the particle's wave function cannot be the eigenfunction of the corresponding
operator with a certain eigenvalue, as in the case of space parity. Unlike the
CPT-transformation, the separate P, T, or C transformations cannot be reduced
to any 4-rotation. The extended Lorentz group incorporates all the separate C,
P, or T transformations which do not bring the time axis out of the
corresponding light cone. The latter restriction is included in the standard
definition of the time-reversal. In the present communication, we ignore this
restriction.
  This allows to introduce the ""time arrow"" operator and characterize every
particle by the new quantum number - ""time arrow"" value. The wave functions of
all particles are eigenfunctions of this operator with eigenvalues equal to
""time arrow"" values. The particles with the ""time arrow"" values opposite to the
""time arrow"" value in our universe form another universe (anti-universe). The
existence of anti-universe can be confirmed, in principle, by laboratory
(atomic) experiments. The anti-universe may be also considered as a candidate
to the role of dark matter.

analyzing fairness issues in automatic algorithmic decisions. Section 1 shows
that technical choices in supervised learning have social implications that
need to be considered. Section 2 proposes a contextual approach to the issue of
unintended group discrimination, i.e. decision rules that are facially neutral
but generate disproportionate impacts across social groups (e.g., gender, race
or ethnicity). The contextualization will focus on the legal systems of the
United States on the one hand and Europe on the other. In particular,
legislation and case law tend to promote different standards of fairness on
both sides of the Atlantic. Section 3 is devoted to the explainability of
algorithmic decisions; it will confront and attempt to cross-reference legal
concepts (in European and French law) with technical concepts and will
highlight the plurality, even polysemy, of European and French legal texts
relating to the explicability of algorithmic decisions. The conclusion proposes
directions for further research.
