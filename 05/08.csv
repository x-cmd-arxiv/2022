Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity. These amplitudes have long been conjectured
to be interpreted as an anomaly and are recently linked to the UV divergence of
two-loop quantum gravity. In the first part of the thesis, we study the loop
amplitudes in self-dual Yang-Mills. We show that the four point one-loop
amplitude can be reduced to a computation of shifts, which strongly suggests a
case for an anomaly interpretation. We next propose a new formula for the
one-loop amplitudes at all multiplicity, in terms of the Berends-Giele currents
connected by an effective propagator. We prove the formula by observing that it
readily implies the correct collinear properties. To demonstrate the validity
of our formula, we do an explicit computation at 3, 4 and 5 points and
reproduce the known results. The region momenta variables play an important
role in our formula and thus it points to both the worldsheet and the momentum
twistor interpretations. In the second part of the thesis, we study the one

emotion and then reply with an appropriate emotion. However, current approaches
to this task either focus on improving the understanding of users' emotion or
on proposing better responding strategies, and very few works consider both at
the same time. Our work attempts to fill this vacancy. Inspired by
task-oriented dialogue systems, we propose a novel empathetic response
generation model with emotion-aware dialogue management. The emotion-aware
dialogue management contains two parts: (1) Emotion state tracking maintains
the current emotion state of the user and (2) Empathetic dialogue policy
selection predicts a target emotion and a user's intent based on the results of
the emotion state tracking. The predicted information is then used to guide the
generation of responses. Experimental results show that dynamically managing
different information can help the model generate more empathetic responses
compared with several baselines under both automatic and human evaluations.

the intrinsic hole doping, the topological states reside above the Fermi level,

inference approach which mainly incorporates the observation data in a
point-wise manner, i.e. we invert a limited number of observation data
leveraging the gradient information of the forward map with respect to
parameters, and find true individual samples of the latent parameters when the
forward map is noise-free and one-to-one. For statistical calculations (as the
ultimate goal in simulations), a large number of samples are generated from a
trained neural network which serves as a transport map from the prior to
posterior latent parameters. Our neural network machinery, developed as part of
the inference framework and referred to as Neural Net Kernels (NNK), is based
on hierarchical (deep) kernels which provide greater flexibility for training
compared to standard neural networks. We showcase the effectiveness of our

problem with many practical implications. Some recent works show that, in
low-light conditions, object detectors using raw image data are more robust
than detectors using image data processed by a traditional ISP pipeline. To
improve detection performance in low-light conditions, one can fine-tune the
detector to use raw image data or use a dedicated low-light neural pipeline
trained with paired low- and normal-light data to restore and enhance the
image. However, different camera sensors have different spectral sensitivity
and learning-based models using raw images process data in the sensor-specific
color space. Thus, once trained, they do not guarantee generalization to other
camera sensors. We propose to improve generalization to unseen camera sensors
by implementing a minimal neural ISP pipeline for machine cognition, named
GenISP, that explicitly incorporates Color Space Transformation to a
device-independent color space. We also propose a two-stage color processing
implemented by two image-to-parameter modules that take down-sized image as

train our proposed GenISP under the guidance of a pre-trained object detector
and avoid making assumptions about perceptual quality of the image, but rather
optimize the image representation for machine cognition. At the inference
stage, GenISP can be paired with any object detector. We perform extensive
experiments to compare our method to other low-light image restoration and
enhancement methods in an extrinsic task-based evaluation and validate that
GenISP can generalize to unseen sensors and object detectors. Finally, we
contribute a low-light dataset of 7K raw images annotated with 46K bounding

uncertainty in setting the renormalization scale. If in principle, the entire
perturbative series is void of this issue, in practice the perturbative
corrections are known up to a certain order of accuracy and scale invariance is
only approximated leading to the so-called scheme and scale ambiguities.
According to the conventional scale setting (CSS) this problem cannot be
avoided and the renormalization scale is set to the typical scale of a process
$Q$, and errors are estimated by varying the scale over a range of two
$[Q/2;2Q]$. This method is not void of ambiguities and leads to predictions
affected by large theoretical errors. Other strategies for the optimization of
the truncated expansion, such as the Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) and
the Fastest Apparent Convergence (FAC) criterion, have the same difficulties of
CSS and lead to incorrect and unphysical results. In general a scale-setting
procedure is considered reliable if it preserves important self-consistency
requirements such as all the renormalization group properties. Other
requirements are suggested by known tested theories, by the convergence
behavior of the series or by phenomenological results and scheme independence.
All theoretical requirements for a reliable scale-setting procedure can be
satisfied at once, leading to accurate results by using the Principle of
Maximum Conformality (PMC). This method generalizes the
Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) method to all orders and to all observables and
in the perspective of a theory unifying all interactions, such as the grand
unified theory (GUT), the PMC offers the possibility to apply the same method

certificates due to the complexities of mapping task-space obstacles through

generating such regions and certificates through convex optimization. Our
method, called C-Iris (C-space Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite
programming), generates large, convex polytopes in a rational parametrization
of the configuration space which are guaranteed to be collision-free. Such
regions have been shown to be useful for both optimization-based and randomized
motion planning. Our regions are generated by alternating between two convex
optimization problems: (1) a simultaneous search for a maximal-volume ellipse
inscribed in a given polytope and a certificate that the polytope is
collision-free and (2) a maximal expansion of the polytope away from the
ellipse which does not violate the certificate. The volume of the ellipse and
size of the polytope are allowed to grow over several iterations while being
collision-free by construction. Our method works in arbitrary dimensions, only
makes assumptions about the convexity of the obstacles in the task space, and
scales to realistic problems in manipulation. We demonstrate our algorithm's
ability to fill a non-trivial amount of collision-free C-space in a 3-DOF

  Acute Kidney Injury",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical syndrome characterized by a
sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage within a few hours or a few
days. Accurate early prediction of AKI for patients in ICU who are more likely
than others to have AKI can enable timely interventions, and reduce the
complications of AKI. Much of the clinical information relevant to AKI is
captured in clinical notes that are largely unstructured text and requires
advanced natural language processing (NLP) for useful information extraction.
On the other hand, pre-trained contextual language models such as Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have improved performances for
many NLP tasks in general domain recently. However, few have explored BERT on
disease-specific medical domain tasks such as AKI early prediction. In this
paper, we try to apply BERT to specific diseases and present an AKI
domain-specific pre-trained language model based on BERT (AKI-BERT) that could
be used to mine the clinical notes for early prediction of AKI. AKI-BERT is a
BERT model pre-trained on the clinical notes of patients having risks for AKI.
Our experiments on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III)
dataset demonstrate that AKI-BERT can yield performance improvements for early
AKI prediction, thus expanding the utility of the BERT model from general
clinical domain to disease-specific domain.

that deterministic mathematical epidemiology has one basic general law, the R0
alternative"" of [52, 51], which states that the local stability condition of
the disease free equilibrium may be expressed as R0 < 1, where R0 is the famous
basic reproduction number, which plays also a major role in the theory of
branching processes. The literature suggests that it is impossible to find
general laws concerning the endemic points. However, it is quite common that
  1. When R0 > 1, there exists a unique fixed endemic point, and
  2. the endemic point is locally stable when R0 > 1.
  One would like to establish these properties for a large class of realistic
epidemic models (and we do not include here epidemics without casualties). We
have introduced in [7, 5] a ""simple"", but broad class of ""SIR-PH models"" with
varying population, with the express purpose of establishing for these
processes the two properties above. Since that seemed still hard, we have
introduced a further class of ""SIR-PH-FA"" models, which may be interpreted as
approximations for the SIR-PH models, and which includes simpler models
typically studied in the literature (with constant population, without loss of
immunity, etc). The goal of our paper is to draw attention to the two open
problems above, for the SIR-PH, SIR-PH-FA, and also for a second, more refined
""intermediate approximation"" SIR-PH-IA. We illustrate the current status-quo by
presenting new results on a generalization of the SAIRS epidemic model of [44,

retracts to meet the immobile tail. At the nanoscale, interesting situations
arise with the peeling of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) on gold, as realized,
e.g., by atomic force microscopy. The nanosized system shows a constant-force
steady peeling regime, where the tip lifting h produces no retraction of the
ribbon detachment point, and just an advancement h of the free tail end. This
is opposite to the classic case, where the detachment point retracts and the
tail end stands still. Here we characterise, by analytical modeling and
numerical simulations, a third, experimentally relevant, setup where the
nanoribbon, albeit structurally lubric, does not have a freely moving tail end,
which is instead elastically tethered. Surprisingly, novel nontrivial scaling
exponents appear that regulate the peeling evolution. As the detachment front
retracts and the tethered tail is stretched, power laws of h characterize the
shrinking of the adhered length the growth of peeling force and the peeling
angle. These exponents precede the final total detachment as a critical point,
where the entire ribbon eventually hangs suspended between the tip and
tethering spring. These analytical predictions are confirmed by realistic MD
simulations, retaining the full atomistic description, also confirming their
survival at finite experimental temperatures.

suspensions as the swim speed increases. When the probe speed is fast, the
suspension activity is obscured by the rapid advection of the probe and the
measured microviscosity is indistinguishable from that of passive suspensions.
Generally for finite activity, the suspension exhibits a velocity-thinning
behavior -- though with a zero-velocity plateau lower than passive suspensions
-- as a function of the probe speed. These behaviors originate from the
interplay between the suspension activity and the hard-sphere excluded-volume
interaction between the probe and a bath particle.

capturing sensors for various applications. The reason for this success can be
found in many aspects: the high maneuverability of the UAVs, the capability of

that aims at increasing the automation, efficiency and reliability of the data

3D reconstruction using the data captured by UAVs is also attracting attention

model-free and model-based algorithms for viewpoint and path planning for 3D
reconstruction of large-scale objects. The analyzed approaches are limited to
those that employ a single-UAV as a data capturing platform for outdoor 3D

stars through the triple alpha process. The $0^+$ energy level of the carbon
nucleus allows for resonant nuclear reactions, which act to greatly increase
the carbon yields compared to the non-resonant case. Many authors have argued
that small changes to the energy level of this resonance would lead to a
significantly lower carbon abundance in the universe, and this sensitivity is
often considered an example of fine-tuning. By considering spallation reactions
occuring during the process of planet formation, this paper presents a partial
solution to this triple alpha fine-tuning problem. Young stellar objects
generate substantial luminosities of particle radiation (cosmic rays) that can
drive nuclear reactions through spallation. If the standard triple alpha
process is inoperative, stars tend to synthesize oxygen (and other alpha
elements) rather than carbon. Cosmic rays can interact with oxygen nuclei to
produce carbon while planets are forming. The resulting carbon abundances are
significant, but much smaller than those observed in our universe. However, for
a range of conditions -- as delineated herein -- spallation reactions can
result in carbon-to-oxygen ratios roughly comparable to those found on Earth
and thereby obviate the triple alpha fine-tuning problem.

given graph is NP-hard. This problem is closely related to the problem of
finding the smallest Odd Cycle Transversal.
  In this work, we consider the following model of instances: starting with a
set of vertices $V$, a set $S \subseteq V$ of $k$ vertices is chosen and an
arbitrary $d$-regular bipartite graph is added on it; edges between pairs of
vertices in $S \times (V \setminus S)$ and $(V \setminus S) \times (V \setminus
S)$ are added with probability $p$. Since for $d=0$, the problem reduces to
recovering a planted independent set, we don't expect efficient algorithms for
$k=o(\sqrt{n})$. This problem is a generalization of the planted balanced
biclique problem where the bipartite graph induced on $S$ is a complete
bipartite graph; [Lev18] gave an algorithm for recovering $S$ in this problem
when $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$.
  Our main result is an efficient algorithm that recovers (w.h.p.) the planted
bipartite graph when $k=\Omega_p(\sqrt{n \log n})$ for a large range of
parameters. Our results also hold for a natural semi-random model of instances,
which involve the presence of a monotone adversary. Our proof shows that a
natural SDP relaxation for the problem is integral by constructing an
appropriate solution to it's dual formulation. Our main technical contribution
is a new approach for constructing the dual solution where we calibrate the
eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix to be the eigenvectors of the dual matrix.
We believe that this approach may have applications to other recovery problems
in semi-random models as well.
  When $k=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, we give an algorithm for recovering $S$ whose
running time is exponential in the number of small eigenvalues in graph induced
on $S$; this algorithm is based on subspace enumeration techniques due to the
works of [KT07,ABS10,Kol11].

  Input-Output Systems",,,,,"math.OC math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Partial Integral Equations (PIEs) are an alternative way to model systems
governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PIEs have certain advantages
over PDEs in that they are defined by integral (not differential) operators and
do not include boundary conditions or continuity constraints on the solution --
a convenience when computing system properties, designing controllers, or
performing simulation. In prior work, PIE representations were proposed for a
limited class of $2^{nd}$-order PDEs in a single spatial variable. In this
paper, we extend the PIE representation to a more general class of PDE systems
including, e.g., higher-order spatial derivatives ($N^{th}$-order), PDEs with
inputs and outputs, PDEs coupled with ODEs, PDEs with distributed input and
boundary effects, and boundary conditions which combine boundary values with
inputs and integrals of the state.
  These extensions are presented in a unified way by first proposing a unified
parameterization of PDE systems, which we refer to as a Generalized PDE (GPDE).
Given a PDE system in GPDE form, we next propose formulae that takes the GPDE
parameters and constructs the Partial Integral (PI) operators that are used to
define a PIE system. This formula includes a unitary (and hence invertible) map
that converts solutions of the PIE to solutions of the GPDE. This unitary map
is then used to show that the original GPDE and PIE have equivalent system
properties, including well-posedness and stability. These representations,
conversions, and mappings are illustrated through several diverse examples,
including beams, mixing problems, entropy modeling, wave equations, etc.
Finally, we illustrate the significance of the PIE representation by solving

approaches in density-based TO for FRC use the underlying finite element mesh
both for analysis and design representation. This poses several limitations
while enforcing sub-element fiber spacing and generating high-resolution
continuous fibers. In contrast, we propose a mesh-independent representation
based on a neural network (NN) both to capture the matrix topology and fiber
distribution. The implicit NN-based representation enables geometric and
material queries at a higher resolution than a mesh discretization. This leads
to the accurate extraction of functionally-graded continuous fibers. Further,
by integrating the finite element simulations into the NN computational
framework, we can leverage automatic differentiation for end-to-end automated
sensitivity analysis, i.e., we no longer need to manually derive cumbersome
sensitivity expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and computational
efficiency of the proposed method through several numerical examples involving
various objective functions. We also show that the optimized continuous fiber

In such $\gamma$-ray-obscured sources, the $\gamma$-rays that inevitably

prior works usually perform the fusion task by means of multifarious
pixel-level priors. Yet the intrinsic effects of a large distribution gap
between HS-MS data due to differences in the spatial and spectral resolution
are less investigated. The gap might be caused by unknown sensor-specific
properties or highly-mixed spectral information within one pixel (due to low
spatial resolution). To this end, we propose a subpixel-level HS
super-resolution framework by devising a novel decoupled-and-coupled network,
called DC-Net, to progressively fuse HS-MS information from the pixel- to
subpixel-level, from the image- to feature-level. As the name suggests, DC-Net
first decouples the input into common (or cross-sensor) and sensor-specific
components to eliminate the gap between HS-MS images before further fusion, and
then fully blends them by a model-guided coupled spectral unmixing (CSU) net.
More significantly, we append a self-supervised learning module behind the CSU
net by guaranteeing the material consistency to enhance the detailed
appearances of the restored HS product. Extensive experimental results show the
superiority of our method both visually and quantitatively and achieve a

paths taken by the program, which are then going to be examined via
consolidated techniques by matching them against a set of defined rules. The
proposed workflow then requires further analysis with more precise methods if a
rule is violated, in order to assess the actual feasibility of such path(s).
This step is required as the analyses performed to derive the model to analyse

manipulating probability distributions over large alphabets, which we may think
of as long vectors of reals summing to $1$. In some cases it is required to
represent such a vector with only $b$ bits per entry. A natural choice is to
partition the interval $[0,1]$ into $2^b$ uniform bins and quantize entries to
each bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure --
applying an entrywise non-linear function (compander) $f(x)$ prior to
quantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example,
for $b=8 (16)$ and $10^5$-sized alphabets, the quality of representation
improves from a loss (under KL divergence) of $0.5 (0.1)$ bits/entry to
$10^{-4} (10^{-9})$ bits/entry. Compared to floating point representations, our
compander method improves the loss from $10^{-1}(10^{-6})$ to
$10^{-4}(10^{-9})$ bits/entry. These numbers hold for both real-world data

criterion and show that the compander $f(x) ~\propto~

attaining a KL-quantization loss of $\asymp 2^{-2b} \log^2 K$ for a $K$-letter

quadratic loss on the hypercube shows optimality of the standard uniform
quantizer. This suggests that the $\mathrm{ArcSinh}$ quantizer is as

needed for a simple random walk on the graph to visit all vertices of the
graph. It is known that the cover time of any finite connected $n$-vertex graph
is at least $(1 + o(1)) n \log n$ and at most $(1 + o(1)) \frac{4}{27} n^3$. By
Jonasson and Schramm, the cover time of any bounded-degree finite connected
$n$-vertex planar graph is at least $c n(\log n)^2$ and at most $6n^2$, where
$c$ is a positive constant depending only on the maximal degree of the graph.
In particular, the lower bound is established via the use of circle packing of
planar graphs on the Riemann sphere. In this paper, we show that the cover time
of any finite $n$-vertex graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ on the compact
Riemann surface $S$ of given genus $g$ is at least $c n(\log n)^2/ \Delta(g +

models achieve decent performance on a wide range of downstream tasks,
suggesting that they extract different aspects of information from speech.
However, how SSL models store various information in hidden representations
without interfering is still poorly understood. Taking the recently successful
SSL model, HuBERT, as an example, we explore how the SSL model processes and
stores speaker information in the representation. We found that HuBERT stores
speaker information in representations whose positions correspond to silences
in a waveform. There are several pieces of evidence. (1) We find that the
utterances with more silent parts in the waveforms have better Speaker
Identification (SID) accuracy. (2) If we use the whole utterances for SID, the
silence part always contributes more to the SID task. (3) If we only use the
representation of a part of the utterance for SID, the silenced part has higher
accuracy than the other parts. Our findings not only contribute to a better
understanding of SSL models but also improve performance. By simply adding
silence to the original waveform, HuBERT improved its accuracy on SID by nearly
2%.

processes (SGPs) to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The
SGP algorithm is based on a Gaussian process (GP) method, which approximates
the solution of a PDE with the maximum a posteriori probability estimator of a
GP conditioned on the PDE evaluated at a finite number of sample points. The
main bottleneck of the GP method lies in the inversion of a covariance matrix,
whose cost grows cubically with respect to the size of samples. To improve the
scalability of the GP method while retaining desirable accuracy, we draw
inspiration from SGP approximations, where inducing points are introduced to
summarize the information of samples. More precisely, our SGP method uses a
Gaussian prior associated with a low-rank kernel generated by inducing points
randomly selected from samples. In the SGP method, the size of the matrix to be
inverted is proportional to the number of inducing points, which is much less
than the size of the samples. The numerical experiments show that the SGP
method using less than half of the uniform samples as inducing points achieves
comparable accuracy to the GP method using the same number of uniform samples,
which significantly reduces the computational cost. We give the existence proof
for the approximation to the solution of a PDE and provide rigorous error
analysis.

reading the most important information from the memory bank. In this paper, we
propose a Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of constant

Spatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which exploits the cue of historical
information. To avoid error accumulation owing to the recurrent usage of SAM,
we propose an unbiased guidance loss during the training stage, which makes SAM
more robust in long videos. Moreover, the predicted masks in the memory bank
are inaccurate due to the inaccurate network inference, which affects the
segmentation of the query frame. To address this problem, we design a novel
self-correction strategy so that the network can repair the embeddings of masks
with different qualities in the memory bank. Extensive experiments show our

  This competition compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost,

involves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on
an Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale

anisotropy and electronic topology of such a system based on first-principles
calculations with DFT+\textit{U} approach. Our result is that the magnetic
anisotropy energy (MAE) of SL H-FeBr$_2$ shows a non-monotonic evolution

to the competition between different element-resolved MAEs of Fe and Br.
Further investigations show that the evolution of element-resolved MAE arises
from the variation of the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) interaction between
different orbitals in each atom. Moreover, tuning the strength of the
electronic correlation can drive the occurrence of band inversions, causing the
system to undergoes multiple topological phase transitions, resulting in a
quantum anomalous valley Hall (QAVH) effect. These exotic properties are

health). Since news in different domains has different features, researchers
have be-gun to use single domain label for fake news detection recently. This
emerg-ing field is called multi-domain fake news detection (MFND). Existing
works show that using single domain label can improve the accuracy of fake news
detection model. However, there are two problems in previous works. Firstly,
they ignore that a piece of news may have features from different domains. The
single domain label focuses only on the features of the news on particu-lar
domain. This may reduce the performance of the model. Secondly, their model
cannot transfer the domain knowledge to the other dataset without domain label.
In this paper, we propose a novel model, FuDFEND, which solves the limitations
above by introducing the fuzzy inference mechanism. Specifically, FuDFEND
utilizes a neural network to fit the fuzzy inference process which constructs a
fuzzy domain label for each news item. Then, the feature extraction module uses
the fuzzy domain label to extract the multi-domain features of the news and
obtain the total feature representation. Fi-nally, the discriminator module
uses the total feature representation to dis-criminate whether the news item is
fake news. The results on the Weibo21 show that our model works better than the

knowledge better to Thu da-taset which has no domain label.

ECL, and propose to compress the update values of the dual variables. We
demonstrate experimentally that the C-ECL can achieve a nearly equivalent

resulting from compromised wall composition, structure, and function, which can
lead to life-threatening dissection or rupture. Several genetic mutations and
predisposing factors that contribute to TAA have been studied in mouse models
to characterize specific changes in aortic microstructure and material
properties that result from a wide range of mechanobiological insults.
Assessments of TAA progression in vivo is largely limited to measurements of
aneurysm size and growth rate. It has been shown that aortic geometry alone is
not sufficient to predict the patient-specific progression of TAA but
computational modeling of the evolving biomechanics of the aorta could predict
future geometry and properties from initiating insults. In this work, we
present an integrated framework to train a deep operator network
(DeepONet)-based surrogate model to identify contributing factors for TAA by
using FE-based datasets of aortic growth and remodeling resulting from
prescribed insults. For training data, we investigate multiple types of TAA
risk factors and spatial distributions within a constrained mixture model to
generate axial--azimuthal maps of aortic dilatation and distensibility. The
trained network is then capable of predicting the initial distribution and
extent of the insult from a given set of dilatation and distensibility
information. Two DeepONet frameworks are proposed, one trained on sparse
information and one on full-field grayscale images, to gain insight into a
preferred neural operator-based approach. Performance of the surrogate models
is evaluated through multiple simulations carried out on insult distributions
varying from fusiform to complex. We show that the proposed approach can
predict patient-specific mechanobiological insult profile with a high accuracy,

Multi-armed bandits (MAB) algorithms are powerful tools helping users
offloading tasks to their best servers in MEC. However, as the number of users
and tasks growing, the frequency of selecting servers and the cost of making
decision is growing rapidly under traditional MAB algorithms. Inspired by this,

algorithm to solve such problem, which includes two sub-algorithms. We firstly
propose a sub-algorithm in user level (BMSE-UL) to reduce the time cost. In
BMSE-UL, users can simplify its own available server groups and offload tasks

to reduce the frequency of making decision. In BMSE-SL, the system can cut down

sentence-level relation extraction (RE), but this risks leaking superficial and
spurious clues of relations. As a result, RE still suffers from unintended
entity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and
relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that
do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the
entity mentions to prevent the RE models from overfitting entity mentions.
However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the
semantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CORE
(Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that
guides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without
losing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which
models the dependencies between variables in RE models. Then, we propose to
conduct counterfactual analysis on our causal graph to distill and mitigate the
entity bias, that captures the causal effects of specific entity mentions in
each instance. Note that our CORE method is model-agnostic to debias existing
RE systems during inference without changing their training processes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CORE yields significant
gains on both effectiveness and generalization for RE. The source code is

Although existing methods have achieved good performance on testing data with

in application scenarios with data of unseen distributions. In situations where
the training and testing data are drawn from different domains, a typical
approach is to apply domain adaptation techniques to improve face PAD
performance with the help of target domain data. However, it has always been a
non-trivial challenge to collect sufficient data samples in the target domain,
especially for attack samples. This paper introduces a teacher-student
framework to improve the cross-domain performance of face PAD with one-class
domain adaptation. In addition to the source domain data, the framework
utilizes only a few genuine face samples of the target domain. Under this
framework, a teacher network is trained with source domain samples to provide
discriminative feature representations for face PAD. Student networks are
trained to mimic the teacher network and learn similar representations for
genuine face samples of the target domain. In the test phase, the similarity
score between the representations of the teacher and student networks is used
to distinguish attacks from genuine ones. To evaluate the proposed framework
under one-class domain adaptation settings, we devised two new protocols and
conducted extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our method
outperforms baselines under one-class domain adaptation settings and even

terms (or, the ""LL1 tensor decomposition"" in short) offers a valuable
alternative for hyperspectral unmixing (HU) under the linear mixture model.
Particularly, the LL1 decomposition ensures the endmember/abundance
identifiability in scenarios where such guarantees are not supported by the
classic matrix factorization (MF) approaches. However, existing LL1-based HU
algorithms use a three-factor parameterization of the tensor (i.e., the
hyperspectral image cube), which leads to a number of challenges including high
per-iteration complexity, slow convergence, and difficulties in incorporating
structural prior information. This work puts forth an LL1 tensor
decomposition-based HU algorithm that uses a constrained two-factor
re-parameterization of the tensor data. As a consequence, a two-block
alternating gradient projection (GP)-based LL1 algorithm is proposed for HU.
With carefully designed projection solvers, the GP algorithm enjoys a
relatively low per-iteration complexity. Like in MF-based HU, the factors under
our parameterization correspond to the endmembers and abundances. Thus, the
proposed framework is natural to incorporate physics-motivated priors that
arise in HU. The proposed algorithm often attains orders-of-magnitude speedup
and substantial HU performance gains compared to the existing three-factor
parameterization-based HU algorithms.

propose a framework to analyze existing methods during the adaptation. Our
analysis discovers that while some methods have disproportionate focus on
diversity preserving which impede quality improvement, all methods achieve
similar quality after convergence. Therefore, the better methods are those that
can slow down diversity degradation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
there is still plenty of room to further slow down diversity degradation.
Informed by our analysis and to slow down the diversity degradation of the

mutual information (MI) maximization to retain the source domain's rich
multi-level diversity information in the target domain generator. We propose to
perform MI maximization by contrastive loss (CL), leverage the generator and

Extensive experiments on several public datasets show that, while leading to a

minutiae-based fingerprint representation. It was believed that minutiae
templates could not be inverted to obtain a high fidelity fingerprint image,
but this assumption has been shown to be false. The success of deep learning
has resulted in alternative fingerprint representations (embeddings), in the
hope that they might offer better recognition accuracy as well as
non-invertibility of deep network-based templates. We evaluate whether deep
fingerprint templates suffer from the same reconstruction attacks as the
minutiae templates. We show that while a deep template can be inverted to
produce a fingerprint image that could be matched to its source image, deep
templates are more resistant to reconstruction attacks than minutiae templates.
In particular, reconstructed fingerprint images from minutiae templates yield a
TAR of about 100.0% (98.3%) @ FAR of 0.01% for type-I (type-II) attacks using a
state-of-the-art commercial fingerprint matcher, when tested on NIST SD4. The
corresponding attack performance for reconstructed fingerprint images from deep
templates using the same commercial matcher yields a TAR of less than 1% for
both type-I and type-II attacks; however, when the reconstructed images are
matched using the same deep network, they achieve a TAR of 85.95% (68.10%) for
type-I (type-II) attacks. Furthermore, what is missing from previous
fingerprint template inversion studies is an evaluation of the black-box attack
performance, which we perform using 3 different state-of-the-art fingerprint
matchers. We conclude that fingerprint images generated by inverting minutiae
templates are highly susceptible to both white-box and black-box attack
evaluations, while fingerprint images generated by deep templates are resistant
to black-box evaluations and comparatively less susceptible to white-box
evaluations.

mixture component parameters and the required number of components. A revised
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is also proposed as a pre-step for
DPGMM. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-divergence) is utilized as an error
metric to examine the amount of inaccuracy of the EM algorithm and DPGMM when
modeling the experimental probability density functions (PDFs). DPGMM and EM
algorithm are implemented over the measurements taken at frequencies between

predictions for semantically opposite inputs, is an important property that a
trustworthy language model must satisfy. However, much recent evidence shows
that large-size pre-trained language models (PLMs) do not satisfy this
property. In this paper, we perform experiments using probing tasks to assess
PLM's LNP understanding. Unlike previous studies that only examined negation
expressions, we expand the boundary of the investigation to lexical semantics.
Through experiments, we observe that PLMs violate the LNP frequently. To
alleviate the issue, we propose a novel intermediate training task, names
meaning-matching, designed to directly learn a meaning-text correspondence,
instead of relying on the distributional hypothesis. Through multiple
experiments, we find that the task enables PLMs to learn lexical semantic
information. Also, through fine-tuning experiments on 7 GLUE tasks, we confirm
that it is a safe intermediate task that guarantees a similar or better
performance of downstream tasks. Finally, we observe that our proposed approach
outperforms our previous counterparts despite its time and resource efficiency.

potential impact of missing data is often overlooked. In practice, it also
affects their implementation where the simplest approach to overcome this is to
continue to sample according to the original bandit algorithm, ignoring missing
outcomes. We investigate the impact on performance of this approach to deal
with missing data for several bandit algorithms through an extensive simulation
study assuming the rewards are missing at random. We focus on two-armed bandit
algorithms with binary outcomes in the context of patient allocation for
clinical trials with relatively small sample sizes. However, our results apply
to other applications of bandit algorithms where missing data is expected to
occur. We assess the resulting operating characteristics, including the
expected reward. Different probabilities of missingness in both arms are
considered. The key finding of our work is that when using the simplest
strategy of ignoring missing data, the impact on the expected performance of
multi-armed bandit strategies varies according to the way these strategies
balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Algorithms that are geared
towards exploration continue to assign samples to the arm with more missing
responses (which being perceived as the arm with less observed information is
deemed more appealing by the algorithm than it would otherwise be). In
contrast, algorithms that are geared towards exploitation would rapidly assign
a high value to samples from the arms with a current high mean irrespective of
the level observations per arm. Furthermore, for algorithms focusing more on
exploration, we illustrate that the problem of missing responses can be
alleviated using a simple mean imputation approach.

homography estimation to focus on the dominant plane. First, a multi-scale
transformer network is designed to predict homography from the feature pyramids
of input images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, we propose an
unsupervised GAN to impose coplanarity constraint on the predicted homography,
which is realized by using a generator to predict a mask of aligned regions,
and then a discriminator to check if two masked feature maps are induced by a
single homography. To validate the effectiveness of HomoGAN and its components,
we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, and the results show
that our matching error is 22% lower than the previous SOTA method. Code is

by using cutting-edge techniques such as microtomography, a range of flax stems

after mechanical extraction of the fibres. Hypotheses regarding the kink-band

their excess negative/positive temperature. The stable state is characterized
by a flow with low turbulent kinetic energy, strongly stable temperature
gradient, and no large-scale features. The convective state is characterized by
higher turbulent kinetic energy, self-sustaining large-scale convection, and
weakly stable temperature gradients. The particles individually promote the
formation of stable temperature gradients, while their aggregated effect
induces large-scale convection. When the Lagrangian temperature scale is small,
a weakly convective laminar system forms. The Lagrangian approach is also
compared to a uniform Eulerian bulk heating with the same mean injection
profile and no such transition is observed. Our empirical approach shows that
thermal convection can be controlled by pure Lagrangian forcing and opens the
way for other data-driven particle-based protocols to enhance or deplete
large-scale motion in thermal flows.

attracted to the topological valley transport in classical metacrystals. The
presence of nontrivial domain-wall states is interpreted with a concept of
valley Chern number, which is well defined only in the limit of small bandgap.
Here, we propose a new visual angle to track the intricate valley topology in
classical systems. Benefiting from the controllability of our acoustic
metacrystals, we construct Weyl points in synthetic three-dimensional momentum
space through introducing an extra structural parameter (rotation angle here).
As such, the two-dimensional valley-projected band topology can be tracked with
the strictly quantized topological charge in three-dimensional Weyl crystal,
which features open surface arcs connecting the synthetic Weyl points and
gapless chiral surface states along specific Weyl paths. All theoretical
predictions are conclusively identified by our acoustic experiments. Our
findings may promote the development of topological valley physics, which is
less well-defined yet under hot debate in multiple physical disciplines.

Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class has emerged. Theoretical
developments (e.g. generalized hydrodynamics) have highlighted the role of
integrability as well as spin-symmetry in KPZ behaviour. However understanding
their precise role on superdiffusive transport still remains a challenging
task. The widely used quantum spin chain platform comes with severe numerical
limitations. To circumvent this barrier, we focus on a classical integrable
spin chain which was shown to have deep analogy with the quantum
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain. Remarkably, we find that KPZ behaviour
prevails even when one considers integrability-breaking but spin-symmetry
preserving terms, strongly indicating that spin-symmetry plays a central role
even in the non-perturbative regime. On the other hand, in the non-perturbative
regime, we find that energy correlations exhibit clear diffusive behaviour. We
also study the classical analog of out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and
Lyapunov exponents. We find significant presence of chaos for the
integrability-broken cases even though KPZ behaviour remains robust. The
robustness of KPZ behaviour is demonstrated for a wide class of spin-symmetry
preserving integrability-breaking terms.

triplet scalar boson. Although it seems the proton decay constraint would doom
such a low-scale unification, we show that the constraint can be avoided by
introducing vector-like fermions which mix with the SM fermions through mass
terms involving the VEV of GUT breaking Higgs field. Importantly, the simplest
viable model only requires the addition of one pair of vector-like fermions

The proposed test is able to control the type-I error at any desired level and

radio measurements - time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA),
received signal strength (RSS) and angle of arrival (AOA). First, after
invoking tractable approximations in the RSS and AOA models, the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) problem for the hybrid TOA-TDOA-RSS-AOA data model
is derived. Then, in the MLE, which has the least-squares objective, weights
determined using the range-based characteristics of the four heterogeneous
measurements, are introduced. The resultant weighted least-squares problem
obtained, which is non-smooth and non-convex, is solved using the principle of
the majorization-minimization (MM), leading to an iterative algorithm that has
a guaranteed convergence. The key feature of the proposed method is that it
provides a unified framework where localization using any possible merger out
of these four measurements can be implemented as per the

the estimation efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method employing
all four measurements is compared against a conventionally used method and also
against the proposed method employing only limited combinations of the four
measurements. The results obtained indicate that the hybrid localization model
improves the localization accuracy compared to the heterogeneous measurements.
The integration of different measurements also yields good accuracy in the
presence of non-line of sight (NLOS) errors.

Gravitational waves from binary NS mergers are expected to convey useful

with realistic EOS is not yet established. Here, we show that the gravitational
wave in the post-merger stage can distinguish the theory scenarios with and

previously, we compile reliable EOS constraints from the ab initio approaches.
We demonstrate that early collapse to a black hole after NS merger signifies
softening of the EOS associated with the onset of QM in accord with ab initio
constraints. Nature of hadron-quark phase transition can be further constrained
by the condition that electromagnetic counterparts need to be energized by the

collaborative machine learning, distributed estimation and control, and
large-scale sensing. Since involved data usually contain sensitive information
like user locations, healthcare records and financial transactions, privacy
protection has become an increasingly pressing need in the implementation of
decentralized stochastic optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a
decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithm which is embedded with
inherent privacy protection for every participating agent against other
participating agents and external eavesdroppers. This proposed algorithm builds
in a dynamics based gradient-obfuscation mechanism to enable privacy protection
without compromising optimization accuracy, which is in significant difference
from differential-privacy based privacy solutions for decentralized
optimization that have to trade optimization accuracy for privacy. The dynamics
based privacy approach is encryption-free, and hence avoids incurring heavy
communication or computation overhead, which is a common problem with
encryption based privacy solutions for decentralized stochastic optimization.
Besides rigorously characterizing the convergence performance of the proposed
decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithm under both convex objective
functions and non-convex objective functions, we also provide rigorous
information-theoretic analysis of its strength of privacy protection.
Simulation results for a distributed estimation problem as well as numerical
experiments for decentralized learning on a benchmark machine learning dataset
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

cationic disorder, as observed in most ordered materials, can produce
significant changes in charge compensation mechanisms, anionic activity,
lithium diffusion and operational voltages. In this work, we report the
variation in structural distortion, electronic structure and migration barrier
accompanied by disorder using first-principles calculations. Due to segregation
of lithium atoms in the disordered state, we observe greater distortion,
emergence of metallic behaviour and potential anionic activity from non-bonding
oxygen states near the Fermi level. Redox capacity can be tuned by doping with
3d metals which can adjust the participating cationic states, and by fluorine
substitution which can stabilize or suppress anionic states. Moreover,
suppression of anionic activity is found to decrease structural distortion,
crucial for mitigating voltage fade and hysteresis. Diffusion barrier
calculations in the presence of disorder indicate the activation of the
remaining 3D-paths for lithium hopping which are unavailable in the ordered
configuration, explaining its fast-charging ability observed in experiments.

studies are seemingly contrasting about its effect on arguably the most
fundamental network statistic, the degree distribution. The key question is
about the functional form of the degree distributions that can be altered
during node removal or sampling, which is decisive in the remaining
subnetwork's static and dynamical properties. In this work, we clarify the
situation by utilizing the relative entropies with respect to the reference
distributions in the Poisson and power-law form. Introducing general sequential
node removal processes with continuously different levels of hub protection to
encompass a series of scenarios including random removal and preferred or
protective removal of the hub, we classify the altered degree distributions
starting from various power-law forms by comparing two relative entropy values.
From the extensive investigation in various scenarios based on direct
node-removal simulations and by solving the rate equation of degree
distributions, we discover in the parameter space two distinct regimes, one
where the degree distribution is closer to the power-law reference distribution
and the other closer to the Poisson distribution.

years, thanks to the availability of large-scale paired data for training.
Nevertheless, obtaining adequate recipe-image pairs covering the majority of

transferring knowledge learnt from a data-rich cuisine to a data-scarce
cuisine, domain adaptation sheds light on this practical problem. Nevertheless,
existing works assume recipes in source and target domains are mostly
originated from the same cuisine and written in the same language. This paper
studies unsupervised domain adaptation for image-to-recipe retrieval, where
recipes in source and target domains are in different languages. Moreover, only
recipes are available for training in the target domain. A novel recipe mixup
method is proposed to learn transferable embedding features between the two
domains. Specifically, recipe mixup produces mixed recipes to form an
intermediate domain by discretely exchanging the section(s) between source and
target recipes. To bridge the domain gap, recipe mixup loss is proposed to
enforce the intermediate domain to locate in the shortest geodesic path between
source and target domains in the recipe embedding space. By using Recipe 1M

Instead, the proposed operator used to learn the point cloud embedding in the
encoder extracts permutation-invariant features from the point cloud via a
soft-pooling of feature activations, which are able to preserve fine-grained
geometric details. These features are then passed on to a decoder architecture.
Due to the compression in the encoder, a typical limitation of this type of

propose to overcome this limitation by using skip connections specifically
devised for point clouds, where links between corresponding layers in the
encoder and the decoder are established. As part of these connections, we
introduce a transformation matrix that projects the features from the encoder
to the decoder and vice-versa. The quantitative and qualitative results on the

incorporating our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in shape

patients exhibit a $+4.43$ years ($\text{$p$} < 0.0001$, $\text{Cohen's $d$} =

  Correction made to Fig. 7",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this article, we consider the benefit of increasing adaptivity of an
existing robust estimation algorithm by learning two parameters to better fit
the residual distribution. Our method uses these two parameters to calculate
weights for Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS). This adaptive nature of
the weights can be helpful in situations where the noise level varies in the
measurements. We test our algorithm first on the point cloud registration
problem with synthetic data sets and lidar odometry with open-source real-world
data sets. We show that the existing approach needs an additional manual tuning
of a residual scale parameter which our method directly learns from data and
has similar or better performance.

an optimization algorithm that reaps the benefits of both Exponentially
Averaged Momentum PSO and HMC sampling. The coupling of the position and
velocity of each particle with Hamiltonian dynamics in the simulation allows
for extensive freedom for exploration and exploitation of the search space. It
also provides an excellent technique to explore highly non-convex functions
while ensuring efficient sampling. We extend the method to approximate error
gradients in closed form for Deep Neural Network (DNN) settings. We discuss
possible methods of coupling and compare its performance to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers on the Golomb's Ruler problem and Classification
tasks.
