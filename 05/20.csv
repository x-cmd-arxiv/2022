  Ranking",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In information retrieval (IR), candidate set pruning has been commonly used
to speed up two-stage relevance ranking. However, such an approach lacks
accurate error control and often trades accuracy off against computational
efficiency in an empirical fashion, lacking theoretical guarantees. In this
paper, we propose the concept of certified error control of candidate set
pruning for relevance ranking, which means that the test error after pruning is
guaranteed to be controlled under a user-specified threshold with high
probability. Both in-domain and out-of-domain experiments show that our method
successfully prunes the first-stage retrieved candidate sets to improve the
second-stage reranking speed while satisfying the pre-specified accuracy
constraints in both settings. For example, on MS MARCO Passage v1, our method
yields an average candidate set size of 27 out of 1,000 which increases the
reranking speed by about 37 times, while the MRR@10 is greater than a
pre-specified value of 0.38 with about 90% empirical coverage and the empirical
baselines fail to provide such guarantee. Code and data are available at:

enabling developers to efficiently store and process collections of data with
an easy-to-use programming interface. Many programming languages offer a
variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data
structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics.
  Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always
straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in
different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to
theoretical complexity.
  Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the
best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data
types that satisfy *properties* given by application developers. Primrose
automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the
*library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries,
satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library
implementations based on their runtime performance.
  Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected
behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g.,
if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should
satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement
*syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together
allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and*
behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation.
  Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that
preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and
ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however,
language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages
that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our
implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification
conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set
of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several
container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid
implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We
automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library
specifications via property-based testing.
  Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling
and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow.
Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application
programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the
behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation
can be selected automatically.

representations (MRs) often suffers from limited training examples, due to the
high cost of annotating MR-to-Text pairs. Previous works on self-training
leverage fine-tuned conversational models to automatically generate
pseudo-labeled MR-to-Text pairs for further fine-tuning. However, some
self-augmented data may be noisy or uninformative for the model to learn from.
In this work, we propose a two-phase self-augmentation procedure to generate
high-quality pseudo-labeled MR-to-Text pairs: the first phase selects the most
informative MRs based on model's prediction uncertainty; with the selected MRs,
the second phase generates accurate responses by aggregating multiple perturbed
latent representations from each MR. Empirical experiments on two benchmark
datasets, FewShotWOZ and FewShotSGD, show that our method generally outperforms
existing self-training methods on both automatic and human evaluations.

Phased Array Feeds (PAFs) are multi element receivers in the focal
plane of a telescope that make it possible to form simultaneously multiple
beams on the sky by combining the complex gains of the individual antenna
elements. Recently the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) was upgraded
with PAF receivers and carried out several observing programs including two
imaging surveys and a time domain survey. The Apertif imaging surveys use a
configuration, where 40 partially overlapping compound beams (CBs) are
simultaneously formed on the sky and arranged in an approximately rectangular
shape. Aims. This manuscript aims to characterise the response of the 40
Apertif CBs to create frequency-resolved, I, XX and YY polarization empirical
beam shapes. The measured CB maps can be used for image deconvolution, primary
beam correction and mosaicing of Apertif imaging data. Methods. We use drift
scan measurements to measure the response of each of the 40 CBs of Apertif. We
derive beam maps for all individual beams in I, XX and YY polarisation in 10 or
18 frequency bins over the same bandwidth as the Apertif imaging surveys. We
sample the main lobe of the beams and the side lobes up to a radius of 0.6
degrees from the beam centres. In addition, we derive beam maps for each
individual WSRT dish as well. Results. We present the frequency and time
dependence of the beam shapes and sizes. We compare the compound beam shapes
derived with the drift scan method to beam shapes derived with an independent
method using a Gaussian Process Regression comparison between the Apertif
continuum images and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue. We find a good
agreement between the beam shapes derived with the two independent methods.

as the encoder to extract features and reduce the complexity. The Recurrent
Prototype Module (RPM) is proposed to train the encoder effectively in a
semi-supervised manner. To alleviate the data imbalance problem, we introduce
the Weight-Task Consistency (WTC) into the iterative process of RPM by
assigning larger weights to classes with fewer samples in the loss function. In
addition, to cope with new attacks in real-world deployment, we propose an
Active Adaption Resampling (AAR) method, which can better discover the
distribution of unseen sample data and adapt the parameters of encoder.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art

ratings for the same items should be embedded into similar representations),
which is an ideological disadvantage. On the other hand, ME models directly
employ inner products as a default loss function metric that cannot project
users and items into a proper latent space, which is a methodological
disadvantage. In this paper, we propose a supervised collaborative
representation learning model - Magnetic Metric Learning (MML) - to map users
and items into a unified latent vector space, enhancing the representation
learning for NN-RSs. Firstly, MML utilizes dual triplets to model not only the
observed relationships between users and items, but also the underlying
relationships between users as well as items to overcome the ideological
disadvantage. Specifically, a modified metric-based dual loss function is
proposed in MML to gather similar entities and disperse the dissimilar ones.
With MML, we can easily compare all the relationships (user to user, item to
item, user to item) according to the weighted metric, which overcomes the
methodological disadvantage. We conduct extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets with large item space. The results demonstrate that MML can
learn a proper unified latent space for representations from the user-item

Typically, when performing supervised deep learning, a WSI is divided into
small patches, trained and the outcomes are aggregated to estimate disease
grade. However, patch-based methods introduce label noise during training by
assuming that each patch is independent with the same label as the WSI and
neglect overall WSI-level information that is significant in disease grading.
Here we present a Graph-Transformer (GT) that fuses a graph-based
representation of an WSI and a vision transformer for processing pathology
images, called GTP, to predict disease grade. We selected $4,818$ WSIs from the
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), the National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and used GTP to
distinguish adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) from
adjacent non-cancerous tissue (normal). First, using NLST data, we developed a
contrastive learning framework to generate a feature extractor. This allowed us
to compute feature vectors of individual WSI patches, which were used to
represent the nodes of the graph followed by construction of the GTP framework.
Our model trained on the CPTAC data achieved consistently high performance on
three-label classification (normal versus LUAD versus LSCC: mean accuracy$=
91.2$ $\pm$ $2.5\%$) based on five-fold cross-validation, and mean accuracy $=
82.3$ $\pm$ $1.0\%$ on external test data (TCGA). We also introduced a

malicious users (PMUs), who utilize negative reviews and low ratings to their
consumed products on purpose to threaten the retailers for illegal profits.
Specifically, there are three challenges for PMU detection: 1) professional
malicious users do not conduct any abnormal or illegal interactions (they never
concurrently leave too many negative reviews and low ratings at the same time),
and they conduct masking strategies to disguise themselves. Therefore,
conventional outlier detection methods are confused by their masking
strategies. 2) the PMU detection model should take both ratings and reviews
into consideration, which makes PMU detection a multi-modal problem. 3) there
are no datasets with labels for professional malicious users in public, which
makes PMU detection an unsupervised learning problem. To this end, we propose
an unsupervised multi-modal learning model: MMD, which employs Metric learning
for professional Malicious users Detection with both ratings and reviews. MMD
first utilizes a modified RNN to project the informational review into a
sentiment score, which jointly considers the ratings and reviews. Then
professional malicious user profiling (MUP) is proposed to catch the sentiment
gap between sentiment scores and ratings. MUP filters the users and builds a
candidate PMU set. We apply a metric learning-based clustering to learn a

labeled users to detect PMUs. Specifically, we apply the attention mechanism in
metric learning to improve the model's performance. The extensive experiments

BeamTracking. It is mainly inspired by the image captioning task, which takes
an image as input and generates diverse descriptions using beam search
algorithm. Accordingly, we formulate the tracking as a sample selection problem
fulfilled by multiple parallel decision-making processes, each of which aims at
picking out one sample as their tracking result in each frame. Each maintained
trajectory is associated with an agent to perform the decision-making and
determine what actions should be taken to update related information. When all
the frames are processed, we select the trajectory with the maximum accumulated

deep compact architectures when trained using semi-supervised learning methods
for tackling image classification tasks in the biomedical context. In
particular, we explore three families of compact networks, and two families of
semi-supervised learning techniques for 10 biomedical tasks. By combining
semi-supervised learning methods with compact networks, it is possible to
obtain a similar performance to standard size networks. In general, the best

  Networks",,,,,"math.OC cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ridesharing markets are complex: drivers are strategic, rider demand and
driver availability are stochastic, and complex city-scale phenomena like
weather induce large scale correlation across space and time. At the same time,
past work has focused on a subset of these challenges. We propose a model of
ridesharing networks with strategic drivers, spatiotemporal dynamics, and
stochasticity. Supporting both computational tractability and better modeling
flexibility than classical fluid limits, we use a two-level stochastic model
that allows correlated shocks caused by weather or large public events.
  Using this model, we propose a novel pricing mechanism: stochastic
spatiotemporal pricing (SSP). We show that the SSP mechanism is asymptotically
incentive-compatible and that all (approximate) equilibria of the resulting
game are asymptotically welfare-maximizing when the market is large enough. The
SSP mechanism iteratively recomputes prices based on realized demand and
supply, and in this sense prices dynamically. We show that this is critical:
while a static variant of the SSP mechanism (whose prices vary with the
market-level stochastic scenario but not individual rider and driver decisions)
has a sequence of asymptotically welfare-optimal approximate equilibria, we
demonstrate that it also has other equilibria producing extremely low social
welfare. Thus, we argue that dynamic pricing is important for ensuring
robustness in stochastic ride-sharing networks.

precipitation tomorrow, but with only a 30% chance. Given such probabilistic
predictions together with the actual outcomes, ""reliability diagrams"" help
detect and diagnose statistically significant discrepancies -- so-called
""miscalibration"" -- between the predictions and the outcomes. The canonical
reliability diagrams histogram the observed and expected values of the
predictions; replacing the hard histogram binning with soft kernel density
estimation is another common practice. But, which widths of bins or kernels are
best? Plots of the cumulative differences between the observed and expected
values largely avoid this question, by displaying miscalibration directly as
the slopes of secant lines for the graphs. Slope is easy to perceive with
quantitative precision, even when the constant offsets of the secant lines are
irrelevant; there is no need to bin or perform kernel density estimation.
  The existing standard metrics of miscalibration each summarize a reliability
diagram as a single scalar statistic. The cumulative plots naturally lead to
scalar metrics for the deviation of the graph of cumulative differences away
from zero; good calibration corresponds to a horizontal, flat graph which
deviates little from zero. The cumulative approach is currently unconventional,
yet offers many favorable statistical properties, guaranteed via mathematical
theory backed by rigorous proofs and illustrative numerical examples. In
particular, metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation unavoidably
must trade-off statistical confidence for the ability to resolve variations as
a function of the predicted probability or vice versa. Widening the bins or
kernels averages away random noise while giving up some resolving power.
Narrowing the bins or kernels enhances resolving power while not averaging away
as much noise.

Phase 1 of the Real Robot Challenge (RRC) 2021, and then extends this method to
a more difficult manipulation task. The RRC consisted of using a TriFinger
robot to manipulate a cube along a specified positional trajectory, but with no
requirement for the cube to have any specific orientation. We used a relatively
simple reward function, a combination of goal-based sparse reward and distance
reward, in conjunction with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to guide the
learning of the DRL agent (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)). Our
approach allowed our agents to acquire dexterous robotic manipulation
strategies in simulation. These strategies were then applied to the real robot
and outperformed all other competition submissions, including those using more
traditional robotic control techniques, in the final evaluation stage of the
RRC. Here we extend this method, by modifying the task of Phase 1 of the RRC to
require the robot to maintain the cube in a particular orientation, while the
cube is moved along the required positional trajectory. The requirement to also
orient the cube makes the agent unable to learn the task through blind
exploration due to increased problem complexity. To circumvent this issue, we
make novel use of a Knowledge Transfer (KT) technique that allows the
strategies learned by the agent in the original task (which was agnostic to
cube orientation) to be transferred to this task (where orientation matters).
KT allowed the agent to learn and perform the extended task in the simulator,
which improved the average positional deviation from 0.134 m to 0.02 m, and
average orientation deviation from 142{\deg} to 76{\deg} during evaluation.
This KT concept shows good generalisation properties and could be applied to
any actor-critic learning algorithm.

combining recently introduced vector neurons with self-attention layers to

successful for images by applying directly on sequences of image patches and

this adaptation attention layers become SO(3) and the overall network becomes
rotational invariant. Experiments demonstrate that our network efficiently

two-dimensional images. In order to obtain a physical phase diagram, the snake
model with an artificial neural network is applied in an unsupervised learning

boundary as an initial snake and then drives the snake to convergence with
forces estimated by the artificial neural network. In this paper, we extend
this unsupervised learning method with one contour to a snake net with multiple
contours for the purpose of obtaining several phase boundaries in a phase
diagram. For the classical Blume-Capel model, the phase diagram containing
three and four phases is obtained. Moreover, to overcome the limitations of the
initial position and speed up the movement of the snake, the balloon force
decaying with the iteration steps is introduced and applied to the snake net
structure. Our method is helpful in determining the phase diagram with multiple
phases, using just snapshots of configurations from cold atoms or other
experiments without knowledge of the phases.

chaos both classically and quantum-mechanically. Its structure closely
resembles that of spatially compactified pure Yang-Mills theory.
Correspondingly, the structure of our supersymmetric Hamiltonian is similar to
that of spatially compactified supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, also known as
the BFSS model. We present numerical evidence that a continuous energy spectrum
of the supersymmetric model leads to monotonous growth of OTOCs down to the
lowest temperatures, which is also expected for the BFSS model from holographic
duality. This growth is saturated by low-energy eigenstates with effectively
one-dimensional wave functions and a completely non-chaotic energy level
distribution. We observe a sharp boundary separating these low-energy states
from the bulk of chaotic high-energy states. Our data suggests, although with a
limited confidence, that at low temperatures the OTOC growth might be
exponential over a finite range of time, with the corresponding Lyapunov
exponent scaling linearly with temperature. In contrast, the gapped low-energy
spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian leads to oscillating OTOCs at low
temperatures without any signatures of exponential growth. We also find that
the OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian are never sufficiently close to the
classical Lyapunov distance. On the other hand, the OTOCs for the
supersymmetric system agree with the classical limit reasonably well over a
finite range of temperatures and evolution times.

attention in the theoretical computer science and machine learning communities

clustering. Despite the existence of several provably exact algorithms for
tree-metric fitting of data that inherently obeys tree-metric constraints, much
less is known about how to best fit tree-metrics for data whose structure
moderately (or substantially) differs from a tree. For such noisy data, most
available algorithms perform poorly and often produce negative edge weights in
representative trees. Furthermore, it is currently not known how to choose the
most suitable approximation objective for noisy fitting. Our contributions are
as follows. First, we propose a new approach to tree-metric denoising
(HyperAid) in hyperbolic spaces which transforms the original data into data
that is ``more'' tree-like, when evaluated in terms of Gromov's $\delta$
hyperbolicity. Second, we perform an ablation study involving two choices for
the approximation objective, $\ell_p$ norms and the Dasgupta loss. Third, we
integrate HyperAid with schemes for enforcing nonnegative edge-weights. As a
result, the HyperAid platform outperforms all other existing methods in the
literature, including Neighbor Joining (NJ), TreeRep and T-REX, both on
synthetic and real-world data. Synthetic data is represented by edge-augmented
trees and shortest-distance metrics while the real-world datasets include Zoo,

that can reach clinical expert level performance. However, such systems tend to
demonstrate sub-optimal ""out-of-distribution"" performance when evaluated in
clinical settings different from the training environment. A common mitigation
strategy is to develop separate systems for each clinical setting using
site-specific data [1]. However, this quickly becomes impractical as medical
data is time-consuming to acquire and expensive to annotate [2]. Thus, the
problem of ""data-efficient generalization"" presents an ongoing difficulty for
Medical AI development. Although progress in representation learning shows
promise, their benefits have not been rigorously studied, specifically for
out-of-distribution settings. To meet these challenges, we present REMEDIS, a
unified representation learning strategy to improve robustness and
data-efficiency of medical imaging AI. REMEDIS uses a generic combination of
large-scale supervised transfer learning with self-supervised learning and
requires little task-specific customization. We study a diverse range of
medical imaging tasks and simulate three realistic application scenarios using
retrospective data. REMEDIS exhibits significantly improved in-distribution
performance with up to 11.5% relative improvement in diagnostic accuracy over a
strong supervised baseline. More importantly, our strategy leads to strong
data-efficient generalization of medical imaging AI, matching strong supervised
baselines using between 1% to 33% of retraining data across tasks. These

planet candidates based on periodic flux dips observed by NASA's Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The signals were confirmed to be from
transiting planets using ground-based time-series photometry, high angular
resolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy coordinated with the TESS
Follow-up Observing Program. The ten newly discovered planets orbit relatively
bright F and G stars ($G < 12.5$,~$T_\mathrm{eff}$ between 4800 and 6200 K).
The planets' orbital periods range from 2 to 10~days, and their masses range
from 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421 b is notable for being a Saturn-mass
planet and TOI-2567 b for being a ``sub-Saturn'', with masses of $0.322\pm

limit of $e < 0.052$. The ten planets described here are the first new planets

previous ground-based transit surveys in order to create a large and

In contrast, biological learning seems to value efficiency of adaptation to a

learning rule that assumes each neuron can optimize its energy balance by
predicting its own future activity. That assumption leads to a neuronal
learning rule that uses presynaptic input to modulate prediction error. We
argue that an analogous RL rule would use action probability to modulate reward
prediction error. This modulation makes the agent more sensitive to negative
experiences, and more careful in forming preferences. We embed the proposed
rule in both tabular and deep-Q-network RL algorithms, and find that it
outperforms conventional algorithms in simple, but highly-dynamic tasks. We
suggest that the new rule encapsulates a core principle of biological

We hypothesize that this is due to an inherent bias of global attention towards

approach, where high-frequency features interact locally and low-frequency
features interact globally. The global interaction stream remains robust in
difficult situations such as large camera motions, where explicit alignment
fails. The local interaction stream propagates high-frequency details through
deformable feature aggregation and, informed by the global interaction stream,
learns to detect and correct errors of the deformation field. We evaluate our
two-stream approach for inpainting tasks, where experiments show that it
improves both the propagation of features within a single frame as required for
image inpainting, as well as their propagation from keyframes to target frames.

Recently, this concept has found applications beyond quantum computing -- in
studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems and the long-time properties

complexity of a chaotic quantum system grows linearly in time up to times
exponential in the system size, saturating at a maximal value, and remaining
maximally complex until undergoing recurrences at doubly-exponential times. In
this work we prove the saturation and recurrence of the complexity of quantum
states and unitaries in a model of chaotic time-evolution based on random
quantum circuits, in which a local random unitary transformation is applied to
the system at every time step. Importantly, our findings hold for quite general
random circuit models, irrespective of the gate set and geometry of qubit

  Selection Model for the Health Insurance Experiment and Beyond",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Finite Selection Model (FSM) was developed by Carl Morris in the 1970s
for the design of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) (Morris 1979,
Newhouse et al. 1993), one of the largest and most comprehensive social science
experiments conducted in the U.S. The idea behind the FSM is that each
treatment group takes its turns selecting units in a fair and random order to
optimize a common criterion. At each of its turns, a treatment group selects
the available unit that maximally improves the combined quality of its
resulting group of units in terms of the criterion. In the HIE and beyond, we
revisit, formalize, and extend the FSM as a general tool for experimental
design.
  Leveraging the idea of D-optimality, we propose and analyze a new selection
criterion in the FSM. The FSM using the D-optimal selection function has no
tuning parameters, is affine invariant, and when appropriate retrieves several
classical designs such as randomized block and matched-pair designs. For
multi-arm experiments, we propose algorithms to generate a fair and random
selection order of treatments. We demonstrate FSM's performance in a case study
based on the HIE and in ten randomized studies from the health and social
sciences. On average, the FSM achieves 68% better covariate balance than
complete randomization and 56% better covariate balance than rerandomization in
a typical study. We recommend the FSM be considered in experimental design for
its conceptual simplicity, efficiency, balance, and robustness.

computational model (AIGenC) that lays down the necessary components to enable
artificial agents to learn, use and generate transferable representations.
Unlike machine representation learning, which relies exclusively on raw sensory
data, biological representations incorporate relational and associative
information that embeds rich and structured concept spaces. The AIGenC model
poses a hierarchical graph architecture with various levels and types of
representations procured by different components. The first component, Concept
Processing, extracts objects and affordances from sensory input and encodes
them into a concept space. The resulting representations are stored in a dual
memory system and enriched with goal-directed and temporal information acquired
through reinforcement learning, creating a higher-level of abstraction. Two
additional components work in parallel to detect and recover relevant concepts
and create new ones, respectively, in a process akin to cognitive Reflective
Reasoning and Blending. The Reflective Reasoning unit detects and recovers from
memory concepts relevant to the task by means of a matching process that
calculates a similarity value between the current state and memory graph
structures. Once the matching interaction ends, rewards and temporal
information are added to the graph, building further abstractions. If the
reflective reasoning processing fails to offer a suitable solution, a blending
operation comes into place, creating new concepts by combining past
information. We discuss the model's capability to yield better
out-of-distribution generalisation in artificial agents, thus advancing toward
Artificial General Intelligence.

improve out-of-distribution generalization. In particular, weight averaging
(WA) strategies were shown to perform best on the competitive DomainBed
benchmark; they directly average the weights of multiple networks despite their
nonlinearities. In this paper, we propose Diverse Weight Averaging (DiWA), a
new WA strategy whose main motivation is to increase the functional diversity
across averaged models. To this end, DiWA averages weights obtained from
several independent training runs: indeed, models obtained from different runs
are more diverse than those collected along a single run thanks to differences
in hyperparameters and training procedures. We motivate the need for diversity
by a new bias-variance-covariance-locality decomposition of the expected error,
exploiting similarities between WA and standard functional ensembling.
Moreover, this decomposition highlights that WA succeeds when the variance term
dominates, which we show occurs when the marginal distribution changes at test
time. Experimentally, DiWA consistently improves the state of the art on
DomainBed without inference overhead.

electronic phases, but it was often thought that the superconductivity at
sufficiently high doping is governed by conventional mean-field
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory[1]. However, recent measurements show
that the number of paired electrons (the superfluid density) vanishes when the
transition temperature Tc goes to zero[2], in contradiction to expectation from
BCS theory. The origin of this anomalous vanishing is unknown. Our scanning
tunneling spectroscopy measurements in the overdoped regime of the
(Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+{\delta} high-temperature superconductor show that it is due to
the emergence of puddled superconductivity, featuring nanoscale superconducting
islands in a metallic matrix[3,4]. Our measurements further reveal that this
puddling is driven by gap filling, while the gap itself persists beyond the
breakdown of superconductivity. The important implication is that it is not a
diminishing pairing interaction that causes the breakdown of superconductivity.
Unexpectedly, the measured gap-to-filling correlation also reveals that
pair-breaking by disorder does not play a dominant role and that the mechanism
of superconductivity in overdoped cuprate superconductors is qualitatively
different from conventional mean-field theory.

approach to the extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ from the
experimental data on the exclusive $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)}^{(*)} \ell \nu_\ell$
decays. The DM method allows to achieve a non-perturbative, model-independent
determination of the momentum dependence of the semileptonic form factors.
Starting from lattice results available at large values of the 4-momentum
transfer and implementing non-perturbative unitarity bounds, the behaviour of
the form factors in their whole kinematical range is obtained without
introducing any explicit parameterization of their momentum dependence. We
firstly illustrate the effectiveness of the method by considering the case of
the semileptonic $B \rightarrow \pi$ decay, which is a good benchmark since the
kinematic range is large. Then, we focus on the four exclusive semileptonic
$B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)}^{(*)} \ell \nu_\ell$ decays and we extract $|V_{cb}|$ from
the experimental data for each transition. The average over the four channels
is $|V_{cb}| = (41.2 \pm 0.8) \cdot 10^{-3} $. We find, for the first time, an
exclusive value which is compatible with the latest inclusive determination at
$1\sigma$ level. We address also the issue of Lepton Flavour Universality by
computing pure theoretical estimates of the $\tau/\ell$ ratios of the branching
fractions for each channel. In the case of a light spectator quark we obtain
$R(D^*) = 0.275(8)$ and $R(D) = 0.296(8)$, which are compatible with the
corresponding experimental values within $1.3\sigma$. In the case of a strange

lifting to generate 4D BEV representations from multi-timestamp and multi-view

for further feature extraction in BEV. Finally, multiple task decoders are

the grid sampler to generate BEV features with different ranges and

current paper mathematically analyzes a new mechanism of implicit
regularization in the EoS phase, whereby GD updates due to non-smooth loss
landscape turn out to evolve along some deterministic flow on the manifold of
minimum loss. This is in contrast to many previous results about implicit bias
either relying on infinitesimal updates or noise in gradient. Formally, for any
smooth function $L$ with certain regularity condition, this effect is
demonstrated for (1) Normalized GD, i.e., GD with a varying LR $\eta_t

loss $\sqrt{L- \min_x L(x)}$. Both provably enter the Edge of Stability, with
the associated flow on the manifold minimizing $\lambda_{1}(\nabla^2 L)$. The
above theoretical results have been corroborated by an experimental study.

processes that tie their rotation at birth to larger parent structures. We
present a new mechanism that describes how collections of particles or 'clouds'
gain a prograde rotational component when they collapse or contract while
subject to an external, central force. The effect is geometric in origin, as
relative shear on curved orbits moves their shared center-of-mass slightly
inward and toward the external potential during a collapse, exchanging orbital
angular momentum into aligned (prograde) rotation. We perform illustrative
analytical and N-body calculations to show that this process of prograde
spin-up proceeds quadratically in time ($\delta L_\mathrm{rot} \propto t^2$)
until the collapse nears completion. The total rotational gain increases with
the size of the cloud prior to its collapse: $\delta
L_\mathrm{rot}/L_\mathrm{H} \propto (R_\mathrm{cl}/R_\mathrm{H})^5$, and
typically with distance to the source of the potential ($L_\mathrm{H}\propto
r_0)$. For clouds that form at the interface of shear and self-gravity
($R_\mathrm{cl} \sim R_\mathrm{H}$), prograde spin-up means that even setups
with large initial retrograde rotation collapse to form prograde-spinning
objects. Being a geometric effect, prograde spin-up persists around any central
potential that triggers shear, even those where the shear is strongly
retrograde. We highlight an application to the Solar System, where prograde
spin-up can explain the frequency of binary objects in the Kuiper belt with
prograde rotation.

simulations of the CE interaction between a 1.7 $M_{\odot}$ AGB star and a 0.6

taken at the seventh thermal pulse. The interaction takes place when the giant

$R_{\odot}$. The post-CE orbital separations varies between 20 and 31
$R_{\odot}$, with the inclusion of recombination energy resulting in wider

thermal pulses can trigger CEs, extending the ability of AGB stars to capture
companions into CEs, that would lead to the prediction of a larger population
of post-AGB, post-CE binaries. Simulations that include a tabulated equation of
state unbind a great deal more gas, likely unbinding the entire envelope on
short time-scales. The shape of the CE after the in-spiral is more spherical

Paradigm that requires a pre-stated, fixed phase space. Therefore, the Second
Law of Thermodynamics, stated only for fixed phase spaces, is also in doubt.
The validity of the Newtonian Paradigm may stop at the onset of evolving life.
Living cells and organisms are Kantian Wholes that achieve constraint closure,
so do thermodynamic work to construct themselves. Evolution constructs an
ever-expanding phase space. Thus, we can ask the free energy cost per added
degree of freedom. That cost is roughly linear or sublinear in the mass
constructed. However, the resulting expansion of the phase space is
exponential. Thus, the evolving biosphere does thermodynamic work to construct
itself into an ever-smaller sub-domain of its ever-expanding phase space at
ever less free energy cost per added degree of freedom. Entropy really does
decrease.
  A testable implication of this, termed here the Fourth Law of Thermodynamics,
is that at constant energy input, the biosphere will construct itself into an
ever more localized subregion of its ever-expanding phase space. This is
confirmed. The energy input from the sun has been roughly constant for the 4
billion years since life started to evolve. The localization of our current
biosphere in its protein phase space is at least 10^-2540. The localization of
our biosphere with respect to molecules of CHNOPS comprised of up to 350,000
atoms is extremely high. Entropy has decreased. The universality of the Second

crucial role in driving galactic outflows and enriching the circumgalactic
medium with metals. To study this effect, we carry out high resolution dwarf
galaxy simulations that include velocity kicks to massive O/B stars above 8
M$_{\odot}$. We consider two scenarios, one that adopts a power law velocity
distribution for kick velocities, resulting in more stars with high velocity
kicks, and a more moderate scenario with a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We
explicitly resolve the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), and include
non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry channels. We adopt a resolved feedback
scheme (\textsc{Griffin}) where we sample individual massive stars from an IMF.
We follow the lifetime of these stars and add their photoionising radiation,
their UV radiation field, and their photoelectric heating rate to the
surrounding gas. At the end of their lifetime we explode the massive population
as core collapse supernovae (CCSN). In the simulations with runaway massive
stars, we add additional (natal) velocity kicks that mimic two and three body
interactions that cannot be fully resolved in our simulations. We find that the
inclusion of runaway or walkaway star scenarios has an impact on mass, metal,
momentum and energy outflows as well as the respective loading factors. We find
an increase in mass, metal and momentum loading by a factor of 2-3, whereas we
find an increase in the mean energy loading by a factor of 5 in the runaway
case and a factor of 3 in the walkaway case. However, we find that the peak
values are increased by a factor of up to 10, independent of the adopted

a hierarchy of simpler coherent features. DMD is regularly used to understand
the fundamental characteristics of turbulence and is closely related to Koopman
operators. However, verifying the decomposition, equivalently the computed
spectral features of Koopman operators, remains a major challenge due to the
infinite-dimensional nature of Koopman operators. Challenges include spurious
(unphysical) modes, and dealing with continuous spectra, both of which occur
regularly in turbulent flows. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD),
introduced by (Colbrook & Townsend 2021), overcomes some of these challenges
through the data-driven computation of residuals associated with the full
infinite-dimensional Koopman operator. ResDMD computes spectra and
pseudospectra of general Koopman operators with error control, and computes
smoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous spectra)
with explicit high-order convergence theorems. ResDMD thus provides robust and
verified Koopmanism. We implement ResDMD and demonstrate its application in a
variety of fluid dynamic situations, at varying Reynolds numbers, arising from
both numerical and experimental data. Examples include: vortex shedding behind
a cylinder; hot-wire data acquired in a turbulent boundary layer; particle
image velocimetry data focusing on a wall-jet flow; and acoustic pressure
signals of laser-induced plasma. We present some advantages of ResDMD, namely,
the ability to verifiably resolve non-linear, transient modes, and spectral
calculation with reduced broadening effects. We also discuss how a new modal
ordering based on residuals enables greater accuracy with a smaller dictionary

  This paper proposes \textsc{DynAnom}, an efficient framework to quantify the
changes and localize per-node anomalies over large dynamic weighted-graphs.
Thanks to recent advances in dynamic representation learning based on
Personalized PageRank, \textsc{DynAnom} is 1) \textit{efficient}: the time
complexity is linear to the number of edge events and independent on node size
of the input graph; 2) \textit{effective}: \textsc{DynAnom} can successfully

different type of anomaly score functions can be defined for various

  arXiv:2107.09650",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Assistive robot arms try to help their users perform everyday tasks. One way
robots can provide this assistance is shared autonomy. Within shared autonomy,
both the human and robot maintain control over the robot's motion: as the robot
becomes confident it understands what the human wants, it intervenes to
automate the task. But how does the robot know these tasks in the first place?
State-of-the-art approaches to shared autonomy often rely on prior knowledge.
For instance, the robot may need to know the human's potential goals
beforehand. During long-term interaction these methods will inevitable break
down -- sooner or later the human will attempt to perform a task that the robot
does not expect. Accordingly, in this paper we formulate an alternate approach
to shared autonomy that learns assistance from scratch. Our insight is that
operators repeat important tasks on a daily basis (e.g., opening the fridge,
making coffee). Instead of relying on prior knowledge, we therefore take
advantage of these repeated interactions to learn assistive policies. We
introduce SARI, an algorithm that recognizes the human's task, replicates
similar demonstrations, and returns control when unsure. We then combine
learning with control to demonstrate that the error of our approach is
uniformly ultimately bounded. We perform simulations to support this error
bound, compare our approach to imitation learning baselines, and explore its
capacity to assist for an increasing number of tasks. Finally, we conduct three
user studies with industry-standard methods and shared autonomy baselines,
including a pilot test with a disabled user. Our results indicate that learning
shared autonomy across repeated interactions matches existing approaches for
known tasks and outperforms baselines on new tasks. See videos of our user

correlation, i.e., some knowledge is spurious and not causally related to task
labels, but the model could mistakenly utilize them and thus fail when such
correlation changes. In MTL setup, there exist several unique challenges of
spurious correlation. First, the risk of having non-causal knowledge is higher,
as the shared MTL model needs to encode all knowledge from different tasks, and
causal knowledge for one task could be potentially spurious to the other.
Second, the confounder between task labels brings in a different type of
spurious correlation to MTL. We theoretically prove that MTL is more prone to
taking non-causal knowledge from other tasks than single-task learning, and
thus generalize worse. To solve this problem, we propose Multi-Task Causal
Representation Learning framework, aiming to represent multi-task knowledge via
disentangled neural modules, and learn which module is causally related to each

the system takes an orthorhombic Pnnm structure, possibly destroying the Dirac
cones due to the loss of the four-fold screw symmetry. In the tetragonal
structure, a gradual suppression of the transverse magneto-resistance and a
rapid change in the magnetic field dependence above 50K suggest possible
T-dependent Fermi surface modification. In the high pressure phase, the
metallic character increases marginally (as evident from the increased RRR
value) accompanied with suppressed magneto-resistance, without emergence of
superconductivity up to 20 GPa and down to 1.4K. Most surprisingly, upon
release of pressure to 0.2 GPa, a sharp resistance drop below 4K is observed,
field varying measurements confirm this as the onset of superconductivity. The
observed changes of the carrier density and mobility in the pressure-released
tetragonal phase indicate electronic structural modification resulting from the
irreversible polyhedral distortion. A simultaneous increase in the residual
resistivity and carrier density upon decompression indicates that an enhanced

between nearby elements of the RIS, the quantization levels of the reflection
coefficients, the interplay between the amplitude and phase of the reflection
coefficients, and the presence of electromagnetic interference. We consider
both case studies in which the users may be located in the far-field and
near-field regions of an RIS. Our study shows that, due to design constraints,
such as the need of using quantized reflection coefficients or the inherent
interplay between the phase and the amplitude of the reflection coefficients,
an RIS may reradiate power towards unwanted directions that depend on the
intended and interfering electromagnetic waves. Therefore, it is in general
important to optimize an RIS by considering the entire reradiation pattern by
design to maximize the reradiated power towards the desired directions of
reradiation while keeping the power reradiated towards other unwanted
directions at a low level. Our study shows that a 2-bit digitally controllable

Theory for deconvolution has mainly focused on kernel- or wavelet-based

smoothness-penalized estimator have been found to outperform kernel methods in
simulation studies. This paper fills in some of these gaps by establishing
asymptotic guarantees for the smoothness-penalized approach. Consistency is
established in mean integrated squared error, and rates of convergence are
derived for Gaussian, Cauchy, and Laplace error densities, attaining some lower
bounds already in the literature. The assumptions are weak for most results;
the estimator can be used with a broader class of error densities than the
deconvoluting kernel. Our application example estimates the density of the mean
cytotoxicity of certain bacterial isolates under random sampling; this mean
cytotoxicity can only be measured experimentally with additive error, leading
to the deconvolution problem. We also describe a method for approximating the
solution by a cubic spline, which reduces to a quadratic program.

this gap by approaching argument quality estimation from multiple different
angles: Grounded on rich results from thorough empirical evaluations, we assess
the generalization capabilities of argument quality estimation across diverse
domains, the interplay with related argument mining tasks, and the impact of
emotions on perceived argument strength. We find that generalization depends on
a sufficient representation of different domains in the training part. In
zero-shot transfer and multi-task experiments, we reveal that argument quality
is among the more challenging tasks but can improve others. Finally, we show
that emotions play a minor role in argument quality than is often assumed.

telescope, towards the dust peak and the respective molecular peaks of L1544.
With non-LTE radiative transfer calculations and a 1-dimensional model, we
revisit the physical structure of L1544, and benchmark with the abundance

from $\sim$10$^{4}$ to several times 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Particularly, we find
that to produce the observed intensities and ratios of the CH$_{3}$OH lines, a
local gas density enhancement upon the BE sphere is required. This suggests
that the physical structure of an early-stage core may not necessarily follow a
smooth decrease of gas density profile locally, but can be intercepted by
clumpy substructures surrounding the gravitational center. Multiple transitions
of molecular lines from different molecular species can provide a tomographic

Despite its importance, calibration optimization often suffers from a problem

maximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is
introduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the
prediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions can be
achieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the

Overall, we find surprisingly good agreement between all methods but that
accounting for phonon anharmonicity is important for accurate prediction of

qualitative temperature dependence. For the model studied, phonon lifetime
effects have relatively little impact on carrier transport, but the effective

From plasma physics theory, the characteristics of the waves and their

among other factors. In the case of the Earth's magnetosphere, the plasma is
usually composed by electrons, protons, O+, and He+ ions, all with their
particular properties and characteristics. Here, using plasma parameters
relevant for the inner magnetosphere we study the dispersion properties of

dispersion properties of KAW, such as polarization, compressibility, and
electric-to-magnetic amplitude ratio, and therefore the propagation of Kinetic
Alfv\'en Waves is highly determined by the relative abundance of He+ and O+ in
the plasma. These results when discussed in the context of observations in the

Al-Fe-Y, is investigated with in-situ micropillar compression testing. Both
alloys were strengthened by a hierarchical microstructure including grain
boundary segregation, nanometer-thick amorphous complexions, carbide nanorod
precipitates with sizes of a few nanometers, and submicron-scale intermetallic
particles. The maximum yield strength of the Al-Mg-Y system is measured to be
950 MPa, exceeding that of the Al-Fe-Y system (680 MPa), primarily due to a
combination of more carbide nanorods and more amorphous complexions. Both
alloys exhibited yield strengths much higher than those of commercial Al
alloys, and therefore have great potential for structural applications.
However, some micropillar specimens were observed to plastically soften through
shear banding. Post-mortem investigation revealed that intermetallic-free
deformation pathways of a few micrometers in length were responsible for this
failure. Further characterization showed significant grain growth within the
shear band. The coarsened grains maintained the same orientation with each
other, pointing to grain boundary mechanisms for plastic flow, specifically
grain rotation and/or grain boundary migration. The presence of intermetallic
particles makes it difficult for both matrix and intermetallic grains to rotate
into the same orientation due to the different lattice parameters and slip
systems. Therefore, we are able to conclude that a uniform distribution of
intermetallic particles with an average spacing less than the percolation
length of shear localization can effectively prevent the maturation of shear
bands, offering a design strategy for high-strength nanocrystalline Al alloys
with both high strength and stable plastic flow.

networks that is rooted in the inherent uncertainty of travel times. Travel
times are subject to stochastic uncertainty resulting from various parameters
such as weather condition, occurrences of road works, or traffic accidents.
Large mobility services have an informational advantage over single network
users as they are able to learn traffic conditions from data. A benevolent
mobility service may use this informational advantage in order to steer the
traffic equilibrium into a favorable direction. The resulting optimization
problem is a task commonly referred to as signaling or Bayesian persuasion.
Previous work has shown that the underlying signaling problem can be NP-hard to
approximate within any non-trivial bounds, even for affine cost functions with
stochastic offsets. In contrast, we show that in this case, the signaling
problem is easy for many networks. We tightly characterize the class of
single-commodity networks, in which full information revelation is always an
optimal signaling strategy. Moreover, we construct a reduction from optimal
signaling to computing an optimal collection of support vectors for the Wardrop
equilibrium. For two states, this insight can be used to compute an optimal
signaling scheme. The algorithm runs in polynomial time whenever the number of
different supports resulting from any signal distribution is bounded to a
polynomial in the input size. Using a cell decomposition technique, we extend
the approach to a polynomial-time algorithm for multi-commodity parallel link
networks with a constant number of commodities, even when we have a constant
number of different states of nature.

2017], generalizes the classic Monge-Kantorovich framework by allowing the
transport cost between one point and the points it is matched with to be
nonlinear. In the so-called barycentric version of WOT, the cost for
transporting a point $x$ only depends on $x$ and on the barycenter of the
points it is matched with. This aggregation property of WOT is appealing in
machine learning, economics and finance. Yet algorithms to compute WOT have
only been developed for the special case of quadratic barycentric WOT, or
depend on neural networks with no guarantee on the computed value and matching.
The main difficulty lies in the transportation constraints which are costly to
project onto. In this paper, we propose to use mirror descent algorithms to
solve the primal and dual versions of the WOT problem. We also apply our
algorithms to the variant of WOT introduced by [Chon\'e et al., 2022] where
mass is distributed from one space to another through unnormalized kernels

$\operatorname{argmax}_X \sum_Y f(X, Y)$, where $f$ is a real-valued function

request a value assignment for the $X$ variables that maximizes the weighted

been shown to be a promising approach to formally verify fairness in supervised

approach to interrogate brain function in research, and an essential part of

neural populations is possible because high dimensional neural population
activity typically occupies low dimensional manifolds that are discoverable
with suitable latent variable models. Over time however, drifts in activity of
individual neurons and instabilities in neural recording devices can be
substantial, making stable decoding over days and weeks impractical. While this
drift cannot be predicted on an individual neuron level, population level
variations over consecutive recording sessions such as differing sets of
neurons and varying permutations of consistent neurons in recorded data may be
learnable when the underlying manifold is stable over time. Classification of
consistent versus unfamiliar neurons across sessions and accounting for
deviations in the order of consistent recording neurons in recording datasets
over sessions of recordings may then maintain decoding performance. In this
work we show that self-supervised training of a deep neural network can be used
to compensate for this inter-session variability. As a result, a sequential
autoencoding model can maintain state-of-the-art behaviour decoding performance
for completely unseen recording sessions several days into the future. Our
approach only requires a single recording session for training the model, and

readers alike, providing answers to questions that cannot, or cannot easily, be
found in texts. Recent work has designed special models and training paradigms
for table-related tasks such as table-based question answering and table
retrieval. Though effective, they add complexity in both modeling and data
acquisition compared to generic text solutions and obscure which elements are
truly beneficial. In this work, we focus on the task of table retrieval, and
ask: ""is table-specific model design necessary for table retrieval, or can a
simpler text-based model be effectively used to achieve a similar result?""
First, we perform an analysis on a table-based portion of the Natural Questions
dataset (NQ-table), and find that structure plays a negligible role in more
than 70% of the cases. Based on this, we experiment with a general Dense
Passage Retriever (DPR) based on text and a specialized Dense Table Retriever
(DTR) that uses table-specific model designs. We find that DPR performs well
without any table-specific design and training, and even achieves superior
results compared to DTR when fine-tuned on properly linearized tables. We then
experiment with three modules to explicitly encode table structures, namely
auxiliary row/column embeddings, hard attention masks, and soft relation-based
attention biases. However, none of these yielded significant improvements,
suggesting that table-specific model design may not be necessary for table
retrieval.

ventilation strategy for critically ill patients remains a major challenge.
Recently, dynamic treatment regime (DTR) with reinforcement learning (RL) on
electronic health records (EHR) has attracted interest from both the healthcare
industry and machine learning research community. However, most learned DTR
policies might be biased due to the existence of confounders. Although some
treatment actions non-survivors received may be helpful, if confounders cause
the mortality, the training of RL models guided by long-term outcomes (e.g.,
90-day mortality) would punish those treatment actions causing the learned DTR
policies to be suboptimal. In this study, we develop a new deconfounding
actor-critic network (DAC) to learn optimal DTR policies for patients. To
alleviate confounding issues, we incorporate a patient resampling module and a
confounding balance module into our actor-critic framework. To avoid punishing
the effective treatment actions non-survivors received, we design a short-term
reward to capture patients' immediate health state changes. Combining
short-term with long-term rewards could further improve the model performance.
Moreover, we introduce a policy adaptation method to successfully transfer the
learned model to new-source small-scale datasets. The experimental results on
one semi-synthetic and two different real-world datasets show the proposed
model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. The proposed model provides
individualized treatment decisions for mechanical ventilation that could

current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models tends to be poor and
generalization beyond the training data is difficult. Furthermore, existing
prediction frameworks are typically not capable of simultaneously handling
other video-related tasks such as unconditional generation or interpolation. In
this work, we devise a general-purpose framework called Masked Conditional
Video Diffusion (MCVD) for all of these video synthesis tasks using a
probabilistic conditional score-based denoising diffusion model, conditioned on
past and/or future frames. We train the model in a manner where we randomly and
independently mask all the past frames or all the future frames. This novel but
straightforward setup allows us to train a single model that is capable of
executing a broad range of video tasks, specifically: future/past prediction --
when only future/past frames are masked; unconditional generation -- when both
past and future frames are masked; and interpolation -- when neither past nor
future frames are masked. Our experiments show that this approach can generate
high-quality frames for diverse types of videos. Our MCVD models are built from
simple non-recurrent 2D-convolutional architectures, conditioning on blocks of
frames and generating blocks of frames. We generate videos of arbitrary lengths
autoregressively in a block-wise manner. Our approach yields SOTA results

spikes from one spike train to the next, either caused by response onset
fluctuations or by finite propagation speed. Such systematic shifts in spike
timing lead to a spurious decrease in synchrony which needs to be corrected.
New Method: We propose a new algorithm of multivariate latency correction
suitable for sparse data for which the relevant information is not primarily in
the rate but in the timing of each individual spike. The algorithm is designed
to correct systematic delays while maintaining all other kinds of noisy
disturbances. It consists of two steps, spike matching and distance
minimization between the matched spikes using simulated annealing. Results: We
show its effectiveness on simulated and real data: cortical propagation
patterns recorded via calcium imaging from mice before and after stroke. Using
simulations of these data we also establish criteria that can be evaluated
beforehand in order to anticipate whether our algorithm is likely to yield a
considerable improvement for a given dataset. Comparison with Existing
Method(s): Existing methods of latency correction rely on adjusting peaks in
rate profiles, an approach that is not feasible for spike trains with low
firing in which the timing of individual spikes contains essential information.
Conclusions: For any given dataset the criterion for applicability of the
algorithm can be evaluated quickly and in case of a positive outcome the
latency correction can be applied easily since the source codes of the
algorithm are publicly available.

189733 b); a mini-Neptune around an early-M dwarf (K2-18 b); and terrestrial
planets around a late M dwarf (TRAPPIST-1). We map photospheres with
temperatures and radial velocities (RV) and integrate specific intensity
stellar models. We obtain transit spectra affected by stellar contamination,
the Rossiter--McLaughlin effect (RME), and center-to-limb variations (CLV). We
find that, at low resolution, for later-type stars, planetary water features
become difficult to distinguish from contamination. Many distributions of
unocculted active regions can induce planetary-like features of similar
amplitudes in the case of a late M dwarf. Atmospheric characterization of
planets around late-type stars will likely continue to suffer from degeneracy
with stellar activity unless active regions' parameters can be constrained
using additional information. For the early-K star, stellar contamination
mostly manifests itself through a slope at optical wavelengths similar to
Rayleigh scattering. In all cases, contamination induces offsets in measured
planet radii. At high resolution, we show that we can determine the origin of
$\text{H}_2$O and CO detection signals and lift the degeneracy observed at low
resolution, provided sufficient planet RV variation during transit and adequate
correction for the RME and CLV when required. High-resolution spectroscopy may
therefore help resolve issues arising from stellar contamination for favorable
systems.

social network activity may be heightened during certain hours of day. In this
paper, our main interest is to model recurrent activity in such temporal
networks. As a starting point we use stochastic block model, a popular choice
for modelling static networks, where nodes are split into $R$ groups. We extend
this model to temporal networks by modelling the edges with a Poisson process.
We make the parameters of the process dependent on time by segmenting the time
line into $K$ segments. To enforce the recurring activity we require that only
$H < K$ different set of parameters can be used, that is, several, not
necessarily consecutive, segments must share their parameters. We prove that
the searching for optimal blocks and segmentation is an NP-hard problem.
Consequently, we split the problem into 3 subproblems where we optimize blocks,
model parameters, and segmentation in turn while keeping the remaining
structures fixed. We propose an iterative algorithm that requires $O(KHm + Rn +
R^2H)$ time per iteration, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes and edges
in the network. We demonstrate experimentally that the number of required
iterations is typically low, the algorithm is able to discover the ground truth
from synthetic datasets, and show that certain real-world networks exhibit
recurrent behaviour as the likelihood does not deteriorate when $H$ is lowered.

these approaches have two limitations: 1) they fail to leverage item linkage

we report our (grand prize-winning) solution to the National Assessment of

applications/services, many of which are delay-sensitive. In this paper, we
propose a service delay efficient FL (SDEFL) scheme over mobile devices. Unlike
traditional communication efficient FL, which regards wireless communications
as the bottleneck, we find that under many situations, the local computing
delay is comparable to the communication delay during the FL training process,
given the development of high-speed wireless transmission techniques. Thus, the
service delay in FL should be computing delay + communication delay over
training rounds. To minimize the service delay of FL, simply reducing local
computing/communication delay independently is not enough. The delay trade-off
between local computing and wireless communications must be considered.
Besides, we empirically study the impacts of local computing control and
compression strategies (i.e., the number of local updates, weight quantization,
and gradient quantization) on computing, communication and service delays.
Based on those trade-off observation and empirical studies, we develop an
optimization scheme to minimize the service delay of FL over heterogeneous
devices. We establish testbeds and conduct extensive emulations/experiments to
verify our theoretical analysis. The results show that SDEFL reduces notable
service delay with a small accuracy drop compared to peer designs.

transformer overload in distribution grids, calling for recovering
meter-transformer mapping to provide situational awareness, i.e., the
transformer loading. The challenge lies in recovering meter-transformer (M.T.)
mapping for two common scenarios, e.g., large distances between a meter and its
parent transformer or high similarity of a meter's consumption pattern to a
non-parent transformer's meters. Past methods either assume a variety of data
as in the transmission grid or ignore the two common scenarios mentioned above.
Therefore, we propose to utilize the above observation via spectral embedding
by using the property that inter-transformer meter consumptions are not the
same and that the noise in data is limited so that all the k smallest
eigenvalues of the voltage-based Laplacian matrix are smaller than the next
smallest eigenvalue of the ideal Laplacian matrix. We also provide a guarantee
based on this understanding. Furthermore, we partially relax the assumption by
utilizing location information to aid voltage information for areas

which gadolinium (Gd) sulfate octahydrate was added to the water in the
detector, enhancing the efficiency to detect thermal neutrons and consequently
improving the sensitivity to low energy electron anti-neutrinos from inverse
beta decay (IBD) interactions. SK-Gd has the potential to provide early alerts
of incipient core-collapse supernovae through detection of electron
anti-neutrinos from thermal and nuclear processes responsible for the cooling
of massive stars before the gravitational collapse of their cores. These
pre-supernova neutrinos emitted during the silicon burning phase can exceed the
energy threshold for IBD reactions. We present the sensitivity of SK-Gd to
pre-supernova stars and the techniques used for the development of a
pre-supernova alarm based on the detection of these neutrinos in SK, as well as
prospects for future SK-Gd phases with higher concentrations of Gd. For the
current SK-Gd phase, high-confidence alerts for Betelgeuse could be issued up
to nine hours in advance of the core-collapse itself.

different anomalies within a time series usually have diverse profiles

computational algebra. Since Buchberger's algorithm for computing Gr\""obner
bases in the 60s, there has been a lot of progress in this domain. Moreover,
these equations have been employed to model and solve problems from diverse
disciplines such as biology, cryptography, and robotics. Currently, we have a
good understanding of how to solve generic systems from a theoretical and
algorithmic point of view. However, polynomial equations encountered in
practice are usually structured, and so many properties and results about
generic systems do not apply to them. For this reason, a common trend in the
last decades has been to develop mathematical and algorithmic frameworks to
exploit specific structures of systems of polynomials.
  Arguably, the most common structure is sparsity; that is, the polynomials of
the systems only involve a few monomials. Since Bernstein, Khovanskii, and
Kushnirenko's work on the expected number of solutions of sparse systems, toric
geometry has been the default mathematical framework to employ sparsity. In
particular, it is the crux of the matter behind the extension of classical
tools to systems, such as resultant computations, homotopy continuation
methods, and most recently, Gr\""obner bases. In this work, we will review these
classical tools, their extensions, and recent progress in exploiting sparsity

Fermi surfaces. In two dimensions they may carry a static dipole moment that is
transverse to their momentum which is quantum geometric in nature, the quantum
geometric dipole (QGD). We show that this property is also realized for such
materials confined in nanowire geometries. Focusing on the gapless,
intra-subband plasmon excitations, we compute the transverse dipole moment Dx
of the modes for a variety of situations. We find that single chiral fermions
generically host non-vanishing Dx, even when there is no intrinsic gap in the
two-dimensional spectrum, for which the corresponding two-dimensional QGD
vanishes. In the limit of very wide wires, the transverse dipole moment of the
highest velocity plasmon mode matches onto the two-dimensional QGD. Plasmons of
multi-valley systems that are time-reversal symmetric have vanishing transverse
dipole moment, but can be made to carry non-vanishing values by breaking the
valley symmetry, for example via magnetic field. The presence of a
non-vanishing transverse dipole moment for nanowire plasmons in principle
offers the possibility of continuously controlling their energies and
velocities by the application of a static transverse electric field.

mixing in the stellar interior. In this analysis, we investigate the ability of
thermohaline mixing to explain the observed timing of these chemical depletion
events. Recent observational measurements of lithium and [C/N] show that the
abundance of lithium decreases before the abundance of [C/N], whereas numerical
simulations of the propagation of the thermohaline mixing region computed with
MESA show that the synthetic abundances drop simultaneously. We therefore
conclude that thermohaline mixing alone cannot explain the distinct events of
lithium depletion and [C/N] depletion, as the simultaneity predicted by
simulations is not consistent with the observation of separate drops. We thus
invite more sophisticated theoretical explanations for the observed temporal
separation of these chemical depletion episodes as well as more extensive
observational explorations across a range of masses and metallicities.

Poisson intensities and the median of the size distribution vary spatially in
terms of fixed and random effects, with shared spatial components capturing
cross-correlation between landslide counts and sizes. We robustly model spatial
dependence using intrinsic conditional autoregressive priors. Our novel models
are fitted efficiently using a customized adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo

provide improved predictions of large landslide sizes compared to more

technology have important significance. Considering that NOMA technology has
deeper requirements for the modulation classification of mixed signals under

seen although the time and space complexity of these algorithms have increased,
different deep learning models have different effects on the modulation

different explosion mechanisms can significantly affect the results of

hydrodynamical ejecta interactions with a main-sequence (MS) donor star in two
dimensions for two near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models of SNe Ia, the W7

explosion in simulations with the W7 deflagration and N100 delayed-detonation

transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset. This offset is
implicitly absorbed in the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The
diversity of CPD kernels allows us to derive various RPEs that enable length

separated into long-term and short-term components in a stepwise manner, and
the two components are trained independently to improve the inference

critical since labeled samples are usually scarce in real-world scenarios.
Existing approaches mainly leverage the contrastive learning framework, which

Nevertheless, they are restricted to the prior knowledge of constructing pairs,
cumbersome sampling policy, and unstable performances when encountering
sampling bias. Also, few works have focused on effectively modeling across
temporal-spectral relations to extend the capacity of representations. In this
paper, we aim at learning representations for time series from a new
perspective and propose Cross Reconstruction Transformer (CRT) to solve the
aforementioned problems in a unified way. CRT achieves time series
representation learning through a cross-domain dropping-reconstruction task.
Specifically, we transform time series into the frequency domain and randomly
drop certain parts in both time and frequency domains. Dropping can maximally
preserve the global context compared to cropping and masking. Then a
transformer architecture is utilized to adequately capture the cross-domain
correlations between temporal and spectral information through reconstructing
data in both domains, which is called Dropped Temporal-Spectral Modeling. To
discriminate the representations in global latent space, we propose Instance
Discrimination Constraint to reduce the mutual information between different
time series and sharpen the decision boundaries. Additionally, we propose a
specified curriculum learning strategy to optimize the CRT, which progressively
increases the dropping ratio in the training process.

operationalize the proposed fork entropy based on Rao's quadratic entropy with
a distance function defined on the forks' modifications to project files. After
verifying the construct validity of fork entropy, we show the usefulness of
fork entropy in understanding and predicting OSS development in terms of
external productivity, the acceptance rate of external pull-requests, and code
quality using a dataset consisting of fifty popular OSS projects hosted on

significantly and positively affects external productivity, the acceptance rate
of external pull-requests, and code quality, even though sometimes with a small
effect. However, as expected, fork entropy at a high level sometimes plays a
negative role in OSS development. We also observe fork entropy can magically
moderate other factors' effect on some project outcomes. We believe our new
metric of fork entropy is helpful to guide practices of OSS development.

existing pattern-based approaches are limited in supporting quantitative
analysis, and are potentially problematic for using the patterns in a mutually

that different patterns can occur simultaneously between every pair of
communities during the evolution, just in different degrees. Four entropy-based
indices are devised to measure the degree of community split, shrink, merge,
and expand, respectively, which can provide a comprehensive and quantitative
measure of community evolution in DSNs. The indices have properties desirable
to quantify community evolution including monotonicity, and bounded maximum and
minimum values that correspond to meaningful cases. They can also be combined
to describe more patterns such as community emerge and extinct. We conduct
experiments with real-world OSS projects to evaluate the validity of the
proposed indices. The results suggest the proposed indices can effectively
capture community evolution, and are consistent with existing approaches in
detecting evolution patterns in DSNs with an accuracy of 94.1\%. The results
also show that the indices are useful in predicting OSS team productivity with

stability and the Hawking-Page phase transition of the Schwarzschild AdS black
hole by employing an alternative local temperature satisfying the
Hartle-Hawking vacuum condition which states that the ingoing and outgoing
fluxes vanish at the horizon so that the local temperature is naturally zero
there. The different definition of the local temperature based on the stress
tensor approach provides different types of stability and phase transition. For
a AdS curvature radius below a critical one, the medium-sized black hole is
found to be stable and the other small and large black holes turn out to be
unstable regardless of the AdS curvature radius. Furthermore, we encounter
various critical temperatures. The first one is for the Hawking-Page phase
transition between the medium-sized black hole and thermal AdS, and the second
one is for a phase transition between the large black hole and thermal AdS;
however, the latter one is not essential because the large black hole and
thermal AdS eventually collapse to the medium-sized black hole. Interestingly,

reduction versus NLSE and an 87% reduction versus RNN without accuracy
deterioration. In addition, the input pulse conditions, including grid point
numbers, durations, peak powers, and propagation distance, can be flexibly
changed during the predicting process. The results represent a remarkable

efficient and valid prediction intervals (PIs) for regression on
cross-sectional time series data. Such data is common in many domains,
including econometrics and healthcare. A canonical example in healthcare is
predicting patient outcomes using physiological time-series data, where a
population of patients composes a cross-section. Reliable PI estimators in this
setting must address two distinct notions of coverage: cross-sectional coverage
across a cross-sectional slice, and longitudinal coverage along the temporal
dimension for each time series. Recent works have explored adapting Conformal
Prediction (CP) to obtain PIs in the time series context. However, none handles
both notions of coverage simultaneously. CP methods typically query a
pre-specified quantile from the distribution of nonconformity scores on a
calibration set. TQA adjusts the quantile to query in CP at each time $t$,
accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage in a
theoretically-grounded manner. The post-hoc nature of TQA facilitates its use
as a general wrapper around any time series regression model. We validate TQA's
performance through extensive experimentation: TQA generally obtains efficient
PIs and improves longitudinal coverage while preserving cross-sectional
coverage.

supermassive central black holes (SMBH) is modeled by high-accuracy direct
N-body simulation. Stars getting too close to the SMBH are tidally disrupted
and a tidal disruption event (TDE) happens. TDEs probe properties of SMBH,
their accretion disks, and the surrounding nuclear stellar cluster. In this
paper we compare rates of full tidal disruption events (FTDE) with partial
tidal disruption events (PTDE). Since a PTDE does not destroy the star, a
leftover object emerges; we use the term 'leftover star' for it; two novel
effects occur in the simulation: (1) variation of the leftover star's mass and
radius, (2) variation of the leftover star's orbital energy. After switching on
these two effects in our simulation, the number of FTDEs is reduced by roughly
28%, and the reduction is mostly due to the ejection of the leftover stars from
PTDEs coming originally from relatively large distance. The number of PTDEs is
about 75% higher than the simple estimation given by Stone et al. (2020), and
the enhancement is mainly due to the multiple PTDEs produced by the leftover
stars residing in the diffusive regime. We compute the peak mass fallback rate
for the PTDEs and FTDEs recorded in the simulation, and find 58% of the PTDEs
have peak mass fallback rate exceeding the Eddington limit, and the number of
super-Eddington PTDEs is 2.3 times the number of super-Eddington FTDEs.

social relations is a common use case in web-based systems. These connections
can be naturally represented as graph-structured data and thus utilizing graph
neural networks (GNNs) for social recommendation has become a promising
research direction. However, existing graph-based methods fails to consider the
bias offsets of users (items). For example, a low rating from a fastidious user
may not imply a negative attitude toward this item because the user tends to
assign low ratings in common cases. Such statistics should be considered into
the graph modeling procedure. While some past work considers the biases, we
argue that these proposed methods only treat them as scalars and can not
capture the complete bias information hidden in data. Besides, social
connections between users should also be differentiable so that users with
similar item preference would have more influence on each other. To this end,
we propose Graph-Based Decentralized Collaborative Filtering for Social
Recommendation (GDSRec). GDSRec treats the biases as vectors and fuses them
into the process of learning user and item representations. The statistical
bias offsets are captured by decentralized neighborhood aggregation while the
social connection strength is defined according to the preference similarity
and then incorporated into the model design. We conduct extensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.
Experimental results show that the proposed GDSRec achieves superior
performance compared with state-of-the-art related baselines. Our

applications, and they can be relatively easily realized by modifying ideal
structures with bound states in the continuum (BICs). When an ideal photonic
structure with a BIC is perturbed, the BIC may be destroyed (becomes a resonant
state) or may continue to exist with a slightly different frequency and a
slightly different wavevector (if appropriate). Some BICs are robust against
certain structural perturbations, but most BICs are nonrobust. Recent studies
suggest that a nonnegative integer $n$ can be defined for any generic
nondegenerate BIC with respect to a properly defined set of structural
perturbations. The integer $n$ is the minimum number of tunable parameters
needed to preserve the BIC for perturbations arbitrarily chosen from the set.
Robust and nonrobust BICs have $n=0$ and $n\ge 1$, respectively. A larger $n$
implies that the BIC is more difficult to find. If a structure is given by $m$
real parameters, the integer $n$ is the codimension of a geometric object
formed by the parameter values at which the BIC exists in the $m$-dimensional
parameter space. In this paper, we suggest a formula for $n$, give some
justification for the general case, calculate $n$ for different types of BICs
in two-dimensional structures with a single periodic direction, and illustrate
the results by numerical examples. Our study improves the theoretical
understanding on BICs and provides useful guidance to their practical
applications.

cycles on rotation rate can be a manifestation of a stronger dependence on the
effective temperature. Observational evidence is recalled and theoretical
arguments are given for the presence of cyclic activity in the case of
sufficiently slow rotation only. Slow rotation means proximity to the observed
upper bound on the rotation period of solar-type stars. This maximum rotation
period depends on temperature and shortens for hotter stars. The maximum
rotation period is interpreted as the minimum rotation rate for operation of a
large-scale dynamo. A combined model for differential rotation and the dynamo
is applied to stars of different mass rotating with a rate slightly above the
threshold rate for the dynamo. Computations show shorter dynamo cycles for
hotter stars. As the hotter stars rotate faster, the computed cycles are also
shorter for faster rotation. The observed smaller upper bound for rotation
period of hotter stars can be explained by the larger threshold amplitude of
the $\alpha$-effect for onset of their dynamos: a larger $\alpha$ demands
faster rotation. The amplitude of the (cycling) magnetic energy in the
computations is proportional to the difference between the rotation period and
its upper bound for the dynamo. Stars with moderately different rotation rates
can differ significantly in super-criticality of their dynamos and therefore in
their magnetic activity, as observed.

the proposed module would not infer frame attention and modality attention
independently. Instead, by casting the relationship between the modality
attention and the frame attention as an attention assignment process, the
structured attention composition module learns to encode the frame-modality
structure and uses it to regularize the inferred frame attention and modality
attention, respectively, upon the optimal transport theory. The final
frame-modality attention is obtained by the composition of the two individual
attentions. The proposed structured attention composition module can be
deployed as a plug-and-play module into existing action localization
frameworks. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that the
proposed structured attention composition consistently improves four
state-of-the-art temporal action localization methods and builds new
state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14. Code is availabel at

large-scale power leakage), we require reionisation simulations larger than the
experiments primary field of view. For an experiment such as the MWA, with a

several Gpcs, which is currently infeasible. To overcome this, we developed a
simplified version of the semi-numerical reionisation simulation code 21CMFAST

the pipelines for the 2020 MWA 21-cm power spectrum (PS) upper limits (Trott et

non-Gaussianity in estimates of the cosmic variance, (iii) biases in the

tiling smaller volume simulations to achieve extremely large volumes. In

sampling, neighborhood grouping, neighborhood-wise feature learning, and
feature aggregation to learn high-semantic point features that represent the
global context of a point cloud. Unfortunately, the compounded loss of
information concerning granularity and non-maximum point features due to
sampling and max pooling could adversely affect the high-semantic point
features from existing networks such that they are insufficient to represent
the local context of a point cloud, which in turn may hinder the network in
distinguishing fine shapes. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel point
cloud feature learning network, PointStack, using multi-resolution feature
learning and learnable pooling (LP). The multi-resolution feature learning is
realized by aggregating point features of various resolutions in the multiple
layers, so that the final point features contain both high-semantic and
high-resolution information. On the other hand, the LP is used as a generalized
pooling function that calculates the weighted sum of multi-resolution point
features through the attention mechanism with learnable queries, in order to
extract all possible information from all available point features.
Consequently, PointStack is capable of extracting high-semantic point features
with minimal loss of information concerning granularity and non-maximum point
features. Therefore, the final aggregated point features can effectively
represent both global and local contexts of a point cloud. In addition, both
the global structure and the local shape details of a point cloud can be well
comprehended by the network head, which enables PointStack to advance the

\textit{data-driven algorithm design} and evaluate the
\textit{pseudo-dimension} of a class of utility functions that measure the
performance of parameterized algorithms. Assuming that a vertex set of size $n$
is fixed, we present $\mathrm{O}(n\lg n)$ and $\mathrm{O}(n^2\lg n)$ upper
bounds on the pseudo-dimensions for GBFS and A*, respectively, parameterized by
heuristic function values. The upper bound for A* can be improved to
$\mathrm{O}(n^2\lg d)$ if every vertex has a degree of at most $d$ and to
$\mathrm{O}(n \lg n)$ if edge weights are integers bounded by
$\mathrm{poly}(n)$. We also give $\Omega(n)$ lower bounds for GBFS and A*,

examples, is gaining increasing attention due to the significant reduction in
labor cost. A typical FFG pipeline considers characters in a standard font
library as content glyphs and transfers them to a new target font by extracting
style information from the reference glyphs. Most existing solutions explicitly
disentangle content and style of reference glyphs globally or component-wisely.
However, the style of glyphs mainly lies in the local details, i.e. the styles
of radicals, components, and strokes together depict the style of a glyph.
Therefore, even a single character can contain different styles distributed
over spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a new font generation
approach by learning 1) the fine-grained local styles from references, and 2)
the spatial correspondence between the content and reference glyphs. Therefore,
each spatial location in the content glyph can be assigned with the right
fine-grained style. To this end, we adopt cross-attention over the
representation of the content glyphs as the queries and the representations of
the reference glyphs as the keys and values. Instead of explicitly
disentangling global or component-wise modeling, the cross-attention mechanism
can attend to the right local styles in the reference glyphs and aggregate the
reference styles into a fine-grained style representation for the given content
glyphs. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in FFG. In particular, the user studies also
demonstrate the style consistency of our approach significantly outperforms
previous methods.

learning (ML) models. The interpretability of decision trees motivates
explainability approaches by so-called intrinsic interpretability, and it is at
the core of recent proposals for applying interpretable ML models in high-risk
applications. The belief in DT interpretability is justified by the fact that
explanations for DT predictions are generally expected to be succinct. Indeed,
in the case of DTs, explanations correspond to DT paths. Since decision trees
are ideally shallow, and so paths contain far fewer features than the total
number of features, explanations in DTs are expected to be succinct, and hence
interpretable. This paper offers both theoretical and experimental arguments
demonstrating that, as long as interpretability of decision trees equates with
succinctness of explanations, then decision trees ought not be deemed
interpretable. The paper introduces logically rigorous path explanations and
path explanation redundancy, and proves that there exist functions for which
decision trees must exhibit paths with arbitrarily large explanation
redundancy. The paper also proves that only a very restricted class of
functions can be represented with DTs that exhibit no explanation redundancy.
In addition, the paper includes experimental results substantiating that path
explanation redundancy is observed ubiquitously in decision trees, including
those obtained using different tree learning algorithms, but also in a wide
range of publicly available decision trees. The paper also proposes
polynomial-time algorithms for eliminating path explanation redundancy, which
in practice require negligible time to compute. Thus, these algorithms serve to
indirectly attain irreducible, and so succinct, explanations for decision
trees.

$O(100~{\rm Hz})$ for SNR 10. (iii) The remnant's time of collapse to black

can be biased by noise fluctuationsif the latter exceed the signal's amplitude

be detected at SNR $\gtrsim 8$ if the frequency shifts are $\gtrsim 500~{\rm

However, the $f_2$ measurement can be significantly biased by subdominant

dwarf (WD). However, the X-ray luminosity producing by the wind accretion of

work, we propose an alternative model to account for the observed X-ray
luminosity. If the WD was surrounded by a debris disk, the accretion from the
debris disk can produce the observed X-ray luminosity and X-ray pulses. Based
on the time-varying accretion rate model, the current mass of the debris disk
is constrained to be $3.9\times10^{-6}~\rm M_{\odot}$. Comparing with the
contraction of the WD, the accretion torque exerting by such a debris disk can
only influence the spin evolution of the WD in the early stage. According to
the accretion theory, the magnetic field of the WD is constrained to be $\sim
(0.7-7)\times10^{4}$ G. The calculated conventional polar cap radius of the WD
is larger than the observed emitting-zone radius, which probably originate from
the existence of strong and small-scale local magnetic field in the polar cap
surface. We expect that further multiband observations on this source can help
us to confirm or rule out the existence of a debris disk.

time equations, but is inspired from the Lax-Wendroff approach with the proper
level of implicit treatment of the source term. As a result, it yields a very
compact stencil in space and time and we are able to rigorously show that both
the second-order accuracy and the stability conditions are independent of the
fast scales in the asymptotic regime, including the study of boundary
conditions. We provide an original derivation of l 2 and l $\infty$ stability
conditions of the scheme that do not deteriorate the second order accuracy
without relying on a limiter of any type in the linear case, in particular for
shock solutions, and extend such results to the nonlinear case, showing the
novelty of the method. The prototype system for the linear case is the
hyperbolic heat equation, whereas barotropic Euler equations of gas dynamics
with friction are the one for the nonlinear case. The method is also able to
yield very accurate steady solutions in the nonlinear case when the relaxation
coefficient in the source term depends on space. A thorough numerical
assessment of the proposed strategy is provided by investigating smooth
solutions, solutions with shocks and solutions leading to a steady state with
space dependent relaxation coefficient.

application scenarios where the labeled data is limited and costly. Recently,
few-shot learning (FSL) gained increasing attention because of its
generalizability of prior knowledge to new tasks that contain only a few
samples. However, for data-intensive models such as vision transformer (ViT),
current fine-tuning based FSL approaches are inefficient in knowledge
generalization and thus degenerate the downstream task performances. In this
paper, we propose a novel mask-guided vision transformer (MG-ViT) to achieve an
effective and efficient FSL on ViT model. The key idea is to apply a mask on
image patches to screen out the task-irrelevant ones and to guide the ViT to
focus on task-relevant and discriminative patches during FSL. Particularly,
MG-ViT only introduces an additional mask operation and a residual connection,
enabling the inheritance of parameters from pre-trained ViT without any other
cost. To optimally select representative few-shot samples, we also include an
active learning based sample selection method to further improve the
generalizability of MG-ViT based FSL. We evaluate the proposed MG-ViT on both
Agri-ImageNet classification task and ACFR apple detection task with
gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) as the mask. The
experimental results show that the MG-ViT model significantly improves the
performance when compared with general fine-tuning based ViT models, providing
novel insights and a concrete approach towards generalizing data-intensive and
large-scale deep learning models for FSL.

incidents. When an issue is detected, operators need to quickly and correctly
identify its location to facilitate a swift repair. In this work, we consider
the problem of identifying the root cause set that best explains an anomaly in
multi-dimensional time series with categorical attributes. The huge search
space is the main challenge, even for a small number of attributes and small
value sets, the number of theoretical combinations is too large to brute force.
Previous approaches have thus focused on reducing the search space, but they
all suffer from various issues, requiring extensive manual parameter tuning,
being too slow and thus impractical, or being incapable of finding more complex
root causes. We propose RiskLoc to solve the problem of multidimensional root
cause localization. RiskLoc applies a 2-way partitioning scheme and assigns
element weights that linearly increase with the distance from the partitioning
point. A risk score is assigned to each element that integrates two factors, 1)
its weighted proportion within the abnormal partition, and 2) the relative
change in the deviation score adjusted for the ripple effect property.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of RiskLoc, and for a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce three
synthetically generated datasets that complement existing datasets. We
demonstrate that RiskLoc consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
especially in more challenging root cause scenarios, with gains in F1-score up
to 57% over the second-best approach with comparable running times.

previous methods have alleviated this issue by removing the dynamic regions in
the photometric loss formulation based on the masks estimated from another

paper, to handle this problem, we propose an isometric self-sample-based
learning (ISSL) method to fully utilize the training images in a simple yet
effective way. The proposed method provides additional supervision during
training using self-generated images that comply with pure static scene
assumption. Specifically, the isometric self-sample generator synthesizes
self-samples for each training image by applying random rigid transformations
on the estimated depth. Thus both the generated self-samples and the
corresponding training image always follow the static scene assumption. We show
that plugging our ISSL module into several existing models consistently
improves the performance by a large margin. In addition, it also boosts the
depth accuracy over different types of scene, i.e., outdoor scenes (KITTI and
Make3D) and indoor scene (NYUv2), validating its high effectiveness.

is only at its premises. In this paper, we make a step towards understanding
the effect of the strong source of mismatch which is the noise statistics. Our
main technical contribution is the rigorous analysis of a Bayes estimator and
of an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, both of which incorrectly
assume a Gaussian setup. The first result exploits the theory of spherical
integrals and of low-rank matrix perturbations; the idea behind the second one
is to design and analyze an artificial AMP which, by taking advantage of the
flexibility in the denoisers, is able to ""correct"" the mismatch. Armed with
these sharp asymptotic characterizations, we unveil a rich and often unexpected
phenomenology. For example, despite AMP is in principle designed to efficiently
compute the Bayes estimator, the former is outperformed by the latter in terms
of mean-square error. We show that this performance gap is due to an incorrect
estimation of the signal norm. In fact, when the SNR is large enough, the
overlaps of the AMP and the Bayes estimator coincide, and they even match those

multiple datasets that each have a subset of desired annotations of color,

complementary features corresponding to desired annotations. Finally, CoLabel
fuses them together for final predictions. During feature fusion, CoLabel
harmonizes complementary branches so that VMMR features are compatible with

simultaneously, remains elusive. Here we present first-principle-based
simulations in combination with scanning probe microscopy of ultrathin
epitaxial (001) PbZr0.4Ti0.6O3 heterostructures to address this gap. The
simulations predict that as-grown labyrinthine domains will transform to
bubbles under combinations of reduced film thickness, increased mechanical
pressure and/or improved electrical screening. These topological transitions
are explained by a common fundamental mechanism. Namely, we argue that,
independently of the nature of the driving force, the evolution of the domain
morphology allows the system to conserve its original residual depolarization
field. Thereby, the latter remains pinned to a value determined by an external

for social networking services and e-commerce platforms. GSP auctions, which
are simple and easy to understand for advertisers, have almost become the
benchmark for ad auction mechanisms in the industry. However, most GSP-based
industrial practices assume that the user click only relies on the ad itself,
which overlook the effect of external items, referred to as externalities.
Recently, DNA has attempted to upgrade GSP with deep neural networks and models
local externalities to some extent. However, it only considers set-level
contexts from auctions and ignores the order and displayed position of ads,
which is still suboptimal. Although VCG-based multi-slot auctions (e.g., VCG,
WVCG) make it theoretically possible to model global externalities (e.g., the
order and positions of ads and so on), they lack an efficient balance of both
revenue and social welfare. In this paper, we propose novel auction mechanisms
named Neural Multi-slot Auctions (NMA) to tackle the above-mentioned
challenges. Specifically, we model the global externalities effectively with a
context-aware list-wise prediction module to achieve better performance. We
design a list-wise deep rank module to guarantee incentive compatibility in
end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose an auxiliary loss for social
welfare to effectively reduce the decline of social welfare while maximizing
revenue. Experiment results on both offline large-scale datasets and online A/B
tests demonstrate that NMA obtains higher revenue with balanced social welfare
than other existing auction mechanisms (i.e., GSP, DNA, WVCG) in industrial
practice, and we have successfully deployed NMA on Meituan food delivery

design another class of surrogate functions that can be used to solve the
adversarial consistency issue. As a first step towards designing such a class,
we identify sufficient and necessary conditions for a surrogate loss to be

almost linearly with D from -0.7 to -1.1 V/nm, suggesting a reduced Fermi

solutions are built from an analytic basis of momentum operators and their
time-dependent coefficients, which solve a set of recursive differential
equations. We also provide an exact closed perturbative solution for such

To illustrate our findings, we compute the exact two-loop dark matter density

difference between the exact $\Lambda$CDM and the (quasi-)EdS approximated

exploiting the degeneracy with the EFT counterterms. As an additional benefit

optical tweezers rely on tightly focused laser beams, generating a
three-dimensional (3D) trap at the focal point. In acoustics, 3D traps have
so-far only been reported experimentally with specific wavefields called
acoustical vortices. Indeed, many types of particles are expelled (not

focused beams have so-far only been partially explored. In this paper, we
explore numerically with an angular spectrum code the trapping capabilities of
focused beams on a wide range of parameters (size over wavelength ratio and

  and Inference System",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increasing diversity of ML infrastructures nowadays, distributed
training over heterogeneous computing systems is desired to facilitate the
production of big models. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have been proposed to
lower the cost of training subject to the overall size of models/data through
gating and parallelism in a divide-and-conquer fashion. While DeepSpeed has
made efforts in carrying out large-scale MoE training over heterogeneous
infrastructures, the efficiency of training and inference could be further
improved from several system aspects, including load balancing,
communication/computation efficiency, and memory footprint limits. In this
work, we present SE-MoE that proposes Elastic MoE training with 2D prefetch and
Fusion communication over Hierarchical storage, so as to enjoy efficient
parallelisms in various types. For scalable inference in a single node,
especially when the model size is larger than GPU memory, SE-MoE forms the
CPU-GPU memory jointly into a ring of sections to load the model, and executes
the computation tasks across the memory sections in a round-robin manner for
efficient inference. We carried out extensive experiments to evaluate SE-MoE,
where SE-MoE successfully trains a Unified Feature Optimization (UFO) model
with a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts model of 12B parameters in 8 days on
48 A100 GPU cards. The comparison against the state-of-the-art shows that
SE-MoE outperformed DeepSpeed with 33% higher throughput (tokens per second) in
training and 13% higher throughput in inference in general. Particularly, under
unbalanced MoE Tasks, e.g., UFO, SE-MoE achieved 64% higher throughput with 18%
lower memory footprints. The code of the framework will be released on:

avoidance policies and the modeling of ADS by combining descriptions of their

vehicles. An ADS is modeled as a dynamic system involving a set of vehicles
coordinated by a Runtime that based on vehicle positions on a map and their
kinetic attributes, computes free spaces for each vehicle. Vehicles are bounded
to move within the corresponding allocated free spaces. We provide a correct by
design safe control policy for an ADS if its vehicles and the Runtime respect
corresponding assume-guarantee contracts. The result is established by showing
that the composition of assume-guarantee contracts is an inductive invariant
that entails ADS safety. We show that it is practically possible to define
speed control policies for vehicles that comply with their contracts.
Furthermore, we show that traffic rules can be specified in a linear-time
temporal logic, as a class of formulas that constrain vehicle speeds. The main
result is that, given a set of traffic rules, it is possible to derive free
space policies of the Runtime such that the resulting system behavior is safe

a presence of CX and the result is also supported by our new radio observation,

a thin layer with a thickness of 0.2--0.3\% of the shock radius. The result is
consistent with a previous theoretical expectation and we therefore conclude
that CX occurs in G296.1$-$0.5.

cooling rate dependence is largely sample dependent. Here we find that, while
the low-temperature thermal conductivity significantly depends on the cooling
rate, the high-temperature resistivity is almost perfectly independent of the

residual term, the mean free path of the quasiparticles that carry the heat at
low temperatures is governed by disorders, whose characteristic length scale of
the distribution is much longer than the electron mean free path that
determines the high-temperature resistivity. This explains why recent X-ray
diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements show no cooling rate
dependence. Naturally, these measurements are unsuitable for detecting
disorders of the length scale relevant for the thermal conductivity, just as
they cannot determine the residual resistivity of metals. Present results

B20 structure have recently been found to host unconventional chiral fermions
beyond spin-1/2 WFs, and also exhibit exotic physical phenomena such as long
Fermi arc surface states, GME and quantized CPGE. Thus, exploring novel
spin-related transports in these unconventional chiral fermion semimetals may
open a new door for spintronics and spin caloritronics. In this paper, we study
the intrinsic SHE and SNE in the CoSi family based on ab initio relativistic
band structure calculations. First, we find that unlike nonchiral cubic metals,
the CoSi family have two independent nonzero SHC (SNC) tensor elements, namely,
$\sigma_{xy}^z$ and $\sigma_{xz}^y$ ($\alpha_{xy}^z$ and $\alpha_{xz}^y$)
instead of one element. Furthermore, the SHC ($\sigma_{xy}^z$ and
$\sigma_{xz}^y$) and helicity of the chiral structure are found to be
correlated, thus enabling SHE detection of structural helicity and also chiral
fermion chirality. Second, the intrinsic SHE and SNE in some of the CoSi family
are large. In particular, the calculated SHC of RhGe is as large as -140
($\hbar$/e)(S/cm). The calculated SNC of CoGe is also large, being -1.3
($\hbar$/e)(A/m K) at room temperature. Due to their semimetallic nature with
low electrical conductivity, these topological semimetals may have large spin
Hall and spin Nernst angles, being comparable to that of Pt metal. The SHC and
SNC of these compounds can also be increased by raising or lowering $\mu$ to,
e.g., the topological nodes, via either chemical doping or electrical gating.
Our findings thus indicate that the CoSi family not only would provide a
material platform for exploring novel spin-transports and exotic phenomena in
unconventional chiral fermion semimetals but also could be promising materials
for developing better spintronic and spin caloritronic devices.

experimentally show that the key to good MC-approximated predictive
distributions is the quality of the approximate posterior itself. However,
previous methods for obtaining accurate posterior approximations are expensive
and non-trivial to implement. We, therefore, propose to refine Gaussian
approximate posteriors with normalizing flows. When applied to last-layer BNNs,
it yields a simple \emph{post hoc} method for improving pre-existing parametric
approximations. We show that the resulting posterior approximation is
competitive with even the gold-standard full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

""global"" property of Vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), whose self-attention
mechanism reasons over arbitrary subset of discrete image patches. However, it
is still unclear how the advanced Pyramid-based ViTs (e.g., PVT, Swin) can be
adopted in MAE pre-training as they commonly introduce operators within ""local""
windows, making it difficult to handle the random sequence of partial vision
tokens. In this paper, we propose Uniform Masking (UM), successfully enabling
MAE pre-training for Pyramid-based ViTs with locality (termed ""UM-MAE"" for
short). Specifically, UM includes a Uniform Sampling (US) that strictly samples
$1$ random patch from each $2 \times 2$ grid, and a Secondary Masking (SM)
which randomly masks a portion of (usually $25\%$) the already sampled regions
as learnable tokens. US preserves equivalent elements across multiple
non-overlapped local windows, resulting in the smooth support for popular
Pyramid-based ViTs; whilst SM is designed for better transferable visual
representations since US reduces the difficulty of pixel recovery pre-task that
hinders the semantic learning. We demonstrate that UM-MAE significantly
improves the pre-training efficiency (e.g., it speeds up and reduces the GPU
memory by $\sim 2\times$) of Pyramid-based ViTs, but maintains the competitive
fine-tuning performance across downstream tasks. For example using HTC++

instantiations of popular GNN models trained on the same data with the same
model hyperparameters result in almost identical aggregated performance but
display substantial disagreement in the predictions for individual nodes. We
find that up to one third of the incorrectly classified nodes differ across

our method for settings where sensitive training data is not available, for

estimating a model's sensitivity to a unique feature by comparing the KL

overfitting do not prevent unique feature memorisation. And that images
containing a unique feature are highly influential, regardless of the influence

pronounced in healthcare applications since sensitive patient information can
be memorised when it remains in training data due to an imperfect data

conditions at the irregular points across the interface using Lagrangian
interpolation on a Cartesian grid. This approach, which starts with the
discretization of parabolic equations with discontinuities in the solutions,
source terms and the coefficients across the interface, can easily be
accommodated into simulating flow past bluff bodies immersed in the flow. The
superiority of the approach is reflected by the reduced magnitude and faster
decay of the errors in comparison to other existing methods. It is seen to
handle several fluid flow problems having practical implications in the real
world very efficiently, which involves flows involving multiple and moving
bodies. This includes the flow past a stationary circular and a twenty-four
edge cactus cylinder, flows past two tandem cylinders, where in one situation
both are fixed and in another, one of them is oscillating transversely with

$\psi$-$\zeta$ formulation in finite difference set-up. The extreme closeness
of our computed solutions with the existing numerical and experimental results
exemplifies the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed approach.

DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional
neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and
determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses
information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of
DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80

generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much

Quality Assessment(IQA) algorithms have been designed to tackle this problem.
However, it still remains un settled due to the various types of image
distortions and the lack of large-scale human-rated datasets. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm based on the Swin Transformer [31] with fused
features from multiple stages, which aggregates information from both local and

small-scale datasets, relative rankings of images have been taken into account
together with regression loss to simultaneously optimize the model.
Furthermore, effective data augmentation strategies are also used to improve
the performance. In comparisons with previous works, experiments are carried
out on two standard IQA datasets and a challenge dataset. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our work. The proposed method outperforms
other methods on standard datasets and ranks 2nd in the no-reference track of

protoplanetary disk locations where the volume density of the solid particles
is enriched comparable to that of the gas. A ring of planetesimals thus forms
when this condition is fulfilled locally. These planetesimals collide with each
other and accrete inward drifting pebbles from the outer disk to further
increase masses. We investigate the growth of the planetesimals that form in a
ring-belt at various disk radii. Their initial mass distributions are
calculated based on the formula summarized from the streaming instability
simulations. We simulate the subsequent dynamical evolution of the
planetesimals with a protoplanetary disk model based either on the minimum mass
solar nebula (MMSN) or on the Toomre stability criterion. For the MMSN model,
both pebble accretion and planetesimal accretion are efficient at a close-in
orbit of $0.3$ AU, resulting in the emergence of several super-Earth mass
planets after $1$ Myr. For comparison, only the most massive planetesimals
undergo substantial mass growth when they are born at $r{=}3$ AU, while the
planetesimals at $r{=}30$ AU experience little or no growth. On the other hand,
in the denser Toomre disk, the most massive forming planets can reach Earth
mass at $t{=}1$ Myr and reach a mass between that of Neptune and that of Saturn
within $3$ Myr at $30$ AU and $100$ AU. Both the pebble and planetesimal
accretion rate decrease with disk radial distance. Nevertheless, planetesimal
accretion is less pronounced than pebble accretion at more distant disk
regions. Taken together, the planets acquire higher masses when the disk has a
higher gas density, a higher pebble flux, and/or a lower Stokes number of
pebbles.

BeyondPlanck (BP) analysis framework. This method supports seamless end-to-end

As a first demonstration of the method, we analyze time-ordered Planck LFI
observations, combined with selected external data (WMAP 33-61GHz, Planck HFI
DR4 353 and 857GHz, and Haslam 408MHz) in the form of pixelized maps which are
used to break critical astrophysical degeneracies. Overall, all results are
generally in good agreement with previously reported values from Planck 2018
and WMAP, with the largest relative difference for any parameter of about 1
sigma when considering only temperature multipoles between 29<l<601. In cases
where there are differences, we note that the BP results are generally slightly
closer to the high-l HFI-dominated Planck 2018 results than previous analyses,
suggesting slightly less tension between low and high multipoles. Using low-l
polarization information from LFI and WMAP, we find a best-fit value of
tau=0.066 +/- 0.013, which is higher than the low value of tau=0.051 +/- 0.006
derived from Planck 2018 and slightly lower than the value of 0.069 +/- 0.011
derived from joint analysis of official LFI and WMAP products. Most
importantly, however, we find that the uncertainty derived in the BP processing
is about 30% larger than when analyzing the official products, after taking
into account the different sky coverage. We argue that this is due to
marginalizing over a more complete model of instrumental and astrophysical
parameters, and this results in both more reliable and more rigorously defined
uncertainties. We find that about 2000 Monte Carlo samples are required to
achieve robust convergence for low-resolution CMB covariance matrix with 225

that for each $(s,t) \in \mathcal{P}$, $G-S$ has no path from $s$ to $t$. Edge
Multicut has been relatively recently shown to be fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT), parameterized by $k$, by Marx and Razgon [SICOMP 2014], and
independently by Bousquet et al. [SICOMP 2018]. In the weighted version of the
problem, called Weighted Edge Multicut one is additionally given a weight
function $\mathtt{wt} : E(G) \to \mathbb{N}$ and a weight bound $w$, and the
goal is to determine if there is a solution of size at most $k$ and weight at
most $w$. Both the FPT algorithms for Edge Multicut by Marx et al. and Bousquet

problem is non-trivial even on trees and determining whether Weighted Edge
Multicut on trees is FPT was explicitly posed as an open problem by Bousquet et
al. [STACS 2009]. In this article, we answer this question positively by
designing an algorithm which uses a very recent result by Kim et al. [STOC

  We also study a variant of this problem where there is no bound on the size
of the solution, but the parameter is a structural property of the input, for
example, the number of leaves of the tree. We strengthen our results by stating

scale well with the size of the graph. We propose a low-complexity approach for
identifying a (possibly much smaller) subgraph of the original graph where the
heuristics can be run in reasonable time and with a high likelihood of finding
a global near-optimal solution. The core component of our approach is LeNSE, a
reinforcement learning algorithm that learns how to navigate the space of
possible subgraphs using an Euclidean subgraph embedding as its map. To solve
CO problems, LeNSE is provided with a discriminative embedding trained using
any existing heuristics using only on a small portion of the original graph.
When tested on three problems (vertex cover, max-cut and influence
maximisation) using real graphs with up to $10$ million edges, LeNSE identifies
small subgraphs yielding solutions comparable to those found by running the
heuristics on the entire graph, but at a fraction of the total run time.

while the training data are collected and located at the local devices. Hence,
the labels in practice are usually annotated by clients of varying expertise or
criteria and thus contain different amounts of noises. Local training on noisy
labels can easily result in overfitting to noisy labels, which is devastating
to the global model through aggregation. Although recent robust FL methods take
malicious clients into account, they have not addressed local noisy labels on
each device and the impact to the global model. In this paper, we develop a
simple two-level sampling method ""FedNoiL"" that (1) selects clients for more
robust global aggregation on the server; and (2) selects clean labels and
correct pseudo-labels at the client end for more robust local training. The
sampling probabilities are built upon clean label detection by the global
model. Moreover, we investigate different schedules changing the local epochs
between aggregations over the course of FL, which notably improves the
communication and computation efficiency in noisy label setting. In experiments
with homogeneous/heterogeneous data distributions and noise ratios, we observed
that direct combinations of SOTA FL methods with SOTA noisy-label learning
methods can easily fail but our method consistently achieves better and robust
performance.

adult humans and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) perform close to ceiling. Unlike
adults', whose object recognition performance is robust against a wide range of

poorly on distorted images. However, the last two years have seen impressive
gains in DNN distortion robustness, predominantly achieved through
ever-increasing large-scale datasets$\unicode{x2014}$orders of magnitude larger
than ImageNet. While this simple brute-force approach is very effective in
achieving human-level robustness in DNNs, it raises the question of whether
human robustness, too, is simply due to extensive experience with (distorted)
visual input during childhood and beyond. Here we investigate this question by
comparing the core object recognition performance of 146 children (aged
4$\unicode{x2013}$15) against adults and against DNNs. We find, first, that
already 4$\unicode{x2013}$6 year-olds showed remarkable robustness to image

number of $\unicode{x201C}$images$\unicode{x201D}$ children have been exposed

requires relatively little data. Third, when recognizing objects
children$\unicode{x2014}$like adults but unlike DNNs$\unicode{x2014}$rely
heavily on shape but not on texture cues. Together our results suggest that the
remarkable robustness to distortions emerges early in the developmental
trajectory of human object recognition and is unlikely the result of a mere
accumulation of experience with distorted visual input. Even though current
DNNs match human performance regarding robustness they seem to rely on
different and more data-hungry strategies to do so.

consider a local $U(1) $ extension of the SM providing an axion particle to
solve the strong CP problem and including RH neutrinos with appropriate mass
terms. One of the latter is decoupled from the SM leptons and can constitute
stable sterile neutrino DM. In this setting, the PQ symmetry arises only as an
accidental symmetry but its breaking by higher order operators is sufficiently
suppressed to avoid introducing a large $ \theta $ contribution. The axion
decay constant and the RH neutrino masses are related to the same v.e.v.s and
the PQ scale and both DM densities are determined by the parameters of the
axion and scalar sector. The model predicts in general a mixed Dark Matter

This paper overviews four seemingly unrelated approaches, that can each be
viewed as learning the objective function of a hard combinatorial optimisation

decision-focused learning (`predict + optimise'), and 4) structured-output
prediction. We formalise each learning paradigm, at first in the ways commonly
found in the literature, and then bring the formalisations together in a

  among U.S. Reddit users",,,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Past research has attributed the online circulation of misinformation to two
main factors - individual characteristics (e.g., a person's information
literacy) and social media effects (e.g., algorithm-mediated information
diffusion) - and has overlooked a third one: the critical mass created by the
offline self-segregation of Americans into like-minded geographical regions
such as states (a phenomenon called ""The Big Sort""). We hypothesized that this
latter factor matters for the online spreading of misinformation not least
because online interactions, despite having the potential of being global, end
up being localized: interaction probability is known to rapidly decay with
distance. Upon analysis of more than 8M Reddit comments containing news links
spanning four years, from January 2016 to December 2019, we found that Reddit
did not work as an ""hype machine"" for misinformation (as opposed to what
previous work reported for other platforms, circulation was not mainly caused
by platform-facilitated network effects) but worked as a supply-and-demand
system: misinformation news items scaled linearly with the number of users in
each state (with a scaling exponent beta=1, and a goodness of fit R2 = 0.95).
Furthermore, deviations from such a universal pattern were best explained by
state-level personality and cultural factors (R2 = {0.12, 0.39}), rather than
socioeconomic conditions (R2 = {0.15, 0.29}) or, as one would expect, political
characteristics (R2 ={0.06, 0.21}). Higher-than-expected circulation of any
type of news (including reputable news) was found in states characterised by
residents who tend to be less diligent in terms of their personality (low in
conscientiousness) and by loose cultures understating the importance of
adherence to norms (low in cultural tightness).

performance and generality. Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks

prohibitively slow due to the large model sizes and the resultant high
network/computation cost. Towards practical FedNLP, we identify as the key
building blocks adapters, small bottleneck modules inserted at a variety of
model layers. A key challenge is to properly configure the depth and width of
adapters, to which the training speed and efficiency is highly sensitive. No
silver-bullet configuration exists: the optimal choice varies across downstream
NLP tasks, desired model accuracy, and mobile resources. To automate adapter
configuration, we propose FedAdapter, a framework that enhances the existing
FedNLP with two novel designs. First, FedAdapter progressively upgrades the
adapter configuration throughout a training session; the principle is to
quickly learn shallow knowledge by only training fewer and smaller adapters at
the model's top layers, and incrementally learn deep knowledge by incorporating
deeper and larger adapters. Second, FedAdapter continuously profiles future
adapter configurations by allocating participant devices to trial groups.
Extensive experiments show that FedAdapter can reduce FedNLP's model
convergence delay to no more than several hours, which is up to 155.5$\times$
faster compared to vanilla FedNLP and 48$\times$ faster compared to strong
baselines.

range communication because of the serious free space path loss and the
blockage by obstacles. To overcome these challenges, highly directional beams
are exploited to achieve robust links by hybrid beamforming. Accurately
aligning the transmitter and receiver beams, i.e. beam training, is vitally
important to high data rate transmission. However, it may cause huge overhead

the mobility patterns of users are complicated and dynamic, which may cause

simulations with RADMC-3D provide adequate fits to the spectral energy
distribution from the optical to the submillimeter and to the interferometric
observables when opting for an accretion rate $\dot{M}\sim 2\times 10^{-5}\,
M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and assuming $M_*=0.6\, M_\odot$. Most importantly, the hot
inner accretion disk's outer radius can be fixed at 0.3 au. The outer radius of
the dusty disk is placed at 100 au, based on constraints from scattered-light
images in the literature. The dust mass contained in the disk is
$2.4\times10^{-4}\, M_\odot$, and for a typical gas-to-dust ratio of 100, the
total mass in the disk is approximately 0.02 $M_\odot$. We did not find any
evidence for a nearby companion in the current interferometric data, and we
tentatively explored the case of disk misalignment. For the latter, our
modeling results suggest that the disk orientation is similar to that found in
previous imaging studies by ALMA. Should there be an asymmetry in the very
compact, inner accretion disk, this might be resolved at even smaller spatial
scales ($\leq1$ mas).

  Account Creation on the Web","Accepted at USENIX Security 2022",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ubiquity of user accounts in websites and online services makes account
hijacking a serious security concern. Although previous research has studied
various techniques through which an attacker can gain access to a victim's
account, relatively little attention has been directed towards the process of
account creation. The current trend towards federated authentication (e.g.,
Single Sign-On) adds an additional layer of complexity because many services
now support both the classic approach in which the user directly sets a
password, and the federated approach in which the user authenticates via an
identity provider.
  Inspired by previous work on preemptive account hijacking [Ghasemisharif et
al., USENIX SEC 2018], we show that there exists a whole class of account
pre-hijacking attacks. The distinctive feature of these attacks is that the
attacker performs some action before the victim creates an account, which makes
it trivial for the attacker to gain access after the victim has
created/recovered the account. Assuming a realistic attacker who knows only the
victim's email address, we identify and discuss five different types of account
pre-hijacking attacks.
  To ascertain the prevalence of such vulnerabilities in the wild, we analyzed
75 popular services and found that at least 35 of these were vulnerable to one
or more account pre-hijacking attacks. Whilst some of these may be noticed by
attentive users, others were completely undetectable from the victim's
perspective. Finally, we investigated the root cause of these vulnerabilities
and present a set of security requirements to prevent such vulnerabilities
arising in future.

resource collection, traps and crafting. After pre-training we expose the SF

Transferring is done without any further training on the SF agents, instead
just by providing a task vector. For training the SFs we propose a task

coherent elliptic scattering within a high finesse optical cavity.
Translational temperatures in the 100 $\mu$K range were reached while
temperatures as low as 5 mK were attained in the librational degrees of

an important but unsolved challenge for video restoration (VR). In this work,

address this problem. On the one hand, the sequence-to-sequence model, which
has proven capable of sequence modeling in the field of natural language
processing, is explored for the first time in VR. Optimized serialization
modeling shows potential in capturing long-range dependencies among frames. On
the other hand, we equip the sequence-to-sequence model with an unsupervised
optical flow estimator to maximize its potential. The flow estimator is trained
with our proposed unsupervised distillation loss, which can alleviate the data
discrepancy and inaccurate degraded optical flow issues of previous flow-based
methods. With reliable optical flow, we can establish accurate correspondence
among multiple frames, narrowing the domain difference between 1D language and
2D misaligned frames and improving the potential of the sequence-to-sequence
model. S2SVR shows superior performance in multiple VR tasks, including video
deblurring, video super-resolution, and compressed video quality enhancement.

type is exoplanetary transits. The photometric data accumulated so far have
finally matured enough to allow the detection of some exoplanets.
  Aims: In order to fully exploit the scientific potential of Gaia, we search
its photometric data for the signatures of exoplanetary transits.
  Methods: The search relies on a version of the Box-Least-Square (BLS) method,
applied to a set of stars prioritized by machine-learning classification
methods. An independent photometric validation was obtained using the public
full-frame images of TESS. In order to validate the first two candidates,
radial-velocity follow-up observations were performed using the spectrograph
PEPSI of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).
  Results: The radial-velocity measurements confirm that two of the candidates
are indeed hot Jupiters. Thus, they are the first exoplanets detected by Gaia -
Gaia-1b and Gaia-2b.
  Conclusions: Gaia-1b and Gaia-2b demonstrate that the approach presented in
this paper is indeed effective. This approach will be used to assemble a set of
additional exoplanet candidates, to be released in Gaia third data release,
ensuring better fulfillment of the exoplanet detection potential of Gaia.

causal inference. In recent times, inference for the ATE in the presence of
high-dimensional covariates has been extensively studied. Among the diverse
approaches that have been proposed, augmented inverse probability weighting
(AIPW) with cross-fitting has emerged a popular choice in practice. In this
work, we study this cross-fit AIPW estimator under well-specified outcome
regression and propensity score models in a high-dimensional regime where the
number of features and samples are both large and comparable. Under assumptions
on the covariate distribution, we establish a new central limit theorem for the
suitably scaled cross-fit AIPW that applies without any sparsity assumptions on
the underlying high-dimensional parameters. Our CLT uncovers two crucial
phenomena among others: (i) the AIPW exhibits a substantial variance inflation
that can be precisely quantified in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and
other problem parameters, (ii) the asymptotic covariance between the
pre-cross-fit estimators is non-negligible even on the root-n scale. These
findings are strikingly different from their classical counterparts. On the
technical front, our work utilizes a novel interplay between three distinct
tools--approximate message passing theory, the theory of deterministic
equivalents, and the leave-one-out approach. We believe our proof techniques
should be useful for analyzing other two-stage estimators in this
high-dimensional regime. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with
simulations that demonstrate both the finite sample efficacy of our CLT and its
robustness to our assumptions.

of this paper is to perform object detection in the underwater environment.
This paper proposed a novel method for capturing feature information, which

The interference of underwater creature characteristics on object
characteristics is decreased, and the output of the backbone network to object

empowerment of FL through blockchain (also referred to as FLchain), however,
has some implications in terms of ledger inconsistencies and age of information
(AoI), which are naturally inherited from the blockchain's fully decentralized

versions in the blockchain, FL devices may use different models for training,
and that, given the asynchronicity of the FL operation, stale local updates
(computed using outdated models) may be generated. In this paper, we shed light
on the implications of the FLchain setting and study the effect that both the
AoI and ledger inconsistencies have on the FL performance. To that end, we

maneuvering of the laser beam, as opposed to fixed mechanical rotations. This

pattern. We examine here the abstract problem of whether adapting the sampling
pattern for a given frame can reduce the reconstruction error or allow a
sparser pattern. We propose a constructive generic method to guide adaptive

  Given a sampling budget B, a depth predictor P and a desired quality measure
M, we propose an Importance Map that highlights important sampling locations.
This map is defined for a given frame as the per-pixel expected value of M
produced by the predictor P, given a pattern of B random samples. This map can
be well estimated in a training phase. We show that a neural network can learn
to produce a highly faithful Importance Map, given an RGB image. We then
suggest an algorithm to produce a sampling pattern for the scene, which is
denser in regions that are harder to reconstruct. The sampling strategy of our
modular framework can be adjusted according to hardware limitations, type of
depth predictor, and any custom reconstruction error measure that should be
minimized. We validate through simulations that our approach outperforms grid

underdeveloped left heart. They typically receive a sequence of surgeries that
result in a single ventricle physiology called the Fontan circulation. While
these patients usually survive into early adulthood, they are at risk for
medical complications, partially due to their lower than normal cardiac output,
which leads to insufficient cerebral and gut perfusion. While clinical imaging
data can provide detailed insight into cardiovascular function within the
imaged region, it is difficult to use this data for assessing deficiencies in
the rest of the body and for deriving blood pressure dynamics. Data from
patients used in this paper include three dimensional, magnetic resonance
angiograms (MRA), time-resolved phase contrast cardiac magnetic resonance
images (4D-MRI) and sphygmomanometer blood pressure measurements. The 4D-MRI
images provide detailed insight into velocity and flow in vessels within the
imaged region, but they cannot predict flow in the rest of the body, nor do
they provide values of blood pressure. To remedy these limitations, this study
combines the MRA, 4D-MRI, and pressure data with 1D fluid dynamics models to
predict hemodynamics in the major systemic arteries, including the cerebral and
gut vasculature. To study effects post-surgery we compare simulations for an
HLHS patient with simulations for a matched control patient that has double
outlet right ventricle (DORV) physiology with a native aorta. Our results show
that the HLHS patient has hypertensive pressures in the brain as well as
reduced flow to the gut. Wave-intensity analysis suggests that the HLHS patient
has irregular circulatory function during light upright exercise conditions and
that predicted wall-shear stresses are lower than normal, suggesting the HLHS
patient may have hypertension.

theory of hard-MREs, obtained by reformulating the remnant magnetization of a
deformed hard-MRE body. Specifically, the magnetizations in the initial and
current configurations are related by the rotation tensor decomposed from the
deformation gradient, independently of stretching deformation. This description
is motivated by recently reported observations in microscopic homogenization
simulations. Then, we derive a 2D plate model through the dimensional reduction
of our proposed rotation-based 3D theory. For comparison, we also provide a
second plate model derived from the existing 3D theory. Finally, we perform
precision experiments to thoroughly evaluate the proposed 3D and 2D models on
hard-magnetic plates under various magnetic and mechanical loading conditions.
We demonstrate that our rotation-based modification of the magnetic potential

applied field aligned with the magnetization, and undergoing in-plane
stretching. In all the tested cases, our rotation-based 3D and 2D models yield

report on an ultrabright entangled photon source that is optimized for

is efficiently detected with space-ready single photon avalanche diodes
(Si-SPADs), and readily provides pair emission rates that exceed the detector
bandwidth (i.e., the temporal resolution). To overcome this limitation, we
demultiplex the photon flux into wavelength channels that can be handled by
current single photon detector technology. This is achieved efficiently by
using the spectral correlations due to hyper-entanglement in polarization and
frequency as an auxiliary resource. Combined with recent demonstrations of
space-proof source prototypes, these results pave the way to a broadband

and soft blackbody components with almost identical temperatures and a total
accretion rate of $\dot{M}=1.4(8)\times10^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
X-ray centers of the humps show longitudinal shifts of -18 and 4 degrees and
-172 and -186 degrees size around photometric phase zero, for the main hump and
second hump, respectively. The long-term ZTF light curves reveal high and low

an $0.8$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf at 10000 K and a main-sequence donor star with
a spectral type of M5.0 at a \gai-determined distance of 758 pc. V496 UMa is a
very bright polar in X-rays when it is in the high state. Due to its unusual
geometric structure, mass accretion onto the second accretion pole is
interrupted occasionally. This discontinuous behavior does not follow a certain
pattern in time and is observed so far only in the high state. The X-ray light

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach, namely Characteristic
Reward Sequence Prediction (CRESP), to extract the task-relevant information by
learning reward sequence distributions (RSDs), as the reward signals are
task-relevant in RL and invariant to visual distractions. Specifically, to
effectively capture the task-relevant information via RSDs, CRESP introduces an
auxiliary task -- that is, predicting the characteristic functions of RSDs --
to learn task-relevant representations, because we can well approximate the
high-dimensional distributions by leveraging the corresponding characteristic

performance of generalization on unseen environments, outperforming several
state-of-the-arts on DeepMind Control tasks with different visual distractions.

planets around very low-mass (VLM) stars (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima
Centauri). However, current theoretical models strive to explain planet
formation in these conditions and do not predict the development of giant
planets. Recent high-resolution observations from ALMA of the disk around CIDA
1, a VLM star in Taurus, show substructures hinting at the presence of a
massive planet. We aim to reproduce the dust ring of CIDA 1, observed in the
dust continuum emission in ALMA Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1 mm), along with
its $^{12}$CO (J=3-2) and $^{13}$CO (J=3-2) channel maps, assuming the
structures are shaped by the interaction of the disk with a massive planet. We
seek to retrieve the mass and position of the putative planet. We model the
protoplanetary disk with a set of hydrodynamical simulations, varying the mass
and locations of the embedded planet. We compute the dust and gas emission
using radiative transfer simulations, and, finally, we obtain the synthetic
observations treating the images as the actual ALMA observations. Our models
indicate that a planet with a minimum mass of $\sim1.4\,\text{M}_\text{Jup}$
orbiting at a distance of $\sim 9-10$ au can explain the morphology and
location of the observed dust ring at Band 7 and Band 4. We can reproduce the
low spectral index ($\sim 2$) observed where the dust ring is detected. Our
synthetic images reproduce the morphology of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
observed channel maps where the cloud absorption allowed a detection. Applying
an empirical relation between planet mass and gap width in the dust, we predict
a maximum planet mass of $\sim4 - 8\,\text{M}_\text{Jup}$. Our results suggest
the presence of a massive planet orbiting CIDA 1, thus challenging our
understanding of planet formation around VLM stars.

Vinfnity Leveraging Manoeuvres (VLM). The SOM has been established
theoretically as an important mechanism by which rapid exit from the solar
system and intercept of ISOs can both be achieved; the VLM has been
demonstrated practically as a method of reducing overall mission Delta-V as
well as the Characteristic Energy, C3, at launch. Thus via these two
applications, the feasibility of missions to interstellar objects (ISOs) such
as 1I/Oumuamua can be analysed. The interplanetary trajectory optimizer tool
exploited for this analysis, OITS, permits IP selection as an encounter option
along the interplanetary trajectory in question. OITS adopts the assumption of
impulsive thrust at discrete points along the trajectory, an assumption which
is generally valid for high thrust propulsion scenarios, like chemical or
nuclear thermal for instance.

  In the further part of this thesis, two examples of single-photon sources are
described, along with their experimental implementation. These sources are
based on the nonlinear spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process,
which has also been described in detail. Parameters that specify the quality of
a single-photon source (such as conversion efficiency, phase-matching

interactions, the symmetry of the Hamiltonian changes from SU(3) to
SU(2)$\otimes$ U(1) and finally to SO(4)$\otimes$ U(1). The system undergoes
the phase transition between the disorder state and the charge density wave
(CDW) state around the SU(3) symmetric points. Away from the SU(3) symmetric
points and the SO(4)$\otimes$ U(1) symmetric points, the system can enter into
the color density wave (color DW) phase or the color selective density wave
(CSDW) phase. Around the SO(4)$\otimes$ U(1) symmetric points, the pairing
order and the CSDW order can be both detected. The pairing order is quickly
suppressed away from the SO(4)$\otimes$ U(1) symmetric points because Cooper
pairs are scattered. When the anisotropy of interaction exists, N\'eel order
appears because the number of off-site trions $|12,3\rangle$ is greater than
the number of other two types of off-site trions and off-site trions
$|12,3\rangle$ do not distribute randomly. The calculated entropy-temperature
relations show the anisotropy of interactions induced adiabatic cooling, which
may provide a new method to cool a system in experiments.

achieved by using counterfactuals, like the way a human becomes familiar with
an unknown process: by understanding the hypothetical circumstances under which
the output changes. In this work we argue that automated counterfactual
generation should regard several aspects of the produced adversarial instances,
not only their adversarial capability. To this end, we present a novel
framework for the generation of counterfactual examples which formulates its
goal as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing three different
objectives: 1) plausibility, i.e., the likeliness of the counterfactual of
being possible as per the distribution of the input data; 2) intensity of the
changes to the original input; and 3) adversarial power, namely, the
variability of the model's output induced by the counterfactual. The framework
departs from a target model to be audited and uses a Generative Adversarial
Network to model the distribution of input data, together with a
multi-objective solver for the discovery of counterfactuals balancing among
these objectives. The utility of the framework is showcased over six
classification tasks comprising image and three-dimensional data. The
experiments verify that the framework unveils counterfactuals that comply with
intuition, increasing the trustworthiness of the user, and leading to further
insights, such as the detection of bias and data misrepresentation.

model meets the group affine property while the filter explicitly addresses the
IMU placement error by formulating its stochastic process model as Brownian
motions and incorporating the error in the leg odometry. Although the
measurement model is imperfect (i.e., it does not possess an invariant

we target the Greedy Additional (GA) algorithm, which has been widely
recognized to be effective but less efficient, and try to improve its
efficiency while preserving effectiveness. In our Accelerated GA (AGA)
algorithm, we use some extra data structures to reduce redundant data accesses
in the GA algorithm and thus the time complexity is reduced from
$\mathcal{O}(m^2n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(kmn)$ when $n > m$, where $m$ is the number
of test cases, $n$ is the number of program elements, and $k$ is the iteration
number. Moreover, we observe the impact of iteration numbers on prioritization
efficiency on our dataset and propose to use a specific iteration number in the
AGA algorithm to further improve the efficiency. We conducted experiments on 55
open-source subjects. In particular, we implemented each TCP algorithm with two
kinds of widely-used input formats, adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Since
a TCP algorithm with adjacency matrix is less efficient than the algorithm with
adjacency list, the result analysis is mainly conducted based on TCP algorithms
with adjacency list. The results show that AGA achieves 5.95X speedup ratio
over GA on average, while it achieves the same average effectiveness as GA in
terms of Average Percentage of Fault Detected (APFD). Moreover, we conducted an
industrial case study on 22 subjects, collected from Baidu, and find that the

their better energy efficiency when connecting DC components. However, they
might be unstable since many loads in a DC microgrid are regulated as constant
power loads (CPLs) that have a destabilizing negative impedance effect. As a
result, the state trajectory displacement caused by abrupt load changes or
contingencies can easily lead to instability. Many existing works have been
devoted to studying the region of attraction (ROA) of a DC microgrid, in which
the system is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable. Nevertheless, existing
work either focuses on using numerical methods for ROA approximations that
generally have no performance guarantees or cannot ensure a desired ROA for a
general DC microgrid. To close this gap, this paper develops an innovative
control synthesis algorithm to make a general DC microgrid have a theoretically
guaranteed ROA, for example, to cover the entirety of its operating range
regarding state trajectories. We first study the nonlinear dynamics of a DC
microgrid to derive a novel transient stability condition to rigorously certify
whether a given operating range is a subset of the ROA; then, we formulate a
control synthesis optimization problem to guarantee the condition's
satisfaction. This condition is a linear constraint, and the optimization
problem resembles an optimal power flow problem and has a good computational
behavior. Simulation case studies verify the validity of the proposed work.

Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction applications, especially in industrial
recommender, search, or advertising systems. However, it's non-trivial for
real-world systems to make full use of long-term user behaviors due to the
strict requirements of online serving time. Most previous works adopt the
retrieval-based strategy, where a small number of user behaviors are retrieved
first for subsequent attention. However, the retrieval-based methods are
sub-optimal and would cause more or less information losses, and it's difficult
to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of the retrieval algorithm.
  In this paper, we propose SDIM (Sampling-based Deep Interest Modeling), a
simple yet effective sampling-based end-to-end approach for modeling long-term
user behaviors. We sample from multiple hash functions to generate hash
signatures of the candidate item and each item in the user behavior sequence,
and obtain the user interest by directly gathering behavior items associated
with the candidate item with the same hash signature. We show theoretically and
experimentally that the proposed method performs on par with standard
attention-based models on modeling long-term user behaviors, while being
sizable times faster. We also introduce the deployment of SDIM in our system.
Specifically, we decouple the behavior sequence hashing, which is the most
time-consuming part, from the CTR model by designing a separate module named
BSE (behavior Sequence Encoding). BSE is latency-free for the CTR server,
enabling us to model extremely long user behaviors. Both offline and online
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of SDIM. SDIM now
has been deployed online in the search system of Meituan APP.

when $g(n)\sim n^\alpha$, for $0<\alpha\leq 1$, and when $g$ is a bounded
function. In such a model, a particle at a regular site $k$ jumps equally
likely to a neighbor with rate $g(n)$, depending only on the number of
particles $n$ at $k$. At a defect site $k_{j,N}$, however, the jump rate is
slowed down to $\lambda_j^{-1}N^{-\beta_j}g(n)$ when $g(n)\sim n^\alpha$, and
to $\lambda_j^{-1}g(n)$ when $g$ is bounded. Here, $N$ is a scaling parameter
where the grid spacing is seen as $1/N$ and time is speeded up by $N^2$.
  Starting from initial measures with $O(N)$ relative entropy with respect to
an invariant measure, we show the hydrodynamic limit and characterize boundary
behaviors at the macroscopic defect sites $x_j = \lim_{N\uparrow \infty} k_{j,

super-critical slow sites ($\beta_j=\alpha$ or $\beta_j>\alpha$), associated
Dirichlet boundary conditions arise as a result of interactions with evolving
atom masses or condensation at the defects. Differently, when $g$ is bounded,
at any slow site ($\lambda_j>1$), we find the hydrodynamic density must be
bounded above by a threshold value reflecting the strength of the defect.
Moreover, due to interactions with masses of atoms stored at the slow sites,
the associated boundary conditions bounce between being periodic and Dirichlet.

applications to public security surveillance, human-computer interaction, etc.
With vigorous development of deep learning, age estimation based on deep neural

problem paradigm for age change characteristics, designing the corresponding
loss function and designing a more effective feature extraction module still
needs to be studied. What is more, change of face age is also related to
demographic attributes such as ethnicity and gender, and the dynamics of
different age groups is also quite different. This problem has so far not been
paid enough attention to. How to use demographic attribute information to
improve the performance of age estimation remains to be further explored. In
light of these issues, this research makes full use of auxiliary information of
face attributes and proposes a new age estimation approach with an attribute
guidance module. We first design a multi-scale attention residual convolution
unit (MARCU) to extract robust facial features other than simply using other
standard feature modules such as VGG and ResNet. Then, after being especially
treated through full connection (FC) layers, the facial demographic attributes
are weight-summed by 1*1 convolutional layer and eventually merged with the age
features by a global FC layer. Lastly, we propose a new error compression
ranking (ECR) loss to better converge the age regression value. Experimental
results on three public datasets of UTKFace, LAP2016 and Morph show that our
proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

approach to revealing the spatial patterns in the human brain; however, there
are three major shortcomings in utilizing DNNs to detect the spatial patterns
in functional Magnetic Resonance Signals: 1). It is a fully connected
architecture that increases the complexity of network structures that is
difficult to optimize and vulnerable to overfitting; 2). The requirement of
large training samples results in erasing the individual/minor patterns in
feature extraction; 3). The hyperparameters are required to be tuned manually,
which is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a novel deep nonlinear matrix
factorization named Deep Matrix Approximately Nonlinear Decomposition (DEMAND)
in this work to take advantage of the shallow linear model, e.g., Sparse
Dictionary Learning (SDL) and DNNs. At first, the proposed DEMAND employs a
non-fully connected and multilayer-stacked architecture that is easier to be

architecture, training DEMAND can avoid overfitting and enables the recognition
of individual/minor features based on a small dataset such as an individual

hyperparameters of DEMAND automatically. Moreover, the proposed DEMAND is
validated by four other peer methodologies via real functional Magnetic

demonstrate that DEMAND can reveal the reproducible meta, canonical, and
sub-spatial features of the human brain more efficiently than other peer
methodologies.

reconstruction of undersampled multi-coil chemical exchange saturation transfer
(CEST) data. Theory and Methods: Inspired by the variational network, the CEST
image reconstruction equation is unrolled into a deep neural network (CEST-VN)
with a k-space data-sharing block that takes advantage of the inherent
redundancy in adjacent CEST frames and 3D spatial-frequential convolution
kernels that exploit correlations in the x-{\omega} domain. Additionally, a new
pipeline based on multiple-pool Bloch-McConnell simulations is devised to
synthesize multi-coil CEST data from publicly available anatomical MRI data.
The proposed neural network is trained on simulated data with a CEST-specific
loss function that jointly measures the structural and CEST contrast. The
performance of CEST-VN was evaluated on three healthy volunteers and five brain
tumor patients using retrospectively undersampled data with various
acceleration factors, and compared with other state-of-the-art reconstruction
methods. Results: The proposed CEST-VN method generated high-quality CEST
source images and APT-weighted (APTw) maps in healthy and brain tumor subjects,
consistently outperforming GRAPPA, blind compressed sensing, and the original
variational network. With the acceleration factors increasing from 3 to 6,
CEST-VN with the same hyperparameters yielded similar and accurate
reconstruction without apparent loss of details or increase of artifacts. The
ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the joint CEST-specific loss
function and data-sharing block used. Conclusions: The proposed CEST-VN method
can offer high-quality CEST source images and APTw maps from highly
undersampled multi-coil data by integrating the deep-learning prior and
multi-coil sensitivity encoding model.

conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that generatively performs

multiplexed spatial proteomics images. This approach can be utilized to
accurately generate missing spatial proteomics channels that were not included
during experimental data collection either at the bench or the clinic.
Experimental spatial proteomic data from the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program

through a U-Net based image synthesis pipeline. HuBMAP channels were
hierarchically clustered by the (SSIM) as a heuristic to obtain the minimal set
needed to recapitulate the underlying biology represented by the spatial
landscape of proteins. We subsequently prove that our SSIM based architecture
allows for scaling of generative image synthesis to slides with up to 100
channels, which is better than current state of the art algorithms which are
limited to data with 11 channels. We validate these claims by generating a new
experimental spatial proteomics data set from human lung adenocarcinoma tissue
sections and show that a model trained on HuBMAP can accurately synthesize
channels from our new data set. The ability to recapitulate experimental data
from sparsely stained multiplexed histological slides containing spatial
proteomic will have tremendous impact on medical diagnostics and drug
development, and also raises important questions on the medical ethics of
utilizing data produced by generative image synthesis in the clinical setting.
The algorithm that we present in this paper will allow researchers and

future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly
limited by decoherence arising from local 'environmental' interactions.
Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple
functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the
possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new
time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics
could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but -- on the other hand -- the
ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable
sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is
suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic
proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we
study a general, fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating
environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially
remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated
into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient
excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by
system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream'
kinetics of a 'functional' quantum system. With access to complete
system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes
underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be
exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.

there has been a lot of research to automatically generate regexes from

regexes faster from positive and negative strings by relying on a novel
approach called `neural example splitting'. Our approach essentially split up
each example string into multiple parts using a neural network trained to group
similar substrings from positive strings. This helps to learn a regex faster
and, thus, more accurately since we now learn from several short-length
strings. We propose an effective regex synthesis framework called `SplitRegex'
that synthesizes subregexes from `split' positive substrings and produces the
final regex by concatenating the synthesized subregexes. For the negative
sample, we exploit pre-generated subregexes during the subregex synthesis
process and perform the matching against negative strings. Then the final regex
becomes consistent with all negative strings. SplitRegex is a
divided-and-conquer framework for learning target regexes; split (=divide)
positive strings and infer partial regexes for multiple parts, which is much
more accurate than the whole string inferring, and concatenate (=conquer)
inferred regexes while satisfying negative strings. We empirically demonstrate
that the proposed SplitRegex framework substantially improves the previous
regex synthesis approaches over four benchmark datasets.

to a large class of static spherically symmetric black holes, are considered
here. It has been realized recently that an atom falling into a black hole
leads to the generation of acceleration radiation through virtual transitions.
In recent studies, it has been argued that this acceleration radiation can be
understood from the near horizon physics of the black hole. The near horizon
approximation leads to conformal symmetry in the problem. We go beyond the near
horizon approximation in our analysis. This breaks the conformal symmetry
associated with the near horizon physics of the black hole geometry. We observe
that even without the consideration of the conformal symmetry, the modified
equivalence relation holds. Further, our analysis reveals that the probability
of virtual transition retains its Planck like form with the amplitude getting
modified due to the beyond near horizon approximation. For the next part of our
analysis, we have observed the horizon brightened acceleration radiation
entropy (HBAR) for a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) black hole. We observe
that the HBAR entropy misses out on quantum gravity like corrections while
considering the conformal case. However, such corrections emerge when the
conformal symmetry gets broken in the beyond near horizon analysis.

for the continual lifelong learning setting. The goal for the learner is to
sequentially learn new tasks where they come one after another over time and
the learner ensures the statistic parity of the new coming task across
different protected sub-populations (e.g. race and gender). A major drawback of
existing methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data
and hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static
regret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are
sampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online
learning problem in changing environments, in this paper, we first construct a
novel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a
strongly adapted loss regret. Furthermore, to determine a good model parameter
at each round, we propose a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning
algorithm, namely FairSAOML, which is able to adapt to changing environments in
both bias control and model precision. The problem is formulated in the form of
a bi-level convex-concave optimization with respect to the model's primal and
dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness,
respectively. The theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for both
loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints. Our experimental
evaluation on different real-world datasets with settings of changing
environments suggests that the proposed FairSAOML significantly outperforms
alternatives based on the best prior online learning approaches.

Aubry-Andr\'{e} model (Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma's model) has been set up. In
this work we propose that the critical region can be realized in a
one-dimensional flat band lattice system with a quasi-periodic potential. It is
found that the above flat band lattice model can be reduced into an effective
Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma's model where the effective parameter
$\alpha=V_0/(2E)$ with potential strength $V_0$ and eigenenergy $E$. It is
shown that there are very rich physics in this model. Depending on $|\alpha|<1$
or $|\alpha|\geq1$, the effective quasi-periodic potential would be bounded or
unbounded. For these two cases, the Lyapunov exponent [$\gamma(E)$], mobility
edges ($E_c$) and critical indices ($\nu$) of localized length are obtained
exactly. In addition, several localized state regions, extended state regions
and critical regions would appear in the parameter $V_0-E$ plane. For a given
potential strength $V_0$, the localized-extended and localized-critical
transitions can co-exist. Furthermore, we find the critical index of localized
length $\xi(E)=1/\gamma(E)$ is $\nu=1$ near localized-extended transitions and
$\nu=1/2$ near the localized-critical transitions. Near the transition point
between the bound ($|\alpha|<1$) and unbounded ($|\alpha|\geq1$) cases, i.e,
$|\alpha|=|V_0/(2E)|= 1$, the derivative of Lypunov exponent of localized
states with respect to energy is discontinuous. The localized states in bounded
and unbounded cases can be distinguished from each other by Avila's
acceleration. At the end, we find that near the transition point, there also
exist critical-extended transitions in the phase diagram.

the brain may suggest a simpler method of learning clusters directly from
random walks. Drawing inspiration from the hippocampus, we describe a simple
two-layer neural learning framework. Neurons in one layer are associated with
graph nodes and simulate random walks. These simulations cause neurons in the
second layer to become tuned to graph clusters through simple associative
learning. We show that if these neuronal interactions are modelled a particular
way, the system is essentially a variant of K-Means clustering applied directly
in the walk-space, bypassing the usual step of computing node
distances/similarities. The result is an efficient graph clustering method.

mimics the conventional RM with $\alpha =2$ for small phase shifts, but can be
as small as $\alpha =1$. In interpreting observations the frequency scaling of
polarization parameters should be fitted independently. The model offers
explanations for (i) large circular polarization component observed in FRBs,
with right-left switching; (ii) large RM, with possible sign changes; (iii)
time-depend variable polarization. Relatively dense and slow wind is needed -
the corresponding effect in regular pulsars is small.

random material and geometric properties is proposed within this work. In the
macroscopic failure mechanics, materials properties and exactness of spatial
quantities (of different phases in the geometrical domain) are assumed to be
homogeneous and deterministic. This is unlike the lower-scale with strong
fluctuation in the material and geometrical properties. Such a response is
approximated through some uncertainty in the model problem. The presented
contribution is devoted to providing a mathematical framework for modeling
uncertainty through stochastic analysis of a microstructure undergoing
brittle/ductile failure. Hereby, the proposed model employs various
representative volume elements with random distribution of stiff-inclusions and
voids within the composite structure. We develop an allocating strategy to
allocate the heterogeneities and generate the corresponding meshes in two- and
three-dimensional cases. Then the Monte Carlo finite element technique is
employed for solving the stochastic PDE-based model and approximate the
expectation and the variance of the solution field of brittle/ductile failure
by evaluating a large number of samples. For the prediction of failure
mechanisms, we rely on the phase-field approach which is a widely adopted
framework for modeling and computing the fracture phenomena in solids.
Incremental perturbed minimization principles for a class of gradient-type
dissipative materials are used to derive the perturbed governing equations.
This analysis enables us to study the highly heterogeneous microstructure and
monitor the uncertainty in failure mechanics. Several numerical examples are
given to examine the efficiency of the proposed method.

acts as the working substance interacting with a massless quantum scalar field,
with the boundary obeying the Dirichlet condition. The quantum vacuum serves as
a thermal bath through the Unruh effect. We observe that the response function
of the qubit gets significantly modified by the presence of the reflecting
boundary. From the structure of the correlation function, we find that three
different cases emerge, namely, the intermediate boundary regime, the near
boundary regime, and the far boundary regime. As expected, the correlation in
the far boundary regime approaches that of the Unruh quantum Otto engine (UQOE)
when the reflecting boundary goes to infinity. The effect of the reflecting
boundary is manifested through the reduction of the critical excitation
probability of the qubit and the work output of the engine. In spite of the
reduced work output, the efficiency of the engine remains unaltered even in the

that Empirical Law 1 can be converted from a heuristic to a theorem. A second
ancient empirical law is that the distance in kilometers from the observer to
the North Pole, the geodesic distance measured along the spherical surface of
the planet, is the number of degrees of colatitude multiplied by 111.1
kilometers. Can Empirical Law 2 be similarly rendered rigorous? No; whereas as
the shape of the planet is controlled by trigonometry, the size of our world is
an accident of cosmological history. However, Empirical Law 2, can be
rigorously verified by measurements. The association of 111 km of north-south
distance to one degree of latitude trivially yields the circumference of the

unified representation of different ViT architectures for systematic

those well-performing ViT ANNs are similar to real biological neural networks

the first time, propose a unified and biologically-plausible relational graph

representation consists of two key sub-graphs: aggregation graph and affine
graph. The former one considers ViT tokens as nodes and describes their spatial
interaction, while the latter one regards network channels as nodes and
reflects the information communication between channels. Using this unified
relational graph representation, we found that: a) a sweet spot of the
aggregation graph leads to ViTs with significantly improved predictive
performance; b) the graph measures of clustering coefficient and average path
length are two effective indicators of model prediction performance, especially
when applying on the datasets with small samples; c) our findings are
consistent across various ViT architectures and multiple datasets; d) the
