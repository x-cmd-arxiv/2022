hyperbolic 2-dimensional spacetimes, we identify the subalgebras of a given

a Cauchy surface, for both the classical and the quantised theory, and it is
shown that they then embed naturally into the algebra of the full theory.
Finally, it is demonstrated that the construction of these subalgebras is
independent of the choice of Cauchy surface and that they unambiguously define
a covariant theory on the spaces of null-geodesics.

massively annotated data, which, in many cases, are expensive or difficult to
collect. This has led to an emerging research interest in semi-supervised
learning (SSL) for 3D point cloud. It is commonly assumed in SSL that the
unlabeled data are drawn from the same distribution as that of the labeled
ones; This assumption, however, rarely holds true in realistic environments.
Blindly using out-of-distribution (OOD) unlabeled data could harm SSL
performance. In this work, we propose to selectively utilize unlabeled data
through sample weighting, so that only conducive unlabeled data would be
prioritized. To estimate the weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization
framework which iteratively optimizes a metaobjective on a held-out validation
set and a task-objective on a training set. Faced with the instability of
efficient bi-level optimizers, we further propose three regularization
techniques to enhance the training stability. Extensive experiments on 3D point
cloud classification and segmentation tasks verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method. We also demonstrate the feasibility of a more efficient
training strategy.

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7 (0.86 mm; 347 GHz). In spite of

During our observation, the sun was practically devoid of active regions. Quiet
Sun structures on the disk are similar to those in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) images at 1600 A and 304 A, after the latter are smoothed to the ALMA
resolution, as noted previously for Band 6 (1.26 mm) and Band 3 (3 mm) images;
they are also similar to negative H$\alpha$ images of equivalent resolution.
Polar coronal holes, which are clearly seen in the 304 A band and small
H$\alpha$ filaments, are not detectable at 0.86 mm. We computed the
center-to-limb variation (CLV) of the brightness temperature, $T_b$, in Band 7,

we combined them to a unique curve of $T_b(\log\mu_{100})$, where $\mu_{100}$
is the cosine of the heliocentric angle reduced to 100 GHz. Assuming that the
absolute calibration of the Band 3 commissioning observations is accurate, we
deduced a brightness temperature at the center of the disk of 6085 K for Band
7, instead of the value of 5500 K, extrapolated from the recommended values for
Bands 3 and 6. More importantly, the $T_b(\log\mu_{100})$ curve flattens at
large values of $\mu_{100}$, and so does the corresponding

for the number of radio-flaring ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) that are likely to be

unbiased, targeted radio surveys in the literature, we derive a detection rate
of $\ge$3%. Assuming a flat radio spectrum $\nu L _{\nu}\propto \nu^{\beta+1} $
with $\beta$ = -1.0 for UCD flares, we construct a flare luminosity function $d
N/d L \propto L^{-1.96 \pm 0.45}$ (here $L=\nu L_\nu$). CRAFTS is found to be
sensitive enough for flares from UCDs up to $\sim$180 pc. Considering the
Galactic thin disk, we carry out a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of the UCD
population, which is then fed to mock CRAFTS observations. We estimate that
$\sim$170 flaring UCDs would be detected through transient searches in circular
polarization. Though only marginally sensitive to the scale height of UCDs, the
results are very sensitive to the assumed spectral index $\beta$. For $\beta$
from 0 to -2.5, the number of expected detections increases dramatically from
$\sim$20 to $\sim$3460. We also contemplate the strategies for following up

a mechanism of immune escape that serves as an alternative to the standard
mechanism of escape by continuous genomic diversification and allows to explain
a number of experimental observations associated with the establishment of
chronic infections by highly mutable viruses. Within this mechanism, the
topology of a cross-immunoreactivity network forces intra-host viral variants
to specialize for complementary roles and adapt to host's immune response as a
quasi-social ecosystem. Here we study dynamical changes in immune adaptation
caused by evolutionary and epidemiological events. First, we show that the
emergence of a viral variant with altered antigenic features may result in a
rapid re-arrangement of the viral ecosystem and a change in the roles played by
existing viral variants. In particular, it may push the population under immune
escape by genomic diversification towards the stable state of adaptation by
antigenic cooperation. Next, we study the effect of a viral transmission
between two chronically infected hosts, which results in merging of two
intra-host viral populations in the state of stable immune-adapted equilibrium.
In this case, we also describe how the newly formed viral population adapts to
the host's environment by changing the functions of its members. The results
are obtained analytically for minimal cross-immunoreactivity networks and
numerically for larger populations.

Q branch that are moving anomalously fast for a local disc population with
their young photometric ages. As the velocity dispersion of stars in the local
disc increases with age, a proposed explanation of these white dwarfs is that
they experience a cooling delay that causes current cooling models to infer
photometric ages much younger than their true ages. To explore this
explanation, we investigate the kinematics of ultramassive white dwarfs within
200 pc of the Sun using the improved Gaia Early Data Release 3 observations. We
analyse the transverse motions of 0.95 - 1.25 $M_\odot$ white dwarfs,
subdivided by mass and age, and determine the distributions of the
three-dimensional components of the transverse velocities. The results are
compared to expectations based on observed kinematics of local main-sequence
stars. We find a population of photometrically young ($\sim$ 0.5 - 1.5 Gyr)
ultramassive ($\sim$ 1.15 - 1.25 $M_\odot$) white dwarfs for which the
transverse velocity component in the direction of Galactic rotation is more
dispersed than for local disc stars of any age; thus, it is too dispersed to be
explained by any cooling delay in white dwarfs originating from the local disc.
Furthermore, the dispersion ratio of the velocity components in the Galactic
plane for this population is also inconsistent with a local disc origin. We
discuss some possible explanations of this kinematically anomalous population,
such as a halo origin or production through dynamical effects of stellar triple
systems.

Currently, the only feasible solutions that exist are for special cases such as
the Wishart or G-Wishart, in moderate dimensions. We develop an approach based
on a novel telescoping block decomposition of the precision matrix that allows
the estimation of evidence by application of Chib's technique under a very

are: (a) the priors on the diagonal terms on the precision matrix can be
written as gamma or scale mixtures of gamma random variables and (b) those on
the off-diagonal terms can be represented as normal or scale mixtures of
normal. This includes structured priors such as the Wishart or G-Wishart, and
more recently introduced element-wise priors, such as the Bayesian graphical
lasso and the graphical horseshoe. Among these, the true marginal is known in
an analytically closed form for Wishart, providing a useful validation of our
approach. For the general setting of the other three, and several more priors

accurate forecasting of storm events provides unique opportunities to shift
flood management practices from static approaches to an optimization-based
real-time control (RTC) of urban drainage systems. Recent studies have
addressed a plethora of strategies for flood control in stormwater reservoirs;
however, advanced control theoretic techniques are not yet fully investigated
and applied to these systems. In addition, there is an absence of a coupled
integrated control model for systems composed of watersheds, reservoirs, and
channels for flood mitigation.
  To this end, we develop a novel state-space model of hydrologic and
hydrodynamic processes in reservoirs and one-dimensional channels. The model is
tested under different types of reservoir control strategies based on real-time
measurements (reactive control), and based on predictions of the future
behavior of the system (predictive control) using rainfall forecastings. We
apply the modeling approach in a system composed by a single watershed,
reservoir, and a channel connected in series, respectively, for the San Antonio
observed rainfall data. Results indicate that for flood mitigation, the
predictive control strategy outperforms the reactive controls not only when
applied for synthetic design storm events, but also for a continuous
simulation. Moreover, the predictive control strategy requires smaller valve
operations, while still guaranteeing efficient hydrological performance. From
the results, we recommend the use of the model predictive control strategy to
control stormwater systems due to the ability to handle different objective
functions, which can be altered according to rainfall forecasting and shift the
reservoir operation from flood-based control to strategies focused on
increasing detention times, depending on the forecasting.

decay can be hidden. In the original AIT model, the AIT ansatz is realized in
the minimal seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos which have a
hierarchical mass structure: the lighter and heavier right-handed neutrinos are
respectively much lighter and heavier than the typical Fermi-momentum scale of
nuclei. However, the original AIT model does not accommodate a successful
leptogenesis. For this problem, in this paper we study a split seesaw model
with one lighter right-handed neutrino but two heavier right-handed neutrinos
which can realize the AIT ansatz and accommodate a successful leptogenesis
simultaneously. We first give the condition on the neutrino Yukawa couplings
for realizing the AIT ansatz, discuss its realization by employing an Abelian
flavor symmetry, and study its implications for the mixing of the lighter
right-handed neutrino with three left-handed neutrinos. We then successively
study the implications for leptogenesis of the interesting scenarios where
$M^{}_{\rm D}$ is a triangular matrix (which has maximally-restricted texture
zeros, in line with the simplicity principle) or respects the $\mu$-$\tau$

  Entropy",,,"10.3390/e24050683",,"math.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Shannon's entropy is one of the building blocks of information theory and an
essential aspect of Machine Learning methods (e.g., Random Forests). Yet, it is
only finitely defined for distributions with fast decaying tails on a countable
alphabet. The unboundedness of Shannon's entropy over the general class of all
distributions on an alphabet prevents its potential utility from being fully
realized. To fill the void in the foundation of information theory, Zhang
(2020) proposed generalized Shannon's entropy, which is finitely defined
everywhere. The plug-in estimator, adopted in almost all entropy-based ML
method packages, is one of the most popular approaches to estimating Shannon's
entropy. The asymptotic distribution for Shannon's entropy's plug-in estimator
was well studied in the existing literature. This paper studies the asymptotic
properties for the plug-in estimator of generalized Shannon's entropy on
countable alphabets. The developed asymptotic properties require no assumptions
on the original distribution. The proposed asymptotic properties allow interval
estimation and statistical tests with generalized Shannon's entropy.

increasing other forms of sustainable travel (e.g., walking and cycling). In
this study we investigate various aspects of Scottish residents' climate change

investigate mode preferences for commuting trips in different working from home

be convinced that their travel choices can have an effect on climate change and
the spread of infectious diseases. The discrete choice experiment showed that
the use of cars for commuting is relatively consistent regardless of the

show that the realizability problem with NFA goals is EXPTIME-complete and with
AFA goals is 2EXPTIME-complete, thus establishing strict complexity gaps
between realizability with respect to DFA, NFA, and AFA goals. We then contrast
these complexity gaps with the complexity of the verification problem, where we

emission due to DM annihilation were computed in the frame of 2D galactic model
employing GALPROP code adapted specifically for M31. This enabled us to refine
various inaccuracies of previous studies on the subject. DM constraints were
obtained for two representative annihilation channels: $\chi\chi \rightarrow
b\overline{b}$ and $\chi\chi \rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$. A wide variety of radio
data was utilized in the frequency range $\approx$(0.1--10) GHz. As the result
the thermal WIMP lighter than fiducially $\approx$ 70 GeV for $b\overline{b}$

observations of dwarfs and AMS-02 measurements of antiprotons. Our constraints
do not exclude the explanation of the gamma-ray outer halo of M31 and the
Galactic center excess by annihilating DM. The thermal WIMP with $m_x \approx
70$ GeV, which explains the outer halo, would make a significant contribution
to the non-thermal radio flux in M31 nucleus, fitting well both the spectrum

velocity components are reused to compute the viscous fluxes for efficiency and
significantly improve the solution and gradient quality, as demonstrated by

identified as a critically important property for stable compressible-flow

discontinuities are captured using a monotonicity-preserving (MP) scheme, which
is also improved by reusing the gradients. For inviscid test cases, The
proposed scheme is fourth-order for linear and second-order accurate for
non-linear problems. Several numerical results obtained for simulations of
complex viscous flows are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness
of the proposed methodology.

intensity moment expansion to the spin-2 field of linear polarization: the

with various time lags of 150 ms, 200 ms, 250 ms, 300 ms, and 350 ms before the
movement onset are utilised for the same. The MTD is presented for
grasp-and-lift task (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset) using EEG with the various lags taken
as input to the neural decoders. The performance of the proposed decoders are
compared with the state-of-the-art multi-variable linear regression (mLR)

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is an attractive alternative approach
to traditional solvers due to its flexibility and ease of incorporating

variety of PDEs, the method still requires improvements in terms of
computational efficiency. One possible improvement idea is to optimize the
generation of training point sets. Residual-based adaptive sampling and
quasi-uniform sampling approaches have been each applied to improve the
training effects of PINNs, respectively. To benefit from both methods, we
propose the Residual-based Adaptive Node Generation (RANG) approach for
efficient training of PINNs, which is based on a variable density nodal
distribution method for RBF-FD. The method is also enhanced by a memory
mechanism to further improve training stability. We conduct experiments on
three linear PDEs and three nonlinear PDEs with various node generation
methods, through which the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method
compared to the predominant uniform sampling approach is verified numerically.

treatment on a rolling basis. While each treated unit has a specific time of
entry into the study, control units each have many possible comparison, or

2020) solves this problem by searching over all possible pseudo-treatment times
for each control and selecting those permitting the closest matches based on
covariate histories. However, valid methods of inference have been described
only for special cases of the general GroupMatch design, and these rely on
strong assumptions. We provide three important innovations to address these
problems. First, we introduce a new design, GroupMatch with instance
replacement, that allows additional flexibility in control selection and proves
more amenable to analysis. Second, we propose a block bootstrap approach for
inference in GroupMatch with instance replacement and demonstrate that it
accounts properly for complex correlations across matched sets. Third, we
develop a permutation-based falsification test to detect possible violations of
the important timepoint agnosticism assumption underpinning GroupMatch, which
requires homogeneity of potential outcome means across time. Via simulation and
a case study of the impact of short-term injuries on batting performance in

picture for the nerve pulse is of thermodynamic nature. It considers the nerve
pulse as a soliton, i.e., a macroscopic excited region with properties that are
influenced by thermodynamic variables including voltage, temperature, pressure

strictly coupled. We discuss the consequences for medical treatment in a view
where one can compensate a maladjustment of one variable by adjusting another

hydrostatic pressure and decrease in pH, suggest reasons why lithium over-dose
may lead to tremor, and how tremor is related to alcohol intoxication. Lithium

polarization is related to the azimuthal angle in the Compton scattering
process, so the initial correlation of polarizations of the annihilation quanta
translates to the correlation of the azimuthal angles in events where both
annihilation photons undergo Compton scattering. This results in a modulated
distribution of the azimuthal angle difference for true events, while this
modulation is lacking for the background events. We present a comprehensive
experimental study of five detector configurations based on scintillator
matrices and silicon photomultipliers, suitable for measuring the azimuthal
modulation. The modules consist of either GaGG:Ce or LYSO:Ce pixels with sizes
varying from 1.9x1.9x20 $\mathrm{mm^3}$ to 3x3x20 $\mathrm{mm^3}$. The
distinctive feature of the modules is that they can reconstruct the Compton
scattering by detecting the recoil electron and the scattered gamma in a single
detector layer, which simplifies extension to larger systems. The amplitude
modulation of the azimuthal angles' difference is clearly observable in all

of bonding is covalent bonding especially important. Characteristic for
covalent bonding are small atom groups with short distances between the
involved atoms, indicating that covalent bonding is essentially a local effect,
according to Lewis, this is caused by shared electron pairs. However, the
energetic stabilization is an approximately additive one-electron effect, as
was shown by Ruedenberg and coworkers. In systems composed of many-electron
subsystems, the fermionic character of the electrons determines the structure
of the electron distribution in a subsystem, and it is decisive for the local
interactions between the subsystems. Especially important is the Pauli
exclusion principle (PEP), which directs the relative positions of identical
electrons. Spin and charge rearrangements are of utmost importance for chemical
bonding. Quantum chemical methods like CASSCF (complete active space SCF), also
called FORS (fully optimized reaction space), are made to cover all such
processes. The standard building blocks of CASSCF wave functions are
delocalized molecular orbitals, which cannot display local effects. OVB

reveal local processes that are responsible for both the energetic aspects of

analyzing dissociation of ethene, disilene, and silaethene, and the
corresponding reverse reactions. Aspects of diabaticity of the reactions and

system matrix is shift invariant and in turn a single matrix suffices for image
reconstruction significantly reducing the calibration time and reconstruction
effort. For large field imperfections, however, the method can lead to severe
image artifacts. In the present work we generalize the efficient multi-patch
reconstruction to work under non-ideal field conditions, where shift invariance
holds only approximately for small shifts of the sub-volume. Patches are
clustered based on a magnetic-field-based metric such that in each cluster the
shift invariance holds in good approximation. The total number of clusters is
the main parameter of our method and allows to trade off calibration time and
image artifacts. The magnetic-field-based metric allows to perform the
clustering without prior knowledge of the system matrices. The developed
reconstruction algorithm is evaluated on a multi-patch measurement sequence
with 15 patches, where efficient multi-patch reconstruction with a single
calibration measurement leads to strong image artifacts. Analysis reveals that
calibration measurements can be decreased from 15 to 11 with no visible image
artifacts. A further reduction to 9 is possible with only slight degradation in

the neutrino mass-squared differences and the values of the mixing angles,
rendering the DSNB energy spectrum sensitive to variations of these parameters.
Considering a purely phenomenological parameterization of the neutrino masses
as a function of redshift, we compute the expected local DSNB spectrum here on
Earth. Given the current knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters,
specially the fact that $|U_{e3}|^2$ is small, we find that the $\nu_e$
spectrum could be significantly different from standard expectations if
neutrinos were effectively massless at $z\gtrsim1$ as long as the neutrino mass
ordering is normal. On the other hand, the $\overline{\nu}_e$ flux is not
expected to be significantly impacted. Hence, a measurement of both the

median $\langle P_{154\mu m} \rangle = 3.3\pm0.9 $% across the disks. We report
the first polarized spectrum of starburst galaxies showing a minimum within

decrease in the dust grain alignment efficiency produced by variations in dust
temperatures along the line-of-sight in the galactic outflow. We find that the
starburst galaxies and the star-forming regions within normal galaxies have the
lowest polarization fractions. We find that 50% (7 out of 14) of the galaxies

three different trends. Group 1 has a relative increase of anisotropic random
B-fields produced by compression or shear of B-fields in the galactic outflows,
starburst rings, and inner-bar of galaxies; and Groups 2 and 3 have a relative
increase of isotropic random B-fields driven by star-forming regions in the
spiral arms, and/or an increase of dust grain alignment efficiency caused by
shock-driven regions or evolutionary stages of a galaxy.

Jet flavour definitions have been presented in the literature, but they are
typically defined through modification of the jet algorithm to be sensitive to
partonic flavour at every stage of the clustering. While this does ensure that
the sum of flavours in a jet is IRC safe, a flavour-sensitive clustering
procedure is difficult to apply to realistic data. We introduce a distinct and

of all partons that remain after Soft Drop grooming, reclustered with the Jade

next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), and so can interface with the most
precise fixed-order calculations for jets available at present. We validate the
IRC safety of this definition with numeric fixed-order codes and further show
that jet flavour with Soft Drop reclustered with a generalised kT algorithm

nature of dark matter and potential modifications of the theory of gravity on
large scales. The $\Lambda$CDM paradigm makes strong predictions on the shape
of dark matter halos and on the dependence of the shape parameters on halo
mass, such that any deviation from the predicted universal shape would have
important implications for the fundamental properties of dark matter. Here we
use a set of 12 galaxy clusters with available deep X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich
data to constrain the shape of the gravitational field with an unprecedented
level of precision over two decades in radius. On average, we find that the NFW
profile provides an excellent description of the recovered mass profiles, with
deviations of less than 10% over a wide radial range. However, there appears to
be more diversity in the shape of individual profiles than can be captured by
the NFW model. The average NFW concentration and its scatter agree very well
with the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. For a subset of systems, we
disentangle the gravitational field into the contribution of baryonic
components (gas, brightest cluster galaxy, and satellite galaxies) and that of
dark matter. The stellar content dominates the gravitational field inside
$\sim0.02R_{500}$ but is responsible for only 1-2% of the total gravitational
field inside $R_{200}$. The total baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value at
$R_{200}$ and slightly exceeds it beyond this point, possibly indicating a mild
level of nonthermal pressure support ($10-20\%$) in cluster outskirts. Finally,
the relation between observed and baryonic acceleration exhibits a complex
shape that strongly departs from the radial acceleration relation in spiral
galaxies, which shows that the aforementioned relation does not hold at the

a fairly stable flux ($f_{\rm2-10}\simeq4-5.5\times10^{-13}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$)
from 2000 to 2008, APM 08279+5255 was found in a fainter state in the latest
X-ray exposures ($f_{\rm2-10}\simeq2.7\times10^{-13}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$), which can
likely be ascribed to a lower X-ray activity. Moreover, the 2019 data present a
prominent Fe K$\alpha$ emission line and do not show any significant absorption
line. This fainter state, coupled to the first hard X-ray sampling of APM
08279+5255, allowed us to measure X-ray reflection and the high-energy cutoff
in this source for the first time. From the analysis of previous XMM-Newton and
Chandra observations, X-ray reflection is demonstrated to be a long-lasting
feature of this source, but less prominent prior to 2008, possibly due to a
stronger primary emission. The estimated high-energy cutoff ($E_{\rm
cut}=99_{-35}^{+91}$ keV) sets a new redshift record for the farthest ever
measured and places APM 08279+5255 in the allowed region of the
compactness-temperature diagram of X-ray coronae, in agreement with previous
results on high-$z$ quasars.

lepton sector. The generalized lepton sector is also flavor conserving but with
the new Yukawa couplings completely decoupled from lepton mass proportionality.
The model is one loop stable under renormalization group evolution and it
allows to reproduce the $g-2$ muon anomaly together with the different
scenarios one can consider for the electron $g-2$ anomaly, related to the
Cesium and/or to the Rubidium recoil measurements of the fine structure
constant. Thorough parameter space analyses are performed to constrain all the
model parameters in the different scenarios, either including or not including
the recent CDF measurement of the W boson mass. For light new scalars with
masses in the $0.2$-$1.0$ TeV range, the muon anomaly receives dominant one
loop contributions; it is for heavy new scalars with masses above $1.2$ TeV
that two loop Barr-Zee diagrams are needed. The electron $g-2$ anomaly, if any,
must always be obtained with the two loop contributions. The final allowed
regions are quite sensitive to the assumptions about perturbativity of Yukawa
couplings, which influence unexpected observables like the allowed scalar mass
ranges. On that respect, intermediate scalar masses, highly constrained by
direct LHC searches, are allowed provided that the new lepton Yukawa couplings
are fully scrutinized, including values up to 250 GeV. In the framework of a
complete model, fully numerically analysed, we show the implications of the
recent $M_{W}$ measurement.

total, this analysis used 4289 standard-star spectra taken on photometric

wavelength-by-wavelength calibration for all nights simultaneously with a
Bayesian hierarchical model, thereby enabling a consistent treatment of the
Type Ia supernova cosmology analysis and the calibration on which it critically
relies. We determine the typical per-observation repeatability (median 14 mmag

(median dispersion of 7 mmag with uncertainty 1 mmag), and the scatter internal
to our CALSPEC reference stars (median of 8 mmag). We also check our standards
against literature filter photometry, finding generally good agreement over the

strong force becomes a free theory and a jet consists of a single parton.
However, measurements are performed in the infrared, where a jet consists of
numerous particles and requires an algorithmic procedure to define their phase
space boundaries. To connect these two regimes, we introduce a novel and simple
partonic jet flavor definition in the infrared. We define the jet flavor to be
the net flavor of the partons that lie exactly along the direction of the
Winner-Take-All recombination scheme axis of the jet, which is safe to all
orders under emissions of soft particles, but is not collinear safe. Collinear
divergences can be absorbed into a perturbative fragmentation function that
describes the evolution of the jet flavor from the ultraviolet to the infrared.
The evolution equations are linear and a small modification to traditional
DGLAP and we solve them to leading-logarithmic accuracy. The evolution
equations exhibit fixed points in the deep infrared, we demonstrate
quantitative agreement with parton shower simulations, and we present various
infrared and collinear safe observables that are sensitive to this flavor
definition.

branching ratios for several rare $K$ and $B$ decays, in particular for the
decays $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$, $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^+$ and
$B_d\to\mu^+\mu^+$. On the theory side a very significant progress on
calculating these branching ratios has been achieved in the last thirty years
culminating recently in rather precise SM predictions for them. It is then
unfortunate that some papers still cite the results for $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$
and $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ presented by us in 2015. They are clearly out of
date. Similar comments apply to predictions for $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$. In this
note I want to stress again that, in view of the tensions between various
determinations of $V_{cb}$ in tree-level decays, presently, the only trustable
SM predictions for the branching ratios in question can be obtained by
eliminating their dependence on the CKM parameters with the help of
$|\varepsilon_K|$, $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$, evaluated in
the SM. In this context I am astonished by statements made by some computer
code practitioners that setting in this strategy these four $\Delta F=2$
observables to their experimental values is an assumption. The goal of this
strategy is not to make an overall SM fit but to predict the SM branching
ratios. In the SM there are no new physics (NP) contributions to $\Delta F=2$
transitions and no assumption on the absence of NP is needed. Moreover,
presently NP is not required to describe simultaneously the very precise data
on $|\varepsilon_K|$, $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$. This
strategy for obtaining true SM predictions for rare decay branching ratios is
moreover not polluted by hadronic uncertainies and observed anomalies in
semi-leptonic decays used often in global analyses as stressed recently in
(arxiv: 2209.03968).

gate set consisting of the CNOT gate and arbitrary single-qubit (1q) gates with
the primary target being the minimization of the CNOT count. First we note that
along with the discrete architecture search suffering from the combinatorial
explosion of complexity, optimization over 1q gates can also be a crucial
roadblock due to the omnipresence of local minimums (well known in the context
of variational quantum algorithms but apparently underappreciated in the
context of the variational compiling). Taking the issue seriously, we make an
extensive search over the initial conditions an essential part of our approach.
Another key idea we propose is to use parametrized two-qubit (2q) controlled
phase gates, which can interpolate between the identity gate and the CNOT gate,
and allow a continuous relaxation of the discrete architecture search, which
can be executed jointly with the optimization over 1q gates. This coherent
optimization of the architecture together with 1q gates appears to work
surprisingly well in practice, sometimes even outperforming optimization over
1q gates alone (for fixed optimal architectures). As illustrative examples and
applications we derive 8 CNOT and T depth 3 decomposition of the 3q Toffoli
gate on the nearest-neighbor topology, rediscover known best decompositions of
the 4q Toffoli gate on all 4q topologies including a 1 CNOT gate improvement on
the star-shaped topology, and propose decomposition of the 5q Toffoli gate on
the nearest-neighbor topology with 48 CNOT gates. We also benchmark the
performance of our approach on a number of 5q quantum circuits from the
ibm_qx_mapping database showing that it is highly competitive with the existing

of protocols for reverting unknown unitaries in scenarios where even the

universal rewinding protocols is limited by their probabilistic nature, raising
the fundamental question of whether time-reversal could be performed
deterministically. Here we show that quantum physics indeed allows for
deterministic universal time-reversal by exploiting the non-commuting nature of
quantum operators, and demonstrate a recursive protocol for two-level quantum
systems with an arbitrarily high probability of success. Using a photonic
platform we demonstrate our protocol, reverting the discrete time evolution of
a polarization state with an average state fidelity of over 95%. Our protocol,
requiring no knowledge of the quantum process to be rewound, is optimal in its
running time, and brings quantum rewinding into a regime of practical

the smallest dwarf galaxies or the most massive galaxy clusters alike.
Conversely, if dark matter particles self-interact via additional forces, we
expect the mass density profiles of DM halos to flatten in their central

structural properties of the 12 massive X-COP galaxy clusters from observations
of their hot gaseous atmosphere using the X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, and of
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect using the Planck all-sky survey. After removing

$\sigma_{\alpha}=0.06$, in close agreement with the prediction of the cold dark

formation with self-interacting DM (BAHAMAS-SIDM) to determine how the Einasto
shape parameter depends on the self-interaction cross section. We use the
fitted relation to turn our measurements of $\alpha$ into constraints on the
self-interaction cross section, which imply $\sigma/m < 0.19$ cm$^2$/g (95%
confidence level) at collision velocity $v_\mathrm{DM-DM}\sim1,000$ km/s. This
is lower than the interaction cross-section required for dark matter

spectrometer of ESA's Athena X-ray observatory. It will deliver X-ray data in
the 0.2-12 keV band with an unprecedented spectral resolution of 2.5 eV up to 7
keV. During the observation of very bright X-ray sources, the X-IFU detectors
will receive high photon rates. The count rate capability of the X-IFU will be
improved by using the defocusing option, which will enable the observations of
extremely bright sources with fluxes up to $\simeq 1$ Crab. In the defocused
mode, the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope will be spread over a
large number of pixels. In this case, each pixel receives a small fraction of
the overall flux. Due to the energy dependence of the PSF, this mode will
generate energy dependent artefacts increasing with count rate if not analysed
properly. To account for the degradation of the energy resolution with pulse
separation in a pixel, a grading scheme (here four grades) will be defined to
affect the proper energy response to each event. This will create selection
effects preventing the use of the nominal Auxiliary Response File (ARF) for all
events. We present a new method for the reconstruction of the spectra obtained
from observations performed with a PSF that varies as a function of energy. We
apply our method to the case of the X-IFU spectra obtained during the defocused

(XRBs) and may contribute significantly to the redshift-dependent X-ray
emission from star forming galaxies. We have assembled a uniform sample of 259
ULXs over the redshift range z=0.002-0.51 to constrain their physical nature
and their contribution to the Cosmic X-Ray Background (CXB). The sample is
constructed by crossmatching galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with
the Chandra Source Catalog and selecting off-nuclear X-ray sources after
applying astrometric corrections. The fraction of contaminants is ~30% and
shows no evolution with redshift. The host galaxy star formation rates (SFRs)
are systematically elevated relative to the parent sample when matched in host
stellar mass. The specific SFRs suggest a slight preference for high-mass XRBs,
and the X-ray luminosity scaling relations with host galaxy stellar mass and
SFR indicate that the highest redshift sources represent relatively luminous
XRB populations that dominate their host galaxy X-ray emission. The fraction of
galaxies hosting at least one ULX of a given luminosity increases with redshift
over the full range of our sample, as expected if ULXs are preferentially found
in galaxies with high SFRs and low metallicities. At z~0.5, the ULX X-ray flux
is consistent with the X-ray emission from star-forming galaxies. Moreover,
ULXs may account for up to ~40% of the integrated flux from XRBs in the normal
galaxy population out to z~0.5, suggesting they may contribute significantly to
the overall ionizing radiation from galaxies.

originate due to the coupling of the out-of-equilibrium modes with the

are notoriously challenging to solve. Recently, Liu et al. [1] demonstrated the
first efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic differential
equations under the condition $R < 1$, where $R$ measures the ratio of
nonlinearity to dissipation using the $\ell_2$ norm. Here we develop an
efficient quantum algorithm based on [1] for reaction-diffusion equations, a
class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve this, we
improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a
faster convergence rate under the condition $R_D < 1$, where $R_D$ measures the
ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Since
$R_D$ is independent of the number of spatial grid points $n$ while $R$
increases with $n$, the criterion $R_D<1$ is significantly milder than $R<1$
for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for
approximating PDEs. As applications of our quantum algorithm we consider the
Fisher-KPP and Allen-Cahn equations, which have interpretations in classical
physics. In particular, we show how to estimate the mean square kinetic energy
in the solution by postprocessing the quantum state that encodes it to extract

handed neutrinos ($\nu_R$), a Dirac fermion DM candidate ($\psi$) and a complex
scalar ($\phi$), transforming non-trivially under an unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_4$
symmetry while being singlets under the SM gauge group. While DM and $\nu_R$
couplings are considered to be tiny in order to be in the non-thermal or
freeze-in regime, $\phi$ can be produced either thermally or non-thermally
depending upon the strength of its Higgs portal coupling. We consider both
these possibilities and find out the resulting DM abundance via freeze-in
mechanism to constrain the model parameters in the light of Planck 2018 data.

check the enhanced contribution to the effective relativistic degrees of
freedom $\Delta {\rm N}_{\rm eff}$ in view of existing bounds as well as future
sensitivities. We also check the stringent constraints on free-streaming length
of such freeze-in DM from structure formation requirements. Such constraints

being analyzed regarding the following parameters: Axial length, tangential

development can be quantified based on visual wear characteristics. In
addition, using the dedicated camera system, the actual course of the growth

represents a population, a very appealing solution concept is lexicographic
maximality (leximax) which offers a natural (pareto-optimal like)
interpretation that the utility of no population can be increased without
decreasing the utility of a population that is already worse off. However,
finding a leximax solution can be highly dependent on small variations in the
utility of certain groups. In this work, we explore new notions of approximate
leximax solutions with three distinct motivations: better algorithmic
efficiency, exploiting significant utility improvements, and robustness to
noise. Among other definitional contributions, we give a new notion of an
approximate leximax that satisfies a similarly appealing semantic
interpretation and relate it to algorithmically-feasible approximate leximax
notions. When group utilities are linear over cohort candidates, we give an
efficient polynomial-time algorithm for finding a leximax distribution over
cohort candidates in the exact as well as in the approximate setting.
Furthermore, we show that finding an integer solution to leximax cohort

Analyzing compositional data such as human gut microbiomes needs a careful
treatment of the geometry of the data. A common geometrical understanding of
compositional data is via a regular simplex. Majority of existing approaches
rely on a log-ratio or power transformations to overcome the innate simplicial
geometry. In this work, based on the key observation that a compositional data
are projective in nature, and on the intrinsic connection between projective
and spherical geometry, we re-interpret the compositional domain as the
quotient topology of a sphere modded out by a group action. This
re-interpretation allows us to understand the function space on compositional
domains in terms of that on spheres and to use spherical harmonics theory along
with reflection group actions for constructing a compositional Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This construction of RKHS for compositional data
will widely open research avenues for future methodology developments. In
particular, well-developed kernel embedding methods can be now introduced to
compositional data analysis. The polynomial nature of compositional RKHS has
both theoretical and computational benefits. The wide applicability of the
proposed theoretical framework is exemplified with nonparametric density
estimation and kernel exponential family for compositional data.

simulated using molecular-dynamics. The central quantity of interest is the
mean lateral force, i.e., the kinetic friction rather than the maximum lateral
forces, which correlate with the static friction. For most set-ups, we find
Stokesian damping to resist sliding. However, velocity-insensitive (Coulomb)
friction is observed for finite-width slabs sliding parallel to the armchair
direction if the bottommost layer of the three graphite layers is kept at zero
stress rather than at zero displacement. Although the resulting kinetic
friction remain much below the noise produced by the erratic fluctuations of
(conservative) forces typical for structurally lubric contacts, the nature of
the instabilities leading to Coulomb friction could be characterized as
quasi-discontinuous dynamics of the Moir\'e patterns formed by the normal
displacements near a propagating contact line. It appears that the interaction
of the graphite with the second gold layer is responsible for the symmetry
breaking occurring in the interface when a contact line moves parallel to the

routinely traverse a variety of unstructured terrains. However, while gaits can
be varied typically by selecting from a range of pre-computed styles, current
planners are unable to vary key gait parameters continuously while the robot is
in motion. The synthesis, on-the-fly, of gaits with unexpected operational
characteristics or even the blending of dynamic manoeuvres lies beyond the
capabilities of the current state-of-the-art. In this work we address this
limitation by learning a latent space capturing the key stance phases
constituting a particular gait. This is achieved via a generative model trained
on a single trot style, which encourages disentanglement such that application
of a drive signal to a single dimension of the latent state induces holistic
plans synthesising a continuous variety of trot styles. We demonstrate that
specific properties of the drive signal map directly to gait parameters such as
cadence, footstep height and full stance duration. Due to the nature of our
approach these synthesised gaits are continuously variable online during robot
operation and robustly capture a richness of movement significantly exceeding
the relatively narrow behaviour seen during training. In addition, the use of a
generative model facilitates the detection and mitigation of disturbances to
provide a versatile and robust planning framework. We evaluate our approach on
two versions of the real ANYmal quadruped robots and demonstrate that our
method achieves a continuous blend of dynamic trot styles whilst being robust

proper valuations for residential and commercial properties has become crucial.
Past researchers have been known to utilize static real estate data (e.g.
number of beds, baths, square footage) or even a combination of real estate and
demographic information to predict property prices. In this investigation, we
attempted to improve upon past research. So we decided to explore a unique
approach: we wanted to determine if mobile location data could be used to
improve the predictive power of popular regression and tree-based models. To
prepare our data for our models, we processed the mobility data by attaching it
to individual properties from the real estate data that aggregated users within
500 meters of the property for each day of the week. We removed people that
lived within 500 meters of each property, so each property's aggregated
mobility data only contained non-resident census features. On top of these
dynamic census features, we also included static census features, including the
number of people in the area, the average proportion of people commuting, and
the number of residents in the area. Finally, we tested multiple models to
predict real estate prices. Our proposed model is two stacked random forest
modules combined using a ridge regression that uses the random forest outputs
as predictors. The first random forest model used static features only and the
second random forest model used dynamic features only. Comparing our models
with and without the dynamic mobile location features concludes the model with
dynamic mobile location features achieves 3/% percent lower mean squared error
than the same model but without dynamic mobile location features.

molecules beyond the range accessible to normal microscopes. However, several
aspects of the ZMW influence on the photophysics of fluorophores remain
inadequately documented and sometimes controversial. Here, we thoroughly
investigate the ZMW influence on the fluorescence of single immobilized Cy3B
and Alexa 647 molecules, detailing the interplays between brightness, lifetime,
photobleaching time, total number of emitted photons and F\""orster resonance
energy transfer (FRET). Despite the plasmonic-enhanced excitation intensity in
the ZMW, we find that the photostability is preserved with similar
photobleaching times as on the glass reference. Both the fluorescence
brightness and the total numbers of photons detected before photobleaching are
increased, with an impressive gain near five times found for Alexa 647 dyes.
Finally, the single-molecule data importantly allow a loophole-free
characterization of the ZMW influence on the FRET process. We show that the
FRET rate constant is enhanced by 50%, demonstrating that nanophotonics can
mediate the energy transfer. These results deepen our understanding of the
fluorescence enhancement in ZMWs and are of immediate relevance for
single-molecule biophysical applications.

cracks from concrete joints, leading to a high false-positive rate. It also
found that detecting cracks from concrete pavement images still has huge room

parts of cold, dense cores. Here we present high-resolution NH$_3$ observations
with the Very Large Array (VLA) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) towards a
prestellar core. These observations show an outer region with a fractional
NH$_3$ abundance of X(NH$_3$) = (1.975$\pm$0.005)$\times 10^{-8}$ ($\pm 10\%$
systematic), but it also reveals that after all, the X(NH$_3$) starts to
decrease above a H$_2$ column density of $\approx 2.6 \times 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$. We derive a density model for the core and find that the break-point
in the fractional abundance occurs at the density n(H$_2$) $\sim 2\times10^5$
cm$^{-3}$, and beyond this point the fractional abundance decreases with
increasing density, following the power law $n^{-1.1}$. This power-law behavior
is well reproduced by chemical models where adsorption onto grains dominates
the removal of ammonia and related species from the gas at high densities. We
suggest that the break-point density changes from core to core depending on the
temperature and the grain properties, but that the depletion power law is
anyway likely to be close to $n^{-1}$ owing to the dominance of accretion in
the central parts of starless cores.

MZR and SFR across the whole range of galaxy mass and metallicity has been
observed, where the slope changes seen in the O/H -- SFR plane present a
pattern which seems to be tuned to the galaxies' stellar age, and therefore,
stellar age has to be taken into account in the stellar mass -- metallicity --
SFR relation. In order to provide an answer to the question of whether or not
the MZR depends on the SFR it is essential to take into account the age of the
stellar populations of galaxies. A strong dependence between the MZR and SFR is
observed mainly for star-forming galaxies with strong SFR values and low
Dn(4000). The youngest galaxies of our SDSS sample show the highest SFR
measured for their stellar mass.

various observables on $n$ can be reabsorbed into a redefinition of the quench
parameter by a $\sqrt{n}$ prefactor. We also address the role of a
nearest-neighbor coupling between the external qubits.

  Communication Systems","168 pages, PhD thesis",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Innovation in the physical layer of communication systems has traditionally
been achieved by breaking down the transceivers into sets of processing blocks,
each optimized independently based on mathematical models. Conversely, deep
learning (DL)-based systems are able to handle increasingly complex tasks for
which no tractable models are available. This thesis aims at comparing
different approaches to unlock the full potential of DL in the physical layer.
  First, we describe a neural network (NN)-based block strategy, where an NN is
optimized to replace a block in a communication system. We apply this strategy
to introduce a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) detector
that builds on top of an existing DL-based architecture. Second, we detail an
end-to-end strategy, in which the transmitter and receiver are modeled as an
autoencoder. This approach is illustrated with the design of waveforms that
achieve high throughputs while satisfying peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) constraints. Lastly, we propose a
hybrid strategy, where multiple DL components are inserted into a traditional
architecture but are trained to optimize the end-to-end performance. To
demonstrate its benefits, we propose a DL-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver that both
enable lower bit error rates (BERs) compared to a conventional receiver and
remains scalable to any number of users.
  Each approach has its own strengths and shortcomings. While the first one is
the easiest to implement, its individual block optimization does not ensure the
overall system optimality. On the other hand, systems designed with the second
approach are computationally complex but allow for new opportunities such as
pilotless transmissions. Finally, the combined flexibility and end-to-end
performance gains of the third approach motivate its use for short-term
practical implementations.

stabilization. Our work examines the extent to which the CTC has done so. Our
study, which documents clear, consistent, and compelling evidence of gender
inequity in benefits realization, yields four key findings. First, stringent
requisite income thresholds disproportionally disadvantage single mothers, a
reflection of the high concentration of this demographic in lower segments of
the income distribution. Second, married parents and, to a lesser extent,
single fathers, are the primary beneficiaries of the CTC program when benefits
are structured as credits rather than refunds. Third, making program benefits
more generous disproportionally reduces how many single mothers, relative to
married parents and single fathers, can claim this benefit. Fourth and finally,
increasing credit refundability can mitigate gender differences in relief
eligibility, although doing so imposes externalities of its own. Our findings
can inform public policy discourse surrounding the efficacy of programs like
the CTC and the effectiveness of programs aimed at alleviating child poverty.

(ii) modeling its copula distribution. COMET Flows capture heavy-tailed
marginal distributions by combining a parametric tail belief at extreme
quantiles of the marginals with an empirical kernel density function at
mid-quantiles. In addition, COMET Flows capture asymmetric tail dependence
among multivariate extremes by viewing such dependence as inducing a
low-dimensional manifold structure in feature space. Experimental results on

generating adequate trust. Thus, it is seldom utilized as a standalone unit in
IoT high-risk applications, such as critical industrial infrastructures,
medical systems, and financial applications, etc. Explainable AI (XAI) has
emerged to help with this problem. However, designing appropriately fast and
accurate XAI is still challenging, especially in numerical applications. Here,
we propose a universal XAI model named Transparency Relying Upon Statistical
Theory (TRUST), which is model-agnostic, high-performing, and suitable for
numerical applications. Simply put, TRUST XAI models the statistical behavior
of the AI's outputs in an AI-based system. Factor analysis is used to transform
the input features into a new set of latent variables. We use mutual
information to rank these variables and pick only the most influential ones on
the AI's outputs and call them ""representatives"" of the classes. Then we use
multi-modal Gaussian distributions to determine the likelihood of any new
sample belonging to each class. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TRUST in a
case study on cybersecurity of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) using
three different cybersecurity datasets. As IIoT is a prominent application that
deals with numerical data. The results show that TRUST XAI provides
explanations for new random samples with an average success rate of 98%.
Compared with LIME, a popular XAI model, TRUST is shown to be superior in the
context of performance, speed, and the method of explainability. In the end, we
also show how TRUST is explained to the user.

identify objects in images based on a small number of images with pixel-level
labels, and many more images with only image-level labels. Most existing SWSSS
algorithms extract pixel-level pseudo-labels from an image classifier - a very
difficult task to do well, hence requiring complicated architectures and
extensive hyperparameter tuning on fully-supervised validation sets. We propose
a method called prediction filtering, which instead of extracting
pseudo-labels, just uses the classifier as a classifier: it ignores any
segmentation predictions from classes which the classifier is confident are not
present. Adding this simple post-processing method to baselines gives results
competitive with or better than prior SWSSS algorithms. Moreover, it is
compatible with pseudo-label methods: adding prediction filtering to existing
SWSSS algorithms further improves segmentation performance.

latency performance for very large scale data center networks. Network tail
latency is often a crucial metric for cloud application performance that can be
affected by a wide variety of factors, including network load, inter-rack
traffic skew, traffic burstiness, flow size distributions, oversubscription,
and topology asymmetry. Network simulators such as ns-3 and OMNeT++ can provide
accurate answers, but are very hard to parallelize, taking hours or days to
answer what if questions for a single configuration at even moderate scale.
Recent work with MimicNet has shown how to use machine learning to improve
simulation performance, but at a cost of including a long training step per
configuration, and with assumptions about workload and topology uniformity that
typically do not hold in practice.
  We address this gap by developing a set of techniques to provide fast
performance estimates for large scale networks with general traffic matrices
and topologies. A key step is to decompose the problem into a large number of
parallel independent single-link simulations; we carefully combine these
link-level simulations to produce accurate estimates of end-to-end flow level
performance distributions for the entire network. Like MimicNet, we exploit
symmetry where possible to gain additional speedups, but without relying on
machine learning, so there is no training delay. On large-scale networks where
ns-3 takes 11 to 27 hours to simulate five seconds of network behavior, our
techniques run in one to two minutes with 99th percentile accuracy within 9%
for flow completion times.

it affects the capacity of what a network can learn and determines the
complexity of the solution. This latter property is often exploited when
introducing information bottlenecks, forcing a network to learn compressed
representations. However, such an architecture decision is typically immutable
once training begins; switching to a more compressed architecture requires
retraining. In this paper we present a new layer design, called Triangular
Dropout, which does not have this limitation. After training, the layer can be
arbitrarily reduced in width to exchange performance for narrowness. We
demonstrate the construction and potential use cases of such a mechanism in
three areas. Firstly, we describe the formulation of Triangular Dropout in
autoencoders, creating models with selectable compression after training.
Secondly, we add Triangular Dropout to VGG19 on ImageNet, creating a powerful
network which, without retraining, can be significantly reduced in parameters.
Lastly, we explore the application of Triangular Dropout to reinforcement

computation complexity is desirable, which can also result in a minimization of

To this end, the CNN in the proposed system has a unique structure with 2
distinguished characters. Firstly, the three paths of its feature extraction
block are designed to extract, from the multi-modality input, comprehensive
feature information of mono-modality, paired-modality and cross-modality data,
respectively. Also, it has a particular three-branch classification block to
identify the pixels of 4 classes. Each branch is trained separately so that the
parameters are updated specifically with the corresponding ground truth data of
a target tumor areas. The convolution layers of the system are custom-designed
with specific purposes, resulting in a very simple config of 61,843 parameters

reducing dark permissions of cloud users as an optimality criterion, which
intuitively implies minimizing unnecessary datastore access permissions.
Second, to make IAM policies interpretable, we use graph representation
learning applied to historical access patterns of users to augment our CP model
with similarity constraints: similar users should be grouped together and share
common IAM policies. Third, we describe multiple attack models and show that
our optimized IAM policies significantly reduce the impact of security attacks

typed code by providing a principled semantics for imprecise types and proofs,
where some parts have been omitted. Current theories of gradual dependent
types, though, lack a central feature of type theory: propositional equality.
Lennon-Bertrand et al. show that, when the reflexive proof $\mathit{refl}$ is
the only closed value of an equality type, a gradual extension of CIC with
propositional equality violates static observational equivalences.
Extensionally-equal functions should be indistinguishable at run time, but the
combination of equality and type imprecision allows for contexts that
distinguish extensionally-equal but syntactically-different functions.
  This work presents a gradually typed language that supports propositional
equality. We avoid the above issues by devising an equality type where
$\mathit{refl}$ is not the only closed inhabitant. Instead, each equality proof
carries a term that is at least as precise as the equated terms, acting as a
witness of their plausible equality. These witnesses track partial type
information as a program runs, raising errors when that information shows that
two equated terms are undeniably inconsistent. Composition of type information
is internalized as a construct of the language, and is deferred for function
bodies whose evaluation is blocked by variables. By deferring, we ensure that
extensionally equal functions compose without error, thereby preventing
contexts from distinguishing them. We describe the challenges of designing
consistency and precision relations for this system, along with solutions to
these challenges. Finally, we prove important metatheory: type-safety,
conservative embedding of CIC, canonicity, and the gradual guarantees of Siek

platform. The key attribute that makes MXUs so successful is the semiring
structure, which allows tiling for both parallelism and data reuse.
Nonetheless, matrix-multiplication is not the only algorithm with such
attributes. We find that many algorithms share the same structure and differ in
only the core operation; for example, using add-minimum instead of
multiply-add. Algorithms with a semiring-like structure therefore have
potential to be accelerated by a general-purpose matrix operation architecture,
instead of common MXUs.
  In this paper, we propose SIMD$^2$, a new programming paradigm to support
generalized matrix operations with a semiring-like structure. SIMD$^2$
instructions accelerate eight more types of matrix operations, in addition to
matrix multiplications. Since SIMD$^2$ instructions resemble a
matrix-multiplication instruction, we are able to build SIMD$^2$ architecture
on top of any MXU architecture with minimal modifications. We developed a
framework that emulates and validates SIMD$^2$ using NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor
Cores. Across 8 applications, SIMD2 provides up to 38.59$\times$ speedup and
more than 10.63$\times$ on average over optimized CUDA programs, with only 5%
of full-chip area overhead.

citations depending on how much they have been already cited. On the other

phenomenon is known as Sleeping Beauty(SB). Since disrupting discoveries need
long-time discussion by the research community to accept, SBs can capture
innovative findings and reveal the nature of disruptive scientific knowledge
production. To research SBs citation burst mechanism, bibliometricians consider
the existence of the Prince(PR) for each SBs, which can be the trigger of SBs
awakeness. For example, the discovery of Green Fluorescent Protein(GFP), which
got Nobel prize in chemistry, had been overlooked for 30 years until Chalfie
and Tsien, who also received the prize, developed a method to use GFP as a
marker protein in genetic engineering. However, how does Chalfies and Tsiens
research relight the hidden knowledge in the research community? If we can
clarify such a mechanism rediscovering from nearly nothing, it can be helpful
in science support and policy decision-making. This study proposes a
Storyteller that focuses on the connection between SB and PR before SB gets
citation burst by co-citation. PR is found to be the paper awakening SB in
retrospect, but it is not easy to detect it as the trigger of SBs awakeness at
the time of PR submission. We named the papers which co-cites SB and PR before
the citation burst of SB as Storyteller(ST) and analyze (1) how ST contributes
to broadening the novelty of SB&PR connections and (2) how much ST leads the

large proportion of household expenditure. Additionally, the loss of housing
can have catastrophic consequences. These specific features of housing
expenditure imply that housing stress could cause negative mental health
impacts. This research investigates the effects of housing stress on mental
health, contributing to the literature by nesting housing stress within a
measure of financial hardship, thus improving robustness to omitted variables
and creating a natural comparison group for matching. Fixed effects (FE)
regressions and a difference-in-differences (DID) methodology are estimated
utilising data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia
(HILDA) Survey. The results show that renters who are in housing stress have a
significant decline in self-reported mental health, with those in prior
financial hardship being more severely affected. In contrast, there is little
to no evidence of housing stress impacting on owners with a mortgage. The
results also suggest that the mental health impact of housing stress is more
important than some, but not all, aspects of financial hardship.

quantitative information flow as the fundamental principle for studying
universal optimality. Metric differential privacy is a generalisation of both
standard (i.e., central) differential privacy and local differential privacy,
and it is increasingly being used in various application domains, for instance
in location privacy and in privacy preserving machine learning. Using this
framework we are able to clarify Nissim and Brenner's negative results, showing
(a) that in fact all privacy types contain optimal mechanisms relative to
certain kinds of non-trivial loss functions, and (b) extending and generalising
their negative results beyond Bayes risk specifically to a wide class of

nonlinearity and nonsmooth control strategy in the simple and clear formula.
The nonlinear dynamical behaviors of this new model are investigated for both
the autonomous and the non-autonomous cases. The three equations of motion of
the TCG are presented based on Euler-Lagrange equation and the theorem of
angular momentum. The velocity, nonlinear restoring force and nonsmooth torque
surfaces are plotted to display the complex relationship of parameter change
dependence. Secondely, the equilibrium bifurcation and stability analysis for
autonomous system are investigated to show the pitchork bifurcation phenomena
and the saddle-focus point respectively. It is found that the system bears
significant similarities to the Duffing system with mono-stable and bi-stable
characteristic. Finally, the three-dimensional Melnikov method is defined and
employed to obtained the analytical chaotic thresholds for non-autonomous
centrifugal governor system, and numerical results of chaotic behaviors verify
the proposed theoretical criteria of the non-autonomous system. The
experimental studies are carried out to validate the theoretical and numerical
results.

salient features, readers tend to recall those features. Still, we lack
explicit guidelines for how to compose the appropriate caption. Further, what
if the author wishes to emphasize a less salient feature?
  In this paper, we study how the visual salience of the feature described in a

captions that 1) describe either the primary or secondary salient feature in a

  We find that the primary salient feature is more memorable for single-line
charts when the caption is expressed at the statistical level; for primary and
secondary features in multi-line charts, the perceptual level is more
memorable. We also find that many readers will tend to recall y-axis numerical

However, it is difficult to deploy state-of-the-art HRNet-based pose estimation
models on resource-constrained edge devices due to the high computational cost
(more than 150 GMACs per frame). In this paper, we study efficient architecture
design for real-time multi-person pose estimation on edge. We reveal that
HRNet's high-resolution branches are redundant for models at the
low-computation region via our gradual shrinking experiments. Removing them
improves both efficiency and performance. Inspired by this finding, we design
LitePose, an efficient single-branch architecture for pose estimation, and
introduce two simple approaches to enhance the capacity of LitePose, including
Fusion Deconv Head and Large Kernel Convs. Fusion Deconv Head removes the
redundancy in high-resolution branches, allowing scale-aware feature fusion
with low overhead. Large Kernel Convs significantly improve the model's
capacity and receptive field while maintaining a low computational cost. With
only 25% computation increment, 7x7 kernels achieve +14.0 mAP better than 3x3
kernels on the CrowdPose dataset. On mobile platforms, LitePose reduces the
latency by up to 5.0x without sacrificing performance, compared with prior
state-of-the-art efficient pose estimation models, pushing the frontier of
real-time multi-person pose estimation on edge. Our code and pre-trained models

the polarised signal from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from that of the
Milky Way (MW) in order to construct a wide-field, spatially complete map of
dust polarization using the Planck 353 GHz data. To estimate the foreground
polarization direction, we used velocity gradients in HI spectral line data and
assessed the performance of the output by comparing to starlight extinction
polarization. We estimate the foreground intensity using dust properties
derived previously from the Planck data and we assume the foreground
polarization to be uniform and equal to the average of the MW around the
galaxy. After foreground removal, the geometry of the plane-of-the-sky magnetic
field in the LMC tends to follow the structure of the atomic gas in the LMC.
This is notably the case along the molecular ridges extending south and
south-east of the 30 Doradus star-forming complex, and along more diffuse
southern arm extending towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. There is also an
alignment between the magnetic field and the outer arm in the western part. The
median polarization fraction in the LMC is slightly lower than that observed
for the MW while the anti-correlation between the polarization angle dispersion
function and the polarization fraction is slightly larger. Overall,
polarization fraction distribution is similar to that observed in the MW.

estimation methods evaluated using the proposed procedure include: Negative

architecture for DMSE using a multi-head cross-attention based convolutional
recurrent network (MHCA-CRN) is presented. The proposed MHCA-CRN model includes
a channel-wise encoding structure for preserving intra-channel features and a

biomarkers in clinical trials where the number of covariates exceeds the number
of participants often results in high false discovery rates. The higher than
expected number of false positives translates to wasted resources when
conducting follow-up experiments for drug target identification and diagnostic
assay development. Patient outcomes are in turn negatively affected. We propose
a variable importance parameter for directly assessing the importance of
potentially predictive biomarkers, and develop a flexible nonparametric
inference procedure for this estimand. We prove that our estimator is
double-robust and asymptotically linear under loose conditions on the
data-generating process, permitting valid inference about the importance
metric. The statistical guarantees of the method are verified in a thorough

by a user based on their behavioral history. Compared to conventional
sequential models that leverage attention mechanisms and RNNs, recent efforts
mainly follow two directions for improvement: multi-interest learning and graph
convolutional aggregation. Specifically, multi-interest methods such as ComiRec
and MIMN, focus on extracting different interests for a user by performing
historical item clustering, while graph convolution methods including TGSRec
and SURGE elect to refine user preferences based on multi-level correlations
between historical items. Unfortunately, neither of them realizes that these
two types of solutions can mutually complement each other, by aggregating
multi-level user preference to achieve more precise multi-interest extraction
for a better recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose a unified
multi-grained neural model(named MGNM) via a combination of multi-interest
learning and graph convolutional aggregation. Concretely, MGNM first learns the
graph structure and information aggregation paths of the historical items for a
user. It then performs graph convolution to derive item representations in an
iterative fashion, in which the complex preferences at different levels can be
well captured. Afterwards, a novel sequential capsule network is proposed to
inject the sequential patterns into the multi-interest extraction process,
leading to a more precise interest learning in a multi-grained manner.

new non-trivial saddles in the spectral correlators that would potentially give
contributions of the same order as the trivial self-averaging saddles. However
after a careful Lefschetz-thimble analysis we show that these non-trivial

aggregating multiple objectives into one final objective to satisfy user demand
and commercial intent. Cascade architecture, composed of retrieval,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages, is usually adopted to reduce the computational
cost. Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and
calculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs. The
multi-stage ranking strategy causes a new problem - the ranked lists of the
ranking stage and previous stages may be inconsistent. For example, items that
should be ranked at the top of the ranking stage may be ranked at the bottom of
previous stages. In this paper, we focus on the \textbf{ranking consistency}
between the pre-ranking and ranking stages. Specifically, we formally define
the problem of ranking consistency and propose the Ranking Consistency Score
(RCS) metric for evaluation. We demonstrate that ranking consistency has a
direct impact on online performance. Compared with the traditional evaluation
manner that mainly focuses on the individual ranking quality of every
objective, RCS considers the ranking consistency of the fused final objective,
which is more proper for evaluation. Finally, to improve the ranking
consistency, we propose several methods from the perspective of sample
selection and learning algorithms. Experimental results on one of the biggest
industrial E-commerce platforms in China validate the efficacy of the proposed
metrics and methods.

wild. It suffers from performance degradation due to large shift of data
distributions and lack of instance-level annotations in the target domain.
Existing approaches mainly focus on either of these two difficulties, even
though they are closely coupled in cross domain object detection. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel Target-perceived Dual-branch Distillation (TDD)
framework. By integrating detection branches of both source and target domains
in a unified teacher-student learning scheme, it can reduce domain shift and
generate reliable supervision effectively. In particular, we first introduce a
distinct Target Proposal Perceiver between two domains. It can adaptively
enhance source detector to perceive objects in a target image, by leveraging
target proposal contexts from iterative cross-attention. Afterwards, we design
a concise Dual Branch Self Distillation strategy for model training, which can
progressively integrate complementary object knowledge from different domains
via self-distillation in two branches. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a number of widely-used scenarios in cross domain object
detection. The results show that our TDD significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on all the benchmarks. Our code and model will be

based on the quantum interference of photon pairs, obtained from a spontaneous
parametric downconversion (SPDC) source. The promise of QOCT derives from two
quantum-conferred advantages when compared to equivalent classical optical
coherence tomography (OCT) systems: a factor of 2 axial resolution enhancement,
as well as dispersion cancellation. However, the technique is far from being
competitive with current OCT devices due to the long required acquisition
times. Here, we on the one hand demonstrate a quantum optical coherence
microscopy (QOCM) technique that is designed to overcome some of the
limitations of previous QOCT implementations, and on the other hand test it on
representative samples, including glass layers with manufactured transverse
patterns and metal-coated biological specimens. We use a collinear SPDC source,
so that the entire emitted photon pair flux may contribute to the measurements,
together with a multi-mode detection design. We employ a Michelson
interferometer with the sample placed as end-mirror in one of the
interferometer arms, instead of the more typical Hong-Ou-Mandel used in QOCT
implementations. In order to probe biological samples we transition from a
Michelson to a Linnik interferometer by placing a microscope objective in the
sample arm. In our setup, while the idler photon is collected with a multi-mode
fiber, the signal photon is detected by an ICCD camera, leading to full-field
transverse reconstruction through a single axial acquisition sequence.
Interestingly, our setup permits concurrent OCT and QOCT trace acquisition, the
former with greater counts and the latter with the benefit of quantum-conferred
advantages. We hope that our current results will represent a significant step
forward towards the actual applicability of QOCT, e.g. in clinical settings.

determining that GMP can be formulated as a solver for GLD. Based on this
observation, we propose an unrolled message passing module and introduce an
$\ell_p$-based graph regularization to suppress spurious connections between
nodes. Second, we propose a group diversity enhancement module that promotes
the prediction diversity of relationships via rank maximization. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that RU-Net is effective under a variety of settings

popular databases: VG, VRD, and OI. Code is available at

traffic. In this paper, several regression models such as Extra Gradient Boost

of several real-world matching markets such as school choice and

opposite side and that the capacities of the hospitals are fixed. It is known
that increasing the capacity of a single hospital improves the residents' final
allocation. On the other hand, reducing the capacity of a single hospital
deteriorates the residents' allocation. In this work, we study the
computational complexity of finding the optimal variation of hospitals'
capacities that leads to the best outcome for the residents, subject to
stability and a capacity variation constraint. First, we show that the decision
problem of finding the optimal capacity expansion is NP-complete and the
corresponding optimization problem is inapproximable within a certain factor.
This result holds under strict and complete preferences, and even if we
allocate extra capacities to disjoint sets of hospitals. Second, we obtain

through controller area network (CAN) buses for critical vehicular control.
However, with the expansion of advanced connectivity features in automobiles
and the elevated risks of internal system exposure, the CAN bus is increasingly
prone to intrusions and injection attacks. The ordinary injection attacks
disrupt the typical timing properties of the CAN data stream, and the
rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) can easily detect them. However,
advanced attackers can inject false data to the time series sensory data
(signal), while looking innocuous by the pattern/frequency of the CAN messages.
Such attacks can bypass the rule-based IDS or any anomaly-based IDS built on
binary payload data. To make the vehicles robust against such intelligent
attacks, we propose CANShield, a signal-based intrusion detection framework for
the CAN bus. CANShield consists of three modules: a data preprocessing module
that handles the high-dimensional CAN data stream at the signal level and makes
them suitable for a deep learning model; a data analyzer module consisting of
multiple deep autoencoder (AE) networks, each analyzing the time-series data
from a different temporal perspective; and finally an attack detection module
that uses an ensemble method to make the final decision. Evaluation results on
two high-fidelity signal-based CAN attack datasets show the high accuracy and
responsiveness of CANShield in detecting wide-range of advanced intrusion
attacks.

The hallucinator is trained by playing an adversarial game with the

real ones in the fine-tuning dataset. By training with the extended dataset,
the language learner effectively learns from the diverse hallucinated
embeddings to overcome the over-fitting issue. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method is effective in a wide range of language tasks, outperforming
current fine-tuning methods. Further, we show that EmbedHalluc outperforms

conserving and non-conserving situations. We employ an analytic approximation
approach for the parity conserving case to reveal the statistical behaviors of
photons and phonons. It indicates that both photons and phonons show strong
antibunching at the same frequency. Even though the bunching properties of
photons/phonons occupy the dominant regions of the considered frequencies,
phonons tend to weakly antibunching within the photonic strong-bunching area.
In contrast, one can find that the configurations of correlation functions for
both photons and phonons in the parity conserving case are squeezed towards the
central frequency by parity breaking, which directly triggers the reverse
statistical behaviors for the different parties at the low-frequency regions
and the strong bunching properties at other frequency regions. The
photon-phonon cross-correlation function also demonstrates similar
parity-induced differences, indicating that the non-conserving parity induces
the photon-phonon bunching behavior. We finally analyze the delayed
second-order correlation function with different driving frequencies, which
illustrates striking oscillations revealing the occurrence of simultaneous

of PSO based algorithms with massive threads on GPUs (graphic processing

analyzed to find the best solution. In particular, the reduction-based method
is considered as a common approach to handle the data aggregation and analysis

the reduction-based method would suffer from excessive memory accesses and
thread synchronization overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm

asynchronously and updating to the global, lock-protected variables

statistical analysis of the data are explicitly modeled as a mixture of their
underlying distributions; thus, unlike methodology currently in use, there is
no subjective thresholding required in the estimation process. The parameters
governing the mixture model are easily obtained by the principle of maximum
likelihood. Further, the estimates can also be used to optimally identify
voxel-specific activation regions along with their corresponding certainty

module that efficiently explores the connections between relationships by
considering heterophily in order to refine the relationship representation; 3)
a heterophily-aware message-passing scheme to further distinguish the
heterophily and homophily between objects/relationships, thereby facilitating
improved message passing in graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on two

Furthermore, some respondents might prefer answering questions using their

propagate approximated gradients without enumerating over the space of possible

spread due to external factors like migration, mobility, etc. is called the
exogenous spread. In this paper, we introduce the Exo-SIR model, an extension

problem. This paper presents the first efficient quantum algorithm for
computing matrix permanents. We transformed the well-known Ryser's formula into
a single quantum overlap integral and a polynomial sum of quantum overlap
integrals to estimate a matrix permanent with the multiplicative error and
additive error protocols, respectively. We show that the multiplicative error
estimation of a matrix permanent would be possible for a special set of
matrices. Such a quantum algorithm would imply that quantum computers can be
more powerful than we expected. Depending on the size of a matrix norm and the
ratio between 2-norm and 1-norm, we can obtain an exponentially small additive
error estimation and better estimation against Gurvits' classical sampling
algorithm with our quantum protocol. Our quantum algorithm attains the
milestone of opening a new direction in quantum computing and computational
complexity theory. It might resolve crucial computational complexity issues
like locating the bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) relative to the
polynomial hierarchy, which has been a big complexity question. Moreover, our
quantum algorithm directly shows the computational complexity connection
between the matrix permanent and the real-time partition function of the
quantum Ising Hamiltonian.

Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) based on the point-coupling
density functionals to odd-$A$ and odd-odd nuclei and examine its applicability
by taking odd-$A$ Nd isotopes as examples. In the DRHBc theory, the densities
and potentials with axial deformation are expanded in terms of Legendre
polynomials, and the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov equations are solved in a
Dirac Woods-Saxon basis to include the continuum effects. For an odd-$A$ or
odd-odd nucleus, the blocking effect of unpaired nucleon(s) is taken into
account with the equal filling approximation. To determine its ground state, an
automatic blocking procedure is adopted, in which the orbital with the lowest
quasiparticle energy is blocked during the iteration. This procedure is
justified by comparing with the results from the orbital-fixed blocking
calculations, in which the blocked orbital near the Fermi surface is fixed
during the iteration. The ground states for both light and heavy nuclei can be
provided by the automatic blocking procedure as the orbital-fixed blocking
procedure, but with considerably reduced computational cost. The numerical
details for even-even nuclei are found to be valid for odd-$A$ and odd-odd
nuclei as well. Taking Nd isotopes including both even-even and odd-$A$ ones as
examples, the calculated ground-state properties with PC-PK1 are in good
agreement with the available experimental data. This work paves the way to
construct the DRHBc mass table including all even-even, odd-$A$ and odd-odd

relevant information for describing the design solution and/or supporting

we propose a model-based approach that was conceived to handle annotations in a

are identified by comparing with the most recent relativistic calculation
utilizing the FAC code. The first resonance at about 86 meV due to the

recognized. The experimental determination of the resonance position at 86 meV
reaches an uncertainty of 4 meV, which allows precise determination of the

apparently unified into the $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ representations. A straightforward
explanation of this fact is to embed all the SM gauge groups into a simple
group containing $\mathrm{SU}(5)$, i.e., the grand unified theory (GUT).
Recently, however, a new framework ""fake GUT"" has been proposed. In this new
framework, the apparent matter unification can be explained by a chiral gauge
group $G$, $ G \supset \mathrm{SU}(5)$. We emphasize that the SM matter fields
are not necessarily embedded into the chiral representations to explain the
apparent unification. In this paper, we discuss details of concrete
realizations of the fake GUT model. We first study the model based on
$\mathrm{SU}(5) \times \mathrm{U}(2)_H$, where $\mathrm{SU}(3)_c$ in the SM is
from $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ while $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L\times \mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ are from
the diagonal subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(5) \times \mathrm{U}(2)_H$. We also
extend this model to the one based on a semi-simple group, $\mathrm{SU}(5)
\times \mathrm{SU}(3)_H$, so that $\mathrm{U}(2)_H$ is embedded in
$\mathrm{SU}(3)_H$. We also show that this framework predicts rather different
decay patterns of the proton, compared to the conventional GUT.

algorithmic information theory, it is possible to estimate the absolute

this theory to neurophysiological recordings can discriminate between different
brain states, they are limited in directly quantifying the degree of similarity

varying bottom friction parameter is tuned to minimize the misfit with respect
to tide gauge sea surface height (SSH) observations. A key benefit of
adjoint-based optimization is that computational cost does not depend on the
number of unknown variables. Adjoint models are, however, typically very
laborious to implement. In this work, we leverage a domain specific language
framework in which the discrete adjoint model can be obtained automatically.
The adjoint model is both exactly compatible with the discrete forward model
and computationally efficient. A gradient-based quasi-Newton method is used to
minimize the misfit. Optimizing spatially-variable parameters is typically an
under-determined problem and can lead to over-fitting. We employ Hessian-based
regularization to penalize the spatial curvature of the friction field to
overcome this problem. The SSH dynamics in the North Sea and Baltic Sea are
simulated for a 3-month period. Optimization of the bottom friction parameter
results in significant improvement of the model performance. The results are
especially encouraging in the complex Danish Straits region, highlighting the
benefit of unstructured meshes. Domain specific language frameworks enable
automated model analysis and provide easy access to adjoint modeling. Our
application shows that this capability can be enabled with few efforts, and the

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to transfer value between participants. One
of its advantages is that it allows parallel processing of transactions, as
independent transactions can be added in any order. This property of order
invariance and parallelisability has potential benefits in terms of
scalability. However, since the UTXO Ledger is an append-only data structure,
this advantage is compromised through the presence of conflicting transactions.
We propose an extended UTXO Ledger model that optimistically updates the ledger

of a conflict resolution mechanism, we propose a method to reduce the extended

significantly close to the double layer force of the DLVO theory. Then, in the
case of hydrophilic surface charge groups within the aqueous region, due to the
spatial separation of the membrane substrate from the location of the fixed
charges where the non-local dielectric response of the structured solvent is
sharply localized, the interfacial field energy and the contact charge
densities remain unaffected by the explicit solvent. As a result, the hydration

determining the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles.
Current MPI systems are capable of imaging iron masses over a wide dynamic

further increased using adaptive amplifiers, which prevent signal clipping.
While this applies to a single sample, the dynamic range is severely limited if
several samples with different concentrations or strongly inhomogeneous
particle distributions are considered. One scenario that occurs quite
frequently in pre-clinical applications is that a highly concentrated tracer
bolus in the vascular system ""shadows"" nearby organs with lower effective
tracer concentrations. The root cause of the problem is the ill-posedness of
the MPI imaging operator, which requires regularization for stable
reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a simple two-step algorithm that
increases the dynamic range by a factor of four. Furthermore, the algorithm
enables spatially adaptive regularization, i.e. highly concentrated signals can
be reconstructed with maximum spatial resolution, while low concentrated

been characterized (both in finite and infinite graphs); however, less is known
about half-positional objectives. In particular, no characterization of
half-positionality is known for the central class of omega-regular objectives.
  In this paper, we characterize objectives recognizable by deterministic
B\""uchi automata (a class of omega-regular objectives) that are
half-positional, both over finite and infinite graphs. Our characterization
consists of three natural conditions linked to the language-theoretic notion of
right congruence. Furthermore, this characterization yields a polynomial-time

segmentation. The approach combines an ML-based detection with a geometry-aware
variational-based segmentation using B-splines that are parametrized based on a
geometric model of the cell shape. The detection is done first using YOLOv5. In
a second step, each detected cell is segmented individually. Thus, the
segmentation only needs to be done on a per-cell basis, which makes it amenable
to a variational approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the geometry.
Here, the contour of the segmentation is modelled as closed uniform cubic
B-spline, whose control points are parametrized using the known cell geometry.
Compared to purely ML-based segmentation approaches, which need accurate
segmentation maps as training data that are very laborious to produce, our
method just needs bounding boxes as training data. Still, the proposed method
performs on par with ML-based segmentation approaches usually used in this
context. We study the performance of the proposed method on time-lapse
microscopy data of Corynebacterium glutamicum.

estimating are two of the major focuses of those involved in the financial
securities industry and derivative instruments pricing. This paper presents the
results of employing the intrinsic entropy model as a substitute for estimating
the volatility of stock market indices. Diverging from the widely used
volatility models that take into account only the elements related to the
traded prices, namely the open, high, low, and close prices of a trading day
(OHLC), the intrinsic entropy model takes into account the traded volumes
during the considered time frame as well. We adjust the intraday intrinsic
entropy model that we introduced earlier for exchange-traded securities in
order to connect daily OHLC prices with the ratio of the corresponding daily
volume to the overall volume traded in the considered period. The intrinsic
entropy model conceptualizes this ratio as entropic probability or market
credence assigned to the corresponding price level. The intrinsic entropy is
computed using historical daily data for traded market indices (S&P 500, Dow
30, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ Composite, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng Index). We
compare the results produced by the intrinsic entropy model with the volatility
estimates obtained for the same data sets using widely employed industry
volatility estimators. The intrinsic entropy model proves to consistently
deliver reliable estimates for various time frames while showing peculiarly
high values for the coefficient of variation, with the estimates falling in a
significantly lower interval range compared with those provided by the other
advanced volatility estimators.

neighbouring ions in rare-earth-ion-doped crystals is one of the mechanisms of
relaxation between hyperfine levels. Modeling of this mechanism has so far been
macroscopic, characterized by an average rate describing the relaxation of all
ions. Here however, we present a microscopic model of flip-flop interactions
between individual nuclear spins of dopant ions. Every ion is situated in a
unique local environment in the crystal, where each ion has different distances
and a unique orientation relative to its nearest neighbors, as determined by
the lattice structure. Thus, each ion has a unique flip-flop rate and the
collective relaxation dynamics of all ions in a bulk crystal is a sum of many
exponential decays, giving rise to a distribution of rates rather than a single
average decay rate. We employ this model to calculate flip-flop rates in
Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ and show experimental measurements of population decay
of the ground state hyperfine levels at $\sim$2 K. We also present a new method
to measure rates of individual transitions from hole burning spectra that
requires significantly fewer fitting parameters in theoretical rate equations

magnetic field on the flip-flop rates and observe that the rates slow down by
two orders of magnitude in a field of 5 - 10 mT.

of a target person performing arbitrary desired motion (from a source person).
While the state-of-the-art methods are able to synthesize a video demonstrating
similar broad stroke motion details, they are generally lacking in texture
details. A pertinent manifestation appears as distorted face, feet, and hands,
and such flaws are very sensitively perceived by human observers. Furthermore,
current methods typically employ GANs with a L2 loss to assess the authenticity
of the generated videos, inherently requiring a large amount of training
samples to learn the texture details for adequate video generation. In this
work, we tackle these challenges from three aspects: 1) We disentangle each
video frame into foreground (the person) and background, focusing on generating
the foreground to reduce the underlying dimension of the network output. 2) We
propose a theoretically motivated Gromov-Wasserstein loss that facilitates
learning the mapping from a pose to a foreground image. 3) To enhance texture
details, we encode facial features with geometric guidance and employ local
GANs to refine the face, feet, and hands. Extensive experiments show that our
method is able to generate realistic target person videos, faithfully copying
complex motions from a source person.

recasted as Textual Entailment tasks using verbalizations, with strong
performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings thanks to pre-trained entailment
models. The fact that relations in current RE datasets are easily verbalized
casts doubts on whether entailment would be effective in more complex tasks. In
this work we show that entailment is also effective in Event Argument
Extraction (EAE), reducing the need of manual annotation to 50% and 20% in ACE
and WikiEvents respectively, while achieving the same performance as with full
training. More importantly, we show that recasting EAE as entailment alleviates
the dependency on schemas, which has been a road-block for transferring
annotations between domains. Thanks to the entailment, the multi-source
transfer between ACE and WikiEvents further reduces annotation down to 10% and
5% (respectively) of the full training without transfer. Our analysis shows
that the key to good results is the use of several entailment datasets to
pre-train the entailment model. Similar to previous approaches, our method
requires a small amount of effort for manual verbalization: only less than 15
minutes per event argument type is needed, and comparable results can be
achieved with users with different level of expertise.

learning pipelines. Non-smoothness encodes structural constraints on the
solutions, such as sparsity, group sparsity, low-rank and sharp edges. It is
also the basis for the definition of robust loss functions and scale-free
functionals such as square-root Lasso. Standard approaches to deal with
non-smoothness leverage either proximal splitting or coordinate descent. These
approaches are effective but usually require parameter tuning, preconditioning
or some sort of support pruning. In this work, we advocate and study a
different route, which operates a non-convex but smooth over-parametrization of
the underlying non-smooth optimization problems. This generalizes quadratic
variational forms that are at the heart of the popular Iterative Reweighted
Least Squares (IRLS). Our main theoretical contribution connects gradient
descent on this reformulation to a mirror descent flow with a varying Hessian
metric. This analysis is crucial to derive convergence bounds that are
dimension-free. This explains the efficiency of the method when using small
grid sizes in imaging. Our main algorithmic contribution is to apply the
Variable Projection (VarPro) method which defines a new formulation by
explicitly minimizing over part of the variables. This leads to a better
conditioning of the minimized functional and improves the convergence of simple
but very efficient gradient-based methods, for instance quasi-Newton solvers.
We exemplify the use of this new solver for the resolution of regularized
regression problems for inverse problems and supervised learning, including
total variation prior and non-convex regularizers.

the security or rather to sell it. We further explore the usage of the
intrinsic entropy model for algorithmic trading, in order to demonstrate the

partially-observed discrete-event systems (DES). Particularly, we are
interested in verifying observational properties that are related to the
information-flow of the system. Observational properties considered here
include diagnosability, predictability, detectability and opacity, which have
drawn considerable attentions in the literature. However, in contrast to
existing results, where different verification procedures are developed for
different properties case-by-case, in this work, we provide a unified framework
for verifying all these properties by reducing each of them as an instance of
HyperLTL model checking. Our approach is based on the construction of a Kripke
structure that effectively captures the issue of unobservability as well as the
finite string semantics in partially-observed DES so that HyperLTL model
checking techniques can be suitably applied. Then for each observational
property considered, we explicitly provide the HyperLTL formula to be checked
over the Kripke structure for the purpose of verification. Our approach is
uniform in the sense that all different properties can be verified with the
same model checking engine. Furthermore, our unified framework also brings new
insights for classifying observational properties for partially-observed DES in
terms of their verification complexity.

UDC was created during the period 1896--1904 to support systematic organization

a distinction between two types of UDC data or two provenances: UDC source
data, and UDC codes as they appear in metadata. To serve the purpose of
supplying semantics one has to front--end UDC LD with a service that can parse
and interpret complex UDC strings. While the use of UDC is free the publishing
and distributing of UDC data is protected by a licence. Publishing of UDC both
as LD and as LOD must be provided for within a complex service that would allow
open access as well as access through a paywall barrier for different levels of
licences. The practical task of publishing the UDC as LOD was informed by the
'10Things guidelines'. The process includes conceptual parts and technological
parts. The transition to a new technology is never a purely mechanical act but
is a research endeavour in its own right. The UDC case has shown the importance
of cross-domain, inter-disciplinary collaboration which needs experts well

emission (AME), is now routinely detected in the Milky Way. Although its link
with the rotation of interstellar (carbonaceous) nano-grains seems to be
relatively well established at cloud scales, large-scale observations show a
lack of correlation between the different tracers of nano-carbons and AME,
which has led the community to question the viability of this link. Aims. Using
ancillary data and spinning dust models for nano-carbons and nano-silicates, we
explore the extent to which the AME that come out of the Galactic Plane might
originate with one or another carrier. Methods. In contrast to previous
large-scale studies, our method is not built on comparing the correlations of
the different dust tracers with each other, but rather on comparing the poor
correlations predicted by the models with observed correlations. This is based
on estimates that are as realistic as possible of the gas ionisation state and
grain charge as a function of the local radiation field and gas density.
Results. First, nano-carbon dust can explain all the observations for medium
properties, in agreement with the latest findings about the separation of cold
and warm neutral medium in the diffuse interstellar medium. The dispersion in
the observations can be accounted for with little variations in the dust size
distribution, abundance, or electric dipole moment. Second, regardless of the
properties and abundance of the nano-silicate dust we considered, spinning
nano-silicates are excluded as the sole source of the AME. Third, the best
agreement with the observations is obtained when the emission of spinning
nano-carbons alone is taken into account. However, a marginal participation of
nano-silicates in AME production cannot be excluded as long as their abundance
does not exceed $Y_{\rm Si} \sim 1\%$.

in $Q$ and $Q$ is a semigroup of straight left I-quotients of $S$. We give a
set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a semigroup to be a straight
left I-order. The conditions are in terms of two binary relations,
corresponding to the potential restrictions of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{L}$
from an oversemigroup, and an associated partial order. Our approach relies on
the meet structure of the $\mathcal{L}$ of inverse semigroups. We prove that
every finite left I-order is straight and give an example of a left I-order

properties of a data set. Such a clustering is actually a sequence of

all points are in the same cluster. A hierarchical clustering achieves an
approximation factor of $\alpha$ if the costs of each $k$-clustering in the
hierarchy are at most $\alpha$ times the costs of an optimal $k$-clustering. We
study as cost functions the maximum (discrete) radius of any cluster

an approximation factor of $1$ cannot be achieved. We call the smallest

way for the belief that safe, accessible, and convenient autonomous vehicles
may be realized in the near future. Despite tremendous advances within this
context, fundamental challenges around safety and reliability are limiting
their arrival and comprehensive adoption. Autonomous vehicles are often tasked
with operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. As a result, they often
make use of highly complex components, such as machine learning approaches, to
handle the nuances of sensing, actuation, and control. While these methods are
highly effective, they are notoriously difficult to assure. Moreover, within
uncertain and dynamic environments, design time assurance analyses may not be
sufficient to guarantee safety. Thus, it is critical to monitor the correctness
of these systems at runtime. One approach for providing runtime assurance of
systems with components that may not be amenable to formal analysis is the
simplex architecture, where an unverified component is wrapped with a safety
controller and a switching logic designed to prevent dangerous behavior. In
this paper, we propose using a real-time reachability algorithm for the
implementation of the simplex architecture to assure the safety of a 1/10 scale
open source autonomous vehicle platform known as F1/10. The reachability
algorithm that we leverage (a) provides provable guarantees of safety, and (b)
is used to detect potentially unsafe scenarios. In our approach, the need to
analyze an underlying controller is abstracted away, instead focusing on the
effects of the controller's decisions on the system's future states. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture through a vast set of experiments

science. This raises the question as to its underlying methodology. While much
emphasis has been put on the close link between the process of learning from
data and induction, the falsificationist component of machine learning has
received minor attention. In this paper, we argue that the idea of
falsification is central to the methodology of machine learning. It is commonly
thought that machine learning algorithms infer general prediction rules from
past observations. This is akin to a statistical procedure by which estimates
are obtained from a sample of data. But machine learning algorithms can also be
described as choosing one prediction rule from an entire class of functions. In
particular, the algorithm that determines the weights of an artificial neural
network operates by empirical risk minimization and rejects prediction rules
that lack empirical adequacy. It also exhibits a behavior of implicit
regularization that pushes hypothesis choice toward simpler prediction rules.
We argue that taking both aspects together gives rise to a falsificationist
account of artificial neural networks.

$D^*_{s0}$ calculated in quark models in the framework of heavy meson chiral
perturbation theory (HMCHPT). The inaccuracy in the choice of the argument of
the chiral loop functions in previous works is corrected. Our calculations
consider the full one-loop corrections that appear at leading order in the
chiral expansion of the effective Lagrangian. Unlike previous approaches, ours
leads to satisfactory results in explaining the low mass of the observed scalar
charm states reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG). It is found that the
mass shift of bare $D^*_{s0}$ ($D^*_{0}$) state is mainly due to the $DK$
($D\pi$) loop corrections for values of the couplings that are compatible with
the measured ones. We show why previous approaches of using HMCHPT in studying
mass shift effects due to chiral loops gave unsatisfactory results.

Although the
fundamental underlying Navier-Stokes equations have been known for two
centuries, it remains extremely challenging to extract from them the
statistical properties of turbulence. Therefore, for practical purpose, a
sustained effort has been devoted to obtaining some effective description of
turbulence, that we may call turbulence modelling, or statistical theory of
turbulence. In this respect, the Renormalisation Group (RG) appears as a tool
of choice, since it is precisely designed to provide effective theories from
fundamental equations by performing in a systematic way the average over
fluctuations. However, for Navier-Stokes turbulence, a suitable framework for
the RG, allowing in particular for non-perturbative approximations, have been
missing, which has thwarted for long RG applications. This framework is
provided by the modern formulation of the RG called functional renormalisation
group. The use of the FRG has rooted important progress in the theoretical
understanding of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The major one is the
rigorous derivation, from the Navier-Stokes equations, of an analytical
expression for any Eulerian multi-point multi-time correlation function, which
is exact in the limit of large wavenumbers. We propose in this {\it JFM
Perspectives} a survey of the FRG method for turbulence. We provide a basic
introduction to the FRG and emphasise how the field-theoretical framework
allows one to systematically and profoundly exploit the symmetries. We then
show that the FRG enables one to describe turbulence forced at large scale,
which was not accessible by perturbative means. We expound the derivation of
the spatio-temporal behaviour of $n$-point correlation functions, and largely
illustrate these results through the analysis of data from experiments and
direct numerical simulations.

the transition dynamics of the environment; this can be leveraged to train an
agent using a hallucinogenic environment such as World Model (WM), thereby
increasing sample efficiency compared to model-free approaches. WM uses
variational auto-encoders and it builds a model of the system and allows
exploring the model in an inexpensive way.
  In RLFlow, we propose a design for a model-based agent with WM which learns
to optimise the architecture of neural networks by performing a sequence of
sub-graph transformations to reduce model runtime. We show that our approach

that bringing charged particles in close contact requires the charges to be

initiation of the aggregation process which allows to control the aggregation

us to arrest the aggregation process after a reaction time by formation of
overcharged cationic aggregates. We obtained within seconds stable dispersions

single-index model. We consider two scalings of the first step learning rate
$\eta$. For small $\eta$, we establish a Gaussian equivalence property for the
trained feature map, and prove that the learned kernel improves upon the
initial random features model, but cannot defeat the best linear model on the
input. Whereas for sufficiently large $\eta$, we prove that for certain $f^*$,
the same ridge estimator on trained features can go beyond this ""linear regime""
and outperform a wide range of random features and rotationally invariant
kernels. Our results demonstrate that even one gradient step can lead to a
considerable advantage over random features, and highlight the role of learning
rate scaling in the initial phase of training.

paradigms to tackle contemporary software demands and provide capabilities for
rapid and reliable software development. Industrial reports show that they are
quickly adopted together in massive software companies. However, because of the
technical and organizational requirements, many difficulties against efficient
implementation of the both emerge in real software teams. Objectives: This
study aims to discover the organization, benefits and issues of software teams
using DevOps & microservices from an immersive perspective. Method: An
ethnographic study was carried out in three companies with different business,
size, products, customers, and degree of globalization. All the three companies
claimed their adoption of DevOps and microservices. Seven months (cumulative)
of participant observations and nine interviews with practitioners were
conducted to collect the data of software teams related to DevOps and
microservices. A cross-company empirical investigation using grounded theory
was done by analyzing the archive data. Results: The adoption of DevOps and
microservices brings benefits to rapid delivery, ability improvements and
burden reduction, whilst the high cost and lack of practical guidance were
emerged. Moreover, our observations and interviews reflect that in software
teams, the relationship between DevOps and microservices is not significant,
which differs from the relationship described in the previous studies. Four
lessons for practitioners and four implications for researchers were discussed
based on our findings. Conclusion: Our findings contribute to the understanding
of the organization, benefits and issues of adopting DevOps and microservices

commonly leads to collectively worst-case outcomes, such as defect-defect in
the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD). To overcome this, some methods, such as
Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), shape their opponents'
learning process. However, these methods are myopic since only a small number
of steps can be anticipated, are asymmetric since they treat other agents as
naive learners, and require the use of higher-order derivatives, which are
calculated through white-box access to an opponent's differentiable learning
algorithm. To address these issues, we propose Model-Free Opponent Shaping
(M-FOS). M-FOS learns in a meta-game in which each meta-step is an episode of
the underlying inner game. The meta-state consists of the inner policies, and
the meta-policy produces a new inner policy to be used in the next episode.
M-FOS then uses generic model-free optimisation methods to learn meta-policies
that accomplish long-horizon opponent shaping. Empirically, M-FOS
near-optimally exploits naive learners and other, more sophisticated algorithms
from the literature. For example, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first
method to learn the well-known Zero-Determinant (ZD) extortion strategy in the
IPD. In the same settings, M-FOS leads to socially optimal outcomes under
meta-self-play. Finally, we show that M-FOS can be scaled to high-dimensional
settings.

Raman spectra of bulk single crystals and X-ray diffraction experiments are

follows: Each key is viewed as $c$ characters from some alphabet $\Sigma$, we
have $c$ fully random hash functions $h_0, \ldots, h_{c - 1} \colon \Sigma \to
\{0, \ldots, 2^l - 1\}$, and a key $x = (x_0, \ldots, x_{c - 1})$ is hashed to
$h(x) = h_0(x_0) \oplus \ldots \oplus h_{c - 1}(x_{c - 1})$ where $\oplus$ is
the bitwise XOR operation. The previous results on tabulation hashing by P{\v
a}tra{\c s}cu and Thorup~[J.ACM'11] and by Aamand et al.~[STOC'20] focused on
proving Chernoff-style tail bounds on hash-based sums, e.g., the number keys
hashing to a given value, for simple tabulation hashing, but their bounds do
not cover the entire tail.
  Chaoses are random variables of the form $\sum a_{i_0, \ldots, i_{c - 1}}
X_{i_0} \cdot \ldots \cdot X_{i_{c - 1}}$ where $X_i$ are independent random
variables. Chaoses are a well-studied concept from probability theory, and
tight analysis has been proven in several instances, e.g., when the independent
random variables are standard Gaussian variables and when the independent
random variables have logarithmically convex tails. We notice that hash-based
sums of simple tabulation hashing can be seen as a sum of chaoses that are not
independent. This motivates us to use techniques from the theory of chaoses to
analyze hash-based sums of simple tabulation hashing.
  In this paper, we obtain bounds for all the moments of hash-based sums for
simple tabulation hashing which are tight up to constants depending only on
$c$. In contrast with the previous attempts, our approach will mostly be
analytical and does not employ intricate combinatorial arguments. The improved
analysis of simple tabulation hashing allows us to obtain bounds for the
moments of hash-based sums for the mixed tabulation hashing introduced by
Dahlgaard et al.~[FOCS'15].

the young disc's DF would be strongly constrained by Gaia data if the
distribution of Galactic dust were accurately known. The DF that best fits the
real data accurately predicts the kinematics of stars at their observed
locations, but it predicts the spatial distribution of stars poorly, almost
certainly on account of errors in the best-available dust map. We argue that
dust models could be greatly improved by modifying the dust model until the
spatial distribution of stars predicted by a DF agreed with the data. The
surface density of OB stars is predicted to peak at $R\simeq5.5\mbox{kpc}$,
slightly outside the reported peak in the surface density of molecular gas; we
suggest that the latter radius may have been under-estimated through the use of
poor kinematic distances. The velocity distributions predicted by the best-fit
DF for stars with measured line-of-sight velocities $v_\parallel$ reveal that
the outer disc is disturbed at the level of 10 $\mbox{km}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$ in

have significant contributions from the orbital velocities of binaries. Hence
the outer disc is colder than it is sometimes reported to be.

node-to-word alignments. These alignments are learned separately from parser
training and require a complex pipeline of rule-based components,
pre-processing, and post-processing to satisfy domain-specific constraints.
Parsers also train on a point-estimate of the alignment pipeline, neglecting
the uncertainty due to the inherent ambiguity of alignment. In this work we
explore two avenues for overcoming these limitations. First, we propose a
neural aligner for AMR that learns node-to-word alignments without relying on
complex pipelines. We subsequently explore a tighter integration of aligner and
parser training by considering a distribution over oracle action sequences
arising from aligner uncertainty. Empirical results show this approach leads to
more accurate alignments and generalization better from the AMR2.0 to AMR3.0

enable humans to rely on AI advice appropriately and thereby reach CTP.
However, CTP is rarely demonstrated in previous work as often the focus is on
the design of explainability, while a fundamental prerequisite -- the presence

Therefore, we focus on the existence of this potential for effective human-AI
decision-making. Specifically, we identify information asymmetry as an
essential source of complementarity potential, as in many real-world

conducting an online experiment, we demonstrate that humans can use such
contextual information to adjust the AI's decision, finally resulting in CTP.

Waal (vdW) materials is a prerequisite for their high-end applications in
integrated electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics. Currently,
centimetre- to even metre-scale monolayers of single-crystal graphene (MLG) and
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have been achieved by epitaxial growth on
various single-crystalline substrates. However, in principle, this success in
monolayer epitaxy seems extremely difficult to be replicated to bi- or
few-layer growth, as the full coverage of the first layer was believed to
terminate the reactivity of those adopting catalytic metal surfaces. Here, we
report an exceptional layer-by-layer chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth of
large size bi-layer graphene single-crystals, enabled by self-transmitting
catalytic activity from platinum (Pt) surfaces to the outermost graphene
layers. In-situ growth and real-time surveillance experiments, under
well-controlled environments, unambiguously verify that the growth does follow
the layer-by-layer mode on open surfaces of MLG/Pt(111). First-principles
calculations indicate that the transmittal of catalytic activity is allowed by
an appreciable electronic hybridisation between graphene overlayers and Pt
surfaces, enabling catalytic dissociation of hydrocarbons and subsequently
direct graphitisation of their radicals on the outermost sp2 carbon surface.
This self-transmitting catalytic activity is also proven to be robust for
tube-furnace CVD in fabricating single-crystalline graphene bi-, tri- and
tetra-layers, as well as h-BN few-layers. Our findings offer an exceptional
strategy for potential controllable, layer-by-layer and wafer-scale growth of
vertically stacked few-layered 2D single crystals.

strong baselines in predicting key indicators such as population, purchasing

the trained features from one country can generalize to other countries when

rheology has received relatively little attention. Here we exploit a novel,
particle-resolved, experimental set-up and complementary computer simulations
to measure the shear rheology of quasi-hard-disc colloids in extreme
confinement. In particular, we confine quasi-2d hard discs in a circular
`corral' comprised of 27 particles held in optical traps. Confinement and shear
suppress hexagonal ordering that would occur in the bulk and create a layered
fluid. We measure the rheology of our system by balancing drag and driving
forces on each layer. Given the extreme confinement, it is remarkable that our
system exhibits rheological behavior very similar to unconfined 2d and 3d hard
particle systems, characterized by a dynamic yield stress and shear-thinning of
comparable magnitude. By quantifying particle motion perpendicular to shear, we
show that particles become more tightly confined to their layers with no
concomitant increase in density upon increasing shear rate. Shear thinning is
therefore a consequence of a reduction in dissipation due to a weakening in
interactions between layers as the shear rate increases. We reproduce our
experiments with Brownian Dynamics simulations with Hydrodynamic Interactions
(HI) included at the level of the Rotne-Prager tensor. That the inclusion of HI
is necessary to reproduce our experiments is evidence of their importance in
transmission of momentum through the system.

for multilayer networks with inter-layer constraints on node importance.
Specifically, we consider a multilayer network defined by multiple
edge-weighted, potentially directed, graphs over the same set of nodes with
each graph representing one layer of the network and no inter-layer edges. As
in the standard eigenvector centrality construction, the importance of each
node in a given layer is based on the weighted sum of the importance of
adjacent nodes in that same layer. Unlike standard eigenvector centrality, we
assume that the adjacency relationship and the importance of adjacent nodes may
be based on distinct layers. Importantly, this type of centrality constraint is
only partially supported by existing frameworks for multilayer eigenvector
centrality that use edges between nodes in different layers to capture
inter-layer dependencies. For our model, constrained, layer-specific
eigenvector centrality values are defined by a system of independent eigenvalue

in the new era. However, traffic data's complex spatial and temporal
dependencies make traffic forecasting extremely challenging. Most existing
traffic forecasting methods rely on the predefined adjacency matrix to model
the Spatio-temporal dependencies. Nevertheless, the road traffic state is
highly real-time, so the adjacency matrix should change dynamically with time.
This article presents a new Multi-Spatio-temporal Fusion Graph Recurrent
Network (MSTFGRN) to address the issues above. The network proposes a
data-driven weighted adjacency matrix generation method to compensate for
real-time spatial dependencies not reflected by the predefined adjacency
matrix. It also efficiently learns hidden Spatio-temporal dependencies by
performing a new two-way Spatio-temporal fusion operation on parallel
Spatio-temporal relations at different moments. Finally, global Spatio-temporal
dependencies are captured simultaneously by integrating a global attention
mechanism into the Spatio-temporal fusion module. Extensive trials on four
large-scale, real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to alternative baselines.

science and engineering is the so-called space-time finite-element method that
utilized finiteelements in both space and time. A common ansatz in this context
is to divide the mesh in temporal direction into so-called space-time slabs,
which are subsequently weakly connected in time with a Discontinuous Galerkin
approach. The corresponding jumpterm, which is responsible for imposing the
weak continuity across space-time slabs can be challenging to compute, in
particular in the context of deforming domains. Ensuring a conforming
discretization of the space-time slab at the top and bottom in time direction
simplifies the handling of this term immensely. Otherwise, a computationally
expensive and error prone projection of the solution from one time-level to
another is necessary. However, when it comes to simulations with deformable
domains, e.g. for free-surface flows, ensuring conforming meshes is quite
laborious. A possible solution to this challenge is to extrude a spatial mesh
in time at each time-step resulting in the so-called time-discontinuous
prismatic space-time (D-PST) method. However, this procedure is restricted to
finite-elements of 1st order in time. We present a novel algorithmic approach
for arbitrarily discretized meshes by flipping the mesh in time-direction for
each time-step. This ansatz allows for a simple evaluation of the jump-term as
the mesh is always conforming. The cost of flipping the mesh around its
symmetry plane in time scales with the number of nodes, which makes it
computationally cheaper than an additional update of the mesh to enforce
conformity or the evaluation of a projection. We validate the approach on
various physical problems with and without deforming domains.

Understanding current algorithms is essential to find suitable methods or

introduce the challenges in computer vision tasks and vicinity distribution.
Then, the algorithms are split into three categories; model-free, model-based,
and optimizing policy-based. The model-free category employs image processing
methods while the model-based method leverages trainable image generation
models. In contrast, the optimizing policy-based approach aims to find the
optimal operations or their combinations. Furthermore, we discuss the current
trend of common applications with two more active topics, leveraging different
ways to understand image augmentation, such as group and kernel theory, and
deploying image augmentation for unsupervised learning. Based on the analysis,
we believe that our survey gives a better understanding helpful to choose

approximately by half and shortens the decoding delay significantly. Our

simulations with regular LDPC codes confirm that the uniformly quantized

without revealing any information about $\mathbf{A}$ and the index of target

space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA, have the potential to improve
our understanding of neutron star physics and binary evolution. In this work we
assess the effect of changing the model of the Milky Way's kinematics and star
formation history on predictions of the population of double neutron stars that
will be detected and resolved by LISA. We conclude that the spatial
distribution of these binaries is insensitive to the choice of galactic models,
compared to the stochastic variation induced by the small sample size. In
particular, the time-consuming computation of the binaries' Galactic orbits is
not necessary. The distributions of eccentricity and gravitational-wave
frequency are, however, affected by the choice of star-formation history.
Binaries with eccentricities e>0.1, which can be measured by LISA observations,
are mostly younger than 100 Myr. We caution that comparisons between different
predictions for LISA observations need to use consistent star formation
histories, and that the Galactic star formation history should be taken into
account in the analysis of the observations themselves. The lack of strong
dependency on Galactic models means that LISA detection of double neutron star
binaries may provide a relatively clean probe of massive binary star evolution.

  Firstly, we prove a lower bound on the list-size required for random linear

error radius $\rho$ and input lists of size $\ell$. We show that the list-size
$L$ must be at least $\frac{\log_q\binom{q}{\ell}-R}{\varepsilon}$, where $R$
is the rate of the random linear code. As a comparison, we also pin down the
list size of random codes which is $\frac{\log_q\binom{q}{\ell}}{\varepsilon}$.
This leaves open the possibility (that we consider likely) that random linear
codes perform better than random codes for list-recoverability, which is in
contrast to a recent gap shown for the case of list-recovery from erasures
(Guruswami et al., IEEE TIT 2021B).
  Next, we consider list-decoding with constant list-sizes. Specifically, we
obtain new lower bounds on the rate required for list-of-$3$ decodability of
random linear codes over $\mathbb F_2$; and list-of-$2$ decodability of random
linear codes over $\mathbb F_q$ (for any $q$). This expands upon Guruswami et
al. (IEEE TIT 2021A) which only studied list-of-$2$ decodability of random

credit card dataset we show that, even when Machine Learning techniques perform
only slightly better than Logistic Regression in classifying individual
defaults as a function of the covariates, they do outperform it at the
portfolio level. This happens because they capture linear and non-linear
dependence among the covariates, whereas Logistic Regression only captures
linear dependence. The ability of Machine Learning methods to capture
non-linear dependence among the covariates produces higher default correlation
compared with Logistic Regression. As a consequence, on our data, Logistic
Regression underestimates the riskiness of the credit portfolio.

considerable reduction of wind velocity for downstream wind turbines, resulting
in a significant amount of power loss. Therefore, it is very crucial to predict
wind turbine wakes efficiently. Thus, we propose a large-eddy simulation (LES)
methodology, which takes the vorticity stretching to model transients in wind
turbine wakes. In addition, we present an improved actuator disk model, which
accounts for two-way feedback between the atmosphere and the wakes. First, we
show that the vertical profile of the mean wind predicted with the new model
has an excellent agreement with experimental measurements. Next, we validate
the predicted Reynolds stresses against wind tunnel data and show that the
dispersive stresses account for about 40% of Reynolds stresses. Finally, we
show that the proposed LES method accurately predicts the characteristics of
wind turbine wakes. Comparing the LES results with previously reported data, we
have found that the new LES framework accurately predicts the flow statistics
in both the near-wake and the far-wake regions.

adaptive attention mechanism to derive the target prompts. For each data

coordinates. Some of these can remove effects that are invariant under the
standard gauge transformations and also affect asymptotic boundary conditions,
thus introducing a non-trivial ambiguity in our cosmological modeling. In this
short note we point out that this ambiguity is irrelevant for the quantities we
use to compare our model with observations -- the cosmological observable
relations -- as they are invariant under all of these transformations.
Importantly, this invariance holds only if one takes into account all the
relativistic contributions to an observable, which is not the case in the
literature in general. We finally also show that the practically-relevant
property of conformal Fermi coordinates (a FLRW metric up to second order in
distance) can be achieved through a globally-defined standard gauge
transformation.

strategy, in which the model is first trained at the sentence level and then
finetuned for document-level translation. We conduct experiments on three

atomic system allows the identification of bright, dark, and spectator states
associated with different configurations of atomic states and microwave
polarisation. We derived synthetic spectra that show the main features of
Rydberg spectroscopy. Complex Autler-Townes spectra are obtained in a regime of
strong microwave dressing, where a hybridisation of the Rydberg fine structure
states is produced by the driving.

parameters. Adapters provide a parameter-efficient alternative for the full
finetuning in which we can only finetune lightweight neural network layers on
top of pretrained weights. Adapter layers are initialized randomly. However,
existing work uses the same adapter architecture -- i.e., the same adapter
layer on top of each layer of the pretrained model -- for every dataset,
regardless of the properties of the dataset or the amount of available training
data. In this work, we introduce adaptable adapters that contain (1) learning
different activation functions for different layers and different input data,
and (2) a learnable switch to select and only use the beneficial adapter
layers. We show that adaptable adapters achieve on-par performances with the
standard adapter architecture while using a considerably smaller number of
adapter layers. In addition, we show that the selected adapter architecture by
adaptable adapters transfers well across different data settings and similar
tasks. We propose to use adaptable adapters for designing efficient and
effective adapter architectures. The resulting adapters (a) contain about 50%
of the learning parameters of the standard adapter and are therefore more
efficient at training and inference, and require less storage space, and (b)
achieve considerably higher performances in low-data settings.

multi-cameras to extend the field-of-view of a single camera, capturing more
people in the scene, and improve counting performance for occluded people or
those in low resolution. However, the current multi-view paradigm trains and
tests on the same single scene and camera-views, which limits its practical
application. In this paper, we propose a cross-view cross-scene (CVCS)
multi-view crowd counting paradigm, where the training and testing occur on
different scenes with arbitrary camera layouts. To dynamically handle the
challenge of optimal view fusion under scene and camera layout change and
non-correspondence noise due to camera calibration errors or erroneous
features, we propose a CVCS model that attentively selects and fuses multiple
views together using camera layout geometry, and a noise view regularization
method to train the model to handle non-correspondence errors. We also generate
a large synthetic multi-camera crowd counting dataset with a large number of
scenes and camera views to capture many possible variations, which avoids the
difficulty of collecting and annotating such a large real dataset. We then test
our trained CVCS model on real multi-view counting datasets, by using
unsupervised domain transfer. The proposed CVCS model trained on synthetic data
outperforms the same model trained only on real data, and achieves promising
performance compared to fully supervised methods that train and test on the

subsampling, we analyze the corresponding privacy amplification via non-uniform
subsampling. We show that when the size of the local datasets is small, the
privacy guarantees via random participation is close to those of the

trace the chemical evolution of the disc. Despite of the huge observational and
theoretical effort, discrepancies between models and data are still present and
several explanations have been put forward to explain the [$\alpha$/Fe]
bimodality. Aims. In this work, we take advantage of a new AMBRE:HARPS dataset,
which provides new and more precise [Mg/Fe] estimations, as well as reliable
stellar ages for a subsample of stars, to study the evolution of the solar
neighbourhood. Methods. The above data are compared with detailed chemical
evolution models for the Milky Way, exploring the most used prescriptions for
stellar yields and different formation scenarios for the Galactic disc, i.e.
the delayed two-infall and the parallel model, also including prescriptions for
stellar radial migration. Results. We see that most of the stellar yields
struggle to reproduce the observed trend of the data and that semi-empirical
yields are still the best to describe the [Mg/Fe] evolution in the thick and
thin discs. In particular, most of the yields still predict a steeper decrease
of the [Mg/Fe] ratio at high metallicity than what is shown by the data. The
bulk of the data are well reproduced by the parallel and two-infall scenarios,
but both scenarios have problems in explaining the most metal-rich and
metal-poor tails of the low-$\alpha$ data. These tails can be explained in
light of radial migration from inner and outer disc regions, respectively.
Conclusions. Despite of the evidence of stellar migration, it is difficult to
estimate the actual contribution of stars from other parts of the disc to the
solar vicinity. However, the comparison between data and models suggests that
peculiar histories of star formation, such as that of the two-infall model, are
still needed to reproduce the observed distribution of stars.

energies to meet the ever-stringent climate target. Hydrogen, as an energy
carrier, will play a key role in building a climate-neutral society. Although
liquid hydrogen is essential for hydrogen storage and transportation,
liquefying hydrogen is costly with the conventional methods based on
Joule-Thomas effect. As an emerging technology which is potentially more
efficient, magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction is a ""game-changer"". In this
work, we have investigated the rare-earth-based Laves phases ${\rm R}Al_2$ and
${\rm R}Ni_2$ for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. We have noticed an
unaddressed feature that the magnetocaloric effect of second-order
magnetocaloric materials can become ""giant"" near the hydrogen boiling point.
This feature indicates strong correlations, down to the boiling point of
hydrogen, among the three important quantities of the magnetocaloric effect:
the maximum magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$, the maximum adiabatic
temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$, and the Curie temperature $T_C$. Via
a comprehensive literature review, we interpret the correlations for a
rare-earth intermetallic series as two trends: (1) $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$
increases with decreasing $T_C$; (2) $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$ decreases near room
temperature with decreasing $T_C$ but increases at cryogenic temperatures.
Moreover, we have developed a mean-field approach to describe these two trends
theoretically. The dependence of $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$ and $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$
on $T_C$ revealed in this work helps us quickly anticipate the magnetocaloric
performance of rare-earth-based compounds, guiding material design and

eco-driving of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) with the goal of improving its
grid-to-meter energy efficiency. Thus, an optimisation problem is formulated,
aiming at finding the optimal trade-off between trip time and charging cost.
The formulated problem is then transformed into a hybrid dynamical system,
where the dynamics in driving and charging modes are modeled with different
functions and with different state and control vectors. Moreover, to improve
computational efficiency, we propose modelling the driving dynamics in a
spatial domain, where decisions are made along the traveled distance. Charging
dynamics are modeled in a temporal domain, where decisions are made along a
normalized charging time. The actual charging time is modeled as a scalar
variable that is optimized simultaneously with the optimal state and control
trajectories, for both charging and driving modes. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is assessed over a road with a hilly terrain, where two
charging possibilities are considered along the driving route. According to the
results, trip time including driving and charging times, is reduced by 44 %,
compared to a case without battery active heating/cooling.

previous fastest algorithm for this problem is based on interior point methods

  To break this barrier, we develop a new implicit representation for flows
based on generalized nested-dissection [Lipton-Rose-Tarjan, JSTOR'79] and
approximate Schur complements [Kyng-Sachdeva, FOCS'16]. This implicit
representation permits us to design a data structure to route an electrical

total running time of $O(n\cdot\text{poly}(\log n))$.
  Our results immediately extend to all families of separable graphs.

their inner workings and physical connection to the host are poorly understood
due to a lack of angular resolution. Infrared interferometry makes it possible
to resolve the circumnuclear dust in the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy, Circinus.
Previous observations have revealed complex structures and polar dust emission
but interpretation was limited to simple models. MATISSE makes it possible to
image these structures for the first time. We observed the Circinus Galaxy with
VLTI/MATISSE, producing 150 correlated flux spectra and 100 closure phase
spectra. We reconstructed images in the N-band at ~10 mas resolution. We fit
blackbody functions with dust extinction to several aperture-extracted fluxes
from the images to produce a temperature distribution of central dusty
structures. We find significant substructure in the circumnuclear dust: central
unresolved flux of ~0.5 Jy, a thin disk 1.9 pc in diameter oriented along ~45
deg,and a ~4x1.5 pc polar emission extending orthogonal to the disk. The polar
emission exhibits patchiness, which we attribute to clumpy dust. Flux
enhancements to the east and west of the disk are seen for the first time. We
distinguish the temperature profiles of the disk and of the polar emission: the
disk shows a steep temperature gradient indicative of denser material; the
polar profile is flatter, indicating clumpiness and/or lower dust density. The
unresolved flux is fitted with a high temperature, ~370 K. The polar dust
remains warm (~200 K) out to 1.5 pc from the disk. The recovered morphology and
temperature distribution resembles modeling of accretion disks with
radiation-driven winds at large scales, but we placed new constraints on the
subparsec dust. The subparsec features imaged here place new constraints on the
physical modeling of circumnuclear dust in active galaxies.

not scale to a pangenomic level. Recently, Gagie et al. [JACM 20] introduced
the $r$-index that is a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)-based index able to

observe that our method is up to 8 times smaller, while up to 19 times slower

Such chiral edge current (CEC) eliminates any backscattering, giving rise to

retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration are major causes of blindness
and vision impairment. There is a need for novel decision support tools that
can simplify and speed up the diagnosis of these pathologies. A key step in
this process is to automatically estimate the quality of the fundus images to
make sure these are interpretable by a human operator or a machine learning
model. We present a novel fundus image quality scale and deep learning (DL)
model that can estimate fundus image quality relative to this new scale.
  Methods: A total of 1,245 images were graded for quality by two
ophthalmologists within the range 1-10, with a resolution of 0.5. A DL
regression model was trained for fundus image quality assessment. The
architecture used was Inception-V3. The model was developed using a total of
89,947 images from 6 databases, of which 1,245 were labeled by the specialists
and the remaining 88,702 images were used for pre-training and semi-supervised
learning. The final DL model was evaluated on an internal test set (n=209) as
well as an external test set (n=194).
  Results: The final DL model, denoted FundusQ-Net, achieved a mean absolute
error of 0.61 (0.54-0.68) on the internal test set. When evaluated as a binary
classification model on the public DRIMDB database as an external test set the
model obtained an accuracy of 99%.
  Significance: the proposed algorithm provides a new robust tool for automated
quality grading of fundus images.

(NLOS) imaging, is becoming a reality thanks to major advances in imaging
hardware and reconstruction algorithms. A recent development towards practical
NLOS imaging, Nam et al. demonstrated a high-speed non-confocal imaging system
that operates at 5Hz, 100x faster than the prior art. This enormous gain in
acquisition rate, however, necessitates numerous approximations in light
transport, breaking many existing NLOS reconstruction methods that assume an
idealized image formation model. To bridge the gap, we present a novel deep
model that incorporates the complementary physics priors of wave propagation
and volume rendering into a neural network for high-quality and robust NLOS
reconstruction. This orchestrated design regularizes the solution space by
relaxing the image formation model, resulting in a deep model that generalizes
well on real captures despite being exclusively trained on synthetic data.
Further, we devise a unified learning framework that enables our model to be
flexibly trained using diverse supervision signals, including target intensity
images or even raw NLOS transient measurements. Once trained, our model renders
both intensity and depth images at inference time in a single forward pass,
capable of processing more than 5 captures per second on a high-end GPU.
Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we show that our
method outperforms prior physics and learning based approaches on both
synthetic and real measurements. We anticipate that our method along with the
fast capturing system will accelerate future development of NLOS imaging for
real world applications that require high-speed imaging.

bodies through local interactions between individual cells (morphogenesis) is a
long-standing challenge of developmental biology. Recently, the Neural Cellular
Automata (NCA) model was proposed as a way to find local system rules that
produce a desired global behaviour, such as growing and persisting a predefined
target pattern, by repeatedly applying the same rule over a grid starting from
a single cell. In this work, we argue that the original Growing NCA model has
an important limitation: anisotropy of the learned update rule. This implies
the presence of an external factor that orients the cells in a particular
direction. In other words, ""physical"" rules of the underlying system are not
invariant to rotation, thus prohibiting the existence of differently oriented
instances of the target pattern on the same grid. We propose a modified
Isotropic NCA (IsoNCA) model that does not have this limitation. We demonstrate
that such cell systems can be trained to grow accurate asymmetrical patterns
through either of two methods: (1) by breaking symmetries using structured
seeds or (2) by introducing a rotation-reflection invariant training objective
and relying on symmetry-breaking caused by asynchronous cell updates.

longer static but evolves with time. When GWs from the source pass through the
binary lens, their amplitudes can be modulated, which is similar to the
phenomenon of amplitude modulation (AM) in radio communication. We find that
even the frequency of the binary lens itself is too low to be detected by the
LISA detection band, the sidebands in the spectrum of the lensed GWs due to AM
can still be within the sensitive range of the detection band. Moreover, we
also calculate the relative differences of SNR (mismatch) between the lensed

9.18%. Since mismatch does not depend on the amplitude of wavefrom, the
differences between the binary lensed and unlensed waveforms are substantial.
This provides a robust way to identify the lensing event for the LISA project

object detection, where relatively coarse grid resolutions are commonly used to

leveraging the exact relative positions of points, before grid rendering. This
has significant benefits for a subsequent grid-based convolutional detection

found that there not only exists a obvious temporal correlation in each parking

view of this, this paper proposed a graph data-based model ST-GBGRU
(Spatial-Temporal Graph Based Gated Recurrent Unit), the number of VPSs can be
predicted both in short-term (i.e., within 30 min) and in long-term (i.e., over

contains hundreds to thousands of nodes. This high dimensionality makes it
difficult to analyze the reservoir computer using tools from dynamical systems
theory. Additionally, the need to create and connect large numbers of nonlinear

increase the rank and memory of the reservoir computer, and the set of
nonlinear nodes may create an embedding of the input dynamical system. We use
this time-shifting technique to obtain excellent performance from an

subgrid-scale processes, e.g., for cloud microphysics. These parameterizations
are a well-known source of uncertainty in weather forecasts that can be
quantified via algorithmic differentiation, which computes the sensitivities of
prognostic variables to changes in model parameters. It is particularly
interesting to use sensitivities to analyze the validity of physical
assumptions on which microphysical parameterizations in the numerical model
source code are based. In this article, we consider the use case of strongly
ascending trajectories, so-called warm conveyor belt trajectories, known to
have a significant impact on intense surface precipitation rates in
extratropical cyclones. We present visual analytics solutions to analyze
interactively the sensitivities of a selected prognostic variable, i.e. rain
mass density, to multiple model parameters along such trajectories. We propose
a visual interface that enables to a) compare the values of multiple
sensitivities at a single time step on multiple trajectories, b) assess the
spatio-temporal relationships between sensitivities and the shape and location
of trajectories, and c) a comparative analysis of the temporal development of
sensitivities along multiple trajectories. We demonstrate how our approach
enables atmospheric scientists to interactively analyze the uncertainty in the
microphysical parameterizations, and along the trajectories, with respect to a
selected prognostic variable. We apply our approach to the analysis of
convective trajectories within the extratropical cyclone ""Vladiana"", which
occurred between 22-25 September 2016 over the North Atlantic.

Numerical examples show that the proposed single-grid solver can improve the

computational efficiencies even once for the cases where high-resolution

First, I show
that a gravitational wave pulse from a major merger of massive black holes at
the Galactic center induces a permanent increase in the Earth-Moon separation.
Second, I show that General Relativity sets an absolute upper limit on the
energy flux observed from a cosmological source as a function of its redshift.
Third, I consider the implications of modified inertia at low accelerations for
rockets. An attractive interpretation of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) as
an alternative to dark matter, changes the inertia of matter at low
accelerations. I show that if inertia is modified at low accelerations, this
suppresses the exponential factor for the required fuel mass in low
acceleration journeys. Fourth, I show that in MOND the amplitude of the
observed dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can originate from the
primordial fluctuation amplitude on the scale of the cosmic horizon. Fifth, I
show that the tidal gravitational potential of the Milky-Way galaxy removes
fuzzy dark matter from its satellite dwarf galaxies through quantum-mechanical
tunneling. Sixth, I show that a charged particle can be accelerated to
arbitrarily high energies by maintaining a permanent resonance with the phase
of a planar gravitational wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field.
Seventh, I show that non-relativistic objects traveling in intergalactic space
at an initial peculiar velocity $v$ will traverse in the future of the LCDM
cosmological model a maximum comoving distance of ~(v/1.7H_0), irrespective of
travel time, where H_0 is the Hubble constant. To reach beyond the Virgo
cluster of galaxies, requires an initial peculiar speed >3,000km/s, a hundred
times faster than the chemical rockets launched to space so far.

which, at the time of landing, may ignite new fires beyond the direct ignition
zone of the main fire. Spot fires that occur far from the original burn unit
are rare but have consequential ramifications since their prediction and
control remains challenging. To facilitate their prediction, we examine three
methods for quantifying the landing distribution of firebrands: crude Monte
Carlo simulations, importance sampling, and large deviation theory (LDT). In
particular, we propose an LDT method that accurately and parsimoniously
quantifies the low probability events at the tail of the landing distribution.
In contrast, Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods are most efficient in
quantifying the high probability landing distances near the mode of the
distribution. However, they become computationally intractable for quantifying
the tail of the distribution due to the large sample size required. We also
show that the most probable landing distance grows linearly with the mean
characteristic velocity of the wind field. Furthermore, defining the relative
landed mass as the proportion of mass landed at a given distance from the main
fire, we derive an explicit formula which allows computing this quantity as a
function of the landing distribution at a negligible computational cost. We
numerically demonstrate our findings on two prescribed wind fields.

suppression in {\phi}-OFDR with multi-core fiber. By exploiting the independent
nature of the randomness in the distribution of reflective index in each of the
cores, the drastic phase fluctuations due to the fading phenomina can be
effectively alleviated by applying weighted vectorial averaging for the
Rayleigh backscattering traces from each of the cores with distinct fading
distributions. With the consistent linear response with respect to external
excitation of interest for each of the cores, demonstration for the propsoed
{\phi}-OFDR with a commercial seven-core fiber has achieved highly sensitive
quantitative distributed vibration sensing with about 2.2 nm length precision
and 2 cm sensing resolution along the 500 m fiber, corresponding to a range
resolution factor as high as about about 4E-5. Featuring long distance, high

promising potentials in various sensing techniques for a wide range of

research, and treatments. Most current works are limited to a single dataset
where data patterns are similar. But EEG signals are highly non-stationary,
resulting in model's poor generalization to new users, sessions or datasets.
Thus, designing a model that can generalize to new datasets is beneficial and
indispensable. To mitigate distribution discrepancy across datasets, we propose
to achieve Disentangled and Side-aware Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DSUDA)
for cross-dataset tinnitus diagnosis. A disentangled auto-encoder is developed
to decouple class-irrelevant information from the EEG signals to improve the
classifying ability. The side-aware unsupervised domain adaptation module
adapts the class-irrelevant information as domain variance to a new dataset and
excludes the variance to obtain the class-distill features for the new dataset
classification. It also align signals of left and right ears to overcome
inherent EEG pattern difference. We compare DSUDA with state-of-the-art
methods, and our model achieves significant improvements over competitors
regarding comprehensive evaluation criteria. The results demonstrate our model
can successfully generalize to a new dataset and effectively diagnose tinnitus.

overall disease severity, and demographic attributes; further, dataset formats
may differ, impacting model performance. This paper proposes a side-aware
meta-learning for cross-dataset tinnitus diagnosis, which can effectively
classify tinnitus in subjects of divergent ages and genders from different data
collection processes. Owing to the superiority of meta-learning, our method
does not rely on large-scale datasets like conventional deep learning models.
Moreover, we design a subject-specific training process to assist the model in
fitting the data pattern of different patients or healthy people. Our method
achieves a high accuracy of 73.8\% in the cross-dataset classification. We
conduct an extensive analysis to show the effectiveness of side information of

a social engineering attack which has a massive global impact, destroying the

username, passwords, debit card information and so on. In order to detect
zero-hour attacks and protect end-users from these attacks, various

websites to know whether they are safe or not, which may lead to infecting
their system. In this paper, we propose a method where end-users can detect the
genuineness of the sites without visiting them. The proposed method collects
legitimate and phishing URLs and extract features from them. The extracted

Regression, Random Forest,CatBoost, XGBoost and Multilayer perceptron. The
method is tested by developing into an extension so that the end-users can use
it when browsing. In the browser extension when the user takes the cursor over
any link, a pop-up appears showing the nature of the website i.e., safe site or
deceptive site and then a confirm box shows up asking the user whether they
want to visit or not. The performance of the approach is tested using a dataset
consisting of 2000 phishing and legitimate website URLs and the method is able
to detect the sites correctly in very little time. Random-Forest is chosen for
constructing the model as it gives the highest accuracy of 95%.
