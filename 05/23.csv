In many factory systems, production processes must be continuously controlled
in order to maintain product quality. Especially challenging are the systems
that must balance in real-time between stringent resource consumption
constraints and the risk of defective end-product. There is a need for
automated quality control systems as human control is tedious and error-prone.
We see machine learning as a viable choice for developing automated quality
control systems, but integrating such system with existing factory automation

Methodologies for systematic parameterization of the underlying energy

learning of force fields that can accurately reproduce the conformational

generalizes the noise contrastive estimation method with umbrella sampling to

the Trp-cage protein, we found that the technique produces force fields that
thoroughly capture the thermodynamics of the folding process despite the use of
only $\alpha$-Carbons in the coarse-grained model. We further showed that
potential contrasting could be applied over large datasets that combine the

equations that relates terminal density and option prices. Using a
discretization of the terminal density, we write these integral equations as a
system of linear equations. We show that the kernel matrix of this system is in
general ill-conditioned, so that it can not be solved for the discretized
density using a naive approach. Instead, we construct a sparse model for the
kernel matrix using the singular value decomposition (SVD), which allows us not

also determines the computational effort and accuracy of our method. In order
to allow for the treatment of realistic inputs that may contain arbitrage, we
reformulate the system of linear equations as an optimization problem, in which
the SVD-transformed density minimizes the error between the input prices and
the arbitrage-free prices generated by our method. To further stabilize the
method in the presence of noisy input prices or arbitrage, we apply an
$L_1$-regularization to the SVD-transformed density. Our approach, which is
inspired by recent progress in theoretical physics, offers a flexible and
efficient framework for the arbitrage-free interpolation of plain-vanilla

instability due to light- or electrical bias induced phase- segregation
restricts the exploitation of the entire bandgap range. Previous experimental
and theoretical work suggests that excited states or charge-carriers trigger
the process but the exact mechanism is still under debate. To identify the
mechanism and cause of light-induced phase-segregation phenomena we investigate
the full compositional range of methylammonium lead bromide/iodide samples,
MAPb(Br$_x$I$_{1-x}$)$_3$ with $x = 0\ldots 1$, by simultaneous in-situ X-ray
diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy during illumination. The
quantitative comparison of composition-dependent in-situ XRD and PL shows that
at excitation densities of 1 sun, only the initial stage of photo-segregation
can be rationalized with the previously established thermodynamic models.
However, we observe a progression of the phase-segregation that can only be
rationalized by considering long-lived accumulative photo-induced material
alterations. We suggest that (additional) photo-induced defects, possibly
halide vacancies and interstitials, need to be considered to fully rationalize

photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the charge state of cations present in this

a long-range ferromagnetic ordering at Tc ~ 76 K owing to the presence of super
exchange interaction between Co2+ and Mn4+ moments. Furthermore, the
magnetization isotherm at 5 K shows a hysteresis curve that confirms
ferromagnetic behavior of this double perovskite. We observed a re-entrant
glassy state in the intermediate temperature regime, which is attributed to
inherent anti-site disorder and competing interactions. A large magnetocaloric
effect has been observed much below the ferromagnetic transition temperature.
The temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy studies support the presence of
spin-phonon coupling and short-range order above Tc in this double perovskite.
The stabilization of magnetic ordering and charge states is further analyzed
through electronic structure calculations. The latter also infers the compound
to be a narrow band gap insulator with the gap arising between the lower and

that there are constants $c(H)$ and $C(H)$ such that the following holds for
the complete directed graph $D_n$. There are at most $C\log n$ directed acyclic
subgraphs of $D_n$ that cover every $H$-copy of $D_n$, while fewer than $c\log
n$ directed acyclic subgraphs of $D_n$ do not cover all $H$-copies. Here this
dichotomy is considerably strengthened. Let ${\vec G}(n,p)$ denote the random
directed graph. The {\em fractional arboricity} of $H$ is $a(H) = max
\{\frac{|E(H')|}{|V(H')|-1}\}$, where the maximum is over all non-singleton
subgraphs of $H$. If $a(H) = \frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|-1}$ then $H$ is {\em totally
balanced}. Complete graphs, complete multipartite graphs, cycles, trees, and,
in fact, almost all graphs, are totally balanced. It is proved:
  1) Let $H$ be a dag with $h$ vertices and $m$ edges other than a rooted star.
For every $a^* > a(H)$ there exists $c^* = c^*(a^*,H) > 0$ such that almost
surely $G \sim {\vec G}(n,n^{-1/a^*})$ has the property that every set $X$ of
at most $c^*\log n$ directed acyclic subgraphs of $G$ does not cover all
$H$-copies of $G$. Moreover, there exists $s(H) = m/2 + O(m^{4/5}h^{1/5})$ such
that the following stronger assertion holds for any such $X$: There is an
$H$-copy in $G$ that has no more than $s(H)$ of its edges covered by each
element of $X$.
  2) If $H$ is totally balanced then for every $0 < a^* < a(H)$, almost surely
$G \sim {\vec G}(n,n^{-1/a^*})$ has a single directed acyclic subgraph that
covers all its $H$-copies.
  As for the first result, note that if $h=o(m)$ then $s(H)=(1+o_m(1))m/2$ is
about half of the edges of $H$. In fact, for infinitely many $H$ it holds that
$s(H)=m/2$, optimally. As for the second result, the requirement that $H$ is
totally balanced cannot, generally, be relaxed.

since they are responsible for propagating uncertainties from the data down to
the model parameters. However, when data vectors are large, in order to
estimate accurate and precise matrices we need huge numbers of observations, or
rather costly simulations - neither of which may be viable. In this work we
propose a machine learning approach to alleviate this problem in the context of
the matrices used in the study of large-scale structure. With only a small
amount of data (matrices built with samples of 50-200 halo power spectra) we
are able to provide significantly improved matrices, which are almost
indistinguishable from the ones built from much larger samples (thousands of
spectra). In order to perform this task we trained convolutional neural
networks to denoise the matrices, using in the training process a data set made
up entirely of spectra extracted from simple, inexpensive halo simulations
(mocks). We then show that the method not only removes the noise in the
matrices of the cheap simulation, but it is also able to successfully denoise
the matrices of halo power spectra from N-body simulations. We compare the
denoised to the other matrices using several metrics, and in all of them they
score better, without any signs of spurious artifacts. With the help of the
Wishart distribution we derive an analytical extrapolation for the effective
sample augmentation allowed by the denoiser. Finally, we show that, by using
the denoised matrices, the cosmological parameters can be recovered with nearly
the same accuracy as when using matrices built with a sample of 30,000 spectra
in the case of the cheap simulations, and with 15,000 spectra in the case of
the N-body simulations. Of particular interest is the bias in the Hubble
parameter $H_0$, which was significantly reduced after applying the denoiser.

attention with wide applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent
years. While one of the key principles of GEC is to keep the correct parts
unchanged and avoid over-correction, previous sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)
models generate results from scratch, which are not guaranteed to follow the
original sentence structure and may suffer from the over-correction problem. In
the meantime, the recently proposed sequence tagging models can overcome the
over-correction problem by only generating edit operations, but are conditioned
on human designed language-specific tagging labels. In this paper, we combine
the pros and alleviate the cons of both models by proposing a novel
Sequence-to-Action~(S2A) module. The S2A module jointly takes the source and
target sentences as input, and is able to automatically generate a token-level
action sequence before predicting each token, where each action is generated
from three choices named SKIP, COPY and GENerate. Then the actions are fused
with the basic seq2seq framework to provide final predictions. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark datasets of both English and Chinese GEC tasks.
Our model consistently outperforms the seq2seq baselines, while being able to
significantly alleviate the over-correction problem as well as holding better
generality and diversity in the generation results compared to the sequence
tagging models.

detection is crucial to avert later vision impairment. Nonetheless,
implementing large-scale screening programmes is usually not viable, since the
population at-risk is large and the analysis must be performed by expert
clinicians. Also, the diagnosis of AMD is considered to be particularly
difficult, as it is characterized by many different lesions that, in many
cases, resemble those of other macular diseases. To overcome these issues,
several works have proposed automatic methods for the detection of AMD in
retinography images, the most widely used modality for the screening of the
disease. Nowadays, most of these works use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
for the binary classification of images into AMD and non-AMD classes. In this
work, we propose a novel approach based on CNNs that simultaneously performs
AMD diagnosis and the classification of its potential lesions. This latter
secondary task has not yet been addressed in this domain, and provides
complementary useful information that improves the diagnosis performance and
helps understanding the decision. A CNN model is trained using retinography
images with image-level labels for both AMD and lesion presence, which are
relatively easy to obtain. The experiments conducted in several public datasets

satisfactory results in the identification of most lesions.

(2) heteroskedastic Gaussian long memory errors. In the homoskedastic
long-memory error case, the estimator is completely adaptive with respect to
the long-memory parameter. In the heteroskedastic long-memory case, the

the heteroskedasticity is of polynomial form. In either case, the convergence
rates depend on the long-memory parameter only when long-memory is strong

  Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computing paradigm that
represents, manipulates, and communicates data using very long random vectors
(aka hypervectors). Among different hardware platforms capable of executing HDC
algorithms, in-memory computing (IMC) systems have been recently proved to be
one of the most energy-efficient options, due to hypervector manipulations in
the memory itself that reduces data movement. Although implementations of HDC
on single IMC cores have been made, their parallelization is still unresolved
due to the communication challenges that these novel architectures impose and
that traditional Networks-on-Chip and Networks-in-Package were not designed
for. To cope with this difficulty, we propose the use of wireless on-chip
communication technology in unique ways. We are particularly interested in
physically distributing a large number of IMC cores performing similarity
search across a chip, and maintaining the classification accuracy when each of
which is queried with a slightly different version of a bundled hypervector. To
achieve it, we introduce a novel over-the-air computing that consists of
defining different binary decision regions in the receivers so as to compute
the logical majority operation (i.e., bundling, or superposition) required in
HDC. It introduces moderate overheads of a single antenna and receiver per IMC
core. By doing so, we achieve a joint broadcast distribution and computation
with a performance and efficiency unattainable with wired interconnects, which
in turn enables massive parallelization of the architecture. It is demonstrated
that the proposed approach allows to both bundle at least three hypervectors
and scale similarity search to 64 IMC cores seamlessly, while incurring an
average bit error ratio of 0.01 without any impact in the accuracy of a generic
HDC-based classifier working with 512-bit vectors.

features of an input image at various levels of a convolutional neural network

techniques such as Integrated Gradients (IG), that are not affected by that

introduce a new technique to produce visual explanations for the predictions of
a CNN. Like Grad-CAM, our method can be applied to any layer of the network,
and like Integrated Gradients it is not affected by the problem of vanishing
gradients. For efficiency, gradient integration is performed numerically at the

heatmaps produced by our algorithm are better focused in the areas of interest,

gives rise to a non-Fermi liquid in the normal state and is attractive for
pairing. The two trends compete with each other. We search for odd-frequency

In particular, for the most interesting cases, the theory develops a

adding an infinite number of higher $[T\bar{T}]_{s>1}$ irrelevant operators

systematic updates of decision variables, therefore their precise nature
informs conclusions about underlying heuristic strategies and learning
processes. However, random drifts in decision variables can corrupt this
inference by mimicking the signatures of systematic updates. Hence, identifying
the trial-by-trial evolution of decision variables requires methods that can
robustly account for such drifts. Recent studies (Lak'20, Mendon\c{c}a'20) have
made important advances in this direction, by proposing a convenient method to
correct for the influence of slow drifts in decision criterion, a key decision
variable. Here we apply this correction to a variety of updating scenarios, and
evaluate its performance. We show that the correction fails for a wide range of
commonly assumed systematic updating strategies, distorting one's inference
away from the veridical strategies towards a narrow subset. To address these
limitations, we propose a model-based approach for disambiguating systematic
updates from random drifts, and demonstrate its success on real and synthetic
datasets. We show that this approach accurately recovers the latent trajectory
of drifts in decision criterion as well as the generative systematic updates
from simulated data. Our results offer recommendations for methods to account

advantages of incorporating assumptions about the generative process directly

trapped by a new closed trapped surface produced by its own backreaction. Thus
no detectable signal of the echo will emerge to infinity. The only assumption

curved spacetime. Thus if echoes are actually detected, then we would face a

flux signals caused by brain activity using sensor arrays located on or above
the scalp. A common strategy for monitoring brain activity is to place sensors
on a nearly uniform grid, or sensor array, around the head. By increasing the
total number of sensors, higher spatial-frequency components of brain activity
can be resolved as dictated by Nyquist sampling theory. Currently, there are
few principled mathematical architectures for sensor placement aside from
Nyquist considerations. However, global brain activity often exhibits
low-dimensional patterns of spatio-temporal dynamics. The low-dimensional
global patterns can be computed from the singular value decomposition and can
be leveraged to select a small number of sensors optimized for reconstructing
brain signals and localizing brain sources. Moreover, a smaller number of
sensors which are systematically chosen can outperform the entire sensor array
when considering noisy measurements. We propose a greedy selection algorithm
based upon the QR decomposition that is computationally efficient to implement
for MEG. We demonstrate the performance of the sensor selection algorithm for
the tasks of signal reconstruction and localization. The performance is
dependent upon source localization, with shallow sources easily identified and
reconstructed, and deep sources more difficult to locate. Our findings suggest
that principled methods for sensor selection can improve MEG capabilities and
potentially add cost savings for monitoring brain-wide activity.

With historical measurement data, EV chargers can take better-informed actions

The solutions that do not depend on power distribution topology information,

logistic regression loss function could be re-written in terms of a pre-chosen
""base class"" and applied the new derivatives in the popular boosting framework.
In order to make use of the new derivatives, one must have a strategy to
identify/choose the base class at each boosting iteration. The idea of
""adaptive base class boost"" (ABC-Boost) in ICML'09, adopted a computationally
expensive ""exhaustive search"" strategy for the base class at each iteration. It
has been well demonstrated that ABC-Boost, when integrated with trees, can
achieve substantial improvements in many multi-class classification tasks.
Furthermore, the work in UAI'10 derived the explicit second-order tree split
gain formula which typically improved the classification accuracy considerably,
compared with using only the fist-order information for tree-splitting, for
both multi-class and binary-class classification tasks. In this paper, we
develop a unified framework for effectively selecting the base class by
introducing a series of ideas to improve the computational efficiency of
ABC-Boost. Our framework has parameters $(s,g,w)$. At each boosting iteration,
we only search for the ""$s$-worst classes"" (instead of all classes) to
determine the base class. We also allow a ""gap"" $g$ when conducting the search.
That is, we only search for the base class at every $g+1$ iterations. We
furthermore allow a ""warm up"" stage by only starting the search after $w$
boosting iterations. The parameters $s$, $g$, $w$, can be viewed as tunable
parameters and certain combinations of $(s,g,w)$ may even lead to better test
accuracy than the ""exhaustive search"" strategy. Overall, our proposed framework
provides a robust and reliable scheme for implementing ABC-Boost in practice.

projective space) have been studied for several reasons, including the study of
linear ordinary differential equations of order $n+1$. Taking Frenet frames
allows us to obtain corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$;
recall that $\Pi: Spin_{n+1} \to Flag_{n+1}$ is the universal cover of the
space of flags. Let $L(z_0;z_1)$ be the space of such curves $\Gamma$ with
prescribed endpoints $\Gamma(0) = z_0$, $\Gamma(1) = z_1$. The aim of this
paper is to determine the homotopy type of the spaces $L_3(z_0;z_1)$ for all
$z_0, z_1 \in Spin_4$. Recall that $Spin_4 = S^3 \times S^3 \subset H \times
H$, where $H$ is the ring of quaternions.
  This paper relies heavily on previous publications. The earliest such paper
solves the corresponding problem for curves in $S^2$. Another previous result
(with B. Shapiro) reduces the problem to $z_0 = 1$ and $z_1 \in Quat_4$ where
$Quat_4 \subset Spin_4$ is a finite group of order $16$ with center $Z(Quat_4)
= \{(\pm 1,\pm 1)\}$. A more recent paper shows that for $z_1 \in Quat_4
\smallsetminus Z(Quat_4)$ we have a homotopy equivalence $L_3(1;z_1) \approx
\Omega Spin_4$. In this paper we compute the homotopy type of $L_3(1;z_1)$ for
$z_1 \in Z(Quat_4)$: it is equivalent to the infinite wedge of $\Omega Spin_4$
with an infinite countable family of spheres (as for the case $n = 2$).
  The structure of the proof is roughly the same as for the case $n = 2$ but
some of the steps are much harder. In both cases we construct explicit subsets
$Y \subset L_n(z_0;z_1)$ for which the inclusion $Y \subset \Omega
Spin_{n+1}(z_0;z_1)$ is a homotopy equivalence. For $n = 3$, this is done by
considering the itineraries of such curves. The itinerary of a curve in
$L_n(1;z_1)$ is a finite word in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \smallsetminus \{e\}$ of
nontrivial permutations.

angular momentum redistribution leads to accretion and outward disc spreading.
Recently, the hypothesis that accretion is due, instead, to angular momentum
removal by magnetic winds gained new popularity: no disc spreading is expected
in this case. In this paper, we run several one-dimensional gas and dust
simulations to make predictions on the time-evolution of disc sizes \textit{in
the dust} and to assess whether they can be used to understand how discs
evolve. We show that viscous and magnetic wind models have very different dust
disc radii. In particular, MHD wind models are compact and their sizes either
remain constant or decrease with time. On the contrary, discs become larger
with time in the viscous case (when $\alpha\gtrsim10^{-3}$). Although current
observations lack enough sensitivity to discriminate between these two
scenarios, higher-sensitivity surveys could be fruitful to this goal on a
$1\,{\rm to}\,10\,{\rm Myr}$ age range. When compared with the available ALMA
Band~7 data, both viscous and magnetic wind models are compatible with the
observationally-inferred dust radii in Lupus, Chamaeleon~I and Upper Sco.
Furthermore, in the drift-dominated regime, the size-luminosity correlation is
reproduced in Lupus, both in Band~7 and 3, while in Upper Sco a different slope
than in the data is predicted. Sub-structures (potentially undetected) can
explain several outliers with large observed sizes. Higher-angular-resolution
observations will be helpful to test our predictions in the case of more
compact discs, expected in both frameworks, particularly at the age of Upper
Sco.

black-box models or create explanations for any kind of models (i.e., they are
model-agnostic), while leaving explanations of interpretable models largely
underexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by focusing on explanations for
a specific interpretable model, namely pattern-based logistic regression (PLR)
for binary text classification. We do so because, albeit interpretable, PLR is
challenging when it comes to explanations. In particular, we found that a
standard way to extract explanations from this model does not consider
relations among the features, making the explanations hardly plausible to
humans. Hence, we propose AXPLR, a novel explanation method using (forms of)
computational argumentation to generate explanations (for outputs computed by
PLR) which unearth model agreements and disagreements among the features.
Specifically, we use computational argumentation as follows: we see features
(patterns) in PLR as arguments in a form of quantified bipolar argumentation
frameworks (QBAFs) and extract attacks and supports between arguments based on
specificity of the arguments; we understand logistic regression as a gradual
semantics for these QBAFs, used to determine the arguments' dialectic strength;
and we study standard properties of gradual semantics for QBAFs in the context
of our argumentative re-interpretation of PLR, sanctioning its suitability for
explanatory purposes. We then show how to extract intuitive explanations (for
outputs computed by PLR) from the constructed QBAFs. Finally, we conduct an
empirical evaluation and two experiments in the context of human-AI
collaboration to demonstrate the advantages of our resulting AXPLR method.

decentralized optimization also discloses agents' information, which is
undesirable or even unacceptable when involved data are sensitive. This paper
proposes two gradient based decentralized optimization algorithms that can
protect participating agents' privacy without compromising optimization
accuracy or incurring heavy communication/computational overhead. This is in
distinct difference from differential privacy based approaches which have to
trade optimization accuracy for privacy, or encryption based approaches which
incur heavy communication and computational overhead. Both algorithms leverage
a judiciously designed mixing matrix and time-varying uncoordinated stepsizes
to enable privacy, one using diminishing stepsizes while the other using
non-diminishing stepsizes. In both algorithms, when interacting with any one of
its neighbors, a participating agent only needs to share one message in each
iteration to reach convergence to an exact optimal solution, which is in
contrast to most gradient-tracking based algorithms requiring every agent to
share two messages (an optimization variable and an auxiliary gradient-tracking
variable) under non-diminishing stepsizes. Furthermore, both algorithms can
guarantee the privacy of a participating agent even when all information shared
by the agent are accessible to an adversary, a scenario in which most existing
accuracy-maintaining privacy approaches will fail to protect privacy.
Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

five-year survey to explore the nature of dark energy with spectroscopy of 40
million galaxies and quasars. DESI will determine precise redshifts and employ
the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation method to measure distances from the nearby
universe to z > 3.5, as well as measure the growth of structure and probe
potential modifications to general relativity. In this paper we describe the
significant instrumentation we developed for the DESI survey. The new
instrumentation includes a wide-field, 3.2-deg diameter prime-focus corrector
that focuses the light onto 5020 robotic fiber positioners on the 0.812 m
diameter, aspheric focal surface. The positioners and their fibers are divided
among ten wedge-shaped petals. Each petal is connected to one of ten
spectrographs via a contiguous, high-efficiency, nearly 50 m fiber cable
bundle. The ten spectrographs each use a pair of dichroics to split the light
into three channels that together record the light from 360 - 980 nm with a
resolution of 2000 to 5000. We describe the science requirements, technical
requirements on the instrumentation, and management of the project. DESI was
installed at the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, and we also describe the
facility upgrades to prepare for DESI and the installation and functional
verification process. DESI has achieved all of its performance goals, and the
DESI survey began in May 2021. Some performance highlights include RMS
positioner accuracy better than 0.1"", SNR per \sqrt{\AA} > 0.5 for a z > 2
quasar with flux 0.28e-17 erg/s/cm^2/A at 380 nm in 4000s, and median SNR = 7
of the [OII] doublet at 8e-17 erg/s/cm^2 in a 1000s exposure for emission line
galaxies at z = 1.4 - 1.6. We conclude with highlights from the on-sky
validation and commissioning of the instrument, key successes, and lessons
learned. (abridged)

Newton-Raphson solver then computes the control input in real time. We first
benchmark this nonlinear control approach against a PID controller on a
mass-spring-damper simulation. We then study experimental results on two
experimental rigs with different sensing, actuation and computational hardware:
a tendon-based platform with embedded LightLace sensors and a HASEL-based
platform with magnetic sensors. Experimental results indicate effective
high-bandwidth tracking of reference paths (greater than or equal to 120 Hz)
with a small memory footprint (less than or equal to 6.4% of flash memory). The
measured path following error does not exceed 2mm in the tendon-based platform.
The simulated path following error does not exceed 1mm in the HASEL-based
platform. The mean power consumption of this approach in an ARM Cortex-M4f

Lite models and equivalent on-device code. In-material intelligence enables a
new class of composites that infuse autonomy into structures and systems with

Each agent belongs to a group, and a group is successful if and only if its
members receive enough tickets for everyone. A lottery is efficient if it
maximizes the number of agents in successful groups, and fair if it gives every
group the same chance of success. We study the efficiency and fairness of
existing approaches, and propose practical alternatives.
  If agents must identify the members of their group, a natural solution is the
Group Lottery, which orders groups uniformly at random and processes them
sequentially. We provide tight bounds on the inefficiency and unfairness of
this mechanism, and describe modifications that obtain a fairer allocation.
  If agents may request multiple tickets without identifying members of their
group, the most common mechanism is the Individual Lottery, which orders agents
uniformly at random and awards each their request until no tickets remain.
Because each member of a group may apply for (and win) tickets, this approach
can yield arbitrarily unfair and inefficient outcomes. As an alternative, we
propose the Weighted Individual Lottery, in which the processing order is
biased against agents with large requests. Although it is still possible to
have multiple winners in a group, this simple modification makes this event
much less likely. As a result, the Weighted Individual Lottery is approximately
fair and approximately efficient, and similar to the Group Lottery when there
are many more agents than tickets.

sciences variables such as pollutant concentrations at different levels of the
atmosphere, a special property is observed: the covariances and
cross-covariances are stronger in certain directions. This property is
attributed to the presence of natural forces, such as wind, which cause the
transport and dispersion of these variables. This spatio-temporal dynamics
prompted the use of the Lagrangian reference frame alongside any Gaussian
spatio-temporal geostatistical model. Under this modeling framework, a whole
new class was birthed and was known as the class of spatio-temporal covariance
functions under the Lagrangian framework, with several developments already
established in the univariate setting, in both stationary and nonstationary
formulations, but less so in the multivariate case. Despite the many advances
in this modeling approach, efforts have yet to be directed to probing the case
for the use of multiple advections, especially when several variables are
involved. Accounting for multiple advections would make the Lagrangian
framework a more viable approach in modeling realistic multivariate transport
scenarios. In this work, we establish a class of Lagrangian spatio-temporal
cross-covariance functions with multiple advections, study its properties, and
demonstrate its use on a bivariate pollutant dataset of particulate matter in
Saudi Arabia.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dynamical latent variable modeling has been significantly invested over the
last couple of decades with established solutions encompassing generative
processes like the state-space model (SSM) and discriminative processes like a
recurrent or a deep neural network (DNN). These solutions are powerful tools
with promising results; however, surprisingly they were never put together in a
unified model to analyze complex multivariate time-series data. A very recent
modeling approach, called the direct discriminative decoder (DDD) model,
proposes a principal solution to combine SMM and DNN models, with promising
results in decoding underlying latent processes, e.g. rat movement trajectory,
through high-dimensional neural recordings. The DDD consists of a) a state
transition process, as per the classical dynamical models, and b) a
discriminative process, like DNN, in which the conditional distribution of
states is defined as a function of the current observations and their recent
history. Despite promising results of the DDD model, no training solutions, in
the context of DNN, have been utilized for this model. Here, we propose how DNN
parameters along with an optimal history term can be simultaneously estimated
as a part of the DDD model. We use the D4 abbreviation for a DDD with a DNN as
its discriminative process. We showed the D4 decoding performance in both
simulation and (relatively) high-dimensional neural data. In both datasets, D4
performance surpasses the state-of-art decoding solutions, including those of
SSM and DNNs. The key success of DDD and potentially D4 is efficient
utilization of the recent history of observation along with the state-process
that carries long-term information, which is not addressed in either SSM or DNN
solutions. We argue that D4 can be a powerful tool for the analysis of
high-dimensional time-series data.

manual debugging efforts, which plays a vital role in improving software
reliability and development productivity. Recent APR works have achieved
remarkable progress via applying deep learning (DL), particularly neural
machine translation (NMT) techniques. However, we observe that existing
DL-based APR models suffer from at least two severe drawbacks: (1) Most of them
can only generate patches for a single programming language, as a result, to
repair multiple languages, we have to build and train many repairing models.
(2) Most of them are developed in an offline manner. Therefore, they won't
function when there are new-coming requirements. To address the above problems,
a T5-based APR framework equipped with continual learning ability across
multiple programming languages is proposed, namely \emph{C}ont\emph{I}nual
\emph{R}epair a\emph{C}ross Programming \emph{L}anguag\emph{E}s
(\emph{CIRCLE}). Specifically, (1) CIRCLE utilizes a prompting function to
narrow the gap between natural language processing (NLP) pre-trained tasks and
APR. (2) CIRCLE adopts a difficulty-based rehearsal strategy to achieve
lifelong learning for APR without access to the full historical data. (3) An
elastic regularization method is employed to strengthen CIRCLE's continual
learning ability further, preventing it from catastrophic forgetting. (4)
CIRCLE applies a simple but effective re-repairing method to revise generated
errors caused by crossing multiple programming languages. We train CIRCLE for
four languages (i.e., C, JAVA, JavaScript, and Python) and evaluate it on five
commonly used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that CIRCLE not
only effectively and efficiently repairs multiple programming languages in
continual learning settings, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a single repair model.

model that incorporates the effect of both wobbling and hardware impairments,
where the former is caused by random physical fluctuations of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), and the latter by intrinsic radio frequency (RF) nonidealities
at both the transmitter and receiver, such as phase noise, in-phase/quadrature
(I/Q) imbalance, and power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. The impact of UAV
wobbling is modeled by two stochastic processes, i.e., the canonical Wiener
process and the more realistic sinusoidal process. On the other hand, the
\textit{aggregate} impact of all hardware impairments is modeled as two
multiplicative and additive distortion noise processes, which is a
well-accepted model. For the sake of generality, we consider both wide-sense
stationary (WSS) and nonstationary processes for the distortion noises. We then
rigorously characterize the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the wireless
channel, using which we provide a comprehensive analysis of four key
channel-related metrics: (i) power delay profile (PDP), (ii) coherence time,
(iii) coherence bandwidth, and (iv) power spectral density (PSD) of the
distortion-plus-noise process. Furthermore, we evaluate these metrics with
reasonable UAV wobbling and hardware impairment models to obtain useful
insights. Quite noticeably, we demonstrate that even for small UAV wobbling,
the coherence time severely degrades at high frequencies, which renders
air-to-ground channel estimation very difficult at these frequencies. To the
best of our understanding, this is the first work that characterizes the joint
impact of UAV wobbling and hardware impairments on the air-to-ground wireless
channel.

conditions for a Venus-like exoplanet orbiting the M-dwarf type star GJ 436 by
varying the star/planet distance and considering the resultant effects on
heating/cooling and dynamics. The simulation includes the middle and upper
atmosphere (<40 mbar). Overall, these model comparisons reveal that the impact
of extreme ultraviolet to ultraviolet (EUV-UV) heating on the energy balance
shows both radiative and dynamical processes are responsible for driving
significant variations in zonal winds and global temperature profiles at <
10$^{-5}$ mbar. More specifically, CO$_{2}$ 15-${\mu}$m cooling balances EUV/UV
and Near InfraRed (NIR) heating at altitudes below 10$^{-7}$ mbar pressure with
a strong maximum balance for pressures at ~10$^{-5}$ mbar, thus explaining the
invariance of the temperature distribution at altitudes below 10$^{-5}$mbar
pressure for all cases. Our model comparisons also show that moderate changes
in NIR heating result in relatively small changes in neutral temperature in the
upper atmosphere, and virtually no change in the middle atmosphere. However,
with larger changes in the NIR heating profile, much greater changes in neutral
temperature occur in the entire upper and middle atmosphere studied.

numerous untrusted entities into different stages of a device's lifecycle. To
make matters worse, the increase complexity in the design as well as aggressive

lead either designers to unintentionally introduce security vulnerabilities or
verification engineers to fail in detecting them earlier in the design

malicious entities in subsequent stages of the lifecycle through an ever
widening variety of hardware attacks. The ability to ascertain the provenance
of these vulnerabilities, therefore, becomes a pressing issue when the security
assurance across the whole lifecycle is required to be ensured. We posit that
if there is a malicious or unintentional breach of security policies of a
device, it will be reflected in the form of anomalies in the traditional
design, verification and testing activities throughout the lifecycle. With
that, a digital simulacrum of a device's lifecycle, called a digital twin (DT),
can be formed by the data gathered from different stages to secure the
lifecycle of the device. In this paper, we put forward a realization of
intertwined relationships of security vulnerabilities with data available from
the silicon lifecycle and formulate different components of an AI driven DT

relational learning to achieve Forward and Backward Trust Analysis
functionalities enabling security aware management of the entire lifecycle.
Finally, we provide potential future research avenues and challenges for

While filedata can be
encrypted, the revealed file activities can leak secrets. To hide the file
activities from the filesystem and its OS, we propose Enigma, a deception-based
defense injecting sybil file activities as the cover of the actual file
activities.
  Enigma contributes three new designs. (1) To make the deception credible, the
TEE generates sybil calls by replaying file calls from the TEE code under
protection. (2) To make sybil activities cheap, the TEE requests the OS to run
K filesystem images simultaneously. Concealing the disk, the TEE backs only one
image with the actual disk while backing other images by only storing their
metadata. (3) To protect filesystem image identities, the TEE shuffles the
images frequently, preventing the OS from observing any image for long.
  Enigma works with unmodified filesystems shipped withLinux. On a low-cost Arm
SoC with EXT4 and F2FS, our system can concurrently run as many as 50
filesystem images with 1% of disk overhead per additional image. Compared to
common obfuscation for hiding addresses in a flat space, Enigma hides file
activities with richer semantics. Its cost is lower by one order of magnitude

this purpose, we train a set of neural weather models (NWMs) with convolutional

are trained using the ERA5 reanalysis product and a set of candidate loss
functions, including the mean squared error and exponential losses targeting
extremes. We find that training models to minimize custom losses tailored to
emphasize extremes leads to significant skill improvements in the heat wave
prediction task, compared to NWMs trained on the mean squared error loss. This
improvement is accomplished with almost no skill reduction in the general
temperature prediction task, and it can be efficiently realized through
transfer learning, by re-training NWMs with the custom losses for a few epochs.
In addition, we find that the use of a symmetric exponential loss reduces the
smoothing of NWM forecasts with lead time. Our best NWM is able to outperform
persistence in a regressive sense for all lead times and temperature anomaly
thresholds considered, and shows positive regressive skill compared to the

ligament in shear flow and investigate the effects of air-liquid shear on the
growth rate of the ligament interface, breakup time, and droplet diameter
formed by the breakup. The ligament is stretched in the flow direction by the
shearing of airflow. Furthermore, as the influence of the shear flow increases,
the ligament becomes deformed into a liquid sheet, and a perforation forms at
the center of the liquid sheet. The liquid sheet breaks up due to the growth of
the perforation and contracts under the influence of surface tension, forming
two ligaments with diameters smaller than that of the original ligament. The
shearing of the airflow causes the original ligament to elongate, and the
cross-section of the ligament becomes elliptical, which increases instability.
As a result, the growth rate of the ligament exceeds the theoretical value, and
increases with increasing wavenumber of the initial disturbance. Therefore, the
diameter of the formed droplets in shear flow decreases due to the increase in
the wavenumber that governs the breakup of the ligament, and because the growth
rate increases, the breakup time for the ligament decreases. As the velocity
difference of the shear flow increases, constrictions of the ligament form
earlier and the diameter of the satellite droplet increases. As the diameter of
the satellite droplet increases and that of the main droplet decreases, the
dispersion of the droplet diameter decreases, making the diameter uniform.

co-occurrence may overlook discriminative features of the target itself and
lead to model overfitting, thus undermining the performance. In this study, we
propose a generic framework named Parallel Self-Distillation (PSD) for boosting

sub-tasks via two elaborated complementary task decomposition strategies named
Co-occurrence Graph Partition (CGP) and Dis-occurrence Graph Partition (DGP).
Then, the MLIC models of fewer categories are trained with these sub-tasks in
parallel for respectively learning the joint patterns and the category-specific
patterns of labels. Finally, knowledge distillation is leveraged to learn a
compact global ensemble of full categories with these learned patterns for
reconciling the label correlation exploitation and model overfitting. Extensive
results on MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that our framework can be
easily plugged into many MLIC approaches and improve performances of recent
state-of-the-art approaches. The explainable visual study also further
validates that our method is able to learn both the category-specific and
co-occurring features. The source code is released at

decades. Most of them have quantum numbers that can be formed by a pair of
charm and anticharm quarks, thus it is difficult to unambiguously identify the
exotic ones among them. In this Letter, by exploiting heavy quark spin
symmetry, we present a robust prediction of the hadronic molecular scenario,
where the $\psi(4230),\psi(4360)$ and $\psi(4415)$ are identified as $D\bar
D_1,D^*\bar D_1$ and $D^*\bar D^*_2$ bound states, respectively. We show that a
flavor-neutral charmonium-like exotic state with quantum numbers
$J^{PC}=0^{--}$, denoted as $\psi_0(4360)$, should exist as a $D^*\bar D_1$
bound state. The mass and width of the $\psi_0(4360)$} are predicted to be
$(4366\pm18)$ MeV and less than 10 MeV, respectively. The $\psi_0(4360)$ is
significant in two folds: no $0^{--}$ hadron has been observed so far, and a
study of this state will enlighten the understanding of the mysterious vector
mesons between 4.2 and 4.5 GeV, as well as the nature of previously observed
exotic $Z_c$ and $P_c$ states. We propose that such an exotic state can be
searched for in $e^+e^-\to \eta \psi_0(4360)$ and uniquely identified by
measuring the angular distribution of the outgoing $\eta$ meson.

develop a data-driven model using flight records of three different types of

prediction, were chosen as base-models, and a linear regression model was used
as the meta-model. The established stacking model can accurately estimate the

80%. Our model outperforms the existing models in two aspects: firstly, our

reasoning process is time-consuming, tedious, and potentially error-prone. In
this paper we present PIXAL, a visual analytics system developed following an

analysts to reason with and make sense of anomalies. PIXAL consists of three
components: (1) an algorithm that finds patterns by aggregating multiple
anomalous data points using first-order predicates, (2) a visualization tool
that allows the analyst to build trust in the algorithmically-generated
predicates by performing comparative and counterfactual analyses, and (3) a
visualization tool that helps the analyst generate and validate hypotheses by
exploring which features in the data most explain the anomalies. Finally, we

there are challenges in the computational overhead and memory footprint of
sparse training when compressing large-scale language models. To address this
problem, we propose a Parameter-efficient Sparse Training (PST) method to
reduce the number of trainable parameters during sparse-aware training in
downstream tasks. Specifically, we first combine the data-free and data-driven
criteria to efficiently and accurately measure the importance of weights. Then
we investigate the intrinsic redundancy of data-driven weight importance and
derive two obvious characteristics i.e., low-rankness and structuredness. Based
on that, two groups of small matrices are introduced to compute the data-driven
importance of weights, instead of using the original large importance score
matrix, which therefore makes the sparse training resource-efficient and
parameter-efficient. Experiments with diverse networks (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa and
GPT-2) on dozens of datasets demonstrate PST performs on par or better than
previous sparsity methods, despite only training a small number of parameters.
For instance, compared with previous sparsity methods, our PST only requires
1.5% trainable parameters to achieve comparable performance on BERT.

contrast to the dark soliton with only the second-order dispersion and
self-phase modulation, which admits a one-to-one match between the velocity and
phase jump. We further uncover the different topological vector potentials
underlying the distinct phase jumps. The relations between phase jump and
velocity of the SVDS can explain the generation of the previously reported
double-valley dark soliton (DVDS). The detailed analysis on the two phase jumps
characters of the DVDS with one identical velocity enables us to obtain
U-shaped type or double-step type phase distribution. We further explore
collision properties of the DVDSs by analyzing their topological phase, which
can be considered as the generalization of topological phase (Phys. Rev. E 103,

based on a naturalistic multimodal driving dataset, we analyze the visual
scenes of driving in the vicinity of abrupt increases in drivers HR for the

by repeated application of the function $\frac{x+y+1}{2}$. Erickson, Nivasch,
and Xu showed that $\mathcal F$ is well ordered, with order type
$\varepsilon_0$. They also investigated a recursively defined function $M\colon
\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$. They showed that the set of points of discontinuity
of $M$ is a subset of $\mathcal F$ of order type $\varepsilon_0$. They also
showed that, although $M$ is a total function on $\mathbb R$, the fact that the
restriction of $M$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ is total is not provable in first-order
Peano arithmetic $\mathsf{PA}$.
  In this paper we explore the problem (raised by Friedman) of whether similar
approaches can yield well-ordered sets $\mathcal F$ of larger order types. As
Friedman pointed out, Kruskal's tree theorem yields an upper bound of the small
Veblen ordinal for the order type of any set generated in a similar way by
repeated application of a monotone function $g:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R$.
  The most straightforward generalization of $\frac{x+y+1}{2}$ to an $n$-ary
function is the function $\frac{x_1+\cdots+x_n+1}{n}$. We show that this
function generates a set $\mathcal F_n$ whose order type is just
$\varphi_{n-1}(0)$. For this, we develop recursively defined functions
$M_n\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ naturally generalizing the function $M$.
  Furthermore, we prove that for any linear function $g:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb
R$, the order type of the resulting $\mathcal F$ is at most $\varphi_{n-1}(0)$.
  Finally, we show that there do exist continuous functions $g:\mathbb
R^n\to\mathbb R$ for which the order types of the resulting sets $\mathcal F$
approach the small Veblen ordinal.

assumes the demonstrations are samples from an optimal policy, an unrealistic
assumption in practice. When demonstrations are generated by sub-optimal
policies or have sparse state-action pairs, policy learned from sub-optimal
demonstrations may mislead an agent with incorrect or non-local action
decisions. We propose a new method called Local Ensemble and Reparameterization
with Split and Merge of expert policies (LEARN-SAM) to improve efficiency and
make better use of the sub-optimal demonstrations. First, LEARN-SAM employs a
new concept, the lambda-function, based on a discrepancy measure between the
current state to demonstrated states to ""localize"" the weights of the expert
policies during learning. Second, LEARN-SAM employs a split-and-merge (SAM)
mechanism by separating the helpful parts in each expert demonstration and
regrouping them into new expert policies to use the demonstrations selectively.
Both the lambda-function and SAM mechanism help boost the learning speed.
Theoretically, we prove the invariant property of reparameterized policy before
and after the SAM mechanism, providing theoretical guarantees for the
convergence of the employed policy gradient method. We demonstrate the
superiority of the LEARN-SAM method and its robustness with varying
demonstration quality and sparsity in six experiments on complex continuous
control problems of low to high dimensions, compared to existing methods on RL
from demonstration.

quantum adversary generates a quantum state as a pirate software that
potentially removes an embedded message from a classical marked software.
Extracting an embedded message from quantum pirate software is difficult since
measurement could irreversibly alter the quantum state.
  In this work, we define secure watermarking PRFs for quantum adversaries
(unremovability against quantum adversaries). We also present two watermarking
PRFs as follows.
  - We construct a privately extractable watermarking PRF against quantum
adversaries from the quantum hardness of the learning with errors (LWE)
problem. The marking and extraction algorithms use a public parameter and a
private extraction key, respectively. The watermarking PRF is unremovable even
if adversaries have (the public parameter and) access to the extraction oracle,
which returns a result of extraction for a queried quantum circuit.
  - We construct a publicly extractable watermarking PRF against quantum
adversaries from indistinguishability obfuscation (IO) and the quantum hardness
of the LWE problem. The marking and extraction algorithms use a public
parameter and a public extraction key, respectively. The watermarking PRF is
unremovable even if adversaries have the extraction key (and the public
parameter).
  We develop a quantum extraction technique to extract information (a classical
string) from a quantum state without destroying the state too much. We also
introduce the notion of extraction-less watermarking PRFs as a crucial building
block to achieve the results above by combining the tool with our quantum
extraction technique.

(ii) $0<b\leq 1-\frac{\alpha}{n}$, for small initial value and small birth

unified representation, under which the synchronization of departure time is
equivalent to the management of time-window overlapping. Based on this
observation, a time-window-overlapping induced mixed-integer linear program
formulation has been established which is equivalent to the continuous-time
formulation established in the previous work. By imposing an adaptive
time-discretization procedure, we can further reformulate the time coordination
problem using a vehicle-to-time-bucket assignment induced mixed-integer linear
program. Compared to the continuous-time formulation, the assignment
formulation is free of big-M coefficients, and it is demonstrated by numerical
experiments that the assignment formulation is indeed more effective in
computational performance. As an independent interest, three approximation
algorithms have been derived with provable competitive ratios under a certain
regularity assumptions, which is for the first time on this discrete
optimization problem. The solution approach has been extended to general cases
in which the graph formed by vehicle routes can have loops, by adding a
systematic loop breaking scheme. An insightful discovery is that whether there
exists an exact equivalent assignment formulation for a general problem

architecture and high-performance synchronous training upon all-reduce (AR)
architecture are the most commonly deployed distributed training modes for
recommendation models. Although synchronous AR training is designed to have
higher training efficiency, asynchronous PS training would be a better choice
for training speed when there are stragglers (slow workers) in the shared
cluster, especially under limited computing resources. An ideal way to take
full advantage of these two training modes is to switch between them upon the
cluster status. However, switching training modes often requires tuning
hyper-parameters, which is extremely time- and resource-consuming. We find two
obstacles to a tuning-free approach: the different distribution of the gradient
values and the stale gradients from the stragglers. This paper proposes Global
Batch gradients Aggregation (GBA) over PS, which aggregates and applies
gradients with the same global batch size as the synchronous training. A
token-control process is implemented to assemble the gradients and decay the
gradients with severe staleness. We provide the convergence analysis to reveal
that GBA has comparable convergence properties with the synchronous training,
and demonstrate the robustness of GBA the recommendation models against the
gradient staleness. Experiments on three industrial-scale recommendation tasks
show that GBA is an effective tuning-free approach for switching. Compared to
the state-of-the-art derived asynchronous training, GBA achieves up to 0.2%
improvement on the AUC metric, which is significant for the recommendation
models. Meanwhile, under the strained hardware resource, GBA speeds up at least
2.4x compared to synchronous training.

absorption abilities of grain boundaries (GBs) to interstitials (I) and
vacancies (V)), is proposed to characterize the radiation tolerance of
materials with different grain sizes. Low absorption bias promotes defects
annihilation through enhancing I-V recombination and optimally tuning its
competition with GB absorption. Thus, the lower absorption bias, the higher
anti-irradiation performance of NC BCC metals is. Furthermore, by
comprehensively considering the mechanical property, thermal stability and
radiation resistance, nano-crystals are recommended for Fe-based structural

high-entropy alloys containing three or more components in high concentrations,
render a tunable chemical short-range order (SRO). Leveraging large-scale
atomistic simulations, we probe the limit of Hall-Petch strengthening and
deformation mechanisms in a model CrCoNi alloy and unravel chemical short-range
ordering effects. It is found that, in the presence of SRO, the maximum
strength is appreciably increased, and the strongest grain size drifts to a
small value. Additionally, the propensity for faulting and deformation
transformation is reduced and accompanied by the intensification of planar slip
and strain localization. We reveal strikingly different deformation
microstructures and dislocation patterns that prominently depend on
crystallographic grain orientation and the number of slip planes activated
during deformation. Grain of single planar slip attains the highest volume
fraction of deformation-induced structure transformation, and grain with double
active slip planes develops the densest dislocation network. These results
advancing the fundamental understanding of deformation mechanisms and
dislocation patterning in MPEAs suggest a mechanistic strategy for tuning
mechanical behavior through simultaneously tailoring grain texture and local
chemical order.

area of the concurrence triangle satisfying all genuine multipartite

tripartite measures. Here, we focus on using concurrence fill to quantify the
tripartite entanglement in three-flavor NOs. Concurrence fill can reach its
maximum $0.89$ for the experimentally-observed electron antineutrino

stellar evolution code MESA to follow the response of main sequence stars of

CCSN ejecta with the main sequence star deposits energy and inflate the main
sequence star. If the binary system stays bound after the CCSN explosion the
inflated main sequence star might engulf the newly born neutron star (NS). We
assume that the NS accretes mass through an accretion disk and launches jets.
The jets remove mass from the inflated main sequence star and collide with the
CCSN ejecta. Although this scenario is rare, it adds up to other rare scenarios
to further support the notion that many stripped envelope CCSNe are powered by
late jets. The late jets can power these CCSNe-I for a long time and might
power bumps in their lightcurve. The jets might also shape the inner ejecta to
a bipolar morphology. Our results further support suggestions that there are
several ways to feed a NS (or a black hole) to launch the late jets in

segmentation, allowing complex objects to be segmented from the background for
further analysis. Existing models can be divided into region-based active
contour models and edge-based active contour models. However, both models use
direct image data to achieve segmentation and face many challenging problems in
terms of the initial contour position, noise sensitivity, local minima and
inefficiency owing to the in-homogeneity of image intensities. The saliency map
of an image changes the image representation, making it more visual and
meaningful. In this study, we propose a novel model that uses the advantages of
a saliency map with local image information (LIF) and overcomes the drawbacks
of previous models. The proposed model is driven by a saliency map of an image
and the local image information to enhance the progress of the active contour
models. In this model, the saliency map of an image is first computed to find
the saliency driven local fitting energy. Then, the saliency-driven local
fitting energy is combined with the LIF model, resulting in a final novel
energy functional. This final energy functional is formulated through a level
set formulation, and regulation terms are added to evolve the contour more
precisely across the object boundaries. The quality of the proposed method was
verified on different synthetic images, real images and publicly available
datasets, including medical images. The image segmentation results, and
quantitative comparisons confirmed the contour initialization independence,
noise insensitivity, and superior segmentation accuracy of the proposed model
in comparison to the other segmentation models.

improved flexibility to the charging process among the devices as they can
maintain their mobility while replenishing their battery. Few existing works in
P2P-WET unrealistically assume the nodes to be exchanging energy at every
opportunity with any other node. Also, energy exchange between the nodes is not
bounded by the energy transfer limit in that inter-node meeting duration. In
this regard, the parametric heterogeneity (in terms of device's battery
capacity and WET hardware) among the nodes also affects the energy transfer
bound in each P2P interaction, and thus, may lead to unbalanced network energy
distributions. This inherent heterogeneity aspect has not been adequately
covered in the P2P-WET literature so far, especially from the point of view of
maintaining a balanced energy distribution in the networked population. In this

$\phi$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ at mid-rapidity ($|y|<$1) in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 54.4 GeV measured by the STAR detector.
The $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ are measured as a function of transverse momentum and
centrality. Their energy dependence is also studied. $v_{3}$ is found to be
more sensitive to the change in the center-of-mass energy than $v_{2}$. Scaling
by constituent quark number is found to hold for $v_{2}$ within 10%. This
observation could be evidence for the development of partonic collectivity in
54.4 GeV Au+Au collisions. Differences in $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ between baryons
and anti-baryons are presented, and ratios of $v_{3}$/$v_{2}^{3/2}$ are studied
and motivated by hydrodynamical calculations. The ratio of $v_{2}$ of $\phi$
mesons to that of anti-protons ($v_{2}(\phi)/v_{2}(\bar{p})$) shows centrality
dependence at low transverse momentum, presumably resulting from the larger
effects from hadronic interactions on anti-proton $v_{2}$.

the charging process. Moreover, we investigate different approaches to realize
optimal work extraction without wasted energy. Among them a central-spin

charging time $\propto 1/N_c$, large extractable work, and
$\sqrt{N_c}$-improvement of charging power compared with the battery in the

approximate the maximum likelihood estimation of the location-scale Gaussian
mixtures. However, when the models are over-specified, namely, the chosen
number of components to fit the data is larger than the unknown true number of
components, EM needs a polynomial number of iterations in terms of the sample
size to reach the final statistical radius; this is computationally expensive
in practice. The slow convergence of EM is due to the missing of the locally
strong convexity with respect to the location parameter on the negative
population log-likelihood function, i.e., the limit of the negative sample
log-likelihood function when the sample size goes to infinity. To efficiently
explore the curvature of the negative log-likelihood functions, by specifically
considering two-component location-scale Gaussian mixtures, we develop the
Exponential Location Update (ELU) algorithm. The idea of the ELU algorithm is
that we first obtain the exact optimal solution for the scale parameter and
then perform an exponential step-size gradient descent for the location
parameter. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the ELU iterates
converge to the final statistical radius of the models after a logarithmic
number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge, it resolves the
long-standing open question in the literature about developing an optimization
algorithm that has optimal statistical and computational complexities for
solving parameter estimation even under some specific settings of the
over-specified Gaussian mixture models.

Most of the work has focused on improving performance on benchmark datasets,

In this paper, we investigate the backbone networks (e.g. CNNs, Transformers,

estimation. We first evaluate state-of-the-art models on diverse public
datasets, which have never been seen during the network training. Next, we
investigate the effects of texture-biased and shape-biased representations

Transformers exhibit a strong shape bias and CNNs do a strong texture-bias. We
also find that shape-biased models show better generalization performance for
monocular depth estimation compared to texture-biased models. Based on these
observations, we newly design a CNN-Transformer hybrid network with a
multi-level adaptive feature fusion module, called MonoFormer. The design
intuition behind MonoFormer is to increase shape bias by employing Transformers
while compensating for the weak locality bias of Transformers by adaptively
fusing multi-level representations. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with various public

symbionts is phylogenetic tree reconciliation. A crucial issue in this method
is that from a biological point of view, reasonable cost values for an
event-based parsimonious reconciliation are not easily chosen. Different
approaches have been developed to infer such cost values for a given pair of
host and symbiont trees. However, a major limitation of these approaches is
their inability to model the invasion of different host species by a same
symbiont species (referred to as a spread event), which is thought to happen in
symbiotic relations. To mention one example, the same species of insects may
pollinate different species of plants. This results in multiple associations
observed between the symbionts and their hosts (meaning that a symbiont is no
longer specific to a host), that are not compatible with the current methods of
coevolution.In this paper, we propose a method, called AmoCoala (a more
realistic version of a previous tool called Coala) which for a given pair of
host and symbiont trees, estimates the probabilities of the cophylogeny events,
in presence of spread events, relying on an approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC) approach. The algorithm that we propose, by including spread events,
enables the multiple associations to be taken into account in a more accurate
way, inducing more confidence in the estimated sets of costs and thus in the
reconciliation of a given pair of host and symbiont trees. Its rooting in the
tool Coala allows it to estimate the probabilities of the events even in the
case of large datasets. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real datasets.

(fields). It may have long-range properties, be altered, and even undergo phase
transitions. It is suggested that long-range properties of a quantum vacuum may
be probed by distributing matter over a large spatial volume. Here, we study a
simplest example of such, i.e., two uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt
detectors which are spatially separated, and examine the inter-detector
interaction energy arising from the coupling between the detectors and
fluctuating fields to see if novel phenomena related to the long-range
properties emerge of a vacuum altered by uniformly accelerating two spatially
separated detectors through it. Our results show that when the inter-detector
separation is much larger than the thermal wavelength of the Unruh thermal
bath, the inter-detector interaction displays a completely new behavior, which,
as compared with that of the inertial detectors, is surprisingly exclusively
acceleration-dependent, signaling a new phase of the vacuum in which its
imprint as seen by two inertial observers seems to be completely wiped out.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-detector interaction in the near region
can be significantly enhanced by the accelerated motion in certain
circumstances, and with two Rydberg atoms as the detectors, the acceleration
required for an experimentally detectable enhancement of the interaction energy
can be $10^5$ times smaller than that required for the detection of the Unruh

techniques of bitwise logic-in-memory operations and dot product operations,
this paper extends the CiM paradigm with FAST, a new shift-based inmemory
computation technique to handle high-concurrency operations on multiple rows in
an SRAM. Such high-concurrency operations are widely seen in both conventional
applications (e.g. the table update in a database), and emerging applications
(e.g. the parallel weight update in neural network accelerators), in which low
latency and low energy consumption are critical. The proposed shift-based CiM
architecture is enabled by integrating the shifter function into each SRAM
cell, and by creating a datapath that exploits the high-parallelism of shifting
operations in multiple rows in the array. A 128-row 16-column shiftable SRAM in
65nm CMOS is designed to evaluate the proposed architecture. Postlayout SPICE
simulations show average improvements of 4.4x energy efficiency and 96.0x speed

performing the 8-bit weight update task in a VGG-7 framework.

then apply this method to YSOs in the Serpens Molecular Cloud to estimate ages
of optical members previously identified from Gaia DR2 astrometry data. The
optical members in Serpens are concentrated in different subgroups with ages

FaceMAE, where the face privacy and recognition performance are considered
simultaneously. Firstly, randomly masked face images are used to train the
reconstruction module in FaceMAE. We tailor the instance relation matching
(IRM) module to minimize the distribution gap between real faces and FaceMAE
reconstructed ones. During the deployment phase, we use trained FaceMAE to
reconstruct images from masked faces of unseen identities without extra

between reconstructed and original datasets. Experiments prove that the
identities of reconstructed images are difficult to be retrieved. We also
perform sufficient privacy-preserving face recognition on several public face

driving explosive dynamics and heating, but relatively little is known about
how it develops in partially ionised plasmas (PIP) of the solar chromosphere.
Partial ionisation might largely alter the dynamics of the coalescence
instability, which promotes fast reconnection and forms a turbulent
reconnecting current sheet through plasmoid interaction, but it is still
unclear to what extent PIP effects influence this process. We investigate the
role of collisional ionisation and recombination in the development of plasmoid
coalescence in PIP through 2.5D simulations of a two-fluid model. The aim is to
understand whether these two-fluid coupling processes play a role in
accelerating reconnection. We find that in general ionisation-recombination
process slow down the coalescence. Unlike the previous models in G. Murtas, A.
Hillier \& B. Snow, Physics of Plasmas 28, 032901 (2021) that included thermal
collisions only, ionisation and recombination stabilise current sheets and
suppress non-linear dynamics, with turbulent reconnection occurring in limited
cases: bursts of ionisation lead to the formation of thicker current sheets,
even when radiative losses are included to cool the system. Therefore, the
coalescence time scale is very sensitive to ionisation-recombination processes.
However, reconnection in PIP is still faster than in a fully ionised plasma
environment having the same bulk density: the PIP reconnection rate
($M_{_{\operatorname{IRIP}}} = 0.057$) increases by a factor of $\sim 1.2$ with
respect to the MHD reconnection rate ($M_{_{\operatorname{MHD}}} = 0.047$).

single slices in the feature normalization. Our methods were validated using

boosted their usage in real-world applications such as self-driving cars and

for not only accurate but also efficient 3D object detection. Recently,
knowledge distillation has been proposed as an effective model compression
technique, which transfers the knowledge from an over-parameterized teacher to
a lightweight student and achieves consistent effectiveness in 2D vision.
However, due to point clouds' sparsity and irregularity, directly applying
previous image-based knowledge distillation methods to point cloud detectors
usually leads to unsatisfactory performance. To fill the gap, this paper
proposes PointDistiller, a structured knowledge distillation framework for
point clouds-based 3D detection. Concretely, PointDistiller includes local
distillation which extracts and distills the local geometric structure of point
clouds with dynamic graph convolution and reweighted learning strategy, which
highlights student learning on the crucial points or voxels to improve
knowledge distillation efficiency. Extensive experiments on both voxels-based
and raw points-based detectors have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
method over seven previous knowledge distillation methods. For instance, our 4X
compressed PointPillars student achieves 2.8 and 3.4 mAP improvements on BEV

of these models on downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner, recent works explore
generating fixed or learnable prompts, i.e., classification weights are
synthesized from natural language describing task-relevant categories, to
reduce the gap between tasks in the training and test phases. However, how and
what prompts can improve inference performance remains unclear. In this paper,
we explicitly provide exploration and clarify the importance of including
semantic information in prompts, while existing prompt methods generate prompts
without exploring the semantic information of textual labels. A challenging
issue is that manually constructing prompts, with rich semantic information,
requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To this end, we
propose Causality-pruning Knowledge Prompt (CapKP) for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models to downstream image recognition. CapKP retrieves an
ontological knowledge graph by treating the textual label as a query to explore
task-relevant semantic information. To further refine the derived semantic
information, CapKP introduces causality-pruning by following the first
principle of Granger causality. Empirically, we conduct extensive evaluations
to demonstrate the effectiveness of CapKP, e.g., with 8 shots, CapKP
outperforms the manual-prompt method by 12.51% and the learnable-prompt method
by 1.39% on average, respectively. Experimental analyses prove the superiority
of CapKP in domain generalization compared to benchmark approaches.

learning fast approximations of the strong branching expert. In this work, we
instead propose to learn branching rules from scratch via Reinforcement

Markov Decision Processes, or tree MDPs, a generalization of temporal MDPs that
provides a more suitable framework for learning to branch. We derive a tree
policy gradient theorem, which exhibits a better credit assignment compared to
its temporal counterpart. We demonstrate through computational experiments that
tree MDPs improve the learning convergence, and offer a promising framework for
tackling the learning-to-branch problem in MILPs.

caused by bacteria, fungi, and other organisms. These diseases affect plants'
health severely and lead to significant crop loss. Most of these diseases can
be identified by regularly observing the leaves and stems under expert
supervision. In a country with vast agricultural regions and limited crop
protection experts, manual identification of paddy diseases is challenging.
Thus, to add a solution to this problem, it is necessary to automate the
disease identification process and provide easily accessible decision support
tools to enable effective crop protection measures. However, the lack of
availability of public datasets with detailed disease information limits the
practical implementation of accurate disease detection systems. This paper
presents \emph{Paddy Doctor}, a visual image dataset for identifying paddy
diseases. Our dataset contains 16,225 annotated paddy leaf images across 13
classes (12 diseases and normal leaf). We benchmarked the \emph{Paddy Doctor}

shattering of one star's crust prior to coalescence. Seismic aftershocks and
low-frequency torsional modes may emanate from the rupture site in this case,
explaining the underlying oscillations. This interpretation is directly
analogous to proposals for giant flares from soft gamma repeaters, where
oscillations at similar frequencies have been observed, involving starquakes
followed by crustal vibrations. Torsional mode properties were computed for

The $\approx 22\, \mbox{Hz}$ modulations in the precursor matches that of

translation when there is little to no parallel data. In this approach, a
source-to-target model is coupled with a target-to-source model trained in
parallel. The target-to-source model generates noisy sources, while the
source-to-target model is trained to reconstruct the targets and vice versa.
Recent developments of multilingual pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models for
programming languages have been very effective for a broad spectrum of
downstream software engineering tasks. Hence, training them to build
programming language translation systems via back-translation is compelling.
However, these models cannot be further trained via back-translation since they
learn to output sequences in the same language as the inputs during
pre-training. As an alternative, we propose performing back-translation via
code summarization and generation. In code summarization, a model learns to
generate natural language (NL) summaries given code snippets. In code
generation, the model learns to do the opposite. Therefore, target-to-source
generation in back-translation can be viewed as a target-to-NL-to-source
generation. We show that our proposed approach performs competitively with
state-of-the-art methods. We have made the code publicly available.

entanglement of liquid states of quantum matter that arise in systems of

violation of the area-law in real-space entanglement entropy of a subsystem (of
length $L$), $S_{EE} \sim L^{D-1}\ln L$, widely believed to be a hallmark
signature of the ground state of a gapless quantum critical system of
interacting fermions. In this work, we apply a $T=0$ renormalisation group
approach to a prototype of the FL in momentum (or, $k$)-space, unveiling
thereby the RG relevant quantum fluctuations (due to forward and tangential
scattering) from which long-range entanglement arises. A similar analysis of
non-Fermi liquids such as the 2D marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) and the 1D
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) reveals a universal logarithmic violation of
the area-law in gapless electronic liquids for a subsystem defined within a
$k$-space window (of size $\Lambda$) proximate to the Fermi surface, with a
proportionality constant that depends on the nature of the underlying Fermi
surface. We extend this analysis to the gapped quantum liquids emergent from
the destabilisation of the Fermi surface by quantum fluctuations arising from
backscattering processes. Indeed, we find that the $k$-space entanglement
signatures of gapped quantum liquids appear to be governed by the nature of the
Fermi surface (e.g., nested or not) from which they emerge, as well as the
nature of their parent gapless metallic liquid (e.g., FL, MFL etc.). This is
confirmed by our finding an enhanced entanglement entropy for the nodal MFL
present at the quantum critical point recently discovered in the 2D Hubbard
model at optimal hole-doping. Our work thus paves the way for an entanglement
based classification of quantum liquids emergent from the criticality of
interacting fermionic matter.

merit for many accelerator applications, such as ultra-fast electron
diffraction, free electron lasers and the operation of new compact accelerator
concepts in general. One of the easiest to implement methods to determine the
transverse emittance is the phase advance scan method using a focusing element
and a screen. This method has been shown to work well in the thermal regime. In
the space charge dominated laminar flow regime, however, the scheme becomes
difficult to apply, because of the lack of a closed description of the beam
envelope including space charge effects. Furthermore, certain mathematical, as
well as beamline design criteria must be met in order to ensure accurate
results. In this work we show that it is possible to analyze phase advance scan
data using a fully connected neural network (FCNN), even in setups, which do
not meet these criteria. In a simulation study, we evaluate the perfomance of
the FCNN by comparing it to a traditional fit routine, based on the beam
envelope equation. Subsequently, we use a pre-trained FCNN to evaluate measured
phase advance scan data, which ultimately yields much better agreement with
numerical simulations. To tackle the confirmation bias problem, we employ
additional mask-based emittance measurement techniques.

labels are known while others are unknown for each image, may greatly reduce
the cost of annotation and thus facilitate large-scale MLR. We find that strong
semantic correlations exist within each image and across different images, and
these correlations can help transfer the knowledge possessed by the known
labels to retrieve the unknown labels and thus improve the performance of the
MLR-PL task (see Figure 1). In this work, we propose a novel heterogeneous
semantic transfer (HST) framework that consists of two complementary transfer
modules that explore both within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to
transfer the knowledge possessed by known labels to generate pseudo labels for
the unknown labels. Specifically, an intra-image semantic transfer (IST) module
learns an image-specific label co-occurrence matrix for each image and maps the
known labels to complement the unknown labels based on these matrices.
Additionally, a cross-image transfer (CST) module learns category-specific
feature-prototype similarities and then helps complement the unknown labels
that have high degrees of similarity with the corresponding prototypes.
Finally, both the known and generated pseudo labels are used to train MLR
models. Extensive experiments conducted on the Microsoft COCO, Visual Genome,
and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets show that the proposed HST framework achieves
superior performance to that of current state-of-the-art algorithms.
Specifically, it obtains mean average precision (mAP) improvements of 1.4%,
3.3%, and 0.4% on the three datasets over the results of the best-performing
previously developed algorithm.

detecting Earth-like exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) method. A
commonly employed solution for addressing stellar activity is to assume a
linear relationship between the RV observations and the activity indicators
along the entire time series, and then remove the estimated contribution of
activity from the variation in RV data (overall correction method). However,
since active regions evolve on the photosphere over time, correlations between
the RV observations and the activity indicators will correspondingly be
anisotropic. We present an approach that recognizes the RV locations where the
correlations between the RV and the activity indicators significantly change in
order to better account for variations in RV caused by stellar activity. The
proposed approach uses a general family of statistical breakpoint methods,
often referred to as change point detection (CPD) algorithms; several
implementations of which are available in R and python. A thorough comparison
is made between the breakpoint-based approach and the overall correction
method. To ensure wide representativity, we use measurements from real stars
that have different levels of stellar activity and whose spectra have different
signal-to-noise ratios. When the corrections for stellar activity are applied
separately to each temporal segment identified by the breakpoint method, the
corresponding residuals in the RV time series are typically much smaller than
those obtained by the overall correction method. Consequently, the generalized
Lomb-Scargle periodogram contains a smaller number of peaks caused by active
regions. The CPD algorithm is particularly effective when focusing on active
stars with long time series, such as alpha Cen B.

Traditional time-series anomaly detection methods capture underlying patterns

The goal of the agent is to learn the optimal policy which is most preferred by
the human overseer. Despite the empirical successes, the theoretical
understanding of preference-based RL (PbRL) is only limited to the tabular
case. In this paper, we propose the first optimistic model-based algorithm for
PbRL with general function approximation, which estimates the model using

network compression methods such as pruning and quantization are proposed to
reduce the model size significantly, of which the key is to find suitable
compression allocation (e.g., pruning sparsity and quantization codebook) of
each layer. Existing solutions obtain the compression allocation in an
iterative/manual fashion while finetuning the compressed model, thus suffering
from the efficiency issue. Different from the prior art, we propose a novel
One-shot Pruning-Quantization (OPQ) in this paper, which analytically solves
the compression allocation with pre-trained weight parameters only. During
finetuning, the compression module is fixed and only weight parameters are
updated. To our knowledge, OPQ is the first work that reveals pre-trained model
is sufficient for solving pruning and quantization simultaneously, without any
complex iterative/manual optimization at the finetuning stage. Furthermore, we
propose a unified channel-wise quantization method that enforces all channels
of each layer to share a common codebook, which leads to low bit-rate
allocation without introducing extra overhead brought by traditional
channel-wise quantization. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet with

parameter, which is unrealistic. To tackle this problem, recent works study KD

generation stage and queries the teacher only once for each sample in the
distillation stage. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show
the effectiveness of the proposed QEKD. For instance, QEKD can improve the
performance of the best baseline method (DFME) by 5.83 on CIFAR10 dataset with
only 0.02x the query budget of DFME.

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models significantly under-perform Auto-regressive
(AR) models on various language generation tasks. Among the NAR models, BANG is
the first large-scale pre-training model on English un-labeled raw text corpus.
It considers different generation paradigms as its pre-training tasks including
Auto-regressive (AR), Non-Autoregressive (NAR), and semi-Non-Autoregressive
(semi-NAR) information flow with multi-stream strategy. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance without any distillation techniques. However, AR
distillation has been shown to be a very effective solution for improving NAR
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced mixed distillation
method to further improve the generation quality of BANG. Firstly, we propose
the mixed distillation strategy based on the AR stream knowledge. Secondly, we
encourage the model to focus on the samples with the same modality by
self-paced learning. The proposed self-paced mixed distillation algorithm
improves the generation quality and has no influence on the inference latency.
We carry out extensive experiments on summarization and question generation
tasks to validate the effectiveness. To further illustrate the commercial value
of our approach, we conduct experiments on three generation tasks in real-world
advertisements applications. Experimental results on commercial data show the
effectiveness of the proposed model. Compared with BANG, it achieves

spatiotemporal structure of agents' decisions and consider the hierarchy of
coordination from the perspective of multilevel emergence dynamics, based on
which a novel approach, Learning to Advise and Learning from Advice (LALA), is
proposed to improve MARL. Specifically, by distinguishing the hierarchy of
coordination, we propose to enhance decision coordination at meso level with an
advisor and leverage a policy discriminator to advise agents' learning at micro
level. The advisor learns to aggregate decision information in both spatial and
temporal domains and generates coordinated decisions by employing a
spatiotemporal dual graph convolutional neural network with a task-oriented
objective function. Each agent learns from the advice via a policy generative
adversarial learning method where a discriminator distinguishes between the
policies of the agent and the advisor and boosts both of them based on its
judgement. Experimental results indicate the advantage of LALA over baseline
approaches in terms of both learning efficiency and coordination capability.
Coordination mechanism is investigated from the perspective of multilevel
emergence dynamics and mutual information point of view, which provides a novel

It is still unknown whether and how discriminative PLMs, e.g., ELECTRA, can be
effectively prompt-tuned. In this work, we present DPT, the first prompt tuning
framework for discriminative PLMs, which reformulates NLP tasks into a
discriminative language modeling problem. Comprehensive experiments on text
classification and question answering show that, compared with vanilla
fine-tuning, DPT achieves significantly higher performance, and also prevents
the unstable problem in tuning large PLMs in both full-set and low-resource
settings. The source code and experiment details of this paper can be obtained

theoretically. We first prove that even spectral GNNs without nonlinearity can

no missing frequency components in node features. We also establish a
connection between the expressive power of spectral GNNs and Graph Isomorphism

weight function corresponds to the graph signal density in the spectrum.
Inspired by the analysis, we propose JacobiConv, which uses Jacobi basis due to
its orthogonality and flexibility to adapt to a wide range of weight functions.
JacobiConv deserts nonlinearity while outperforming all baselines on both

each follower are variable parameters, and therefore, the followers can carry
out various and complex behaviour even without changing the linear and angular
velocities of the leader robot. After proposing the kinematic model of the
time-varying leader-follower formation, the backstepping control method is
exploited to keep the structure of the defined formation. The global stability
of the formation is investigated using the Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, the
designed nonlinear controller suffers from the ineffectual large input commands
at the beginning of the formation. To rectify this problem, a fuzzy adaptive
algorithm is proposed to improve the backstepping controller and the global
stability of the resulting fuzzy adaptive backstepping controller is
guaranteed. Considering the rate change of relative distance and bearing in the
kinematic model of the leader-follower formation and controller design
procedure, makes the formation more practical in dynamic and clutter
environments, as well as capable of defining complicated behaviour for
followers, and provides crash and obstacle avoidance without switching between
different control strategies. Finally, the performance of the proposed
kinematics model and designed controllers are investigated through simulations

much higher spatial separation in the transmit antennas than traditional
satellites with antenna arrays, promising a massive increase in spectral
efficiency. The resulting precoder and equalizer have very low demands on

This is achieved by taking knowledge about the geometry between satellites and

be achieved if the satellites transmit independent data streams. For the
equalizer, the GS requires only knowledge about the angles of arrival (AoAs)
from all satellites. Furthermore, we show that, by choosing a proper
inter-satellite distance, the proposed low-complexity approach achieves the
theoretical upper bound in terms of data rate. This optimal inter-satellite
distance is obtained analytically under simplifying assumption and provides a
heuristic for practical scenarios. Furthermore, a novel approach to increase
the robustness of the proposed precoder and equalizer against imperfect AoD and

runtimes a-priori to conduct efficient scheduling. In heterogeneous cluster
infrastructures, this problem becomes aggravated because these runtimes are
required for each task-node pair. Using historical data is often not feasible
as logs are typically not retained indefinitely and workloads as well as
infrastructure changes. In contrast, online methods, which predict task
runtimes on specific nodes while the workflow is running, have to cope with the
lack of example runs, especially during the start-up.
  In this paper, we present Lotaru, a novel online method for locally
estimating task runtimes in scientific workflows on heterogeneous clusters.
Lotaru first profiles all nodes of a cluster with a set of short-running and
uniform microbenchmarks. Next, it runs the workflow to be scheduled on the
user's local machine with drastically reduced data to determine important task
characteristics. Based on these measurements, Lotaru learns a Bayesian linear
regression model to predict a task's runtime given the input size and finally
adjusts the predicted runtime specifically for each task-node pair in the
cluster based on the micro-benchmark results. Due to its Bayesian approach,
Lotaru can also compute robust uncertainty estimates and provides them as an
input for advanced scheduling methods.
  Our evaluation with five real-world scientific workflows and different

for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star within its habitable zone.
However, the research community remains limited by the presence of stellar
noise produced by stellar magnetic activity. These activity phenomena can
obscure the detection of Earth-mass exoplanets and can create parasitic signals
in transmission spectra. In this paper, we outline the need for a public
forecast of stellar activity, and produce a proof of principle. Using publicly
available spectra we are able to forecast stellar minima several years ahead
and reach a typical uncertainty on the timing of these minima of ~0.5 year,
similar to the precision reached on our own Sun's magnetic cycle. Furthermore,
we use our toy model to show that knowing when to observe can improve the
sensitivity of HARPS-North's Solar telescope to low mass planets by up to an
order of magnitude, and we show that the majority of exoplanets selected for
Early Release Science and Guaranteed Time Observations on the James Webb will
be observed close or during stellar maxima, incurring a higher risk of stellar
contamination. We finish our paper by outlining a number of next steps to
create a public forecast usable by teams around the globe, by telescope time

clinical applications, including image guidance in radiation and surgery.
Half-fan and short-can are the commonly used modes in clinical applications to
expand the imaging volume and reduce radiation exposure. Anatomical structures
are faithfully reconstructed using CBCT while deep information including
material composition is not feasible in its current form. Dual-energy computed
tomography (DECT) is an advanced medical imaging technology with superior
capability of material differentiation by scanning the patient using two
different energy spectra. Conventional DECT systems require expensive and
sophisticated hardware components, significantly limiting DECT applications to
cone-beam CT (CBCT) machines. In this work, we propose a dual-energy cone-beam
CT (DECBCT) system by placing a dedicatedly designed beam modulator in front of
the detector surface to acquire dual-energy projection data in a single scan. A
deep learning-based data restoration model is introduced to generate complete
dual-energy data from the detector-modulated data for DECT image reconstruction
and material decomposition. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated
using an electron density phantom and clinical CT. The mean error for electron
density calculation is lower than 1.16% in the electron density phantom study.
The mean errors for reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) are
lower than 1.41% and 0.89% in the head and pelvis studies, respectively. The
results indicate that the proposed method is a promising solution for
single-scan DECBCT in clinical practice.

We further develop dynamic assumptions which build on the LATE framework and

with a global symmetry, we consider symmetric gapping potentials which are
relevant perturbations to the CFT. If a gapping potential is introduced only in
a subregion of the system, it provides a certain boundary condition to the CFT.
From this equivalence, if there exists a Cardy boundary state which is
invariant under a symmetry, then the CFT can be gapped with a unique ground
state by adding the corresponding gapping potential. This means that the
symmetry of the CFT is anomaly free. Using this approach, we systematically
deduce the anomaly-free conditions for various types of CFTs with several
different symmetries. They include the free compact boson theory,
Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and unitary minimal models. When the symmetry of the

extreme service environment and load factors, bolts often get loose or even

urgent need in practical engineering, which is critical to keep structural
safety and service life. In recent years, many bolt loosening detection methods
using deep learning and machine learning techniques have been proposed and are
attracting more and more attention. However, most of these studies use bolt
images captured in laboratory for deep leaning model training. The images are
obtained in a well-controlled light, distance, and view angle conditions. Also,
the bolted structures are well designed experimental structures with brand new
bolts and the bolts are exposed without any shelter nearby. It is noted that in
practical engineering, the above well controlled lab conditions are not easy
realized and the real bolt images often have blur edges, oblique perspective,
partial occlusion and indistinguishable colors etc., which make the trained
models obtained in laboratory conditions loss their accuracy or fails.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a dataset named NPU-BOLT for
bolt object detection in natural scene images and open it to researchers for
public use and further development. In the first version of the dataset, it
contains 337 samples of bolt joints images mainly in the natural environment,

1275 bolt targets. The bolt targets are annotated into four categories named

labeling, a more effective way is to use active learning (AL) to annotate a
selected subset with specific properties. However, domain adaptation tasks are
always addressed in two interactive aspects: domain transfer and the
enhancement of discrimination, which requires the selected data to be both
uncertain under the model and diverse in feature space. Contrary to active
learning in classification tasks, it is usually challenging to select pixels
that contain both the above properties in segmentation tasks, leading to the
complex design of pixel selection strategy. To address such an issue, we
propose a novel Active Domain Adaptation scheme with Multi-level Contrastive
Units (ADA-MCU) for semantic image segmentation. A simple pixel selection
strategy followed with the construction of multi-level contrastive units is
introduced to optimize the model for both domain adaptation and active
supervised learning. In practice, MCUs are constructed from intra-image,
cross-image, and cross-domain levels by using both labeled and unlabeled

pixel-to-pixel manners, with the aim of jointly aligning the category centers
and reducing outliers near the decision boundaries. In addition, we also
introduce a categories correlation matrix to implicitly describe the
relationship between categories, which are used to adjust the weights of the
losses for MCUs. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks show
that the proposed method achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art SSDA methods with 50% fewer labeled pixels and significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art with a large margin by using the same level of

considering its objective to identify images of the same pedestrian across
cameras at different locations often of variable and independent domain
characteristics that are also subject to view-biased data distribution. In this
work, we propose a Feature-Distribution Perturbation and Calibration (PECA)
method to derive generic feature representations for person ReID, which is not
only discriminative across cameras but also agnostic and deployable to
arbitrary unseen target domains. Specifically, we perform per-domain
feature-distribution perturbation to refrain the model from overfitting to the
domain-biased distribution of each source (seen) domain by enforcing feature
invariance to distribution shifts caused by perturbation. Furthermore, we
design a global calibration mechanism to align feature distributions across all
the source domains to improve the model generalization capacity by eliminating
domain bias. These local perturbation and global calibration are conducted
simultaneously, which share the same principle to avoid models overfitting by
regularization respectively on the perturbed and the original distributions.
Extensive experiments were conducted on eight person ReID datasets and the

massive binary systems, which aims to constrain the internal structure of the
stars. We focus on the binary CPD-41{\deg}7742 and revisit HD152218.
Independent studies of CPD-41{\deg}7742 in the past showed large discrepancies
in the longitude of periastron of the orbit, hinting at the presence of apsidal
motion. We perform a consistent analysis of all observational data, explicitly
accounting for the apsidal motion. We use spectroscopic and photometric
observations of CPD-41{\deg}7742 to infer values for the fundamental stellar
and binary parameters. We apply a disentangling method to the spectra to
simultaneously derive the RVs at the times of observation and reconstruct the
individual stellar spectra. These are analysed by means of CMFGEN to determine
the stellar properties. We determine the apsidal motion rate in two ways: We
complement our RVs with those reported in the literature and we use the phase
shifts between the primary and secondary eclipses. The light curves are
analysed by means of Nightfall to constrain the orbital inclination and stellar
masses. Stellar structure and evolution models are constructed with Cles.
Different prescriptions for the mixing are adopted. Photometric data of
HD152218 are analysed and stellar evolution models are built. The binary
CPD-41{\deg}7742 displays apsidal motion at a rate of 15.38+0.42-0.51{\deg}
yr-1. Our analysis of the observational data of CPD-41{\deg}7742 explicitly
accounting for the apsidal motion allows us to explain the discrepancy in
periastron longitudes. The age estimates are in good agreement with estimates
obtained for other massive binaries in NGC 6231. This study confirms the need
for enhanced mixing in the stellar evolution models to reproduce the
observational stellar properties; this points towards larger convective cores
than usually considered.

to the potential of its less error propagation, lower latency, and fewer

is severely limited by the available training corpus, especially for domain
adaptation where in-domain triplet training data is scarce or nonexistent. In
this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric method that leverages
domain-specific text translation corpus to achieve domain adaptation for the
E2E-ST system. To this end, we first incorporate an additional encoder into the
pre-trained E2E-ST model to realize text translation modelling, and then unify
the decoder's output representation for text and speech translation tasks by
reducing the correspondent representation mismatch in available triplet
training data. During domain adaptation, a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifier
is introduced to produce the final translation distribution using the external
datastore built by the domain-specific text translation corpus, while the
universal output representation is adopted to perform a similarity search.
Experiments on the Europarl-ST benchmark demonstrate that when in-domain text
translation data is involved only, our proposed approach significantly improves
baseline by 12.82 BLEU on average in all translation directions, even
outperforming the strong in-domain fine-tuning method.

possible, thanks to their product-of-Slater-determinant structure, allowing us

state as well as in the presence of bulk quasihole states. We then explicitly

  flow","24 pages, 20 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The predictions of resolvent analysis for turbulent channel flow are
evaluated for a friction Reynolds number of Retau = 550. In addition to the
standard resolvent operator with kinematic viscosity, a resolvent operator
augmented with the Cess eddy viscosity is considered. Adding eddy viscosity
significantly alters the low-rank behavior of the resolvent. Regardless of the
wave speed selected, the eddy resolvent is low-rank for spanwise wavelengths of
ly+ = 80 and ly/h = 3.5 in comparison to the standard resolvent whose low-rank
behavior depends on the wave speed. The leading eddy modes have higher
projections onto the leading mode from spectral proper orthogonal decomposition
in comparison to standard resolvent modes. Neither analysis, however, reliably
predicts the most energetic wave speed. The standard resolvent tends to
overestimate it while the eddy resolvent underestimates it. When the most
energetic wave speed is underestimated, the eddy modes are energetic too close
to the wall. The eddy resolvent does, however, correctly identify the most
energetic wave speed and mode shapes for structures associated with the
near-wall cycle or that are most energetic at z/h = 0.5. These structures are
likely to be correctly predicted for any friction Reynolds number due to the
scaling of the Cess eddy viscosity profile. Finally, it is shown that the
accuracy of eddy predictions relies on the right balance between positive and
negative energy transfers. Even though eddy viscosity primarily adds
dissipation, its wall-normal gradient injects energy in the near-wall region,
resulting in mode shapes that are attached to the wall. For some scales the
predicted positive energy transfer is too strong thus biasing structures
towards the wall. The ability of the Cess eddy viscosity profile to model both
positive and negative energy transfers suggests that it could be optimized for
individual scales.

the effects of several competing interventions for a given clinical condition.
One of the challenges is that it is not possible in disconnected networks.
Component network meta-analysis (CNMA) allows technically 'reconnecting' a
disconnected network with multicomponent interventions. The additive CNMA model
assumes that the effect of any multicomponent intervention is the additive sum
of its components. This assumption can be relaxed by adding interaction
component terms, which improves the goodness of fit but decreases the network
connectivity. Model selection aims at finding the model with a reasonable
balance between the goodness of fit and connectivity (selected CNMA model). We
aim to introduce a forward model selection strategy for CNMA models and to
investigate the performance of CNMA models for connected and disconnected
networks. We applied the methods to a real Cochrane review dataset and
simulated data with additive, mildly, or strongly violated intervention
effects. We started with connected networks, and we artificially constructed
disconnected networks. We compared the results of the additive and the selected
CNMAs from each connected and disconnected network with the NMA using the mean
squared error and coverage probability. CNMA models provide good performance
for connected networks and can be an alternative to standard NMA if additivity
holds. On the contrary, model selection does not perform well for disconnected
networks, and we recommend conducting separate analyses of subnetworks.

observed in normal dwarf novae, and whose origin has remained unelucidated for
a long time. We examine here the case of V1223 Sgr, an intermediate polar that
showed a short outburst in 1984, and compare the outburst characteristics with
the predictions of the magnetospheric gating model. We use the archival data
from the AAVSO from which we extract the outburst profiles. We use our code for
computing the time-dependent evolution of an accretion disc truncated by the
white dwarf magnetic field, using a simple description of the interaction
between the disc and the magnetic field, as in D'Antona and Spruit (2010). We
find that V1223 Sgr underwent a series of short outbursts, with a rise lasting
for typically two to three hours, and a slightly longer decay. When applied to
intermediate polars, the model by D'Antona and Spruit (2010) accounts well for
the observed outburst duration and intensity. We confirm, however, that the
model outcome depends sensitively on the rather poorly constrained model's
assumptions. We have also searched the AAVSO database for short outbursts in
other IPs, identifying individual short outbursts in FO Aqr, TV Col, NY Lup and
EI UMa, but no series as those observed in V1223 Sgr. We also found a
superoutburst, followed by a reflare in CTCV J2056-3014. Although the
magnetic-gating accretion instability model is clearly responsible for the
series of V1223 Sgr short outbursts and most probably for similar events in
other intermediate polars, the model describing this process needs improving,
in particular concerning the interaction of the white-dwarf's magnetic field
with the accretion disc. This difficult task might benefit from further
comparison of the model outcome with additional observations having good time
coverage and time resolution.

explain dynamical phenomena in varieties of astrophysical systems. The purpose
of this work is to make clear the dynamical essence of the eccentric ZLK effect
by constructing an inherent connection between such an effect and dynamics of
secular resonance in restricted hierarchical planetary systems. Methods.
Dynamical structures of apsidal resonance are analytically studied by means of
perturbative treatments. The resonant model is formulated by averaging the
Hamiltonian (up to octupole order) over rotating ZLK cycles, producing an
additional motion integral. The phase portraits under the resonant model can be
used to analyse dynamical structures, including resonant centres, dynamical
separatrices and islands of libration. Results. By analysing phase portraits,
five branches of libration centres and eight libration zones are found in the
eccentricity--inclination space. There is an excellent agreement between
analytical results of libration zone and numerical distributions of resonant
orbit, indicating that the resonant model for apsidal resonances is valid and
applicable. Additionally, it is found that, in the test-particle limit,
distributions of flipping orbits are dominated by those apsidal resonances
centred at the inclination of i = 90 deg. Conclusions. The eccentric ZLK effect
is dynamically equivalent to the effect of apsidal resonance in restricted
hierarchical planetary systems. The dynamical response of the eccentric ZLK
effect (or effect of apsidal resonance) is to significantly excite
eccentricities and/or inclinations of test particles in the very long-term
evolution.

Although many approaches have been proposed to address this issue, most
existing methods can not satisfy the following three desiderata at the same
time: (1) high translation quality, (2) high match accuracy, and (3) low
latency. In this work, we propose a template-based method that can yield
results with high translation quality and match accuracy and the inference
speed of our method is comparable with unconstrained NMT models. Our basic idea
is to rearrange the generation of constrained and unconstrained tokens through
a template. Our method does not require any changes in the model architecture

within the deformation potential theory. For comparison, we consider the
scattering due to electrostatic potential of charged grain boundary. We show
that at naturally low GB charges the deformation potential scattering dominates
and leads to physically reasonable and, what is important, experimentally
observable values of the electrical resistivity. It ranges from 0.1 to 10
k$\Omega $$\mu $m for different types of GBs with a size of 1 $\mu$m and has a
strong dependence on misorientation angle. For low-angle highly charged GBs,
two scattering mechanisms may compete. The resistivity increases markedly with
decreasing GB size and reaches values of 60 k$\Omega $$\mu $m and more. It is
also very sensitive to the presence of irregularities modeled by embedding of
partial disclination dipoles. With significant distortion, we found an increase

cell GRN analysis is to first cluster the cells and infer GRNs for every

clustering step and thus could lead to inaccurate estimation of the networks.
To address this problem, we propose to model scRNA-seq by the mixture
multivariate Poisson log-normal (MPLN) distribution. The precision matrices of
the MPLN are the GRNs of different cell types and can be jointly estimated by
maximizing MPLN's lasso-penalized log-likelihood. We show that the MPLN model

it to maximise the expected value of a reward function which captures human
preferences, such as non-offensiveness. In this paper, we analyze challenges
associated with treating a language model as an RL policy and show how avoiding
those challenges requires moving beyond the RL paradigm. We start by observing
that the standard RL approach is flawed as an objective for fine-tuning LMs
because it leads to distribution collapse: turning the LM into a degenerate
distribution. Then, we analyze KL-regularised RL, a widely used recipe for
fine-tuning LMs, which additionally constrains the fine-tuned LM to stay close
to its original distribution in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We
show that KL-regularised RL is equivalent to variational inference:
approximating a Bayesian posterior which specifies how to update a prior LM to
conform with evidence provided by the reward function. We argue that this
Bayesian inference view of KL-regularised RL is more insightful than the
typically employed RL perspective. The Bayesian inference view explains how
KL-regularised RL avoids the distribution collapse problem and offers a
first-principles derivation for its objective. While this objective happens to
be equivalent to RL (with a particular choice of parametric reward), there
exist other objectives for fine-tuning LMs which are no longer equivalent to
RL. That observation leads to a more general point: RL is not an adequate
formal framework for problems such as fine-tuning language models. These
problems are best viewed as Bayesian inference: approximating a pre-defined
target distribution.

improving the precision to constrain the Hubble constant. With the increased

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.LG q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How to accurately predict the properties of molecules is an essential problem
in AI-driven drug discovery, which generally requires a large amount of
annotation for training deep learning models. Annotating molecules, however, is
quite costly because it requires lab experiments conducted by experts. To
reduce annotation cost, deep Active Learning (AL) methods are developed to
select only the most representative and informative data for annotating.
However, existing best deep AL methods are mostly developed for a single type
of learning task (e.g., single-label classification), and hence may not perform
well in molecular property prediction that involves various task types. In this
paper, we propose a Task-type-generic active learning framework (termed Tyger)
that is able to handle different types of learning tasks in a unified manner.
The key is to learn a chemically-meaningful embedding space and perform active
selection fully based on the embeddings, instead of relying on
task-type-specific heuristics (e.g., class-wise prediction probability) as done
in existing works. Specifically, for learning the embedding space, we
instantiate a querying module that learns to translate molecule graphs into
corresponding SMILES strings. Furthermore, to ensure that samples selected from
the space are both representative and informative, we propose to shape the
embedding space by two learning objectives, one based on domain knowledge and
the other leveraging feedback from the task learner (i.e., model that performs
the learning task at hand). We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets of different task types. Experimental results show that Tyger
consistently achieves high AL performance on molecular property prediction,
outperforming baselines by a large margin. We also perform ablative experiments
to verify the effectiveness of each component in Tyger.

fast ions in the presence of a shear Alfv\'{e}n wave field with fixed

simulations using the code ORBIT with and without $B_{\Psi_{\rm P}}$ yield
practically the same resonant and nonresonant GC orbits. The numerical results
are consistent with theoretical analyses (presented in the Appendix), which
show that the unabridged GC Lagrangian with $B_{\Psi_{\rm P}}$ retained yields
equations of motion that possess two key properties of Hamiltonian flows: (i)
phase space conservation, and (ii) energy conservation. As counter-examples, we
also show cases where energy conservation (ii) or both conservation laws (i) &
(ii) are broken by omitting certain small terms. When testing the conservative
character of the simulation code, it is found to be beneficial to apply
perturbations that do not resemble normal (eigen)modes of the plasma. The
deviations are enhanced and, thus, more easily spotted when one inspects

scenarios on droplet dispersal, namely the quiescent and the fan-driven
ventilation, both subjected to various climatic conditions (of temperature and
humidity) ranging from cold humid (15 degree C, 70 percent relative humidity)
to hot dry (30 degree C, 30 percent relative humidity and 30 degree C, 50

based on the time averaged pathogen quantity present around the passengers

found that the hot, dry quiescent scenario poses the greatest threat of
infection (spatio averaged risk factor 42 percent), whereas the cold humid
condition poses the least risk of infection (spatio averaged risk factor 30
percent. The implementation of Fan ventilation at low RPM increases the risk as
compared to a quiescent scenario, however with the increase in speed the risk
decreases significantly. The Fan ventilation scenario with 1100 RPM (having a
spatio averaged risk factor of 10 percent) decreases the risk of infection by
67 percent in a hot, dry climatic condition as compared to a quiescent

Fan speed, 1100 RPM. The deposition potential of aerosolized droplets in
various parts of the respiratory tract namely the Extrathoracic and the
Alveolar and Bronchial regions has been analyzed thoroughly because of the

instruments. Our goal is to employ new long wavelength radio data to better
parametrise the broad-band SED of GB 1508+5714, a high-redshift (z=4.30) AGN.
Its high redshift, high intrinsic luminosity, and classification as a blazar
allow us to test emission models that consider the efficient cooling of jet
electrons via inverse Compton losses in interactions with the dense CMB photon
field at high redshifts. A significant detection of this effect in GB 1508+5714
may partly explain the apparent sparsity of high-redshift radio galaxies in
wide-field surveys; detections of this kind are only becoming possible with the
current generation of SKA precursors. We used international LOFAR telescope to
image the long wavelength radio emission around the high-redshift blazar GB
1508+5714 on arcsecond scales at frequencies between 128 MHz and 160 MHz. This
allowed us to compare the spatially resolved structure with higher frequency
observations, and to construct spectral index maps. The LOFAR image shows a
compact unresolved core and two resolved emission regions around 2 arcsec to
the east and to the west of the radio core. We find structure consistent with
previous VLA observations, as well as a previously unreported emission region
to the east. We interpret the arcsecond-scale radio structure of GB 1508+5714
as a FR II-like radio galaxy at a small viewing angle. Our SED modelling shows
that a scenario featuring significant quenching effects caused by interaction
with the CMB provides a good description of the data, and notably explains the
suppressed radio emission.

Existing traffic signal control systems in use still rely heavily on

better planning of each agent in policy optimization. To better learn such
adaptive and predictive priors, traditional
  RL-based methods can only return a fixed length from predefined action pool
with only local agents. If there is no cooperation between these agents, some
agents often make conflicts to other agents and thus decrease the whole

dual-continuum model which is generalized as a multi-continuum model for a
coupled system of nonlinear Richards equations as unsaturated flows, in complex
heterogeneous fractured porous media; and we will solve it by a novel
multiscale approach utilizing the constraint energy minimizing generalized

(whose global convergence is proved theoretically). Subsequently, we tackle the
resulting linearized equations by the CEM-GMsFEM and obtain proper offline
multiscale basis functions to span the multiscale space (which contains the
pressure solution). More specifically, we first introduce two new sources of
samples, and the GMsFEM is used over each coarse block to build local auxiliary
multiscale basis functions via solving local spectral problems, that are
crucial for detecting high-contrast channels. Second, per oversampled coarse
region, local multiscale basis functions are created through the CEM as
constrainedly minimizing an energy functional. Various numerical tests for our
approach reveal that the error converges with the coarse-grid size alone and

be used in many disciplines. However, the applications based on a quantum

time-energy degrees of freedom of biphoton wavefunction still remains
relatively unexplored. Here, we use a quantum Wiener-Khinchin theorem (QWKT) to
state that two-photon joint spectral intensity and the cross-correlation of

mathematically-defined QWKT is experimentally demonstrated in
frequency-entangled two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference with the
assistance of spectrally-resolved detection. We apply this method to
spectral-domain quantum optical coherence tomography that detects
thickness-induced optical delays in a transparent sample, and show that our

wide dynamic range and capturing time over the conventional HOM interferometric

is the Farlie-GumbelMorgenstern (FGM) copula since their simple analytic shape
enables closed-form solutions to many problems in applied probability. However,
the classical definition of high-dimensional FGM copula does not enable a
straightforward understanding of the effect of the copula parameters on the

circumvent this issue by studying the FGM copula from a probabilistic approach

high-dimensional exchangeable FGM copulas, a subclass of FGM copulas. We show
that dependence parameters of exchangeable FGM can be expressed as convex hulls
of a finite number of extreme points and establish partial orders for different
exchangeable FGM copulas (including maximal and minimal dependence). We also
leverage the probabilistic interpretation to develop efficient sampling and

geometric interpretations of the copula parameters that assist one in decoding

connecting information theory and thermodynamics, as it is a logically
irreversible task. We provide a new angle on this connection, noting that there
may be an additional cost to erasure, that is not captured by standard results
such as Landauer's principle. To make this point we use a model of
irreversibility based on Constructor Theory - a recently proposed
generalization of the quantum theory of computation. The model uses a machine
called the ""quantum homogenizer"", which has the ability to approximately
realise the transformation of a qubit from any state to any other state and
remain approximately unchanged, through overall entirely unitary interactions.
We argue that when performing erasure via quantum homogenization there is an
additional cost to performing the erasure step of the Szilard's engine, because
it is more difficult to reliably produce pure states in a cycle than to produce
mixed states. We also discuss the implications of this result for the cost of
erasure in more general terms.

sparse interferometric coverage of the 2017 observations, alongside the short
variability timescale of Sgr A$^*$ compared to M87$^*$. Concerning this point,
we comment on the results of a recent preprint which purports to have derived

mostly have to rely on $r_{\rm sh}$, whereas additional observables such as the
photon ring and azimuthal angle lapse should soon be available and allow for
novel tests.

Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons that reionized the intergalactic medium at high
redshifts. However, above z >~ 6, the neutral intergalactic medium prevents
direct observations of LyC. Therefore, recent years have seen the development
of indirect indicators for LyC that can be calibrated at lower redshifts and
applied in the Epoch of Reionization. Emission from Mg II \ly\ly 2796, 2803
doublet has been proposed as a promising LyC proxy. In this paper, we present
new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations for 8 LyC
emitter candidates, selected to have strong Mg II emission lines. We securely
detect LyC emission in 50% (4/8) galaxies with 2$\sigma$ significance. This
high detection rate suggests that strong Mg II emitters might be more likely to
leak LyC than similar galaxies without strong Mg II. Using photoionization
models, we constrain the escape fraction of Mg II as ~ 15 -- 60%. We confirm
that the escape fraction of Mg II correlates tightly with that of Lyman-alpha
(LyA), which we interpret as an indication that the escape fraction of both
species is controlled by resonant scattering in the same low column density
gas. Furthermore, we show that the combination of the Mg II emission and dust
attenuation can be used to estimate the escape fraction of LyC statistically.
These findings confirm that Mg II emission can be adopted to estimate the
escape fraction of LyA and LyC in local star-forming galaxies and may serve as
a useful indirect indicator at the Epoch of Reionization.

reported high-frequency features from sector 7. We discuss the plausible
mechanisms that may be responsible for such variability in WR7, including
pulsations, binarity, co-rotating interacting regions (CIRs) and clumpy winds.
Given the lack of strong evidence for the presence of a stellar or compact

to wind variability likely caused by CIRs on top of stochastic low-frequency
variability. WR7 is certainly a worthy target for future monitoring in both

Real-world EO datasets are instead characterized by a large heterogeneity

paper we propose a new algorithm for merging SSL and CL for remote sensing
applications, that we call Continual Barlow Twins (CBT). It combines the
advantages of one of the simplest self-supervision techniques, i.e., Barlow

deep models, which is notoriously data-hungry. Until recently, deep active
learning methods were ineffectual in the low-budget regime, where only a small
number of examples are annotated. The situation has been alleviated by recent
advances in representation and self-supervised learning, which impart the
geometry of the data representation with rich information about the points.
Taking advantage of this progress, we study the problem of subset selection for
annotation through a ""covering"" lens, proposing ProbCover - a new active
learning algorithm for the low budget regime, which seeks to maximize
Probability Coverage. We then describe a dual way to view the proposed
formulation, from which one can derive strategies suitable for the high budget
regime of active learning, related to existing methods like Coreset. We
conclude with extensive experiments, evaluating ProbCover in the low-budget
regime. We show that our principled active learning strategy improves the
state-of-the-art in the low-budget regime in several image recognition
benchmarks. This method is especially beneficial in the semi-supervised
setting, allowing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods to match the
performance of fully supervised methods, while using much fewer labels

structure to learn nodes/graph representations. Nevertheless, it is found that
many existing graph learning methods do not work well on data with high
heterophily level that accounts for a large proportion of edges between
different class labels. Recent efforts to this problem focus on improving the
message passing mechanism. However, it remains unclear whether heterophily
truly does harm to the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). The key is
to unfold the relationship between a node and its immediate neighbors, e.g.,
are they heterophilous or homophilious? From this perspective, here we study
the role of heterophily in graph representation learning before/after the
relationships between connected nodes are disclosed. In particular, we propose
an end-to-end framework that both learns the type of edges (i.e.,
heterophilous/homophilious) and leverage edge type information to improve the
expressiveness of graph neural networks. We implement this framework in two
different ways. Specifically, to avoid messages passing through heterophilous
edges, we can optimize the graph structure to be homophilious by dropping
heterophilous edges identified by an edge classifier. Alternatively, it is
possible to exploit the information about the presence of heterophilous
neighbors for feature learning, so a hybrid message passing approach is devised
to aggregate homophilious neighbors and diversify heterophilous neighbors based
on edge classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable
performance improvement of GNNs with the proposed framework on multiple
datasets across the full spectrum of homophily level.

new training dataset representing exotic pet animals advertised for sale on the

combination of five different architectures, three methods of training and two
types of datasets. Specifically, model generalisation improved after setting a
portion of the training images to represent negative features. Models were
evaluated on both within and out of distribution data to test wider model
applicability. The top performing models achieved an f-score of over 0.95 on
within distribution evaluation and between 0.75 to 0.87 on the two out of

performed well in detecting the surrounding context (e.g. a cage) in which an
animal was located, therefore helping to automatically detect images of animals
in non-natural environments. The proposed methods can help investigate the
online wildlife trade, but can also be adapted to study other types of

CHEX-MATE (Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and

the aim to provide a classification of their dynamical state. To investigate
the link between the X-ray appearance and the dynamical state, we considered
four morphological parameters: the surface brightness concentration, the
centroid shift, and the second- and third-order power ratios. These indicators
result to be: strongly correlated with each other, powerful in identifying the
disturbed and relaxed population, characterised by a unimodal distribution and
not strongly influenced by systematic uncertainties. In order to obtain a
continuous classification of the CHEX-MATE objects, we combined these four
parameters in a single quantity, M, which represents the grade of relaxation of
a system. On the basis of the M value, we identified the most extreme systems
of the sample, finding 15 very relaxed and 27 very disturbed galaxy clusters.
From a comparison with previous analysis on X-ray selected samples, we
confirmed that the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) clusters tend to be more disturbed.
Finally, by applying our analysis on a simulated sample, we found a general
agreement between the observed and simulated results, with the only exception
of the concentration. This latter behaviour, is partially related to the
presence of particles with high smoothed-particle hydrodynamics density in the
central regions of the simulated clusters due to the action of the idealised
isotropic thermal Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback.

innovative applications such as autonomous driving and environment monitoring.
Perceptive mobile networks (PMNs) were proposed to add sensing capability to
current cellular networks. Different from traditional radar, the cellular
structure of PMNs offers multiple perspectives to sense the same target, but
the inherent interference between sensing and communication along with the
joint processing among distributed sensing nodes (SNs) also cause big
challenges for the design of PMNs. In this paper, we first propose a two-stage
protocol to tackle the interference between two sub-systems. Specifically, the
echoes created by communication signals, i.e., interference for sensing, are
first estimated in the clutter estimation (CE) stage and then utilized for
interference management in the target sensing (TS) stage. A networked sensing
detector is then derived to exploit the perspectives provided by multiple SNs
for sensing the same target. The macro-diversity from multiple SNs together
with the array gain and the higher angular resolution from multiple receive
antennas of each SN are investigated to reveal the benefit of networked
sensing. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient condition to guarantee one SN's
contribution is positive, based on which a SN selection algorithm is proposed.
To reduce the communication workload, we propose a distributed model-driven
deep-learning algorithm that utilizes partially-sampled data for CE. Simulation
results confirm the benefits of networked sensing and validate the higher
efficiency of the proposed CE algorithm than existing methods.

its superior performance for learning node/graph representations without

distribution inevitably deteriorates the quality of learned node
representations in GCL. Indeed, we empirically find that most state-of-the-art

we propose a principled GCL framework on Imbalanced node classification
(ImGCL), which automatically and adaptively balances the representations
learned from GCL without labels. Specifically, we first introduce the online
clustering based progressively balanced sampling (PBS) method with theoretical
rationale, which balances the training sets based on pseudo-labels obtained
from learned representations in GCL. We then develop the node centrality based
PBS method to better preserve the intrinsic structure of graphs, by upweighting
the important nodes of the given graph. Extensive experiments on multiple
imbalanced graph datasets and imbalanced settings demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed framework, which significantly improves the performance of the

predators. In this way, camouflage acts as a key defence mechanism across
species that is critical to survival. To detect and segment the whole scope of
a camouflaged object, camouflaged object detection (COD) is introduced as a
binary segmentation task, with the binary ground truth camouflage map
indicating the exact regions of the camouflaged objects. In this paper, we
revisit this task and argue that the binary segmentation setting fails to fully
understand the concept of camouflage. We find that explicitly modeling the
conspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their particular backgrounds can
not only lead to a better understanding about camouflage, but also provide
guidance to designing more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we
observe that it is some specific parts of camouflaged objects that make them
detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged
objects, we present the first triple-task learning framework to simultaneously
localize, segment, and rank camouflaged objects, indicating the conspicuousness
level of camouflage. As no corresponding datasets exist for either the
localization model or the ranking model, we generate localization maps with an
eye tracker, which are then processed according to the instance level labels to
generate our ranking-based training and testing dataset. We also contribute the
largest COD testing set to comprehensively analyse performance of the COD
models. Experimental results show that our triple-task learning framework
achieves new state-of-the-art, leading to a more explainable COD network. Our

a computational challenge owing to both the large amount of information to be
processed and the new methods needed to combine data from different sources
(e.g. obtained by different techniques, in different bands, and having
different random and systematic errors). The main goal of this work is to
develop an algorithm capable of merging sparse and dense data sets, both
relative and differential, in preparation for asteroid observations originating
from, for example, Gaia, TESS, ATLAS, LSST, K2, VISTA, and many other sources.
We present a novel method to obtain asteroid phase curves by combining sparse
photometry and differential ground-based photometry. In the traditional
approach, the latter cannot be used for phase curves. Merging those two data
types allows for the extraction of phase-curve information for a growing number
of objects. Our method is validated for 26 sample asteroids observed by the

${\dot \varepsilon}_{\rm eng}$, for others, $\sigma_{\rm max}$ increases with
increasing ${\dot \varepsilon}_{\rm eng}$, and for others $\sigma_{\rm max}$
versus ${\dot \varepsilon}_{\rm eng}$ is nonmonotonic. Using numerical
simulations of metallic glasses undergoing uniaxial compression at nonzero
strain rate and temperature, we show that they obey a universal relation for
the compressive strength versus temperature, which determines their mechanical
response. At low ${\dot \varepsilon}_{\rm eng}$, increasing strain rate leads
to increases in temperature and decreases in $\sigma^*_{\rm max}$, whereas at
high ${\dot \varepsilon}_{\rm eng}$, increasing strain rate leads to decreases
in temperature and increases in $\sigma^*_{\rm max}$. This non-monotonic
behavior of $\sigma^*_{\rm max}$ versus temperature causes the nonmonotonic
behavior of $\sigma^*_{\rm max}$ versus ${\dot \varepsilon}_{\rm eng}$.
Variations in the internal dissipation change the characteristic strain rate at
which the nonmonotonic behavior occurs. These results are general for a wide
range of metallic glasses with different atomic interactions, damping

super-resolution network at a fixed scaling factor, which is not friendly to
clinical scenes of varying inter-slice spacing in MR scanning. Inspired by the
recent progress in implicit neural representation, we propose a Spatial

can reconstruct the MR image with arbitrary inter-slice spacing by continuously

more accurately in a larger receptive field. Meanwhile, to improve the

encapsulated by a refined growing mode $D$ of linear density fluctuations. Here
we solve, to arbitrary high perturbative orders, the nonlinear fluid equations
with an {\it Ansatz} for the fluid variables in increasing powers of $D$. We
show that $\Lambda$ begins to populate the solutions starting at the fifth
order in this strict $D$-expansion. By applying suitable resummation
techniques, we recast these solutions to a standard perturbative series where
not $D$, but essentially the initial gravitational potential serves as the
bookkeeping parameter within the expansion. Then, by using the refined growth
functions at second and third order in standard perturbation theory, we
determine the matter power spectrum to one-loop accuracy as well as the
leading-order contribution to the matter bispectrum. We find that employing our
refined growth functions impacts the total power- and bispectra at a precision
that is below one percent at late times. However, for the power spectrum, we
find a characteristic scale-dependent suppression that is fairly similar to
what is observed in massive neutrino cosmologies. Therefore, we recommend
employing our refined growth functions in order to reduce theoretical
uncertainties for analysing data in related pipelines.

heat transfer due to the much lower thermal conductivity of gases as compared
to liquids and changes the structure of the boundary layers. The numerical
simulations are performed in 3D at Prandtl number Pr=4.38 (water) and Rayleigh
number $10^7\le Ra \le10^8$. For simplicity, we assume the bubbles to be
equally-sized and having pinned contact lines. We vary the total gas-covered
area fraction $0.18 \le S_0 \le 0.62$, the relative bubble height $0.02\le h/H
\le0.05$ (where $H$ is the height of the Rayleigh-B\'enard cell), the bubble
number $40 \le n \le 144$, and their spatial distribution. In all cases,
asymmetric temperature profiles are observed, which we quantitatively explain
based on the heat flux conservation at each horizontal section. We further
propose the idea of using an equivalent single-phase setup to mimic the system
with attached bubbles. Based on this equivalence, we can calculate the heat
transfer. Without introducing any free parameter, the predictions for the
Nusselt number, the upper and lower thermal boundary layer thicknesses, and the
mean centre temperature well agree with the numerical results. Finally, our

observed at small heliocentric distances below about 40 solar radii and are
known to occur in regions with quiescent magnetic fields. We show the close
connection of these waves with the large-scale properties of the magnetic
field. Near electron gyrofrequency harmonics emissions occur only when the
ambient magnetic field points to a narrow range of directions bounded by polar
and azimuthal angular ranges in the RTN coordinate system of correspondingly
$80^{\circ} \lesssim \theta_B \lesssim 100^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ} \lesssim

highest when both angles are close to the center of their respective angular
interval favorable to wave emissions. The intensity of wave emissions
correlates with the magnetic field angular changes at both large and small time
scales. Wave emissions intervals correlate with intervals of decreases in the
amplitudes of broadband magnetic fluctuations at low frequencies of 10Hz-100Hz.
We discuss possible generation mechanisms of the waves.

we present POLTER (Policy Trajectory Ensemble Regularization) - a general

utilizes an ensemble of policies that are discovered during pretraining and
moves the policy of the URL algorithm closer to its optimal prior. Our method

  Our key contribution is to give a bound on the Rademacher complexity for a

signal-to-interference ratios exceeding 20 dB can cause significant throughput
degradation and latency. Furthermore, the resultant packet error rate may not
be enough to force the WiFi network to fallback to a more robust physical layer
configuration. Deep learning applied directly to sampled radio frequency data
has the potential to perform detection much cheaper than successive
interference cancellation, which is important for real-time persistent network
monitoring. The techniques explored in this work include maximum softmax
probability, distance metric learning, variational autoencoder, and
autoreggressive log-likelihood. We also introduce the notion of generalized
outlier exposure for these techniques, and show its importance in detecting
weak interference. Our results indicate that with outlier exposure, maximum
softmax probability, distance metric learning, and autoreggresive
log-likelihood are capable of reliably detecting interference more than 20 dB

a unique software solution to real-time, persistent network monitoring.

the GD recursion is augmented with chaotic perturbations that evolve via an

By building up on recent advances in rough paths theory, we show that, under
appropriate assumptions, as the step-size decreases, the MPGD recursion
converges weakly to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a
heavy-tailed L\'evy-stable process. (ii) By making connections to recently
developed generalization bounds for heavy-tailed processes, we derive a

generalization error over the trajectories of the process to the parameters of
MPGD. (iii) We analyze the implicit regularization effect brought by the

(CE) with chores when agents have linear preferences. CE is one of the most
preferred mechanisms for allocating a set of items among agents. CE with equal
incomes (CEEI), Fisher, and Arrow-Debreu (exchange) are the fundamental
economic models to study allocation problems, where CEEI is a special case of
Fisher and Fisher is a special case of exchange. When the items are goods
(giving utility), the CE set is convex even in the exchange model, facilitating
several combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms (starting with the seminal
work of Devanur, Papadimitriou, Saberi and Vazirani) for all of these models.
In sharp contrast, when the items are chores (giving disutility), the CE set is
known to be non-convex and disconnected even in the CEEI model. Further, no
combinatorial algorithms or hardness results are known for these models. In
this paper, we give two main results for CE with chores:
  1) A combinatorial algorithm to compute a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate CEEI
in time $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4m^2 / \varepsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the number
of agents and $m$ is the number of chores.
  2) PPAD-hardness of finding a $(1-1/\mathit{poly}(n))$-approximate CE in the
exchange model under a sufficient condition. To the best of our knowledge,
these results show the first separation between the CEEI and exchange models
when agents have linear preferences, assuming PPAD $\neq $ P.
  Finally, we show that our new insight implies a straightforward proof of the
existence of an allocation that is both envy-free up to one chore (EF1) and
Pareto optimal (PO) in the discrete setting when agents have factored bivalued

choose between political candidates to vote for, between social media posts to

increasingly abundant. Discrete choice models are a key tool for learning
individual preferences from such data. Additionally, social factors like
conformity and contagion influence individual choice. Existing methods for
incorporating these factors into choice models do not account for the entire
social network and require hand-crafted features. To overcome these
limitations, we use graph learning to study choice in networked contexts. We
identify three ways in which graph learning techniques can be used for discrete
choice: learning chooser representations, regularizing choice model parameters,
and directly constructing predictions from a network. We design methods in each
category and test them on real-world choice datasets, including county-level
2016 US election results and Android app installation and usage data. We show
that incorporating social network structure can improve the predictions of the
standard econometric choice model, the multinomial logit. We provide evidence
that app installations are influenced by social context, but we find no such
effect on app usage among the same participants, which instead is habit-driven.
In the election data, we highlight the additional insights a discrete choice
framework provides over classification or regression, the typical approaches.
On synthetic data, we demonstrate the sample complexity benefit of using social

task identity of newly included task (a set of classes) remains known during

Way (MW), and even on the nature of DM itself, with current and upcoming
stellar surveys reigniting the discussion on response modes in dynamical
friction. However, the simulation of such features remains computationally
challenging. We used a collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE)+Poisson solver
based on an existing method from the literature. We investigated the density
and velocity response modes in simulations of Galactic-type DM halos accreting
LMC-sized satellites, including the dependence on the halo density profile. We
successfully captured both the local wake and the global over- and underdensity
induced in the host halo. We also captured the velocity response. In line with
previous studies, we find that the code can reproduce the core formation in the
cuspy profile and the satellite core stalling. The angular power spectrum (APS)
response is shown to be sensitive to each density profile. The cored Plummer
density profile seems the most responsive, displaying a richness of modes. At
the end of the simulation, the central halo acquires cylindrical rotation. The
CBE description makes it tenable to capture the response modes with a better
handling of noise in comparison to traditional N-body simulations. Hence, given
a certain noise level, BPM has a lower computational cost than N-body
simulations, making it feasible to explore large parameter sets. We anticipate
that stellar spheroids in the MW or external galaxies could show central
cylindrical rotation if they underwent a massive accretion event. The code can
be adjusted to include a variety of DM physics.

which increase quadratically in the token number. We present a novel training
paradigm that trains only one ViT model at a time, but is capable of providing
improved image recognition performance with various computational costs. Here,
the trained ViT model, termed super vision transformer (SuperViT), is empowered
with the versatile ability to solve incoming patches of multiple sizes as well
as preserve informative tokens with multiple keeping rates (the ratio of
keeping tokens) to achieve good hardware efficiency for inference, given that
the available hardware resources often change from time to time. Experimental
results on ImageNet demonstrate that our SuperViT can considerably reduce the
computational costs of ViT models with even performance increase. For example,
we reduce 2x FLOPs of DeiT-S while increasing the Top-1 accuracy by 0.2% and
0.7% for 1.5x reduction. Also, our SuperViT significantly outperforms existing
studies on efficient vision transformers. For example, when consuming the same
amount of FLOPs, our SuperViT surpasses the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) EViT
by 1.1% when using DeiT-S as their backbones. The project of this work is made

subject to automation. However, controlling them accurately, e.g., when
parking, is known to be challenging for automatic control methods, including
model predictive control (MPC). Combining results from MPC theory and
sub-Riemannian geometry in the form of homogeneous nilpotent system
approximations, this paper proposes a comprehensive, ready-to-apply design
procedure for MPC controllers to steer controllable, driftless non-holonomic
vehicles into given setpoints. It can be ascertained that the resulting
controllers nominally asymptotically stabilize the setpoint for a large-enough
prediction horizon. The design procedure is exemplarily applied to four
vehicles, including the kinematic car and a differentially driven mobile robot
with up to two trailers. The controllers use a non-quadratic cost function
tailored to the non-holonomic kinematics. Novelly, for the considered example
vehicles, it is proven that a quadratic cost employed in an otherwise similar
controller is insufficient to reliably asymptotically stabilize the closed
loop. Since quadratic costs are the conventional choice in control, this
highlights the relevance of the findings. To the knowledge of the authors, it
is the first time that MPC controllers of the proposed structure are applied to
non-holonomic vehicles beyond very simple ones, in particular (partly) on
hardware.

only the three conditions $g_{rr}=0=g_{rA}$ are fixed. We relax in particular
the so-called determinant condition on the transverse metric, which is only
assumed to admit a polyhomogeneous radial expansion. This is sufficient in
order to build the solution space, which here includes a cosmological constant,
time-dependent sources in the boundary metric, logarithmic branches, and an
extra trace mode at subleading order in the transverse metric. The evolution
equations are studied using the Newman-Penrose formalism in terms of covariant
functionals identified from the Weyl scalars, and we build the explicit
dictionary between this formalism and the tensorial Einstein equations. This
provides in particular a new derivation of the (A)dS mass loss formula. We then
study the holographic renormalisation of the symplectic potential, and the
transformation laws under residual asymptotic symmetries. The advantage of the
partial Bondi gauge is that it allows to contrast and treat in a unified manner
the Bondi-Sachs and Newman-Unti gauges, which can each be reached upon imposing
a further specific gauge condition. The differential determinant condition
leads to the $\Lambda$-BMSW gauge, while a differential condition on $g_{ur}$
leads to a generalized Newman-Unti gauge. This latter gives access to a new
asymptotic symmetry which acts on the asymptotic shear and further extends the
$\Lambda$-BMSW group by an extra abelian radial translation. This generalizes
results which we have recently obtained in three dimensions.

separability problem, i.e. distinguishing separable and entangled states,
generally lacks an efficient solution due to the existence of bound entangled
states. In contrast to free entangled states that can be used for entanglement
distillation via local operations and classical communication, these states
cannot be detected by the Peres-Horodecki criterion or PPT criterion. We
analyze a large family of bipartite qutrit states that can be separable, free
entangled or bound entangled. Leveraging a geometrical representation of these
states in Euclidean space, novel methods are presented that allow the
classification of separable and bound entangled Bell diagonal states in an
efficient way. Moreover, the classification allows the precise determination of
relative volumes of the classes of separable, free and bound entangled states.
In detail, out of all Bell diagonal PPT states $81.0 \%\pm0.1\%$ are determined
to be separable while $13.9\pm0.1\%$ are bound entangled and only $5.1\pm0.1\%$
remain unclassified. Moreover, our applied criteria are compared for their

Observing a neutrino flux from GRBs would offer evidence that GRBs are hadronic
accelerators of UHECRs. Previous IceCube analyses, which primarily focused on
neutrinos arriving in temporal coincidence with the prompt gamma rays, found no
significant neutrino excess. The four analyses presented in this paper extend
the region of interest to 14 days before and after the prompt phase, including
generic extended time windows and targeted precursor searches. GRBs were
selected between May 2011 and October 2018 to align with the data set of
candidate muon-neutrino events observed by IceCube. No evidence of correlation
between neutrino events and GRBs was found in these analyses. Limits are set to
constrain the contribution of the cosmic GRB population to the diffuse
astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. Prompt neutrino emission from
GRBs is limited to $\lesssim$1% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux, and
emission on timescales up to $10^4$ s is constrained to 24% of the total

cost of quantum metrology. One of the main results is $\mathcal{S} \geq \log(2)
\| h_\lambda \|^{-2} F_Q [\psi_\lambda]$, which purports to relate the Shannon
entropy $\mathcal{S}$ of an optimal measurement (i.e., in the basis of the
symmetric logarithmic derivative) to the quantum Fisher information $F_Q$ of
the pure state $|\psi_\lambda\rangle$. However, we show that in the setting
considered by the authors we have $\mathcal{S} = \log(2)$ and $\| h_\lambda

reduces to the trivial inequality $\max_{\psi_\lambda} F_Q[\psi_\lambda] \geq
F_Q[\psi_\lambda]$, and does not in fact relate the entropy $\mathcal{S}$ to
the quantum Fisher information. Moreover, for pure state quantum metrology,
there exist optimal measurements (though not in the basis of the symmetric
logarithmic derivative) for which $0 \leq \mathcal{S} \leq \log(2)$, leading to
violations of the inequality for some states $|\psi_\lambda\rangle$.

  2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Gradient-boosted regression trees (GBRTs) are hugely popular for solving
tabular regression problems, but provide no estimate of uncertainty. We propose
Instance-Based Uncertainty estimation for Gradient-boosted regression trees
(IBUG), a simple method for extending any GBRT point predictor to produce
probabilistic predictions. IBUG computes a non-parametric distribution around a
prediction using the $k$-nearest training instances, where distance is measured
with a tree-ensemble kernel. The runtime of IBUG depends on the number of
training examples at each leaf in the ensemble, and can be improved by sampling
trees or training instances. Empirically, we find that IBUG achieves similar or
better performance than the previous state-of-the-art across 22 benchmark
regression datasets. We also find that IBUG can achieve improved probabilistic
performance by using different base GBRT models, and can more flexibly model
the posterior distribution of a prediction than competing methods. We also find
that previous methods suffer from poor probabilistic calibration on some
datasets, which can be mitigated using a scalar factor tuned on the validation
data. Source code is available at https://www.github.com/jjbrophy47/ibug.

employed for this task. On top of this, SDRs may exhibit quirks causing signal
artefacts that obstruct the effective collection of channel estimation data.
Based on these considerations, in this work, a practical algorithm is devised
to compensate for the drawbacks of using SDRs for channel sounding encountered
in a concrete setup. The proposed approach utilises concepts from time series
and Fourier analysis and comprises a signal restoration routine for mitigating
artefacts within the recorded signals and an encompassing channel sounding
process. The efficacy of the algorithm is evaluated on real measurements
generated within the given setup. The empirical results show that the proposed

Over 30,000 miles of road are added yearly to the already enormous road system

option but to walk across them for food, water and companionship. In this
process they end up becoming roadkill. Wherever wildlife habitat and roadways
overlap, death and destruction seem impossible to control. These animal deaths
have a direct impact on the biodiversity and dynamics of an ecosystem and
roadkill poses a threat to many species that are fighting extinction. Vehicles
colliding with animals results in human fatalities, life changing injuries and
extensive property damage. Current methods of handling roadkill are primarily
passive and do not utilize the animal's natural instincts. This paper presents
an alternative approach by actively involving the animal, warning them of an
oncoming vehicle and triggering their survival instincts. Making the animal an
integral part of the solution, augmenting their sensory perception with science

provides a better chance at mitigating the problem of roadkill. The results
show that this solution is able to provide animals a warning of an oncoming

network security. Nevertheless, identifying an ongoing attack in a

solution to collaborative training for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The
federated learning-based IDS trains a global model using local machine learning
models provided by federated participants without sharing local data. However,
optimization challenges are intrinsic to federated learning. This paper
proposes the Federated Simulated Annealing (FedSA) metaheuristic to select the
hyperparameters and a subset of participants for each aggregation round in
federated learning. FedSA optimizes hyperparameters linked to the global model
convergence. The proposal reduces aggregation rounds and speeds up convergence.
Thus, FedSA accelerates learning extraction from local models, requiring fewer
IDS updates. The proposal assessment shows that the FedSA global model
converges in less than ten communication rounds. The proposal requires up to
50% fewer aggregation rounds to achieve approximately 97% accuracy in attack
detection than the conventional aggregation approach.

only for large-scale machine learning, but also for preserving privacy. One of
the key challenges in decentralized learning is that the data distribution held
by each node is statistically heterogeneous. To address this challenge, the
primal-dual algorithm called the Edge-Consensus Learning (ECL) was proposed and
was experimentally shown to be robust to the heterogeneity of data
distributions. However, the convergence rate of the ECL is provided only when
the objective function is convex, and has not been shown in a standard machine
learning setting where the objective function is non-convex. Furthermore, the
intuitive reason why the ECL is robust to the heterogeneity of data
distributions has not been investigated. In this work, we first investigate the
relationship between the ECL and Gossip algorithm and show that the update
formulas of the ECL can be regarded as correcting the local stochastic gradient
in the Gossip algorithm. Then, we propose the Generalized ECL (G-ECL), which
contains the ECL as a special case, and provide the convergence rates of the
G-ECL in both (strongly) convex and non-convex settings, which do not depend on
the heterogeneity of data distributions. Through synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that the numerical results of both the G-ECL and ECL coincide with
the convergence rate of the G-ECL.

thought to have amassed a large body of liquid water in its ancient past. NASA
spectra of the proposed paleolake interpret the youngest surface unit as
olivine-bearing minerals crystallized from magma. In early 2021, the
Perseverance rover landed at the leading edge of a fan-delta deposit northwest
of Jezero, an area argued to have experienced two distinct periods of fluvial
activity. Surface imagery obtained by Perseverance reveal partially buried and
unburied vesicular and non-vesicular rocks that appear volcanic in origin,
emplaced sometime during the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. The absence of
volcanic extrusive features along the fan-delta deposit, however, have made the
origin of these ballast deposits a matter of contention among planetary
scientists. To establish the origin of these basalt-like rocks, a comparison
was made between analogous deposits on the Moenkopi Plateau in Arizona with
similar deposits imaged by Perseverance on Jezero. The search for geologic
analogs along the Moenkopi Plateau were guided by observable similarities in
surface geomorphology, influenced and modified by fluvial, eolian, and past
volcanic activity, primarily from the Late Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. By
analyzing surface imagery taken by Perseverance and comparing it with the
analogue site, we hypothesize that the exposed vesicular rocks imaged by
Perseverance were likely transported into the paleolake by geomorphic
interactions, specifically fluvial processes similarly to the deposits that
were transported along drainage patterns we observed on the Moenkopi Plateau.

  Convolutions for Recommendation","9pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Leveraging graphs on recommender systems has gained popularity with the
development of graph representation learning (GRL). In particular, knowledge
graph embedding (KGE) and graph neural networks (GNNs) are representative GRL
approaches, which have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on several
recommendation tasks. Furthermore, combination of KGE and GNNs (KG-GNNs) has
been explored and found effective in many academic literatures. One of the main
characteristics of GNNs is their ability to retain structural properties among
neighbors in the resulting dense representation, which is usually coined as
smoothing. The smoothing is specially desired in the presence of homophilic
graphs, such as the ones we find on recommender systems. In this paper, we
propose a new model for recommender systems named Knowledge Query-based Graph
Convolution (KQGC). In contrast to exisiting KG-GNNs, KQGC focuses on the
smoothing, and leverages a simple linear graph convolution for smoothing KGE. A
pre-trained KGE is fed into KQGC, and it is smoothed by aggregating neighbor
knowledge queries, which allow entity-embeddings to be aligned on appropriate
vector points for smoothing KGE effectively. We apply the proposed KQGC to a
recommendation task that aims prospective users for specific products.
Extensive experiments on a real E-commerce dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of KQGC.

However, this procedure generally requires a high computational effort for the

phase transitions in cosmology, e.g., at the GUT energy scale (~10^15 GeV),
resulting in a quasi-de Sitter inflationary expansion, solving the background
temperature horizon problem. This transition would have occurred at t~10^-36 to
10^-33 seconds, leading to a separation of the strong and electroweak forces.
The discovery of the Higgs boson confirms that the Universe must have undergone
another phase transition at the electroweak (EWPT) scale 159.5+/-1.5 GeV, about
10^-11 seconds later, when fermions and the W^+/- and Z^0 bosons gained mass,
leading to the separation of the electric and weak forces. But today the vacuum
expectation value (vev) of the Higgs field appears to be uniform throughout the
visible Universe, a region much larger than causally-connected volumes at the
EWPT. The discovery of the Higgs boson thus creates another serious horizon
problem for LCDM, for which there is currently no established theoretical
resolution. The EWPT was a smooth crossover, however, so previously
disconnected electroweak vacuua might have homogenized as they gradually came
into causal contact. But using the known Higgs potential and vev, we estimate
that this process would have taken longer than the age of the Universe, so it
probably could not have mitigated the emergence of different standard model
parameters across the sky. The EWPT horizon problem thus argues against the
expansion history of the early Universe predicted by standard cosmology.

Therefore, people still hope to obtain a generic Copula estimation method with
both universality and simplicity. To reach this goal, a novel neural
network-based method (named Neural Copula) is proposed in this paper. In this
method, a hierarchical unsupervised neural network is constructed to estimate
the marginal distribution function and the Copula function by solving
differential equations. In the training program, various constraints are
imposed on both the neural network and its derivatives. The Copula estimated by
the proposed method is smooth and has an analytic expression. The effectiveness
of the proposed method is evaluated on both real-world datasets and complex

quality for complex distributions is much better than classical methods. The

of accuracy using GEPP is $m+O(\log n)$, which improves an earlier estimate
$m+O(\log^2 n)$ of Sankar, and which we conjecture to be optimal by the order

be used to support the empirical observation that GEPP is more stable than the
