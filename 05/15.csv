zero-temperature landscape on the visible units and depending only on the tail
behaviour of the hidden layer prior distribution. Studying the location of the
local minima of such an energy function, we show that the ability of a
restricted Boltzmann machine to reconstruct a random pattern depends indeed
only on the tail of the hidden prior distribution. We find that hidden priors
with strictly super-Gaussian tails give only a logarithmic loss in pattern
retrieval, while an efficient retrieval is much harder with hidden units with
strictly sub-Gaussian tails; if the hidden prior has Gaussian tails, the
retrieval capability is determined by the number of hidden units (as in the
Hopfield model).

Bi$_2$O$_2$S is fascinating because of stereochemically active 6$s^2$ lone pair
of Bi$^{3+}$ cation, heterogeneous bonding and high mass contrast of
constituent elements. In this work, we systematically investigate the effect of
hydrostatic pressure and its implications on lattice dynamics and phonon
transport properties of Bi$_2$O$_2$S by employing first principles calculations
along with the Boltzmann transport theory. The ambient $Pnmn$ phase exhibits a
low average lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) of 1.71 W-m/K at 300 K.
We also find that Bi$_2$O$_2$S undergoes a structural phase transition from low
symmetry ($Pnmn$) to a high symmetry ($I4/mmm$) structure around 4 GPa due to
the Bi$^{3+}$ cation centering. Upon compression the lone pair activity of
Bi$^{3+}$ cation is suppressed, which increases $\kappa_l$ by nearly 3 times to
4.92 W-m/K at 5 GPa for $I4/mmm$ phase. The calculated phonon lifetimes and
Gr\""uneisen parameters show that anharmonicity reduces with increasing pressure
due to further suppression of lone pair, strengthening of intra and inter
molecular interactions, which raises the average room temperature $\kappa_l$ to
12.82 W-m/K at 20 GPa. Overall, the present study provides a comprehensive
understanding of hydrostatic pressure effects on stereochemical activity of the
Bi$^{3+}$ cation lone pair and its consequences on phonon transport properties

connectivity of heterogeneous devices with sporadic traffic and diverse
requirements in terms of latency, reliability, and bandwidth. Providing
multiple access to an increasing number of uncoordinated users and sharing the
limited resources become essential in this context. In this work, we revisit
the random access (RA) problem and exploit the continuous angular group
sparsity feature of wireless channels to propose a novel RA strategy that
provides low latency, high reliability, and massive access with limited
bandwidth resources in an all-in-one package. To this end, we first design a
reconstruction-free goal-oriented optimization problem, which only preserves
the angular information required to identify the active devices. To solve this,
we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and derive
closed-form expressions for each ADMM step. Then, we design a clustering
algorithm that assigns the users in specific groups from which we can identify
active stationary devices by their angles. For mobile devices, we propose an
alternating minimization algorithm to recover their data and their channel
gains simultaneously, which allows us to identify active mobile users.
Simulation results show significant performance gains in terms of active user
detection and false alarm probabilities as compared to state-of-the-art RA
schemes, even with limited number of preambles. Moreover, unlike prior work,
the performance of the proposed blind goal-oriented massive access does not

consistency of Peano arithmetic via a proof of consistency of Heyting
arithmetic in the 40s. In recent years, several proof-theoretic
transformations, based on G\""odel's Dialectica interpretation, have been used
systematically to extract new content from classical proofs, following a
suggestion of Kreisel. Thus, the interpretation has found new relevant
applications in several areas of mathematics and computer science. Several
authors have explained the Dialectica interpretation in categorical terms. In
our previous work, we introduced an intrinsic categorical presentation of the
Dialectica construction via a generalisation of Hofstra's work, using the
notion of G\""odel fibration and its proof-irrelevant version, a G\""odel
doctrine. The key idea is that G\""odel fibrations can be thought of as
fibrations generated by some basic elements playing the role of quantifier-free
elements. This categorification of quantifier-free elements is crucial not only
to show that our notion of G\""odel fibration is equivalent to Hofstra's
Dialectica fibration in the appropriate way, but also to show how G\""odel
doctrines embody the main logical features of the Dialectica Interpretation. To
show that, we derive the soundness of the interpretation of the implication
connective, as expounded by Troelstra, in the categorical model. This requires
extra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic logic, namely Markov
Principle and the Independence of Premise principle, as well as some choice. We
show how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting,
establishing a tight correspondence between the logical system and the
categorical framework. Finally, to complete our analysis, we characterise
categories obtained as results of the tripos-to-topos of Hyland, Johnstone and
Pitts applied to G\""odel doctrines.

The camera semantics are based on a modified EfficientNet architecture which is
trained with labeled data collected from onboard fisheye cameras. The point
clouds are associated with the closest curb segment with $L_2$-norm analysis
after projecting into the image space with the fisheye model projection. Next,
the selected points are clustered using unsupervised density-based spatial

consecutive frames they are associated with the existing curb clusters using
temporal reachability constraints. If no reachability constraints are found a
new curb cluster is formed from these new points. This ensures we can detect
multiple curbs present in road segments consisting of multiple lanes if they
are in the sensors' field of view. Finally, Delaunay filtering is applied for
outlier removal and its performance is compared to traditional RANSAC-based

can continue within the test providing extra information about their lifetime.
Moreover, one-shot devices may last for long times under normal operating
conditions, and so accelerated life tests (ALTs) may be used for inference.
ALTs relate the lifetime distribution of an unit with the stress level at which
it is tested via log-linear relationship.Then, mean lifetime of the devices are
reduced during the test by increasing the stress level and inference results on
increased stress levels can be easily extrapolated to normal operating
conditions. In particular, the step-stress ALT model increases the stress level
at pre-fixed times gradually during the life-testing experiment, which may be
specially advantageous for non-destructive one-shot devices. However, when the
number of units under test are few, outlying data may greatly influence the
parameter estimation. In this paper, we develop robust restricted estimators
based on the density power divergence (DPD) under linearly restricted

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyberthreats are a permanent concern in our modern technological world. In
the recent years, sophisticated traffic analysis techniques and anomaly
detection (AD) algorithms have been employed to face the more and more
subversive adversarial attacks. A malicious intrusion, defined as an invasive
action intending to illegally exploit private resources, manifests through
unusual data traffic and/or abnormal connectivity pattern. Despite the plethora
of statistical or signature-based detectors currently provided in the
literature, the topological connectivity component of a malicious flow is less
exploited. Furthermore, a great proportion of the existing statistical
intrusion detectors are based on supervised learning, that relies on labeled
data. By viewing network flows as weighted directed interactions between a pair
of nodes, in this paper we present a simple method that facilitate the use of
connectivity graph features in unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. We
test our methodology on real network traffic datasets and observe several
improvements over standard AD.

application to developing $\textit{in vitro}$ systems to model human

their biological similarity to the target population, and apply this analysis
to rank a series of 18 $\textit{in vitro}$ macrophage systems perturbed with a

perturbational autoencoder and apply a $k$-medoids approach to recommend a
subset of these model systems for further experimental development in order to
fully explore the space of possible perturbations. Through this use case, we
demonstrate a novel approach to model system development to generate a system

compromise of private key remain secure, and therefore offer an enhanced
compromise-resiliency for real-life applications such as digital forensics,
audit logs, and financial systems. However, the vast majority of
state-of-the-art forward-secure signatures rely on conventional intractability
assumptions and therefore are not secure against quantum computers. Hash-based
signatures (HBS) (e.g., XMSS) can offer forward-secure post-quantum security.
However, they are efficient only for a pre-defined number of messages to be
signed and incur high key generation overhead, highly expensive signing, and
large signature sizes for an increasing number of messages. It is an open
problem to develop quantum-safe forward-secure signatures that are efficient
and practical with a signing capability scalable to their security parameters.
  In this work, we propose a new series of post-quantum signatures that we call
FROG (Forward-secuRe pOst-quantum siGnature). Unlike HBS alternatives, FROG can
achieve highly computational efficient signatures with sub-linear key/signature
sizes and (practically) unbounded signing capability. This is achieved by
transforming suitable post-quantum signatures into forward-secure settings via
MMM constructions. We investigated the transformation of prominent post-quantum
secure signatures such as Dilithium, WOTS, and BLISS with MMM. Our experiments
indicate that FROG outperforms XMSS for the vast majority (if not all for a
large number of messages) of performance metrics. We also discuss one-time
variants of these base signature schemes that can push the performance of FROG
to the edge. Overall, FROG shows a better performance than the existing
alternatives with forward-security and therefore is an ideal alternative for
the standardization efforts for forward-secure post-quantum signatures.

of only products of Pauli $\hat z$ operators (Ising form) is proven to be
efficient in near term quantum computing algorithms. This approach requires
extra unitary transformations to rotate the state of interest so that the
measurement of a fragment's Ising form would be equivalent to measurement of
the fragment for the unrotated state. These extra rotations allow one to
perform a fewer number of measurements by grouping more terms into the
measurable fragments with a lower overall estimator variance. However, previous
estimations of the number of measurements did not take into account non-unit
fidelity of quantum gates implementing the additional transformations. Through
a circuit fidelity reduction, additional transformations introduce extra
uncertainty and increase the needed number of measurements. Here we consider a
simple model for errors introduced by additional gates needed in schemes
involving grouping of commuting Pauli products. For a set of molecular
electronic Hamiltonians, we confirm that the numbers of measurements in schemes
using non-local qubit rotations are still lower than those in their local qubit
rotation counterparts, even after accounting for uncertainties introduced by

investigated using the recently obtained average magnetization interrelation,
which is given by $\langle\sigma_{0, i}\rangle=

Here, $z$ is the number of nearest neighbors, $\sigma_{0,i}$ denotes the
central spin at the $i^{th}$ site while $\sigma_{l,i}$, $l=1,2,\dots,z$, are
the nearest neighbor spins around the central spin, $K=J/(k_{B}T)$, where $J$
is the nearest neighbor coupling constant, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann's constant
and $T$ is the temperature of the system. In our investigation, inevitably we
have to make a conjecture about the three-site correlation function appearing
in the obtained relation of this paper. The conjectured form of the the three
spin correlation function is given by the relation,
$\langle\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}\rangle=a(K,H)\langle\sigma\rangle+[1-a(K,H)]\langle\sigma\rangle^{(1+\beta^{-1})}$.
Here $\beta$ denotes the critical exponent for the average magnetization and
$a(K,H)$ is a function whose behavior will be described around the critical
point with an arbitrary constant. To elucidate the relevance of the method used

an example, and the obtained susceptibility expression is seen as equivalent to
the result of the susceptibility of the conventional method. The magnetic

model-based approaches for symmetry breaking are limited to problems for which
a set of representative and easily-solvable instances is available, which is
often not the case in practical applications. This work extends the learning
framework and implementation of a model-based approach for Answer Set
Programming to overcome these limitations and address challenging problems,
such as the Partner Units Problem. In particular, we incorporate a new conflict
analysis algorithm in the Inductive Logic Programming system ILASP, redefine
the learning task, and suggest a new example generation method to scale up the
approach. The experiments conducted for different kinds of Partner Units
Problem instances demonstrate the applicability of our approach and the
computational benefits due to the first-order constraints learned.

solution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other
traditional distributed computing environments. Owing to the different sizes of
scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it
is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data
transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge
computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the
dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and
exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To
address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model
that includes shared datasets within individual and among multiple workflows
across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement
strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the
build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization
algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to
proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution
problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning-based
approach to learn the optimal strategy in the runtime stage of scientific
workflows. Through simulating heterogeneous edge-cloud computing environments,
we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of
DYM-RL-DPS. The results of our strategy can effectively reduce the data
transmission time as compared to other strategies.

$\varepsilon^{1-d}$. The solution $u=u^\varepsilon$ is required to be 1 on all

$A_*$, where $U(x)=\min\{1,|x|^{-\gamma}\}$ is the radial $p$-harmonic function

$A_*=1$ if $\tau=\infty$. In the critical window where $\tau$ is positive and

role of coherent structures, i.e., vortices and zonal flows, and their impact
on the Lagrangian statistics of particles. Computationally intensive long time
simulations following ensembles of test particles over hundreds of eddy
turnover times are considered in statistically stationary turbulent flows. The
flow topology is characterized using the Lagrangian Okubo-Weiss criterion, and
the flow can thus be split into topologically different domains. In elliptic
and hyperbolic regions, the probability density functions (pdfs) of the
residence time have self-similar algebraic decaying tails. However, in the
intermediate regions the pdfs do exhibit exponentially decaying tails.
Topologically conditioned pdfs of the Lagrangian velocity, and acceleration and
density fluctuations are likewise computed. The differences between the
classical Hasegawa-Wakatani system and its modified version are assessed and
the role of zonal flows is highlighted. The density flux spectrum which
characterizes the contributions of different length scales is studied and its
inertial scaling is found to be in agreement with predictions based on
dimensional arguments. Analyzing the angular change of particle tracers at
different time scales, corresponding to coarse grained curvature, completes the
study and the multiscale geometric statistics quantify the directional
properties of the particle motion in the different flow regimes.

dominated the race in solving various cognitive tasks. The restricted training
pattern in the standard BP requires end-to-end error propagation, causing large
memory cost and prohibiting model parallelization. Existing local training
methods aim to resolve the training obstacle by completely cutting off the
backward path between modules and isolating their gradients to reduce memory
cost and accelerate the training process. These methods prevent errors from
flowing between modules and hence information exchange, resulting in inferior
performance. This work proposes a novel local training algorithm, BackLink,
which introduces inter-module backward dependency and allows errors to flow
between modules. The algorithm facilitates information to flow backward along
with the network. To preserve the computational advantage of local training,
BackLink restricts the error propagation length within the module. Extensive
experiments performed in various deep convolutional neural networks demonstrate
that our method consistently improves the classification performance of local
training algorithms over other methods. For example, in ResNet32 with 16 local
modules, our method surpasses the conventional greedy local training method by
4.00\% and a recent work by 1.83\% in accuracy on CIFAR10, respectively.
Analysis of computational costs reveals that small overheads are incurred in
GPU memory costs and runtime on multiple GPUs. Our method can lead up to a 79\%
reduction in memory cost and 52\% in simulation runtime in ResNet110 compared
to the standard BP. Therefore, our method could create new opportunities for

true and estimated values of aerodynamic effects. Simplified Affine Disturbance
Feedback is employed for control parameterization to guarantee convexity, which
we then integrate with a SMPC to achieve sufficient and non-conservative
control signals. We demonstrate our system to improve the cumulative tracking
errors by at least 66% with unknown and diverse aerodynamic forces compared

complexity of these systems is often described in terms of its fractality,
however, the network topology plays a relevant role behind the system's
biological function. Therefore, here we considered a structural analysis of
bio-inspired spatial systems based on fractal and network approaches in order
to identify the features that could make tree-like morphologies better at
exploring space under limited matter, energy and information. We considered
connected clusters of particles in two-dimensions: the Ballistic and
Diffusion-Limited Aggregation stochastic fractals, the Viscek and Hexaflake
deterministic fractals, and the Kagome and Hexagonal lattices. We characterized
their structure in terms of the range (linear extension), coverage
(plane-filling), cost (assembly connections), configurational complexity (local
connectivity), and efficiency (network communication). We found that tree-like
systems have a lower configurational complexity and an invariant structural
cost for different fractal dimensions, however, they are also fragile and
inefficient. Nevertheless, this efficiency can become similar to that of an
hexagonal lattice, at a similar cost, by considering euclidean connectivity
beyond first neighbors. These results provide relevant insights into the
interplay between the morphological and network properties of complex spatial

interactions obey McKean-Vlasov diffusion equations in the mean-field limit.
These equations are prone to blowups: for a strong enough interaction coupling,
the mean-field rate of interaction diverges in finite time with a finite
fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously, thereby marking a macroscopic
synchronous event. Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is
the key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in
mean-field neural models. However, such a resolution is hindered by the
first-passage nature of the mean-field interaction in classically considered
dynamics. Here, we introduce a delayed Poissonian variation of the classical
integrate-and-fire dynamics for which blowups are analytically well defined in
the mean-field limit. Albeit fundamentally nonlinear, we show that this delayed
Poissonian dynamics can be transformed into a noninteracting linear dynamics
via a deterministic time change. We specify this time change as the solution of
a nonlinear, delayed integral equation via renewal analysis of first-passage
problems. This formulation also reveals that the fraction of simultaneously
spiking neurons can be determined via a self-consistent,
probability-conservation principle about the time-changed linear dynamics. We
utilize the proposed framework in a companion paper to show analytically the
existence of singular mean-field dynamics with sustained synchrony for large
enough interaction coupling.

introduce a frequency-based loss in addition to the traditional spatial
reconstruction loss and adversarial loss. In particular, we introduce an
effective reconstruction loss both in the spatial and frequency domain to
reduce the chessboard effect and ripples in the reconstructed image. Extensive

Stokes while studying the asymptotic behaviour of the Airy function. R. B.
Dingle proposed a set of rules for locating Stokes lines and continuing
asymptotic expansions across them. Included among these rules is the ""final
main rule"" stating that half the discontinuity in form occurs on reaching the
Stokes line, and half on leaving it the other side. M. V. Berry demonstrated
that, if an asymptotic expansion is terminated just before its numerically
least term, the transition between two different asymptotic forms across a
Stokes line is effected smoothly and not discontinuously as in the conventional
interpretation of the Stokes phenomenon. On a Stokes line, in accordance with
Dingle's final main rule, Berry's law predicts a multiplier of $\frac{1}{2}$
for the emerging small exponentials. In this paper, we consider two closely
related asymptotic expansions in which the multipliers of exponentially small
contributions may no longer obey Dingle's rule: their values can differ from
$\frac{1}{2}$ on a Stokes line and can be non-zero only on the line itself.
This unusual behaviour of the multipliers is a result of a sequence of
higher-order Stokes phenomena. We show that these phenomena are rapid but
smooth transitions in the remainder terms of a series of optimally truncated
hyperasymptotic re-expansions. To this end, we verify a conjecture due to C. J.

of the regularization parameter on the sparsity of the regularized solutions.
We establish a characterization of the sparsity under the transform matrix of
the solution. When the fidelity term has a special structure and the transform
matrix coincides with a identity matrix, the resulting characterization can be
taken as a regularization parameter choice strategy with which the
regularization problem has a solution having a sparsity of a certain level. We
study choices of the regularization parameter so that the regularization term
alleviates the ill-posedness and promote sparsity of the resulting regularized
solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate that choices of the regularization
parameters can balance the sparsity of the solutions of the regularization
problem and its approximation to the minimizer of the fidelity function.

gate-voltage maneuvering, suggesting the relevance of charge-arrangements. It
may also be suppressed by either; temperature, non-ohmic field, or exposure to

disorder. Analysis of these findings highlights several issues that challenge

SOD methods typically demand large quantity of training images being thoroughly
annotated at pixel-level. The laborious and time-consuming manual annotation
has become a real bottleneck in various practical scenarios. On the other hand,
current unsupervised RGB-D SOD methods still heavily rely on handcrafted
feature representations. This inspires us to propose in this paper a deep
unsupervised RGB-D saliency detection approach, which requires no manual
pixel-level annotation during training. It is realized by two key ingredients
in our training pipeline. First, a depth-disentangled saliency update (DSU)
framework is designed to automatically produce pseudo-labels with iterative
follow-up refinements, which provides more trustworthy supervision signals for
training the saliency network. Second, an attentive training strategy is
introduced to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, by properly re-weighting
to highlight the more reliable pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in tackling the
challenging unsupervised RGB-D SOD scenarios. Moreover, our approach can also
be adapted to work in fully-supervised situation. Empirical studies show the
incorporation of our approach gives rise to notably performance improvement in

surprisingly, this may not hold if group performance levels vary widely; in

hence $\beta X=X$. We also prove that if $\upsilon X$, the Hewitt

observe that every submaximal Hausdorff space is pseudo-finite. It turns out
that if $\upsilon X$ is a submaximal space, then $X$ is a pseudo-finite
$\mu$-compact space.
  An example is given which shows that $X$ may be submaximal but $\upsilon X$
may not be submaximal. Given a topological space $(X,{\mathcal T})$, the
collection of all locally closed subsets of $X$ forms a base for a topology on
$X$ which is denotes by ${\mathcal T_l}$. We study some topological properties

$(X,{\mathcal T_l})$ is discrete if and only if $(X,{\mathcal T})$ is a

target of deepfake detection problem is to represent natural faces and fake
faces at the representation space discriminatively, and it reminds us whether
we could optimize the feature extraction procedure at the representation space
through constraining intra-class consistence and inter-class inconsistence to
bring the intra-class representations close and push the inter-class

learning, we tackle the deepfake detection problem through learning the
invariant representations of both classes and propose a novel real-centric
consistency learning method. We constraint the representation from both the
sample level and the feature level. At the sample level, we take the procedure
of deepfake synthesis into consideration and propose a novel forgery
semantical-based pairing strategy to mine latent generation-related features.
At the feature level, based on the centers of natural faces at the

to simulate the potential marginal features. Besides, a hard negative fusion
method is designed to improve the discrimination of negative marginal features
with the help of supervised contrastive margin loss we developed. The

MobileNet V2 with Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) performs better than any other
Transfer Learning methods, with a perfect accuracy of 99% in classification of
images as with or without occlusion and if with occlusion, then the type of
occlusion. In parallel, identifying the Region of interest from the device
captured image is done. This extracted Region of interest is utilised in face
identification. Such a face identification process is done using the ResNet
model with its Caffe implementation. To reduce the execution time, after the
face occlusion type was recognized the person was searched to confirm their
face image in the registered database. The face label of the person obtained
from both simultaneous processes was verified for their matching score. If the
matching score was above 90, the recognized label of the person was logged into
a file with their name, type of mask, date, and time of recognition.
MobileNetV2 is a lightweight framework which can also be used in embedded or
IoT devices to perform real time detection and identification in suspicious
areas of investigations using CCTV footages. When MobileNetV2 was combined with
GRU, a reliable accuracy was obtained. The data provided in the paper belong to

  Text-to-Speech","Accepted to NeurIPS 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Style transfer for out-of-domain (OOD) speech synthesis aims to generate
speech samples with unseen style (e.g., speaker identity, emotion, and prosody)
derived from an acoustic reference, while facing the following challenges: 1)
The highly dynamic style features in expressive voice are difficult to model
and transfer; and 2) the TTS models should be robust enough to handle diverse
OOD conditions that differ from the source data. This paper proposes
GenerSpeech, a text-to-speech model towards high-fidelity zero-shot style
transfer of OOD custom voice. GenerSpeech decomposes the speech variation into
the style-agnostic and style-specific parts by introducing two components: 1) a
multi-level style adaptor to efficiently model a large range of style
conditions, including global speaker and emotion characteristics, and the local
(utterance, phoneme, and word-level) fine-grained prosodic representations; and
2) a generalizable content adaptor with Mix-Style Layer Normalization to
eliminate style information in the linguistic content representation and thus
improve model generalization. Our evaluations on zero-shot style transfer
demonstrate that GenerSpeech surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of
audio quality and style similarity. The extension studies to adaptive style
transfer further show that GenerSpeech performs robustly in the few-shot data
setting. Audio samples are available at https://GenerSpeech.github.io/

Therefore, we draw inspiration from the anatomical structure of the finger,
proposing a soft actuator with bi-direction tunable stiffness property (BTSA).
BTSA is composed of air-tendon hybrid actuation (ATA) and bone-like structure
(BLS). The bending stiffness can be tuned by ATA from 0.2 N/mm to 0.7 N/mm,
about a magnification of 3.5 times. The lateral stiffness with BLS is enhanced

stiffness can be tuned decoupling within a certain range of stiffness (e.g.
from 0.35 N/mm to 0.46 when the bending angle is 45 deg). The BLS is designed
according to a simplified stiffness analysis model. And a lost-wax based
fabrication method is proposed to ensure the airtightness. The experiments
about fingertip force, bending stiffness, and lateral stiffness are conducted

real-world games involving imperfect information and sequential plays. The
Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as a natural
solution concept for multi-player general-sum IIEFGs. However, existing
algorithms for finding an EFCE require full feedback from the game, and it
remains open how to efficiently learn the EFCE in the more challenging bandit
feedback setting where the game can only be learned by observations from
repeated playing.
  This paper presents the first sample-efficient algorithm for learning the
EFCE from bandit feedback. We begin by proposing $K$-EFCE -- a more generalized
definition that allows players to observe and deviate from the recommended
actions for $K$ times. The $K$-EFCE includes the EFCE as a special case at
$K=1$, and is an increasingly stricter notion of equilibrium as $K$ increases.
We then design an uncoupled no-regret algorithm that finds an
$\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K}/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations in the
full feedback setting, where $X_i$ and $A_i$ are the number of information sets
and actions for the $i$-th player. Our algorithm works by minimizing a
wide-range regret at each information set that takes into account all possible
recommendation histories. Finally, we design a sample-based variant of our
algorithm that learns an $\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K+1}/\varepsilon^2)$ episodes of play
in the bandit feedback setting. When specialized to $K=1$, this gives the first
sample-efficient algorithm for learning EFCE from bandit feedback.

mislead agents to take wrong actions. The Mean-Field Actor-Critic reinforcement
learning (MFAC) is well-known in the multi-agent field since it can effectively
handle a scalability problem. However, it is sensitive to state perturbations
that can significantly degrade the team rewards. This work proposes a Robust
Mean-field Actor-Critic reinforcement learning (RoMFAC) that has two
innovations: 1) a new objective function of training actors, composed of a
\emph{policy gradient function} that is related to the expected cumulative
discount reward on sampled clean states and an \emph{action loss function} that
represents the difference between actions taken on clean and adversarial
states; and 2) a repetitive regularization of the action loss, ensuring the
trained actors to obtain excellent performance. Furthermore, this work proposes
a game model named a State-Adversarial Stochastic Game (SASG). Despite the Nash
equilibrium of SASG may not exist, adversarial perturbations to states in the
RoMFAC are proven to be defensible based on SASG. Experimental results show
that RoMFAC is robust against adversarial perturbations while maintaining its

vehicle-based wireless network, subject to imperfect channel state information

communicates with a destination node $(D)$ through a decode-and-forward relay
$(R)$, in the presence of two wiretappers $\left(E_{1},E_{2}\right)$
independently trying to compromise the two hops. Furthermore, the transmit
nodes $\left(S,R\right) $ have a single transmit antenna, while the receivers
$\left(R,D,E_{1},E_{2}\right) $ are equipped with multiple receive antennas.
Based on the per-hop signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and correlated secrecy
capacities' statistics, a closed-form expression for the secrecy intercept

Additionally, asymptotic expressions are revealed for two scenarios, namely (i)
mobile nodes with imperfect CSI and (ii) static nodes with perfect CSI. The
results show that a zero secrecy diversity order is manifested for the first
scenario, due to the presence of a ceiling value of the average SNR, while the
IP drops linearly at high average SNR in the second one, where the achievable
diversity order depends on the fading parameters and number of antennas of the
legitimate links/nodes. Furthermore, for static nodes, the system can be
castigated by a $15$ dB secrecy loss at IP$=3\times10^{-3},$ when the CSI
imperfection power raises from $0$ to $10^{-3}$. Lastly, the higher the
legitimate nodes' speed, carrier frequency, delay, and/or relay's decoding
threshold SNR, the worse is the system's secrecy. Monte Carlo simulations

dimensions by generalizing the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the
SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike the conventional two-component
case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction of
eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range
order. These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous
condensation of multicomponent $\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in
the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact
eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry
of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert
subspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing
eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve
as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of
ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we
show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the
Hubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This
partial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly
break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the
integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization
caused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal
long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the
multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel
out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models
unveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions,

GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the
availability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that
reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images
data. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the
performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications
of GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images.
The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures
used in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies
used CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47),
the experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available

reported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have
great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of

resolution in the full field of view, at the cost of low frame rate (FR) and
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In our previous studies, compressed sensing
based synthetic transmit aperture (CS-STA) and minimal l2-norm least squares
(LS-STA) methods were proposed to recover the complete STA dataset from fewer
Hadamard-encoded plane wave (PW) transmissions. Results demonstrated that,
compared with STA imaging, CS/LS-STA can maintain the high resolution of STA
and improve the contrast in the deep region with increased FR. However, these
methods would introduce errors to the recovered STA datasets and subsequently
produce severe artifacts to the beamformed images. Recently, we discovered that
the theoretical explanation for the error introduced in the LS-STA-based
recovery is that LS-STA method neglects the null space component of the real
STA data. To deal with this problem, we propose to train a convolutional neural
network (CNN) under the null space learning framework (to estimate the missing
null space component) for high-accuracy recovery of the STA dataset from fewer
Hadamard-encoded PW transmissions. The mapping between the low-quality STA
dataset (recovered using the LS-STA method) and the corresponding high-quality
STA dataset (obtained using full Hadamard-encoded STA imaging, HE-STA) was
learned from phantom and in vivo samples. The performance of the proposed
CNN-STA method was compared with the LS-STA, STA, and HE-STA methods, in terms
of visual quality, NRMSE, gCNR, and FWHM. The results demonstrate that the
proposed method can improve the recovery accuracy of the STA datasets and
therefore effectively suppress the artifacts presented in the images obtained
using the LS-STA method. In addition, the proposed method can maintain the high
lateral resolution of STA with fewer PW transmissions, as LS-STA does.

Weyl-invariant scalar-tensor (WIST) theory of gravity. In addition to being
Weyl-invariant the theory is U(1)-symmetric and has a conserved global charge.
The entire cosmic background evolution is accounted for by a complex scalar
field that evolves in the static `comoving' frame. Its (dimensional) modulus
$\chi$ regulates the dynamics of masses and the apparent space expansion.
Cosmological redshift is essentially due to the cosmic evolution of the Rydberg
constant in the comoving frame. The temporal evolution of $\chi$ is analogous
to that of a point particle in the presence of a central potential $V(\chi)$.
The scalar field sources the spacetime curvature; as such it can account for
the (cosmological) Dark Sector. An interplay between the energy density of
radiation and that of the kinetic energy associated with the phase $\alpha$ of
the scalar field (which are of opposite signs) results in a classical
non-singular stable and nearly-symmetric bouncing dynamics deep in the
radiation-dominated era. This encompasses the observed redshifting era which
preceded by a `bounce' that follows a blushifting era. The model is essentially

in probability and statistics, which can be applied to solve many central
problems of statistical inference. There are many existing independence and CI
measures defined from diverse principles and concepts. In this paper, the 16
independence measures and 16 CI measures were reviewed and then evaluated with
simulated and real data. For the independence measures, eight simulated data
were generating from normal distribution, normal and Archimedean copula
functions to compare the measures in bivariate or multivariate, linear or
nonlinear settings. Two UCI dataset, including the heart disease data and the
wine quality data, were used to test the power of the independence measures in
real conditions. For the CI measures, two simulated data with normal
distribution and Gumbel copula, and one real data (the Beijing air data) were
utilized to test the CI measures in prespecified linear or nonlinear setting
and real scenario. From the experimental results, we found that most of the
measures work well on the simulated data by presenting the right monotonicity
of the simulations. However, the independence and CI measures were
differentiated on much complex real data respectively and only a few can be
considered as working well with reference to domain knowledge. We also found
that the measures tend to be separated into groups based on the similarity of
the behaviors of them in each setting and in general. According to the
experiments, we recommend CE as a good choice for both independence and CI
measure. This is also due to its rigorous distribution-free definition and
consistent nonparametric estimator.

substitute the problem of guessing the ""correct"" form of the asset price

number of price statistical moments determined by statistical moments of the
market trade value and volume during {\Delta}. We extend the well-known
definition of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) presented more than 30
years ago and introduce market price n-th statistical moments as n-th power
volume weighted average. That results in zero correlations between time-series
of n-th power of the trade volume and price during {\Delta}, but doesn't cause
statistical independence between trade volume and price. As example we derive
expression for correlation between time-series of the market price and squares
of the trade volume. The market trades records during {\Delta} allow assess
only finite number of statistical moments. Approximations of the price
characteristic function that reproduce first m price statistical moments
generate approximations of the market-based price probability. That approach
unifies description of the asset price, price indices, returns, inflation and
their volatilities. Market-based approach impacts the asset pricing models and
uncovers hidden vital fault of the widely used hedging tool - Value-at-Risk.
Our approach doesn't simplify the random price puzzle but establishes direct
economic ties and relations between asset pricing, market stochasticity and
economic theory. Description of the market-based price and returns volatility,

of the epidemic with reinfection. We obtain the important thresholds $R_0$ (the
basic reproduction number) and Rc (a threshold less than one). Our
investigations show that when $R_0 > 1$, the system has an endemic equilibrium,
which is globally asymptotically stable. When $R_c < R_0 < 1$, the epidemic
system exhibits bistable dynamics. That is, the system has backward bifurcation
and the disease cannot be eradicated. In order to eradicate the disease, we
must ensure that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than $R_c$. The
basic reinfection number is obtained to measure the reinfection force, which
turns out to be a new tipping point for disease dynamics. We also give
definition of robustness, a new concept to measure the difficulty of completely
eliminating the disease for a bistable epidemic system. Numerical simulations
are carried out to verify the conclusions.

to 'large' data sets. In particular, we focus on random effect models which are

expressible only as an analytically intractable integral. Common techniques for
fitting such models to data include, for example, the use of numerical
approximations for the integral, or a Bayesian data augmentation approach.
However, as the size of the data set increases (i.e. the number of individuals
increases), these computational tools may become computationally infeasible. We
present an efficient Bayesian model-fitting approach, whereby we initially
sample from the posterior distribution of a smaller subsample of the data,
before correcting this sample to obtain estimates of the posterior distribution
of the full dataset, using an importance sampling approach. We consider several
practical issues, including the subsampling mechanism, computational
efficiencies (including the ability to parallelise the algorithm) and combining
subsampling estimates using multiple subsampled datasets. We demonstrate the
approach in relation to individual heterogeneity capture-recapture models. We
initially demonstrate the feasibility of the approach via simulated data before
considering a challenging real dataset of approximately 30,000 guillemots, and

boundary $\partial M$. Let $\rho$ be a defining function of $M$ and $\sigma

inequality corresponding to the embedding of $W^{1,2}(\rho^{1-2 \sigma}, M)
\hookrightarrow L^{p}(\partial M)$, where $p=\frac{2 n}{n-2 \sigma}$. More
precisely, under some assumptions on the manifold, we prove that there exists a
constant $B>0$ such that, for all $u \in W^{1,2}(\rho^{1-2\sigma}, M)$, $$
\Big(\int_{\partial M}|u|^{p} \,\ud s_{g}\Big)^{2/p} \leq \mu^{-1} \int_{M}
\rho^{1-2 \sigma}|\nabla_{g} u|^{2} \,\ud v_{g}+B \Big|\int_{\partial M}
|u|^{p-2}u \,\ud s_{g}\Big|^{2/(p-1)}. $$ This inequality is sharp in the sense
that $\mu^{-1}$ cannot be replaced by any smaller constant. Moreover, unlike
the classical Sobolev inequality, $\mu^{-1}$ does not depend on $n$ and
$\sigma$ only, but depends on the manifold.

are interesting for fundamental research as well as practical applications.
Recently, the topological state of 2D Weyl half-semimetal (WHS) was proposed,
which hosts fully spin polarized Weyl points robust against spin-orbit coupling
in a 2D ferromagnetic system, and single-layer PtCl$_3$ was predicted as a
platform for realizing this state. Here, we perform an extensive search of 2D
PtCl$_3$ structures, by using the particle swarm optimization technique and
density functional theory calculation. We show that the desired PtCl$_3$ phase
corresponds to the most stable one at its stoichiometry. The 2D structure also
possesses good thermal stability up to 600 K. We suggest SnS$_2$ as a substrate
for the growth of 2D PtCl$_3$, which has excellent lattice matching and
preserves the WHS state in PtCl$_3$. We find that uniaxial strains along the
zigzag direction maintain the WHS state, whereas small strains along the
armchair direction drives a topological phase transition from the WHS to a
quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator phase. Furthermore, we study bilayer
PtCl$_3$ and show that the stacking configuration has strong impact on the
magnetism and the electronic band structure. Particularly, the $AA'$ stacked
bilayer PtCl$_3$ realizes an interesting topological state -- the 2D
antiferromagnetic mirror Chern insulator, which has a pair of topological
gapless edge bands. Our work provides guidance for the experimental realization
of 2D PtCl$_3$ and will facilitate the study of 2D magnetic topological states,
including WHS, QAH insulator, and magnetic mirror Chern insulator states.

dynamics.
  Such type switches can eg.\ be motivated from biology, where 'phenotypic
switching' is common among micro-organisms. Our framework includes as special

Process with dormancy, CPD), and the Contact Process in a randomly evolving
environment (CPREE) introduced by Broman (2007). The 'standard' multi-type
Contact Process (without type-switching) can also be recovered as a limiting
case.
  After constructing the process from a graphical representation, we establish
several basic properties that are mostly analogous to the classical Contact
Process. We then provide couplings between several variants of the system,
which in particular yield the existence of a phase transition. Further, we
investigate the effect of the switching parameters on the critical value of the
system by providing rigorous bounds obtained from the coupling arguments as

complex models in high-stakes settings, it becomes critical to ensure that the
quality of the resulting explanations is consistently high across various
population subgroups including the minority groups. For instance, it should not
be the case that explanations associated with instances belonging to a
particular gender subgroup (e.g., female) are less accurate than those
associated with other genders. However, there is little to no research that
assesses if there exist such group-based disparities in the quality of the
explanations output by state-of-the-art explanation methods. In this work, we
address the aforementioned gaps by initiating the study of identifying
group-based disparities in explanation quality. To this end, we first outline
the key properties which constitute explanation quality and where disparities
can be particularly problematic. We then leverage these properties to propose a
novel evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the
quality of explanations output by state-of-the-art methods. Using this
framework, we carry out a rigorous empirical analysis to understand if and when
group-based disparities in explanation quality arise. Our results indicate that
such disparities are more likely to occur when the models being explained are
complex and highly non-linear. In addition, we also observe that certain post
hoc explanation methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are more likely to
exhibit the aforementioned disparities. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to highlight and study the problem of group-based disparities in
explanation quality. In doing so, our work sheds light on previously unexplored
ways in which explanation methods may introduce unfairness in real world
decision making.

spectral statistics (LSS) of large-dimensional sample covariance matrix when
the population covariance matrices are not uniformly bounded, which is a
nontrivial extension of the Bai-Silverstein theorem (BST) (2004). The latter
has strongly stimulated the development of high-dimensional statistics,
especially the application of random matrix theory to statistics. However, the
assumption of uniform boundedness of the population covariance matrices is
found strongly limited to the applications of BST. The aim of this paper is to
remove the blockages to the applications of BST. The new CLT, allows the spiked
eigenvalues to exist and tend to infinity. It is interesting to note that the
roles of either spiked eigenvalues or the bulk eigenvalues or both of the two
are dominating in the CLT.
  Moreover, the results are checked by simulation studies with various
population settings. The CLT for LSS is then applied for testing the hypothesis
that a covariance matrix $ \bSi $ is equal to an identity matrix. For this, the
asymptotic distributions for the corrected likelihood ratio test (LRT) and
Nagao's trace test (NT) under alternative are derived, and we also propose the
asymptotic power of LRT and NT under certain alternatives.

depends on the evolution of the system variables and their probability density
function, and is expressed through system and environmental contributions. The

disturbance mimicking a measuring device. Under the thermalising influence of
time independent coupling to the environment, the mean rate of entropy
production vanishes asymptotically, indicating equilibrium. In contrast, a

increasing research attention as it can significantly reduce the annotation
cost. However, labels from weak supervision can be noisy, and the high capacity
of DNNs enables them to easily overfit the label noise, resulting in poor
generalization. Recent methods leverage self-training to build noise-resistant
models, in which a teacher trained under weak supervision is used to provide
highly confident labels for teaching the students. Nevertheless, the teacher
derived from such frameworks may have fitted a substantial amount of noise and
therefore produce incorrect pseudo-labels with high confidence, leading to
severe error propagation. In this work, we propose Meta Self-Refinement (MSR),

Grand unified theories, with the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale of $U(1)$

establish the relationship between the mutual influence matrix of actors and a
set of similarity matrices induced by their associated attributes. This model
is able to explain the heterogeneous structure of the mutual influence matrix
by extending the commonly used spatial autoregressive model while allowing it
to change with time. To facilitate making inferences with MIR, we establish
parameter estimation, weight matrices selection and model testing.
Specifically, we employ the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation method to
estimate unknown regression coefficients, and demonstrate that the resulting
estimator is asymptotically normal without imposing the normality assumption
and while allowing the number of similarity matrices to diverge. In addition,
an extended BIC-type criterion is introduced for selecting relevant matrices
from the divergent number of similarity matrices. To assess the adequacy of the
proposed model, we further propose an influence matrix test and develop a novel
approach in order to obtain the limiting distribution of the test. Finally, we
extend the model to accommodate endogenous weight matrices, exogenous
covariates, and both individual and time fixed effects, to broaden the
usefulness of MIR. The simulation studies support our theoretical findings, and
a real example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed MIR
model.

types of influence parameters; one measures the magnitude of influence that
each node exerts on others (outward influence), while we introduce a new
parameter to quantify the receptivity of each node to being influenced by
others (inward influence). Accordingly, these two types of influence measures
naturally classify all nodes into four quadrants (high inward and high outward,
low inward and high outward, low inward and low outward, high inward and low
outward). To demonstrate our four-quadrant clustering method in practice, we
apply the quasi-maximum likelihood approach to estimate the influence
parameters, and we show the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators.
In addition, score tests are proposed to examine the homogeneity of the two
types of influence parameters. To improve the accuracy of inferences about
nodal influences, we introduce a Bayesian information criterion that selects
the optimal influence model. The usefulness of the IONI model and the

technologies (FPT) have been met with increasing controversy. Several states
and cities in the U.S. have banned the use of facial recognition by law
enforcement and governments, but FPT are still being developed and used in a
wide variety of contexts where they primarily are regulated by state biometric
information privacy laws. Among these laws, the 2008 Illinois Biometric
Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has generated a significant amount of
litigation. Yet, with most BIPA lawsuits reaching settlements before there have
been meaningful clarifications of relevant technical intricacies and legal
definitions, there remains a great degree of uncertainty as to how exactly this
law applies to FPT. What we have found through applications of BIPA in FPT
litigation so far, however, points to potential disconnects between technical
and legal communities. This paper analyzes what we know based on BIPA court
proceedings and highlights these points of tension: areas where the technical
operationalization of BIPA may create unintended and undesirable incentives for
FPT development, as well as areas where BIPA litigation can bring to light the
limitations of solely technical methods in achieving legal privacy values.
These factors are relevant for (i) reasoning about biometric information
privacy laws as a governing mechanism for FPT, (ii) assessing the potential
harms of FPT, and (iii) providing incentives for the mitigation of these harms.
By illuminating these considerations, we hope to empower courts and lawmakers
to take a more nuanced approach to regulating FPT and developers to better
understand privacy values in the current U.S. legal landscape.

Existing music cover image generation services do not analyze tracks

music covers as vector images that reflect the music and consist of simple
geometric objects, we suggest a GAN-based algorithm called CoverGAN. The
assessment of resulting images is based on their correspondence to the music

evaluated in terms of the correspondence of the generated cover images to the

affect significantly the background evolution during the inflationary era,
which is solely controlled by $R^2$ gravity. However, the due to the presence
of the Chern-Simons term, the tensor perturbations are directly affected, and
our aim is to reveal the extent of effects of the Chern-Simons term on the
gravitational waves modes, for both the axion models. We aim to produce
analytical descriptions of the primordial tensor modes behavior, and thus we
solve analytically the evolution equations of the tensor modes, for a nearly de
Sitter primordial evolution controlled by the $R^2$ gravity. We focus the
analytical study on superhorizon and subhorizon modes. For the misalignment
model, we were able to produce analytic solutions for both the subhorizon and
superhorizon modes, in which case we found the behavior of the circular

is strongly chiral. For the kinetic axion model though, analytic solutions are

evaluate Central Processing Unit Scheduling algorithms which are based on
different properties of the system. Round Robin is known to be the most
recurrent pre-emptive algorithm used in an environment where processes are
allotted a unit of time and multiprocessing operating systems. In this paper, a
reformed variation of the Round Robin algorithm has been introduced to minimise
the completion time, turnaround time, waiting time and number of context
switches that results in the better performance of the system. The proposed
work consists of calculation of priority on the basis of the difference between
time spent in ready upto the moment and arrival time of the process, to ease up
the burden on the ready queue. We have also evaluated the performance of the
proposed approach on different datasets and measured the different scheduling

inspired by adversarial transferability, we propose a new type of black-box NLP
adversarial attack that an attacker can choose a similar domain and transfer
the adversarial examples to the target domain and cause poor performance in
target model. Based on domain adaptation theory, we then propose a defensive
strategy, called Learn2Weight, which trains to predict the weight adjustments
for a target model in order to defend against an attack of similar-domain
adversarial examples. Using Amazon multi-domain sentiment classification
datasets, we empirically show that Learn2Weight is effective against the attack
compared to standard black-box defense methods such as adversarial training and
defensive distillation. This work contributes to the growing literature on

these hidden sectors coupled to the visible sector, is given and the
implications of such couplings on physics in the visible sector are
investigated. Thus the analysis considers $n$ number of hidden sectors where
the visible sector couples only to hidden sector 1, while the latter couples
also to hidden sector 2, and the hidden sector 2 couples to hidden sector 3 and
so on. A set of successively feeble couplings of the hidden sectors to the
visible sector are generated in such a set up. In general each of these sectors
live in a different heat bath. We develop a closed form set of coupled
Boltzmann equations for the correlated evolution of the temperatures and number
densities of each of the heat baths. We then apply the formalism to a
simplified model with scalar portals between the different sectors. Predictions
related to dark matter direct detection experiments and future CMB probes of

explain why over-parameterized models often show high generalization ability.
It is known that when we use iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), which is an
algorithm to find sparse networks with high generalization ability that can be
trained from the initial weights independently, called winning tickets, the
initial large learning rate does not work well in deep neural networks such as
ResNet. However, since the initial large learning rate generally helps the
optimizer to converge to flatter minima, we hypothesize that the winning
tickets have relatively sharp minima, which is considered a disadvantage in
terms of generalization ability. In this paper, we confirm this hypothesis and
show that the PAC-Bayesian theory can provide an explicit understanding of the
relationship between LTH and generalization behavior. On the basis of our
experimental findings that flatness is useful for improving accuracy and
robustness to label noise and that the distance from the initial weights is
deeply involved in winning tickets, we offer the PAC-Bayes bound using a
spike-and-slab distribution to analyze winning tickets. Finally, we revisit
existing algorithms for finding winning tickets from a PAC-Bayesian perspective
and provide new insights into these methods.

other phenomena are often especially appealing to lay people. Therefore,
neuroscientific explanations that can affect individuals, groups, or social

field in which especially feminist scholars request more caution is the
neuroscientific examination of sex or gender differences. Feminist scholars
have described various ways in which sexist bias might be present in
neuroscientific research on sex or gender differences. In this context, they
coined the term ""neurosexism"" to describe the entanglement between
neuroscientific work and sexist ideology, and ""neurofeminism"" as a response to
that. Here, we aim to give an overview over the contemporary neurofeminist
literature. In the first part, common levels of analysis in the neurofeminist
literature are presented and the research level is explored in more detail. In
the second part, some common developments in more recent neurofeminist
scholarship are discussed. For this, we review recent publications with the aim

linear regression approach. We present experimental results which motivate
comprehensive simulation campaigns. These simulations provide valid statistical
statements and reliable forecasts of the experimental results. A profound
analytical treatment in turn supports these simulation outcomes with excellent
consistency. One important achievement therein is a general analytical
expression for the estimate's error, not only limited to the two particular
weighing schemes presented. It turns out that combined measurements allow to
estimate the weight of mass elements with an accuracy that under-runs by orders
of magnitude the resolution of the scale used. As the error depends on the

is how to best transfer knowledge learned in one environment to another, where
shifting constraints and human preferences render adaptation challenging. A
central challenge remains that often, it is difficult (perhaps even impossible)
to capture the full complexity of the deployment environment, and therefore the
desired tasks, at training time. Consequently, the representation, or
abstraction, of the tasks the human hopes for the robot to perform in one
environment may be misaligned with the representation of the tasks that the
robot has learned in another. We postulate that because humans will be the
ultimate evaluator of system success in the world, they are best suited to
communicating the aspects of the tasks that matter to the robot. Our key
insight is that effective learning from human input requires first explicitly
learning good intermediate representations and then using those representations
for solving downstream tasks. We highlight three areas where we can use this
approach to build interactive systems and offer future directions of work to
better create advanced collaborative robots.

estimating the parameters of a finite mixture distribution. It works by
introducing ""hidden"" or ""latent"" variables via Baum's auxiliary function $Q$
that allow the joint data likelihood to be expressed as a product of simple
factors. The relevance of EM has increased since the introduction of the
variational lower bound (VLB): the VLB differs from Baum's auxiliary function
only by the entropy of the PDF of the latent variables $Z$. We first present a
rederivation of the standard EM algorithm using data association ideas from the
field of multiple target tracking, using $K$-valued scalar data association
hypotheses rather than the usual binary indicator vectors. The same method is
then applied to a little known but much more general type of supervised EM
algorithm for shared kernel models, related to probabilistic radial basis
function networks. We address a number of shortcomings in the derivations that
have been published previously in this area. In particular, we give
theoretically rigorous derivations of (i) the complete data likelihood; (ii)
Baum's auxiliary function (the E-step) and (iii) the maximisation (M-step) in
the case of Gaussian shared kernel models. The subsequent algorithm, called
shared kernel EM (SKEM), is then applied to a digit recognition problem using a
novel 7-segment digit representation. Variants of the algorithm that use
different numbers of features and different EM algorithm dimensions are
compared in terms of mean accuracy and mean IoU. A simplified classifier is
proposed that decomposes the joint data PDF as a product of lower order PDFs
over non-overlapping subsets of variables. The effect of different numbers of

produce micro/nanoscale features with high precision and accuracy. However, the
use of high laser fluence to increase the ablation efficiency usually results
in unwanted effects, such as redeposition of debris, formation of recast layer
and heat-affected zone in or around the ablation craters. Here we circumvent
this limitation by exploiting a thin frost layer with a thickness of tens of
microns, which can be directly formed by the condensation of water vapor from
the air onto the exposed surface whose temperature is below the freezing point.
When femtosecond laser beam is focused onto the target surface covered with a
thin frost layer, only the local frost layer around the laser-irradiated spot
melts into water, helping to boost ablation efficiency, suppress the recast
layer and reduce the heat-affect zone, while the remaining frost layer can
prevent ablation debris from adhering to the target surface. By this
frost-assisted strategy, high-quality surface micro/nano-structures are
successfully achieved on both plane and curved surfaces at high laser fluences,
and the mechanism behind the formation of high-spatial-frequency (HSF) laser

HATSGA can be potentially used for computing reconfiguration network topologies
and, beyond that, it can be used for autonomic self-healing management
approaches where a feasible computational time is required.

thin disk accretion are investigated in the Rastall gravity. We found that the
radii of the direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring dramatically
increased as the radiation field parameter increases, but they only weakly
depend on the BH charge. Three positions of the radiation accretion disk
relative to the BH are considered, i.e., the innermost accretion disk is closed
to the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit, the photon ring of the BH,
and the event horizon of the BH. The observed images in three cases
respectively are obtained. It is found that the total observed flux is
dominated by the direct emission, the lensing ring provides a small
contribution, and the photon ring is negligible. The lensing and photon rings
could not be observed in the blurred image with the EHT resolution. Our results
suggest that the observable characteristics of the charged BH surrounded by the
thin disk accretion in the Rastall gravity depend on both the BH space-time
structure and the position of the radiating accretion disk with respect to the
BH. The research of these BH images may serve as a probe for the BH-disk
structure in M87$^{*}$ like nearby active galactic nuclei.

  detection (DECD)",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Studies on rapid change detection of large area urgently need to be extended
from 2D image to digital elevation model (DEM) due to the challenge of changes
caused by disasters. This research investigates positional uncertainty of
digital elevation change detection (DECD) caused by different degrees of DEM
complexity and DEM misregistration. Unfortunately, using three-sigma rule
(3{\sigma}R) for DECD is disturbed by accuracy of parameter estimation, which
is affected by the outliers (i.e., varied DEM) from DEM differencing samples.
Hence, to reduce the aforementioned uncertainty of DECD, we propose a new
strategy of quality assurance, adaptively censored three-sigma rule
(AC3{\sigma}R), in which with the samples censored, outliers of global DEM
differencing samples outside the standard deviations of the mean calculated by
moment estimation are iteratively removed. Compared with the 3{\sigma}R and
censored three-sigma rule (C3{\sigma}R) that is similar to AC3{\sigma}R but
without iteration for both simulation and real-world data experiments, the
proposed global AC3{\sigma}R method always exhibits the highest accuracies of
DECD in terms of both the overall accuracies 0.99967, 0.98740 and kappa
coefficients 0.99598, 0.81803 respectively, and the strongest robustness with a
large convergence interval [0, 0.30010] under the simulated maximum
registration error and most complex terrain complexity conditions.
