  Arbitrary Popularity Profiles",,,,,"cs.IT cs.IR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a generalization of the Private Information Retrieval
with Side Information (PIR-SI) problem called Popularity-Aware PIR-SI
(PA-PIR-SI). The PA-PIR-SI problem includes one or more remote servers storing
copies of a dataset of $K$ messages, and a user who knows $M$ out of $K$
messages -- the identities of which are unknown to the server -- as a prior
side information, and wishes to retrieve one of the remaining $K-M$ messages.
The goal of the user is to minimize the amount of information they must
download from the server while revealing no information about the identity of
the desired message. In contrast to PIR-SI, in PA-PIR-SI, the dataset messages
are not assumed to be equally popular. That is, given the $M$ side information
messages, each of the remaining $K-M$ messages is not necessarily equally
likely to be the message desired by the user. In this work, we focus on the
single-server setting of PA-PIR-SI, and establish lower and upper bounds on the
capacity of this setting -- defined as the maximum possible achievable download
rate. Our upper bound holds for any message popularity profile, and is the same
as the capacity of single-server PIR-SI. We prove the lower bound by presenting
a PA-PIR-SI scheme which takes a novel probabilistic approach -- carefully
designed based on the popularity profile -- to integrate two existing PIR-SI
schemes. The rate of our scheme is strictly higher than that of the only
existing PIR-SI scheme applicable to the PA-PIR-SI setting.

linearly degenerate along two straight lines in the phase plane and genuinely
nonlinear in the subdomains confined by such lines. In particular, the
characteristic speed of the first characteristic family is strictly increasing

the region below such a line. The non dissipative source term is the product of
two quantities that are transported with the two different characteristic

  The global existence of entropy weak solutions of the Cauchy problem for such
a system was established by Amadori and Shen for initial data with bounded but
possibly large total variation, under the assumption that the initial height of

  In this paper we establish the Lipschitz ${\bf L^1}$-continuous dependence of
the solutions on the initial data with a Lipschitz constant that grows
exponentially in time. The proof of the ${\bf L^1}$-stability of solutions is
based on the construction of a Lyapunov like functional equivalent to the ${\bf

and then developed by Bressan, Liu, Yang for systems of conservation laws with
genuinely nonlinear or linearly degenerate characteristic fields.

and haptic interactions than when these actions are performed individually.
However, is collaboration always superior to solo actions, or do its benefits
depend on whether collaborating individuals have different or the same roles?
To answer this question, we asked human subjects to perform virtual-reality
collaborative and individual beam transportation tasks. These tasks were
simulated in real-time by coupling the motion of a pair of hand-held robotic
manipulanda to the virtual beam using virtual spring-dampers. For the task to
be considered successful, participants had to complete it within temporal and
spatial constraints. While the visual feedback remained the same, the
underlying dynamics of the beam were altered to create two distinctive task
contexts which were determined by a moving pivot constraint. When the pivot was
placed at the center of the beam, two hands contribute to the task with
symmetric mechanical leverage (symmetric context). When the pivot was placed at
the left side of the beam, two hands contribute to the task with asymmetric
mechanical leverage (asymmetric context). Participants performed these task
contexts either individually with both hands (solo), or collaboratively by
pairing one hand with another one (dyads). We found that dyads in the
asymmetric context performed better than solos. In contrast, solos performed
the symmetric context better than dyads. Importantly, we found that two hands
took different roles in the asymmetric context for both solos and dyads. In
contrast, the contribution from each hand was statistically indistinguishable
in the symmetric context. Our findings suggest that better performance in dyads
than solos is not a general phenomenon, but rather that collaboration yields
better performance only when role specialization emerges in dyadic
interactions.

representations without supervision. This is achieved by mapping successive
views of an object onto close-by internal representations. When considering
this learning approach as a model of the development of human object
recognition, it is important to consider what visual input a toddler would
typically observe while interacting with objects. First, human vision is highly
foveated, with high resolution only available in the central region of the
field of view. Second, objects may be seen against a blurry background due to
infants' limited depth of field. Third, during object manipulation a toddler
mostly observes close objects filling a large part of the field of view due to
their rather short arms. Here, we study how these effects impact the quality of
visual representations learnt through time-contrastive learning. To this end,
we let a visually embodied agent ""play"" with objects in different locations of
a near photo-realistic flat. During each play session the agent views an object
in multiple orientations before turning its body to view another object. The
resulting sequence of views feeds a time-contrastive learning algorithm. Our
results show that visual statistics mimicking those of a toddler improve object
recognition accuracy in both familiar and novel environments. We argue that
this effect is caused by the reduction of features extracted in the background,
a neural network bias for large features in the image and a greater similarity
between novel and familiar background regions. We conclude that the embodied
nature of visual learning may be crucial for understanding the development of
human object perception.

measured transition being isolated from the other hyperfine levels holds the
promise to provide an improved determination of the Muonium Lamb shift at a
level where bound state QED recoil corrections not accessible in hydrogen could
be tested. Such a measurement will also be sensitive to new physics in the

synthesizing continuous face images from a single source image driven by a set
of conditional face motion. Previous works mainly model the face motion as
conditions with 1D or 2D representation (e.g., action units, emotion codes,
landmark), which often leads to low-quality results in some complicated
scenarios such as continuous generation and largepose transformation. To tackle
this problem, the conditions are supposed to meet two requirements, i.e.,
motion information preserving and geometric continuity. To this end, we propose
a novel representation based on a 3D geometric flow, termed facial flow, to
represent the natural motion of the human face at any pose. Compared with other
previous conditions, the proposed facial flow well controls the continuous
changes to the face. After that, in order to utilize the facial flow for face
editing, we build a synthesis framework generating continuous images with
conditional facial flows. To fully take advantage of the motion information of
facial flows, a hierarchical conditional framework is designed to combine the
extracted multi-scale appearance features from images and motion features from
flows in a hierarchical manner. The framework then decodes multiple fused
features back to images progressively. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

light-weight system is used to retrieve potentially relevant items for an input
user. These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of
recommender systems using a more complex ranking model. Since candidate
generation is the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve
a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common
approach for candidate generation is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor
(ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this
can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often
have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse

field up to 65 kOe using a SQUID magnetometer. Samples were synthesized by
three different growth methods: microwave-assisted hydrothermal, combustion
reaction and sol-gel. For all studied samples, the magnetic properties derive
from the antiferromagnetic (AF) spin clustering due to the Co2+ nearest
neighbors. At T >= 6 K, the magnetization of the Co2+ ions has a Brillouin-type
behavior, but below 6 K, it shows a notable deviation. We have shown that the
observed deviation may be derived from single-ion anisotropy (SIA) with
uniaxial symmetry. Results of fits show that the axial-SIA parameter D
(typically D = 4.4 K) is slightly larger that the bulk value D = 3.97 K. No
significant change of D has been observed as a function of the Co concentration
or the growth process. For each sample, the SIA fit gave also the effective
concentration (x) corresponding to the technical saturation value of the
magnetization. Comparison of the concentration dependence of x with predictions
based on cluster models shows an enhancement of the AF spin clustering
independent of the growth method. This is ascribed to a clamped non-random
distribution of the cobalt ions in the nanoparticles. The approach of the local
concentration (xL) has been used to quantify the observed deviation from
randomicity. Assuming a ZnO core/ Zn1-xCoxO shell nanoparticle, the thickness
of the shell has been determined from the ratio xL/x.

HST's unique capability as an absolute photometer to measure the ~0.2-1.7
$\mu$m sky surface brightness (SB) from 249,861 WFPC2, ACS, and WFC3 exposures
in ~1400 independent HST fields. SKYSURF's panchromatic dataset is designed to
constrain the discrete and diffuse UV to near-IR sky components: Zodiacal Light
(ZL; inner Solar System), Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs; outer Solar System),
Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), and the discrete plus diffuse Extragalactic
Background Light (EBL). We outline SKYSURF's methods to: (1) measure sky-SB
levels between its detected objects; (2) measure the integrated discrete EBL,
most of which comes from AB$\simeq$17-22 mag galaxies; and (3) estimate how
much diffuse light may exist in addition to the extrapolated discrete galaxy
counts. Simulations of HST WFC3/IR images with known sky-values and gradients,
realistic cosmic ray (CR) distributions, and star plus galaxy counts were
processed with nine different algorithms to measure the ""Lowest Estimated
Sky-SB"" (LES) in each image between the discrete objects. The best algorithms
recover the inserted LES values within 0.2% when there are no image gradients,
and within 0.2-0.4% when there are 5-10% gradients. SKYSURF requires
non-standard re-processing of these HST images that includes restoring the
lowest sky-level from each visit into each drizzled image. We provide a proof
of concept of our methods from the WFC3/IR F125W images, where any residual
diffuse light that HST sees in excess of the Kelsall et al. (1998) Zodiacal
model prediction does not depend on the total object flux that each image
contains. This enables us to present our first SKYSURF results on diffuse light
in Carleton et al. (2022).

deep inside scattering tissue. This requires determining a correction mask to

correction masks by optimizing various image metrics, a process that requires
capturing a prohibitively large number of images. To reduce acquisition cost,
iterative phase conjugation techniques use the observation that the desired
correction mask is an eigenvector of the tissue transmission operator. They
then determine this eigenvector via optical implementations of the power
iteration method, which require capturing orders of magnitude fewer images.
Existing iterative phase conjugation techniques assume a linear model for the
transmission of light through tissue, and thus only apply to fully-coherent
imaging systems. We extend such techniques to the incoherent case for the first
time. The fact that light emitted from different sources sums incoherently
violates the linear model and makes linear transmission operators inapplicable.
We show that, surprisingly, the non-linearity due to incoherent summation
results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration in the convergence of the phase
conjugation iteration.

near-term quantum computers. The success of variational quantum learning models

little is known about guiding principles for the construction of suitable

tools from representation theory, we show how a standard gateset can be
transformed into an equivariant gateset that respects the symmetries of the

proposed methods on two toy problems that feature a non-trivial symmetry and
observe a substantial increase in generalization performance. As our tools can
also be applied in a straightforward way to other variational problems with
symmetric structure, we show how equivariant gatesets can be used in
variational quantum eigensolvers.

problem for downlink of massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output

to the presence of multi-user interference. The weighted minimum mean-square
error (WMMSE) algorithm is a popular approach for WSR maximization. However,
its computational complexity is cubic in the number of base station (BS)
antennas, which is unaffordable when the BS is equipped with a large antenna
array. In this paper, we consider the WSR maximization problem with either a
sum-power constraint (SPC) or per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs). For the
former, we prove that any nontrivial stationary point must have a
low-dimensional subspace structure, and then propose a reduced-WMMSE (R-WMMSE)
with linear complexity by exploiting the solution structure. For the latter, we
propose a linear-complexity WMMSE approach, named PAPC-WMMSE, by using a novel
recursive design of the algorithm. Both R-WMMSE and PAPC-WMMSE have simple
closed-form updates and guaranteed convergence to stationary points. Simulation
results verify the efficacy of the proposed designs, especially the much lower

  Learning","88 pages, comments welcome",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently the surprising discovery of the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)
method by Grill et al. shows the negative term in contrastive loss can be
removed if we add the so-called prediction head to the network. This initiated
the research of non-contrastive self-supervised learning. It is mysterious why
even when there exist trivial collapsed global optimal solutions, neural
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent can still learn competitive
representations. This phenomenon is a typical example of implicit bias in deep
learning and remains little understood.
  In this work, we present our empirical and theoretical discoveries on
non-contrastive self-supervised learning. Empirically, we find that when the
prediction head is initialized as an identity matrix with only its off-diagonal
entries being trainable, the network can learn competitive representations even
though the trivial optima still exist in the training objective. Theoretically,
we present a framework to understand the behavior of the trainable, but
identity-initialized prediction head. Under a simple setting, we characterized
the substitution effect and acceleration effect of the prediction head. The
substitution effect happens when learning the stronger features in some neurons
can substitute for learning these features in other neurons through updating
the prediction head. And the acceleration effect happens when the substituted
features can accelerate the learning of other weaker features to prevent them
from being ignored. These two effects enable the neural networks to learn all
the features rather than focus only on learning the stronger features, which is
likely the cause of the dimensional collapse phenomenon. To the best of our
knowledge, this is also the first end-to-end optimization guarantee for
non-contrastive methods using nonlinear neural networks with a trainable
prediction head and normalization.

models work internally, SIBILA has been developed. SIBILA is an ensemble of
machine learning and deep learning models that applies a range of
interpretability algorithms to identify the most relevant input features. Since
the interpretability algo- rithms may not be in line with each other, a
consensus stage has been imple- mented to estimate the global attribution of
each variable to the predictions. SIBILA is containerized to be run on any
high-performance computing plat- form. Although conceived as a command-line

their contracts, specified by pre/postconditions. We follow an approach based
on constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) by which the verification problem is reduced
to the problem of checking satisfiability of a set of clauses derived from the
given program and contracts. We consider programs that manipulate algebraic
data types (ADTs) and a class of contracts specified by catamorphisms, that is,
functions defined by simple recursion schemata on the given ADTs. We show by
several examples that state-of-the-art CHC satisfiability tools are not
effective at solving the satisfiability problems obtained by direct translation
of the contracts into CHCs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a
transformation technique that removes the ADT terms from CHCs and derives new
sets of clauses that work on basic sorts only, such as integers and booleans.
Thus, when using the derived CHCs there is no need for induction rules on ADTs.
We prove that the transformation is sound, that is, if the derived set of CHCs
is satisfiable, then so is the original set. We also prove that the
transformation always terminates for the class of contracts specified by
catamorphisms. Finally, we present the experimental results obtained by an
implementation of our technique when verifying many non-trivial contracts for
ADT manipulating programs.

re-identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in real-word
applications. Several unsupervised single-target domain adaptation (STDA)
methods have recently been proposed to limit the decline in ReID accuracy
caused by the domain shift that typically occurs between source and target
video data. Given the multimodal nature of person ReID data (due to variations
across camera viewpoints and capture conditions), training a common CNN
backbone to address domain shifts across multiple target domains, can provide
an efficient solution for real-time ReID applications. Although multi-target
domain adaptation (MTDA) has not been widely addressed in the ReID literature,
a straightforward approach consists in blending different target datasets, and
performing STDA on the mixture to train a common CNN. However, this approach
may lead to poor generalization, especially when blending a growing number of
distinct target domains to train a smaller CNN.
  To alleviate this problem, we introduce a new MTDA method based on knowledge
distillation (KD-ReID) that is suitable for real-time person ReID applications.
Our method adapts a common lightweight student backbone CNN over the target
domains by alternatively distilling from multiple specialized teacher CNNs,
each one adapted on data from a specific target domain. Extensive experiments
conducted on several challenging person ReID datasets indicate that our
approach outperforms state-of-art methods for MTDA, including blending methods,
particularly when training a compact CNN backbone like OSNet. Results suggest
that our flexible MTDA approach can be employed to design cost-effective ReID
systems for real-time video surveillance applications.

emergent symmetries can be described by a topological order $M$ in one higher
dimension (i.e. by a categorical symmetry). The patterns of spontaneous
categorical symmetry breaking are classified by condensable algebras $A$ formed
by excitations in $M$. Various categorical symmetry breaking patterns can
describe spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) orders, symmetry protected
topological orders, symmetry enriched topological orders, gapless critical
points, etc., in a unified way. The local low energy properties of a state with
spontaneous categorical symmetry breaking pattern $A$ are exactly reproduced by
a 1-condensed boundary state of $M_{/A}$, where $M_{/A}$ is the topological
order obtained from $M$ by condensing $A$. The properties (such as scaling
dimensions) of a gapless state can be calculated from its corresponding
unbroken categorical symmetry $M_{/A}$ via an algebraic number theoretical
method. For example, a state with symmetry breaking pattern $A$ can be gapped
if $M_{/A}$ is trivial and must be gapless if $M_{/A}$ is non-trivial. The
relations between the condensable algebras also help us determine the structure
of the global phase diagram. For 1+1D $Z_2 \times Z_2'$ symmetry with mixed
anomaly, there is a stable continuous transition between the $Z_2$-SSB phase
and the $Z_2$-SSB phase. The critical point is the same as the $Z_4$ symmetry
breaking critical point. With $S_3$ symmetry, there are four gapped phases with
unbroken symmetries $S_3, Z_3, Z_2$, and $Z_1$. We find a duality between two
transitions $S_3$ to $ Z_1$ and $Z_3$ to $Z_2$. The gapped and gapless states
for 1+1D bosonic systems with anomalous $S_3$ symmetries are obtained as well.

parameters of a low-dimensional statistical body model (e.g. SMPL) from input
images, we train an ensemble of per-vertex neural fields network. The network
predicts, in a distributed manner, the vertex descent direction towards the
ground truth, based on neural features extracted at the current vertex
projection. At inference, we employ this network, dubbed LVD, within a
gradient-descent optimization pipeline until its convergence, which typically
occurs in a fraction of a second even when initializing all vertices into a
single point. An exhaustive evaluation demonstrates that our approach is able
to capture the underlying body of clothed people with very different body
shapes, achieving a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art. LVD
is also applicable to 3D model fitting of humans and hands, for which we show a
significant improvement to the SOTA with a much simpler and faster method.

stores the same quantum of data and each data bit stored has the same
replication factor across the nodes. Such systems are referred to as balanced
distributed databases. When existing nodes leave or new nodes are added to this
system, the balanced nature of the database is lost, either due to the
reduction in the replication factor, or the non-uniformity of the storage at
the nodes. This triggers a rebalancing algorithm, that exchanges data between
the nodes so that the balance of the database is reinstated. The goal is then
to design rebalancing schemes with minimal communication load. In a recent work
by Krishnan et al., coded transmissions were used to rebalance a carefully
designed distributed database from a node removal or addition. These coded
rebalancing schemes have optimal communication load, however, require the
file-size to be at least exponential in the system parameters. In this work, we
consider a cyclic balanced database (where data is cyclically placed in the
system nodes) and present coded rebalancing schemes for node removal and
addition in such a database. These databases (and the associated rebalancing
schemes) require the file-size to be only cubic in the number of nodes in the
system. We bound the advantage of our node removal rebalancing scheme over the
uncoded scheme, and show that our scheme has a smaller communication load. In
the node addition scenario, the rebalancing scheme presented is a simple
uncoded scheme, which we show has optimal load.

lifted version, quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), unify and improve
the presentation of most quantum algorithms. QSP/QSVT characterize the ability,
by alternating ans\""atze, to obliviously transform the singular values of
subsystems of unitary matrices by polynomial functions; these algorithms are
numerically stable and analytically well-understood. That said, QSP/QSVT
require consistent access to a single oracle, saying nothing about computing
joint properties of two or more oracles; these can be far cheaper to determine
given an ability to pit oracles against one another coherently.
  This work introduces a corresponding theory of QSP over multiple variables:
M-QSP. Surprisingly, despite the non-existence of the fundamental theorem of
algebra for multivariable polynomials, there exist necessary and sufficient
conditions under which a desired stable multivariable polynomial transformation
is possible. Moreover, the classical subroutines used by QSP protocols survive
in the multivariable setting for non-obvious reasons, and remain numerically
stable and efficient. Up to a well-defined conjecture, we give proof that the
family of achievable multivariable transforms is as loosely constrained as
could be expected. The unique ability of M-QSP to obliviously approximate joint
functions of multiple variables coherently leads to novel speedups
incommensurate with those of other quantum algorithms, and provides a bridge
from quantum algorithms to algebraic geometry.

elucidating the physics at the critical point of the Aubry-Andre (AA)
Hamiltonian, which exhibits a fractal spectrum with multifractal wave
functions, leading to an AA Anderson (AAA) impurity model with an
energy-dependent hybridization function defined through the multifractal local
density of states at the impurity site. We first study a class of Anderson
impurity models with uniform fractal hybridization functions that the NRG can
solve to arbitrarily low temperatures. Below a Kondo scale $T_K$, these models
approach a fractal strong-coupling fixed point where impurity thermodynamic
properties oscillate with $\log_b T$ about negative average values determined
by the fractal dimension of the spectrum. The fractal dimension also enters
into a power-law dependence of $T_K$ on the Kondo exchange coupling $J_K$. To
treat the AAA model, we combine the NRG with the kernel polynomial method (KPM)
to form an efficient approach that can treat hosts without translational
symmetry down to a temperature scale set by the KPM expansion order. The
aforementioned fractal strong-coupling fixed point is reached by the critical
AAA model in a simplified treatment that neglects the wave-function
contribution to the hybridization. The temperature-averaged properties are
those expected for the numerically determined fractal dimension of $0.5$. At
the AA critical point, impurity thermodynamic properties become negative and
oscillatory. Under sample-averaging, the mean and median Kondo temperatures
exhibit power-law dependences on $J_K$ with exponents characteristic of
different fractal dimensions. We attribute these signatures to the impurity
probing a distribution of fractal strong-coupling fixed points with decreasing
temperature.

unaligned image collections and their poses without any 3D supervision.
Generally, image collections on the internet contain several intra-category

different topologies, which makes the task of joint shape and correspondence
estimation much more challenging. Because of this, prior works either focus on
learning each 3D object shape individually without modeling cross-instance

categories with minimal intra-category topological variations. We overcome
these restrictions by learning a topologically-aware implicit deformation field
that maps a 3D point in the object space to a higher dimensional point in the
category-specific canonical space. At inference time, given a single image, we
reconstruct the underlying 3D shape by first implicitly deforming each 3D point
in the object space to the learned category-specific canonical space using the
topologically-aware deformation field and then reconstructing the 3D shape as a

the stellar and ionized gas motion from 10$\,$kpc down to 30$\,$pc around the

ionized gas shows tenuous spiral features in the center. We resolve a compact
star forming circumnuclear ellipse (CNE) that has a semi-minor axis of
306$\,$pc. Within this CNE, the gas is metal rich and its line ratios are
entirely consistent with excitation by star formation. With an integrated SFR
of $0.19 \pm 0.05 \,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ the CNE contributes 27% of
the galaxy-wide star formation. We conclude that Mrk 1044's nuclear activity
has not yet affected the circumnuclear star formation. Thus, Mrk 1044 is
consistent with the idea that NLS1s are young AGN. A simple mass budget
consideration suggests that the circumnuclear star formation and AGN phase are
connected and the patterns in the ionized gas velocity field are a signature of
the ongoing AGN feeding.

corrections to extremal charged black holes to increase their charge-to-mass
ratio. This allows decay via emission of a smaller extremal black hole. In this
paper, we investigate if similar constraints hold for extremal rotating black
holes. We do so by considering the leading higher derivative corrections to the
four-dimensional Kerr black hole and five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole.
We use a known mapping of these rotating solutions to a four-dimensional
non-rotating dyonic Kaluza-Klein black hole and impose the WGC on this charged
solution. Going back again to the rotating solutions, this fixes the sign of
the corrections to the rotating extremality bounds. The sign of the corrections
is non-universal, depending on the black hole under consideration. We argue
that this is not at odds with black hole decay, because of the presence of a
superradiant instability that persists in the extremal limit. When this
instability is present, the WGC is implied for the four-dimensional charged
black hole.

mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and direct plunges occurring around massive black
holes (MBHs) in galactic nuclei. We test our code by exploring a wide range of
the astrophysically relevant parameter space, including MBH masses, galaxy
central densities and inner density slopes. We find that mass segregation and,
more in general, the time dependency of the distribution function regulate the
event rate: TDEs always decline with time, whereas EMRIs and plunges reach a
maximum and undergo a subsequent nearly exponential decay. Once suitably
normalized, the rates associated to different choices of MBH mass and galaxy
density overlap nearly perfectly. Based on this, we provide a simple scaling
that allows to reproduce the time-dependent event rates for any MBH mass and
underlying galactic nucleus. Although our peak rates are in general agreement
with the literature relying on the steady-state (non-time dependent)
assumption, those can be sustained on a timescale that strongly depends on the
properties of the system. In particular this can be much shorter than a Gyr for
relatively light MBHs residing in dense systems. This warns against using
steady state models to compute global TDE, EMRI and plunge rates and calls for
a more sophisticated, time dependent treatment of the problem.

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm aims to prepare the ground

an advantage compared to classical trial states used, for instance, in quantum
Monte Carlo or tensor network calculations. While traditionally, the main focus
has been on developing better trial circuits, we show that the algorithm's
success crucially depends on other parameters such as the learning rate, the
number $N_s$ of measurements to estimate the gradient components, and the
Hamiltonian gap $\Delta$. We first observe the existence of a finite $N_s$
value below which the optimization is impossible, and the energy variance
resembles the behavior of the specific heat in second-order phase transitions.
Secondly, when $N_s$ is above such threshold level, and learning is possible,
we develop a phenomenological model that relates the fidelity of the state
preparation with the optimization hyperparameters as well as $\Delta$. More
specifically, we observe that the computational resources scale as
$1/\Delta^2$, and we propose a symmetry-enhanced simulation protocol that

robustly identifying and extracting substructures in deep imaging data of dwarf
ETGs in the Virgo galaxy cluster. Here we apply our method to a sample of 23
dwarf ETGs in the Fornax galaxy cluster, out of which 9 have disk-like and 14
have clump-like substructures. According to Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) data, our
sample constitutes $12\%$ of all dwarf ETGs in Fornax brighter than
$\text{M}_{r}=-13$ mag, and contains all cases that unequivocally exhibit
substructure features. We use $g$ and $r$-band FDS images to measure the
relative contribution of the substructures to the total galaxy light and to
estimate their $g-r$ colors. We find that substructures typically contribute
$8.7\%$ and $5.3\%$ of the total galaxy light in the $g$ and $r$ bands,
respectively, within two effective radii. Disk substructures are usually found
in dwarf ETGs with redder global colors, and they can be either as red as or
bluer than their galaxy's diffuse component. In contrast, clump substructures
are found in comparatively bluer dwarf ETGs, and they are always bluer than
their galaxy's diffuse component. These results provide further evidence that
dwarf ETGs can hide diverse complex substructures, with stellar populations
that can greatly differ from those of the dominant diffuse light in which they
are embedded.

is incomplete, motivating a new theoretical examination of the physical
processes responsible for nova mass ejection. In this paper, we perform
hydrodynamical simulations of classical nova outflows using the stellar
evolution code MESA. We find that, when the binary companion is neglected,
white dwarfs with masses >= 0.8 Msol successfully launch
radiation-pressure-driven optically thick winds that carry away most of the
envelope. However, for most of the mass loss phase, these winds are accelerated
at radii beyond the white dwarf's Roche radius assuming a typical cataclysmic
variable donor. This means that, before a standard optically thick wind can be
formed, mass loss will instead be initiated and shaped by the binary
interaction. An isotropic optically thick wind is only successfully launched
when the acceleration region recedes within the white dwarf's Roche radius,
which occurs after most of the envelope has already been ejected. The
interaction between these two modes of outflow -- a first phase of slow,
binary-driven, equatorially focused mass loss encompassing most of the mass
ejection and a second phase consisting of a fast, isotropic, optically thick
wind -- is consistent with observations of aspherical ejecta and signatures of
multiple outflow components. We also find that isolated lower-mass white dwarfs
<= 0.8 Msol do not develop unbound optically thick winds at any stage, making
it even more crucial to consider the effects of the binary companion on the
resulting outburst.

M dwarf host stars. We find $^{13}$CO$_{2}$ and $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ distinguishable
if the atmosphere is H$_{2}$-dominated with a few percentage points of CO$_{2}$

abundant isotopologues, $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ and $^{13}$CO$_{2}$. With a
Neptune-like metallicity of 100$\times$ solar and a C/O of 0.55, we are unable
to distinguish between $^{13}$CO$_{2}$ and $^{12}$CO$_{2}$ in the atmospheres
of temperate sub-Neptunes. If atmospheric composition largely follows
metallicity scaling, the concentration of CO$_{2}$ in a H$_{2}$-dominated
atmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO$_{2}$ isotopologues with JWST. In
contrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO$_{2}$, but the smaller
atmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible. Carbon dioxide
isotopologues are unlikely to be useful biosignature gases for the JWST era.
Instead, isotopologue measurements should be used to evaluate formation
mechanisms of planets and exoplanetary systems.

resonators is an established method of determining small losses in
superconducting devices. Traditionally, the resonator losses are only
attributed to two-level system (TLS) defects using a power dependent model for
the quality factor. However, excess non-equilibrium quasiparticles can also
limit the quality factor of the planar superconducting resonators used in
circuit quantum electrodynamics. At millikelvin temperatures, quasiparticles
can be generated by breaking Cooper pairs via a single high-energy or multiple
sub-gap photons. Here a two-temperature, power and temperature dependent model
is proposed to evaluate resonator losses for isolating TLS and quasiparticle
loss simultaneously. The model combines the conventional TLS power and
temperature dependence with an effective temperature non-equilibrium
quasiparticle description of the superconducting loss. The quasiparticle
description is based on the quasiparticle number density calculated using rate
equations for an external quasiparticle generation source, recombination, and
trapping. The number density is translated to an effective temperature using a
thermal distribution that may be different from the bath. Experimental
measurements of high-quality factor resonators fabricated from single crystal
aluminum and titanium nitride thin films on silicon are interpreted with the
presented model. This approach enables identification of quasiparticle and TLS
loss, resulting in the determination that the TiN resonator has comparable TLS
and quasiparticle loss at low power and low-temperature, while the
low-temperature Al resonator behavior is dominated by non-equilibrium
quasiparticle loss.

Teleportation channels are created by distributing an entangled state between

This causes critical delays that can cause information loss as quantum data
suffers from decoherence when stored in memory. In this work, we quantify the
effect of decoherence on fidelity at a node in a quantum network due to the
storage of qubits in noisy memory platforms. We model the memory platform as a
buffer that stores incoming qubits waiting for the creation of a teleportation
channel. Memory platforms are parameterized with decoherence rate and buffer
size, in addition to the order in which the incoming qubits are served. We show
that fidelity at a node is a linear sum of terms, exponentially decaying with
time, where the decay rate depends on the decoherence rate of the memory
platform. This allows us to utilize Laplace Transforms to derive efficiently
computable functions of average fidelity with respect to the load, buffer size,
and decoherence rate of the memory platform. We prove that serving qubits in a

editing: modifying images by their content, rather than their pixel values.
Unfortunately, working with arbitrary images requires inverting the StyleGAN
generator, which has remained challenging so far. Existing inversion approaches
obtain promising yet imperfect results, having to trade-off between
reconstruction quality and downstream editability. To improve quality, these
approaches must resort to various techniques that extend the model latent space
after training. Taking a step back, we observe that these methods essentially
all propose, in one way or another, to increase the number of free parameters.
This suggests that inversion might be difficult because it is underconstrained.
In this work, we address this directly and dramatically overparameterize the
latent space, before training, with simple changes to the original StyleGAN
architecture. Our overparameterization increases the available degrees of
freedom, which in turn facilitates inversion. We show that this allows us to
obtain near-perfect image reconstruction without the need for encoders nor for
altering the latent space after training. Our approach also retains
editability, which we demonstrate by realistically interpolating between

does not require labeled training data which makes it extendable to many

cosmological distances. It is followed by, and sometimes partially overlaps
with, a similarly energetic but very broadband and longer-lasting afterglow
emission. While most GRBs are detected below a few MeV, over a hundred were
detected at high ($\gtrsim0.1\;$GeV) energies and several have now been
observed up to tens of GeV with the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT).
A new electromagnetic window in the very high energy (VHE) domain
($\gtrsim0.1\;$TeV) was recently opened with the detection of afterglow
emission in the $(0.1$\textendash$1)\,$TeV energy band by ground-based imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The emission mechanism for the VHE spectral
component is not fully understood, and its detection offers important
constraints for GRB physics. This review provides a brief overview of the
different leptonic and hadronic mechanisms capable of producing VHE emission in
GRBs. The same mechanisms possibly give rise to the high-energy spectral
component seen during the prompt emission of many \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRBs.
Possible origins of its delayed onset and long duration, well into the
afterglow phase, with implications for the emission region and relativistic
collisionless shock physics are discussed. Key results for using GRBs as ideal
probes for constraining models of extra-galactic background light and
intergalactic magnetic fields, as well as for testing Lorentz invariance
violation, are presented.

density from repeated individual spatial encounters. SCR accounts for the
inherent spatial autocorrelation in individual detections by modelling
detection probabilities as a function of distance between the detectors and
individual activity centres. However, additional spatial heterogeneity in
detection probability may still creep in due to environmental or sampling
characteristics. if unaccounted for, such variation can lead to pronounced bias
in population size estimates. Using simulations, we describe and test three
Bayesian SCR models that use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to account
for latent heterogeneity in baseline detection probability across detectors
using: independent random effects (RE), spatially autocorrelated random effects
(SARE), and a two-group finite mixture model (FM). Overall, SARE provided the
least biased population size estimates (median RB: -9 -- 6%). When spatial
autocorrelation was high, SARE also performed best at predicting the spatial
pattern of heterogeneity in detection probability. At intermediate levels of
autocorrelation, spatially-explicit estimates of detection probability obtained
with FM where more accurate than those generated by SARE and RE. In cases where
the number of detections per detector is realistically low (at most 1), all
GLMMs considered here may require dimension reduction of the random effects by
pooling baseline detection probability parameters across neighboring detectors
(""aggregation"") to avoid over-parameterization. The added complexity and
computational overhead associated with SCR-GLMMs may only be justified in
extreme cases of spatial heterogeneity. However, even in less extreme cases,
detecting and estimating spatially heterogeneous detection probability may
assist in planning or adjusting monitoring schemes.

employed for fundamental research and application purposes, the modifications
of the microgel internal structure occurring at the VPT are not yet completely
understood, especially concerning the role of electrostatics. Here we study in
detail, both experimentally and numerically, the effect of the addition of
acrylic acid (AAc) co-monomer on the microgel deswelling process. By combining
viscosimetry, light scattering and electrophoresis, we show that the
progressive addition of AAc increases the microgel mass and suppresses the
occurrence of the VPT, progressively shifting the microgel collapse to higher
temperatures. Most importantly, it also highly enhances the two-step deswelling
of these submicron-sized networks, so that the inner core collapses at
temperatures always lower than those marking the transition of the outer
corona. These results indicate that a net increase of the charge density
mismatch between the bulk and the surface of the microgels takes place.
Numerical simulations fully confirm this scenario and clarify the impact of the
charge distribution on the two-step deswelling, with mobile counterions
efficiently screening the charges within the inner core, while leaving more
monomers ionized on the surface. Our work unambiguously shows how electrostatic
interactions influence the behavior of thermosensitive microgels in aqueous

analysis is based on the contributions arising from the sector in question to
the anomalous dipole moment for leptons calculated at the one loop level, for
which an analytical expression is obtained. The largest contribution of this
Lorentz violating coefficient is on the lightest lepton, which results as a
consequence of a strong non-decoupling effect. By using the experimental
uncertainty of the electron anomalous dipole moment we predict that $|k^2_{

  Representations",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Perceptual understanding of the scene and the relationship between its
different components is important for successful completion of robotic tasks.
Representation learning has been shown to be a powerful technique for this, but
most of the current methodologies learn task specific representations that do
not necessarily transfer well to other tasks. Furthermore, representations
learned by supervised methods require large labeled datasets for each task that
are expensive to collect in the real world. Using self-supervised learning to
obtain representations from unlabeled data can mitigate this problem. However,
current self-supervised representation learning methods are mostly object
agnostic, and we demonstrate that the resulting representations are
insufficient for general purpose robotics tasks as they fail to capture the
complexity of scenes with many components. In this paper, we explore the
effectiveness of using object-aware representation learning techniques for
robotic tasks. Our self-supervised representations are learned by observing the
agent freely interacting with different parts of the environment and is queried
in two different settings: (i) policy learning and (ii) object location
prediction. We show that our model learns control policies in a
sample-efficient manner and outperforms state-of-the-art object agnostic
techniques as well as methods trained on raw RGB images. Our results show a 20
percent increase in performance in low data regimes (1000 trajectories) in
policy training using implicit behavioral cloning (IBC). Furthermore, our
method outperforms the baselines for the task of object localization in
multi-object scenes.

is achieved by the 1D red-detuned optical lattice, which is generated by
interference of a focus-tunable laser beam and a focus-fixed laser beam.

to study the diffuse UV, optical, and near-IR backgrounds and foregrounds in
detail. Here we utilize SKYSURF's first sky-surface brightness measurements to
constrain the level of near-IR diffuse Extragalactic Background Light (EBL).
Our sky-surface brightness measurements have been verified to an accuracy of
better than 1%, which when combined with systematic errors associated with HST,
results in sky brightness uncertainties of $\sim$2-4% $\simeq$ 0.005 MJy/sr in
each image. We put limits on the amount of diffuse EBL in three near-IR filters
(F125W, F140W, and F160W) by comparing our preliminary sky measurements of $>
30,000$ images to Zodiacal light models, carefully selecting the darkest images
to avoid contamination from stray light. In addition, we investigate the impact
that instrumental thermal emission has on our measurements, finding that it has
a limited impact on F125W and F140W measurements, whereas uncertainties in the
exact thermal state of HST results in significant uncertainties in the level of
astrophysical diffuse light in F160W images. When compared to the Kelsall et
al. (1998) Zodiacal model, an isotropic diffuse background of $30$ nW m$^{-2}$
sr$^{-1}$ remains, whereas using the Wright (1998) Zodiacal model results in no
discernible diffuse background. Based primarily on uncertainties in the
foreground model subtraction, we present limits on the amount of diffuse EBL of
29 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, 40 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, and 29 nW m$^{-2}$
sr$^{-1}$ for F125W, F140W, and F160W respectively. While this light is
generally isotropic, our modeling at this point does not distinguish between a
cosmological origin or a Solar System origin (such as a dim, diffuse, spherical

exposed to the pyroelectric field of a lithium niobate ferroelectric crystal
substrate. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal in which almost
complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal
macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis.
Upon entering the ferroelectric phase by reducing the temperature from the
nematic phase, the liquid crystal droplets become electromechanically unstable
and disintegrate by the explosive emission of fluid jets. These jets are mostly
interfacial, spreading out on the substrate surface, and exhibit fractal
branching out into smaller streams to eventually disrupt, forming secondary
droplets. We understand this behavior as a manifestation of the Rayleigh
instability of electrically charged fluid droplets, expected when the
electrostatic repulsion exceeds the surface tension of the fluid. In this case
the charges are due to the bulk polarization of the ferroelectric fluid which
couples to the pyroelectric polarization of the underlying lithium niobate
substrate through its fringing field and solid-fluid interface coupling. Since

astrophysical phenomena. However, many techniques to estimate stellar ages are
highly model-dependent. The lithium depletion boundary (LDB), based on the
presence or absence of lithium in low-mass stars, can be used to derive ages in
stellar associations of between 20 and 500~Ma. The purpose of this work is to
revise former LDB ages in stellar associations in a consistent way, taking
advantage of the homogeneous \textit{Gaia} parallaxes as well as bolometric
luminosity estimations that do not rely on monochromatic bolometric
corrections. We studied nine open clusters and three moving groups
characterised by a previous determination of the LDB age. We gathered all the
available information from our data and the literature: membership, distances,
photometric data, reddening, metallicity, and surface gravity. We re-assigned
membership and calculated bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures
using distances derived from Gaia DR2 and multi-wavelength photometry for
individual objects around the former LDB. We located the LDB using a
homogeneous method for all the stellar associations. Finally, we estimated the
age by comparing it with different evolutionary models. We located the LDB for
the twelve stellar associations and derived their ages using several
theoretical evolutionary models. We compared the LDB ages among them, along
with data obtained with other techniques, such as isochrone fitting, ultimately
finding some discrepancies among the various approaches. Finally, we remark
that the 32 Ori MG is likely to be composed of at least two populations of
different ages.

automated machine learning (AutoML). NAS has outperformed hand-designed
networks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the
design of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human
expertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task,
leaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked.
Generally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel
task. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or
transferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no
performance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a
meta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search
(DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred
architecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity
measure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as
transfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better.
Additionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned
over multiple tasks. Experiments show that warm-started DARTS is able to find
competitive performing architectures while reducing searching costs on average
by 60%.

to offload programs from the host to the SSD. It has been proven to be an
effective approach to alleviating the I/O bottleneck. To facilitate in-storage
computing, many frameworks have been proposed. However, few of them consider
security as the priority for in-storage computing. Specifically, since modern
SSD controllers do not have a trusted execution environment, an offloaded
(malicious) program could steal, modify, and even destroy the data stored in
the SSD. In this paper, we first investigate the attacks that could be
conducted by offloaded in-storage programs. To defend against these attacks, we
build IceClave, a lightweight trusted execution environment for in-storage
computing. IceClave enables security isolation between in-storage programs and
flash management functions. IceClave also achieves security isolation between
in-storage programs and enforces memory encryption and integrity verification
of in-storage DRAM with low overhead. To protect data loaded from flash chips,
IceClave develops a lightweight data encryption/decryption mechanism in flash
controllers. We develop IceClave with a full system simulator and evaluate
IceClave with a variety of data-intensive applications. Compared to
state-of-the-art in-storage computing approaches, IceClave introduces only 7.6%
performance overhead, while enforcing security isolation in the SSD controller
with minimal hardware cost. IceClave still keeps the performance benefit of
in-storage computing by delivering up to 2.31$\times$ better performance than
the conventional host-based trusted computing approach.

search engines, are ubiquitous in today's digital society. They facilitate
information discovery by ranking retrieved items on predicted relevance, i.e.
likelihood of interaction (click, share) between users and items. Typically
modeled using past interactions, such rankings have a major drawback:
interaction depends on the attention items receive. A highly-relevant item
placed outside a user's attention could receive little interaction. This
discrepancy between observed interaction and true relevance is termed the
position bias. Position bias degrades relevance estimation and when it
compounds over time, it can silo users into false relevant items, causing
marketplace inefficiencies. Position bias may be identified with randomized
experiments, but such an approach can be prohibitive in cost and feasibility.
Past research has also suggested propensity score methods, which do not
adequately address unobserved confounding; and regression discontinuity
designs, which have poor external validity. In this work, we address these
concerns by leveraging the abundance of A/B tests in ranking evaluations as
instrumental variables. Historical A/B tests allow us to access exogenous
variation in rankings without manually introducing them, harming user
experience and platform revenue. We demonstrate our methodology in two distinct
applications at LinkedIn - feed ads and the People-You-May-Know (PYMK)
recommender. The marketplaces comprise users and campaigns on the ads side, and
invite senders and recipients on PYMK. By leveraging prior experimentation, we
obtain quasi-experimental variation in item rankings that is orthogonal to user
relevance. Our method provides robust position effect estimates that handle
unobserved confounding well, greater generalizability, and easily extends to
other information retrieval systems.

However, the WF law is for the linear response, and whether or not the
universal law is valid even in the nonlinear regime of Bose systems remains an
open issue. Here we provide a solution to this fundamental challenge. We show
that the ratio of the thermal to spin transport coefficient of magnons in

update models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the
attacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage
of one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to
leverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against
the original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific
ways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions

justification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show
that our attacks are effective at using update information to give the
adversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also
compared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a

stabilized finite element for a linearized problem in incompressible fluid
mechanics, namely, the steady Oseen equation with low viscosity. Stabilization
terms are defined by jumps of different combinations of derivatives for the
convective term over the element faces of the triangulation of the domain. With
the help of these stabilizing terms, and the fact the finite element space is
assumed to provide a point-wise divergence-free velocity, an $\mathcal
O\big(h^{k+\frac12}\big)$ error estimate in the $L^2$-norm is proved for the
method (in the convection-dominated regime), and optimal order estimates in the
remaining norms of the error. Numerical results supporting the theoretical

amongst these difficulties is that such systems are often ill-conditioned, i.e.
small changes in the system can produce large changes in the solution, which
can slow down the performance of linear solving algorithms. We test several

insufficient. We then introduce the inverse Laplacian preconditioner, which
improves the scaling of the condition number of the system from $O(N)$ to
$O(\sqrt{N})$ and admits a quantum implementation. These results are a critical
first step in developing a quantum solver for fracture systems, both advancing
the state of hydrological modeling and providing a novel real-world application

PPISN models are explored, each with two different choices of carbon abundance
following helium burning. Carbon is an important parameter because shell carbon
burning can weaken the explosion. The three subclasses correspond to situations
where SN~1961V and its immediate afterglow were: a) a single event; b) the
first of two or more pulsational events separated by decades or centuries; or
c) the latter stages of a complex explosion that had already been going on for

to realistically evaluate the feasibility of the bang-bang control, which is
then implemented on the robot in experiments to demonstrate first-time

manipulating the phases of the incident electromagnetic wave to improve the
wireless propagation environment between the base-station (BS) and the users.
This paper addresses the joint user scheduling, RIS configuration, and BS
beamforming problem in an RIS-assisted downlink network with limited pilot
overhead. We show that graph neural networks (GNN) with permutation invariant
and equivariant properties can be used to appropriately schedule users and to
design RIS configurations to achieve high overall throughput while accounting
for fairness among the users. As compared to the conventional methodology of
first estimating the channels then optimizing the user schedule, RIS
configuration and the beamformers, this paper shows that an optimized user
schedule can be obtained directly from a very short set of pilots using a GNN,
then the RIS configuration can be optimized using a second GNN, and finally the
BS beamformers can be designed based on the overall effective channel.
Numerical results show that the proposed approach can utilize the received
pilots more efficiently than the conventional channel estimation based
approach, and can generalize to systems with an arbitrary number of users.

feature extractor for various downstream tasks. In this work, we propose
PoisonedEncoder, a data poisoning attack to contrastive learning. In
particular, an attacker injects carefully crafted poisoning inputs into the
unlabeled pre-training data, such that the downstream classifiers built based
on the poisoned encoder for multiple target downstream tasks simultaneously
classify attacker-chosen, arbitrary clean inputs as attacker-chosen, arbitrary
classes. We formulate our data poisoning attack as a bilevel optimization
problem, whose solution is the set of poisoning inputs; and we propose a
contrastive-learning-tailored method to approximately solve it. Our evaluation
on multiple datasets shows that PoisonedEncoder achieves high attack success
rates while maintaining the testing accuracy of the downstream classifiers
built upon the poisoned encoder for non-attacker-chosen inputs. We also
evaluate five defenses against PoisonedEncoder, including one pre-processing,
three in-processing, and one post-processing defenses. Our results show that
these defenses can decrease the attack success rate of PoisonedEncoder, but
they also sacrifice the utility of the encoder or require a large clean

complex mixture of DNA molecules is experimentally challenging due to
sequencing errors. Barcoding of target DNA molecules in library construction
for next-generation sequencing provides a way to identify and bioinformatically
remove polymerase induced errors. During the barcoding procedure involving $t$
consecutive PCR cycles, the DNA molecules become barcoded by unique molecular
identifiers (UMI). Different library construction protocols utilise different
values of $t$. The effect of a larger $t$ and imperfect PCR amplifications is
poorly described.
  This paper proposes a branching process with growing immigration as a model
describing the random outcome of $t$ cycles of PCR barcoding. Our model
discriminates between five different amplification rates $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$,
$r_4$, $r$ for different types of molecules associated with the PCR barcoding
procedure. We study this model by focussing on $C_t$, the number of clusters of
molecules sharing the same UMI, as well as $C_t(m)$, the number of UMI clusters
of size $m$. Our main finding is a remarkable asymptotic pattern valid for
moderately large $t$. It turns out that $E(C_t(m))/E(C_t)\approx 2^{-m}$ for
$m=1,2,\ldots$, regardless of the underlying parameters $(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r)$.
The knowledge of the quantities $C_t$ and $C_t(m)$ as functions of the
experimental parameters $t$ and $(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r)$ will help the users to
draw more adequate conclusions from the outcomes of different sequencing

defines how to express both the meaning of individual words as well as their

used quantum machine learning techniques to map from text to class label using

model to design a quantum-based kernel function that can be used by a support
vector machine (SVM) for NLP tasks. Two similarity measures were studied: (i)
the transition amplitude approach and (ii) the SWAP test. A simple NLP meaning
classification task from previous work was used to train the word embeddings
and evaluate the performance of both models. The Python module lambeq and its
related software stack was used for implementation. The explicit model from
previous work was used to train word embeddings and achieved a testing accuracy
of $93.09 \pm 0.01$%. It was shown that both the SVM variants achieved a higher
testing accuracy of $95.72 \pm 0.01$% for approach (i) and $97.14 \pm 0.01$%
for (ii). The SWAP test was then simulated under a noise model defined by the
real quantum device, ibmq_guadalupe. The explicit model achieved an accuracy of
$91.94 \pm 0.01$% while the SWAP test SVM achieved 96.7% on the testing

analysis of state-of-the-art methods for video-based assessment of surgical
skill in the operating room. Methods: Using a data set of 99 videos of
capsulorhexis, a critical step in cataract surgery, we evaluate feature based
methods previously developed for surgical skill assessment mostly under
benchtop settings. In addition, we present and validate two deep learning
methods that directly assess skill using RGB videos. In the first method, we
predict instrument tips as keypoints, and learn surgical skill using temporal
convolutional neural networks. In the second method, we propose a novel
architecture for surgical skill assessment that includes a frame-wise encoder
(2D convolutional neural network) followed by a temporal model (recurrent
neural network), both of which are augmented by visual attention mechanisms. We
report the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity,
specificity, and predictive values with each method through 5-fold
cross-validation. Results: For the task of binary skill classification (expert
vs. novice), deep neural network based methods exhibit higher AUC than the
classical spatiotemporal interest point based methods. The neural network
approach using attention mechanisms also showed high sensitivity and
specificity. Conclusion: Deep learning methods are necessary for video-based
assessment of surgical skill in the operating room. Our findings of internal

a textbook data set on wages, extracted from the National Longitudinal Survey

and exploratory analysis of longitudinal data. Subsets of NLSY79, including the
wages data, can be found in supplementary files from numerous textbooks and
research articles. The NLSY79 database has been continuously updated through to
2018, so new records are available. Here we describe our journey to refresh the

spectra $\mathrm{prim}\,\mathbb{C}_q[G]_{w_1,w_2}$ in a new fashion, and
construct a bundle of $(w_1,w_2)$ type simple modules onto
$\mathrm{prim}\,\mathbb{C}_q[G]_{w_1,w_2}$, provided
$\mathrm{Supp}(w_1)\cap\mathrm{Supp}(w_2)=\varnothing$ or enough pivot

simple modules of 2-dimensional quantum torus $L_q(2)$. As an application of
our theory, we deduce an equivalent condition for the tensor module to be
simple, and construct some simple modules for each primitive ideal when
$G=SL_3(\mathbb{C})$. This completes the Dixmier's program for
$\mathbb{C}_q[SL_3]$. The wiring diagrams, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky

used to accelerate Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. However, we demonstrate in this
paper that for hyperbolic systems, whether MLMC can achieve a real boost turns
out to be delicate. The computational costs of MLMC and MC depend on the
interplay among the accuracy (bias) and the computational cost of the numerical
method for a single sample, as well as the variances of the sampled MLMC
corrections or MC solutions. We characterize three regimes for the MLMC and MC
performances using those parameters, and show that MLMC may not accelerate MC
and can even have a higher cost when the variances of MC solutions and MLMC
corrections are of the same order. Our studies are carried out by a few
prototype hyperbolic systems: a linear scalar equation, the Euler and shallow
water equations, and a linear relaxation model, the above statements are proved
analytically in some cases, and demonstrated numerically for the cases of the

  https://weizhe-chen.github.io/attentive_kernels/",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robotic Information Gathering (RIG) relies on the uncertainty of a
probabilistic model to identify critical areas for efficient data collection.
Gaussian processes (GPs) with stationary kernels have been widely adopted for
spatial modeling. However, real-world spatial data typically does not satisfy
the assumption of stationarity, where different locations are assumed to have
the same degree of variability. As a result, the prediction uncertainty does
not accurately capture prediction error, limiting the success of RIG
algorithms. We propose a novel family of nonstationary kernels, named the
Attentive Kernel (AK), which is simple, robust, and can extend any existing
kernel to a nonstationary one. We evaluate the new kernel in elevation mapping
tasks, where AK provides better accuracy and uncertainty quantification over
the commonly used RBF kernel and other popular nonstationary kernels. The
improved uncertainty quantification guides the downstream RIG planner to
collect more valuable data around the high-error area, further increasing
prediction accuracy. A field experiment demonstrates that the proposed method
can guide an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) to prioritize data collection in
locations with high spatial variations, enabling the model to characterize the
salient environmental features.

solve the dilemma of having no access to the target domain during training, we
introduce Test-time Fourier Style Calibration (TF-Cal) for calibrating the

Fourier transformation to decompose features into amplitude (style) features

an existing test case (e.g., a sentence with its label) and assume the
generated one preserves an equivalent or similar semantic meaning and thus, the
same label. However, in practice, many of the generated test cases fail to
preserve similar semantic meaning and are unnatural (e.g., grammar errors),
which leads to a high false alarm rate and unnatural test cases. Our evaluation
study finds that 44% of the test cases generated by the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches are false alarms. These test cases require extensive manual checking
effort, and instead of improving NLP software, they can even degrade NLP
software when utilized in model training. To address this problem, we propose
AEON for Automatic Evaluation Of NLP test cases. For each generated test case,
it outputs scores based on semantic similarity and language naturalness. We
employ AEON to evaluate test cases generated by four popular testing techniques

the best baseline metric by 10%. In addition, AEON also has the highest average
precision of finding unnatural test cases, surpassing the baselines by more

such an approach is runtime specific, which lacks a generic abstraction across

managed NVM deserves the same system-wide property for persistent objects

various managed languages, and manages NVM within a shared heap that enables
cross-language persistent object sharing. UniHeap reduces the object
persistence overhead by managing the shared heap in a log-structured manner and
coalescing object updates during the garbage collection. We implement UniHeap

vital role. In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only modifying
the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained
spectro-temporal differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech are
modelled using a novel set of speaker dependent (SD) generative adversarial
networks (GAN) based data augmentation approaches in this paper. These flexibly
allow both: a) temporal or speed perturbed normal speech spectra to be modified
and closer to those of an impaired speaker when parallel speech data is
available; and b) for non-parallel data, the SVD decomposed normal speech
spectral basis features to be transformed into those of a target elderly
speaker before being re-composed with the temporal bases to produce the

sensor can be stimulated as the result of internally driven activity, or by

processed differently - have you ever tried tickling yourself? The canonical
explanation of this difference is that when the brain sends a signal that would
result in motor activity, it uses a copy of that signal to predict the sensory
consequences of the resulting motor activity. The predicted sensory input is
then subtracted from the actual sensory input, resulting in attenuation of the
stimuli. To critically evaluate this idea, and investigate when non-predictive
solutions may be viable, we implement a computational model of a simple
embodied system with self-caused sensorimotor dynamics, and analyse how
controllers successfully accomplish tasks in this model. We find that in these
simple systems, solutions that regulate behaviour to control self-caused

characterizing tissue microstructure based on biophysical models, which are
complex and highly non-linear. Resolving microstructures with optimization
techniques is prone to estimation errors and requires dense sampling in the
q-space. Deep learning based approaches have been proposed to overcome these
limitations. Motivated by the superior performance of the Transformer, in this
work, we present a learning-based framework based on Transformer, namely, a
Microstructure Estimation Transformer with Sparse Coding (METSC) for dMRI-based
microstructure estimation with downsampled q-space data. To take advantage of
the Transformer while addressing its limitation in large training data
requirements, we explicitly introduce an inductive bias - model bias into the
Transformer using a sparse coding technique to facilitate the training process.
Thus, the METSC is composed with three stages, an embedding stage, a sparse
representation stage, and a mapping stage. The embedding stage is a
Transformer-based structure that encodes the signal to ensure the voxel is
represented effectively. In the sparse representation stage, a dictionary is
constructed by solving a sparse reconstruction problem that unfolds the
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) process. The mapping stage is essentially a
decoder that computes the microstructural parameters from the output of the
second stage, based on the weighted sum of normalized dictionary coefficients
where the weights are also learned. We tested our framework on two dMRI models
with downsampled q-space data, including the intravoxel incoherent motion
(IVIM) model and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)
model. The proposed method achieved up to 11.25 folds of acceleration in scan

that NEAT networks seem to rapidly increase in modularity over time with the
rate and convergence dependent on the problem. Interestingly, NEAT tends
towards increasingly modular networks even when network fitness converges. It
was shown that the ideal level of network modularity in the explored parameter

$k$-set agreement task by devising a suitable formula of epistemic logic. The
unsolvability of $k$-set agreement task is a well-known fact, which is a direct
consequence of Sperner's lemma, a classic result from combinatorial topology.
However, Sperner's lemma does not provide a good intuition for the
unsolvability,hiding it behind the elegance of its combinatorial statement. The
logical method has a merit that it can account for the reason of unsolvability
by a concrete formula, but no epistemic formula for the general unsolvability
result for $k$-set agreement task has been presented so far.
  We employ a variant of epistemic $\mu$-calculus, which extends the standard
epistemic logic with distributed knowledge operators and propositional
fixpoints, as the formal language of logic. With these extensions, we can
provide an epistemic $\mu$-calculus formula that mentions higher-dimensional
connectivity, which is essential in the original proof of Sperner's lemma, and

dependence of magnetic activity on rotation for stars with masses lower than

activity relation in the two clusters. We updated membership catalogs that
combine pre-Gaia catalogs with new catalogs based on Gaia Data Release 2. The
resulting catalogs are the most inclusive ones for both clusters: 1739 Praesepe
and 1315 Hyades stars. We collected X-ray detections for cluster members, for
which we analyzed, re-analyzed, or collated data from ROSAT, the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and XMM-Newton. We have
detections for 326 Praesepe and 462 Hyades members, of which 273 and 164,
respectively, have rotation periods, an increase of 6$\times$ relative to what
was previously available. We find that at $\approx$700 Myr, only M dwarfs
remain saturated in X-rays, with only tentative evidence for supersaturation.
We also find a tight relation between the Rossby number and fractional X-ray
luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ in unsaturated single members,
suggesting a power-law index between $-3.2$ and $-3.9$. Lastly, we find no
difference in the coronal parameters between binary and single members. These

heating of the stars' atmospheres, thereby informing the development of robust
age-rotation-activity relations.

of the properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as determined from
white-light observations performed by the SOHO/LASCO-C2 coronagraph. These
evolutions are further compared with those determined during the past two SC.
The integrated radiance of the K-corona and the occurrence rate of CMEs closely
track the indices/proxies of solar activity, prominently the total magnetic
field for the radiance and the radio flux for the CMEs, all undergoing a steep
increase during the ascending phase of SC 25. This increase is much steeper
than anticipated on the basis of the predicted quasi similarity between SC 25
and 24, and is confirmed by the recent evolution of the sunspot number. The
radiance reached the same base level during the minima of SC 24 and 25, but the
latitudinal extent of the streamer belt differed, being flatter during the
latter minimum and in fact more similar to that of the minimum of SC 23.
Phasing the descending branches of SC 23 and 24 led to a duration of SC 24 of
11.0 years, similar to that given by the sunspot number. In contrast, the base
level of the occurrence rate of CMEs during the minimum of SC 25 was
significantly larger than during the two previous minima. The southern
hemisphere is conspicuously more active than the northern one in agreement with
several predictions and the current evolution of the hemispheric sunspot
numbers. The mean apparent width of CMEs and the number of halo CMEs remains at
relatively large, constant levels throughout the early phase of SC 25 implying
the persistence of weak total pressure in the heliosphere. These results and
the perspective of a corona more active than anticipated are extremely
promising for the forthcoming observations by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar
Probe.

in recent years. Accordingly, it is both the price and the delivery time that
matter most to the ultimate customers of commercial enterprises. Consequently,
the importance of having an optimal delivery time is becoming increasingly
evident these days. Scheduling can be used to optimize supply chains and
production systems in this manner, which is one practical method for lowering
costs and boosting productivity. This paper suggests a multi-objective
scheduling model for hierarchical hub structures (HHS) with three levels of
service. The factory and customers hub (second level) and central are on the
first level in which the factory has a Flexible Flow Shop (FFS) environment.
The noncentral hub (third level) is responsible for the delivery of products
made in the factory to customers. Customer nodes and factories are connected
separately to the second level, and the non-central hubs are connected to the
third level. The model's objective is to minimize transportation and production
costs and product arrival times. To validate and evaluate the model, small
instances have been solved and analyzed in detail with the weighted sum and
e-constraint methods. Consequently, based on the ideal mean distance (MID)
metric, the two methods were compared for the designed instances. As
NP-hardness causes the previously proposed methods to solve large-scale
problems to be time-consuming, a meta-heuristic method was developed to solve

  In this paper, We present attacks based on black-box access to the target

that if an established shadow model is similar enough to the target model, then
the adversary can leverage the shadow model's information to predict a target
sample's membership.The logits of the trained target model contain valuable
sample knowledge. We build the shadow model by learning the logits of the
target model and making the shadow model more similar to the target model. Then
shadow model will have sufficient confidence in the member samples of the

scenarios in the ""small cloud regime"", and a scenario without shocks. On
aggregate, the supernova disruption is significantly weaker than that from an
idealised shock due to the supernova impact being instantaneous, and not
continuous. In both supernova-cloud interactions, we observe two shocks impact
the cloud, followed by the development of a weak 10 km s$^{-1}$ upstream flow
on the cloud interface, and a global ambient pressure drop. When the cloud is
still atomic, it expands due to this drop. Additionally, the TI is triggered at
the front of the cloud, causing the formation of a cap-like structure with
clumps embedded inside. The upstream flow converges in this region, resulting
in a lobe-like cloud morphology. When the cloud is molecular, the transmitted
shock disrupts the inter-clump material and causes the clumps' outer envelopes
to expand slightly and form tail-like morphologies. These effects are less
pronounced than those in our shock-cloud scenarios, and more pronounced that
those in our un-shocked scenario. After 3.5 Myrs, the effects from the
supernova decay and the cloud returns to an almost indistinguishable state from
an un-shocked cloud, in spite of the global ambient pressure drop. In neither
supernova-cloud scenario do we see any local gravitational collapse.

local subsystems under a suitable measurement. These correlations are beyond
the framework of classical statistics and the associated classical probability
distribution. Quantum entanglement is the most well known of such correlations
and plays an important role in quantum information theory. However, there exist
non-entangled states that still possess quantum correlations which cannot be
described by classical statistics. One such measure that captures these
nonclassical correlations is discord. Here we introduce a new measure of
quantum correlations which we call entropic accord that fits between
entanglement and discord. It is defined as the optimised minimax mutual
information of the outcome of the projective measurements between two parties.
We show a strict hierarchy exists between entanglement, entropic accord and
discord for two-qubit states. We study two-qubit states which shows the
relationship between the three entropic quantities. In addition to revealing a
class of correlations that are distinct from discord and entanglement, the
entropic accord measure can be inherently more intuitive in certain contexts.

wind instruments carries a lower risk of airborne disease transmission than
speaking or singing. We attribute this to the fact that the resonators of wind
instruments act as filters for particles >10 $\mu$m in diameter. We have also
measured the size-dependent filtering properties of different types of filters

calculated the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different near-

that in all cases where there is a possibility that the musician is infectious,
the only safe measure to prevent airborne transmission of the disease is the
use of well-fitting and well-filtering masks for the instrument and the

However, such extra information inevitably causes the cloud models to be more

vast number of queries are inevitably required by existing attack strategies

observation that current querying strategies suffer from decision boundary

semantic alignment between textual concepts and corresponding visual objects.
Existing methods mostly seek to align the word representations with the video
regions. However, word representations are often not able to convey a complete
description of textual concepts, which are in general described by the
compositions of certain words. To address this issue, we propose to first build
a syntactic dependency tree for each question with an off-the-shelf tool and
use it to guide the extraction of meaningful word compositions. Based on the
extracted compositions, a hypergraph is further built by viewing the words as
nodes and the compositions as hyperedges. Hypergraph convolutional networks
(HCN) are then employed to learn the initial representations of word
compositions. Afterwards, an optimal transport based method is proposed to
perform cross-modal semantic alignment for the textual and visual semantic
space. To reflect the cross-modal influences, the cross-modal information is
incorporated into the initial representations, leading to a model named
cross-modality-aware syntactic HCN. Experimental results on three benchmarks
show that our method outperforms all strong baselines. Further analyses
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, and show that our model is
good at modeling different levels of semantic compositions and filtering out
irrelevant information.

confounding feature, and video length is a confounding feature in video
recommendation. If we fit a model on such interaction data, just as done by
most data-driven recommender systems, the model will be biased to recommend
short videos more, and deviate from user actual requirement.
  This work formulates and addresses the problem from the causal perspective.
Assuming there are some factors affecting both the confounding feature and
other item features, e.g., the video creator, we find the confounding feature
opens a backdoor path behind user item matching and introduces spurious
correlation. To remove the effect of backdoor path, we propose a framework
named Deconfounding Causal Recommendation (DCR), which performs intervened
inference with do-calculus. Nevertheless, evaluating do calculus requires to
sum over the prediction on all possible values of confounding feature,
significantly increasing the time cost. To address the efficiency challenge, we
further propose a mixture-of experts (MoE) model architecture, modeling each
value of confounding feature with a separate expert module. Through this way,
we retain the model expressiveness with few additional costs. We demonstrate
DCR on the backbone model of neural factorization machine (NFM), showing that
DCR leads to more accurate prediction of user preference with small inference

design. The linguistic patterns and their corresponding antipatterns are hence
contrasting pairs. We propose the SARAv2 (Semantic Analysis of REST APIs

return, such models often involve large graphs which are expensive to simulate

  By combining the reinforcement learning philosophy with reduced models, we
propose a numerical approach to determine optimal health policies for a
stochastic epidemiological graph-model taking into account super-spreaders.
More precisely, we introduce a deterministic reduced population-based model
involving a neural network, and use it to derive optimal health policies
through an optimal control approach. It is meant to faithfully mimic the local
dynamics of the original, more complex, graph-model. Roughly speaking, this is
achieved by sequentially training the network until an optimal control strategy
for the corresponding reduced model manages to equally well contain the
epidemic when simulated on the graph-model.
  After describing the practical implementation of this approach, we will
discuss the range of applicability of the reduced model and to what extent the
estimated control strategies could provide useful qualitative information to
health authorities.

machine learning algorithm to automatically predict the circulatory state
during cardiopulmonary resuscitation from 4-second-long snippets of
accelerometry and electrocardiogram (ECG) data from pauses of chest
compressions of real-world defibrillator records. The algorithm was trained
based on 422 cases from the German Resuscitation Registry, for which ground
truth labels were created by a manual annotation of physicians. It uses a
kernelized Support Vector Machine classifier based on 49 features, which
partially reflect the correlation between accelerometry and electrocardiogram
data. Results: Evaluating 50 different test-training data splits, the proposed
algorithm exhibits a balanced accuracy of 81.2%, a sensitivity of 80.6%, and a
specificity of 81.8%, whereas using only ECG leads to a balanced accuracy of
76.5%, a sensitivity of 80.2%, and a specificity of 72.8%. Conclusion: The
first method employing accelerometry for pulse/no-pulse decision yields a
significant increase in performance compared to single ECG-signal usage.
Significance: This shows that accelerometry provides relevant information for

simplify retrospective annotation for quality management and, moreover, to
support clinicians to assess circulatory state during cardiac arrest treatment.

information about themselves. While the action of sharing is simple, it
requires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to
share, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to
be shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal
assistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and
recommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content
that a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and
highly personal. Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not
address these aspects of privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant
should be able to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering
that user's privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal assistant should be
able to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make
the decision on her own. Accordingly, this paper proposes a personal assistant
that uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy
label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can
model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not
know the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty
is high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk
factors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its
recommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal assistant using a
well-known data set. Our results show that our personal assistant can
accurately identify uncertain cases, personalize them to its user's needs, and
thus helps users preserve their privacy well.

leads to systematic categorization of one-loop neutrino mass models. All
one-loop neutrino mass models must fall in one of these categories. Among these
topological categories, loop extension of canonical seesaw scenarios is
interesting in light of the current LHC run. Apart from one-loop contribution,
these extensions result in dominant tree-level contribution to neutrino masses.
The immediate remedy to obtain dominant one-loop contribution requires
combination of flavor symmetries and enlarged field content. Alternatively, in
this work, we propose a minimal way of realizing the topological structures
with dominant one-loop contribution using modular variant of the permutation
symmetries. In such a realization, no new fields are needed apart from those
permitted by the topology itself. For the first time, we have realized one such
topological Lorentz structure(T4-2-$i$) pertaining to one-loop extension of
Type-II seesaw using modular A$_4$ symmetry. Here, modular weights play an
important role in suppressing tree-level terms and stabilizing the particles
running in the loop($N_i$, $\rho$ and $\phi$), thus, making them suitable dark
matter candidates. In this work, we have explored the possibility of fermionic
dark matter candidate where right-handed neutrino ($N_1$) is assumed to be

oscillation data and obtained model predictions for effective Majorana mass
$M_{ee}$ and $CP$ violation. Furthermore, the predictions on relic density of

into structure (glyph) and texture (noise) components by generative models, and
then aligns handprinted and scanned data in structure feature space such that
the negative influence caused by serious noises can be avoided when adapting.
Second, transformation is achieved via swapping the learned textures across
domains and a classifier for final classification is trained to predict the
labels of the transformed scanned characters. This not only guarantees the
absolute separation, but also enhances the discriminative ability of the

outperforms other adaptation methods and successfully improves recognition

each ball must choose between two random bins $i, j \in [n]$ that it has been
assigned to. It has been known for more than two decades, that if each ball
follows the Greedy strategy (i.e., always pick the less-full bin), then the
maximum load will be $m/n + O(\log \log n)$ with high probability in $n$ (and
$m / n + O(\log m)$ with high probability in $m$). It has remained open whether
the same bounds hold in the dynamic version of the same game, where balls are
inserted/deleted with up to $m$ balls present at a time.
  We show that these bounds do not hold in the dynamic setting: already on $4$
bins, there exists a sequence of insertions/deletions that cause {Greedy} to
incur a maximum load of $m/4 + \Omega(\sqrt{m})$ with probability $\Omega(1)$
-- this is the same bound as if each ball is simply assigned to a random bin!
  This raises the question of whether any 2-choice allocation strategy can
offer a strong bound in the dynamic setting. Our second result answers this
question in the affirmative: we present a new strategy, called ModulatedGreedy,
that guarantees a maximum load of $m / n + O(\log m)$, at any given moment,
with high probability in $m$. Generalizing ModulatedGreedy, we obtain dynamic
guarantees for the $(1 + \beta)$-choice setting, and for the setting of
balls-and-bins on a graph.
  Finally, we consider a setting in which balls can be reinserted after they
are deleted, and where the pair $i, j$ that a given ball uses is consistent
across insertions. This seemingly small modification renders tight load
balancing impossible: on 4 bins, any strategy that is oblivious to the specific
identities of balls must allow for a maximum load of $m/4 + poly(m)$ at some
point in the first $poly(m)$ insertions/deletions, with high probability in
$m$.

representations of entities and relations tailored towards the link prediction

current approaches on benchmark datasets. However, this effectiveness often
comes with the cost of over-parameterization and increased computationally
complexity. The former induces extensive hyperparameter optimization to
mitigate malicious overfitting. The latter magnifies the importance of winning
the hardware lottery. Here, we investigate a remedy for the first problem. We
propose a technique based on Kronecker decomposition to reduce the number of
parameters in a knowledge graph embedding model, while retaining its
expressiveness. Through Kronecker decomposition, large embedding matrices are
split into smaller embedding matrices during the training process. Hence,
embeddings of knowledge graphs are not plainly retrieved but reconstructed on
the fly. The decomposition ensures that elementwise interactions between three
embedding vectors are extended with interactions within each embedding vector.
This implicitly reduces redundancy in embedding vectors and encourages feature
reuse. To quantify the impact of applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding
matrices, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our
experiments suggest that applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding matrices
leads to an improved parameter efficiency on all benchmark datasets. Moreover,
empirical evidence suggests that reconstructed embeddings entail robustness
against noise in the input knowledge graph. To foster reproducible research, we
provide an open-source implementation of our approach, including training and

deploying a strategy of online physics-based corrections. Specifically, we
condition the posterior predictions of our probabilistic predictions to satisfy
partial equilibrium at the microscale, at the inference stage. This is done

alleviate the effect of undesirable biases observed in the outputs of the

observations obtained with VLT/MUSE in 2017. Using spectro-images and position
velocity diagrams extracted from the MUSE data cube, we investigated the number
and positions of the jet knots. A comparison was made to X-Shooter data
collected in 2012 and the knot proper motions were estimated. The jet width and
jet axis position with distance from the star were studied from the extracted

undetected knots. Measurements of the jet axis position reveal a similar
pattern of deviation in all forbidden emission lines along the first 20 arc

shocks and not due to a wiggling of the jet axis. The number of new knots
detected and their positions challenge the 16-year knot ejection periodicity
proposed in prior studies, arguing for a more complicated jet system than was

demand periods requires the determination of replenishment order quantities in

demand and supply for each demand period. In grocery retailing, perishable
goods without best-before-dates further amplify the degree of uncertainty due
to stochastic spoilage. Assuming a lead time of multiple days, the inventory at
the beginning of each demand period is determined jointly by the realisations
of these stochastic variables. While existing contributions in the literature
focus on the role of single components only, we propose to integrate all of
them into a joint framework, explicitly modelling demand, supply shortages, and
spoilage using suitable probability distributions learned from historic data.
As the resulting optimisation problem is analytically intractable in general,
we use a stochastic lookahead policy incorporating Monte Carlo techniques to
fully propagate the associated uncertainties in order to derive replenishment
order quantities. We develop a general inventory management framework and
analyse the benefit of modelling each source of uncertainty with an appropriate

weak generalizability. That is often due to the standard i.i.d. assumption on
the underlying dataset. Recently, three levels of generalization for KGQA were
defined, namely i.i.d., compositional, zero-shot. We analyze 25 well-known KGQA
datasets for 5 different Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We show that according to this
definition many existing and online available KGQA datasets are either not
suited to train a generalizable KGQA system or that the datasets are based on
discontinued and out-dated KGs. Generating new datasets is a costly process
and, thus, is not an alternative to smaller research groups and companies. In
this work, we propose a mitigation method for re-splitting available KGQA
datasets to enable their applicability to evaluate generalization, without any
cost and manual effort. We test our hypothesis on three KGQA datasets, i.e.,
LC-QuAD, LC-QuAD 2.0 and QALD-9). Experiments on re-splitted KGQA datasets
demonstrate its effectiveness towards generalizability. The code and a unified
way to access 18 available datasets is online at

  flow: deformability-driven chaining and repulsion","20 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the interaction-induced migration of bubbles in shear flow and
observe that bubbles suspended in elastoviscoplastic emulsions organise into
chains aligned in the flow direction, similarly to particles in viscoelastic
fluids. To investigate the driving mechanism, we perform experiments and
simulations on bubble pairs, using suspending fluids with different rheological
properties. First, we notice that, for all fluids, the interaction type depends
on the relative position of the bubbles. If they are aligned in the vorticity
direction, they repel, if not, they attract each other. The simulations show a
similar behavior in Newtonian fluids as in viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic
fluids, as long as the capillary number is sufficiently large. This shows that
the interaction-related migration of the bubbles is strongly affected by the
bubble deformation. We suggest that the cause of migration is the interaction
between the heterogeneous pressure fields around the deformed bubbles, due to
capillary pressure.

promising platform for x-ray quantum optics. A key feature is that the joint
nuclei-cavity system can be considered as an artificial x-ray multi-level
scheme in the low-excitation regime. Using the cavity environment, the
structure and parameters of such level schemes can be tailored beyond those
offered by the bare nuclei. However, so far, the direct determination of a
cavity structure providing a desired quantum optical functionality has remained
an open challenge. Here, we address this challenge using an inverse design
methodology. As a first qualitative result, we show that the established
fitting approach based on scattering observables in general is not unique,
since the analysis may lead to different multi-level systems for the same
cavity if based on observables in different scattering channels. Motivated by
this, we distinguish between scattering signatures and the microscopic level
scheme as separate design objectives, with the latter being uniquely determined
by an \textit{ab initio} approach. We find that both design objectives are of
practical relevance and that they complement each other regarding potential
applications. We demonstrate the inverse design for both objectives using
example tasks, such as realising electromagnetically induced transparency. Our
results pave the way for new applications in nuclear quantum optics involving
more complex x-ray cavity designs.

the performance of it by using a stochastic Lyapunov function, where the
stability of $c$-martingales is particularly developed to handle the challenges
brought by the general model of noises and the event-triggering mechanism. The
proposed event-based synchronization algorithm is then applied to solve the
problem of distributed estimation in sensor network. Specifically, by
losslessly decomposing the optimal Kalman filter, it is shown that the problem
of distributed estimation can be resolved by using the algorithms designed for
achieving the synchronization of stochastic linear systems. As such, an
event-based distributed estimation algorithm is developed, where each sensor
performs local filtering solely using its own measurement, together with the
proposed event-based synchronization algorithm to fuse the local estimates of
neighboring nodes. With the reduced communication frequency, the designed
estimator is proved to be stable under the minimal requirements of network

improve latency of Neural Machine Translation models by constraining the set of
allowed output words during inference. The chosen set is typically determined
by separately trained alignment model parameters, independent of the
source-sentence context at inference time. While vocabulary selection appears
competitive with respect to automatic quality metrics in prior work, we show
that it can fail to select the right set of output words, particularly for
semantically non-compositional linguistic phenomena such as idiomatic
expressions, leading to reduced translation quality as perceived by humans.
Trading off latency for quality by increasing the size of the allowed set is
often not an option in real-world scenarios. We propose a model of vocabulary
selection, integrated into the neural translation model, that predicts the set
of allowed output words from contextualized encoder representations. This
restores translation quality of an unconstrained system, as measured by human
evaluations on WMT newstest2020 and idiomatic expressions, at an inference
latency competitive with alignment-based selection using aggressive thresholds,
thereby removing the dependency on separately trained alignment models.

vehicles are still powered by conventional internal combustion engines, the
progress of adopting emerging vehicle technologies will critically depend on
how soon the existing vehicles are transacted out of the household fleet.
Leveraging a nationally representative longitudinal data set, the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics, this study examines how household decisions to dispose of
or replace a given vehicle are: (1) influenced by the vehicle's attributes, (2)
mediated by households' concurrent socio-demographic and economic attributes,
and (3) triggered by key life cycle events. Coupled with a newly developed
machine learning interpretation tool, TreeExplainer, we demonstrate an
innovative use of machine learning models to augment traditional logit modeling
to both generate behavioral insights and improve model performance. We find the
two gradient-boosting-based methods, CatBoost and LightGBM, are the best
performing machine learning models for this problem. The multinomial logistic
model can achieve similar performance levels after its model specification is
informed by TreeExplainer. Both machine learning and multinomial logit models
suggest that while older vehicles are more likely to be disposed of or replaced
than newer ones, such probability decreases as the vehicles serve the family
longer. We find that married families, families with higher education levels,
homeowners, and older families tend to keep their vehicles longer. Life events
such as childbirth, residential relocation, and change of household composition
and income are found to increase vehicle disposal and/or replacement. We
provide additional insights on the timing of vehicle replacement or disposal,
in particular, the presence of children and childbirth events are more strongly
associated with vehicle replacement among younger parents.

there is a canonical bijection between their sets of positive steady states,

thriving of our species. However, as we move towards a hybrid human-machine
future, it is still unclear how the introduction of AI agents in our social
interactions will affect this cooperative capacity. Within the context of the
one-shot collective risk dilemma, where enough members of a group must
cooperate in order to avoid a collective disaster, we study the evolutionary
dynamics of cooperation in a hybrid population made of both adaptive and
fixed-behavior agents. Specifically, we show how the first learn to adapt their
behavior to compensate for the behavior of the latter. The less the
(artificially) fixed agents cooperate, the more the adaptive population is
motivated to cooperate, and vice-versa, especially when the risk is higher. By
pinpointing how adaptive agents avoid their share of costly cooperation if the
fixed-behavior agents implement a cooperative policy, our work hints towards an
unbalanced hybrid world. On one hand, this means that introducing cooperative
AI agents within our society might unburden human efforts. Nevertheless, it is
important to note that costless artificial cooperation might not be realistic,
and more than deploying AI systems that carry the cooperative effort, we must
focus on mechanisms that nudge shared cooperation among all members in the
hybrid system.

of all trajectories of a linear time-invariant system in terms of a single,

control. Under the hood, the fundamental lemma works by applying a persistently
exciting input to the system. This ensures that the Hankel matrix of resulting
input/output data has the ""right"" rank, meaning that its columns span the
entire subspace of trajectories. However, such binary rank conditions are known
to be fragile in the sense that a small additive noise could already cause the
Hankel matrix to have full rank. Therefore, in this extended abstract we
present a robust version of the fundamental lemma. The idea behind the approach
is to guarantee certain lower bounds on the singular values of the data Hankel
matrix, rather than mere rank conditions. This is achieved by designing the
inputs of the experiment such that the minimum singular value of a deeper input
Hankel matrix is sufficiently large. This inspires a new quantitative and
robust notion of persistency of excitation. The relevance of the result for
data-driven control will also be highlighted through comparing the predictive

intermittent idle periods, during which ink can evaporate from the nozzle exit.
Inks are usually multicomponent where each component has its own characteristic
evaporation rate resulting in concentration gradients within the ink. These
gradients may directly and indirectly (via Marangoni flows) alter the jetting
process and thereby its reproducibility and the resulting print quality. In the
present work, we study selective evaporation from an inkjet nozzle for
water-glycerol mixtures. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and
numerical simulations, we investigate changes in mixture composition with
drying time. By monitoring the acoustics within the printhead, and subsequently
modeling the system as a mass-spring-damper system, the composition of the
mixture can be obtained as a function of drying time. The results from the
analytical model are validated using numerical simulations of the full fluid
mechanical equations governing the printhead flows and pressure fields.
Furthermore, the numerical simulations reveal that the time independent
concentration gradient we observe in the experiments is due to the steady state
of water flux through the printhead. Finally, we measure the number of drop
formation events required in this system before the mixture concentration
within the nozzle attains the initial (pre-drying) value, and find a stronger
than exponential trend in the number of drop formations required. These results
shed light on the complex physiochemical hydrodynamics associated with the
drying of ink at a printhead nozzle, and help in increasing the stability and
reproducibility of inkjet printing.

high accuracy to provide a variety of services to end-users ranging from
precise geolocation, health monitoring, and handwritten word recognition.
However, this involves the risk of accessing and potentially disclosing
sensitive information of individuals to the apps that may lead to privacy
breaches. In this paper, we aim to minimize privacy leakages that may lead to
user identification on mobile devices through user tracking and
distinguishability while preserving the functionality of apps and services. We
propose a privacy-preserving mechanism that effectively handles the sensor data
fluctuations (e.g., inconsistent sensor readings while walking, sitting, and
running at different times) by formulating the data as time-series modeling and
forecasting. The proposed mechanism also uses the notion of correlated
noise-series against noise filtering attacks from an adversary, which aims to
filter out the noise from the perturbed data to re-identify the original data.
Unlike existing solutions, our mechanism keeps running in isolation without the
interaction of a user or a service provider. We perform rigorous experiments on
benchmark datasets and show that our proposed mechanism limits user tracking
and distinguishability threats to a significant extent compared to the original
data while maintaining a reasonable level of utility of functionalities. In
general, we show that our obfuscation mechanism reduces the user trackability
threat by 60\% across all the datasets while maintaining the utility loss below
0.5 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also observe that our mechanism is more
effective in large datasets. For example, with the Swipes dataset, the
distinguishability risk is reduced by 60\% on average while the utility loss is
below 0.5 MAE.

verification of asteroseismology in the low metallicity regime.
  As M4 is an old GC, it hosts multiple stellar populations differing in
light-element abundances and in helium mass fraction. This generates a mass
difference between the populations along the RGB, which in the case of M4 is
estimated to be $0.017 M_\odot$. With this wealth of information we can assign
population membership and estimate the average mass of the stellar populations,
but the current uncertainties do not allow us to resolve this mass difference.
The population membership and the seismic data of RGB and HB stars, allow us,
however, to assess the integrated mass loss along the RGB of the first

intrinsic shifts from other emission lines. We inject Gaussian random redshift
errors into the mock quasar catalogues, and measure the auto-correlation and

negligible. However, we see a significant unphysical correlation for small

from the cybersecurity community as a way to collaboratively train deep
learning models with distributed profiles of cyberthreats, with no disclosure
of training data. Nevertheless, the adoption of FL in cybersecurity is still in
its infancy, and a range of practical aspects have not been properly addressed
yet. Indeed, the Federated Averaging algorithm at the core of the FL concept
requires the availability of test data to control the FL process. Although this
might be feasible in some domains, test network traffic of newly discovered
attacks cannot be always shared without disclosing sensitive information. In
this paper, we address the convergence of the FL process in dynamic
cybersecurity scenarios, where the trained model must be frequently updated
with new recent attack profiles to empower all members of the federation with
latest detection features. To this aim, we propose FLAD (adaptive Federated
Learning Approach to DDoS attack detection), a FL solution for cybersecurity
applications based on an adaptive mechanism that orchestrates the FL process by
dynamically assigning more computation to those members whose attacks profiles
are harder to learn, without the need of sharing any test data to monitor the
performance of the trained model. Using a recent dataset of DDoS attacks, we
demonstrate that FLAD outperforms the original FL algorithm in terms of
convergence time and accuracy across a range of unbalanced datasets of
heterogeneous DDoS attacks. We also show the robustness of our approach in a
realistic scenario, where we retrain the deep learning model multiple times to
introduce the profiles of new attacks on a pre-trained model.

full magnetic cycle of solar magnetograms to model the coronal structure and
prominence distribution in a young Sun, where we scale the field strength in
the magnetograms with angular velocity according to $ B \propto \Omega^{-1.32}
$. We reproduce both the observed prominence masses and their scatter. We show
that both the field strength and the field geometry contribute to the
prominence masses that can be supported and to the rate at which they are
ejected. Predicted prominence masses follow the magnetic cycle, but with half
the period, peaking both at cycle maximum and at cycle minimum. We show that
mass loss rates in prominences are less than those predicted for the stellar
wind. We also investigate the role of small-scale field that may be unresolved
in typical stellar magnetograms. This provides only a small reduction in the
predicted total prominence mass, principally by reducing the number of large
magnetic loops that can support slingshot prominences. We conclude that the
observed scatter in prominence masses can be explained by underlying magnetic
cycles.

stochastic optimization due to `multiplicative noise', even under surprisingly
simple settings, such as linear regression with Gaussian data. While these
studies have uncovered several interesting phenomena, they consider
conventional stochastic optimization problems, which exclude decentralized
settings that naturally arise in modern machine learning applications. In this
paper, we study the emergence of heavy-tails in decentralized stochastic
gradient descent (DE-SGD), and investigate the effect of decentralization on
the tail behavior. We first show that, when the loss function at each
computational node is twice continuously differentiable and strongly convex
outside a compact region, the law of the DE-SGD iterates converges to a
distribution with polynomially decaying (heavy) tails. To have a more explicit
control on the tail exponent, we then consider the case where the loss at each
node is a quadratic, and show that the tail-index can be estimated as a
function of the step-size, batch-size, and the topological properties of the
network of the computational nodes. Then, we provide theoretical and empirical
results showing that DE-SGD has heavier tails than centralized SGD. We also
compare DE-SGD to disconnected SGD where nodes distribute the data but do not
communicate. Our theory uncovers an interesting interplay between the tails and
the network structure: we identify two regimes of parameters (stepsize and
network size), where DE-SGD can have lighter or heavier tails than disconnected
SGD depending on the regime. Finally, to support our theoretical results, we
provide numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic data and neural

termed as DRBM-ClustNet is proposed. This core-clustering engine consists of a
Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM) for processing unlabeled data by
creating new features that are uncorrelated and have large variance with each
other. Next, the number of clusters are predicted using the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), followed by a Kohonen Network-based clustering
layer. The processing of unlabeled data is done in three stages for efficient
clustering of the non-linearly separable datasets. In the first stage, DRBM
performs non-linear feature extraction by capturing the highly complex data
representation by projecting the feature vectors of $d$ dimensions into $n$
dimensions. Most clustering algorithms require the number of clusters to be
decided a priori, hence here to automate the number of clusters in the second
stage we use BIC. In the third stage, the number of clusters derived from BIC
forms the input for the Kohonen network, which performs clustering of the
feature-extracted data obtained from the DRBM. This method overcomes the
general disadvantages of clustering algorithms like the prior specification of
the number of clusters, convergence to local optima and poor clustering
accuracy on non-linear datasets. In this research we use two synthetic
datasets, fifteen benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository,
and four image datasets to analyze the DRBM-ClustNet. The proposed framework is
evaluated based on clustering accuracy and ranked against other
state-of-the-art clustering methods. The obtained results demonstrate that the
DRBM-ClustNet outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

slower decorrelation of the vertical velocity component as compared to the
horizontal one. At short times, in the ballistic regime, this result can be
interpreted by considering pairs of different orientations at the release time,
and is a signature of the anisotropy of Eulerian second-order functions.
Rotation also enhances the distortion of triads and tetrads also present in

of triads and tetrads is shown to be preferentially aligned with the rotation

over all feature dimensions. This is accomplished by introducing a notion of
cross-network logit computed through passing student's representation into

interesting connection between knowledge distillation with open-set

sections for knocking out high-momentum protons in photo-absorption on nuclei.
This is within a framework we characterize as exhibiting high renormalization
group (RG) resolution. Assuming a one-body reaction operator, the nuclear wave
function must include two-body short-range correlations (SRCs) with
deuteron-like quantum numbers. In a previous paper, we showed that SRC physics
can be naturally accounted for at low RG resolution. Here we describe the
quasi-deuteron model at low RG resolution and determine the Levinger constant,
which is proportional to the ratio of nuclear photo-absorption to that for
photo-disintegration of a deuteron. We extract the Levinger constant based on
the ratio of momentum distributions at high relative momentum. We compute
momentum distributions evolved under similarity RG (SRG) transformations, where
the SRC physics is shifted into the operator as a universal two-body term. The
short-range nature of this operator motivates using local-density
approximations with uncorrelated wave functions in evaluating nuclear matrix
elements, which greatly simplifies the analysis. The operator must be
consistently matched to the RG scale and scheme of the interaction for a
reliable extraction. We apply SRG transformations to different nucleon-nucleon
(NN) interactions and use the deuteron wave functions and Weinberg eigenvalues
to determine approximate matching scales. We predict the Levinger constant for
several NN interactions and a wide range of nuclei comparing to experimental
extractions. The predictions at low RG resolution are in good agreement with
experiment when starting with a hard NN interaction and the initial operator.
Similar agreement is found using soft NN interactions when the additional
two-body operator induced by evolution from hard to soft is included.

anomalies are those observations-under appropriate random variable

  In this paper, we introduce our decompilation approach dewolf. We developed a
variety of improvements over the previous academic state-of-the-art decompiler

fact, the few cases where dewolf already cracks this rule lead to its results
considerably exceeding other decompilers. We publish a prototype implementation

overall Q-value of the network. Additionally, to improve the stability of the
approach, we have utilized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) approach where overall
reward and action entropy is maximized, simultaneously. The immediate reward
has been defined based on the soft weighted summation of the rate of all the
users. The soft weighting is based on the achieved rate and allocated power of
each user. Furthermore, the channel responses between the users and base
station (BS) is defined as the state of environment, while action space is
involved of the digital and analog beamforming weights and allocated power to
each user. The simulation results represent the superiority of the proposed
approach rather than the Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Non-Line of
Sight (NLOS)-NOMA in terms of sum-rate of the users. It's outperformance is
caused by the joint optimization and independency of the proposed approach to
the channel responses.

  Supply Chains",,,,,"cs.DB cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semiconductor supply chains are described by significant demand fluctuation
that increases as one moves up the supply chain, the so-called bullwhip effect.
To counteract, semiconductor manufacturers aim to optimize capacity
utilization, to deliver with shorter lead times and exploit this to generate
revenue. Additionally, in a competitive market, firms seek to maintain customer
relationships while applying revenue management strategies such as dynamic
pricing. Price change potentially generates conflicts with customers. In this
paper, we present KnowGraph-PM, a knowledge graph-based dynamic pricing model.
The semantic model uses the potential of faster delivery and shorter lead times
to define premium prices, thus entail increased profits based on the customer
profile. The knowledge graph enables the integration of customer-related
information, e.g., customer class and location to customer order data. The
pricing algorithm is realized as a SPARQL query that relies on customer profile
and order behavior to determine the corresponding price premium. We evaluate
the approach by calculating the revenue generated after applying the pricing
algorithm. Based on competency questions that translate to SPARQL queries, we
validate the created knowledge graph. We demonstrate that semantic data
integration enables customer-tailored revenue management.

hole. In particular, we constrain the parameter $\alpha=1/\lambda$ which
appears in the Born-Infeld $f(T)$ model. In the strong gravity regime we find
that the shadow radius increases with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$.
Specifically, from the S2 star observations, we find within 1$\sigma$ that the

Consequently, we used the best fit parameters to model the shadow images of Sgr
A$^{\star}$ black hole and then using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we analysed the
deflection angle for leading order expansions of the parameter $\alpha$. It is
found that within the parameter range, these observables are very close to the
Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, using the best fit parameters for the
Born-Infeld $f(T)$ model we show the angular diameter is consistent with recent
observations for the Sgr A$^{\star}$ black hole angular diameter $(51.8 \pm
2.3) \mu$arcsec and difficult to be distinguished from the GR. For the
deflection angle of light, in leading order terms, we find that the deflection
angle expressed in the ADM mass coincides with the GR, but the ADM mass in the
Born-Infeld $f(T)$ gravity increases with the increase of $\alpha$ and the
overall deflection angle is expected to me greater in $f(T)$ gravity. As a
consequence of this fact, we have shown that the electromagnetic intensity
observed in shadow images is smaller compared to GR.

The traditional multi-ship air defense model does not consider the coordination
between ships, and the model assumptions are often too simple to effectively
describe the capabilities of the multi-ship cooperative air defense system in
realistic combat scenarios. In response to the above problems, this paper
proposes a multi-ship cooperative air defense model, which effectively
integrates the attack and defense parameters of both sides such as missile
launch rate, missile flight speed, missile launch direction, ship interception
rate, ship interception range, and the number of ship interception fire units.
Then, the cooperative interception capability among ships is modeled by the
method of task assignment. Based on the queuing theory, this paper strictly
deduces the penetration probability of the cooperative air defense system, and
provides an analytical calculation model for the analysis and design of the
cooperative air defense system. Finally, through simulation experiments in
typical scenarios, this paper studies and compares the air defense capabilities
of the system in two different modes with and without coordination, and
verifies the superiority of the multi-ship cooperative air defense model in
reducing the probability of missile penetration; Further, the ability changes
of the defense system under different parameters such as missile speed, speed,

transfer learning-based FSL, sophisticated pre-training methods have been
widely studied for universal representation. Therefore, it has become more
important to utilize the universal representation for downstream tasks, but
there are few studies on fine-tuning in FSL. In this paper, we focus on how to
transfer pre-trained models to few-shot downstream tasks from the three

compare the two popular update methods, full fine-tuning (i.e., updating the
entire network, FT) and linear probing (i.e., updating only a linear
classifier, LP). We find that LP is better than FT with extremely few samples,
whereas FT outperforms LP as training samples increase. Next, we show that data
augmentation cannot guarantee few-shot performance improvement and investigate
the effectiveness of data augmentation based on the intensity of augmentation.
Finally, we adopt augmentation to both a support set for update (i.e., data
augmentation) as well as a query set for prediction (i.e., test-time
augmentation), considering support-query distribution shifts, and improve

Across various scientific disciplines, machine learning has advanced as the

used as universal function approximators for data with underlying mechanisms
that are incompletely understood or exceedingly complex. However, neural
networks alone ignore the fundamental laws of physics and often fail to make
plausible predictions. Here we integrate data, physics, and uncertainties by
combining neural networks, physics-informed modeling, and Bayesian inference to
improve the predictive potential of traditional neural network models. We embed
the physical model of a damped harmonic oscillator into a fully-connected
feed-forward neural network to explore a simple and illustrative model system,
the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. Our Physics-Informed Neural Networks can
seamlessly integrate data and physics, robustly solve forward and inverse

small amount of noisy and incomplete data. At only minor additional cost, they
can self-adaptively learn the weighting between data and physics. Combined with
Bayesian Neural Networks, they can serve as priors in a Bayesian Inference, and
provide credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. Our study reveals
the inherent advantages and disadvantages of Neural Networks, Bayesian
Inference, and a combination of both and provides valuable guidelines for model
selection. While we have only demonstrated these approaches for the simple

sufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. We
proposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position
information in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring
anatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Two
scenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.
U-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape
information for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were
incorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues to
mitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT images
with their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,
validation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks
led to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian
distance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of the
ground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomes
indicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded
through global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to
significantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT images
in small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and
1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.
The findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building
generalizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.

with good sensitivity, we can pool statistical evidence over all pairwise
comparisons. Here we describe a wide range of statistical tests of exemplar
discriminability and assess the validity (specificity) and power (sensitivity)
of each test. The tests include previously used and novel, parametric and
nonparametric tests, which treat subject as a random or fixed effect, and are
based on different dissimilarity measures, different test statistics, and
different inference procedures. We use simulated and real data to determine
which tests are valid and which are most sensitive. A popular test statistic
reflecting exemplar information is the exemplar discriminability index (EDI),
which is defined as the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates between
different exemplars minus the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates
between repetitions of identical exemplars. The popular across-subject t test
of the EDI (typically using correlation distance as the pattern dissimilarity

Earth's magnetic field which arise from the interaction of the solar wind with
Earth's magnetosphere, and drive catastrophic destruction to our
technologically dependent society. Hence, computational models to forecast GICs
globally with large forecast horizon, high spatial resolution and temporal
cadence are of increasing importance to perform prompt necessary mitigation.
Since GIC data is proprietary, the time variability of horizontal component of
the magnetic field perturbation (dB/dt) is used as a proxy for GICs. In this
work, we develop a fast, global dB/dt forecasting model, which forecasts 30
minutes into the future using only solar wind measurements as input. The model
summarizes 2 hours of solar wind measurement using a Gated Recurrent Unit, and
generates forecasts of coefficients which are folded with a spherical harmonic
basis to enable global forecasts. When deployed, our model produces results in
under a second, and generates global forecasts for horizontal magnetic
perturbation components at 1-minute cadence. We evaluate our model across
models in literature for two specific storms of 5 August 2011 and 17 March
2015, while having a self-consistent benchmark model set. Our model
outperforms, or has consistent performance with state-of-the-practice high time
cadence local and low time cadence global models, while also
outperforming/having comparable performance with the benchmark models. Such
quick inferences at high temporal cadence and arbitrary spatial resolutions may
ultimately enable accurate forewarning of dB/dt for any place on Earth,
resulting in precautionary measures to be taken in an informed manner.

symbols. Despite this, we propose that symbols are manufactured simply by
training a sparse random noise as a self-sustaining attractor in a feedback
spiking neural network. This way, we can generate many of what we shall call
prime attractors, and the networks that support them are like registers holding
a symbolic value, and we call them registers. Like symbols, prime attractors
are atomic and devoid of any internal structure. Moreover, the winner-take-all
mechanism naturally implemented by spiking neurons enables registers to recover
a prime attractor within a noisy signal. Using this faculty, when considering
two connected registers, an input one and an output one, it is possible to bind
in one shot using a Hebbian rule the attractor active on the output to the
attractor active on the input. Thus, whenever an attractor is active on the
input, it induces its bound attractor on the output; even though the signal
gets blurrier with more bindings, the winner-take-all filtering faculty can
recover the bound prime attractor. However, the capacity is still limited. It
is also possible to unbind in one shot, restoring the capacity taken by that
binding. This mechanism serves as a basis for working memory, turning prime
attractors into variables. Also, we use a random second-order network to
amalgamate the prime attractors held by two registers to bind the prime
attractor held by a third register to them in one shot, de facto implementing a
hash table. Furthermore, we introduce the register switch box composed of
registers to move the content of one register to another. Then, we use spiking
neurons to build a toy symbolic computer based on the above. The technics used
suggest ways to design extrapolating, reusable, sample-efficient deep learning
networks at the cost of structural priors.

gates underlap regions on both sides of the organic semiconductor. The parallel
immobilization of biomolecule in two gates underlaps region changes the
on-current (ION) of the DMDGBEOTFT. Bilayer electrode is also used for
significant reduction of barrier height to enhance the performance of the
proposed device. The change in the drain current has been utilized to evaluate
the sensitivity of the DMDGBE-OTFT for biomolecule recognition having different
dielectric constants and corresponding charge densities using 2-D physics-based
numerical simulation when biomolecules are immobilized in the gate underlap
area. The ATLAS TCAD tool is used to investigate the sensitivity performance of
the DMDGBE-OTFT. The proposed DMDGBE-OTFT has 24.2% higher sensitivity in
comparison to the recently reported OTFT-based biosensors for label-free
detection of biomolecules. The DMDGBE-OTFT biosensor has a lot of potential for
flexible biosensing applications in the future because of its flexibility, high
sensitivity, biocompatibility and low cost.

text-to-image generation is creative. This paper expounds on the nature of
human creativity involved in text-to-image art (so-called ""AI art"") with a
specific focus on the practice of prompt engineering. The paper argues that the
current product-centered view of creativity falls short in the context of
text-to-image generation. A case exemplifying this shortcoming is provided and
the importance of online communities for the creative ecosystem of
text-to-image art is highlighted. The paper provides a high-level summary of
this online ecosystem drawing on Rhodes' conceptual four P model of creativity.
Challenges for evaluating the creativity of text-to-image generation and
opportunities for research on text-to-image generation in the field of

applications in healthcare, space exploration, banking and finance. These rapid
progresses in AI have brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of
AI technologies on society, with ethically questionable consequences. In recent
years, several ethical principles have been released by governments, national
and international organisations. These principles outline high-level precepts
to guide the ethical development, deployment, and governance of AI. However,
the abstract nature, diversity, and context-dependency of these principles make
them difficult to implement and operationalize, resulting in gaps between
principles and their execution. Most recent work analysed and summarized
existing AI principles and guidelines but they did not provide findings on
principle-implementation gaps and how to mitigate them. These findings are
particularly important to ensure that AI implementations are aligned with
ethical principles and values. In this paper, we provide a contextual and
global evaluation of current ethical AI principles for all continents, with the
aim to identify potential principle characteristics tailored to specific
countries or applicable across countries. Next, we analyze the current level of
AI readiness and current implementations of ethical AI principles in different
countries, to identify gaps in the implementation of AI principles and their
causes. Finally, we propose recommendations to mitigate the
principle-implementation gaps.

severe disease, and death. Most of the evidence that COVID-19 vaccines also
reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is based on retrospective, observational
studies. Specifically, an increasing number of studies are evaluating vaccine
efficacy against the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 using data available
in existing healthcare databases or contact tracing databases. Since these
types of databases were designed for clinical diagnosis or management of
COVID-19, they are limited in their ability to provide accurate information on
infection, infection timing, and transmission events. In this manuscript, we
highlight challenges with using existing databases to identify transmission
units and confirm potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission events. We discuss the
impact of common diagnostic testing strategies including event-prompted and
infrequent testing and illustrate their potential biases in estimating vaccine
efficacy against the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2. We articulate the
need for prospective observational studies of vaccine efficacy against the
SARS-CoV-2 SAR, and we provide design and reporting considerations for studies
using retrospective databases.

$\beta$-subsethood degree, which are generalizations of degree of intersection
and subsethood degree, respectively. And then, the axiom set for each of these

Thirdly, we give the matrix representations of three types of $L$-fuzzy
$\beta$-covering-based rough approximation operators, which make it valid to
calculate the $L$-fuzzy $\beta$-covering-based lower and upper rough
approximation operators through operations on matrices. Finally, the
interdependency of the three pairs of rough approximation operators based on

and independent elements. In other words, we present the necessary and
sufficient conditions under which two $L$-fuzzy $\beta$-coverings can generate
