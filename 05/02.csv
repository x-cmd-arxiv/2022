  Extraction","Accpeted by IJCAI 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Implicit event argument extraction (EAE) aims to identify arguments that
could scatter over the document. Most previous work focuses on learning the
direct relations between arguments and the given trigger, while the implicit
relations with long-range dependency are not well studied. Moreover, recent
neural network based approaches rely on a large amount of labeled data for
training, which is unavailable due to the high labelling cost. In this paper,
we propose a Curriculum learning based Prompt tuning (CUP) approach, which
resolves implicit EAE by four learning stages. The stages are defined according
to the relations with the trigger node in a semantic graph, which well captures
the long-range dependency between arguments and the trigger. In addition, we
integrate a prompt-based encoder-decoder model to elicit related knowledge from
pre-trained language models (PLMs) in each stage, where the prompt templates
are adapted with the learning progress to enhance the reasoning for arguments.
Experimental results on two well-known benchmark datasets show the great
advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we outperform the
state-of-the-art models in both fully-supervised and low-data scenarios.

Humans instinctively rely on fine-grained audio events as well as the overall
sound characteristics to distinguish diverse acoustic scenes. Yet, most
previous approaches treat acoustic scene classification (ASC) and audio event
classification (AEC) as two independent tasks. A few studies on scene and event
joint classification either use synthetic audio datasets that hardly match the
real world, or simply use the multi-task framework to perform two tasks at the
same time. Neither of these two ways makes full use of the implicit and
inherent relation between fine-grained events and coarse-grained scenes. To
this end, this paper proposes a relation-guided ASC (RGASC) model to further
exploit and coordinate the scene-event relation for the mutual benefit of scene
and event recognition. The TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes 2018 dataset (TUT2018) is
annotated with pseudo labels of events by a simple and efficient audio-related
pre-trained model PANN, which is one of the state-of-the-art AEC models. Then,
a prior scene-event relation matrix is defined as the average probability of
the presence of each event type in each scene class. Finally, the two-tower
RGASC model is jointly trained on the real-life dataset TUT2018 for both scene
and event classification. The following results are achieved. 1) RGASC
effectively coordinates the true information of coarse-grained scenes and the
pseudo information of fine-grained events. 2) The event embeddings learned from
pseudo labels under the guidance of prior scene-event relations help reduce the
confusion between similar acoustic scenes. 3) Compared with other
(non-ensemble) methods, RGASC improves the scene classification accuracy on the
real-life dataset.

rater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American, LGBTQ,

set of comments, which contains many references to these identity groups. We
found that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters
will annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary
content analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between
rater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we
trained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and
compared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets.
Finally, we discuss how using raters that self-identify with the subjects of

nuanced ratings than those by random raters.

learning on a downstream labeled set. However, catastrophic forgetting of the

learning of action recognition, resulting in a sub-optimal solution. In this

we fix the encoder from the last epoch as the teacher model to guide the

such a simple yet effective learning strategy, we outperform state-of-the-art

inverse kinematics module refines the key point prediction and generates a
posed template mesh. Finally, a UV inpainting module relies on the
corresponding feature, prediction and the posed template, and completes the
predictions of occluded body shape. Our framework leverages the best of

points of EFD is developing a generic model to extract robust and
discriminative features from different equipment for early fault detection.
Most existing EFD methods focus on learning fault representation by one type of
feature. However, a combination of multiple features can capture a more
comprehensive representation of system state. In this paper, we propose an EFD
method based on multiple feature fusion with stacking architecture (M2FSA). The
proposed method can extract generic and discriminiative features to detect
early faults by combining time domain (TD), frequency domain (FD), and
time-frequency domain (TFD) features. In order to unify the dimensions of the
different domain features, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) is utilized to
learn deep features in three domains. The architecture of the proposed M2FSA
consists of two layers. The first layer contains three base models, whose
corresponding inputs are different deep features. The outputs of the first
layer are concatenated to generate the input to the second layer, which
consists of a meta model. The proposed method is tested on three bearing
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than
existing methods both in sensibility and reliability.

cyclotron resonance of relativistic electrons with EMIC waves results in very
fast electron precipitation to the atmosphere. However, wave intensities often
exceed the threshold for nonlinear resonant interaction, and such intense EMIC
waves have been shown to transport electrons away from the loss cone due to the
force bunching effect. In this study we investigate if this transport can block
electron precipitation. We combine test particle simulations, low-altitude
ELFIN observations of EMIC-driven electron precipitation, and ground-based EMIC

operator consists of both local convection-diffusion and nonlocal diffusion
operators. Our numerical scheme is based on the direct approximation of the
nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula that establishes a link between nonlinear PIDEs
and stochastic differential equations. The exploitation of the Feynman-Kac
representation successfully avoids solving dense linear systems arising from
nonlocality operators. Compared with existing stochastic approaches, our method
can achieve first-order convergence after balancing the temporal and spatial
discretization errors, which is a significant improvement of existing
probabilistic/stochastic methods for nonlocal diffusion problems. Error
analysis of our numerical scheme is established. The effectiveness of our
approach is shown in two numerical examples. The first example considers a
three-dimensional nonlocal diffusion equation to numerically verify the error
analysis results. The second example presents a physics problem motivated by
the study of heat transport in magnetically confined fusion plasmas.

developing intelligent transportation systems and has attracted considerable
attention in recent decades. Despite the significant progress in this area
brought by deep learning, challenges remain. Traffic flows usually change
dramatically in a short period, which prevents the current methods from
accurately capturing the future trend and likely causes the over-fitting
problem, leading to unsatisfied accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based method that can forecast the short-term
traffic flow precisely and avoid local optimum problems during training.
Specifically, instead of using the non-stationary raw traffic data directly, we
first decompose them into sub-components, where each one is less noisy than the
original input. Afterward, Sample Entropy (SE) is employed to merge similar
components to reduce the computation cost. The merged features are fed into the
LSTM, and we then introduce a spatiotemporal module to consider the neighboring
relationships in the recombined signals to avoid strong autocorrelation. During
training, we utilize the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) to optimize the parameters
of LSTM, which overcome the overfitting issue. We conduct the experiments on a
UK public highway traffic flow dataset, and the results show that the proposed
method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods with better
adaption performance on extreme outliers, delay effects, and trend-changing
responses.

servers to a job, the speed extracted is $k^{1/\alpha}, \alpha>1$, a
sub-linear, concave speedup function, while in the sequential phase, a job can

include the onset of the reverberation phase for the PWN, by assuming radially

structure of amorphous SiN, a non-stoichiometric compound belonging to the
Si$_x$N$_{y}$ family. To produce the amorphous state via the cooling of the
liquid, both the Car-Parrinello and the Born-Oppenheimer approaches are
exploited to obtain a system featuring sizeable atomic mobility. At high
temperatures, due to the peculiar electronic structure of SiN, exhibiting gap
closing effects, the Car-Parrinello methodology could not be followed since
non-adiabatic effects involving the ionic and electronic degrees of freedom do
occur. This shortcoming was surmounted by resorting to the Born-Oppenheimer
approach allowing to achieve significant ionic diffusion at $T$= 2500 K. From
this highly diffusive sample, an amorphous state at room temperature was
obtained with a quenching rate of 10 K/ps. Four different models were created,
differing by their sizes and the thermal cycles. We found that the subnetwork
of atoms N has the same environment than in the stoichiometric material
Si$_3$N$_4$ since N is mostly threefold coordinated with Si. Si atoms can also
be found coordinated to four N atoms as in Si$_3$N$_4$, but a substantial
fraction of them forms homopolar bonds with one, two, three and even four Si.
Our results are not too dissimilar from former models available in the
litterature but they feature a higher statistical accuracy and refer more
precisely to room temperature as the reference thermodynamical condition for
the analysis of the structure in the amorphous state.

recently developed magnetic methods, such that we can exploit the strong
nuclear interaction. The stronger potential of these prisms allows for the
generation of a tighter lattice. Combined with recent advances in neutron
compound optics and split crystal interferometry our method may be applied to
the generation of intrinsic neutron orbital angular momentum states. Finally,
we assert that, in its current state, our setup is directly applicable to
anisotropic ultra small angle neutron scattering.

across T$ _{C} $ and T$ _{d} $, observed by means of temperature dependent
variation in Ni/Mn-O, Ni-Mn bonding characters and super exchange angle in

upon completion of this task, reconfigure into a spherical ball and roll out.
This dimensional change alters the dynamics of locomotion and can assist them
to maneuver variable terrains. The sphere-plane reconfiguration is equivalent
to projecting a spherical shell onto a plane, an operation which is not
possible without distortions. Fortunately, soft materials have potential to
adapt to this disparity of the Gaussian curvatures. Modular Soft Robots
(MSoRos) have promise of achieving dimensional change by exploiting their
continuum and deformable nature. We present topology and morphology design of
MSoRos capable of reconfiguring between spherical and planar configurations.
Our approach is based in geometry, where a platonic solid determines the number
of modules required for plane-to-sphere reconfiguration and the radius of the
resulting sphere, e.g., four `tetrahedron-based' or six `cube-based' MSoRos are
required for spherical reconfiguration. The methodology involves: (1)inverse
orthographic projection of a `module-topology curve' onto the circumscribing
sphere to generate the spherical topology,(2)azimuthal projection of the
spherical topology onto a tangent plane at the center of the module resulting
in the planar topology, and (3)adjusting the limb stiffness and curling ability
by manipulating the geometry of cavities to realize a physical finite-width,
Motor-Tendon Actuated MSoRo. The topology design is shown to be scale
invariant, i.e., scaling of base platonic solid is reflected linearly in
spherical and planar topologies. The module-topology curve is optimized for the
reconfiguration and locomotion ability using a metric that quantifies
sphere-to-plane distortion. The geometry of the cavity optimizes for the limb
stiffness and curling ability without compromising the actuator's structural
integrity.

find the scaling form and the corresponding scaling function of the position

with a ballistic scaling. We then introduce the resetting dynamics where, at a
constant rate, both the position and the diffusion coefficient are reset to
zero. This eventually leads to a nonequilibrium stationary state, which we
study in arbitrary dimensions. In stark contrast to ordinary Brownian motion
under resetting, the stationary position distribution in one dimension has a
logarithmic divergence at the origin. For higher dimensions, however, the
divergence disappears and the distribution attains a dimension-dependent
constant value at the origin, which we compute exactly. The distribution has a
generic stretched exponential tail in all dimensions.
  We also study the approach to the stationary state and find that, as time
increases, an inner core region around the origin attains the stationary state,
while the outside region still has a transient distribution -- this inner
stationary region grows $\sim t^2$, i.e., with a constant acceleration, much
faster than ordinary Brownian motion.

scalar fields $\chi_{1,2}$ that constitute a bath in thermal equilibrium. For a
range of masses the $\Phi$ propagator features threshold and infrared
divergences, a vanishing residue at the (quasi) particle pole and vanishing
\emph{on-shell} decay rates thereby preventing the equilibration of $\Phi$ with
the bath via on-shell processes. Inspired by the theory of quantum open systems
we obtain a quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix of $\Phi$
that includes the time dependence of bath correlations, yielding time dependent
rates in the dynamics of relaxation and allowing virtual processes of small
virtuality $\propto 1/t$ at long time $t$. These \emph{off-shell} processes
lead to thermalization despite vanishing S-matrix rates. In the case of
threshold divergences we find that a thermal fixed point is approached as
$e^{-\sqrt{t/t^*}}$ with the relaxation time $t^*$ becoming shorter at high
temperature as a consequence of stimulated emission and absorption. In the
infrared case, the thermal fixed point is approached as $e^{-\gamma(t)}$, where
$\gamma(t)$ features a crossover between a $\propto \ln(t)$ and a $\propto t$
behavior for $t \gg 1/T$. The vanishing of the residue and the crossover in
relaxational dynamics in this case is strikingly reminiscent of the

find that with a two-qubit protocol, swap test can efficiently detect the
similarity between two patterns with good fidelity, though for three or more
qubits the noise in the real devices becomes detrimental. To mitigate this
noise effect, we resort to destructive swap test, which shows an improved
performance for three-qubit states. Due to limited cloud access to larger IBMQ
processors, we take a segment-wise approach to apply the destructive swap test
on higher dimensional images. In this case, we define an average overlap
measure which shows faithfulness to distinguish between two very different or
very similar patterns when simulated on real IBMQ processors. As test images,
we use binary images with simple patterns, greyscale MNIST numbers and MNIST
fashion images, as well as binary images of human blood vessel obtained from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also present an experimental set up for
applying destructive swap test using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NVs) in

the right-most lane. In our approach, we learn a mapping from a data-driven
human driver behavior model called the CMetric to a driver's entropic risk
preference. We then use the derived risk preference within a game-theoretic
risk-sensitive planner to model risk-aware interactions among human drivers and
an autonomous vehicle in various traffic scenarios. We demonstrate our method
in a merging scenario, where our results show that the final trajectories
obtained from the risk-aware planner generate desirable emergent behaviors.
Particularly, our planner recognizes aggressive human drivers and yields to
them while maintaining a greater distance from them. In a user study,
participants were able to distinguish between aggressive and conservative
simulated drivers based on trajectories generated from our risk-sensitive
planner. We also observe that aggressive human driving results in more frequent
lane-changing in the planner. Finally, we compare the performance of our
modified risk-aware planner with existing methods and show that modeling human
driver behavior leads to safer navigation.

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. We focused on a late stage merger of
two identical galaxies with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of 10$^8$
M$_\odot$. We found that the infrared luminosity of the system reaches ultra-
and hyper-luminous infrared galaxy classes (10$^{12}$ and 10$^{13}$ L$_\odot$,
respectively). The DOGs phase corresponds to a state in which the AGNs are
buried in dense gas and dust, with the infrared luminosity exceeding 3.3
$\times$ 10$^{12}$ L$_\odot$. We also identified the sub-categories of DOGs,
namely bump and power-law DOGs from the SEDs and their evolution. The bump DOGs
tend to evolve to power-law DOGs on several Myrs. We found that contribution
from the hot dust around the nucleus in the infrared radiation is essential for
identifying the system as a power-law DOG; the gas and dust distribute
non-spherically around the nucleus, therefore, the observed properties of DOGs
depend on the viewing angle. In our model, the lifetime of merger-driven DOGs
is less than 4 Myrs, suggesting that the observed DOGs phase is a brief aspect
of galaxy mergers.

parametrize the linear power spectrum and the growth rate in several $k$ and
$z$ bins. We show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the
expansion rate $E(z)=H(z)/H_0$ and the growth rate $f(k,z)$, besides the bias
functions. We apply the technique to both Euclid and DESI public specifications
in the range $0.6\le z \le 1.8$ and show that the gain in precision when going
from $k_{\rm max} = 0.1$ to $0.2\,h$/Mpc is around two- to threefold, while it
reaches four- to ninefold when extending to $k_{\rm max} = 0.3\,h$/Mpc. In
absolute terms, with $k_{\rm max}=0.2\,h/$Mpc, one can reach high precision on
$E(z)$ at each $z$-shell: 8-10% for DESI with $\Delta z=0.1$, 5-6% for Euclid
with $\Delta z=0.2-0.3$. This improves to 1-2% if the growth rate $f$ is taken
to be $k$-independent. The growth rate itself has in general much weaker
constraints, unless assumed to be $k$-independent, in which case the gain is
similar to the one for $E(z)$ and uncertainties around 5-15% can be reached at
each $z$-bin. We also discuss how neglecting the non-linear corrections can
have a large effect on the constraints even for $k_{\rm max}=0.1\,h/$Mpc,

Budgeted, sequential classifiers (BSCs) address these scenarios by processing
inputs through a sequence of partial feature acquisition and evaluation steps
with early-exit options. This allows for an efficient evaluation of inputs that
prevents unneeded feature acquisition. To approximate an intractable
combinatorial problem, current approaches to budgeted classification rely on
well-behaved loss functions that account for two primary objectives (processing
cost and error). These approaches offer improved efficiency over traditional
classifiers but are limited by analytic constraints in formulation and do not
manage additional performance objectives. Notably, such methods do not
explicitly account for an important aspect of real-time detection systems --
the fraction of ""accepted"" predictions satisfying a confidence criterion
imposed by a risk-averse monitor.
  We propose a problem-specific genetic algorithm to build budgeted, sequential
classifiers with confidence-based reject options. Three objectives -- accuracy,
processing time/cost, and coverage -- are considered. The algorithm emphasizes
Pareto efficiency while accounting for a notion of aggregate performance via a
unique scalarization. Experiments show our method can quickly find globally
Pareto optimal solutions in very large search spaces and is competitive with
existing approaches while offering advantages for selective, budgeted
deployment scenarios.

strongest mode with a frequency of F0 = 7.3975 $\rm{d^{-1}}$, as shown by
Fourier analysis of long cadence data (Q1-Q17, spanning 1460 days), indicating
that the target is a $\delta$ Scuti star. The other three independent modes

determine the $O-C$ through the study of phase modulation. The change of period
$(1/P)~dP/dt$ is obtained resulting in $-1.14 \times 10^{-6}~\text{yr}^{-1}$
and $-4.48 \times 10^{-6}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ for F0 and F1 respectively. Based on
frequency parameters (i.e., F0, F1, F2, and F3), a series of theoretical models
were conducted by employing the stellar evolution code MESA. The ratio of
observed $f_{1}/f_{2}$ is larger than that of the model, which may be caused by
the rotation of the star. We suggest high-resolution spectral observation is
highly desired in the future to further constrain models.

two natural semantics, a real-valued semantics and a bi-relational semantics,

temporal logic does not have any form of the finite model property for these

of an inflationary universe from a chaotic potential with a step. We
numerically evolve the perturbation equations within both cold inflation and
warm inflation. On the one hand, in a cold inflation scenario we analyse the
scalar power spectrum $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ in terms of the number of e-folds
$N_{e}$, and in terms of the ratio $k/k_{0}$, where $k_{0}$ is our pivot scale.
We show how $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ oscillates around $0.2< k/k_{0} < 20$.
Additionally, we present the evolution of two relevant parameters: the scalar
spectral index $n_\mathrm{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In fact, more
than one region of $(n_\mathrm{s},r)$ lies within the observable window (Planck
2018). On the other hand, in the warm inflationary case, we also examine the
evolution of $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ in terms of $N_{e}$ and $k/k_{0}$. Perturbations
are amplified in WI; in fact, $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ can be much larger than the CMB
value $P_{\mathcal{R}}> 2.22\times 10^{-9}$. This time, the spectral index
$n_\mathrm{s}$ is clearly blue-tilted, at smaller scales, and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ becomes too low. However, $n_\mathrm{s}$ can change
from blue-tilted towards red-tilted, since $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ starts oscillating
around $k/k_{0}\sim 40$. Indeed, the result from the step potential skims the
Planck contours. Finally, one key aspect of this research was to contrast the
features of an inflationary potential between both paradigms, and, in fact,
they show similarities and differences. Due to a featured background and a
combined effect of entropy fluctuations (only in warm inflation), in both
scenarios certain fluctuation scales are not longer ``freeze in'' on
super-horizon scales.

discovering complex control strategies for high-dimensional systems, making it
promising for flow control applications. In particular, the present work is
motivated by the goal of reducing energy dissipation in turbulent flows, and
the example considered is the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE). A major challenge associated with RL is
that substantial training data must be generated by repeatedly interacting with
the target system, making it costly when the system is computationally or
experimentally expensive. We mitigate this challenge in a data-driven manner by
combining dimensionality reduction via an autoencoder with a neural ODE
framework to obtain a low-dimensional dynamical model from just a limited data
set. We substitute this data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) in place of the
true system during RL training to efficiently estimate the optimal policy,
which can then be deployed on the true system. For the KSE actuated with
localized forcing (""jets"") at four locations, we demonstrate that we are able
to learn a ROM that accurately captures the actuated dynamics as well as the
underlying natural dynamics just from snapshots of the KSE experiencing random
actuations. Using this ROM and a control objective of minimizing dissipation
and power cost, we extract a control policy from it using deep RL. We show that
the ROM-based control strategy translates well to the true KSE and highlight
that the RL agent discovers and stabilizes an underlying forced equilibrium
solution of the KSE system. We show that this forced equilibrium captured in
the ROM and discovered through RL is related to an existing known equilibrium
solution of the natural KSE.

  We present the first unbiased, truly position-free path integral for

to do so without any bias. Additionally, our algorithm can also be used to
accelerate the rendering of BSDFs containing volumetrically scattering layers,

tight performance ratios between online and offline allocation algorithms.
Typically, tightness is established by constructing an algorithmic guarantee
and a worst-case instance separately, whose bounds match as a result of some
""ingenuity"". In this paper, we instead formulate the construction of the
worst-case instance as an optimization problem, which directly finds the tight
ratio without needing to construct two bounds separately. Our analysis of this
complex optimization problem involves identifying the structure in a new ""Type
Coverage"" dual problem. It can be seen as akin to the celebrated Magician and
OCRS problems, except more general in that it can also provide tight ratios
relative to the optimal offline allocation, whereas the earlier problems only
concerns the ex-ante relaxation of the offline problem. Through this analysis,
our paper provides a unified framework that derives new prophet inequalities
and recovers existing ones, including two important new results. First, we show
that the ""oblivious"" method of setting a static threshold due to Chawla et al.
(2020), surprisingly, is best-possible among all static threshold algorithms,
under any number $k$ of units. We emphasize that this result is derived without
needing to explicitly find any counterexample instances. Our result implies
that the asymptotic convergence rate of $1-O(\sqrt{\log k/k})$ for static
threshold algorithms, first established in Hajiaghayi et al. (2007), is tight;
this confirms for the first time a separation with the convergence rate of
adaptive algorithms, which is $1-\Theta(\sqrt{1/k})$ due to Alaei (2014).
Second, turning to the IID setting, our framework allows us to numerically
illustrate the tight guarantee (of adaptive algorithms) under any number $k$ of
starting units. Our guarantees for $k>1$ exceed the state-of-the-art.

mechanisms investigated include the fluctuating Ne diamagnetic susceptibility
due to thermal phonons, the fluctuating thermal current in normal metal

hole phase transitions based on the underlying free energy landscape. By
assuming that the transition processes between different black hole states are
stochastic, the non-Markovian dynamics of the black hole phase transition is
governed by the generalized Langevin equation with the time-dependent friction
that represents the memory effect from the effective thermal bath when the
timescale of the system is comparable or shorter than the timescale of the
effective thermal bath. We consider the first passage problem associated with
the black hole phase transitions and derive the analytical expressions of the
mean first passage time in the weak, intermediate, and large friction regimes.
As the concrete examples, we study the effects of three types of time dependent
friction kernel (delta function friction, exponentially decayed friction, and
oscillatory friction) on the dynamics of Hawking-Page phase transition and the
small/large RNAdS black hole phase transition. we found that there is a kinetic
turnover point for each type of friction kernel when the friction strength
varies. For the exponentially decayed friction kernel, it is shown that the
non-Markovian effect slows down the phase transition dynamics in the weak
friction regime and speeds up the transition process in the strong friction
regime. For the oscillating decayed friction kernel, we found kinetic
resonances when the oscillating frequency of the effective thermal bath is
equal to the oscillating frequency of the black hole state in the initial
potential well on the free energy landscape.

comments, bringing inconsistent or outdated comments. These comments increase
the cost of program understanding and greatly reduce software maintainability.
Researchers have put forward some solutions, such as CUP and HEBCUP, which
update comments efficiently for simple code changes (i.e. modifying of a single
token), but not good enough for complex ones. In this paper, we propose an
approach, named HatCUP (Hybrid Analysis and Attention based Comment UPdater),
to provide a new mechanism for comment updating task. HatCUP pays attention to
hybrid analysis and information. First, HatCUP considers the code structure
change information and introduces a structure-guided attention mechanism
combined with code change graph analysis and optimistic data flow dependency
analysis. With a generally popular RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture,
HatCUP takes the action of the code edits, the syntax, semantics and structure
code changes, and old comments as inputs and generates a structural
representation of the changes in the current code snippet. Furthermore, instead
of directly generating new comments, HatCUP proposes a new edit or non-edit
mechanism to mimic human editing behavior, by generating a sequence of edit
actions and constructing a modified RNN model to integrate newly developed
components. Evaluation on a popular dataset demonstrates that HatCUP
outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches (CUP) by 53.8%
for accuracy, 31.3% for recall and 14.3% for METEOR of the original metrics.
Compared with the heuristic-based approach (HEBCUP), HatCUP also shows better
overall performance.

diffusion in the complex plane. We then show via numerical simulation that for
normal, skew normal, and exponential distribution of objective values, the
algorithm can be used to amplify the probability of measuring the optimal
solution to a significant degree independent of the search space size. In the
case of skew normal and exponential distributions, this probability can be
amplified to be close to unity, making our algorithm near deterministic. We
then modify our algorithm in order to demonstrate how it can be extended to a

our algorithm offers a significant advantage over these classical approaches.

move with Willmore energy below $8\pi$, as the time $t$ approaches the maximal
time of existence $T_{max}(F_0)$. We prove that any singularity of a flow line

$\{\mathcal{H}^2\lfloor_{F_{t_{j_l}}}\}$, for an appropriate sequence $t_{j_l}

to a point or is homeomorphic to either a $2$-sphere or a torus in
$\mathbb{S}^3$. If the singularity $spt(\mu)$ is a torus, then it can be
parametrized by a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism, which is uniformly conformal
w.r.t. some appropriate metric of vanishing scalar curvature on $\Sigma$. If
the initial immersion of a flow line $\{F_t\}$ is assumed to parametrize a
smooth Hopf-torus in $\mathbb{S}^3$ with Willmore energy smaller than $8\pi$,

learning approach which uses optimization techniques to estimate complex

variables are identified and market changes are forecast based on
cluster-specific linear regression. Apart from the expected value of changes,
the proposed approach can also be used to obtain the distribution of possible

interpretation, as clusters of explanatory variables (or market regimes) are
identified for which the future changes follow similar relationships. Knowledge
about such clusters can provide useful insights about portfolio performance and
identify the relative importance of variables in different market regimes. An
illustrative example of predicting one-day S\&P change is considered and it is
shown that even with as few as three explanatory variables, the proposed
approach provides useful predictions.

Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx. The early time u-band light curve shows an
excess flux when compared to normal SNe Ia. We suggest that the early-excess
blue flux may be due to a rapid change in spectral velocity in the first few
days post explosion, produced by the emission of the Ca II H&K feature passing
from the u to the B bands on the time scale of a few days. This effect could be
dominant for all SNe Ia which have broad absorption features and early-time
velocities over 25,000 km/s. It is likely to be one of the main causes of
early-excess u-band flux in SNe Ia which have early-time high-velocities. This
effect may also be dominant in the UV filters, as well as in places where the
SN spectral energy distribution is quickly rising to longer wavelengths. The
rapid change in velocity can only produce a monotonic change (in flux-space) in
the u-band. For objects which explode at lower velocities, and have a more
structured shape in the early-excess emission, there must also be an additional
parameter producing the early-time diversity. More early time observations, in
particular early spectra, are required to determine how prominent this effect
is within SNe Ia.

that any product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size
at least $n^{\Omega \left( n^{1/\Delta}/\Delta\right)}$. The hard polynomial
$f$ comes from the class of Nisan-Wigderson (NW) design-based polynomials.
  Our lower bounds improve upon the recent work of Limaye, Srinivasan and
Tavenas (STOC 2022), where a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega (\Delta

set-multilinear formulas computing the iterated matrix multiplication (IMM)
polynomial of the same degree and over the same number of variables as $f$.
Moreover, our lower bounds are novel for any $\Delta\geq 2$.
  For general set-multilinear formulas, a lower bound of the form $
n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ was already obtained by Raz (J. ACM 2009) for the more
general model of multilinear formulas. The techniques of LST give a different
route to set-multilinear formula lower bounds, and allow them to obtain a lower
bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega(\log n)}$ for the size of general
set-multilinear formulas computing the IMM polynomial. Our proof techniques are
another variation on those of LST, and enable us to show an improved lower
bound (matching that of Raz) of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$, albeit for the
same polynomial $f$ in VNP (the NW polynomial). As observed by LST, if the same
$n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size lower bounds for unbounded-depth set-multilinear
formulas could be obtained for the IMM polynomial, then using the
self-reducibility of IMM and using hardness escalation results, this would

supergravity on warped deformed conifold with fluxes reveals exotic thermal
phases with nonzero expectation values of certain operators, persistent to high
temperatures. These phases, in the limit of vanishing the strong coupling scale
of the cascading gauge theory, would realize thermal ordered conformal phases
in relativistic QFTs. We find that the dual Klebanov-Strassler and
Klebanov-Tseytlin black branes in this limit are outside the regime of the
supergravity approximation, rendering the construction of such conformal

in a vision-based autonomous driving system. It involves modeling 3D dynamic
objects in complex scenes across multiple cameras. This problem is inherently
challenging due to depth estimation, visual occlusions, appearance ambiguity,
etc. Moreover, objects are not consistently associated across time and cameras.
To address that, we propose an end-to-end \textbf{MU}lti-camera
\textbf{TR}acking framework called MUTR3D. In contrast to prior works, MUTR3D
does not explicitly rely on the spatial and appearance similarity of objects.
Instead, our method introduces \textit{3D track query} to model spatial and
appearance coherent track for each object that appears in multiple cameras and
multiple frames. We use camera transformations to link 3D trackers with their
observations in 2D images. Each tracker is further refined according to the
features that are obtained from camera images. MUTR3D uses a set-to-set loss to
measure the difference between the predicted tracking results and the ground
truths. Therefore, it does not require any post-processing such as non-maximum
suppression and/or bounding box association. MUTR3D outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5.3 AMOTA on the nuScenes dataset. Code is

closely model the target behavior. Our approach is composed of two phases. In
the first, a graph neural network (GNN) is trained to extract an approximation

for a nested evolutionary algorithm called macro-micro evolution (MME). The
macro layer of this algorithm selects candidate symbolic expressions, while the
micro layer tunes its parameters. Experimental evaluation shows that our
approach outperforms competing solutions for symbolic regression, making it
possible to extract compact expressions for complex swarm behaviors.

convergence of the solution can be increased to fourth-order by solving
successively corrected finite difference systems, where the corrections are
derived from the previously computed lower order solutions. The penalty
iterations converge quickly given a good initial guess. We demonstrate the

results show that our algorithm gives fourth-order convergence for both the

PSR J0523$-$7125, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This RM is extreme
compared to other pulsars in the LMC (more than twice that of the largest
previously reported one). The average flux density of $\sim$1 mJy at 1400 MHz

representation learning to handle a known challenge in WMFC, i.e., the
sensitivity of clustering results to the point ordering along fibers. We design
a novel network architecture that represents input fibers as point clouds and
allows the incorporation of additional sources of input information from gray
matter parcellation. Thus DFC makes use of combined information about white
matter fiber geometry and gray matter anatomy to improve anatomical coherence
of fiber clusters. In addition, DFC conducts outlier removal in a natural way
by rejecting fibers with low cluster assignment probability. We evaluate DFC on
three independently acquired cohorts, including data from 220 individuals

usually small subset of cases with discordant reads is subsequently reviewed by
human experts. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of AQUARIUS, we
performed a clinical QA study on Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection in
1936 head CT scans from a large academic hospital. Immediately following image
acquisition, scans were automatically analyzed for ICH using a commercially
available software (Aidoc, Tel Aviv, Israel). Cases rated positive for ICH by

models for point clouds is how to trade-off the performance of the model and
the complexity. Existing equivariant models are either too complicate to
implement or very high complexity. The main aim of this study is to build a
general procedure to introduce group equivariant property to SOTA models for 3D
point clouds. The group equivariant models built form our procedure are simple
to implement, less complexity in comparison with the existing ones, and they
preserve the strengths of the original SOTA backbone. From the results of the

to other group equivariant models in performance and complexity. Moreover, our
method also helps to improve the mIoU of semantic segmentation models. Overall,
by using a combination of only-finite-rotation equivariance and augmentation,
our models can outperform existing full $SO(3)$-equivariance models with much

and the orbital period were detected in the TESS data between 2020 January and
March. The orbital profile systematically varied depending on the beat phase
and eclipses were missing in some phases. The eclipses in ES Dra were grazing
and the disk was probably not eclipsed in some phases depending on the
orientation of the tilted disk. These observations added a support to the
interpretation of the precessing, tilted disk as the origin of negative
superhumps. Negative superhumps disappeared 4 d before the VY Scl-type fading
started. It was likely that the mass-transfer rate quickly dropped when
negative superhumps disappeared and the decline of the total luminosity of the

the disk against a sudden decrease of the mass transfer in a VY Scl star.

identity of ES Dra as an IW And star would require further events.

fast mixing of random walks on hypergraphs has led to myriad breakthroughs
throughout theoretical computer science in the last five years, many other
important applications (e.g. locally testable codes, 2-2 games) rely on the
more general non-simplicial structures. These works make it clear that the
global expansion properties of posets depend strongly on their underlying
architecture (e.g. simplicial, cubical, linear algebraic), but the overall
phenomenon remains poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the advantage
of different architectures, highlighting how structural regularity controls the
spectral decay and edge-expansion of corresponding random walks.
  In particular, we show the spectra of walks on expanding posets (Dikstein,
Dinur, Filmus, Harsha RANDOM 2018) concentrate in strips around a small number
of approximate eigenvalues controlled by the poset's regularity. This gives a
simple condition to identify architectures (e.g. the Grassmann) that exhibit
fast (exponential) decay of eigenvalues, versus architectures like hypergraphs
with slow (linear) decay -- a crucial distinction in applications to hardness
of approximation and agreement testing such as the recent proof of the 2-2

a tight variance-based characterization of edge-expansion on eposets
generalizing (Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett (SODA 2022)), and pay special
attention to the case of the Grassmann where we show our results are tight for

excitement because of the potential speed-ups involved and the importance of
solving linear equations in many applications. However, applying these
algorithms can be challenging. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and
improvements thereof require complex subroutines suitable for fault-tolerant
hardware such as Hamiltonian simulation, making it ill-suited to current
hardware. Variational algorithms, on the other hand, involve expensive
optimization loops, which can be prone to barren plateaus and local optima. We
describe a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that
avoids these problems. Our algorithm is based on the Woodbury identity, which
analytically describes the inverse of a matrix that is a low-rank modification
of another (easily-invertible) matrix. This approach only utilizes basic
quantum subroutines like the Hadamard test or the swap test, so it is
well-suited to current hardware. There is no optimization loop, so barren
plateaus and local optima do not present a problem. The low-rank aspect of the
identity enables us to efficiently transfer information to and from the quantum
computer. This approach can produce accurate results on current hardware. As
evidence of this, we estimate an inner product involving the solution of a
system of more than 16 million equations with 2% error using IBM's Auckland
quantum computer. To our knowledge, no system of equations this large has
previously been solved to this level of accuracy on a quantum computer.

supercooled liquids with soft-repulsive potentials. Based on Brownian dynamics
simulations of supercooled charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions, our
analysis shows that the shear thinning of viscosity (eta) at large enough shear
rates (sr), expressed as eta~sr^(-lambda), originates from the evolution of the
localized elastic region (LER). An LER is a transient region composed of the
first several coordination shells of a reference particle. In response to the
external shear, particles within LER undergo nearly affine displacement before
the yielding of LER. The characteristic strain (gamma) and size (xi) of LER
respectively depend on the shear rate by gamma~sr^epsilon and xi~sr^(-nu).
Three exponents, lambda, epsilon, and nu, are related by lambda=1-epsilon=4*nu.
This simple relation connects the nonlinear rheology to the elastic properties
and the microscopic configurational distortion of the system. The relaxation of
the LER is promoted by the large-step nonaffine particle displacement along the
extensional direction of the shear geometry with the step length of 0.4
particle diameter. The elastic deformation and the relaxation of the LER are
ubiquitous and succesive in the flow, which compose the fundamental process
governing the bulk nonlinear viscoelasticity. We apply this model to analyze
the Rheo-Small Angle Neutron Scattering data of sheared charge-stabilized
colloidal suspensions. It is seen that our model well explains the neutron
spectra and the rheological data.

random walk with step-reinforcement, and is introduced by Sch\""{u}tz and
Trimper (2004). It has a parameter $\alpha \in (-1,1)$: The case $\alpha=0$
corresponds to the simple symmetric random walk, and when $\alpha>0$ (resp.
$\alpha<0$), the mean displacement of the walker at time $n$ grows (resp.
vanishes) like $n^{\alpha}$. The walk admits a phase transition at $\alpha=1/2$
from the diffusive behavior to the superdiffusive behavior. In this paper, we
study the rate of the moment convergence in the central limit theorem for the
position of the walker when $-1 < \alpha \leq 1/2$. We find a crossover
phenomenon in the rate of convergence of the $2m$-th moments with
$m=2,3,\ldots$ inside the diffusive regime $-1<\alpha<1/2$.

antiferromagnetic chains with integer $S$ and half-odd-integer $S$ discovered

intuitive diagrammatic explanation of the qualitative difference between chains

symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases.
  More precisely, we define one-parameter families of states, which we call the
asymmetric valence-bond solid (VBS) states, that continuously interpolate
between the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state and the trivial zero state
in quantum spin chains with $S=1$ and 2. The asymmetric VBS state is obtained
by systematically modifying the AKLT state. It always has exponentially
decaying truncated correlation functions and is a unique gapped ground state of
a short-ranged Hamiltonian. We also observe that the asymmetric VBS state
possesses the time-reversal, the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the
bond-centered inversion symmetries for $S=2$, but not for $S=1$. This is
consistent with the known fact that the AKLT model belongs to the trivial SPT
phase if $S=2$ and to a nontrivial SPT phase if $S=1$. Although such
interpolating families of disordered states were already known, our
construction is unified and is based on a simple physical picture. It also
extends to spin chains with general integer $S$ and provides us with an

  Reconstruction",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We revisit the classical problem of band-limited signal reconstruction -- a
variant of the \emph{Set Query} problem -- which asks to efficiently
reconstruct (a subset of) a $d$-dimensional Fourier-sparse signal
($\|\widehat{x}(t)\|_0 \leq k$), from minimum \emph{noisy} samples of $x(t)$ in
the time domain. We present a unified framework for this problem, by developing
a theory of sparse Fourier transforms over \emph{lattices}, which can be viewed
as a ``semi-continuous'' version of SFT, in-between discrete and continuous
domains. Using this framework, we obtain the following results:
  $\bullet$ *High-dimensional Fourier sparse recovery* We present a
sample-optimal discrete Fourier Set-Query algorithm with $O(k^{\omega+1})$
reconstruction time in one dimension, \emph{independent} of the signal's length
($n$) and $\ell_\infty$-norm ($R^* \approx \|\widehat{x}\|_\infty$). This
complements the state-of-art algorithm of [Kapralov, STOC 2017], whose
reconstruction time is $\tilde{O}(k \log^2 n \log R^*)$, and is limited to
low-dimensions. By contrast, our algorithm works for arbitrary $d$ dimensions,
mitigating the $\exp(d)$ blowup in decoding time to merely linear in $d$. Our
algorithm also works for the semi-continuous case where frequencies lie on a
lattice.
  $\bullet$ *High-accuracy Fourier interpolation* We design a polynomial-time
$(1+ \sqrt{2} +\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for continuous Fourier
interpolation. This bypasses a barrier of all previous algorithms [Price and
Song, FOCS 2015, Chen, Kane, Price and Song, FOCS 2016] which only achieve
$c>100$ approximation for this basic problem. Our algorithm relies on several

fully optimized with label smoothing, translation length is implicitly upper
bounded by a fixed constant independent of input. We verify our theory by
applying a simple rectification function at inference time to restore the

such as spam detection, malware detection, or network intrusion detection, are
built on supervised machine learning algorithms. In such a paradigm, models
need a large amount of labeled data to learn the useful relationships between
selected features and the target class. However, such labeled data can be
scarce and expensive to acquire. Goal: To help security practitioners train
useful security classification models when few labeled training data and many
unlabeled training data are available. Method: We propose an adaptive framework
called Dapper, which optimizes 1) semi-supervised learning algorithms to assign
pseudo-labels to unlabeled data in a propagation paradigm and 2) the machine
learning classifier (i.e., random forest). When the dataset class is highly
imbalanced, Dapper then adaptively integrates and optimizes a data oversampling
method called SMOTE. We use the novel Bayesian Optimization to search a large
hyperparameter space of these tuning targets. Result: We evaluate Dapper with
three security datasets, i.e., the Twitter spam dataset, the malware URLs
dataset, and the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. Experimental results indicate that we
can use as low as 10% of original labeled data but achieve close or even better
classification performance than using 100% labeled data in a supervised way.
Conclusion: Based on those results, we would recommend using hyperparameter
optimization with semi-supervised learning when dealing with shortages of
labeled security data.

However, environments with tight resource constraints, changing objectives and
intentions, or varied task requirements, could limit the real-world utility of
a singular JAT. Hence, in tandem with current trends towards building
increasingly large JATs, this paper conducts an initial exploration into
concepts underlying the creation of a diverse set of compact machine learning
model sets. Composed of many smaller and specialized models, we formulate the
Set of Sets to simultaneously fulfil many task settings and environmental
conditions. A means to arrive at such a set tractably in one pass of a
neuroevolutionary multitasking algorithm is presented for the first time,
bringing us closer to models that are collectively 'Masters of All Trades'.

binary agreement, state machine replication, or blockchain consensus, require
all protocol participants in a peer-to-peer system to agree on exactly the same

is extensively studied, and is useful for most consensus based decentralized
applications, it falls short of defining correct distributed systems which
mandate participant credential based privileged visibility into the consensus
payload, through the consensus protocol itself. We introduce a new paradigm for
distributed consensus, called functional blockchain consensus. Functional
blockchain consensus allows each blockchain protocol participant to agree on
some distinct sub-information of the list of transactions, as a function of the
credentials of the participant in the blockchain system, instead of agreeing on
the entire list of transactions. We motivate two adversary models, one with a
standard crash-fault adversary and another with a novel rational-fault
adversary, to compromise functional blockchain consensus. We then present two
versions of a blockchain protocol called SightSteeple, that achieves functional
blockchain consensus in the said fault models. SightSteeple relies on a novel
combination of standard blockchain consensus and functional encryption, among
other primitives, to achieve its goals of correctness. Finally, we discuss
practical uses of functional blockchain consensus based asymmetric distributed
ledgers, and motivate off-shoot constructions that can result from this new

occurred throughout history. During the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic there has
been much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on
behavior. Under such circumstances policymakers must balance a complex spectrum
of objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health
services might be 'overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration yet formal
modelling of optimal policy has so far largely ignored this. Here we show how
costly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to
exactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even
when these are not aligned. We assume that choices made by individuals give
rise to Nash equilibrium behavior. We focus on a situation in which the
capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify
conditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. In
particular we find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections as the maximum
infection cost in the government's objective function is increased. This is in
marked contrast to the gradual reduction without government intervention. The
infection costs at which this switch occurs depend on how costly the
intervention is to the government. We find optimal interventions that are quite
different to the case when interventions are cost-free. Finally, we identify a
novel analytic solution for the Nash equilibrium behavior for constant
infection cost.

a $\Lambda$ formed by two Raman transitions between the ground hyperfine levels

dark state. Using state-dependent difference in vibration frequency of the atom
in a circularly polarized trap, we can tune the $\Lambda$ to make only the

coherent population trapping (MSCPT). We write the master equations for RSC and
MSCPT and solve them numerically for a $^{87}$Rb atom in a one-dimensional

steady state slowly compared with RSC, the former consistently produces colder
atoms than the latter. The numerical results also show that subrecoil cooling

experimentally feasible, condition. We explain this performance quantitatively

involvement in classifier learning. Also, NPC is applicable to any classifier
trained with noisy label methods, if training instances and its predictions are

next-generation mobile system needs to exploit the abundant spectrum in the
millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. However, high-frequency transmission
heavily relies on large-scale antenna arrays to reap high beamforming gain,
used to compensate for severe propagation loss. It raises a problem of
omni-directional beamforming during the phase of initial access, where a base
station is required to broadcast synchronization signals and system information
to all users within its coverage. This paper proposes a novel initial
beamforming scheme, which provides instantaneous gain equally in all directions
by forming a pair of complementary beams. Numerical results verify that it can
achieve omni-directional coverage with the optimal performance that remarkably
outperforms the previous scheme called random beamforming. It is applicable for
any form of large-scale arrays, and all three architecture, i.e., digital,

that our method can detect the actions of the match, identify which of these

hardening, high tensile strength, and high ductility, which make them
attractive for structural applications. At low tensile strain rates, TWIP
steels are prone to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Here though, we study the
hardening and strengthening resulting from electrochemical hydrogen-charging of
a surface layer of a Fe-26.9Mn-0.28C (wt.%) TWIP steel. We observed a 20%
increase in yield strength following the electrochemical hydrogen-charging,
accompanied by a reduction in ductility from 75% to 10% at a tensile strain
rate of 10-3s-1. The microstructural evolution during tensile deformation was
examined at strain levels of 3%, 5% and 7% by electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) to study the dislocation
structure of the hardened region. As expected, the microstructure of the
hydrogen-hardened and the uncharged regions of the material evolve differently.
The uncharged areas show entangled dislocation structures, indicating slip from
a limited number of potentially coplanar slip systems. In contrast, hydrogen
segregated to the grain boundaries, revealed by the deuterium-labelled atom
probe tomography, delays the dislocation nucleation by blocking dislocation
sources at the grain boundaries. The charged areas hence first show the
formation of cells, indicating dislocation entanglement from more non-coplanar
slip systems. With increasing strain, these cells dissolve, and stacking faults
and strain-induced {\epsilon}-martensite are formed, promoted by the presence
of hydrogen. The influence of hydrogen on dislocation structures and the
overall deformation mechanism is discussed in details.

between regions of different filling factors, and study spin-dependent
tunneling across the edge modes at the interfaces. Here we report on tunnel
transport through a $\nu=0$ region in a graphite-gated, hexagonal boron nitride
($hBN$) encapsulated monolayer graphene device, with the $\nu=0$ strip
sandwiched by spin-polarized $\nu=\pm1$ quantum Hall states. We observe finite
tunneling ($t \sim 0.3-0.6$) between the $\nu=\pm1$ edges at not too small
magnetic fields ($B>3T$) and low tunnel bias voltage ($<30-60\mu V$), which is
surprising because electrons at the edge states nominally have opposite spins.
Hartree-Fock calculations elucidate these phenomena as being driven by the
formation of a CAF order parameter in the $\nu=0$ region at zero bias (for wide
enough junctions) leading to non-orthogonal spins at the edges. Remarkably,
this tunneling can be controllably switched off by increasing bias; bias
voltage leads to a pileup of charge at the junction, leading to a collapse of
the CAF order and a suppression of the tunneling.

  Collaborative Edge Computing","Submitted to Wiopt 2022",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Collaborative edge computing (CEC) is an emerging paradigm where
heterogeneous edge devices (stakeholders) collaborate to fulfill computation
tasks, such as model training or video processing, by sharing communication and
computation resources. Nevertheless, the optimal data/result routing and
computation offloading strategy in CEC with arbitrary topology still remains an
open problem. In this paper, we formulate a partial-offloading and multi-hop
routing model for arbitrarily divisible tasks. Each node individually decides
the computation of the received data and the forwarding of data/result traffic.
In contrast to most existing works, our model applies to tasks with
non-negligible result size, and enables separable data sources and result
destinations. We propose a network-wide cost minimization problem with
congestion-aware cost to jointly optimize routing and computation offloading.
This problem covers various performance metrics and constraints, such as
average queueing delay with limited processor capacity. Although the problem is
non-convex, we provide non-trivial necessary and sufficient conditions for the
global-optimal solution, and devise a fully distributed algorithm that
converges to the optimum in polynomial time, allows asynchronous individual
updating, and is adaptive to changes in network topology or task pattern.
Numerical evaluation shows that our proposed method significantly outperforms
other baseline algorithms in multiple network instances, especially in
congested scenarios.

are locally allowed. To run a quantum circuit under those constraints, qubits
need to be mapped to different quantum registers, and multi-qubit gates need to
be routed accordingly. Recent developments have shown that compiling strategies
based on Steiner tree provide a competitive tool to route CNOTs. However, these
algorithms require the qubit map to be decided before routing. Moreover, the
qubit map is fixed throughout the computation, i.e. the logical qubit will not
be moved to a different physical qubit register. This is inefficient with
respect to the CNOT count of the resulting circuit. In this paper, we propose
the algorithm PermRowCol for routing CNOTs in a quantum circuit. It dynamically
remaps logical qubits during the computation, and thus results in fewer output
CNOTs than the algorithms Steiner-Gauss and RowCol. Here we focus on circuits
over CNOT only, but this method could be generalized to a routing and mapping
strategy on Clifford+T circuits by slicing the quantum circuit into subcircuits
composed of CNOTs and single-qubit gates. Additionally, PermRowCol can be used
in place of Steiner-Gauss in the synthesis of phase polynomials as well as the
extraction of quantum circuits from ZX-diagrams.

cascade induced by the neutrino interaction produces coherent radio emission
that can be picked up by antennas. As the near-surface ice properties change
rapidly within the upper $\mathcal{O}$(100m), a good understanding of the ice
properties is required to reconstruct the neutrino properties. In particular,
continuous monitoring of the snow accumulation (which changes the depth of the
antennas) and the index-of-refraction $n(z)$ profile are crucial for an
accurate determination of the neutrino's direction and energy. We present an
in-situ calibration system that extends the radio detector station with two
radio emitters to continuously monitor the firn properties within the upper 40m
by measuring the time differences between direct and reflected (off the
surface) signals (D'n'R). We determine the optimal positions of two
transmitters at all three sites of current and future in-ice radio detectors:
Greenland, Moore's Bay, and the South Pole. For the South Pole we find that the
snow accumulation $\Delta h$ can be measured with a resolution of 3mm and the
parameters of an exponential $n(z)$ profile $\alpha$ and $z_0$ with 0.04% and
0.14% precision respectively, which constitutes an improvement of more than a
factor of 10 as compared to the inference of the $n(z)$ profile from density
measurements. Additionally, as this technique is based on the measurement of
the signal propagation times we are not bound to the conversion of density to
index-of-refraction. We quantify the impact of these ice uncertainties on the

the potential of model for text understanding. To further equip the machine
with the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is
proposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to
extract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains
a challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.
Also, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further
fuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above
issues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch
graph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce
different extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical
units, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The
logical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the
syntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.
Secondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each
graph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two
adjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer
layers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text
embedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware
self-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the
features. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the
logical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental
results show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks.

weak-to-strong measurement transition for Fock-state-based pointer pointer
states, and analyze in some details the case of coherent pointer states. A

nanoscale spin valve elements of different sizes, shapes and arrays is of vital
importance for their application in future magnetic memory and storage devices.
To this end, we have inspected the magnetic switching mechanism and
magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale spin valve (Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20) elements of
two different shapes with varying lateral aspect ratios (ARs) by computational
micromagnetic simulation. Further, we have inspected the same for 2x2 and 3x3
arrays of the elliptical elements with AR = 1.25 of varying interelement
spacing. We have analysed how the shape of the hysteresis loop and its various
parameters such as the coercive field, remanence, saturation field were altered
by the variation in magnetic field. The magnetization reversal states were
simulated to explore the spatial coherence of magnetization switching. We
observe that the elements with higher AR show the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers
forming antiparallel states in the plateau similar to synthetic
antiferromagnets. As we reduce the AR, more complex quasi-uniform magnetic
states are observed which are even more complicated for elliptical elements.
The elliptical elements with the aspect ratio of 1.25 shows coherent and
predictable switching behaviour, showing its suitability for the application in
magnetic memory elements. We observe a gradual increase in magnetoresistance
(MR%) with the increase in AR of the spin valve elements, and the decrease in
interelement spacing between the spin valve elements in their arrays. The
magnetic flux density decreases, as we increase the cell spacing between the
elements. The magnetic hysteresis loops, magnetoresistance and spatial
coherence of magnetic switching give a guiding principle for selection of
geometric parameters of nanoscale spin valve arrays towards their application
in magnetic memory devices.

widely explored for single-layer graphs, the problem for multilayer graphs has
just recently attracted attention. Existing community models in multilayer
graphs have several limitations, including disconnectivity, free-rider effect,
resolution limits, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we study the
problem of community search over large multilayer graphs. We first introduce
FirmTruss, a novel dense structure in multilayer networks, which extends the
notion of truss to multilayer graphs. We show that FirmTrusses possess nice
structural and computational properties and bring many advantages compared to
the existing models. Building on this, we present a new community model based
on FirmTruss, called FTCS, and show that finding an FTCS community is NP-hard.
We propose two efficient 2-approximation algorithms, and show that no
polynomial-time algorithm can have a better approximation guarantee unless P =
NP. We propose an index-based method to further improve the efficiency of the
algorithms. We then consider attributed multilayer networks and propose a new
community model based on network homophily. We show that community search in
attributed multilayer graphs is NP-hard and present an effective and efficient
approximation algorithm. Experimental studies on real-world graphs with
ground-truth communities validate the quality of the solutions we obtain and
the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

This study introduces a new machine-learning based framework relying on
satellite observations to improve understanding of the representation of clouds
and their relevant processes in climate models. The proposed method is capable
of assigning distributions of established cloud types to coarse data. It
facilitates a more objective evaluation of clouds in ESMs and improves the
consistency of cloud process analysis. The method is built on satellite data
from the MODIS instrument labelled by deep neural networks with cloud types
defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), using cloud type labels
from CloudSat as ground truth. The method is applicable to datasets with
information about physical cloud variables comparable to MODIS satellite data
and at sufficiently high temporal resolution. We apply the method to
alternative satellite data from the Cloud\_cci project (ESA Climate Change
Initiative), coarse-grained to typical resolutions of climate models. The
resulting cloud type distributions are physically consistent and the horizontal
resolutions typical of ESMs are sufficient to apply our method. We recommend
outputting crucial variables required by our method for future ESM data
evaluation. This will enable the use of labelled satellite data for a more
systematic evaluation of clouds in climate models.

Internet. Although the original standard defined the usage of DNS over UDP
(DoUDP) as well as DNS over TCP (DoTCP), UDP has become the predominant
protocol used in the DNS. With the introduction of new Resource Records (RRs),
the sizes of DNS responses have increased considerably. Since this can lead to
truncation or IP fragmentation, the fallback to DoTCP as required by the
standard ensures successful DNS responses by overcoming the size limitations of
DoUDP. However, the effects of the usage of DoTCP by stub resolvers are not
extensively studied to this date. We close this gap by presenting a view at
DoTCP from the Edge, issuing 12.1M DNS requests from 2,500 probes toward Public
as well as Probe DNS recursive resolvers. In our measurement study, we observe
that DoTCP is generally slower than DoUDP, where the relative increase in
Response Time is less than 37% for most resolvers. While optimizations to DoTCP
can be leveraged to further reduce the response times, we show that support on
Public resolvers is still missing, hence leaving room for optimizations in the
future. Moreover, we also find that Public resolvers generally have comparable
reliability for DoTCP and DoUDP. However, Probe resolvers show a significantly
different behavior: DoTCP queries targeting Probe resolvers fail in 3 out of 4
cases, and, therefore, do not comply with the standard. This problem will only
aggravate in the future: As DNS response sizes will continue to grow, the need
for DoTCP will solidify.

the methods focus on single persons, which estimate the poses in the
person-centric coordinates, i.e., the coordinates based on the center of the
target person. Hence, these methods are inapplicable for multi-person 3D pose
estimation, where the absolute coordinates (e.g., the camera coordinates) are
required. Moreover, multi-person pose estimation is more challenging than
single pose estimation, due to inter-person occlusion and close human
interactions. Existing top-down multi-person methods rely on human detection
(i.e., top-down approach), and thus suffer from the detection errors and cannot
produce reliable pose estimation in multi-person scenes. Meanwhile, existing
bottom-up methods that do not use human detection are not affected by detection
errors, but since they process all persons in a scene at once, they are prone
to errors, particularly for persons in small scales. To address all these
challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to
exploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all
persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible
erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection
based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling
scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and
bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3D poses. To
address the common gaps between training and testing data, we do optimization
during the test time, by refining the estimated 3D human poses using high-order
temporal constraint, re-projection loss, and bone length regularizations. Our
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code and

types of features are mutually correlated. In this paper, we propose a guided
residuals network, namely GRnet, which fuses spatial-domain and residual-domain
features in a mutually reinforcing way, to expose face images generated by
Deepfake. Different from existing prediction based residual extraction methods,
we propose a manipulation trace extractor (MTE) to directly remove the content
features and preserve manipulation traces. MTE is a fine-grained method that
can avoid the potential bias caused by inappropriate prediction. Moreover, an
attention fusion mechanism (AFM) is designed to selectively emphasize feature
channel maps and adaptively allocate the weights for two streams. The
experimental results show that the proposed GRnet achieves better performances
than the state-of-the-art works on four public fake face datasets including
HFF, FaceForensics++, DFDC and Celeb-DF. Especially, GRnet achieves an average
accuracy of 97.72% on the HFF dataset, which is at least 5.25% higher than the
existing works.

hypothesized that humans will exhibit more social responses when interacting
with conversational agent that has a synthetic voice built on spontaneous
speech. Typically, speech synthesizers are built on a speech corpus where voice
professionals read a set of written sentences. The synthesized speech is clear
as if a newscaster were reading a news or a voice actor were playing an anime
character. However, this is quite different from spontaneous speech we speak in
everyday conversation. Recent advances in speech synthesis enabled us to build
a speech synthesizer on a spontaneous speech corpus, and to obtain a near
conversational synthesized speech with reasonable quality. By making use of
these technology, we examined whether humans produce more social responses to a
spontaneously speaking conversational agent. We conducted a large-scale
conversation experiment with a conversational agent whose utterances were
synthesized with the model trained either with spontaneous speech or read
speech. The result showed that the subjects who interacted with the agent whose
utterances were synthesized from spontaneous speech tended to show shorter
response time and a larger number of backchannels. The result of a
questionnaire showed that subjects who interacted with the agent whose
utterances were synthesized from spontaneous speech tended to rate their
conversation with the agent as closer to a human conversation. These results
suggest that speech synthesis built on spontaneous speech is essential to
realize a conversational agent as a social actor.

flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)_{\chi}$ gauge group, constructed within the framework
of F-theory. Its origin is traced back to the $SO(10)$ symmetry -- associated
with a geometric singularity of the compactification manifold -- broken by an
internal flux which is turned on along the seven-brane in the $U(1)_{\chi}$
direction. Topological properties and the choice of flux parameters determine
the massless spectrum of the model to be that of the minimal flipped $SU(5)$
supplemented with an extra right-handed electron-type state and its complex
conjugate, $E^c+\bar E^c$, as well as neutral singlet fields. The subsequent
symmetry breaking to the $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)_Y$ gauge group occurs
with a Higgs pair in $10+\overline{10}$ representations of $SU(5)$. Next we
proceed to the phenomenological analysis of the resulting effective model and
the salient outcomes are: The $E^c+\bar E^c$ pair acquires a mass of few TeV
and as such could solve the $g_{\mu}-2$ discrepancy. Neutrino couplings to
extra neutral singlets lead to an inverse seesaw mechanism where an extra light
state could be a suitable dark matter candidate. The predictions of the model
for the ${0\nu}\beta\beta$ decay rate could be tested in near future
experiments. There are non-unitarity deviations from lepton mixing matrix
($U_{PMNS}$), which could in principle explain the new precision measurement of

Knowledge Enhanced Conversation graph (KEC). KEC propagates the CSK between two

be comparatively mild, on the one hand, while possessing inherent practical

Based on recent developments, the theory in this paper enriches asymptotic
constraint qualifications for very general nonsmooth optimization problems over
inverse images of set-valued mappings by incorporating directional data. We
compare these new directional asymptotic regularity conditions with standard
constraint qualifications from nonsmooth optimization. Further, we introduce
directional concepts of pseudo- and quasi-normality which apply to set-valued
mappings. It is shown that these properties provide sufficient conditions for

communications (LLC - below 10 ms), due to the lossy behaviour of mmWave
channel and the lower-layers' retransmission mechanisms. On the other hand,
fixed sliding window random linear network coding (RLNC) is able to achieve
LLC, and even better, adaptive sliding window RLNC obtains ultra-reliable LLC

below 10 ms with more than 99% success rate).

factorization. For this purpose, we use an alternative joint entropy measure
based on the log-determinant of covariance, which we refer to as
log-determinant (LD) entropy. The corresponding (LD) mutual information between
two vectors reflects a level of their correlation. We pose the infomax BSS
criterion as the maximization of the LD-mutual information between the input

a presumed domain set. In contrast to the ICA infomax approach, the proposed
information maximization approach can separate both dependent and independent

separation condition in the noiseless case.

consumption, transmission delays, and bit error rate in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
UAV networks. A UAV is fitted with a wireless Bidirectional Relay BR to enable
coverage network extension and increase transmission throughput. The downside
of the BR advantages is the delay in data transmission caused by the UAV
movement. A consequence of this delay is increased total energy consumption,
causing further degradation in bit error rate performance, especially at high
SNR levels. In wireless communication, the trade-off between delay and energy
consumption is, fortunately, possible to improve performance. Therefore, this
study aims to enhance UAV network performance by reducing energy consumption,
data transmission delay, and bit error rate. A multi-objective algorithm is
employed to generate an adaptive optimal energy allocation strategy based on
the balance between energy consumption and transmission delays. The results of
theoretical analysis are illustrated with several examples. As herein
demonstrated, the proposed solution effectively balances delay and energy
efficiency in a customised system design and improves the bit error rate in UAV

Former studies, such as the top trading cycle, examined how to conduct fair
joint decision-making while avoiding decision conflicts from the perspective of
game theory when multiple players have their own deterministic preference
profiles. However, in reality, probabilistic preferences can naturally appear
in relation to the stochastic decision-making of humans. Here, we theoretically
derive conflict-free joint decision-making that can satisfy the probabilistic
preferences of all individual players. More specifically, we mathematically
prove the conditions wherein the deviation of the resultant chance of obtaining
each choice from the individual preference profile, which we call the loss,
becomes zero, meaning that all players' satisfaction is perfectly appreciated
while avoiding decision conflicts. Furthermore, even in situations where
zero-loss conflict-free joint decision-making is unachievable, we show how to

and/or semantic corpus lacks the necessary criteria to be considered creative.
Among several issues identified in the literature, we focus on the fact that
generative adversarial networks (GANs) that create a single image, in a vacuum,
lack a concept of novelty regarding how their product differs from previously
created ones. We envision that an algorithm that combines the novelty
preservation mechanisms in evolutionary algorithms with the power of GANs can
deliberately guide its creative process towards output that is both good and
novel. In this paper, we use recent advances in image generation based on
semantic prompts using OpenAI's CLIP model, interrupting the GAN's iterative
process with short cycles of evolutionary divergent search. The results of
evolution are then used to continue the GAN's iterative process; we hypothesise
that this intervention will lead to more novel outputs. Testing our hypothesis
using novelty search with local competition, a quality-diversity evolutionary
algorithm that can increase visual diversity while maintaining quality in the
form of adherence to the semantic prompt, we explore how different notions of
visual diversity can affect both the process and the product of the algorithm.
Results show that even a simplistic measure of visual diversity can help
counter a drift towards similar images caused by the GAN. This first experiment
opens a new direction for introducing higher intentionality and a more nuanced
drive for GANs.

popular topic due to the recent advances of inertial dynamics with damping in
convex optimization. Mathematically, the ground state of a rotating
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can be modeled as a minimizer of the
Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional with angular momentum rotational term under
the normalization constraint. We introduce two types of second-order flows as
energy minimization strategies for this constrained non-convex optimization
problem, in order to approach the ground state. The proposed artificial
dynamics are novel second-order nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential
equations with dissipation. Several numerical discretization schemes are
discussed, including explicit and semi-implicit methods for temporal
discretization, combined with a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial
discretization. These provide us a series of efficient and robust algorithms
for computing the ground states of rotating BECs. Particularly, the newly
developed algorithms turn out to be superior to the state-of-the-art numerical
methods based on the gradient flow. In comparison with the gradient flow type
approaches: When explicit temporal discretization strategies are adopted, the
proposed methods allow for larger stable time step sizes; While for
semi-implicit discretization, using the same step size, a much smaller number
of iterations are needed for the proposed methods to reach the stopping
criterion, and every time step encounters almost the same computational
complexity. Rich and detailed numerical examples are documented for

biographical knowledge graphs. RE is usually framed as a supervised machine
learning (ML) problem, where ML models are trained on annotated datasets.
However, there are few annotated datasets for RE since the annotation process
can be costly and time-consuming. To address this, we developed Biographical,
the first semi-supervised dataset for RE. The dataset, which is aimed towards
digital humanities (DH) and historical research, is automatically compiled by
aligning sentences from Wikipedia articles with matching structured data from
sources including Pantheon and Wikidata. By exploiting the structure of
Wikipedia articles and robust named entity recognition (NER), we match
information with relatively high precision in order to compile annotated
relation pairs for ten different relations that are important in the DH domain.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset by training a
state-of-the-art neural model to classify relation pairs, and evaluate it on a
manually annotated gold standard set. Biographical is primarily aimed at
training neural models for RE within the domain of digital humanities and

were found. However, using spectral data from simulated ablation of different
meteorite types, we show that H emission from asteroidal materials can occur,
and apparently correlates with their water and organic matter content.
Strongest H emission was detected from carbonaceous chondrites (CM and CV) and
achondrites (ureilite and aubrite), while it was lacking in most ordinary
chondrites. The detection of H$\alpha$ in asteroidal meteoroids could be used
to identify meteoroids of carbonaceous or achondritic composition. Overall, our

population of random walks where the diffusion coefficient is not constant, but
behaves as a power-law of the average resetting rate of the population.
Resetting occurs only beyond a threshold distance from the origin. This problem
is motivated by physical realizations like soft matter under shear, where
diffusion of a walk is induced by resetting events of other walks. We first
reformulate in the broader context of diffusion with stochastic resetting the
so-called H\'ebraud-Lequeux model for plasticity in dense soft matter, in which
diffusivity is proportional to the average resetting rate. Depending on
parameter values, the response to a weak external field may be either linear or
non-linear with a non-zero average position for a vanishing applied field, and
the transition between these two regimes may be interpreted as a continuous
phase transition. Extending the model by considering a general power-law
relation between diffusivity and average resetting rate, we notably find a
discontinuous phase transition between a finite diffusivity and a vanishing
diffusivity in the small field limit.

a rational component, i.e., they have a good education, they speak clearly.
Second, an affective component, based on observables such as visual features of
race and gender, and possibly biased by stereotypes. Here we propose a method
for measuring the affective, socially biased, component, thus enabling its
removal. That is, given a decision-making process, these affective measurements
remove the affective bias in the decision, rendering it fair across a set of
categories defined by the method itself. We thus propose that this may solve
three key problems in intersectional fairness: (1) the definition of categories
over which fairness is a consideration; (2) an infinite regress into smaller
and smaller groups; and (3) ensuring a fair distribution based on basic human
rights or other prior information. The primary idea in this paper is that
fairness biases can be measured using affective coherence, and that this can be
used to normalize outcome mappings. We aim for this conceptual work to expose a
novel method for handling fairness problems that uses emotional coherence as an
independent measure of bias that goes beyond statistical parity.

transformer of CLIP, the essential visual tokenization process, which produces
discrete visual token sequences, generates many homogeneous tokens due to the
redundancy nature of consecutive and similar frames in videos. This
significantly increases computation costs and hinders the deployment of video
retrieval models in web applications. In this paper, to reduce the number of
redundant video tokens, we design a multi-segment token clustering algorithm to
find the most representative tokens and drop the non-essential ones. As the
frame redundancy occurs mostly in consecutive frames, we divide videos into
multiple segments and conduct segment-level clustering. Center tokens from each
segment are later concatenated into a new sequence, while their original
spatial-temporal relations are well maintained. We instantiate two clustering
algorithms to efficiently find deterministic medoids and iteratively partition
groups in high dimensional space. Through this token clustering and center
selection procedure, we successfully reduce computation costs by removing
redundant visual tokens. This method further enhances segment-level semantic
alignment between video and text representations, enforcing the spatio-temporal
interactions of tokens from within-segment frames. Our method, coined as
CenterCLIP, surpasses existing state-of-the-art by a large margin on typical

  Gradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform
optimization and by far the most common way to optimize machine learning tasks.
Its stochastic version receives attention in recent years, and this is
particularly true for optimizing deep neural networks. In deep neural networks,
the gradient followed by a single sample or a batch of samples is employed to
save computational resources and escape from saddle points. In 1951, Robbins
and Monro published \textit{A stochastic approximation method}, one of the
first modern treatments on stochastic optimization that estimates local
gradients with a new batch of samples. And now, stochastic optimization has
become a core technology in machine learning, largely due to the development of
the back propagation algorithm in fitting a neural network. The sole aim of
this article is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and
mathematical tools in gradient descent and stochastic optimization.

Namely, without the gauge fields, the lattice fermions show superconducting

was proved by the present author. This paper is the continuing part of the
previous one. More precisely, the interactions between fermions were assumed to
be a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type pairing which is a nearest-neighbour
two-body interaction on the hypercubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with the
dimension $d\ge 3$. In the present paper, we deal with the corresponding gauged
model by introducing classical U(1) gauge fields. We prove that a certain
configuration of gauge fields which yields the $\pi$ flux for all the
plaquettes in the lattice minimizes the ground-state energy of the fermion
system. Since this configuration of the gauge fields exactly coincides with the
hopping amplitudes of the Hamiltonian of the previous paper, the ground state
of the whole system shows superconducting long-range order. Any configuration
of gauge fields which is gauge-equivalent to this special configuration of the
gauge fields also yields another ground state. However, if the Cooper pair
correlations are averaged over the gauge-equivalent class, then they are
vanishing except for the on-site correlation because the Cooper pair
correlations are not necessarily gauge invariant. On the other hand, the string
Cooper pair correlations which are gauge invariant always show the same
long-range order for any configuration of gauge fields in the gauge-equivalent
class.

the existing work, each point in the cloud may inevitably be selected as the
neighbors of multiple aggregation centers, as all centers will gather neighbor
features from the whole point cloud independently. Thus each point has to
participate in the calculation repeatedly and generates redundant duplicates in
the memory, leading to intensive computation costs and memory consumption.
Meanwhile, to pursue higher accuracy, previous methods often rely on a complex
local aggregator to extract fine geometric representation, which further slows
down the classification pipeline. To address these issues, we propose a new
local aggregator of linear complexity for point cloud classification, coined as
APP. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary container as an anchor to exchange
features between the source point and the aggregating center. Each source point
pushes its feature to only one auxiliary container, and each center point pulls
features from only one auxiliary container. This avoids the re-computation
issue of each source point. To facilitate the learning of the local structure
of cloud point, we use an online normal estimation module to provide the
explainable geometric information to enhance our APP modeling capability. Our
built network is more efficient than all the previous baselines with a clear
margin while still consuming a lower memory. Experiments on both synthetic and

distribution, i.e., a set of edges that are pairwise disjoint. It is known
that, if $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth, then
$\textrm{PrMatching}(\mathcal{G})$ can be solved in polynomial time. In this
paper we show that, under some assumptions, bounded treewidth in fact
characterizes the tractable graph families for this problem. More precisely, we
show intractability for all graph families $\mathcal{G}$ satisfying the
following treewidth-constructibility requirement: given an integer $k$ in
unary, we can construct in polynomial time a graph $G \in \mathcal{G}$ with
treewidth at least $k$. Our hardness result is then the following: for any
treewidth-constructible graph family $\mathcal{G}$, the problem
$\textrm{PrMatching}(\mathcal{G})$ is intractable. This generalizes known
hardness results for weighted matching counting under some restrictions that do
not bound treewidth, e.g., being planar, 3-regular, or bipartite; it also
answers a question left open in Amarilli, Bourhis and Senellart (PODS'16). We
also obtain a similar lower bound for the weighted counting of edge covers.

sampling of alternatives, but the usage of that result in Crawford et al.

be attained if any subset of the true consideration set is used for estimation,
but McFadden (1978) shows that, in general, one needs to do a sampling
correction that depends on the protocol used to draw the choice set. This note
derives the sampling correction that is required when the choice set for

which such correction would fulfill the uniform condition property and can
therefore be ignored when building practical estimators, such as the ones
analyzed by Crawford et al. (2021).

studied in situ in an electron microscope under controlled low-pressure oxygen
environments at room temperature.Oxidation is the main cause of degradation of
many two-dimensional materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides,
under ambient conditions. MoTe$_2$ is found to be reactive to oxygen, leading
to significant degradation above a pressure of 1$\times 10^{-7}$ torr.
Curiously, the common hydrocarbon contamination found on practically all

In contrast to MoTe$_2$, MoS$_2$ is found to be inert under oxygen environment,
with all observed structural changes being caused by electron irradiation only,
leading to well-defined pores with high proportion of molybdenum
nanowire-terminated edges. Using density functional theory calculations, a
further atomic-scale mechanism leading to the observed oxygen-related

standard probe of cosmology. It is caused by the scattering of photons from the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the hot cluster electron gas. In a similar
manner, other photon backgrounds can be scattered when passing through the
cluster medium. This problem has been recently considered for the radio and the
cosmic infrared background. Here we revisit the discussion of the cosmic
infrared background (CIB) including several additional effects that were
omitted before. We discuss the {\it intracluster} scattering of the CIB and the
role of {\it relativistic} temperature corrections to the individual cluster
and all-sky averaged signals. We show that the all-sky CIB distortion
introduced by the scattering of the photon field was underestimated by a factor
of $\simeq 1.5$ due to neglecting the intracluster scattering contribution.
Energy is essentially transferred twice from the thermal electrons to the CIB.
We carefully clarify the origin of various effects in the calculation of the
average CIB and also scattered signals. The single-cluster CIB scattering
signal also exhibits a clear redshift dependence, which can be used in
cosmological analyses, as we describe both analytically and numerically. This

caused by the camera equipment and the urban style. Faced with these two types
of domain shifts, i.e., the illumination and the inherent difference of the

correlation distillation, called CCDistill. The invariance of illumination or
inherent difference between two images is fully explored so as to make up for
the lack of labels for nighttime images. Specifically, we extract the content
and style knowledge contained in features, calculate the degree of inherent or

using the invariance of the same kind of difference. Extensive experiments on

multi-agent setting through the use of action models with pre- and

epistemic logic (DFOEL), with a proof that the resulting Epistemic Planning
Problem is decidable, as long as action models pre- and post-conditions are
non-modal and the first-order domain is finite. Our contribution highlights the
role post-conditions have in DFOEL. We show that the Epistemic Planning Problem
with possibly infinite first-order domains is undecidable if the non-modal
event post-conditions may contain first-order quantifiers, while, on the
contrary, the problem becomes decidable when event post-conditions are
quantifier-free. The latter result is non-trivial and makes an extensive use of
automatic structures.

Bose-Hubbard model featuring emergent bulk criticality. On top of an insulating
bulk, the open edges experience a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition into the
superfluid phase when the hopping strength is sufficiently enhanced on edges.
At the bulk critical point, the open edges exhibit the special, ordinary, and
extraordinary critical phases. In the extraordinary phase, logarithms are
involved in the finite-size scaling of two-point correlation and superfluid
stiffness, which admit a classical-quantum correspondence for the
extraordinary-log universality. Thanks to modern quantum emulators for
interacting bosons in lattices, the edge critical phases might be realized in
experiments.

bubble of nothing and we discuss the derivation of the euclidean action.
Secondly we consider a ""stringy"" non-supersymmetric AdS$_4$ vacuum arising in a
compactification of massive IIA supergravity on a $S^6$ and preserving G$_2$
symmetry. This vacuum has been shown to have a fully stable KK spectrum and
also be protected against brane-jet decays. In this framework we discuss a
bubble solution in massive IIA connected to the G$_2$-invariant vacuum and
associated to an instability channel. We finally provide the interpretation of
this instability in terms of the nucleation of a bubble of nothing dressed up

precoders for each group are separately designed on a symbol-by-symbol basis by
only utilizing the symbol information of the users in that group, in which the
intra-group MUI is exploited using the concept of constructive interference
(CI) and the inter-group MUI is also effectively suppressed. In order to
further reduce the computational complexity, we utilize the Lagrangian dual,
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the majorization-minimization (MM)
method to transform the resulting problems into more tractable forms, and
develop efficient algorithms for obtaining closed-form solutions to them.
Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed G-SLP strategy and

industries. In addition to guidelines and best practices, many industries
already have safety management systems (SMSs) designed to monitor and reinforce
good safety behaviors. The analytic capabilities to analyze the data acquired
through such systems, however, are still lacking in terms of their ability to
robustly quantify risks posed by various occupational hazards. Moreover, best
practices and modern SMSs are unable to account for dynamically evolving
environments/behavioral characteristics commonly found in many industrial
settings. This article proposes a method to address these issues by enabling
continuous and quantitative assessment of safety risks in a data-driven manner.
The backbone of our method is an intuitive hierarchical probabilistic model
that explains sparse and noisy safety data collected by a typical SMS. A fully
Bayesian approach is developed to calibrate this model from safety data in an
online fashion. Thereafter, the calibrated model holds necessary information
that serves to characterize risk posed by different safety hazards.
Additionally, the proposed model can be leveraged for automated decision
making, for instance solving resource allocation problems -- targeted towards
risk mitigation -- that are often encountered in resource-constrained
industrial environments. The methodology is rigorously validated on a simulated
test-bed and its scalability is demonstrated on real data from large
maintenance projects at a petrochemical plant.

to probe this phase over a large energy and temperature window. We demonstrate
that the optical signatures of the strange metal phase persist throughout the

two-fold, (i): a low energy Drude response with Drude width on the order of
temperature and (ii): a high energy conformal tail with doping dependent
power-law exponent. While the Drude weight evolves monotonously throughout the
entire doping range studied, the spectral weight contained in the high energy
conformal tail appears to be doping and temperature independent. Our analysis
further shows that the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity is
completely determined by the Drude parameters. Our results indicate that there
is no critical doping level inside the superconducting dome where the carrier
density starts to change drastically and that the previously observed 'return
to normalcy' is a consequence of the increasing importance of the Drude
component relative to the conformal tail with doping. Importantly, both the

realistic networks are difficult to be verified by classical methods. To
alleviate this issue, we propose to use QC for neural network verification and

  Neighborhood Aggregation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph contrastive learning (GCL), as a popular approach to graph
self-supervised learning, has recently achieved a non-negligible effect. To
achieve superior performance, the majority of existing GCL methods elaborate on
graph data augmentation to construct appropriate contrastive pairs. However,
existing methods place more emphasis on the complex graph data augmentation
which requires extra time overhead, and pay less attention to developing
contrastive schemes specific to encoder characteristics. We argue that a better
contrastive scheme should be tailored to the characteristics of graph neural
networks (e.g., neighborhood aggregation) and propose a simple yet effective
method named FastGCL. Specifically, by constructing weighted-aggregated and
non-aggregated neighborhood information as positive and negative samples
respectively, FastGCL identifies the potential semantic information of data
without disturbing the graph topology and node attributes, resulting in faster
training and convergence speeds. Extensive experiments have been conducted on
node classification and graph classification tasks, showing that FastGCL has
competitive classification performance and significant training speedup
compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

  the literature",,,,"hep-th gr-qc quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We develop a framework based on the covariant phase space formalism that
identifies gravitational edge modes as dynamical reference frames. They enable
the identification of the associated spacetime region and the imposition of
boundary conditions in a gauge-invariant manner. While recent proposals
considered the finite region in isolation and sought the maximal symmetry
algebra compatible with that perspective, we regard it as a subregion embedded
in a global spacetime and study the symmetries consistent with such an
embedding. This clarifies that the frame, although appearing as ""new"" for the
subregion, is built out of the field content of the complement. Given a global
variational principle, this also permits us to invoke a systematic
post-selection procedure, previously used in gauge theory [arXiv:2109.06184],
to produce consistent dynamics for a subregion with timelike boundary.
Requiring the subregion presymplectic structure to be conserved by the dynamics
leads to an essentially unique prescription and unambiguous Hamiltonian
charges. Unlike other proposals, this has the advantage that all spacetime
diffeomorphisms acting on the subregion remain gauge and integrable, thus
generating a first-class constraint algebra. By contrast, diffeomorphisms
acting on the frame-dressed spacetime are physical, and those that are parallel
to the boundary are integrable. Further restricting to ones preserving the
boundary conditions yields an algebra of conserved charges. These record
changes in the relation between the region and its complement as measured by
frame reorientations. Finally, we explain how the boundary conditions and
presymplectic structure can be encoded into boundary actions. While our
formalism applies to any generally covariant theory, we illustrate it on
general relativity, and conclude with a detailed comparison of our findings to
earlier works. [abridged]

However, noise accumulates as we perform operations on HE-encrypted data,
restricting the number of possible operations. Fully HE (FHE) removes this
restriction by introducing the bootstrapping operation, which refreshes the
data; however, FHE schemes are highly memory-bound. Bootstrapping, in
particular, requires loading GBs of evaluation keys and plaintexts from
off-chip memory, which makes FHE acceleration fundamentally bottlenecked by the
off-chip memory bandwidth.
  In this paper, we propose ARK, an Accelerator for FHE with Runtime data

with a novel algorithm-architecture co-design to accelerate bootstrapping. We
first eliminate the off-chip memory bandwidth bottleneck through runtime data
generation and inter-operation key reuse. This approach enables ARK to fully

On top of such algorithmic enhancements, we build ARK microarchitecture that
minimizes on-chip data movement through an efficient, alternating data
distribution policy based on the data access patterns and a streamlined
dataflow organization of the tailored functional units -- including base
conversion, number-theoretic transform, and automorphism units. Overall, our
co-design effectively handles the heavy computation and data movement overheads

bootstrapping.

used a weak supervision approach based on Snorkel to annotate the ORCAS dataset
according to our new user intent taxonomy, utilising established heuristics and
keywords to construct rules for the prediction of the intent category. We then
present a series of experiments with a variety of machine learning models,
using the labels from the weak supervision stage as training data, but find
that the results produced by Snorkel are not outperformed by these competing
approaches and can be considered state-of-the-art. The advantage of a
rule-based approach like Snorkel's is its efficient deployment in an actual
system, where intent classification would be executed for every query issued.
The resource released with this paper is the ORCAS-I dataset: a labelled
version of the ORCAS click-based dataset of Web queries, which provides 18
million connections to 10 million distinct queries.

black hole (and candidate) low-mass X-ray binaries for signatures of
reverberation. Reverberation lags result from the light travel time difference
between the direct coronal emission and the reflected disk component, and
therefore their properties are a useful probe of the disk-corona geometry. We
detect new signatures of reverberation lags in 8 sources, increasing the total
sample from 3 to 11, and study the evolution of reverberation lag properties as
the sources evolve in outbursts. We find that in all of the 9 sources with more
than 1 reverberation lag detection, the reverberation lags become longer and
dominate at lower Fourier frequencies during the hard-to-soft state transition.
This result shows that the evolution in reverberation lags is a global property
of the state transitions of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, which is
valuable in constraining models of such state transitions. The reverberation
lag evolution suggests that the corona is the base of a jet which vertically
expands and/or gets ejected during state transition. We also discover that in
the hard state, the reverberation lags get shorter, just as the QPOs move to
higher frequencies, but then in the state transition, while the QPOs continue
to higher frequencies, the lags get longer. We discuss implications for the
coronal geometry and physical models of QPOs in light of this new finding.

improves the recent result of Bardos and Titi obtained in the planar case to

this paper, we approach this problem systematically by developing a

is capable of prioritizing the experience replay, selecting the most

encourages the agent to explore with a curiosity-based reward. As a result, the

invariances more efficiently, with significantly reduced augmented inputs. We
apply CCLF to several base RL algorithms and evaluate on the DeepMind Control

starting with a realistic model for the $\gamma N \to \pi^0 \eta N$ reaction
that reproduces cross sections and polarization observables at low energies and
involves the $\gamma N \to \Delta(1700)\to \eta \Delta(1232) \to \eta \pi^0 N$
process. For the coherent reaction in the deuteron we considered the impulse
approximation together with the rescattering of the pions and the $\eta$ on a
different nucleon than the one where they are produced. We found this second
mechanism very important since it helps share between two nucleons the
otherwise large momentum transfer of the reaction. Other contributions to the
$\gamma d\to\pi^0\eta d$ reaction, involving the $\gamma N\to \pi^\pm\pi^0
N^\prime$ process, followed by the rescattering of the $\pi^\pm$ with another
nucleon to give $\eta$ and a nucleon, have also been included. We find a
natural explanation, tied to the dynamics of our model, for the shift of the
$\eta-d$ mass distribution to lower invariant masses, and of the $\pi^0-d$ mass
distribution to larger invariant masses, compared to a phase space calculation.
We also study theoretical uncertainties related to the large momenta of the
deuteron wave function involved in the process as well as to the couplings

across a variety of question answering tasks. Our multi-task mixture training
learns from tasks of various question intents and thus generalizes better,
including on zero-shot vision-language tasks. We conduct experiments in the
challenging multi-task and open-vocabulary settings and across a variety of
datasets and tasks, such as VQA2.0, SNLI-VE, NLVR2, GQA. We observe that the

circular spots containing spores on corn leaves. Tar spot has proven to be an
impactful disease in terms of reducing crop yield. To quantify disease
progression, experts usually have to visually phenotype leaves from the plant.
This process is very time-consuming and is difficult to incorporate in any

automated tar spot detection with sufficient ground truth. However, manually
labeling tar spots in images to serve as ground truth is also tedious and
time-consuming. In this paper we first describe an approach that uses automated
image analysis tools to generate ground truth images that are then used for
training a Mask R-CNN. We show that a Mask R-CNN can be used effectively to
detect tar spots in close-up images of leaf surfaces. We additionally show that
the Mask R-CNN can also be used for in-field images of whole leaves to capture
the number of tar spots and area of the leaf infected by the disease.

system security, since information on attacks, the current system status or the
attacker's incentives is often vague, uncertain and in many cases even
unavailable. Game theory is a natural approach to model the conflict between
the attacker and the defender, and this work investigates a generalized class
of matrix games as a risk mitigation tool for an APT defense. Unlike standard
game and decision theory, our model is tailored to capture and handle the full
uncertainty that is immanent to APT, such as disagreement among qualitative
expert risk assessments, unknown adversarial incentives and uncertainty about
the current system state (in terms of how deeply the attacker may have

common risk management standards like the ISO 31000 family. Theoretically,
these models come with different properties than classical game theoretic

honeycomb lattice with Ir-Ir dimer formation and a collapsed interlayer
separation. In the stability range of the low-pressure monoclinic phase,
structural evolution maintains the Kitaev configuration up to 4 GPa. This is
supported by the observed enhanced magnetic frustration in dc susceptibility
without emergence of any magnetic ordering and an enhanced dynamic Raman
susceptibility. High-pressure resistance measurements up to 25 GPa in the

Consequently, in the online setting, this results in disconnections of
tracklets which cannot be recovered. In this regard, we present Sparse Graph
Tracker (SGT), a novel online graph tracker using higher-order relational
features which are more discriminative by aggregating the features of
neighboring detections and their relations. SGT converts video data into a
graph where detections, their connections, and the relational features of two

respectively. The strong edge features allow SGT to track targets with tracking
candidates selected by top-K scored detections with large K. As a result, even

involve modulating the activity of cellular processes and determining the
resulting changes in energetic fluxes. In this review, we present a flux
balance framework to aid in the design and interpretation of such experiments,
and discuss the challenges associated with measuring the relevant metabolic

  Passage Retrieval","Accepted by VLDB 2023",,,,"cs.IR cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many recent approaches of passage retrieval are using dense embeddings
generated from deep neural models, called ""dense passage retrieval"". The
state-of-the-art end-to-end dense passage retrieval systems normally deploy a
deep neural model followed by an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
module. The model generates embeddings of the corpus and queries, which are
then indexed and searched by the high-performance ANN module. With the
increasing data scale, the ANN module unavoidably becomes the bottleneck on
efficiency. An alternative is the learned index, which achieves significantly
high search efficiency by learning the data distribution and predicting the
target data location. But most of the existing learned indexes are designed for
low dimensional data, which are not suitable for dense passage retrieval with
high-dimensional dense embeddings. In this paper, we propose LIDER, an
efficient high-dimensional Learned Index for large-scale DEnse passage
Retrieval. LIDER has a clustering-based hierarchical architecture formed by two
layers of core models. As the basic unit of LIDER to index and search data, a
core model includes an adapted recursive model index (RMI) and a dimension
reduction component which consists of an extended SortingKeys-LSH (SK-LSH) and
a key re-scaling module. The dimension reduction component reduces the
high-dimensional dense embeddings into one-dimensional keys and sorts them in a
specific order, which are then used by the RMI to make fast prediction.
Experiments show that LIDER has a higher search speed with high retrieval
quality comparing to the state-of-the-art ANN indexes on passage retrieval
tasks, e.g., on large-scale data it achieves 1.2x search speed and
significantly higher retrieval quality than the fastest baseline in our
evaluation. Furthermore, LIDER has a better capability of speed-quality
trade-off.

analogue of the FEAST method has been proposed for DEPs without discretization
of the coefficient operators. Compared to conventional ""discretize-then-solve""
approaches that discretize the operators and solve the resulting matrix
problem, the operator analogue of FEAST exhibits much higher accuracy; however,
it involves solving a large number of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
In this paper, to reduce the computational costs, we propose operation
analogues of Sakurai-Sugiura-type complex moment-based eigensolvers for DEPs
using higher-order complex moments and analyze the error bound of the proposed

factor of the degree of complex moments without degrading accuracy, which is
verified by numerical results. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
methods are over five times faster compared with the operator analogue of FEAST
for several DEPs while maintaining almost the same high accuracy. This study is
expected to promote the ""solve-then-discretize"" paradigm for solving DEPs and
contribute to faster and more accurate solutions in real-world applications.

improve recommendation quality. In those recommender systems, knowledge graph
information often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness
among items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality
knowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two
challenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse
supervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world
knowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections
between items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity
dependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which
significantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate
representation of user's preference.
  To fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive
Learning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge
graph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph
augmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive
more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit
additional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a
cross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased
user-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent
superiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves
strong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item
interactions, long-tail and noisy KG entities. Our implementation codes are

analyzing the ensemble is to partition (or segment) the multi-dimensional

behavior. To facilitate such an analysis, we propose a novel visualization
method for multi-dimensional parameter-space partitions. Our visualization is
based on the concept of a hyper-slicer, which allows for undistorted views of

parameter space, interactions with a 2D embedding of the parameter-space
samples, including their segment memberships, are supported. Parameter-space
partitions are generated in a semi-automatic fashion by analyzing the
similarity space of the ensemble's simulation runs. Clusters of similar
simulation runs induce the segments of the parameter-space partition. We link
the parameter-space partitioning visualizations to similarity-space
visualizations of the ensemble's simulation runs and embed them into an
interactive visual analysis tool that supports the analysis of all facets of
the spatio-temporal simulation ensemble targeted at the overarching goal of
analyzing the parameter-space partitioning. The partitioning can then be
visually analyzed and interactively refined. We evaluated our approach with

its applications in various domains ranging from online advertising to clinical
trials. In practice however, the number of arms can be very large resulting in
large memory requirements for simultaneously processing them. In this paper we
consider a streaming setting where the arms are presented in a stream and the
algorithm uses limited memory to process these arms. Here, the goal is not only
to minimize regret, but also to do so in minimal memory. Previous algorithms
for this problem operate in one of the two settings: they either use
$\Omega(\log \log T)$ passes over the stream (Rathod, 2021; Chaudhuri and
Kalyanakrishnan, 2020; Liau et al., 2018), or just a single pass (Maiti et al.,
2021).
  In this paper we study the trade-off between memory and regret when $B$
passes over the stream are allowed, for any $B \geq 1$, and establish tight
regret upper and lower bounds for any $B$-pass algorithm. Our results uncover a
surprising *sharp transition phenomenon*: $O(1)$ memory is sufficient to
achieve $\widetilde\Theta\Big(T^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{B+2}-2}}\Big)$
regret in $B$ passes, and increasing the memory to any quantity that is $o(K)$
has almost no impact on further reducing this regret, unless we use $\Omega(K)$
memory. Our main technical contribution is our lower bound which requires the
use of information-theoretic techniques as well as ideas from round elimination
to show that the *residual problem* remains challenging over subsequent passes.

order to allow for imaging with both high resolution and high contrast. The
inversion procedure often consists of two steps: first, internal measurements
involving the unknown parameters and some related quantities are obtained, and,
second, the unknown parameters have to be reconstructed from the internal data.
The reconstruction in the second step requires the solutions of certain PDE to
satisfy some non-zero constraints, such as the absence of nodal or critical
points, or a non-vanishing Jacobian.
  In this work, we consider a second-order elliptic PDE and show that it is
possible to satisfy these constraints with overwhelming probability by choosing
the boundary values randomly, following a sub-Gaussian distribution. The proof
is based on a new quantitative estimate for the Runge approximation, a result

users' privacy in data analysis, machine, and deep learning. Existing DP-based
privacy-preserving training approaches consist of adding noise to the clients'
gradients before sharing them with the server. However, implementing DP on the
gradient is not efficient as the privacy leakage increases by increasing the
synchronization training epochs due to the composition theorem. Recently
researchers were able to recover images used in the training dataset using
Generative Regression Neural Network (GRNN) even when the gradient was
protected by DP. In this paper, we propose two layers of privacy protection
approach to overcome the limitations of the existing DP-based approaches. The
first layer reduces the dimension of the training dataset based on Hensel's
Lemma. We are the first to use Hensel's Lemma for reducing the dimension (i.e.,
compress) of a dataset. The new dimensionality reduction method allows reducing
the dimension of a dataset without losing information since Hensel's Lemma
guarantees uniqueness. The second layer applies DP to the compressed dataset
generated by the first layer. The proposed approach overcomes the problem of
privacy leakage due to composition by applying DP only once before the
training; clients train their local model on the privacy-preserving dataset
generated by the second layer. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach ensures strong privacy protection while achieving good accuracy. The
new dimensionality reduction method achieves an accuracy of 97%, with only 25 %
of the original data size.

Structural Damage Detection (SDD) in extreme events using deep learning methods
for processing 2D images. In the first study, a 152-layer Residual network
(ResNet) is utilized to classify multiple classes in eight SDD tasks, which
include identification of scene levels, damage levels, material types, etc. The
proposed ResNet achieved high accuracy for each task while the positions of the
damage are not identifiable. In the second study, the existing ResNet and a
segmentation network (U-Net) are combined into a new pipeline, cascaded
networks, for categorizing and locating structural damage. The results show
that the accuracy of damage detection is significantly improved compared to
only using a segmentation network. In the third and fourth studies, end-to-end
networks are developed and tested as a new solution to directly detect cracks
and spalling in the image collections of recent large earthquakes. One of the
proposed networks can achieve an accuracy above 67.6% for all tested images at
various scales and resolutions, and shows its robustness for these human-free
detection tasks. As a preliminary field study, we applied the proposed method
to detect damage in a concrete structure that was tested to study its
progressive collapse performance. The experiments indicate that these solutions
for automatic detection of structural damage using deep learning methods are
feasible and promising. The training datasets and codes will be made available
for the public upon the publication of this paper.

applied in various research areas, including the education domain. Higher
Education institutions strive to improve students' academic performance. Early
intervention to at-risk students and a reasonable curriculum is vital for
students' success. Prior research opted for deploying traditional machine
learning models to predict students' performance. In terms of curriculum
semantic analysis, after conducting a comprehensive systematic review regarding
the use of semantic technologies in the Computer Science curriculum, a major
finding of the study is that technologies used to measure similarity have
limitations in terms of accuracy and ambiguity in the representation of
concepts, courses, etc. To fill these gaps, in this study, three
implementations were developed, that is, to predict students' performance using
marks from the previous semester, to model a course representation in a
semantic way and compute the similarity, and to identify the prerequisite
between two similar courses. Regarding performance prediction, we used the
combination of Genetic Algorithm and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) on a dataset
from a Brazilian university containing 248730 records. As for similarity
measurement, we deployed BERT to encode the sentences and used cosine
similarity to obtain the distance between courses. With respect to prerequisite
identification, TextRazor was applied to extract concepts from course
description, followed by employing SemRefD to measure the degree of
prerequisite between two concepts. The outcomes of this study can be summarized
as: (i) a breakthrough result improves Manrique's work by 2.5% in terms of
accuracy in dropout prediction; (ii) uncover the similarity between courses
based on course description; (iii) identify the prerequisite over three
compulsory courses of School of Computing at ANU.

advancements in representation learning have been shown to greatly improve the
performance of molecular property prediction. However, due to limited labeled
data, supervised learning-based molecular representation algorithms can only
search limited chemical space, which results in poor generalizability. In this
work, we proposed a self-supervised representation learning framework for
large-scale unlabeled molecules. We developed a novel molecular graph
augmentation strategy, referred to as attention-wise graph mask, to generate
challenging positive sample for contrastive learning. We adopted the graph
attention network (GAT) as the molecular graph encoder, and leveraged the
learned attention scores as masking guidance to generate molecular augmentation
graphs. By minimization of the contrastive loss between original graph and
masked graph, our model can capture important molecular structure and
higher-order semantic information. Extensive experiments showed that our
attention-wise graph mask contrastive learning exhibit state-of-the-art
performance in a couple of downstream molecular property prediction tasks.

expensive function evaluations. In multi-objective optimisation problems, BO
aims to find a set of approximated Pareto optimal solutions. There are
typically two ways to build surrogates in multi-objective BO: One surrogate by
aggregating objective functions (by using a scalarising function, also called
mono-surrogate approach) and multiple surrogates (for each objective function,
also called multi-surrogate approach). In both approaches, an acquisition
function (AF) is used to guide the search process. Mono-surrogate has the
advantage that only one model is used, however, the approach has two major
limitations. Firstly, the fitness landscape of the scalarising function and the
objective functions may not be similar. Secondly, the approach assumes that the
scalarising function distribution is Gaussian, and thus a closed-form
expression of the AF can be used. In this work, we overcome these limitations
by building a surrogate model for each objective function and show that the
scalarising function distribution is not Gaussian. We approximate the
distribution using Generalised extreme value distribution. The results and
comparison with existing approaches on standard benchmark and real-world
optimisation problems show the potential of the multi-surrogate approach.
