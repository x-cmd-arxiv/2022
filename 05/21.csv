  Conversation Contex","5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The development of virtual agents has enabled human-avatar interactions to
become increasingly rich and varied. Moreover, an expressive virtual agent i.e.
that mimics the natural expression of emotions, enhances social interaction
between a user (human) and an agent (intelligent machine). The set of
non-verbal behaviors of a virtual character is, therefore, an important
component in the context of human-machine interaction. Laughter is not just an
audio signal, but an intrinsic relationship of multimodal non-verbal
communication, in addition to audio, it includes facial expressions and body
movements. Motion analysis often relies on a relevant motion capture dataset,
but the main issue is that the acquisition of such a dataset is expensive and
time-consuming. This work studies the relationship between laughter and body
movements in dyadic conversations. The body movements were extracted from
videos using deep learning based pose estimator model. We found that, in the
explored NDC-ME dataset, a single statistical feature (i.e, the maximum value,
or the maximum of Fourier transform) of a joint movement weakly correlates with
laughter intensity by 30%. However, we did not find a direct correlation
between audio features and body movements. We discuss about the challenges to
use such dataset for the audio-driven co-laughter motion synthesis task.

the latter previously operationalized via the application of compression
algorithms. Here we generalize and extend the compression approach beyond
simple complexity measures to quantify algorithmic distance in historical and
contemporary visual media. The proposed ""ensemble"" approach works by
compressing a large number of transformed versions of a given input image,
resulting in a vector of associated compression ratios. This approach is more
efficient than other compression-based algorithmic distances, and is
particularly suited for the quantitative analysis of visual artifacts, because
human creative processes can be understood as algorithms in the broadest sense.
Unlike comparable image embedding methods using machine learning, our approach
is fully explainable through the transformations. We demonstrate that the
method is cognitively plausible and fit for purpose by evaluating it against
human complexity judgments, and on automated detection tasks of authorship and
style. We show how the approach can be used to reveal and quantify trends in
art historical data, both on the scale of centuries and in rapidly evolving
contemporary NFT art markets. We further quantify temporal resemblance to
disambiguate artists outside the documented mainstream from those who are
deeply embedded in Zeitgeist. Finally, we note that compression ensembles
constitute a quantitative representation of the concept of visual family
resemblance, as distinct sets of dimensions correspond to shared visual
characteristics otherwise hard to pin down. Our approach provides a new
perspective for the study of visual art, algorithmic image analysis, and
quantitative aesthetics more generally.

particles undergoing stochastic resetting to the origin in 1d. We start with
the basic reset model where the particles reset independently (model A). Then
we introduce nonlocal interparticle correlations by postulating that only the
particle farthest from the origin is reset (model B). At long times both models
approach nonequilibrium steady states. In the limit of $N\to \infty$, the
steady-state particle density in model A has an infinite support, whereas in
model B it has a compact support. A finite system radius, which scales at large
$N$ as $\ln N$, appears in model A when $N$ is finite. In both models we study
stationary fluctuations of the center of mass of the system and of the system's
radius due to the random character of the Brownian motion and of the resetting
events. In model A we determine exact distributions of these two quantities.
The variance of the center of mass for both models scales as $1/N$. The
variance of the radius is independent of $N$ in model A and exhibits an unusual
scaling $(\ln N)/N$ in model B. The latter scaling is intimately related to the
$1/f$ noise in the radius autocorrelations. Finally, we evaluate the mean
first-passage time (MFPT) to a distant target in model A, model B, and the BBM.
For model A we obtain an exact asymptotic expression for the MFPT which scales
as $1/N$. For model B, and for the ""Brownian bees"" model, we propose a sharp
upper bound for the MFPT. The bound assumes an ``evaporation"" scenario, where
the first passage requires multiple attempts of a single particle, which breaks
away from the rest of the particles, to reach the target. The resulting MFPT
for model B and the Brownian bees model scales exponentially with $\sqrt{N}$.
We verify this bound by performing highly efficient weighted-ensemble
simulations of the first passage in model B.

modeling capabilities of neural networks for reconstructing sub-sampled
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Most proposed methods assume the
existence of a representative fully-sampled dataset and use fully-supervised
training. However, for many applications, fully sampled training data is not
available, and may be highly impractical to acquire. The development and
understanding of self-supervised methods, which use only sub-sampled data for
training, are therefore highly desirable. This work extends the Noisier2Noise
framework, which was originally constructed for self-supervised denoising
tasks, to variable density sub-sampled MRI data. We use the Noisier2Noise
framework to analytically explain the performance of Self-Supervised Learning
via Data Undersampling (SSDU), a recently proposed method that performs well in
practice but until now lacked theoretical justification. Further, we propose
two modifications of SSDU that arise as a consequence of the theoretical
developments. Firstly, we propose partitioning the sampling set so that the
subsets have the same type of distribution as the original sampling mask.
Secondly, we propose a loss weighting that compensates for the sampling and
partitioning densities. On the fastMRI dataset we show that these changes
significantly improve SSDU's image restoration quality and robustness to the

observations allow the study and imaging of the jet base on the sub-parsec
scale. This could facilitate the investigation of the nature of the jet origin,

$\gamma$-ray variability. For the moving jet features, we find an average
velocity of $\beta^\textrm{avg}_\textrm{app} = 0.055-0.22$c ($\mu^\textrm{avg}

dependent, with the jet being narrower at higher frequencies. This
stratification is discussed in the context of a spine-sheath scenario, and is
compared to other possible interpretations. From quasi-simultaneous

link prediction, node classification, and node clustering. In heterogeneous
text-rich networks, this task is more challenging due to (1) presence or
absence of text: Some nodes are associated with rich textual information, while
others are not; (2) diversity of types: Nodes and edges of multiple types form
a heterogeneous network structure. As pretrained language models (PLMs) have
demonstrated their effectiveness in obtaining widely generalizable text
representations, a substantial amount of effort has been made to incorporate
PLMs into representation learning on text-rich networks. However, few of them
can jointly consider heterogeneous structure (network) information as well as
rich textual semantic information of each node effectively. In this paper, we

Relativistic Mean-Field Theory (RMFT) that is optimized for application to
neutron star phenomenology. In the standard RMFT approach, the couplings are
constrained by comparing the theory's predictions for symmetric matter at
saturation density with measured nuclear properties. The theory is then applied
to neutron stars which consist of neutron-rich matter at densities ranging up
to several times saturation density, which allows for additional astrophysical
constraints. In our approach, rather than using the RMFT to extrapolate from
symmetric to neutron-rich matter and from finite-sized nuclei to uniform
matter, we fit the RMFT to properties of uniform pure neutron matter obtained
from chiral effective field theory. Chiral effective field theory incorporates
the experimental data for nuclei in the framework of a controlled expansion for
nuclear forces valid at nuclear densities and enables us to account for
theoretical uncertainties when fitting the RMFT. We construct four simple RMFTs
that span the uncertainties provided by chiral effective field theory for
neutron matter, and are consistent with current astrophysical constraints on
the equation of state. Our RMFTs can be used to model the properties of
neutron-rich matter across the vast range of densities and temperatures
encountered in neutron stars and their mergers.

nature, and are fundamental to understand complexity of networks beyond the
framework of simple graphs. Recently it has been pointed out that restricting
the attention to pairwise interactions is also a limitation, as the vast
majority of complex systems include higher-order interactions that strongly
affect their dynamics. Here, we propose hyper-diffusion on multiplex networks,
a dynamical process in which diffusion on each single layer is coupled with the
diffusion in other layers thanks to the presence of higher-order interactions
occurring when there exists link overlap. We show that hyper-diffusion on a
duplex network can be described by the Hyper-Laplacian in which the strength of
four-body interactions among every set of four replica nodes connected by a
multilink $(1,1)$ can be tuned by a parameter $\delta_{11}\ge 0$. The
Hyper-Laplacian reduces to the standard lower Laplacian, capturing pairwise
interactions at the two layers, when $\delta_{11}=0$. By combining tools of
spectral graph theory, applied topology and network science we provide a
general understanding of hyper-diffusion on duplex networks when
$\delta_{11}>0$, including theoretical bounds on the Fiedler and the largest
eigenvalue of Hyper-Laplacians and the asymptotic expansion of their spectrum
for $\delta_{11}\ll1$ and $\delta_{11}\gg1$. Although hyper-diffusion on
multiplex networks does not imply a direct ``transfer of mass"" among the layers
(i.e. the average state of replica nodes in each layer is a conserved quantity
of the dynamics), we find that the dynamics of the two layers is coupled as the
relaxation to the steady state becomes synchronous when higher-order
interactions are taken into account and the Fiedler eigenvalue of the
Hyper-Laplacian is not localized in a single layer of the duplex network.

guarantee. Using the technique of [OSVV08] for computing expander
decompositions or balanced cuts [RST14, SW19], encounters many hurdles. In
particular, in [RST14, SW19] the relevant part of the graph constantly changes,
making it difficult to perform spectral analysis.
  In this paper, we manage to exploit the technique of [OSVV08] to compute an
expander decomposition, improving the result by Saranurak and Wang [SW19].
Specifically, we give a randomized algorithm for computing a
$(\phi,\phi\log^2n)$-expander decomposition of a graph, in
$O(m\log^7m+\frac{m\log^4m}{\phi})$ time. Our new result is achieved by using a
novel combination of a symmetric version of the potential functions of [OSVV08,
RST14, SW19] with a new variation of Cheeger's inequality for the notion of
near-expansion.

stopping rules) solving the following ""hiring problem"": a decision maker
sequentially inspects candidates whose values are independent random numbers
and is asked to hire at most one candidate by selecting it before inspecting
the values of future candidates in the sequence. A classic result in optimal
stopping theory asserts that there exist stopping rules guaranteeing that the
decision maker will hire a candidate whose expected value is at least half as
good as the expected value of the candidate hired by a ""prophet"", i.e. one who
has simultaneous access to the realizations of all candidates' values.
  Such stopping rules have provably good performance but might treat individual
candidates unfairly in a number of different ways. In this work we identify two
types of individual fairness that might be desirable in optimal stopping
problems. We call them identity-independent fairness (IIF) and time-independent
fairness (TIF) and give precise definitions in the context of the hiring
problem. We give polynomial-time algorithms for finding the optimal IIF/TIF
stopping rules for a given instance with discrete support and we manage to
recover a prophet inequality with factor $1/2$ when the decision maker's
stopping rule is required to satisfy both fairness properties while the prophet
is unconstrained. We also explore worst-case ratios between optimal selection
rules in the presence vs. absence of individual fairness constraints, in both
the online and offline settings. Finally, we consider a framework in which the
decision maker doesn't know the distributions of candidates' values but has
access to independent samples from each distribution. We provide
constant-competitive IIF/TIF algorithms using one sample per distribution in
the offline setting and two samples per distribution in the online setting.

that precision electroweak constraints and the current bounds from the hadron

astroparticle physics as backgrounds are significantly reduced by only
considering interactions within the fiducial volume. In this work, we present
for the first time a method for position reconstruction using a Bayesian
network which provides per interaction uncertainties. We demonstrate the
utility of this method with simulated data based on the XENONnT detector
design, a dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber, as a proof-of-concept. The
network structure includes variables representing the 2D position of the
interaction within the detector, the number of electrons entering the gaseous
phase, and the hits measured by each sensor in the top array of the detector.
The precision of the position reconstruction (difference between the true and
expectation value of position) is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods --
an RMS of 0.69 cm, ~0.09 of the sensor spacing, for the inner part of the
detector (<60 cm) and 0.98 cm, ~0.12 of the sensor spacing, near the wall of
the detector (>60 cm). More importantly, the uncertainty of each interaction
position was directly computed, which is not possible with other reconstruction
methods. The method found a median 3-$\sigma$ confidence region of 11 cm$^2$
for the inner part of the detector and 21 cm$^2$ near the wall of the detector.
We found the Bayesian network framework to be well suited to the problem of
position reconstruction. The performance of this proof-of-concept, even with
several simplifying assumptions, shows that this is a promising method for
providing per interaction uncertainty, which can be extended to energy
reconstruction and signal classification.

on the isotropic and nematic phases at temperatures above unity. There we find
strong correlations between the virial and potential-energy thermal
fluctuations, reflecting the hidden-scale invariance symmetry. This implies the
existence of isomorphs, which are curves in the thermodynamic phase diagram of
approximately invariant physics. We study numerically one isomorph in the
isotropic phase and one in the nematic phase. In both cases, good invariance of
the dynamics is demonstrated via data for the reduced-unit time-autocorrelation
functions of the mean-square displacement, angular velocity, force, torque, and
first- and second-order Legendre polynomial orientational order parameters.
Deviations from isomorph invariance are observed at short times for the
orientational time-autocorrelation functions, which reflects the fact that the
moment of inertia is assumed to be constant and thus not isomorph invariant in
reduced units. Structural isomorph invariance is demonstrated from data for the
radial distribution functions of the particles and their orientations. For
comparison, all quantities were also simulated along an isochore of similar
temperature variation in which case invariance is not observed. We conclude
that the thermodynamic phase diagram of the calamitic Gay-Berne model is
essentially one-dimensional in the studied regions as predicted by isomorph
theory, a fact that potentially allows for simplifications of future theories
and numerical studies.

robustly captures accurate frictional contact responses. We showcase our

these geometric problems, many normalization approaches have been adopted for
EA. However, the increasing scale of KGs renders it hard for EA models to adopt
the normalization processes, thus limiting their usage in real-world

large-scale KGs, including stochastic training, ClusterSampler, and
SparseFusion. It first trains a large-scale Siamese GNN for EA in a stochastic
fashion to produce entity embeddings. Based on the embeddings, a novel
ClusterSampler strategy is proposed for sampling highly overlapped
mini-batches. Finally, ClusterEA incorporates SparseFusion, which normalizes
local and global similarity and then fuses all similarity matrices to obtain
the final similarity matrix. Extensive experiments with real-life datasets on

The success of DL is usually explained by focusing analysis on a particular

how they have evolved over time. We argue that cultural evolution is a useful
framework to explain the success of DL. In analogy to biology, we use
`development' to mean the process converting the pseudocode or text description
of an algorithm into a fully trained model. This includes writing the
programming code, compiling and running the program, and training the model. If
all parts of the process don't align well then the resultant model will be
useless (if the code runs at all!). This is a constraint. A core component of
evolutionary developmental biology is the concept of deconstraints -- these are
modification to the developmental process that avoid complete failure by
automatically accommodating changes in other components. We suggest that many
important innovations in DL, from neural networks themselves to hyperparameter
optimization and AutoGrad, can be seen as developmental deconstraints. These
deconstraints can be very helpful to both the particular algorithm in how it
handles challenges in implementation and the overall field of DL in how easy it
is for new ideas to be generated. We highlight how our perspective can both
advance DL and lead to new insights for evolutionary biology.

(or buy, or watch, or renew, etc.), whether exposed to the standard experience
A or a new one B, hypothetically it could be because the change affects no one,
because the change positively affects half the user population to go from

decision to implement a change or not, whether due to fairness, long-term,

tightest-possible (i.e., sharp) bounds on the fraction negatively affected (and
other related estimands) given data with only factual observations, whether

still gives valid conservative bounds when most are mislearned. Our methodology

demonstrate our method in simulation studies and in a case study of career

with time, and this leaves an imprint on the small-scale temperature
fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), a signal known as the
Rees-Sciama (RS) effect. Building on previous studies, here we investigate the
detectability of the RS effect by cross-correlating upcoming CMB and
Large-Scale Structure surveys. We include tracers with realistic number density
and bias, realistic noise for upcoming and future CMB experiments, and
importantly, the contribution from CMB foregrounds to the noise budget. We also
derive optimal redshift weights, which are crucial to the detection due to the
mismatch between the redshift kernel of the RS effect and the typical redshift
distribution of current and upcoming galaxy surveys. In agreement with previous
work, we confirm that the signal would in principle be detectable at high
significance by ""white noise"" versions of future CMB experiments, when
foregrounds are not included as part of the noise. However, we show that
inclusion of foregrounds limits the statistical detectability of the signal: an
optimally-weighted high-redshift sample from Rubin Observatory LSST, together
with CMB maps from CMB-S4 or CMB-HD, can yield a detection with signal-to-noise
6 - 8, when taking $\ell_{\rm max} = 6000$, provided that foreground-induced
biases can be successfully controlled. Improvements are possible if the total
power from foregrounds is further reduced, for example by more aggressive
masking, or if the signal can be modeled down to smaller scales.

central object with the cosmological fluid. We show that the horizons
associated with this metric change with cosmic time because they are coupled to
the cosmic evolution as the mass of the central object is always proportional
to the scale factor: it decreases during contraction and increases during
expansion phases. After a full analysis of the causal structure of this
spacetime, we determine that a dynamical black hole persists during the
contraction, bounce, and expansion of the universe. This result implies that
there is a class of bouncing models that admits black holes at all cosmological
epochs. If these models are correct approximation to the real universe, then
black holes surviving a cosmic collapse could play some role in the subsequent
expanding phase.

fundamental quantities that could give a link to the early universe physics. In
this paper we develop an approximate method to compute the nonlinear matter
power spectrum, $P(k)$, for ""non-flat"" $\Lambda$CDM models using the separate
universe (SU) ansatz which states that the effect of the curvature on structure
formation is equivalent to that of long-wavelength density fluctuation
($\delta_{\rm b}$) in a local volume in the ""flat"" $\Lambda$CDM model, via the
specific mapping between the background cosmological parameters and redshifts
in the non-flat and flat models. By utilizing the fact that the normalized
response of $P(k)$ to $\delta_{\rm b}$ (equivalently $\Omega_K$), which
describes how the non-zero $\Omega_K$ alters $P(k)$ as a function of $k$, is
well approximated by the response to the Hubble parameter $h$ within the flat
model, our method allows one to generalize the prediction of $P(k)$ for flat
cosmologies via fitting formulae or emulators to that for non-flat cosmologies.
We use $N$-body simulations for the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM models with
$|\Omega_K|\leq 0.1$ to show that our method can predict $P(k)$ for non-flat
models up to $k \simeq 6\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $z\simeq
[0,1.5]$, to the fractional accuracy within $\sim 1$% that roughly corresponds
to requirements for weak lensing cosmology with upcoming surveys. We find that
the emulators, those built for flat cosmologies such as EuclidEmulator, can
predict the non-flat $P(k)$ with least degradation.

How the masses and spins of new particles active during
inflation can be read off from the statistical properties of primordial density
fluctuations is well understood. However, not when the propagation speeds of
the new degrees of freedom and of the curvature perturbation differ, which is
the generic situation in the effective field theory of inflationary
fluctuations. Here we use bootstrap techniques to find exact analytical
solutions for primordial 2-,3- and 4-point correlators in this context. We
focus on the imprints of a heavy relativistic scalar coupled to the curvature
perturbation that propagates with a reduced speed of sound $c_s$, hence
strongly breaking de Sitter boosts. We show that akin to the de Sitter
invariant setup, primordial correlation functions can be deduced by acting with
suitable weight-shifting operators on the four-point function of a conformally
coupled field induced by the exchange of the massive scalar. However, this
procedure requires the analytical continuation of this seed correlator beyond
the physical domain implied by momentum conservation. We bootstrap this seed
correlator in the extended domain from first principles, starting from the
boundary equation that it satisfies due to locality. We further impose
unitarity, reflected in cosmological cutting rules, and analyticity, by
demanding regularity in the collinear limit of the four-point configuration, in
order to find the unique solution. Equipped with this, we unveil that heavy
particles that are lighter than $H/c_s$ leave smoking gun imprints in the
bispectrum in the form of resonances in the squeezed limit, a phenomenon that
we call the low speed collider. We characterise the overall shape of the signal
as well as its unusual logarithmic mass dependence, both vividly distinct from
previously identified signatures of heavy fields. (abridged)

plasma to an anisotropic one by replacing the Debye mass $m_D$ with an
anisotropic screening mass depending on the quark pair alignment with respect
to the direction of anisotropy. Such an angle-dependent mass is determined by
matching the perturbative contributions in the potential model to the exact
result obtained in the Hard-Thermal-Loop resummed perturbation theory. An
advantage of the resulting potential model is that its angular dependence can
be effectively described by using a set of angle-averaged screening masses as
proposed in our previous work. Consequently, one could solve a one-dimensional
Schr\""odinger equation with a potential model built by changing the anisotropic
screening masses into the corresponding angle-averaged ones, and reproduce the
full three-dimensional results for the binding energies and decay widths of
low-lying quarkonium bound states to very high accuracy. Finally, turning to
dynamics, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional effective potential can
accurately describe the time evolution of the vacuum overlaps obtained using
the full three-dimensional anisotropic potential. This includes the splitting
of different p-wave polarizations.

algorithm -- Aggressive Decoding. Unlike the previous efforts (e.g.,
non-autoregressive decoding) speeding up seq2seq generation at the cost of
quality loss, our approach aims to yield the identical (or better) generation
compared with autoregressive decoding but in a significant speedup, achieved by
innovative cooperation of aggressive decoding and verification that are both
efficient due to parallel computing.
  We propose two Aggressive Decoding paradigms for 2 kinds of seq2seq tasks: 1)
For the seq2seq tasks whose inputs and outputs are highly similar (e.g.,
Grammatical Error Correction), we propose Input-guided Aggressive Decoding
(IAD) that aggressively copies from the input sentence as drafted decoded
tokens to verify in parallel; 2) For other general seq2seq tasks (e.g., Machine
Translation), we propose Generalized Aggressive Decoding (GAD) that first
employs an additional non-autoregressive decoding model for aggressive decoding
and then verifies in parallel in the autoregressive manner.
  We test Aggressive Decoding on the most popular 6-layer Transformer model on
GPU in multiple seq2seq tasks: 1) For IAD, we show that it can introduce a
7x-9x speedup for the Transformer in Grammatical Error Correction and Text
Simplification tasks with the identical results as greedy decoding; 2) For GAD,
we observe a 3x-5x speedup with the identical or even better quality in two
important seq2seq tasks: Machine Translation and Abstractive Summarization.
Moreover, Aggressive Decoding can benefit even more from stronger computing
devices that are better at parallel computing. Given the lossless quality as
well as significant and promising speedup, we believe Aggressive Decoding may
potentially evolve into a de facto standard for efficient and lossless seq2seq
generation in the near future.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.10264",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Matrix Decomposition techniques have been a vital computational approach
to analyzing the hierarchy of functional connectivity in the human brain.
However, there are still four shortcomings of these methodologies: 1). Large
training samples; 2). Manually tuning hyperparameters; 3). Time-consuming and
require extensive computational source; 4). It cannot guarantee convergence to
a unique fixed point.
  Therefore, we propose a novel deep matrix factorization technique called Deep
Linear Matrix Approximate Reconstruction (DELMAR) to bridge the abovementioned
gaps. The advantages of the proposed method are: at first, proposed DELMAR can
estimate the important hyperparameters automatically; furthermore, DELMAR
employs the matrix backpropagation to reduce the potential accumulative errors;
finally, an orthogonal projection is introduced to update all variables of
DELMAR rather than directly calculating the inverse matrices.
  The validation experiments of three peer methods and DELMAR using real
functional MRI signal of the human brain demonstrates that our proposed method
can efficiently identify the spatial feature in fMRI signal even faster and
more accurately than other peer methods. Moreover, the theoretical analyses
indicate that DELMAR can converge to the unique fixed point and even enable the
accurate approximation of original input as DNNs.

In this paper, we use the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation, with a baryonic

galaxies around 1302 isolated galaxy clusters with mass $10^{13.0} < M_{\rm

extract features of galaxies that make them likely to be backsplash galaxies,

hole occupation fractions. We investigate in detail the origins of these large

the cluster. We show that the black hole recentreing scheme employed in many
cosmological simulations leads to the loss of black holes from galaxies

similar to the value measured for solar neighbourhood red clump stars giving

fragmentation results in different populations of stars when one considers the
initial conditions (e.g. density and temperature of the gravitationally
unstable regions). We find that opacity gaps in discs around $10^6 \rm
M_{\odot}$ SMBHs can trigger fragmentation at radii $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ pc,
although the conditions lead to the formation of initially low stellar masses
around $0.1-0.5 \rm M_{\odot}$. Discs around more massive SMBHs ($M_{\rm BH}
=10^{7-8} \rm M_{\odot}$) form moderately massive or supermassive stars (the
majority at $10^{0-2} \rm M_{\odot}$). Using linear migration estimates, we
discuss three outcomes: stars migrate till they are tidally destroyed, accreted
as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), or leftover after disc dispersal. For
a single AGN activity cycle, we find a lower-limit for the EMRI rate $R_{\rm
emri}\sim 0-10^{-4} \rm yr^{-1}$ per AGN assuming a SF efficiency
$\epsilon=1-30\%$. In cases where EMRIs occur, this implies a volumetric rate
up to $0.5-10 \rm yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}$ in the local Universe. The rates are
particularly sensitive to model parameters for $M_{\rm BH}=10^6 \rm M_{\odot}$,
for which EMRIs only occur if stars can accrete to $10$s of solar masses. Our
results provide further evidence that gas-embedded EMRIs can contribute a
substantial fraction of events detectable by milliHz gravitational wave
detectors such as LISA. Our disc solutions suggest the presence of migration
traps, as has been found for more massive SMBH discs. Finally, the surviving
population of stars after the disc lifetime leaves implications for stellar

hardly contributes to the observed negative g- factor value, corroborating
molecular $\alpha$-cluster models. The addition of a further neutron, however,
restores the original $\alpha$-cluster g-factors, except for the semi-magic
isotopes, in which the deviations from $g \approx + 0.5$ can be associated with
the relevant shell closures. Secondly, we analyze the same observable in the
framework of a macroscopic $\alpha$-cluster model on a finite lattice of side
length $L$. We focus on the discretization effects induced in the magnetic
dipole moments of the $2_1^+$ and the $3_1^-$ states of ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at
different values of the lattice spacing $a$.

Earth-strength magnetic fields is supposedly the light-induced formation of a
long-lived, magnetically sensitive radical pair inside a cryptochrome
flavoprotein located in the retina of these birds. Blue light absorption by a
flavin chromophore triggers a series of sequential electron transfer steps
across a tetradic tryptophan chain towards the flavin acceptor. The recent
ability to express cryptochrome 4 from the night-migratory European robin

the role of each of the tryptophan residues in the electron transfer chain.
Here, we compare ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of wild type
ErCry4 and four of its mutants having phenylalanine residues in different

tryptophan residues in the chain adds a distinct relaxation component (time
constants 0.5, 30 and 150 ps) to the transient absorption data. The dynamics in
the mutant with a terminal phenylalanine residue are very similar to those in
wild type ErCry4, excepted for a reduced concentration of long-lived radical
pairs. The experimental results are evaluated and discussed in connection with
Marcus-Hopfield theory, providing a complete microscopic insight into the
sequential electron transfers across the tryptophan chain. Our results offer a

matches that derived from quantum oscillations, suggesting it is reflective of

characterized by an unusually large and non-monotonic temperature evolution. We
find this can be quantitatively explained using a semiclassical model based on

thermoelectric coefficients in magnetic field. We show this can be captured by
the Zeeman energy associated with a large effective $g$-factor of 25.8

are derived using MDI-like algorithm and center-of-gravity method. These data
are then filtered to keep only acoustic modes, and phase shifts are calculated
between Doppler velocities of different atmospheric heights as a function of
acoustic frequency. The analysis of the frequency- and height-dependent phase
shifts shows that for evanescent acoustic waves, oscillations in the higher
atmosphere lead those in the lower atmosphere by an order of 1 s when their
frequencies are below about 3.0 mHz, and lags behind by about 1 s when their
frequencies are above 3.0 mHz. Non-negligible phase shifts are also found in
areas with systematic upward or downward flows. All these frequency-dependent

however the IMF peak is predominantly set by protostellar jet physics. We find
the effect of stellar winds is minor, and supernovae occur too late}to affect
the IMF or quench star formation. We also investigate the effects of initial
conditions on the IMF. The IMF is insensitive to the initial turbulence, cloud
mass and cloud surface density, even though these parameters significantly
shape the star formation history of the cloud, including the final star
formation efficiency. The characteristic stellar mass depends weakly on
metallicity and the interstellar radiation field. Finally, while turbulent
driving and the level of magnetization strongly influences the star formation
history, they only influence the high-mass slope of the IMF.

different. An unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) consists of a
mode-sensitive and mode-insensitive phase shifters in the two arms. We set the
bias of the phase shifters so that TE0 propagating in the two arms
constructively interfere while this will not be the case for TE1. Hence, we
detect the phase shift applied to TE0 by measuring the variation in the optical

development of statistical methods for detecting exoplanets by astronomers,

to investigate the properties of such methods. Many of these methods (both
transit- and radial velocity-based) have not been discussed by statisticians

detect a planet by determining whether observations of a star contain a
periodic component. These methods tend to be overly rudimentary for starlight
data and lack robustness to model misspecification. Conversely, radial velocity
methods aim to detect planets by estimating the Doppler shift induced by an
orbiting companion on the spectrum of a star. Many such methods are unable to
detect Doppler shifts on the order of magnitude consistent with Earth-sized
planets around Sun-like stars. Modern radial velocity approaches attempt to
address this deficiency by adapting tools from contemporary statistical
research in functional data analysis, but more work is needed to develop the
statistical theory supporting the use of these models, to expand these models
for multiplanet systems, and to develop methods for detecting ever smaller
Doppler shifts in the presence of stellar activity.

neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis remain an unsettled question.
Observations of kilonovae following gravitational wave-detected neutron star
mergers established mergers as one site of the r-process, but additional
sources may be needed to fully explain r-process enrichment in the Universe.
One intriguing possibility is that rapidly rotating massive stars undergoing
core collapse launch r-process-rich outflows off the accretion disks formed
from their infalling matter. In this scenario, r-process winds comprise one
component of the supernova (SN) ejecta produced by ""collapsar"" explosions. We
present the first systematic study of the effects of r-process enrichment on
the emission from collapsar-generated SNe. We semi-analytically model r-process
SN emission from explosion out to late times, and determine its distinguishing
features. The ease with which r-process SNe can be identified depends on how
effectively wind material mixes into the initially r-process-free outer layers
of the ejecta. In many cases, enrichment produces a near infrared (NIR) excess
that can be detected within ~75 days of explosion. We also discuss optimal
targets and observing strategies for testing the r-process collapsar theory,
and find that frequent monitoring of optical and NIR emission from
high-velocity SNe in the first few months after explosion offers a reasonable
chance of success while respecting finite observing resources. Such early
identification of r-process collapsar candidates also lays the foundation for
nebular-phase spectroscopic follow-up in the near- and mid-infrared, for
example with the James Webb Space Telescope.

emission at the 21 cm wavelength toward the Galactic plane using the
observations in the HI4PI survey. Using the Hessian matrix method across radial
velocity channels, we identified the filamentary structures and quantified
their orientations using circular statistics. We found that the regions of the
Milky Way's disk beyond 10 kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic
center display HI filamentary structures predominantly parallel to the Galactic
plane. For regions at lower Galactocentric radii, we found that the HI
filaments are mostly perpendicular or do not have a preferred orientation with
respect to the Galactic plane. We interpret these results as the imprint of
supernova feedback in the inner Galaxy and Galactic rotation in the outer Milky
Way. We found that the HI filamentary structures follow the Galactic warp and
that they highlight some of the variations interpreted as the effect of the
gravitational interaction with satellite galaxies. In addition, the mean scale
height of the filamentary structures is lower than that sampled by the bulk of
the HI emission, thus indicating that the cold and warm atomic hydrogen phases
have different scale heights in the outer galaxy. Finally, we found that the
fraction of the column density in HI filaments is almost constant up to
approximately 18 kpc from the Galactic center. This is possibly a result of the
roughly constant ratio between the cold and warm atomic hydrogen phases
inferred from the HI absorption studies. Our results indicate that the HI
filamentary structures provide insight into the dynamical processes shaping the
Galactic disk. Their orientations record how and where the stellar energy
input, the Galactic fountain process, the cosmic ray diffusion, and the gas
accretion have molded the diffuse interstellar medium in the Galactic plane.

approaches to analyse quantum data. All these topics are discussed and properly

proposed for the optimal operation of a stand-alone integrated energy system
(IES). Time-scale multiplicity exists in IESs dynamics is taken into account
and addressed using multi-time-scale decomposition. The entire IES is
decomposed into three reduced-order subsystems with slow, medium, and fast
dynamics. Subsequently, the CEMPC, which includes slow economic model
predictive control (EMPC), medium EMPC and fast EMPC, is developed. The EMPCs
communicate with each other to ensure consistency in decision-making. In the
slow EMPC, the global control objectives are optimized, and the manipulated
inputs explicitly affecting the slow dynamics are applied. The medium EMPC
optimizes the control objectives correlated with the medium dynamics and
applies the corresponding optimal medium inputs to the IES, while the fast EMPC
optimizes the fast dynamics relevant objectives and makes a decision on the
manipulated inputs directly associated with the fast dynamics. Meanwhile,
thermal comfort is integrated into the CEMPC in the form of zone tracking of
the building temperature for achieving more control degrees of freedom to
prioritize satisfying the electric demand and reducing operating costs of the
IES. Moreover, a long-term EMPC based on a simplified slow subsystem model is
developed and incorporated into the CEMPC to ensure that the operating state
accommodates long-term forecasts for external conditions. Finally, the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated via
simulations and a comparison with a hierarchical real-time optimization
mechanism.

interpret due to their black box nature. To overcome this, various post-hoc
attribution methods have been proposed to identify image regions most
influential to the models' decisions. Evaluating such methods is challenging
since no ground truth attributions exist. We thus propose three novel
evaluation schemes to more reliably measure the faithfulness of those methods,
to make comparisons between them more fair, and to make visual inspection more
systematic. To address faithfulness, we propose a novel evaluation setting
(DiFull) in which we carefully control which parts of the input can influence
the output in order to distinguish possible from impossible attributions. To
address fairness, we note that different methods are applied at different
layers, which skews any comparison, and so evaluate all methods on the same
layers (ML-Att) and discuss how this impacts their performance on quantitative
metrics. For more systematic visualizations, we propose a scheme (AggAtt) to
qualitatively evaluate the methods on complete datasets. We use these
evaluation schemes to study strengths and shortcomings of some widely used
attribution methods. Finally, we propose a post-processing smoothing step that
significantly improves the performance of some attribution methods, and discuss
its applicability.

increases by cell growth, populations of motile bacteria transition to a glassy

steps, the first one suppressing only the orientational freedom of bacteria,
and the second one vitrifying the bacteria completely. We also characterize
individual motion of bacteria, and find spontaneous formation of micro-domains
of aligned cells. This leads to collective motion, which results in unusual

(KNN) algorithm to estimate the competence of classifiers in a small region
surrounding the query sample. However, KNN is very sensitive to the local
distribution of the data. Moreover, it also has a high computational cost as it
requires storing the whole data in memory and performing multiple distance
calculations during inference. Hence, the dependency on the KNN algorithm ends
up limiting the use of DES techniques for large-scale problems. This paper
presents a new DES framework based on fuzzy hyperboxes called FH-DES. Each
hyperbox can represent a group of samples using only two data points (Min and
Max corners). Thus, the hyperbox-based system will have less computational
complexity than other dynamic selection methods. In addition, despite the
KNN-based approaches, the fuzzy hyperbox is not sensitive to the local data
distribution. Therefore, the local distribution of the samples does not affect
the system's performance. Furthermore, in this research, for the first time,
misclassified samples are used to estimate the competence of the classifiers,
which has not been observed in previous fusion approaches. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method has high classification accuracy while
having a lower complexity when compared with the state-of-the-art dynamic
selection methods. The implemented code is available at

on the interrogation of atoms contained in a cell whose inner content has to
meet high standards of purity and accuracy. Glass-blowing techniques and
craftsmanship have evolved over many decades to achieve such standards in
macroscopic vapor cells. With the emergence of chip-scale atomic devices, the
need for miniaturization and mass fabrication has led to the adoption of
microfabrication techniques to make millimeter-scale vapor cells. However, many
shortcomings remain and no process has been able to match the quality and
versatility of glass-blown cells. Here, we introduce a novel approach to
structure, fill and seal microfabricated vapor cells inspired from the
century-old approach of glass-blowing. In particular we demonstrate opening and
closing single-use zero-leak microfabricated valves, actuated exclusively by
laser, and operating in the same way as the ""make-seals"" and ""break-seals""
found in the filling apparatus of traditional cells. Such structures are
employed to fill cesium vapor cells at the wafer-level. The make-seal structure
consists of a glass membrane that can be locally heated and deflected to seal a
microchannel. The break-seal is obtained by breaching a silicon wall between
cavities. This new approach allows adapting processes previously restricted to
glass-blown cells. It can also be extended to vacuum microelectronics and
vacuum-packaging of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices.

the estimated uncertainty on the PDFs originates from the choices of parametric
functional forms and fitting methodology. We argue that these types of
uncertainties can be underestimated with common PDF ensembles in high-stake
measurements at the Large Hadron Collider and Tevatron. A fruitful approach to
quantify these uncertainties is to view them as arising from sampling of
allowed PDF solutions in a multidimensional parametric space. This approach
applies powerful insights gained in recent statistical studies of large-scale
population surveys and quasi-Monte Carlo integration methods. In particular,
PDF fits may be affected by the big data paradox, which stipulates that more
experimental data do not automatically raise the accuracy of PDFs -- close
attention to the data quality and sampling of possible PDF solutions is as
essential. To test if the sampling of the PDF uncertainty of an experimental
observable is truly representative of all acceptable solutions, we introduce a
technique (``a hopscotch scan'') based on a combination of parameter scans and
stochastic sampling. With this technique, we show that the PDF uncertainty on
key LHC cross sections at 13 TeV obtained with the public NNPDF4.0 fitting code
is larger than the nominal uncertainty obtained with the published NNPDF4.0
Monte-Carlo replica sets, when accounting for the likelihood distribution. On
the same grounds, the uncertainties on the charm distribution at a large
momentum fraction $x$ and gluon PDF at small $x$ are enlarged. In PDF ensembles
obtained in the analytic minimization (Hessian) formalism, the tolerance on the
PDF uncertainty must be based on sufficiently complete sampling of PDF
functional forms and choices of the experiments.

e.g., the numbers of new patients of different types of infectious diseases
from different cities/counties/states repeatedly over time, say,
daily/weekly/monthly. For this type of count data, one important task is the
quick detection and localization of hot-spots in terms of unusual infectious
rates so that we can respond appropriately. In this paper, we develop a method
called Poisson assisted Smooth Sparse Tensor Decomposition (PoSSTenD), which
not only detects when hot-spots occur but also localizes where hot-spots occur.
The main idea of our proposed PoSSTenD method is articulated as follows. First,
we represent the observed count data as a three-dimensional tensor including
(1) a spatial dimension for location patterns, e.g., different
cities/countries/states; (2) a temporal domain for time patterns, e.g.,
daily/weekly/monthly; (3) a categorical dimension for different types of data
sources, e.g., different types of diseases. Second, we fit this tensor into a
Poisson regression model, and then we further decompose the infectious rate
into two components: smooth global trend and local hot-spots. Third, we detect
when hot-spots occur by building a cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart and
localize where hot-spots occur by their LASSO-type sparse estimation. The
usefulness of our proposed methodology is validated through numerical
simulation studies and a real-world dataset, which records the annual number of
10 different infectious diseases from 1993 to 2018 for 49 mainland states in
the United States.

In AMP, the signal of interest is assumed to follow certain prior distribution
with unknown parameters. Previous works focused on finding the parameters that
maximize the measurement likelihood via expectation maximization -- an
increasingly difficult problem to solve in cases involving complicated
probability models. In this paper, we treat the parameters as unknown variables
and compute their posteriors via AMP. The parameters and signal of interest can
then be jointly recovered. Compared to previous methods, the proposed approach
leads to a simple and elegant parameter estimation scheme, allowing us to
directly work with 1-bit quantization noise model. We then further extend our
approach to general multi-bit quantization noise model. Experimental results

so-called selective and efficient quantum process tomography (SEQPT) allows
estimating, individually and up to the required accuracy, a given element of
the matrix that describes such an operation with a polynomial amount of
resources. The implementation of this protocol has been carried out with
success to characterize the evolution of a quantum system that is well
described by a trace preserving quantum map. Here, we deal with a more general
type of quantum process that does not preserve the trace of the input quantum
state, which naturally arises in the presence of imperfect devices and
system-environment interactions, in the context of quantum information science
or quantum dynamics control. In that case, we show that with the aid of {\it a
priori} information on the losses structure of the quantum channel, the SEQPT
reconstruction can be adapted to reconstruct the non-trace-preserving map. We
explicitly describe how to implement the reconstruction in an arbitrary Hilbert
space of finite dimension $d$. The method is experimentally verified on a
superconducting quantum processor of the IBM Quantum services, by estimating
several non trace-preserving quantum processes in dimensions up to $d=6$. Our
results show that it is possible to efficiently reconstruct non
trace-preserving processes, with high precision, and with significantly higher
fidelity than when the process is assumed to be trace-preserving.

computationally expensive to train them. A myriad of architectures and training
strategies have been proposed to overcome this challenge and address several
problems in image processing such as speech, image and action recognition as
well as object detection. In this article, we propose a novel Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) based training for ConvNets. In such framework, the vector
of weights of each ConvNet is typically cast as the position of a particle in
phase space whereby PSO collaborative dynamics intertwines with Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) in order to boost training performance and

is trained independently via SGD; ii) [collaborative phase] ConvNets share
among themselves their current vector of weights (or particle-position) along
with their gradient estimates of the Loss function. Distinct step sizes are
coined by distinct ConvNets. By properly blending ConvNets with large (possibly
random) step-sizes along with more conservative ones, we propose an algorithm
with competitive performance with respect to other PSO-based approaches on
Cifar-10 (accuracy of 98.31%). These accuracy levels are obtained by resorting

malignant tumor and a stop sign as a speed limit sign. The trade-off between
robustness and standard accuracy is common for DNN models. In this paper, we
introduce sensible adversarial learning and demonstrate the synergistic effect
between pursuits of standard natural accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we
define a sensible adversary which is useful for learning a robust model while
keeping high natural accuracy. We theoretically establish that the Bayes
classifier is the most robust multi-class classifier with the 0-1 loss under
sensible adversarial learning. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm that
trains a robust model using implicit loss truncation. We apply sensible
adversarial learning for large-scale image classification to a handwritten

properly treats the multitude of uncertainties in planning. The SRO model
coordinates hardening and system operational measures for smart power

To capture the uncertainty in the incurred damage by extreme events, an
uncertainty set is developed by integrating probabilistic information of
hurricanes with the performance of overhead structures. A novel probabilistic
model for the repair time of damaged lines is derived to account for the
uncertainty in the recovery process. A solution strategy based on the
integration of a differential evolution algorithm and a mixed-integer solver is
designed to solve the resilience maximization model. The proposed approach is
applied to a modified IEEE 33-bus system with 485 utility poles and a 118-bus

properties of a wavefunction in simulation. One type of virtual detector
measures the probability density and current at a set position over time,
permitting an instantaneous measurement of momentum at a boundary. This may be
used as the boundary condition between a quantum and a classical simulation.
However, as a tool for measuring spectra, it possesses several problems
stemming from its incoherent nature. Another form of virtual detector measures
the wavefunction's complex value at a set position in real space over time and
Fourier analyzes it to produce an energy spectrum. The spectra it produces are
exact provided that the wavefunction propagated through the detector in one
direction. Otherwise it will produce a spectrum that includes interference
between forward and backward propagating wavepackets. Here we propose a virtual
detector which maintains all the benefits of this coherent virtual detector
while also being able to resolve the direction of propagation and mitigate

batteries but are prone to structural instabilities and oxygen loss via the
formation of singlet oxygen. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we
observe spontaneous O$_2$ loss from the (012) surface of delithiated LiNiO$_2$,
singlet oxygen forming in the process. We find that the origin of the
instability lies in the pronounced oxidation of O during delithiation, i.e., O
plays a central role in Ni O redox in LiNiO$_2$. For LiNiO$_2$, NiO$_2$, and
the prototype rock salt NiO, density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field
theory calculations based on maximally localised Wannier functions yield a Ni
charge state of ca. +2, with O varying between -2 (NiO), -1.5 (LiNiO$_2$) and
-1 (NiO$_2$). Predicted XAS Ni $K$ and O $K$-edge spectra are in excellent
agreement with experimental XAS spectra, confirming the predicted charge
states. The calculations also show that a high-voltage O $K$-edge feature at
531 eV previously assigned to lattice O-redox processes could alternatively
arise from O-redox induced water intercalation and O-O dimer formation with
lattice O at high states of charge. The O$_2$ surface loss route observed here
consists of 2 surface O$^{.-}$ radicals combining to form a peroxide ion, which
is oxidised to O$_2$, leaving behind 2 O vacancies and 2 O$^{2-}$ ions:
effectively 4 O$^{.-}$ radicals disproportionate to O$_2$ and 2 O$^{2-}$ ions.
The reaction liberates ca. 3 eV per O$_2$ molecule. Singlet oxygen formation is
caused by the singlet ground state of the peroxide ion, with spin conservation
dictating the preferential release of $^1$O$_2$, the strongly exergonic
reaction providing the free energy required for the formation of $^1$O$_2$ in
its excited state.

patterns. Lenia can be viewed as a continuously-valued generalization of the
Game of Life, a seminal cellular automaton developed by John Conway that
exhibits complex and universal behavior based on simple birth and survival
rules. Life's framework of totalistic CA based on the Moore neighborhood
includes many other interesting, Life-like, CA. A simplification introduced in
Lenia limits the types of Life-like CA that are expressible in Lenia to a
specific subset. This work recovers the ability to easily implement any
Life-like CA by splitting Lenia's growth function into genesis and persistence
functions, analogous to Life's birth and survival rules. We demonstrate the
capabilities of this new CA variant by implementing a puffer pattern from
Life-like CA Morley/Move, and examine differences between related CA in Lenia
and Glaberish frameworks: Hydrogeminium natans and s613, respectively. These CA
exhibit marked differences in dynamics and character based on spatial entropy
over time, and both support several persistent mobile patterns. The CA s613,
implemented in the Glaberish framework, is more dynamic than the Hydrogeminium
CA in terms of a consistently high variance in spatial entropy over time. These
results suggest there may be a wide variety of interesting CA that can be
implemented in the Glaberish variant of the Lenia framework, analogous to the
many interesting Life-like CA outside of Conway's Life.

the largest bias for which a given approach improves over using the unbiased
estimator alone. Though this lens, we review several recent proposals, and
observe in simulation that different approaches exhibits qualitatively
different behavior.
  We also introduce a simple alternative approach, which compares favorably in
simulation to recent alternatives, having a higher bias threshold and generally
making a more conservative trade-off between best-case performance (when the

significant effects on the bound states. For example, for Dirac delta potential
$g\delta(x)$, there exists one bound state for both positive and negative
potential strength $g$. Furthermore, when the potential is weak, the bound
state energy is proportional to the potential strength $g$. For square well
potential, the flat band results in the existence of infinite bound states for
arbitrarily weak potential. In addition, when the bound state energy is very

bound state energies are inversely proportional to the square of natural number
$n$ (e.g., $E_n\propto 1/n^2, n=1,2,3,...$). Most of the above nontrivial
behaviors can be attributed to the infinitely large density of states of flat

promote the affinity matrix construction and augment the initial pairwise

use of regression analysis, either linear or generalized linear models, is

variable at a time. Moreover, it is not possible to directly calculate from the
regression model a correlation measure between the response variables. In this
article, we employed the Multivariate Generalized Linear Mixed Models
framework, which allows the specification of a set of response variables and
calculates the correlation between them through a random effect structure that
follows a multivariate normal distribution. We used the maximum likelihood
estimation framework to estimate all model parameters using Laplace
approximation to integrate out the random effects. The derivatives are provided
by automatic differentiation. The outer maximization was made using a
general-purpose algorithm such as \texttt{PORT} and \texttt{BFGS}. We delimited
this problem by studying only count response variables with the following
distributions: Poisson, negative binomial (NB) and COM-Poisson. The models were
implemented on software \texttt{R} with package \texttt{TMB}. Besides the full
specification, models with simpler structures in the covariance matrix were
considered (fixed and common variance, fixed dispersion, $\rho$ set to 0).
These models were applied to a dataset from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, where three underdispersed response variables were measured
at 1281 subjects. The COM-Poisson model full specified overcome the other two
competitors considering three goodness-of-fit indexes. Therefore, the proposed
model can deal with multivariate count responses and measures the correlation
between them taking into account the effects of the covariates.

perfect and the model is exposed to repeated data at the sentence, paragraph,

effects of this repeated data. In this paper we attempt to study repeated data
systematically and to understand its effects mechanistically. To do this, we
train a family of models where most of the data is unique but a small fraction
of it is repeated many times. We find a strong double descent phenomenon, in
which repeated data can lead test loss to increase midway through training. A
predictable range of repetition frequency leads to surprisingly severe
degradation in performance. For instance, performance of an 800M parameter
model can be degraded to that of a 2x smaller model (400M params) by repeating
0.1% of the data 100 times, despite the other 90% of the training tokens
remaining unique. We suspect there is a range in the middle where the data can
be memorized and doing so consumes a large fraction of the model's capacity,
and this may be where the peak of degradation occurs. Finally, we connect these
observations to recent mechanistic interpretability work - attempting to
reverse engineer the detailed computations performed by the model - by showing
that data repetition disproportionately damages copying and internal structures
associated with generalization, such as induction heads, providing a possible
mechanism for the shift from generalization to memorization. Taken together,
these results provide a hypothesis for why repeating a relatively small
fraction of data in large language models could lead to disproportionately
large harms to performance.

disconnected communities with distinct opinions and a well-connected single

relevance to various current societal issues. We had previously studied this
problem using numerical simulations of adaptive social network models and found
that two individual behavioral traits, homophily and attention to novelty, had
the most statistically significant impact on the outcomes of social network
evolution. However, our previous study was limited in terms of the range of
parameter values examined, and possible interactions between multiple
behavioral traits were largely ignored. In this study, we conducted a
substantially larger-scale parameter sweep numerical experiment of the same
model with expanded parameter ranges by an order of magnitude in each parameter
dimension, resulting in a total of 116,640 simulation runs. To capture
nontrivial interactions among behavioral parameters, we modeled and visualized
the dependence of outcome measures on the model parameters using artificial
neural networks. Results show that, while the competition between homophily and
attention to novelty is still the primary determinant of social fragmentation,
another transition plane emerges when individuals have strong social conformity
behavior, which was not previously known. This implies that social
fragmentation transition can also occur in the homophily-social conformity
trade-off, the two behavioral traits that have very similar microscopic
individual-level effects but produce very different macroscopic
collective-level outcomes, illustrating the nontrivial macroscopic dynamics of
complex collective systems.

transfer, improving charging efficiency remains as a major challenge for DWC
systems. This paper presents the first LSTM-based vehicle motion control system
for DWC designed to maximize charging efficiency. The dynamics of the
electromagnetic field generated by the transmitter coils of a DWC system are
modeled based on a multi-layer LSTM. The LSTM model is used to make a
prediction of the lateral position where the electromagnetic strength is
expected to be maximal and to control the EV motion accordingly to optimize
charging efficiency. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate that our
LSTM-based approach achieves by up to 162.3% higher charging efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art vehicle motion control systems focused on
keeping an EV in the center of lane.

formation channels, in part because most of these channels are difficult to

supermassive star, has several possible probes including the explosion of a
helium-core supermassive star triggered by a general relativistic instability.
We develop a straightforward method for evaluating the general relativistic
radial instability without simplifying assumptions and apply it to population
III supermassive stars taken from a post Newtonian stellar evolution code. This
method is more accurate than previous determinations and it finds that the
instability occurs earlier in the evolutionary life of the star. Using the
results of the stability analysis, we perform 1D general relativistic
hydrodynamical simulations and we find two general relativistic instability
supernovae fueled by alpha capture reactions as well as several lower mass
pulsations, analogous to the puslational pair instability process. The mass
range for the events (2.6-3.0 $\times 10^4$ ${\rm M}_\odot$) is lower than had
been suggested by previous works (5.5 $\times 10^4$ ${\rm M}_\odot$) because
the instability occurs earlier in the star's evolution. The explosion may be
visible to, among others, JWST, while the discovery of the pulsations opens up
additional possibilities for observation.

terms of distortion types as well as in making non-uniform comparisons of

current VQA models require compared videos to be of the same frame rate, but
are unable to adequately account for frame rate artifacts. The recently
proposed Generalized Entropic Difference (GREED) VQA model succeeds at this

fusion framework, whereby temporal features from GREED are combined with
existing VQA models, towards improving model sensitivity towards frame rate
distortions. We find through extensive experiments that this feature fusion
significantly boosts model performance on both HFR/VFR datasets as well as

field of the accretion disk. The accretion disk consists of an inner compact
corona and an outer sub-Keplerian disk. The thermodynamics of the fluid is
governed by a relativistic equation of state (EoS) for multispecies fluid which
enables to study the effect of composition on jet-dynamics. Jets originate from
the vicinity of the central black hole where the effect of gravity is
significant and traverses large distances where only special relativistic
treatment is sufficient. So we have modified the flat metric to include the
effect of gravity. In this modified relativistic framework we have developed a
new total variation diminishing (TVD) routine along with multispecies EoS for
the purpose. We show that the acceleration of jets crucially depends on flow
composition. All the results presented are transonic in nature, starting from
very low injection velocities, the jets can achieve high Lorentz factors. For
sub-Eddington luminosities, lepton dominated jets can be accelerated to Lorentz
factors > 50. The change in radiation field due to variation in the accretion
disk dynamics will be propagated to the jet in a finite amount of time. Hence
any change in radiation field due to a change in disk configuration will affect
the lower part of the jet before it affects the outer part. This can drive
shock transition in the jet flow. Depending upon the disk oscillation
frequency, amplitude and jet parameters these shocks can collide with each
other and may trigger shock cascades.

AI safety research. Yet claims regarding AGI must rely upon mathematical
formalisms -- theoretical agents we may analyse or attempt to build. AIXI
appears to be the only such formalism supported by proof that its behaviour is
optimal, a consequence of its use of compression as a proxy for intelligence.
Unfortunately, AIXI is incomputable and claims regarding its behaviour highly
subjective. We argue that this is because AIXI formalises cognition as taking
place in isolation from the environment in which goals are pursued (Cartesian
dualism). We propose an alternative, supported by proof and experiment, which
overcomes these problems. Integrating research from cognitive science with AI,
we formalise an enactive model of learning and reasoning to address the problem
of subjectivity. This allows us to formulate a different proxy for
intelligence, called weakness, which addresses the problem of incomputability.
We prove optimal behaviour is attained when weakness is maximised. This proof
is supplemented by experimental results comparing weakness and description
length (the closest analogue to compression possible without reintroducing
subjectivity). Weakness outperforms description length, suggesting it is a
better proxy. Furthermore we show that, if cognition is enactive, then
minimisation of description length is neither necessary nor sufficient to
attain optimal performance, undermining the notion that compression is closely
related to intelligence. However, there remain open questions regarding the
implementation of scale-able AGI. In the short term, these results may be best
utilised to improve the performance of existing systems. For example, our
results explain why Deepmind's Apperception Engine is able to generalise
effectively, and how to replicate that performance by maximising weakness.

exact MMS fairness cannot be guaranteed, and so far the best-known
approximation for additive cost functions is $\frac{13}{11}$ by Huang and
Segal-Halevi [EC, 2023]; however, beyond additivity, very little is known. In
this work, we first prove that no algorithm can ensure better than
$\min\{n,\frac{\log m}{\log \log m}\}$-approximation if the cost functions are
submodular. This result also shows a sharp contrast with the allocation of
goods where constant approximations exist as shown by Barman and Krishnamurthy

tight. Besides multiplicative approximation, we also consider the ordinal

becomes a complex number, where the real and imaginary parts respectively
correspond to an oscillation frequency and damping rate, one has to somehow
solve the eigenvalue problem concerning the eigenvalue in two-dimensional
parameter space. To avoid this bother, one sometimes adopts an approximation,
where the eigenvalue is in one-dimensional parameter space. In this study,
first, we show the accuracy of the zero-damping approximation, which is one of
the one-dimensional approximations, for the fundamental and 1st pressure modes.
But, this approximation is not applicable to the spacetime mode, because the
damping rate of the spacetime mode is generally comparable to the oscillation
frequency. Nevertheless, we find the empirical relation for the ratio of the
imaginary part to the real part of the eigenfrequency, which is expressed as a
function of the steller compactness almost independently of the adopted
equations of state for neutron star matter. Adopting this empirical relation,
one can express the eigenfrequency in terms of just the real part, i.e., the
problem to solve becomes an eigenvalue problem with a one-dimensional
eigenvalue. Then, we find that the frequencies are estimated with good accuracy

density models for which the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE for short) does
not exist. We mainly illustrate the properties of our estimator on models of
densities on the line that satisfy a shape constraint. We show that it
possesses some similar optimality properties, with regard to some global rates
of convergence, as the MLE does when it exists. It also enjoys some adaptation
properties with respect to some specific target densities in the model for
which our estimator is proven to converge at parametric rate. More important is
the fact that our estimator is robust, not only with respect to model
misspecification, but also to contamination, the presence of outliers among the
dataset and the equidistribution assumption. This means that the estimator
performs almost as well as if the data were i.i.d. with density $p$ in a
situation where these data are only independent and most of their marginals are
close enough in total variation to a distribution with density $p$. We also
show that our estimator converges to the average density of the data, when this
density belongs to the model, even when none of the marginal densities belongs
to it. Our main result on the risk of the estimator takes the form of an
exponential deviation inequality which is non-asymptotic and involves explicit

describes an experiment to be performed at a BNL-proposed CLIP project which is
to be capable of producing intense polarized beams of protons, $p$, helions

  The EDM prototype ring PTR (proposed at COSY Lab, Juelich) is expected to
measure individual particle EDMs (for example ${\rm EDM\_p}$ for the proton)
using simultaneous counter-rotating polarized proton beams, with statistical
error $\pm10^{-30}$e.cm after one year running time, four orders of magnitude
less than the PSI neutron EDM upper limit, and with comparable systematic
error.
  A composite particle, the helion faces T-symmetry constraints more
challenging than the proton. Any measurably large value of $$\Delta={\rm
EDM}_h-{\rm EDM}_p,$$ the difference of helion and proton EDMs, would represent
BSM physics.
  The plan is to replicate PTR at BNL. The dominant systematic error would be
canceled two ways, both made possible by phase-locking ""doubly-magic"" 38.6\,MeV
proton and 39.2\,MeV helion spin tunes. This stabilizes their MDM-induced
in-plane precessions, without affecting their EDM-induced out-of-plane
precessions. The dominant systematic error would therefore cancel in the
meaurement of $\Delta$ in a fixed field configuration.
  Another systematic error cancellation will come from averaging runs for which
both magnetic field and beam circulation directions are reversed. Precise
magnetic field reversal is made possible by the reproducible absolute frequency
phase-locking over long runs to eliminate the need for (impractically precise)
magnetic field measurement. Risk of EDM measurement failure is discussed in a
final appendix.

visual classification task. Most of the existing methods focus on developing
attention or augmentation mechanisms to achieve this goal. However, addressing
the ambiguity in the top-k prediction classes is not fully investigated. In
this paper, we introduce a Self Assessment Classifier, which simultaneously
leverages the representation of the image and top-k prediction classes to
reassess the classification results. Our method is inspired by continual
learning with coarse-grained and fine-grained classifiers to increase the
discrimination of features in the backbone and produce attention maps of
informative areas on the image. In practice, our method works as an auxiliary
branch and can be easily integrated into different architectures. We show that
by effectively addressing the ambiguity in the top-k prediction classes, our
method achieves new state-of-the-art results on CUB200-2011, Stanford Dog, and
FGVC Aircraft datasets. Furthermore, our method also consistently improves the
accuracy of different existing fine-grained classifiers with a unified setup.

sources and usually associated with flares. In this paper, by performing and
analyzing three dimensional general relativity magnetohydrodynamical numerical
simulations of accretion flows, we investigate their physical mechanisms. We
find that magnetic reconnection occurs in the accretion flow, likely due to the
turbulent motion and differential rotation of the accretion flow, resulting in
flares and formation of flux ropes. Flux ropes formed inside of 10-15
gravitational radii are found to mainly stay within the accretion flow, while
flux ropes formed beyond this radius are ejected outward by magnetic forces and
form the episodic jets. These results confirm the basic scenario proposed in
Yuan et al.(2009). Moreover, our simulations find that the predicted velocity
of the ejected blobs is in good consistency with observations of Sgr A*, M81,
and M87. The whole processes are found to occur quasi-periodically, with the
period being the orbital time at the radius where the flux rope is formed. The
predicted period of flares and ejections is consistent with those found from
the light curves or image of Sgr A*, M87, and PKS 1510-089. The possible
applications to protostellar accretion systems are discussed.

long-term stability of the metal halide perovskite (MHP) light absorbing layer.
Solution processing, the common fabrication method for MHPs, produces
polycrystalline films with a wide variety of defects, such as point defects,
surfaces, and grain boundaries. Although the optoelectronic effects of such
defects have been widely studied, the evaluation of their impact on the
long-term stability remains challenging. In particular, an understanding of the
dynamics of degradation reactions at the atomistic scale is lacking. In this
work, using reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we
investigate the effects of defects, in the forms of surfaces, surface defects
and grain boundaries, on the stability of the inorganic halide perovskite
CsPbI$_{3}$. Our simulations establish a stability trend for a variety of
surfaces, which correlates well with the occurrence of these surfaces in
experiments. We find that a perovskite surface degrades by progressively
changing the local geometry of PbI$_{\mathrm{x}}$ octahedra from corner- to
edge- to face-sharing. Importantly, we find that Pb dangling bonds and the lack
of steric hindrance of I species are two crucial factors that induce
degradation reactions. Finally, we show that the stability of these surfaces
can be modulated by adjusting their atomistic details, either by creating
additional point defects or merging them to form grain boundaries. While in
general additional defects, particularly when clustered, have a negative impact
on the material stability, some grain boundaries have a stabilizing effect,
primarily because of the additional steric hindrance.

  Modeling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper explores improvements to the masked image modeling (MIM) paradigm.
The MIM paradigm enables the model to learn the main object features of the
image by masking the input image and predicting the masked part by the unmasked
part. We found the following three main directions for MIM to be improved.
First, since both encoders and decoders contribute to representation learning,
MIM uses only encoders for downstream tasks, which ignores the impact of
decoders on representation learning. Although the MIM paradigm already employs
small decoders with asymmetric structures, we believe that continued reduction
of decoder parameters is beneficial to improve the representational learning
capability of the encoder . Second, MIM solves the image prediction task by
training the encoder and decoder together , and does not design a separate task
for the encoder . To further enhance the performance of the encoder when
performing downstream tasks, we designed the encoder for the tasks of
comparative learning and token position prediction. Third, since the input
image may contain background and other objects, and the proportion of each
object in the image varies, reconstructing the tokens related to the background
or to other objects is not meaningful for MIM to understand the main object
representations. Therefore we use ContrastiveCrop to crop the input image so
that the input image contains as much as possible only the main objects. Based
on the above three improvements to MIM, we propose a new model, Contrastive
Masked AutoEncoders (CMAE). We achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 65.84% on
tinyimagenet using the ViT-B backbone, which is +2.89 outperforming the MAE of
competing methods when all conditions are equal. Code will be made available.

(LGE) cardiac MR (CMR) images is difficult due to the intensity heterogeneity
arising from accumulation of contrast agent in infarcted myocardium. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive framework for automatic 3D segmentation of
the LV in LGE CMR images. Given myocardial contours in cine images as a priori
knowledge, the framework initially propagates the a priori segmentation from
cine to LGE images via 2D translational registration. Two meshes representing
respectively endocardial and epicardial surfaces are then constructed with the
propagated contours. After construction, the two meshes are deformed towards
the myocardial edge points detected in both short-axis and long-axis LGE images
in a unified 3D coordinate system. Taking into account the intensity
characteristics of the LV in LGE images, we propose a novel parametric model of
the LV for consistent myocardial edge points detection regardless of
pathological status of the myocardium (infarcted or healthy) and of the type of
the LGE images (short-axis or long-axis). We have evaluated the proposed
framework with 21 sets of real patient and 4 sets of simulated phantom data.
Both distance- and region-based performance metrics confirm the observation
that the framework can generate accurate and reliable results for myocardial
segmentation of LGE images. We have also tested the robustness of the framework
with respect to varied a priori segmentation in both practical and simulated
settings. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can greatly
compensate variations in the given a priori knowledge and consistently produce
accurate segmentations.

systems hosts a hot Jupiter, except for HAT-P-26 which hosts a Neptune-mass
planet. Methods: We observed transit events of these planets with the HARPS-N
spectrograph, obtaining high-precision radial velocity measurements that allow
us to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for each of the target systems. We
used these new HARPS-N spectra and archival data, including those from Gaia, to
better characterise the stellar atmospheric parameters. The photometric
parameters for four of the hot Jupiters were recalculated using 17 new transit
light curves, obtained with an array of medium-class telescopes, and data from
the TESS space telescope. HATNet time-series photometric data were checked for
the signatures of rotation periods of the target stars and their spin axis
inclination. Results: From the analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, we
derived a sky-projected obliquity of 13, -26.3, -0.7, -26 degree for HAT-P-15b,
HAT-P-17b, HAT-P-21b and HAT-P-29b, respectively. Due to the quality of the
data, we were not able to well constrain the sky-projected obliquity for
HAT-P-26b, although a prograde orbit is favoured. The stellar activity of
HAT-P-21 indicates a rotation period of 15.88 days, which allowed us to
determine its true misalignment angle (25 degree). Our new analysis of the
physical parameters of the five exoplanetary systems returned values compatible
with those existing in the literature. Using TESS and the available transit
light curves, we reviewed the orbital ephemeris for the five systems and
confirmed that the HAT-P-26 system shows transit timing variations, which may
tentatively be attributed to the presence of a third body.

important problem with various applications in social network analysis and
bioinformatics. This problem is typically solved by using graph neural networks
(GNNs), which yet rely on a large number of labeled graphs for training and are
unable to leverage unlabeled graphs. We address the limitations by proposing
the Kernel-based Graph Neural Network (KGNN). A KGNN consists of a GNN-based
network as well as a kernel-based network parameterized by a memory network.
The GNN-based network performs classification through learning graph
representations to implicitly capture the similarity between query graphs and
labeled graphs, while the kernel-based network uses graph kernels to explicitly
compare each query graph with all the labeled graphs stored in a memory for
prediction. The two networks are motivated from complementary perspectives, and
thus combing them allows KGNN to use labeled graphs more effectively. We
jointly train the two networks by maximizing their agreement on unlabeled
graphs via posterior regularization, so that the unlabeled graphs serve as a
bridge to let both networks mutually enhance each other. Experiments on a range
of well-known benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGNN achieves impressive
performance over competitive baselines.

instantiated with Gaussian distributions and were crucial for arguing the

  We found that the best strategy for a worst-case bound combines Parseval's
Identity, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and the second linear programming
bound, and this holds for both codes and lattices and all noise distributions
at hand. For an average-case analysis, the linear programming bound can be
replaced by a tight average count.
  This alone gives optimal results for spherically uniform noise over random
codes and random lattices. This also improves previous Gaussian smoothing bound
for worst-case lattices, but surprisingly this provides even better results
with uniform ball noise than for Gaussian (or Bernoulli noise for codes).
  This counter-intuitive situation can be resolved by adequate decomposition
and truncation of Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions into a superposition of
uniform noise, giving further improvement for those cases, and putting them on

migration mechanisms, cell properties, or cell-environment interactions. The
complexity of cell dynamics is reflected, e.g., in the diversity of the
observed forms of velocity autocorrelation function -- that has been widely
served as a measure of diffusivity and spreading -- . By analyzing the dynamics
of migrating dendritic cells in vitro, we disentangle the contributions of
direction and speed to the velocity autocorrelation. We find that the ability
of cells to maintain their speed or direction of motion is unequal, reflected
in power-law decays of speed and direction autocorrelation functions with
different exponents. The larger power-law exponent of the speed autocorrelation
function indicates that the cells lose their speed memory considerably faster
than the direction memory. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the
influence of speed and direction memories as well as the direction-speed
cross-correlation on the search time of a persistent random walker to find a
randomly located target in confinement. Although the direction memory and
direction-speed coupling play the major roles, we find that the speed
autocorrelation can be also tuned to minimize the search time. Adopting an
optimal speed memory can reduce the search time even up to 10% compared to
uncorrelated spontaneous speeds. Our results suggest that migrating cells can
improve their search efficiency, especially in crowded environments, through
the directional or speed persistence or the speed-direction correlation.

tackled effectively using the cross-entropy (CE) loss function. However, the
task of dialog generation poses unique challenges for CE loss. This is because
CE loss assumes that, for any given input, the only possible output is the one
available as the ground truth in the training dataset. But, in dialog
generation, there can be multiple valid responses (for a given context) that
not only have different surface forms but can also be semantically different.
Furthermore, CE loss computation for the dialog generation task does not take
the input context into consideration and, hence, it grades the response
irrespective of the context. To grade the generated response for qualities like
relevance, engagingness, etc., the loss function should depend on both the
context and the generated response. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes CORAL, a novel loss function based on a reinforcement learning (RL)
view of the dialog generation task with a reward function that estimates human
preference for generated responses while considering both the context and the
response. Furthermore, to overcome challenges such as high sample complexity of
RL training and a large action space, we propose a mix-policy training
algorithm. Notably, using CORAL we can train dialog generation models without
assuming the ground-truth as the only correct response. Extensive comparisons
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CORAL based models outperform strong
state-of-the-art baseline models of different sizes.

technologies and methods currently in use for indoor localization, the
approaches that rely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) anchors, Received Signal
Strength (RSS), and lateration are among the most popular, mainly because of
their cheap and easy deployment and accessible infrastructure by a variety of
devices. Nevertheless, such BLE- and RSS-based indoor positioning systems are
prone to inaccuracies, mostly due to signal fluctuations, poor quantity of
anchors deployed in the environment, and/or inappropriate anchor distributions,
as well as mobile device hardware variability. In this paper, we address these
issues by using a collaborative indoor positioning approach, which exploits
neighboring devices as additional anchors in an extended positioning network.
The collaborating devices' information (i.e., estimated positions and BLE-RSS)
is processed using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network by taking into
account the device specificity in order to estimate the relative distances.
After this, the lateration is applied to collaboratively estimate the device
position. Finally, the stand-alone and collaborative position estimates are
combined, providing the final position estimate for each device. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed collaborative approach
outperforms the stand-alone lateration method in terms of positioning accuracy.

recently proposed curvature coupling helical magnetogenesis scenario
\cite{Bamba:2021wyx} -- (1) whether the model is consistent with the
predictions of perturbative quantum field theory (QFT), and (2) whether the
curvature perturbation induced by the generated electromagnetic (EM) field
during inflation is consistent with the Planck data. Such requirements are well
motivated in order to argue the viability of the magnetogenesis model under
consideration. Actually, the magnetogenesis scenario proposed in
\cite{Bamba:2021wyx} seems to predict sufficient magnetic strength over the
large scales and also leads to the correct baryon asymmetry of the universe for
a suitable range of the model parameter. However in the realm of inflationary
magnetogenesis, these requirements are not enough to argue the viability of the
model, particularly one needs to examine some more important requirements in
this regard. We may recall that the calculations generally used to determine
the magnetic field's power spectrum are based on the perturbative QFT --
therefore it is important to examine whether the predictions of such
perturbative QFT are consistent with the observational bounds of the model
parameter. On other hand, the generated gauge field acts as a source of the
curvature perturbation which needs to be suppressed compared to that of
contributed from the inflaton field in order to be consistent with the Planck
observation. These set our motivation. Interestingly, both the aforementioned
requirements in the context of the curvature coupling helical magnetogenesis
scenario are found to be simultaneously satisfied by that range of the model
parameter which leads to the correct magnetic strength over the large scale
modes.

specialized circuits, as well as integration across circuits to perform
high-level information processing. One possible way to implement these
seemingly opposing demands is by flexibly switching between synchronous and
less synchronous states. Understanding how complex synchronization patterns are
controlled by the interaction of network architecture and external
perturbations is thus a central challenge in neuroscience, but the mechanisms
behind such interactions remain elusive. Here, we utilise precision
neuroengineering to manipulate cultured neuronal networks and show that a
modular architecture facilitates desynchronization upon asynchronous
stimulation, making external noise a control parameter of synchrony. Using
spiking neuron models, we then demonstrate that external noise can reduce the
level of available synaptic resources, which make intermodular interactions
more stochastic and thereby facilitates the breakdown of synchrony. Finally,
the phenomenology of stochastic intermodular interactions is formulated into a
mesoscopic model that incorporates a state-dependent gating mechanism for
signal propagation. Taken together, our results demonstrate a network mechanism
by which asynchronous inputs tune the inherent dynamical state in structured
networks of excitable units.

relations hold, the weak formulation of the equivalence principle is violated,
since the inertial mass of quantum systems becomes position-dependent whilst
the gravitational mass is left untouched. To obtain the above result, spinor
and scalar fields are separately analyzed by considering the non-relativistic
limit of the Dirac and the Klein-Gordon equations in the presence of the
extended uncertainty principle. In both scenarios, it is found that the ratio
between the inertial and the gravitational mass is the same.

blockchain to force participants to behave well. It integrates gradient
compression and our designed voting mechanism to coordinate decentralized FL
among peer participants without mutual trust, while preventing data from being
reconstructed from transmitted model updates. Extensive experiments conducted
on two real-world datasets exhibit that BlockDFL obtains competitive accuracy
compared to centralized FL and can defend poisoning attacks while achieving

outperforming existing fully decentralized FL frameworks based on blockchain.

tolerant to links failures and links asynchrony. It cares for a class of
networks with specific needs, where both safety and liveness are essential, and
timely irrevocable consensus has priority over highest throughput. The
algorithm operates with redundant delivery of messages via indirect paths of up
to 3 hops, aims all correct processes to obtain a coherent view of the system
state within a bounded time, and establishes consensus with no need of leader.
Consensus involves exchange of 2*n*n*n asymmetrically authenticated messages
and tolerates up to < n/2 faulty processes. We show that in a consensus system
with known members: 1) The existing concepts for delivery over a fraction of
links and gossip-based reliable multicast can be extended to also circumvent
asynchronous links and thereby convert the reliable delivery into a reliable
bounded delivery. 2) A system of synchronous processes with bounded delivery
does not need a leader - all correct processes from connected majority derive
and propose the same consensus value from atomically consistent individual
views on system state. 3) The required for bounded delivery asymmetric
authentication of messages is sufficient for safety of the consensus algorithm.
Key finding: the impossibility of safety and liveness of consensus in partial
synchrony is not valid in the entire space between synchrony and asynchrony. A
system of synchronized synchronous processes, which communicate with
asymmetrically authenticated messages over a medium susceptible to asynchrony
and faults, can operate with: 1) defined tolerance to number of asynchronous
and/or faulty links per number of stop-failed and/or Byzantine processes; 2)
leaderless algorithm with bounded termination; and 3) conceptually ensured
simultaneous safety and bounded liveness.

Accordingly, we engage CE and $L_2$ loss functions to learn from these two

further design a novel similar loss to make the prediction of the model

infarcts within the segmented myocardium. However, automatic segmentation is
difficult usually due to the intensity heterogeneity of the myocardium and
intensity similarity between the infarcts and blood pool. Besides, the slices

Therefore, a dual-task interactive transformer is proposed to detect both

boundary feature is considered as Query to improve the camouflaged object
detection, and meanwhile the object feature is considered as Query to improve
the boundary detection. The camouflaged object detection and the boundary
detection are fully interacted by multi-head self-attention. Besides, to obtain

are adopted to extract the foreground and background. The foreground is just

systematically study whether automated program repair (APR) techniques can fix
the incorrect solutions produced by language models in LeetCode contests. The
goal is to study whether APR techniques can enhance reliability in the code
produced by large language models. Our study revealed that: (1) automatically
generated code shares common programming mistakes with human-crafted solutions,
indicating APR techniques may have potential to fix auto-generated code; (2)
given bug location information provided by a statistical fault localization
approach, the newly released Codex edit mode, which supports editing code, is
similar to or better than existing Java repair tools TBar and Recoder in fixing
incorrect solutions. By analyzing the experimental results generated by these
tools, we provide several suggestions: (1) enhancing APR tools to surpass
limitations in patch space (e.g., introducing more flexible fault localization)
is desirable; (2) as large language models can derive more fix patterns by
training on more data, future APR tools could shift focus from adding more fix
patterns to synthesis/semantics based approaches, (3) combination of language

the process of varying the values of one or more attributes of a face image

this paper, we survey the recent works and advances in semantic facial
attribute editing. We cover all related aspects of these models including the
related definitions and concepts, architectures, loss functions, datasets,

the user-micro-video connection relationship, which is difficult to capture the
more complex relationships between nodes. To address the above problems, we
propose a personalized recommendation model based on graph neural network,
which utilizes the feature that graph neural network can tap deep information
of graph data more effectively, and transforms the input user rating
information and item side information into graph structure, for effective
feature extraction, based on the importance sampling strategy. The
importance-based sampling strategy measures the importance of neighbor nodes to
the central node by calculating the relationship tightness between the neighbor
nodes and the central node, and selects the neighbor nodes for recommendation
tasks based on the importance level, which can be more targeted to select the
sampling neighbors with more influence on the target micro-video nodes. The
pooling aggregation strategy, on the other hand, trains the aggregation weights
by inputting the neighborhood node features into the fully connected layer
before aggregating the neighborhood features, and then introduces the pooling
layer for feature aggregation, and finally aggregates the obtained neighborhood
aggregation features with the target node itself, which directly introduces a
symmetric trainable function to fuse the neighborhood weight training into the
model to better capture the different neighborhood nodes' differential features
in a learnable manner to allow for a more accurate representation of the
current node features.

connectivity limitation remains to be a critical challenge. Both near-term NISQ
quantum computers and relatively long-term scalable quantum architectures do
not offer full connectivity. As a result, quantum circuits may not be directly
executed on quantum hardware, and a quantum compiler needs to perform qubit
routing to make the circuit compatible with the device layout. During the qubit
routing step, the compiler inserts SWAP gates and performs circuit
transformations. Given the connectivity topology of the target hardware, there
are typically multiple qubit routing candidates. The state-of-the-art compilers
use a cost function to evaluate the number of SWAP gates for different routes
and then select the one with the minimum number of SWAP gates. After qubit
routing, the quantum compiler performs gate optimizations upon the circuit with
the newly inserted SWAP gates.
  In this paper, we observe that the aforementioned qubit routing is not
optimal, and qubit routing should \textit{not} be independent on subsequent
gate optimizations. We find that with the consideration of gate optimizations,
not all of the SWAP gates have the same basis-gate cost. These insights lead to
the development of our qubit routing algorithm, NASSC (Not All Swaps have the
Same Cost). NASSC is the first algorithm that considers the subsequent
optimizations during the routing step. Our optimization-aware qubit routing
leads to better routing decisions and benefits subsequent optimizations. We
also propose a new optimization-aware decomposition for the inserted SWAP
gates. Our experiments show that the routing overhead compiled with our routing
algorithm is reduced by up to $69.30\%$ ($21.30\%$ on average) in the number of
CNOT gates and up to $43.50\%$ ($7.61\%$ on average) in the circuit depth

introduced that allow agents to communicate directly with one another. In this
paper, we propose an alternative approach whereby agents communicate through an
intelligent facilitator that learns to sift through and interpret signals
provided by all agents to improve the agents' collective performance. To ensure
that this facilitator does not become a centralized controller, agents are
incentivized to reduce their dependence on the messages it conveys, and the
messages can only influence the selection of a policy from a fixed set, not
instantaneous actions given the policy. We demonstrate the strength of this
architecture over existing baselines on several cooperative MARL environments.

using pseudo-spectral methods, which adopt a fringe-region approach to
introduce inflow boundary conditions. However, we notice that a standard
fringe-region technique excites spurious gravity waves when stratified
atmospheres are considered, therefore enhancing the amount of energy reflected
from the top of the domain and perturbing the velocity and pressure fields
downstream. In this work, we develop a new fringe-region method that imposes
the inflow conditions while limiting spurious effects on the surrounding flow.
This is achieved by locally damping the convective term in the vertical
momentum equation. We first apply the standard and wave-free fringe-region
techniques to two-dimensional inviscid-flow simulations subjected to 169
different atmospheric states. A similar study is performed on a
three-dimensional domain using a couple of atmospheric states. In all cases,
the new fringe-region technique outperforms the standard method, imposing the
inflow conditions with a minimal impact on the surrounding flow. Moreover, we
also investigate the performance of two already existing non-reflective upper
boundary conditions, that is a Rayleigh damping layer (RDL) and a radiation
condition (RC). Results highlight the importance of carefully tuning the RDL to
limit the distortion of the numerical solution. Also, we find that the tuned
RDL outperforms the RC in all cases. Finally, the tuned RDL together with the
wave-free fringe-region method are applied to an LES of a wind farm operating
in a conventionally neutral boundary layer, for which we measure a reflectivity
of only 0.75%.

structure prediction is to estimate the quality of predicted protein complex
structures without any knowledge of the corresponding native structures. Such
estimations can then be used to select high-quality predicted complex
structures to facilitate biomedical research such as protein function analysis
and drug discovery. We challenge this significant task with DProQ, which
introduces a gated neighborhood-modulating Graph Transformer (GGT) designed to
predict the quality of 3D protein complex structures. Notably, we incorporate
node and edge gates within a novel Graph Transformer framework to control
information flow during graph message passing. We train and evaluate DProQ on
four newly-developed datasets that we make publicly available in this work. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate that DProQ achieves state-of-the-art

poorly-known hyperonic interaction is a source of uncertainty for studying
laboratory hypernuclei and neutron star observations. In this work, we perform
Bayesian inference of phenomenological hyperon-nucleon interactions using the
tidal-deformability measurement of the GW170817 binary neutron star merger as
detected by LIGO/Virgo and the mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0541 and
PSR J0740+6620 as detected by NICER. The analysis is based on a set of stiff
relativistic neutron-star-matter equation of states with hyperons from the
relativistic mean-field theory, naturally fulfilling the causality requirement
and empirical nuclear matter properties. We specifically utilize the strong
correlation recently deduced between the scalar and vector meson hyperon
couplings, imposed by the measured $\Lambda$ separation energy in
single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei, and perform four different tests with or without
the strong correlation. We find that the laboratory hypernuclear constraint
ensures a large enough $\Lambda$-scalar-meson coupling to match the large
vector coupling in hyperon star matter. When adopting the current most probable
intervals of hyperon couplings from the joint analysis of laboratory and
astrophysical data, we find the maximum mass of hyperon stars is at most
$2.176^{+0.085}_{-0.202}M_{\odot}$ ($68\%$ credible interval) from the chosen
set of stiff equation of states. The reduction of the stellar radius due to

powerful tool to quantify the contribution of query concepts (represented by
user-defined guidance images) to a target class. For example, we can
quantitatively evaluate whether and to what extent concept striped contributes
to model prediction zebra with TCAV. Therefore, TCAV whitens the reasoning
process of deep networks. And it has been applied to solve practical problems
such as diagnosis. However, for some images where the target object only
occupies a small fraction of the region, TCAV evaluation may be interfered with
by redundant background features because TCAV calculates concept contribution
to a target class based on a whole hidden layer. To tackle this problem, based
on TCAV, we propose Spatial Activation Concept Vector (SACV) which identifies
the relevant spatial locations to the query concept while evaluating their
contributions to the model prediction of the target class. Experiment shows
that SACV generates a more fine-grained explanation map for a hidden layer and
quantifies concepts' contributions spatially. Moreover, it avoids interference
from background features. The code is available on

computationally intractable. Having a mixed-integer linear program (MIP) or a
nonlinear program (NLP) in the second stage further aggravates the
intractability, even when specialized algorithms that exploit problem structure
are employed. Finding high-quality (first-stage) solutions -- without
leveraging problem structure -- can be crucial in such settings. We develop
Neur2SP, a new method that approximates the expected value function via a
neural network to obtain a surrogate model that can be solved more efficiently
than the traditional extensive formulation approach. Neur2SP makes no
assumptions about the problem structure, in particular about the second-stage
problem, and can be implemented using an off-the-shelf MIP solver. Our
extensive computational experiments on four benchmark 2SP problem classes with
different structures (containing MIP and NLP second-stage problems) demonstrate
the efficiency (time) and efficacy (solution quality) of Neur2SP. In under 1.66
seconds, Neur2SP finds high-quality solutions across all problems even as the
number of scenarios increases, an ideal property that is difficult to have for
traditional 2SP solution techniques. Namely, the most generic baseline method
typically requires minutes to hours to find solutions of comparable quality.
