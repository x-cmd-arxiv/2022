model with treatments. The model is a system describing the evolution of
metastatic tumors and the number of cells present in a primary tumor. The
former evolution is described by a linear transport equation and the latter by
an ordinary differential equation of Gompertzian type. The two dynamics are
coupled through a nonlocal boundary condition that takes into account the tumor

deal with the coupling and to take into account the time discontinuities
generated by treatment terms. We also present numerical tests that highlight
the effect of different treatments.

abundant in many problem domains. In the critical problem of energy generation
scheduling for microgrids, one needs to decide when to switch energy supply
between a cheaper local generator with startup cost and the costlier on-demand
external grid, considering intermittent renewable generation and fluctuating
demands. Without knowledge of future input, competitive online algorithms are
appealing as they provide optimality guarantees against the optimal offline
solution. In practice, however, future input, e.g., wind generation, is often
predictable within a limited time window, and can be exploited to further
improve the competitiveness of online algorithms. In this paper, we exploit the
structure of information in the prediction window to design a novel
prediction-aware online algorithm for energy generation scheduling in
microgrids. Our algorithm achieves the best competitive ratio to date for this
important problem, which is at most $3-2/(1+\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{w})),$ where
$w$ is the prediction window size. We also characterize a non-trivial lower
bound of the competitive ratio and show that the competitive ratio of our
algorithm is only $9\%$ away from the lower bound, when a few hours of
prediction is available. Simulation results based on real-world traces
corroborate our theoretical analysis and highlight the advantage of our new
prediction-aware design.

characterized by slow ($\sim$Gyr) timescales. We find a quenching time of
approximately $4.91^{+0.91}_{-1.47} $Gyrs, consistent with the slow processes

interacting via the repulsive Yukawa potential and study the distortion of the
structure factor. It is predicted that the distortion is larger at small
wavevectors $k$ and its dependence on $Pe$ is a simple power law. At increasing
$Pe$, the main peak of the structure factor displays a broadening and shift
towards lower $k$ in the extensional sectors, which indicates shear-induced
spreading out of particle correlations and neighbor particles locally being
dragged away from the reference one. In the compressing sectors, instead, a
narrowing and shift towards high $k$ is predicted, reflecting shear-induced
ordering near contact and concomitant depletion in the medium-range. An overall
narrowing of the peak is also predicted for the structure factor averaged over
the whole solid angle. Calculations are also performed for hard spheres,
showing good overall agreement with experimental data. It is also shown that
the shear-induced structure factor distortion is orders of magnitude larger for
the Yukawa repulsion than for the hard spheres.

gravity with cosmological constant $\Lambda$. A non-minimal coupling term
$\xi\,R\,|\phi|^2$ is natural to add to the vortex as it preserves
gauge-invariance (here $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\xi$ a dimensionless
coupling constant). This term plays a dual role: it contributes to the
potential of the scalar field and to the Einstein-Hilbert term for gravity. As
a consequence, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar field and the
cosmological constant in the AdS$_3$ background depend on $\xi$. This leads to
a novel feature: there is a critical coupling $\xi_c$ where the VEV is zero for
$\xi\ge \xi_c$ but becomes non-zero when $\xi$ crosses below $\xi_c$ and the
gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. Moreover, we show that the VEV near the
critical coupling has a power law behaviour proportional to
$|\xi-\xi_c|^{1/2}$. Therefore $\xi_c$ can be viewed as the analog of the
critical temperature $T_c$ in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) mean-field theory where a
second-order phase transition occurs below $T_c$ and the order parameter has a
similar power law behaviour $|T-T_c|^{1/2}$ near $T_c$. The critical coupling
exists only in an AdS$_3$ background; it does not exist in asymptotically flat
spacetime (topologically a cone) where the VEV remains at a fixed non-zero
value independent of $\xi$. However, the deficit angle of the asymptotic
conical spacetime depends on $\xi$ and is no longer determined solely by the
mass; remarkably, a higher mass does not necessarily yield a higher deficit
angle. The equations of motion are more complicated with the non-minimal
coupling term present. However, via a convenient substitution one can reduce
the number of equations and solve them numerically to obtain exact vortex
solutions.

research on mining social media data, especially on mining social events.
Social event detection, due to its wide applications, has now become a trivial
task. State-of-the-art approaches exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
usually follow a two-step strategy: 1) constructing text graphs based on
various views (\textit{co-user}, \textit{co-entities} and
\textit{co-hashtags}); and 2) learning a unified text representation by a
specific GNN model. Generally, the results heavily rely on the quality of the
constructed graphs and the specific message passing scheme. However, existing
methods have deficiencies in both aspects: 1) They fail to recognize the noisy
information induced by unreliable views. 2) Temporal information which works as
a vital indicator of events is neglected in most works. To this end, we propose
ETGNN, a novel Evidential Temporal-aware Graph Neural Network. Specifically, we
construct view-specific graphs whose nodes are the texts and edges are
determined by several types of shared elements respectively. To incorporate
temporal information into the message passing scheme, we introduce a novel
temporal-aware aggregator which assigns weights to neighbours according to an
adaptive time exponential decay formula. Considering the view-specific
uncertainty, the representations of all views are converted into mass functions
through evidential deep learning (EDL) neural networks, and further combined
via Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to make the final detection. Experimental
results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ETGNN in
accuracy, reliability and robustness in social event detection.

arbitrary novel views following a given set of style examples, while ensuring
consistency when rendered from different views. Directly applying methods for
image or video stylization to 3D scenes cannot achieve such consistency. Thanks
to recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF), we are able to represent a
3D scene in a consistent way. Consistent 3D scene stylization can be
effectively achieved by stylizing the corresponding NeRF. However, there is a
significant domain gap between style examples which are 2D images and NeRF
which is an implicit volumetric representation. To address this problem, we
propose a novel mutual learning framework for 3D scene stylization that
combines a 2D image stylization network and NeRF to fuse the stylization
ability of 2D stylization network with the 3D consistency of NeRF. We first
pre-train a standard NeRF of the 3D scene to be stylized and replace its color
prediction module with a style network to obtain a stylized NeRF. It is
followed by distilling the prior knowledge of spatial consistency from NeRF to
the 2D stylization network through an introduced consistency loss. We also
introduce a mimic loss to supervise the mutual learning of the NeRF style
module and fine-tune the 2D stylization decoder. In order to further make our
model handle ambiguities of 2D stylization results, we introduce learnable
latent codes that obey the probability distributions conditioned on the style.
They are attached to training samples as conditional inputs to better learn the
style module in our novel stylized NeRF. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method is superior to existing approaches in both visual quality and
long-range consistency.

  Negative Representation Drift","version 2",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks over time, with
data distributions shifting from one task to another. When training on new task
data, data representations from old tasks may drift. Some negative
representation drift can result in catastrophic forgetting, by causing the
locally learned class prototypes and data representations to correlate poorly
across tasks. To mitigate such representation drift, we propose a method that
finds global prototypes to guide the learning, and learns data representations
with the regularization of the self-supervised information. Specifically, for
NLP tasks, we formulate each task in a masked language modeling style, and
learn the task via a neighbor attention mechanism over a pre-trained language
model. Experimental results show that our proposed method can learn fairly
consistent representations with less representation drift, and significantly
reduce catastrophic forgetting in CL without resampling data from past tasks.

selection problems (e.g., college admission or hiring), a recent line of
research proposed a model based on differential variance. This model assumes
that the decision-maker has a noisy estimate of each candidate's quality and
puts forward the difference in the noise variances between different
demographic groups as a key factor to explain discrimination. The literature on
differential variance, however, does not consider the strategic behavior of
candidates who can react to the selection procedure to improve their outcome,
which is well-known to happen in many domains.
  In this paper, we study how the strategic aspect affects fairness in
selection problems. We propose to model selection problems with strategic
candidates as a contest game: A population of rational candidates compete by
choosing an effort level to increase their quality. They incur a cost-of-effort
but get a (random) quality whose expectation equals the chosen effort. A
Bayesian decision-maker observes a noisy estimate of the quality of each
candidate (with differential variance) and selects the fraction $\alpha$ of
best candidates based on their posterior expected quality; each selected
candidate receives a reward $S$. We characterize the (unique) equilibrium of
this game in the different parameters' regimes, both when the decision-maker is
unconstrained and when they are constrained to respect the fairness notion of
demographic parity. Our results reveal important impacts of the strategic
behavior on the discrimination observed at equilibrium and allow us to
understand the effect of imposing demographic parity in this context. In
particular, we find that, in many cases, the results contrast with the
non-strategic setting.

generate valid poems, which are often comparable in quality to those written by

sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, while being capable of modelling
flexible input-output transformations.
  This is achieved by decomposing the generation process into three sub-tasks:
(1) tagging to decide on the subset of input tokens to be preserved in the

insertion to infill the missing tokens that are not present in the input. The
tagging and re-ordering steps, which are responsible for generating the largest

autoregressive decoder.
  Depending on the task, EdiT5 on average requires significantly fewer
autoregressive steps, demonstrating speedups of up to 25x when compared to
seq2seq models. Quality-wise, EdiT5 is initialized with a pre-trained T5
checkpoint yielding comparable performance to T5 in high-resource settings when

solutions for such problems has attracted a lot of attention in recent years,
and many global well-posedness results have been proved for a number of models
under the assumption that the initial data is both \emph{small} and
\emph{localized}. However, except for the completely integrable case, no such

  In this article we introduce a new, nonperturbative method, to prove global

\emph{non-localized}. Our main structural assumption is that our nonlinearity
is \emph{defocusing}. However, we do not assume that our problem has any exact
conservation laws. Our method is based on a robust reinterpretation of the idea
of interaction Morawetz estimates, developed almost 20 years ago by the I-team.
  In terms of scattering, we prove that our global solutions satisfy both
global $L^6$ Strichartz estimates and bilinear $L^2$ bounds. This is a Galilean
invariant result, which is new even for the classical defocusing cubic NLS.
There, by scaling our result also admits a large data counterpart.

in the context of left-right symmetric models (LRSM). In LRSM, the right handed
fermions transform as doublets under a newly introduced $SU(2)_R$ gauge
symmetry. This, along with a discrete parity symmetry $\mathcal{P}$ ensuring
identical gauge couplings of left and right sectors make the model left-right
symmetric, providing a dynamical origin of parity violation in electroweak
interactions via spontaneous symmetry breaking. The spontaneous breaking of
$\mathcal{P}$ leads to the formation of domain walls in the early universe.
These walls, if made unstable by introducing an explicit parity breaking term,
generate gravitational waves (GW) with a spectrum characterized by the wall
tension or the spontaneous $\mathcal{P}$ breaking scale, and the explicit
$\mathcal{P}$ breaking term. Considering explicit $\mathcal{P}$ breaking terms
to originate from Planck suppressed operators provides one-to-one
correspondence between the scale of left-right symmetry and sensitivities of
near future GW experiments. This is not only complementary to collider and low

model for relapse prediction. The model is personalized for a particular
patient by training using data from patients most similar to the given patient.
Several demographics and baseline mental health scores were considered as
personalization metrics to define patient similarity. We investigated the
effect of personalization on training dataset characteristics, learned
embeddings, and relapse prediction performance. We compared RelapsePredNet with
a deep learning-based anomaly detection model for relapse prediction. Further,
we investigated if RelapsePredNet could complement ClusterRFModel (a random
forest model leveraging clustering and template features proposed in prior
work) in a fusion model, by identifying latent behavioral features relevant for
relapse prediction. The CrossCheck dataset consisting of continuous mobile
sensing data obtained from 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to
a year, was used for our evaluations. The proposed RelapsePredNet outperformed
the deep learning-based anomaly detection model for relapse prediction. The F2
score for prediction were 0.21 and 0.52 in the full test set and the Relapse
Test Set (consisting of data from patients who have had relapse only),
respectively. These corresponded to a 29.4% and 38.8% improvement compared to
the existing deep learning-based model for relapse prediction.

treatment in various patient subgroups under one overarching protocol. We
propose a Bayesian approach to sample size determination in basket trials that
permit borrowing of information between commensurate subsets. Specifically, we
consider a randomised basket trial design where patients are randomly assigned
to the new treatment or a control within each trial subset (`subtrial' for
short). Closed-form sample size formulae are derived to ensure each subtrial
has a specified chance of correctly deciding whether the new treatment is
superior to or not better than the control by some clinically relevant
difference. Given pre-specified levels of pairwise (in)commensurability, the
subtrial sample sizes are solved simultaneously. The proposed Bayesian approach
resembles the frequentist formulation of the problem in yielding comparable
sample sizes for circumstances of no borrowing. When borrowing is enabled
between commensurate subtrials, a considerably smaller trial sample size is
required compared to the widely implemented approach of no borrowing. We
illustrate the use of our sample size formulae with two examples based on real
basket trials. A comprehensive simulation study further shows that the proposed
methodology can maintain the true positive and false positive rates at desired
levels.

that this trend holds for multiple mainstream models on two common NLU tasks:
intent recognition and semantic parsing. Rejecting class imbalance as the sole

source signal dilution, where strong lexical cues for the new symbol become
diluted as the training dataset grows. Selectively dropping training examples

strategies for incorporating the retrieved chunks into the generation process,
and for selecting the steps at which the model needs to search for neighbors in

electricity consumption during peak hours or when faced with an incidental
supply shortage. However, system operators typically have imperfect information
about their customers' baselines, that is, their consumption had the incentive
been absent. The standard approach to estimate the reduction in a customer's
electricity consumption then is to estimate their counterfactual baseline.
However, this approach is not robust to estimation errors or strategic
exploitation by the customers and can potentially lead to overpayments to
customers who do not reduce their consumption and underpayments to those who
do. Moreover, optimal power consumption reductions of the customers depend on
the costs that they incur for curtailing consumption, which in general are
private knowledge of the customers, and which they could strategically
misreport in an effort to improve their own utilities even if it deteriorates
the overall system cost. The two-stage mechanism proposed in this paper
circumvents the aforementioned issues. In the day-ahead market, the
participating loads are required to submit only a probabilistic description of
their next-day consumption and costs to the system operator for day-ahead
planning. It is only in real-time, if and when called upon for demand response,
that the loads are required to report their baselines and costs. They receive
credits for reductions below their reported baselines. The mechanism for
calculating the credits guarantees incentive compatibility of truthful
reporting of the probability distribution in the day-ahead market and truthful
reporting of the baseline and cost in real-time. The mechanism can be viewed as
an extension of the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism augmented with a
carefully crafted second-stage penalty for deviations from the day-ahead bids.

probably caused by a beyond the SM physics. Within a certain scenario of
extension of the SM, we obtain the relation
$\Delta_W\simeq\frac{3\alpha}{8\pi}M_W\simeq70$ MeV, where $\alpha$ is the

of longitudinal components of the $W$-bosons as the Goldstone bosons of a
spontaneously broken additional $SU(2)$ global symmetry at distances much
smaller than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. We argue that within this
scenario, the masses of charged Higgs scalars can get an electromagnetic
radiative contribution which enhances the observed value of $M_{W^\pm}$ with

the known one-loop result for the corresponding effective Coleman-Weinberg

Geo-Diverse Commonsense Multilingual Language Models Analysis (GeoMLAMA), for
probing the diversity of the relational knowledge in multilingual PLMs.
GeoMLAMA contains 3,125 prompts in English, Chinese, Hindi, Persian, and
Swahili, with a wide coverage of concepts shared by people from American,
Chinese, Indian, Iranian and Kenyan cultures. We benchmark 11 standard
multilingual PLMs on GeoMLAMA. Interestingly, we find that 1) larger
multilingual PLMs variants do not necessarily store geo-diverse concepts better
than its smaller variant; 2) multilingual PLMs are not intrinsically biased
towards knowledge from the Western countries (the United States); 3) the native
language of a country may not be the best language to probe its knowledge and
4) a language may better probe knowledge about a non-native country than its
native country. Code and data are released at

in which fetching (or evicting) pages from the same block incurs the same cost
as fetching (or evicting) just one page from the block. Given a cache of size
$k$, and a sequence of requests from $n$ pages partitioned into given blocks of
size $\beta\leq k$, the goal is to minimize the total cost of fetching to (or
evicting from) cache. We show the following results:
  $\bullet$ For the eviction cost model, we show an $O(\log k)$-approximate
offline algorithm, a $k$-competitive deterministic online algorithm, and an
$O(\log^2 k)$-competitive randomized online algorithm.
  $\bullet$ For the fetching cost model, we show an integrality gap of
$\Omega(\beta)$ for the natural LP relaxation of the problem, and an
$\Omega(\beta + \log k)$ lower bound for randomized online algorithms. The
strategy of ignoring the block-structure and running a classical paging
algorithm trivially achieves an $O(\beta)$ approximation and an $O(\beta \log
k)$ competitive ratio respectively for the offline and online-randomized

  $\bullet$ For both fetching and eviction models, we show improved bounds for
the $(h,k)$-bicriteria version of the problem. In particular, when $k=2h$, we
match the performance of classical caching algorithms up to constant factors.
  Our results establish a separation between the tractability of the fetching

are the same up to an additive term for classic caching. Previous work only
studied online deterministic algorithms for the fetching cost model when $k >
h$. Our insight is to relax the block-aware caching problem to a submodular
covering LP. The main technical challenge is to maintain a competitive
fractional solution, and to round it with bounded loss, as the constraints of
this LP are revealed online.

candidate for a universal function approximator for generic antisymmetric
functions, which are ubiquitous in quantum physics. However, this strategy
suffers from a sign problem, namely, due to near exact cancellation of positive
and negative contributions, the magnitude of the antisymmetrized function may
be significantly smaller than that before antisymmetrization. We prove that the
severity of the sign problem is directly related to the smoothness of the
activation function. For smooth activation functions (e.g., $\tanh$), the sign
problem of the explicitly antisymmetrized two-layer neural network deteriorates
super-polynomially with respect to the system size. On the other hand, for
rough activation functions (e.g., ReLU), the deterioration rate of the sign
problem can be tamed to be at most polynomial with respect to the system size.
Finally, the cost of a direct implementation of antisymmetrized two-layer

an efficient algorithm for approximate evaluation of such a network, of which
the cost scales polynomially with respect to the system size and inverse

compositional generalization in semantic parsing? We evaluate encoder-decoder

compare model scaling curves for three different methods for applying a
pre-trained language model to a new task: fine-tuning all parameters, prompt

Prompt-tuning can outperform fine-tuning, suggesting further potential

example, larger models are generally better at modeling the syntax of the

our study highlights limitations of current techniques for effectively
leveraging model scale for compositional generalization, while our analysis

Entailment is applicable to the problem of PCD, however viewing the policy as a

poor performance and lacks explainability. To address this challenge, more
recent proposals for PCD have argued for decomposing policies into expression

viable as a solution. A pilot program was run in-home monitoring system to test
the efficacy of this system. This paper focuses on an economic analysis to
better understand the financial viability of such systems. Using a secondary
analysis approach, the findings identified that revenue could be generated by
providing carers with additional services such as real-time monitoring of the
client, which can foster deeper relationships with the customer, along with
savings of healthcare costs to carers, service providers and Government.
Savings are related to the earlier intervention of critical events that are
identified by the system, as delays in treatment of some critical events can
create much more severe and costly health outcomes. Further health costs
savings can be made via trend analysis which can show more nuanced health
deterioration that is often missed. The implementation of preventative measures
via this identification can reduce the chances of critical events occurring
which have much higher costs. Overall, monitoring systems lead to a transition

brighter than $G = 16$ using BP/RP spectra. At fainter magnitudes true

EFT provides an organizing principle for gravity at low energies in terms of
physical symmetries, and allows interactions consistent with linearized

parameter spaces in beyond-the-Standard Model theories. We evaluate the model
likelihood for any choice of parameters by sampling the theory parameters
intelligently and building a Kernel Density Estimator. By reducing the number
of expensive Monte-Carlo simulations, this method provides a more efficient way
to test complex theories. We illustrate our technique to set new limits on a
short-lived heavy neutrino $N$, proposed as an explanation of anomalies in
neutrino experiments. Using a search for lepton pairs in the T2K near detector,
we find exclusion limits on the model parameters in a vast region of parameter
space, fully exploiting the advantages of our new method. With a single Monte
Carlo simulation, we obtain the differential event rate for arbitrary choices
of model parameters, allowing us to cast limits on any slice of the model
parameter space. We conclude that $N$ particles with lifetimes greater than $c
\tau^0 \gtrsim 3~$cm are excluded by T2K data. We also derive model-independent
constraints in terms of the total rate, lifetime, and $N$ mass and provide an
approximated analytical formula. This method can be applied in other branches
of physics to explore the landscape of theory parameters efficiently.

connections between the ensemble variability of AGN and black-hole mass,
accretion rate, bolometric luminosity, redshift, and obscuration of the source.
Given its features, our dataset opens up the exploration of samples ~2 mag
fainter than most of the literature to date. We identify several samples of AGN
- 677 in total - obtained by a variety of selection techniques which partly
overlap. Our analysis compares results for the various samples. We split each
sample in two based on the median of the physical property of interest, and
analyze differences in the shape and slope of the SF, and possible causes.
While the shape of the SF does not change with depth, it is highly affected by
the type of AGN (unobscured/obscured) included in the sample. Where a linear
region can be identified, we find that the variability amplitude anticorrelates
with accretion rate and bolometric luminosity, consistent with previous

We also assume that only higher-energy protons (~> TeV) can penetrate the dense

we model Magellan/Megacam imaging of the Centaurus A's (Cen A) disrupting dwarf
companion Dwarf 3 (Dw3) and its associated stellar stream, to find out what can
be learned about the Cen A dark-matter halo. We develop a novel external galaxy
stream-fitting technique and generate model stellar streams that reproduce the
stream morphology visible in the imaging. We find that there are many viable
stream models that fit the data well, with reasonable parameters, provided that
Cen A has a halo mass larger than M$_{200}$ $>4.70\times 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$.
There is a second stream in Cen A's halo that is also reproduced within the
context of this same dynamical model. However, stream morphology in the imaging
alone does not uniquely determine the mass or mass distribution for the Cen A
halo. In particular, the stream models with high likelihood show covariances
between the inferred Cen A mass distribution, the inferred Dw3 progenitor mass,
the Dw3 velocity, and the Dw3 line-of-sight position. We show that these
degeneracies can be broken with radial-velocity measurements along the stream,
and that a single radial velocity measurement puts a substantial lower limit on
the halo mass. These results suggest that targeted radial-velocity measurements
will be critical if we want to learn about dark matter from extragalactic

maximum light followed by a near constant linear decline in luminosity. Optical
spectroscopy over the first 40 days revealed a highly reddened object with
narrow Balmer emission lines seen in Type IIn supernovae. The slow rise to
maximum in the optical lightcurve combined with the lack of broad H$\alpha$
emission suggest the presence of very optically thick and close circumstellar
material (CSM) that quickly decelerated the supernova ejecta. This CSM was
likely created from a massive star progenitor with an $\dot{M}$ $\sim$ 0.3
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ lost in a previous eruptive episode 3--4 years before
eruption, similar to giant eruptions of luminous blue variable stars. At late

powerful technique for the direct characterisation of giant exoplanets. The
high spectral resolution not only brings a major gain in terms of accessible
spectral features but also enables a better separation of the stellar and
planetary signals. Ongoing projects such as Keck/KPIC, Subaru/REACH, and
VLT/HiRISE base their observing strategy on the use of a few science fibres,
one of which is dedicated to sampling the planet's signal, while the others
sample the residual starlight in the speckle field. The main challenge in this
approach is to blindly centre the planet's point spread function (PSF)
accurately on the science fibre, with an accuracy of less than 0.1 $\lambda/D$
to maximise the coupling efficiency. In the context of the HiRISE project,
three possible centring strategies are foreseen, either based on
retro-injecting calibration fibres to localise the position of the science
fibre or based on a dedicated centring fibre. We implemented these three
approaches, and we compared their centring accuracy using an upgraded setup of
the MITHiC high-contrast imaging testbed, which is similar to the setup that
will be adopted in HiRISE. Our results demonstrate that reaching a
specification accuracy of 0.1 $\lambda/D$ is extremely challenging regardless
of the chosen centring strategy. It requires a high level of accuracy at every
step of the centring procedure, which can be reached with very stable
instruments. We studied the contributors to the centring error in the case of
MITHiC and we propose a quantification for some of the most impacting terms.

\nu^{-1.6}$) with an extent of 1.2 Mpc at 54 MHz. Its morphology follows the
distribution of the thermal intra-cluster medium inferred from the Chandra

radio relic with projected extent of 500 kpc. From the relic, a 600 kpc long
bridge departs and connect it to the halo. Between the relic and the radio
galaxy, we observe what is most likely a radio phoenix, given its curved
spectrum. The phoenix is connected to the tail of the radio galaxy through two
arms, which show a nearly constant spectral index for 300 kpc. The halo could
be produced by turbulence induced by a major merger, with its axis lying in the
NE-SW direction. This is supported by the position of the relic, whose origin
could be attributed to a shock propagating along the merger axis. It is
possible that the same shock has also produced the phoenix through adiabatic
compression, while the bridge could be generated by electrons which were
pre-accelerated by the shock, and then re-accelerated by turbulence. Finally,
we detect hints of gentle re-energisation in the two arms which depart from the

electromagnetic emission include an inflated cocoon, surrounding a jet choked
in the extended stellar envelope. In alternative, the observed radiation may
arise from the disk formed by the delayed merger of a black hole with a
Wolf-Rayet star. We explore the neutrino production in these scenarios, i.e.
internal shocks in a choked jet and interaction between the outflow and the
circumstellar medium (CSM). If observed on-axis, the choked jet provides the
dominant contribution to the neutrino fluence. Intriguingly, the IceCube upper
limit on the neutrino emission inferred from the closest LFBOT, AT2018cow,
excludes a region of the parameter space otherwise allowed by electromagnetic
observations. After correcting for the Eddington bias on the observation of
cosmic neutrinos, we conclude that the emission from an on-axis choked jet and
CSM interaction is compatible with the detection of two track-like neutrino
events observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in coincidence with
AT2018cow, and otherwise considered to be of atmospheric origin. While the
neutrino emission from LFBOTs does not constitute the bulk of the diffuse
background of neutrinos observed by IceCube, detection prospects of nearby

we show that ADAPT-QAOA exhibits substantial flexibility in entangling and

+ HCO, in addition to CH3O + H -> CH3OH, as a very promising and possibly
dominating (70 - 90 %) final step to form CH3OH in those environments. Here, we
compare the contributions of these two steps leading to methanol by
experimentally investigating hydrogenation reactions on H2CO and D2CO ices,
which ensures comparable starting points between the two scenarios. The
experiments are performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and astronomically
relevant temperatures, with H:H2CO (or D2CO) flux ratios of 10:1 and 30:1. The
radical-molecule route in the partially deuterated scenario, CHD2O + D2CO ->
CHD2OD + DCO, is significantly hampered by the isotope effect in the
D-abstraction process, and can thus be used as an artifice to probe the
efficiency of this step. We observe a significantly smaller yield of D2CO + H
products in comparison to H2CO + H, implying that the CH3O-induced abstraction
route must play an important role in the formation of methanol in interstellar
ices. Reflection-Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (RAIRS) and Temperature

lines show correlated variability with the equivalent widths increasing with
decreasing flux. This together with the C IV emission-line variability is
consistent with ionization being the main driver of the correlated variability.
The observed UV-continuum variations are weaker than what is required by the
photo-ionization models. This together with a scatter in the C iv equivalent
width at a given continuum flux can be understood if variations of the C IV
ionizing photons are much larger than that of the UV continuum, the variations
in the ionizing photon and UV fluxes are not correlated and/or the covering
factor of the flow varies continuously. We suggest BAL-A is produced by a
stable clumpy outflow located beyond the broad emission line region and BAL-C
is a newly formed wind component located near the accretion disk and both
respond to changes in the ionizing continuum.

understanding. In particular, models which are quick to evaluate, and are

In these simulations, we implement heating rates that are based on nuclear

accretion, with a handful of bright flares accompanied with orbital motion
close to the horizon. It has been proposed that gas supply comes from stellar
winds in the neighborhood of the supermassive black hole. We here argue that
the flow at the vicinity of the black hole has a low magnetization and a
structure of alternating polarity totally dictated by the well studied and
long-ago proposed MRI turbulent process. This can be the case, provided that in
larger distances from the black hole magnetic diffusivity is dominant and thus
the magnetic field will never reach equipartition values. For $\rm SgrA^*$, we
show the immediate consequences of this specific magnetic field geometry, which
are: (i) an intermittent flow that passes from quiescent states to flaring
activity, (ii) no quasi-steady-state jet, (iii) no possibility of a
magnetically arrested configuration. Moreover a further distinctive feature of
this geometry is the intense magnetic reconnection events, occurring as layers
of opposite magnetic polarity are accreted, in the vicinity of the black hole.
Finally, we argue that the absence of a jet structure in such case will be a
smoking gun in 43 \& 86 GHz observations.

Acting on plasma scales to galactic environments, CRs are usually modeled as a
fluid, using the CR energy density as the evolving quantity. This method comes
with the flaw that the corresponding CR evolution equation is not in
conservative form as it contains an adiabatic source term that couples CRs to
the thermal gas. In the absence of non-adiabatic changes, instead evolving the
CR entropy density is a physically equivalent option that avoids this potential
numerical inconsistency. In this work, we study both approaches for evolving
CRs in the context of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the
massively parallel moving-mesh code AREPO. We investigate the performance of
both methods in a sequence of shock-tube tests with various resolutions and
shock Mach numbers. We find that the entropy-conserving scheme performs best
for the idealized case of purely adiabatic CRs across the shock while both
approaches yield similar results at lower resolution. In this setup, both
schemes operate well and almost independently of the shock Mach number. Taking
active CR acceleration at the shock into account, the energy-based method
proves to be numerically much more stable and significantly more accurate in
determining the shock velocity, in particular at low resolution, which is more
typical for astrophysical large-scale simulations. For a more realistic
application, we simulate the formation of several isolated galaxies at
different halo masses and find that both numerical methods yield almost
identical results with differences far below common astrophysical
uncertainties.

  Accepted in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac3390",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries are considered to be one of the most
important sources of Gravitational Waves (GW) that can be detected by GW
detectors like LISA. However, there are a lot of uncertainties in the dynamics
of MBH binaries in the stages leading up to the GW-emission phase. It has been
recently suggested that Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) could provide a viable
route to overcome the final parsec problem for MBH binaries at the center of
galaxies. NSCs are collisional systems where the dynamics would be altered by
the presence of a mass spectrum. In this study, we use a suite of
high-resolution $N$-body simulations with over 1 million particles to
understand how collisional relaxation under the presence of a mass spectrum of
NSC particles affects the dynamics of the MBH binary under the merger of two
NSCs. We consider MBH binaries with different mass ratios and additional
non-relaxed models. We find that mass-segregation driven by collisional
relaxation can lead to accelerated hardening in lower mass ratio binaries but
has the opposite effect in higher mass ratio binaries. Crucially, the relaxed
models also demonstrate much lower eccentricities at binary formation and
negligible growth during hardening stages leading to longer merger timescales.
The results are robust and highlight the importance of collisional relaxation
on changing the dynamics of the binary. Our models are state-of-the-art, use
zero softening, and high enough particle numbers to model NSCs realistically.

M31 disk, which are lifted to the CGM by advection due to outflow and CR
diffusion. The advection time scale due to bulk flow of gas triggered by star
formation activity in the M31 disc is comparable ($\sim$ Gyr) to the diffusion
time scale with diffusion coefficient $\ge10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ for the
propagation of CR protons with energy $\sim 412$ GeV that are responsible for
the highest energy photons observed. We show that a leptonic origin of the
$\gamma$-rays from cosmic ray (CR) electrons has difficulties, as the inverse
Compton time scale ($\sim$Myr) is much lower than advection time scale
($\sim$Gyr) to reach $120$ kpc. Invoking CR electrons accelerated by accretion
shocks in the CGM at $\sim100-120$ kpc does not help since it would lead to
diffuse X-ray features that are not observed. We, therefore, study the
production of $\gamma$-rays via hadronic interaction between CR protons and CGM
gas with the help of numerical two-fluid (thermal + CR) hydrodynamical

smallness of dark energy, we predict the existence of a light tower of states
and a unique extra mesoscopic dimension of length $l\sim
\Lambda^{-\frac{1}{4}}\sim 10^{-6}\, m$, with extra massless fermions
propagating on it. This automatically leads to a candidate for a tower of
sterile neutrinos, and an associated active neutrino mass scale $m_{\nu}\sim

assuming the mechanism for stabilization of this dark dimension leads to
similar masses for active and sterile neutrinos we are led to the prediction of
a Higgs vev $\langle H\rangle \sim \Lambda^{\frac{1}{6}}M_{pl}^{\frac{1}{3}}$.
Another prediction of the scenario is a species scale ${\hat M} \sim \Lambda^

the higher-dimensional Planck scale. This energy scale may be related to the

developing an algorithm for searching the respective SNN parameter values that

planets and a massive planetesimal disk over the age of the Solar System. The
main question addressed in this study is whether distant trans-Neptunian

perturbations and the self-gravity of the disk. Methods. We carried out a
series of full N-body numerical simulations of gravitational interactions
between the giant planets and a massive outer disk of planetesimals. Results.
Our simulations show that the collective gravity of the giant planets and
massive planetesimals produces distant trans-Neptunian objects across a wide
range of the initial disk mass. The majority of objects that survive up through
the age of the Solar System have perihelion distances of q > 40 au. In this
region, there is a tendency toward a slow decrease in eccentricities and an
increase in perihelion distances for objects with semimajor axes a > 150 au.
Secular resonances between distant planetesimals play a major role in
increasing their perihelion distances. This explains the origin of Sedna-type
objects. In our integrations for the age of the Solar System, we registered
times with both high and low clustering of longitudes of perihelion and
arguments of perihelion for objects with q > 40 au, a > 150 au. The resulting
distribution of inclinations in our model and the observed distribution of
inclinations for distant trans-Neptunian objects have similar average values of
around 20 degrees. Conclusions. Distant trans-Neptunian objects are a natural
consequence in the models that include migrating giant planets and a
self-gravitating planetesimal disk.

particular, this gives the polystability of reflexive sheaves under symmetric

over normal varieties smooth in codimension two is built by showing that an

a lower bound for the discriminants of any Kaehler resolutions, which gives a
Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality over normal varieties and a characterization of
the equality using projectively flat connections. We discuss typical cases
including normal surfaces and varieties smooth in codimension two where we
could simplify the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality and endow it with topological

dimensional data points can be projected down to $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$
dimensions such that the square of their pairwise distances is preserved up to
a small distortion $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. It has been proved that the JL lemma is
optimal for the general case, therefore, improvements can only be explored for
special cases. This work aims to improve the $\epsilon^{-2}$ dependency based
on techniques inspired by the Hutch++ Algorithm, which reduces $\epsilon^{-2}$
to $\epsilon^{-1}$ for the related problem of implicit matrix trace estimation.
We first present an algorithm to estimate the Euclidean lengths of the rows of
a matrix. We prove for it element-wise probabilistic bounds that are at least
as good as standard JL approximations in the worst-case, but are asymptotically
better for matrices with decaying spectrum. Moreover, for any matrix,
regardless of its spectrum, the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-accuracy for the
total, Frobenius norm-wise relative error using only $O(\epsilon^{-1})$
queries. This is a quadratic improvement over the norm-wise error of standard
JL approximations. We also show how these results can be extended to estimate
(i) the Euclidean distances between data points and (ii) the statistical
leverage scores of tall-and-skinny data matrices, which are ubiquitous for many
applications, with analogous theoretical improvements. Proof-of-concept
numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

motivating popular antiviruses (AVs) to develop dedicated detection strategies,

data distribution (i.e., concept drifts) that directly affect ML model

work. In this work, we evaluate the impact of concept drift on malware
classifiers for two Android datasets: DREBIN (about 130K apps) and a subset of
AndroZoo (about 285K apps). We used these datasets to train an Adaptive Random

classifier. We also ordered all datasets samples using their VirusTotal
submission timestamp and then extracted features from their textual attributes
using two algorithms (Word2Vec and TF-IDF). Then, we conducted experiments
comparing both feature extractors, classifiers, as well as four drift detectors
(DDM, EDDM, ADWIN, and KSWIN) to determine the best approach for real
environments. Finally, we compare some possible approaches to mitigate concept
drift and propose a novel data stream pipeline that updates both the classifier

(i) classifying malware samples collected over nine years (2009-2018), (ii)
reviewing concept drift detection algorithms to attest its pervasiveness, (iii)
comparing distinct ML approaches to mitigate the issue, and (iv) proposing an

Through a conformal mapping technique, we compute solutions of the steady Euler

that although it is possible to compute solitary waves for the steady Euler

rigorously examined by the help of thermal negativities. The model comprises
two nearest-neighbor exchange couplings $J_1$ and $J_2$ such that $J_1\gg J_2$.
When the cyclic four-spin exchange is zero, the maximum value of whole
entanglement $\Pi_4$ is achieved at low enough temperatures and relatively high
magnetic fields $(B\approx J_1)$. Also, maximum bipartite entanglement between
pair spins with exchange coupling $J_1$ is achievable at high temperature and
high magnetic field. This quantity remains alive for sufficiently high
temperature and high magnetic field values comparable with the relevant
exchange coupling $J_1$. A nonzero value of the cyclic four-spin exchange
notably enhances the degree of the whole entanglement, while it weakens the
bipartite entanglement degree. We demonstrate that the whole entanglement
reaches an unconventional minimum at a special parameter region of cyclic
four-spin exchange almost ten order of magnitude smaller than $J_1$, where the
system is in a quantum antiferromagnetic state. The real complex

within communities. Hence, it is critical to design effective strategies to
reduce the non-medical use of opioids that can occur via diversion at the
patient level. In this paper, we aim to address this critical public health
problem by designing strategies for the return and safe disposal of unused

determine the optimal incentive disbursement plans and locations of easily
accessible opioid disposal kiosks to motivate prescription opioid users of
diverse profiles in returning their unused opioids. We develop a Mixed-Integer
Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model to solve the decision problem, followed by
a reformulation scheme using Benders Decomposition that results in a
computationally efficient solution. We present a case study to show the

estimate and include a penalty cost considering the economic and healthcare

variety of types of interpretation beyond the simple case of identity reference
to entities introduced via nominal expressions covered by the traditional
coreference task in its most recent incarnation in ONTONOTES and similar
datasets. One of these cases that go beyond simple coreference is anaphoric
reference to entities that must be added to the discourse model via
accommodation, and in particular split-antecedent references to entities
constructed out of other entities, as in split-antecedent plurals and in some
cases of discourse deixis. Although this type of anaphoric reference is now
annotated in many datasets, systems interpreting such references cannot be
evaluated using the Reference coreference scorer Pradhan et al. (2014). As part
of the work towards a new scorer for anaphoric reference able to evaluate all
aspects of anaphoric interpretation in the coverage of the Universal Anaphora
initiative, we propose in this paper a solution to the technical problem of
generalizing existing metrics for identity anaphora so that they can also be
used to score cases of split-antecedents. This is the first such proposal in
the literature on anaphora or coreference, and has been successfully used to
score both split-antecedent plural references and discourse deixis in the
recent CODI/CRAC anaphora resolution in dialogue shared tasks.

than the full degree-$6$ SoS. Remarkably, this fragment is very similar to one
studied by Hastings and O'Donnell for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.

example within the scenario of isolated binary evolution is mass-ratio
reversal: even assuming efficient core-envelope coupling in massive stars and
tidal spin-up of the stellar companion by the first-born black hole, a compact
binary with a lighter, non-spinning first-born black hole and a heavier,

used population models by including negligible-spin subpopulations and, most
crucially, non-identical component spin distributions. We do not find evidence
for subpopulations of black holes with negligible spins and measure the
fraction of massive binary stars undergoing mass-ratio reversal to be
consistent with zero and $<32\%$ ($99\%$ confidence). The dimensionless spin

based on a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system in conjunction
with optimization and non-invasive, clinical input measurements to approximate
important cardiac parameters, including left ventricle elastances. A subset of
parameters of a multi-compartment lumped parameter model was estimated using
1st order Adam gradient descent and hybrid Adam and 2nd order quasi-Newton
limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimization routines.
Forward-mode automatic differentiation was used to estimate the Jacobian
matrices and compared to the common finite differences approach. Synthetic data
of healthy and diseased hearts were generated as proxies for non-invasive
clinical measurements and used to evaluate the algorithm. Twelve parameters
including left ventricle elastances were selected for optimization based on 99%
explained variation in mean left ventricle pressure and volume. The hybrid
optimization strategy yielded the best overall results compared to 1st order
optimization with automatic differentiation and finite difference approaches,
with mean absolute percentage errors ranging from 6.67% to 14,14%. Errors in
left ventricle elastance estimates for simulated aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation were smallest when including synthetic measurements for arterial
pressure and valvular flow rate at approximately 2% and degraded to roughly 5%

tracking of the left ventricle pressure waveforms and may be considered when

future wireless systems has spurred interest in short block-length codes. In
this context, we introduce a new class of high-dimension constant curvature
curves codes for analog error correction of independent continuous-alphabet
uniform sources. In particular, we employ the circumradius function from knot
theory to prescribe insulating tubes about the centerline of constant curvature
curves. We then use tube packing density within a hypersphere to optimize the
curve parameters. The resulting constant curvature curve tube (C3T) codes
possess the smallest possible latency -- block-length is unity under bandwidth
expansion mapping. Further, the codes provide within $5$ dB of Shannon's
optimal performance theoretically achievable at the lower range of
signal-to-noise ratios and BW expansion factors. We exploit the fact that the
C3T encoder locus is a geodesic on a flat torus in even dimensions and a
generalized helix in odd dimensions to obtain useful code properties and
provide noise-reducing projections at the decoder stage. We validate the
performance of these codes using fully connected multi-layer perceptrons that
approximate maximum likelihood decoders. For the case of independent and
identically distributed uniform sources, we show that analog error correction
is advantageous over digital coding in terms of required block-lengths needed
to match {signal-to-noise ratio, source-to-distortion ratio} tuples. The best
possible digital codes require two to three orders of magnitude higher latency
compared to C3T codes, thereby demonstrating the latter's utility for URLLC.

remains elusive despite the importance of these ecosystems to global

protozoan predators of bacteria -- remineralize soil nutrients and shape the
bacterial community. However, their foraging strategies and their role as
microbial ecosystem engineers remain unknown. Here we present a multi-scale
approach, connecting microscopic single-cell analysis and macroscopic whole
ecosystem dynamics, to expose a phylogenetically widespread foraging strategy,
in which an amoeba population spontaneously partitions between cells with fast,
polarized movement and cells with slow, unpolarized movement. Such
differentiated motion gives rise to efficient colony expansion and consumption
of the bacterial substrate. From these insights we construct a theoretical
model that predicts how disturbances to amoeba growth rate and movement disrupt
their predation efficiency. These disturbances correspond to distinct classes
of bacterial defenses, which allows us to experimentally validate our
predictions. All considered, our characterization of amoeba foraging identifies
amoeba mobility, and not amoeba growth, as the core determinant of predation
efficiency and a key target for bacterial defense systems.

In this paper, we present the latest Chandra observations of the Virgo cluster
galaxy NGC 4438, which hosts multi-scale bubbles detected in various bands. The
galaxy also has low current star formation activity, so these bubbles are
evidently produced by the AGN rather than a starburst. We present spatially
resolved spectral analysis of the Chandra data of the

naturally explained as synchrotron emission from high-energy CR leptons. The
hot gas temperature increases, while the overall contribution of the
non-thermal X-ray emission decreases with the vertical distance from the
galactic plane. We calculate the synchrotron cooling timescale of the CR
leptons responsible for the non-thermal hard X-ray emission to be only a few
tens to a few hundreds of years. The thermal pressure of the hot gas is about
three times the magnetic pressure, but the current data cannot rule out the
possibility that they are still in pressure balance. The spatially resolved
spectroscopy presented in this paper may have important constraints on how the
AGN accelerates CRs and drives outflows. We also discover a transient X-ray

the bulges since $z=0.1$ using photometric parameters of nearly 39,000 unbarred
disc galaxies from SDSS DR7 which are well represented by two components. We
adopted a combination of the S\'ersic index and Kormendy relation to separate
classical bulges and disc-like pseudo-bulges. We found that the fraction of
pseudo-bulges (classical bulges) smoothly increases (decreases) as the Universe
gets older. In the history of the Universe, there comes a point ($z \approx
0.016$) when classical bulges and pseudo-bulges become equal in number. The
fraction of pseudo-bulges rises with increasing bulge to disc half-light radius
ratio until R$_{\rm e}$/R$_{\rm hlr} \approx 0.6$ suggesting concentrated disc
is the most favourable place for pseudo-bulge formation. The mean ellipticity
of pseudo-bulges is always greater than that of classical bulges and it
decreases with decreasing redshift indicating that the bulges tend to be more
axisymmetric with evolution. Also, the massive bulges are progressing towards
axisymmetry at steeper rate than the low-mass bulges. There is no tight
correlation of bulge S\'ersic index evolution with other photometric properties
of the galaxy. Using the sample of multi-component fitting of $S^4G$ data and

36\times 36$) has allowed us to identify a rich phase diagram as a function of
the magnetic flux and the disorder strength. For sufficiently weak disorder,
and not too strong magnetic flux, we observe a slightly distorted Abrikosov
triangular vortex lattice. An increase in the magnetic flux leads to an
unexpected rectangular vortex lattice. A further increase in disorder, or flux
gradually destroy the lattice symmetry though strong vortex repulsion persists.
An even stronger disorder leads to deformed single vortices with an
inhomogeneous core. As number of vortices increases, vortices overlap becomes
more frequent. Finally, we show that global phase coherence is a feature of all
these phases and that disorder enhances substantially the critical magnetic
flux with respect to the clean limit with a maximum on the metallic side of the
insulating transition.

encrypted using a cryptography algorithm to prevent database hacking. There
will be a randomized clickable image grid in our system. By clicking on this

developed another method namely shoulder surfing resistant password. To prevent

  Copy Detection","Accepted to AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Image copy detection (ICD) aims to determine whether a query image is an
edited copy of any image from a reference set. Currently, there are very
limited public benchmarks for ICD, while all overlook a critical challenge in
real-world applications, i.e., the distraction from hard negative queries.
Specifically, some queries are not edited copies but are inherently similar to
some reference images. These hard negative queries are easily false recognized
as edited copies, significantly compromising the ICD accuracy. This observation
motivates us to build the first ICD benchmark featuring this characteristic.
Based on existing ICD datasets, this paper constructs a new dataset by
additionally adding 100, 000 and 24, 252 hard negative pairs into the training
and test set, respectively. Moreover, this paper further reveals a unique
difficulty for solving the hard negative problem in ICD, i.e., there is a
fundamental conflict between current metric learning and ICD. This conflict is:
the metric learning adopts symmetric distance while the edited copy is an
asymmetric (unidirectional) process, e.g., a partial crop is close to its
holistic reference image and is an edited copy, while the latter cannot be the
edited copy of the former (in spite the distance is equally small). This
insight results in an Asymmetrical-Similarity Learning (ASL) method, which
allows the similarity in two directions (the query <-> the reference image) to
be different from each other. Experimental results show that ASL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin, confirming that solving the
symmetric-asymmetric conflict is critical for ICD. The NDEC dataset and code
are available at https://github.com/WangWenhao0716/ASL.

functions in real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulation, we
connect the winding number, a topological invariant, to a molecular-level
understanding of the quantized pumping. While the pumping dynamics constitutes
the opposing movement of the Wannier functions that represent both double and
single bonds, the resulting current is unidirectional due to the greater number
of double-bond electrons. Using a gauge-invariant formulation called dynamical
transition orbitals, an alternative viewpoint on the nonequilibrium dynamics is
obtained in terms of the particle-hole excitation. A single time-dependent
transition orbital is found to be largely responsible for the observed
quantized pumping. In this representation, the pumping dynamics manifests
itself in the dynamics of this single orbital as it undergoes changes from its
{\pi} bonding orbital character at equilibrium to acquiring resonance and
antibonding character in the driving cycle. The work demonstrates the Floquet
engineering of the nonadiabatic topological state in an extended molecular

This requirement has eliminated a number of possible source types, but several
remain. Identifying the physical nature of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) emitters
arguably requires good localisation of more detections, and broadband studies
enabled by real-time alerting. We here present the Apertif Radio Transient
System (ARTS), a supercomputing radio-telescope instrument that performs
real-time FRB detection and localisation on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT) interferometer. It reaches coherent-addition sensitivity over
the entire field of the view of the primary dish beam. After commissioning
results verified the system performed as planned, we initiated the Apertif FRB
survey (ALERT). Over the first 5 weeks we observed at design sensitivity in
2019, we detected 5 new FRBs, and interferometrically localised each of these
to 0.4--10 sq. arcmin. All detections are broad band and very narrow, of order
1 ms duration, and unscattered. Dispersion measures are generally high. Only
through the very high time and frequency resolution of ARTS are these
hard-to-find FRBs detected, producing an unbiased view of the intrinsic
population properties. Most localisation regions are small enough to rule out
the presence of associated persistent radio sources. Three FRBs cut through the
halos of M31 and M33. We demonstrate that Apertif can localise one-off FRBs
with an accuracy that maps magneto-ionic material along well-defined lines of
sight. The rate of 1 every ~7 days next ensures a considerable number of new
sources are detected for such study. The combination of detection rate and
localisation accuracy exemplified by the 5 first ARTS FRBs thus marks a new
phase in which a growing number of bursts can be used to probe our Universe.

in \cite{scetbon2021lowrank} holds several promises in that regard, and was
shown to complement more established entropic regularization approaches, being
able to insert itself in more complex pipelines, such as quadratic OT. LOT
restricts the search for low-cost couplings to those that have a
low-nonnegative rank, yielding linear time algorithms in cases of interest.
However, these promises can only be fulfilled if the LOT approach is seen as a
legitimate contender to entropic regularization when compared on properties of
interest, where the scorecard typically includes theoretical properties
(statistical complexity and relation to other methods) or practical aspects
(debiasing, hyperparameter tuning, initialization). We target each of these
areas in this paper in order to cement the impact of low-rank approaches in
computational OT.

explain the observable traits of SNe Ia. A promising pathway is the
double-detonation scenario, where a white dwarf accretes a shell of helium-rich
material from a companion and a detonation in the resulting helium shell is the
primary cause of the explosion. Through a set of two-dimensional grid-based
simulations of this scenario we clearly distinguish three phases of evolution:
external helium-rich detonation, core compressive heating, and a final core
carbon burn. Though final disruption of the whole system is achieved at all
resolutions, only models with minimum resolutions of 4~km and better exhibit
all three phases. Particularly, core compression heating is only observed for
higher resolutions, producing qualitatively different nucleosynthetic outcomes.
We identify the effect of finer spatial resolution on the mixing of hot silicon
at the interface between the detonating helium layer and the underlying C/O WD
as a primary driver of these dynamic differences.

for negatively correlated sets. DPPs have been successfully employed in Machine
Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data.
In seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza conjectured in his PhD
Thesis (2011) that the problem of finding a maximum likelihood DPP model for a
given data set is NP-complete.
  In this work we prove Kulesza's conjecture. In fact, we prove the following
stronger hardness of approximation result: even computing a
$\left(1-O(\frac{1}{\log^9{N}})\right)$-approximation to the maximum
log-likelihood of a DPP on a ground set of $N$ elements is NP-complete. At the
same time, we also obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a
nontrivial worst-case approximation to the optimal log-likelihood: the
approximation factor is $\frac{1}{(1+o(1))\log{m}}$ unconditionally (for data
sets that consist of $m$ subsets), and can be improved to $1-\frac{1+o(1)}{\log
N}$ if all $N$ elements appear in a $O(1/N)$-fraction of the subsets.
  In terms of techniques, we reduce approximating the maximum log-likelihood of
DPPs on a data set to solving a gap instance of a ""vector coloring"" problem on
a hypergraph. Such a hypergraph is built on a bounded-degree graph construction
of Bogdanov, Obata and Trevisan (FOCS 2002), and is further enhanced by the

Attribute Extraction) dataset as a challenging new web extraction task. PLAtE
focuses on shopping data, specifically extractions from product review pages
with multiple items. PLAtE encompasses both the tasks of: (1) finding
product-list segmentation boundaries and (2) extracting attributes for each
product. PLAtE is composed of 53, 905 items from 6, 810 pages, making it the
first large-scale list page web extraction dataset. We construct PLAtE by
collecting list pages from Common Crawl, then annotating them on Mechanical
Turk. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are performed to demonstrate PLAtE
has high-quality annotations. We establish strong baseline performance on PLAtE
with a SOTA model achieving an F1-score of 0.750 for attribute classification
and 0.915 for segmentation, indicating opportunities for future research
innovations in web extraction.

mitigation. In spite of considerable practical importance, current algorithmic
fairness literature lacks an in-depth understanding of the relations between
different forms of biases. Social bias is complex by nature. Numerous studies
in social psychology identify the ""generalized prejudice"", i.e., generalized
devaluing sentiments across different groups. For example, people who devalue
ethnic minorities are also likely to devalue women and gays. Therefore, this
work aims to provide a first systematic study toward understanding bias

computational models that can better explain human language evolution, the
creation of symbol systems, and the construction of internal representations.
This study provides a new model for emergent communication, which is based on a
probabilistic generative model (PGM) instead of a discriminative model based on
deep reinforcement learning. We define the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) naming game
by generalizing previously proposed models. It is not a referential game with
explicit feedback, as assumed by many emergent communication studies. Instead,
it is a game based on joint attention without explicit feedback.
Mathematically, the MH naming game is proved to be a type of MH algorithm for
an integrative PGM that combines two agents that play the naming game. From
this viewpoint, symbol emergence is regarded as decentralized Bayesian
inference, and semiotic communication is regarded as inter-personal cross-modal
inference. This notion leads to the collective predictive coding hypothesis}
regarding language evolution and, in general, the emergence of symbols. We also
propose the inter-Gaussian mixture model (GMM)+ variational autoencoder (VAE),
a deep generative model for emergent communication based on the MH naming game.
The model has been validated on MNIST and Fruits 360 datasets. Experimental
findings demonstrate that categories are formed from real images observed by
agents, and signs are correctly shared across agents by successfully utilizing
both of the observations of agents via the MH naming game. Furthermore,
scholars verified that visual images were recalled from signs uttered by
agents. Notably, emergent communication without supervision and reward feedback
improved the performance of the unsupervised representation learning of agents.

high-level synthesis (HLS) are completely technology independent making it hard
for designers to interpret how changes in the synthesis options affect the
resultant circuit. FPGA design flows are completely embracing HLS based
methodologies so that software engineers with almost no hardware design skills
can easily use their tools. HLS tools allow design space exploration by
modifying synthesis options, however, they lack accuracy in the Quality of
Results (QoR) reported right after HLS. This lack of correctness results in
sub-optimal designs with problems in timing closure. This paper presents a
robust ML based design flow that can accurately predict post-route QoR for a
given behavioral description without the need to synthesize the design. The
model is an important design exploration tool where a designer can quickly view
the impact on overall design quality when local and global optimization

advantages: (i) Accurate prediction of the design quality (QoR), and (ii)
complete elimination of the need to execute high-level synthesis for each

Relativity theory when a cosmological principle is considered under a flat
space time landscape. The set of known as Friedmann equations, contain the
principles that lead to the construction of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.
However, the current state-of-art regarding these equations, even if it is a
fundamental method, is based in solving analytically the differential equations
by considering several forms of matter/energy components or evaluating them in
specific cosmic times where two or more components contribute at the same rate.
This latter can be carry out through the approach of piecewice solutions, whose
reduce the numerical integrals. In this paper we discuss new solutions through
special analytical functions and constraint them with an updated compilation of
observational Hubble observations in order to deal with the local $H_0$ tension
reported.

the value of a conversion (e.g., a purchase). It not only impacts user
experience by showing relevant ads, but also affects ROI of advertisers and
revenue of marketplaces. Unlike clicks, which often occur within minutes after
impressions, conversions are expected to happen over a long period of time
(e.g., 30 days for online shopping). It creates a challenge, as the true labels
are only available after the long delays. Either inaccurate labels (partial
conversions) are used, or models are trained on stale data (e.g., from 30 days
ago). The problem is more eminent in online learning, which focuses on the live
performance on the latest data. In this paper, a novel solution is presented to
address this challenge using multi-head modeling. Unlike traditional methods,
it directly quantizes conversions into multiple windows, such as day 1, day 2,
day 3-7, and day 8-30. A sub-model is trained specifically on conversions
within each window. Label freshness is maximally preserved in early models
(e.g., day 1 and day 2), while late conversions are accurately utilized in
models with longer delays (e.g., day 8-30). It is shown to greatly exceed the
performance of known methods in online learning experiments for both conversion
rate (CVR) and value per click (VPC) predictions. Lastly, as a general method
for delayed feedback modeling, it can be combined with any advanced ML
techniques to further improve the performance.

model complex systems such as disease dynamics. However, many satellite images
have missing values due to measurement defects, which render them unusable
without data imputation. For example, the scanline corrector for the LANDSAT 7
satellite broke down in 2003, resulting in a loss of around 20\% of its data.
Inpainting involves predicting what is missing based on the known pixels and is
an old problem in image processing, classically based on PDEs or interpolation
methods, but recent deep learning approaches have shown promise. However, many
of these methods do not explicitly take into account the inherent
spatiotemporal structure of satellite images. In this work, we cast satellite
image inpainting as a natural meta-learning problem, and propose using
convolutional neural processes (ConvNPs) where we frame each satellite image as
its own task or 2D regression problem. We show ConvNPs can outperform classical
methods and state-of-the-art deep learning inpainting models on a scanline
inpainting problem for LANDSAT 7 satellite images, assessed on a variety of in

approaches that focus on users' global preferences is not appropriate in this

characteristics which do not necessarily match their long-term or global

performed on a news dataset from a local newspaper show that these local

model evaluation in vFL might also lead to potential leakage of private label

Motivated by regression problems we establish a formula for their area under

an anchored decomposition of $f$. We find an expression for the expected value
of the AUC under a random ordering of inputs to $f$ and propose an alternative
area above a straight line for the regression setting. We use this criterion to
compare feature importances computed by integrated gradients (IG) to those
computed by Kernel SHAP (KS) as well as LIME, DeepLIFT, vanilla gradient and
input$\times$gradient methods. KS has the best overall performance in two
datasets we consider but it is very expensive to compute. We find that IG is
nearly as good as KS while being much faster. Our comparison problems include
some binary inputs that pose a challenge to IG because it must use values
between the possible variable levels and so we consider ways to handle binary
variables in IG. We show that sorting variables by their Shapley value does not
necessarily give the optimal ordering for an insertion-deletion test. It will

designing scalable, coordination-free distributed systems. However,
constructing correct CRDTs is difficult, posing a challenge for even seasoned
developers. As a result, CRDT development is still largely the domain of
academics, with new designs often awaiting peer review and a manual proof of
correctness. In this paper, we present Katara, a program synthesis-based system
that takes sequential data type implementations and automatically synthesizes
verified CRDT designs from them. Key to this process is a new formal definition
of CRDT correctness that combines a reference sequential type with a
lightweight ordering constraint that resolves conflicts between non-commutative
operations. Our process follows the tradition of work in verified lifting,
including an encoding of correctness into SMT logic using synthesized inductive
invariants and hand-crafted grammars for the CRDT state and runtime. Katara is
able to automatically synthesize CRDTs for a wide variety of scenarios, from
reproducing classic CRDTs to synthesizing novel designs based on specifications
in existing literature. Crucially, our synthesized CRDTs are fully,
automatically verified, eliminating entire classes of common errors and
reducing the process of producing a new CRDT from a painstaking paper proof of
correctness to a lightweight specification.

non-stationary environment. The BwK problem generalizes the multi-arm bandit
(MAB) problem to model the resource consumption associated with playing each
arm. At each time, the decision maker/player chooses to play an arm, and s/he
will receive a reward and consume certain amount of resource from each of the
multiple resource types. The objective is to maximize the cumulative reward
over a finite horizon subject to some knapsack constraints on the resources.
Existing works study the BwK problem under either a stochastic or adversarial
environment. Our paper considers a non-stationary environment which
continuously interpolates between these two extremes. We first show that the
traditional notion of variation budget is insufficient to characterize the
non-stationarity of the BwK problem for a sublinear regret due to the presence
of the constraints, and then we propose a new notion of global non-stationarity
measure. We employ both non-stationarity measures to derive upper and lower
bounds for the problem. Our results are based on a primal-dual analysis of the
underlying linear programs and highlight the interplay between the constraints
and the non-stationarity. Finally, we also extend the non-stationarity measure
to the problem of online convex optimization with constraints and obtain new
regret bounds accordingly.

that heavily relies on teacher network predictions to guide the training of a

(PLMs), KD is often adopted in many NLP tasks involving PLMs. However, it is
evident that in KD, deploying the teacher network during training adds to the
memory and computational requirements of training. In the computer vision
literature, the necessity of the teacher network is put under scrutiny by
showing that KD is a label regularization technique that can be replaced with
lighter teacher-free variants such as the label-smoothing technique. However,
to the best of our knowledge, this issue is not investigated in NLP. Therefore,
this work concerns studying different label regularization techniques and
whether we actually need them to improve the fine-tuning of smaller PLM
networks on downstream tasks. In this regard, we did a comprehensive set of
experiments on different PLMs such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT with more than 600
distinct trials and ran each configuration five times. This investigation led
to a surprising observation that KD and other label regularization techniques
do not play any meaningful role over regular fine-tuning when the student model
is pre-trained. We further explore this phenomenon in different settings of NLP
and computer vision tasks and demonstrate that pre-training itself acts as a
kind of regularization, and additional label regularization is unnecessary.

recently been shown to boost performance in several medical imaging tasks.
However, it is unclear how much the pre-trained representation reflects the
primary organ of interest compared to spurious surrounding tissue. In this
work, we evaluate the optimal method of incorporating prior knowledge of
anatomy into a SSCL training paradigm. Specifically, we evaluate using a
segmentation network to explicitly local the heart in CMR images, followed by
SSCL pretraining in multiple diagnostic tasks. We find that using a priori
knowledge of anatomy can greatly improve the downstream diagnostic performance.
Furthermore, SSCL pre-training with in-domain data generally improved
downstream performance and more human-like saliency compared to end-to-end
training and ImageNet pre-trained networks. However, introducing anatomic

propose a novel differential privacy mechanism that samples noise from the

mechanisms, namely the Laplace and the Gaussian mechanisms, the proposed
mechanism uses a bell-shaped distribution that resembles the distribution of
the Gaussian mechanism, and it satisfies pure $\epsilon$-differential privacy
similar to the Laplace mechanism. We apply membership inference attacks on both

La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ using time-domain THz spectroscopy in high magnetic
field has given new possibilities for the study of cuprate superconductors. One
can measure the cyclotron mass in more disordered cuprates possesing short
scattering times therefore expanding the study to materials and dopings in
which quantum oscillations have not been observed. Here we present the
measurement of the carrier mass of the hole doped cuprate
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ across a a range of dopings spanning the slightly
underdoped ($x=0.13$) to highly overdoped ($x=0.26$), near to the termination
of the superconducting dome. These results reveal a systematic increase of
$m_c$ with doping, up to values greater than thirteen times the bare electron
mass. This is in contrast with those masses extracted from the heat capacity,
which show a peak near the pseudogap critical point $p^*$ and/or Lifshitz
transition. The cyclotron frequency is linear in field up to 31 T for all
dopings giving no evidence for field induced Fermi surface reconstructions. The
cyclotron mass is found to be positive for all dopings, but with a magnitude
systematically below the heat capacity mass for under and optimally doped
samples, while exceeding it for overdoped samples. Among other aspects, these
results are surprising as photoemission reveals a Lifshitz transition in the
middle of our doping range and the sign of the cyclotron mass determined from a
finite frequency resonance is -- in conventional theories -- a {\it topological
quantity} only sensitive to whether or not the Fermi surface is closed around
holes or electrons. We see no sign of a divergence of the mass near $p^*$ nor
near the Lifshitz transition, showing that any singularity -- if it exists --
is not strong enough to affect the cyclotron mass.

scale well to this ""high-dimensional"" regime in terms of performance and pilot
overhead. Meanwhile, training deep learning based approaches for channel
estimation requires large labeled datasets mapping pilot measurements to clean
channel realizations, which can only be generated offline using simulated
channels. In this paper, we develop a novel unsupervised over-the-air (OTA)
algorithm that utilizes noisy received pilot measurements to train a deep
generative model to output beamspace MIMO channel realizations. Our approach
leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), while using a conditional
input to distinguish between Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)
channel realizations. We also present a federated implementation of the OTA
algorithm that distributes the GAN training over multiple users and greatly
reduces the user side computation. We then formulate channel estimation from a
limited number of pilot measurements as an inverse problem and reconstruct the
channel by optimizing the input vector of the trained generative model. Our
proposed approach significantly outperforms Orthogonal Matching Pursuit on both
LOS and NLOS channel models, and EM-GM-AMP -- an Approximate Message Passing
algorithm -- on LOS channel models, while achieving comparable performance on
NLOS channel models in terms of the normalized channel reconstruction error.
More importantly, our proposed framework has the potential to be trained online
using real noisy pilot measurements, is not restricted to a specific channel
model and can even be utilized for a federated OTA design of a dataset
generator from noisy data.

positional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii)
global attention mechanism. We provide a modular framework $\textit{GraphGPS}$

textual interactions. In this paper, we present a Gated Interlayer
Collaboration (GIC) mechanism to improve the performance of CTC-based models,
which introduces textual information into the model and thus relaxes the
conditional independence assumption of CTC-based models. Specifically, we
consider the weighted sum of token embeddings as the textual representation for
each position, where the position-specific weights are the softmax probability
distribution constructed via inter-layer auxiliary CTC losses. The textual
representations are then fused with acoustic features by developing a gate
unit. Experiments on AISHELL-1, TEDLIUM2, and AIDATATANG corpora show that the
proposed method outperforms several strong baselines.

expert radiologists to proactively guide the deep model to focus on regions
with potential pathology and avoid being trapped in learning harmful shortcuts.
To do so, we propose a novel eye-gaze-guided vision transformer (EG-ViT) for
diagnosis with limited medical image data. We mask the input image patches that
are out of the radiologists' interest and add an additional residual connection
in the last encoder layer of EG-ViT to maintain the correlations of all
patches. The experiments on two public datasets of INbreast and SIIM-ACR
demonstrate our EG-ViT model can effectively learn/transfer experts' domain

successfully rectifies the harmful shortcut learning and significantly improves
the EG-ViT model's interpretability. In general, EG-ViT takes the advantages of

$SU(2)$ breaking, simply because of the presence of the quantum axial anomaly.
Hence it might be expected that if and only if the QCD gauge coupling is turned
off, or sent to zero (the asymptotic-free limit), where the $U(1)$ axial
anomaly goes away, the strength of the $U(1)$ axial breaking trivially
coincides with that of the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking. In this write-up, we find
that a axial-chiral coincidence occurs even with nonzero QCD gauge coupling,
that is a nontrivial coincidence: it is the case with the massive light quarks
$(m_l\neq 0)$ and the massless strange quark ($m_s=0$), due to the
flavor-singlet nature of the topological susceptibility. This coincidence is
robust and tied with the anomalous chiral Ward-Takahashi identity. The
nontrivial coincidence implies that the $U(1)$ axial anomaly becomes invisible
in the meson susceptibility functions. The invisibility of the $U(1)$ axial
anomaly keeps even at hot QCD, so that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry restores
simultaneously with the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures. This
simultaneous restoration is independent of the light quark mass, hence is
irrespective to the order of the chiral phase transition. We explicitize what
the nontrivial coincidence can tell us, by working on a chiral effective model.
It turns out that once the strange quark mass gets massive, the topological
susceptibility handles the deviation from the nontrivial coincidence. It is
then clarified that the large discrepancy between the chiral and axial
restorations in the $2+1$ flavors with the physical quark masses is brought by
the significant interference of the topological susceptibility. Thus the
deviation from the nontrivial coincidence monitored by the topological
susceptibility provides a new way of understanding of the chiral and axial
breaking in QCD.

quantum applications on near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
computers. Despite a lot of empirical studies and recent progress in
theoretical understanding of VQE's optimization landscape, the convergence for
optimizing VQE is far less understood. We provide the first rigorous analysis
of the convergence of VQEs in the over-parameterization regime. By connecting
the training dynamics with the Riemannian Gradient Flow on the unit-sphere, we
establish a threshold on the sufficient number of parameters for efficient
convergence, which depends polynomially on the system dimension and the
spectral ratio, a property of the problem Hamiltonian, and could be resilient
to gradient noise to some extent. We further illustrate that this
overparameterization threshold could be vastly reduced for specific VQE
instances by establishing an ansatz-dependent threshold paralleling our main
result. We showcase that our ansatz-dependent threshold could serve as a proxy
of the trainability of different VQE ansatzes without performing empirical
experiments, which hence leads to a principled way of evaluating ansatz design.
Finally, we conclude with a comprehensive empirical study that supports our
theoretical findings.

grounded in an image, using the dialog history as context. Prior work has
trained the dialog agents solely on VisDial data via supervised learning or
leveraged pre-training on related vision-and-language datasets. This paper
presents a semi-supervised learning approach for visually-grounded dialog,
called Generative Self-Training (GST), to leverage unlabeled images on the Web.
Specifically, GST first retrieves in-domain images through out-of-distribution
detection and generates synthetic dialogs regarding the images via multimodal
conditional text generation. GST then trains a dialog agent on the synthetic
and the original VisDial data. As a result, GST scales the amount of training
data up to an order of magnitude that of VisDial (1.2M to 12.9M QA data). For
robust training of the synthetic dialogs, we also propose perplexity-based data
selection and multimodal consistency regularization. Evaluation on VisDial v1.0
and v0.9 datasets shows that GST achieves new state-of-the-art results on both
datasets. We further observe the robustness of GST against both visual and
textual adversarial attacks. Finally, GST yields strong performance gains in
the low-data regime. Code is available at

(PIBT) method to make it applicable to more general environments. PIBT is an
effective algorithm that introduces a priority to each agent, and at each
timestep, the agents, in descending order of priority, decide their next
neighboring locations in the next timestep through communications only with the
local agents. Unfortunately, PIBT is only applicable to environments that are
modeled as a bi-connected area, and if it contains dead-ends, such as
tree-shaped paths, PIBT may cause deadlocks. However, in the real-world
environment, there are many dead-end paths to locations such as the shelves
where materials are stored as well as loading/unloading locations to
transportation trucks. Our proposed method enables MAPD tasks to be performed
in environments with some tree-shaped paths without deadlock while preserving
the PIBT feature; it does this by allowing the agents to have temporary
priorities and restricting agents' movements in the trees. First, we
demonstrate that agents can always reach their delivery without deadlock. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method is very efficient, even in
environments where PIBT is not applicable, by comparing them with those
obtained using the well-known token passing method as a baseline.

significant and the conventional Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) equation (without

limit of steady state Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations with steric effects
(PNP-steric equations). By the assumptions of steric effects, we transform
steady state PNP-steric equations into a PB equation with steric effects
(PB-steric equation) which has a parameter $\Lambda$ and positive constants
$\lambda_i$'s (depend on the radii of ions and solvent molecules). The
nonlinear term of PB-steric equation is mainly determined by a Lambert type
function which represents the concentration of solvent molecules. As
$\Lambda=0$, the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation but as
$\Lambda>0$, a large $\Lambda$ makes the steric repulsion (between ions and
solvent molecules) stronger. This motivates us to find the asymptotic limit of
PB-steric equation as $\Lambda$ goes to infinity. Under the Robin (or Neumann)
boundary condition, we prove theoretically and numerically that the PB-steric
equation has a unique solution $\phi_\Lambda$ which converges to solution
$\phi^*$ of a modified PB (mPB) equation as $\Lambda$ tends to infinity. Our
results show that the limiting equation of PB-steric equation (as $\Lambda$
goes to infinity) is a mPB equation which has the same form (up to scalar
multiples) as those mPB equations in

the speed of planning is proportional to the number of elementary operations

operations depends on the number of options composed by the policy in an
episode and the number of options being considered at each decision point. To
reduce the amount of computation in planning, for a given set of episodic tasks

smaller set of options to choose from at each decision point. We develop an
algorithm that optimizes the proposed objective. In a variant of the classic

enhance the state-of-the-art CANDi fiber laser pulse energy from 1 nJ to 8 nJ.
We then introduce a novel reference-free RTJ characterization technique that
provides shot-to-shot measurement capability at femtosecond precision for the
first time. The measurement noise floor reaches 1.6x10-7 fs2/Hz, and the
corresponding integrated measurement precision is only 1.8 fs (1 kHz, 20 MHz).
With this new characterization tool, we are able to study the physical origin

fluctuation does not contribute to the RTJ. Then we measure the integrated RTJ
to be 39 fs (1 kHz, 20 MHz) and identify the pump relative intensity noise
(RIN) to be the dominant factor responsible for it. In particular, pump RIN is
coupled to the RTJ through the Gordon-Haus effect. Finally, solutions to reduce

guideline to improve the performance of compact single-cavity dual-comb systems

as a promising technology for future 6G and beyond wireless systems, to
overcome the challenges of evergrowing wireless data traffic and crowded
spectrum. As the frequency increases from the microwave band to the THz band,
new spectrum features pose unprecedented challenges to wireless communication
system design. The molecular absorption effect is one of the new THz spectrum
properties, which enlarges the path loss and noise at specific frequencies.
This brings in a double-edged sword for THz wireless communication systems. On
one hand, from the data rate viewpoint, molecular absorption is detrimental,
since it mitigates the received signal power and degrades the channel capacity.
On the other hand, it is worth noticing that for wireless security and
covertness, the molecular absorption effect can be utilized to safeguard THz
communications among users. In this paper, the features of the molecular
absorption effect and their impact on the THz system design are analyzed under
various scenarios, with the ultimate goal of providing guidelines to how better
exploit this unique THz phenomenon. Specifically, since the molecular
absorption greatly depends on the propagation medium, different communication
scenarios consisting of various media are discussed, including terrestrial, air
and space, sea surface and nano-scale communications. Furthermore, two novel
molecular absorption enlightened secure and covert communication schemes are
presented, where the molecular absorption effect is utilized as the key and
unique feature to boost security and covertness.

recent progress in speech representation learning. Specifically, a sequence of
discrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from
the model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing
the following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived
from speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic
property (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of
translation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize
autoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence
previously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. In this
work, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with
bilateral perturbation. To alleviate the acoustic multimodal problem, we
propose bilateral perturbation (BiP), which consists of the style normalization
and information enhancement stages, to learn only the linguistic information
from speech samples and generate more deterministic representations. With
reduced multimodality, we step forward and become the first to establish a
non-autoregressive S2ST technique, which repeatedly masks and predicts unit
choices and produces high-accuracy results in just a few cycles. Experimental
results on three language pairs demonstrate that BiP yields an improvement of

performance on various generation tasks. By modeling the reverse process of
gradually diffusing the data distribution into a Gaussian distribution,
generating a sample in DDPMs can be regarded as iteratively denoising a
randomly sampled Gaussian noise. However, in practice DDPMs often need hundreds
even thousands of denoising steps to obtain a high-quality sample from the
Gaussian noise, leading to extremely low inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a principled acceleration strategy, referred to as Early-Stopped DDPM
(ES-DDPM), for DDPMs. The key idea is to stop the diffusion process early where
only the few initial diffusing steps are considered and the reverse denoising
process starts from a non-Gaussian distribution. By further adopting a powerful
pre-trained generative model, such as GAN and VAE, in ES-DDPM, sampling from
the target non-Gaussian distribution can be efficiently achieved by diffusing
samples obtained from the pre-trained generative model. In this way, the number
of required denoising steps is significantly reduced. In the meantime, the
sample quality of ES-DDPM also improves substantially, outperforming both the
vanilla DDPM and the adopted pre-trained generative model. On extensive
experiments across CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Cat,
ES-DDPM obtains promising acceleration effect and performance improvement over
representative baseline methods. Moreover, ES-DDPM also demonstrates several
attractive properties, including being orthogonal to existing acceleration

classifier based on pseudo-labels. The quality of pseudo-labels is crucial to
final performance but they are inevitably noisy due to their heuristic nature,
so selecting the correct ones has a huge potential for performance boost. One

we show through our experiments that such solutions are ineffective and
unstable due to the erroneously high-confidence predictions from poorly

labels and then those with noisy labels. Inspired by this observation, we
propose a novel pseudo-label selection method LOPS that takes learning order of
samples into consideration. We hypothesize that the learning order reflects the
probability of wrong annotation in terms of ranking, and therefore, propose to
select the samples that are learnt earlier. LOPS can be viewed as a strong

parameters the chirp mass ($M_c$), the symmetric mass ratio ($\eta$), and the
tidal deformability ($\tilde{\lambda}$). By comparing the results between the
Bayesian and the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) methods, we obtain the
valid criteria for the FCV approach. Employing the FCV method and using the
realistic population of binary neutron star sources distributed in the
$m_1$-$m_2$-$e_0$ space, where $e_0$ indicates the eccentricity at 10Hz, we
calculate the measurement errors ($\sigma_{\theta}$) and the systematic biases
($\Delta \theta/\sigma_{\theta}$) and obtain their generalized distributions in
the range of $0 \leq e_0 \leq 0.025$. We find that for all of the three
parameters, the biases increase with increasing $e_0$, and this increase is
faster for larger $e_0$. The bias is mainly dependent on the value of $e_0$ and
weakly dependent on the component masses, and thus the distribution shows a
narrow band in the $e_0$-$\Delta \theta/\sigma_{\theta}$ plane. We present
various posterior examples to illustrate our new findings, such as the
bimodality of posteriors. In particular, we give a specific injection-recovery
example to demonstrate the importance of including eccentricity in parameter

routed to the intended target(s) for timely responses. However, the huge volume
and diverse types of crisis-related posts on social media might limit
help-seeking requests to receive adequate engagement and lead to their
overwhelm. To understand this problem, this work proposes a mixed-methods
approach to figure out the overwhelm situation of help-seeking requests, and
individuals' and online communities' strategies to cope. We focused on the 2021
Henan Floods in China and collected 141,674 help-seeking posts with the keyword
""Henan Rainstorm Mutual Aid"" on a popular Chinese social media platform Weibo.
The findings indicate that help-seeking posts confront critical challenges of
both external overwhelm (i.e., an enormous number of non-help-seeking posts
with the help-seeking-related keyword distracting public attention) and
internal overwhelm (i.e., attention inequality with 5% help-seeking posts
receiving more than 95% likes, comments, and shares). We discover linguistic
and non-linguistic help-seeking strategies that could help to prevent the
overwhelm, such as including contact information, disclosing situational
vulnerabilities, using subjective narratives, and structuring help-seeking
posts to a normalized syntax. We also illustrate how community members
spontaneously work to prevent the overwhelm with their collective wisdom (e.g.,
norm development through discussion) and collaborative work (e.g.,
cross-community support). We reflect on how the findings enrich the literature

semimetal (WSM) nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated. The numerical results show
that negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC) effect can be obtained in
this system, i.e., when the temperature of the emitter is fixed, the heat flux
does not decrease monotonically with the increase of the temperature of the
receiver. Specifically, when the temperature of the emitter is 300 K, the heat
flux is identical when the temperature of the receiver is 50 K or 280 K. The
NDTC effect is attributed to the fact that the permittivity of the WSMs changes
with the temperature. The coupling effects of polarizability of two WSM NPs
have been further identified at different temperature to reveal the physical
mechanism of the NDTC effect. In addition, the NFRHT between two Weyl WSM NPs
can be greatly enhanced by exciting the localized plasmon and circular modes.
This work indicates that the WSMs maybe promising candidate materials for
manipulating NFRHT.

(e.g., embeddings) which falls short of interpretability, reusability across
LMs, and applicability when gradients are not accessible. Discrete prompt, on
the other hand, is difficult to optimize, and is often created by ""enumeration
(e.g., paraphrasing)-then-selection"" heuristics that do not explore the prompt
space systematically. This paper proposes RLPrompt, an efficient discrete
prompt optimization approach with reinforcement learning (RL). RLPrompt
formulates a parameter-efficient policy network that generates the desired
discrete prompt after training with reward. To overcome the complexity and
stochasticity of reward signals by the large LM environment, we incorporate
effective reward stabilization that substantially enhances the training
efficiency. RLPrompt is flexibly applicable to different types of LMs, such as
masked (e.g., BERT) and left-to-right models (e.g., GPTs), for both
classification and generation tasks. Experiments on few-shot classification and
unsupervised text style transfer show superior performance over a wide range of
existing finetuning or prompting methods. Interestingly, the resulting
optimized prompts are often ungrammatical gibberish text; and surprisingly,
those gibberish prompts are transferrable between different LMs to retain
significant performance, indicating LM prompting may not follow human language
patterns.

Transformers (ViTs), have been shown to improve the performance of ViTs on many

since the spatial information of the input patches is exposed. This caveat
naturally raises a series of interesting questions about the impact of PEs on
the accuracy, privacy, prediction consistency, etc. To tackle these issues, we
propose a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) position embedding method. In particular,
MJP first shuffles the selected patches via our block-wise random jigsaw puzzle
shuffle algorithm, and their corresponding PEs are occluded. Meanwhile, for the
non-occluded patches, the PEs remain the original ones but their spatial
relation is strengthened via our dense absolute localization regressor. The
experimental results reveal that 1) PEs explicitly encode the 2D spatial
relationship and lead to severe privacy leakage problems under gradient
inversion attack; 2) Training ViTs with the naively shuffled patches can
alleviate the problem, but it harms the accuracy; 3) Under a certain shuffle
ratio, the proposed MJP not only boosts the performance and robustness on
large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-C, -A/O) but also improves
the privacy preservation ability under typical gradient attacks by a large

process for treatment of wastewater takes place in secondary settling tanks
that follow biological reactors. It is therefore of interest to develop models
of so-called reactive settling that describe the spatial variability of
reaction rates caused by the variation of local concentration of biomass due to
hindered settling and compression. A reactive-settling model described by a
system of nonlinear partial differential equations and a numerical scheme are
introduced for the simulation of hindered settling of flocculated particles,
compression at high concentrations, dispersion of the flocculated particles in
the suspension, dispersion of the dissolved substrates in the fluid, and the
mixing that occurs near the feed inlet. The model is fitted to experiments from
a pilot plant where the sedimentation tank has a varying cross-sectional area.
For the reactions, a modified version of the activated sludge model no. 1
(ASM1) is used with standard coefficients. The constitutive functions for
hindered settling and compression are adjusted to a series of conventional
batch settling experiments after the initial induction period of turbulence and
reflocculation has been transformed away. Further (but not substantial)
improvements of prediction of experimental steady-state scenarios can be
achieved by also fitting additional terms modelling hydrodynamic dispersion.

resource -- represented by a cake, $[0,1]$ -- among $n$ agents. This work
considers an interesting variant of the problem where agents are embedded on a
graph. The graphical constraint entails that each agent evaluates her allocated
share only against her neighbor's share. Given a graph, the goal is to
efficiently find a locally envy-free allocation where every agent values her
share to be at least as much as any of her neighbor's share.
  The best known algorithm (by Aziz and Mackenzie) for finding envy-free cake
divisions has a hyper-exponential query complexity. One of the key technical
contributions of this work is to identify a non-trivial graph structure -- tree
graphs with depth at-most two (Depth2Tree) -- on $n$ agents that admits a query
efficient cake-cutting protocol (under the Robertson-Webb query model). In
particular, we develop a discrete protocol that finds a locally envy-free
allocation among $n$ agents on depth-two trees with at-most $O(n^3 \log(n))$
cuts on the cake. For the special case of Depth2Tree where every non-root agent
is connected to at-most two agents (2-Star), we show that $O(n^2)$ queries
suffice. We complement our algorithmic results with establishing a lower bound
of $\Omega(n^2)$ (evaluation) queries for finding a locally envy-free
allocation among $n$ agents on a 1-Star graph (under the assumption that the
root agent partitions the cake into $n$ connected pieces).

studies of the neutron pairing energies $-E_{\rm pair}$ shown that values of
the odd-$A$ nuclei are much smaller in comparison with those of the neighboring
even-even nuclei due to the absent contribution of pairing energy by the
unpaired odd neutron. By investigating the single-particle structures, the rms

neutron-rich Ca, Ni, and Sn isotopes are predicted, in which the sharp
increases of rms radii with significant deviations from the traditional

arising from a two-state fluctuator, described by random telegraph process, and
a noise probe which is also a qubit, a so-called spectator qubit (SQ). We
construct the theoretical model assuming projective measurements on the SQ, and
derive the performance of different measurement and control strategies in the

in the immediate future. We show numerically that this algorithm works very
well, and find that its adaptive strategy can be well approximated by a simpler
algorithm with just a few parameters. Based on this, and an analytical
construction using Bayesian maps, we design a one-parameter ($\Theta$) family
of algorithms. In the asymptotic regime of high noise-sensitivity of the SQ, we
show analytically that this $\Theta$-family of algorithms reduces the data
qubit decoherence rate by a divisor scaling as the square of this sensitivity.
Setting $\Theta$ equal to its optimal value, $\Theta^\star$, yields the
Map-based Optimized Adaptive Algorithm for Asymptotic Regime (MOAAAR). We show,

it is important to know whether global observable estimates, such as the total
mass and size of the cloud, can give an accurate estimation of various key
physical quantities that characterize the dynamics of the cloud. Of prime
importance is the correct determination of the total gravitational (binding)
energy and virial parameter of a cloud. We show that, whereas for clouds that

the knowledge of only their mass and size is sufficient to yield an accurate
determination of the aforementioned quantities from observations (i.e. in real

paramagnetic resonance measurements reveals an abundance of related but so far
unidentified signals. In this study, we search for defects in 4H-SiC that
explain the above magneto-optical signals in a defect database generated by
Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) workflows. This search
reveals only one class of atomic structures that exhibit silicon-vacancy-like
properties in the data: a carbon antisite ($\mathrm{C_{Si}}$) within
sub-nanometer distances from the silicon vacancy only slightly alters the
latter without affecting the charge or spin state. Such a perturbation is
energetically bound. We consider the formation of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^-+C_{Si}}$ up
to 2 nm distance and report their zero phonon lines and zero field splitting

in the silicon vacancy region and find an abundance of lines. Comparing our

agreement. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of a database with
high-throughput results in the search for defects in quantum applications.

switch between these modes during run-time. The ODRG unit adds less than 11% of
a core's area for a three-core group, or a total of 1% of the cluster area, and
shows negligible timing increase, which compares favorably to a commercial
state-of-the-art implementation, and is 2.5$\times$ faster in fault recovery
re-synchronization. Furthermore, unlike other implementations, when redundancy
is not necessary, the ODRG approach allows the redundant cores to be used for
independent computation, allowing up to 2.96$\times$ increase in performance

important but challenging computer vision problem. In addition to the
individual body mesh models, we need to estimate relative 3D positions among
subjects to generate a coherent representation. In this work, through a single
graph neural network, named MUG (Multi-hUman Graph network), we construct
coherent multi-human meshes using only multi-human 2D pose as input. Compared
with existing methods, which adopt a detection-style pipeline (i.e., extracting
image features and then locating human instances and recovering body meshes
from that) and suffer from the significant domain gap between lab-collected
training datasets and in-the-wild testing datasets, our method benefits from
the 2D pose which has a relatively consistent geometric property across
datasets. Our method works like the following: First, to model the multi-human
environment, it processes multi-human 2D poses and builds a novel heterogeneous
graph, where nodes from different people and within one person are connected to
capture inter-human interactions and draw the body geometry (i.e., skeleton and
mesh structure). Second, it employs a dual-branch graph neural network
structure -- one for predicting inter-human depth relation and the other one
for predicting root-joint-relative mesh coordinates. Finally, the entire
multi-human 3D meshes are constructed by combining the output from both
branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG outperforms previous
multi-human mesh estimation methods on standard 3D human benchmarks --
Panoptic, MuPoTS-3D and 3DPW.

stego media which can be transmitted on public channels without drawing
suspicion. As its countermeasure, steganalysis mainly aims to detect whether
the secret message is hidden in a given media. Although the steganography
techniques are improving constantly, the sophisticated steganalysis can always
break a known steganographic method to some extent. With a stego media
discovered, the adversary could find out the sender or receiver and coerce them
to disclose the secret message, which we name as coercive attack in this paper.
Inspired by the idea of deniable encryption, we build up the concepts of
deniable steganography for the first time and discuss the feasible
constructions for it. As an example, we propose a receiver-deniable
steganographic scheme to deal with the receiver-side coercive attack using deep
neural networks (DNN). Specifically, besides the real secret message, a piece
of fake message is also embedded into the cover. On the receiver side, the real
message can be extracted with an extraction module; while once the receiver has
to surrender a piece of secret message under coercive attack, he can extract
the fake message to deceive the adversary with another extraction module.
Experiments demonstrate the scalability and sensitivity of the DNN-based
receiver-deniable steganographic scheme.

electrostatic potential step of height $V_{0}$ with a positive incoming energy
that tends to the limit point of the so-called Klein energy zone, i.e.,
$E\rightarrow V_{0}-\mathrm{m}c^{2}$, for a given $V_{0}$. In such a case, the
particle is actually colliding with an impenetrable barrier. In fact,
$V_{0}\rightarrow E+\mathrm{m}c^{2}$, for a given relativistic energy
$E\,(<V_{0})$, is the maximum value that the height of the step can reach and
that ensures the perfect impenetrability of the barrier. Nevertheless, we note
that, unlike the nonrelativistic case, the entire eigensolution does not
completely vanish, either at the barrier or in the region under the step, but
its upper component does satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition at the
barrier. More importantly, by calculating the mean value of the force exerted
by the impenetrable wall on the particle in this eigenstate and taking its
nonrelativistic limit, we recover the required result. We use two different
approaches to obtain the latter two results. In one of these approaches, the
corresponding force on the particle is a type of boundary quantum force.
Throughout the article, various issues related to the Klein energy zone, the
transmitted solutions to this problem, and impenetrable barriers related to
boundary conditions are also discussed. In particular, if the negative-energy
transmitted solution is used, the lower component of the scattering solution
satisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition at the barrier, but the mean value
of the external force when $V_{0}\rightarrow E+\mathrm{m}c^{2}$ does not seem
to be compatible with the existence of the impenetrable barrier.

controlled system in the presence of transient perturbations and uncertainties
in the initial conditions. The density dynamics are described by a linear
elliptic advection-diffusion equation in which the control enters bilinearly
into the advection term. The well-posedness of the state problem is ensured by
an integral constraint. We prove the existence of optimal controls by embedding
the state constraint into the weak formulation of the state dynamics. The
resulting control field is space-dependent and does not require any
communication between robots or costly density estimation algorithms. Based on
the properties of the primal and dual systems, we first propose a method to

biases as shortcuts to make decision, rather than understand the tasks, which
results in failures on the real-world applications. In this work, we focus on
the spurious correlation between feature and label, which derive from the
biased data distribution in the training data, and analyze it concretely. In
particular, we define the word highly co-occurring with a specific label as
biased word, and the example containing biased word as biased example. Our
analysis reveals that the biased examples with spurious correlations are easier
for models to learn, and when predicting, the biased words make significantly
higher contributions to models' predictions than other words, and the models
tend to assign the labels over-relying on the spurious correlation between
words and labels. To mitigate the model's over-reliance on the shortcut, we
propose a training strategy Less-Learn-Shortcut (LLS): we quantify the biased

into conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks to create
acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. Although it led to significant
improvements in ASRs' recognition accuracy, due to their hard constraints
related to hardware requirements (e.g., computing power and memory usage), it
is unclear if such approaches are the most computationally- and
energy-efficient options for embedded ASR applications. Reservoir computing
(RC) models (e.g., echo state networks (ESNs) and liquid state machines
(LSMs)), on the other hand, have been proven inexpensive to train, have vastly
fewer parameters, and are compatible with emergent hardware technologies.
However, their performance in speech processing tasks is relatively inferior to
that of the deep-learning-based models. To enhance the accuracy of the RC in
ASR applications, we propose heterogeneous single and multi-layer ESNs to
create non-linear transformations of the inputs that capture temporal context
at different scales. To test our models, we performed a speech recognition task
on the Farsdat Persian dataset. Since, to the best of our knowledge, standard
RC has not yet been employed to conduct any Persian ASR tasks, we also trained
conventional single-layer and deep ESNs to provide baselines for comparison.
Besides, we compared the RC performance with a standard long-short-term memory
(LSTM) model. Heterogeneous RC models (1) show improved performance to the
standard RC models; (2) perform on par in terms of recognition accuracy with
the LSTM, and (3) reduce the training time considerably.

with $n$ nodes, and in every time step, a scheduler samples an edge of the
graph uniformly at random and the nodes connected by this edge interact. A
fundamental task in this model is stable leader election, in which all nodes
start in an identical state and the aim is to reach a configuration in which
(1) exactly one node is elected as leader and (2) this node remains as the
unique leader no matter what sequence of interactions follows. On cliques, the
complexity of this problem has recently been settled: time-optimal protocols
stabilize in $\Theta(n \log n)$ expected steps using $\Theta(\log \log n)$
states, whereas protocols that use $O(1)$ states require $\Theta(n^2)$ expected
steps.
  In this work, we investigate the complexity of stable leader election on
general graphs. We provide the first non-trivial time lower bounds for leader
election on general graphs, showing that, when moving beyond cliques, the
complexity landscape of leader election becomes very diverse: the time required
to elect a leader can range from $O(1)$ to $\Theta(n^3)$ expected steps. On the
upper bound side, we first observe that there exists a protocol that is
time-optimal on many graph families, but uses polynomially-many states. In
contrast, we give a near-time-optimal protocol that uses only $O(\log^2n)$
states that is at most a factor $\log n$ slower. Finally, we show that the
constant-state protocol of Beauquier et al. [OPODIS 2013] is at most a factor
$n \log n$ slower than the fast polynomial-state protocol. Moreover, among
constant-state protocols, this protocol has near-optimal average case
complexity on dense random graphs.

directly learns the spatial relationships in the 3D voxel space in an
end-to-end fashion. The aggregated 3D features are passed through 3D
convolutions before being flattened into sequential embeddings and fed into a
transformer. A residual structure is designed to further improve the
performance. In addition, the sparse Sinkhorn attention is empowered to reduce
the memory cost, which is a major bottleneck for volumetric representations,
while also achieving excellent performance. The output of the transformer is
again concatenated with 3D convolutional features by a residual design. The

in view of the difficulties of developing realistic force fields and the
intrinsic computational complexity of sampling rare conformational transitions.
To tackle both these issues, we extend to RNA an enhanced path sampling method
previously successfully applied to proteins. In this scheme, the information
about the RNA's native structure is harnessed by a soft history-dependent
biasing force, which is added to the atomistic force field, thus promoting the
generation of productive folding trajectories. Here, we report on the results
of simulations in explicit solvent of RNA molecules from 20 to 47 nucleotides
long and increasing topological complexity. From a statistical analysis of the
folding pathways we infer that, differently from proteins, the underlying free
energy landscape is significantly frustrated, even for relatively small chains
with a simple topology. The folding mechanism and the thermodynamics are in
agreement with the available experiments and some of the existing
coarse-grained models. This scheme provides a fully microscopic
characterization of RNA folding, relating the kinetics and dynamics of the
transition to the chemistry of the chain and its solvent. Therefore, it
provides a transferable framework that sets the stage for future translational
applications.

However, an augmentation strategy that has a high diversity usually introduces

impair the performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose ReSmooth, a
framework that firstly detects OOD samples in augmented samples and then
leverages them. To be specific, we first use a Gaussian mixture model to fit

we can make better use of the diverse augmented data. Further, we incorporate
our ReSmooth framework with negative data augmentation strategies. By properly
handling their intentionally created OOD samples, the classification

MeV to be realized at the applied physics area of the Mainz Microtron MAMI.
Positrons will be created after pair conversion of bremsstrahlung, produced by
the 855 MeV electron beam af MAMI in a tungsten converter target. From the two
conceivable geometries (i) pair conversion in the bremsstrahlung converter
target itself, and (ii) bremsstrahlung pair conversion in a separated lead
foil, the former was considered in detail. Positrons will be energy selected
within an outside open electron beam-line bending magnet, and bent back by an
additional sector magnet. Magnetic focusing elements in between are designed to
prepare in a well shielded positron target chamber about 6 m away from the
target a beam with horizontal and vertical emittances of epsilon_v = 0.055 pi
mm mrad (1 sigma), and epsilon_h = 0.12 pi mm mrad (1 sigma), respectively, for
a 10 micro m thick amorphous tungsten target and negligible momentum spread. At
an accepted positron band width of 1 MeV, spots are expected vertically with an
angular spread of 0.064 mrad and a size of 5.0 mm (FWHM), and horizontally with
an angular spread of 0.64 mrad and a size of 7.7 mm (FWHM). The positron yield
amounts to 13.1 per second, 1 MeV positron energy band width, and 1 nA electron
beam current.

to be $n=384559$. The trap velocity $\Omega$ being the Langrange multiplier
associated with the angular momentum $L_{z}$ for the rotating systems, the
$L_{z}-\Omega$ phase diagram (or stability line) is drawn which determines the
critical angular velocities, $\Omega_{\bf c_{i}}, i=1,2..$, at which, for a
given angular momentum $L_{z}$, the system goes through a quantum phase
transition. %condensate fraction, von-Neumann entropy exhibit abrupt %(quantum

mechanical coherence extends over more and more particles in the system

in the critical angular velocity $\left(\Omega_{\textbf{c}_{i}},

calculated using single particle reduced density matrix(SPRDM) eigen-values
with increase in the interaction range $\sigma$. We calculated the von-Neumann
quantum entropy ($S_{1}$), degree of condensation ($C_{d}$) and the conditional

to cross-modality attention mechanisms. However, in deliberative reasoning such
as in VQA, attention is unconstrained at each step, and thus may serve as a
statistical pooling mechanism rather than a semantic operation intended to
select information relevant to inference. This is because at training time,
attention is only guided by a very sparse signal (i.e. the answer label) at the
end of the inference chain. This causes the cross-modality attention weights to
deviate from the desired visual-language bindings. To rectify this deviation,
we propose to guide the attention mechanism using explicit linguistic-visual
grounding. This grounding is derived by connecting structured linguistic
concepts in the query to their referents among the visual objects. Here we
learn the grounding from the pairing of questions and images alone, without the
need for answer annotation or external grounding supervision. This grounding
guides the attention mechanism inside VQA models through a duality of
mechanisms: pre-training attention weight calculation and directly guiding the
weights at inference time on a case-by-case basis. The resultant algorithm is
capable of probing attention-based reasoning models, injecting relevant
associative knowledge, and regulating the core reasoning process. This scalable
enhancement improves the performance of VQA models, fortifies their robustness
to limited access to supervised data, and increases interpretability.

have to resort to an encoding. Encodings, such as written language, usually

beyond the basic rules of a mathematical formalism such as an algebra. Here we
give a formal definition of a semantic embedding in a semilattice which can be
used to resolve machine learning and classic computer science problems.
Specifically, a semantic embedding of a problem is here an encoding of the

semilattices. We use the recently introduced formalism of finite atomized
semilattices to study the properties of the embeddings and their finite models.
For a problem embedded in a semilattice, we show that every solution has a

the fine-grained HPE and the object-level localization. To this end, we propose
a customized transformer framework to mine the fine-grained representation of

Bernoulli problem, a prototypical model of stationary free boundary problems.
The idea of the method is to transform the overdetermined problem to a complex
boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition coupling the
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the free boundary. Then, we
optimize the cost function constructed by the imaginary part of the solution in
the whole domain in order to identify the free boundary. We also prove the

mild regularity assumption on the domain. We then examine the instability of
the proposed method by proving the compactness of the latter expression. Also,
we devise an iterative algorithm based on a Sobolev gradient scheme via finite
element method to solve the minimization problem. Finally, we illustrate the
applicability of the method through several numerical examples, both in two and

bacterial epidemiology, but reported data across different settings remain
under-integrated in common theoretical frameworks. Pneumococcus serotype
co-colonization, caused by the polymorphic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae,
has been increasingly investigated in recent years. While the global genomic
diversity and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae are well-characterized,
there is limited information on how co-colonization patterns vary globally,
critical for understanding bacterial evolution and dynamics. Gathering a rich
dataset of cross-sectional pneumococcal colonization studies in the literature,
we quantified patterns of transmission intensity and co-colonization prevalence
in children populations across 17 geographic locations. Fitting these data to
an SIS model with co-colonization under the assumption of similarity among
interacting strains, our analysis reveals strong patterns of negative
co-variation between transmission intensity ($R_0$) and susceptibility to
co-colonization ($k$). In support of the stress-gradient hypothesis in ecology
(SGH), pneumococcus serotypes appear to compete more in high-transmission
settings and less in low-transmission settings, a trade-off which ultimately
leads to a conserved ratio of single to co-colonization $\mu=1/(R_0-1)k$.
Within our mathematical model, such conservation suggests preservation of
'stability-diversity-complexity' regimes in multi-strain coexistence. We find
no major study differences in serotype composition, pointing to underlying
adaptation of the same set of serotypes across environments. Our work
highlights that understanding pneumococcus transmission patterns from global
epidemiological data can benefit from simple analytical approaches that account
for quasi-neutrality among strains, co-colonization, as well as variable
environmental adaptation.

The challenge aims at estimating an HDR image from multiple respective low
dynamic range (LDR) observations, which might suffer from under- or
over-exposed regions and different sources of noise. The challenge is composed
of two tracks with an emphasis on fidelity and complexity constraints: In Track
1, participants are asked to optimize objective fidelity scores while imposing
a low-complexity constraint (i.e. solutions can not exceed a given number of
operations). In Track 2, participants are asked to minimize the complexity of
their solutions while imposing a constraint on fidelity scores (i.e. solutions
are required to obtain a higher fidelity score than the prescribed baseline).
Both tracks use the same data and metrics: Fidelity is measured by means of
PSNR with respect to a ground-truth HDR image (computed both directly and with
a canonical tonemapping operation), while complexity metrics include the number
of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and runtime (in seconds).

enhancement capable of improving the quality of digital images. The method
combines tree search theory, and in particular the Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) algorithm, with deep reinforcement learning. Given as input a low-light
image, TreEnhance produces as output its enhanced version together with the
sequence of image editing operations used to obtain it. During the training
phase, the method repeatedly alternates two main phases: a generation phase,
where a modified version of MCTS explores the space of image editing operations
and selects the most promising sequence, and an optimization phase, where the
parameters of a neural network, implementing the enhancement policy, are
updated.
  Two different inference solutions are proposed for the enhancement of new
images: one is based on MCTS and is more accurate but more time and memory
consuming; the other directly applies the learned policy and is faster but
slightly less precise. As a further contribution, we propose a guided search
strategy that ""reverses"" the enhancement procedure that a photo editor applied

TreEnhance does not pose any constraint on the image resolution and can be used

annotated entity labels and biased training, existing entity typing models are
subject to the problem of spurious correlations. To comprehensively investigate
the faithfulness and reliability of entity typing methods, we first
systematically define distinct kinds of model biases that are reflected mainly
from spurious correlations. Particularly, we identify six types of existing
model biases, including mention-context bias, lexical overlapping bias, named
entity bias, pronoun bias, dependency bias, and overgeneralization bias. To
mitigate model biases, we then introduce a counterfactual data augmentation
method. By augmenting the original training set with their debiased
counterparts, models are forced to fully comprehend sentences and discover the
fundamental cues for entity typing, rather than relying on spurious
correlations for shortcuts. Experimental results on the UFET dataset show our
counterfactual data augmentation approach helps improve generalization of
different entity typing models with consistently better performance on both the
original and debiased test sets.

relaxes to the infinite temperature state. In particular, for sufficiently
strong static disorder we observe the onset of metastability, which becomes
more prominent the stronger the spatial correlations of the noise. In this
regime we find that the imbalance decays as a stretched-exponential - a
behavior characteristic of glassy systems. We identify a simple scaling

of the noise correlation length. We discuss how our results could be exploited

but still suffer from a common dilemma: redundant representations (e.g.,
multiple boxes, grids, and anchor points) are inferred for one instance, which
leads to multiple duplicated predictions. Thus, mainstream methods usually rely
on a hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing step to select
the optimal prediction result, which hinders end-to-end training. To address
this issue, we propose a box-free and NMS-free end-to-end instance segmentation
framework, termed UniInst, that yields only one unique representation for each
instance. Specifically, we design an instance-aware one-to-one assignment
scheme, namely Only Yield One Representation (OYOR), which dynamically assigns
one unique representation to each instance according to the matching quality
between predictions and ground truths. Then, a novel prediction re-ranking
strategy is elegantly integrated into the framework to address the misalignment
between the classification score and the mask quality, enabling the learned
representation to be more discriminative. With these techniques, our UniInst,
the first FCN-based box-free and NMS-free instance segmentation framework,
achieves competitive performance, e.g., 39.0 mask AP using ResNet-50-FPN and
40.2 mask AP using ResNet-101-FPN, against mainstream methods on COCO test-dev
2017. Moreover, the proposed instance-aware method is robust to occlusion
scenes, outperforming common baselines by remarkable mask AP on the
heavily-occluded OCHuman benchmark. Code is available at

zero-shot cross-lingual generation. Our experiments show that
parameter-efficient prompt tuning provides gains over standard fine-tuning when
transferring between less-related languages, e.g., from English to Thai.
However, a significant gap still remains between these methods and
fully-supervised baselines. To improve cross-lingual transfer further, we
explore several approaches, including: (1) mixing in unlabeled multilingual

components. Our approaches can provide further quality gains, suggesting that
robust zero-shot cross-lingual generation is within reach.

PromptRank first constructs an instruction-based prompt that includes a
candidate document path and then computes the relevance score between a given
question and the path based on the conditional likelihood of the question given
the path prompt according to a language model. PromptRank yields strong
retrieval performance on HotpotQA with only 128 training examples compared to
state-of-the-art methods trained on thousands of examples -- 73.6 recall@10 by

make decisions and judgments about them. Although such heuristics can be useful
when decisions must be made quickly, or when information is lacking, they can
also serve as the basis for prejudice and discrimination. In this paper we
study the evolution of stereotypes through group reciprocity. We characterize
the warmth of a stereotype as the willingness to cooperate with an individual
based solely on the identity of the group they belong to. We show that when
stereotypes are coarse, such group reciprocity is less likely to evolve, and
stereotypes tend to be negative. We also show that, even when stereotypes are
broadly positive, individuals are often overly pessimistic about the
willingness of those they stereotype to cooperate. We then show that the
tendency for stereotyping itself to evolve is driven by the costs of cognition,
so that more people are stereotyped with greater coarseness as costs increase.
Finally we show that extrinsic ""shocks"", in which the benefits of cooperation
are suddenly reduced, can cause stereotype warmth and judgement bias to turn
sharply negative, consistent with the view that economic and other crises are
drivers of out-group animosity.

insufficient capacity and interference between unrelated languages. Instead, we
move away from this approach and focus on training multiple language (family)

equilibria (steady-states) under otherwise identical conditions, and it is a
phenomenon of recognized importance for biochemical systems. Multistationarity
may appear in the parameter space as a consequence of saddle-node bifurcations,
which necessarily require a simple eigenvalue zero of the Jacobian, at the
bifurcating equilibrium. Matrices with a simple eigenvalue zero are generic in
the set of singular matrices: any system whose Jacobian has an algebraically
multiple eigenvalue zero can be perturbed to a system whose Jacobian has a
simple eigenvalue zero. Thus, one would expect that in applications singular
Jacobians are always with a simple eigenvalue zero. However, chemical reaction
networks typically consider a fixed network structure, while the freedom rests
with the various and different choices of kinetics. Here we present an example
of a chemical reaction network, whose Jacobian is either nonsingular or has an
algebraically multiple eigenvalue zero. The structural obstruction to the
simplicity of the eigenvalue zero is based on the network alone, and it is
independent of the value of concentrations and the choice of kinetics. This in

the deployment of advanced solutions for connecting UAVs and using them as

constraints and scheduling challenges in the dynamic management of network
devices, due to the need to call back and recharge, or substitute, UAVs that
run out of energy. In this paper, we design UAV recharging schemes under
realistic assumptions on limited flight times and time consuming charging
operations. Such schemes are designed to minimize the size of the fleet to be
devoted to a persistent service of a set of aerial locations, hence its cost.
We consider a fleet of homogeneous UAVs both under homogeneous and
heterogeneous service topologies. For UAVs serving aerial locations with
homogeneous distances to a recharge station, we design a simple scheduling,
that we name HORR, which we prove to be feasible and optimal, in the sense that
it uses the minimum possible number of UAVs to guarantee the coverage of the
aerial service locations. For the case of non-evenly distributed aerial
locations, we demonstrate that the problem becomes NP-hard, and design a
lightweight recharging scheduling scheme, PHERR, that extends the operation of
HORR to the heterogeneous case, leveraging the partitioning of the set of
service locations. We show that PHERR is near-optimal because it approaches the
performance limits identified through a lower bound that we formulate on the

of a ""hidden order"" of Dirac (polar) multipoles. The Dirac dipole, known as an
anapole or toroidal dipole, is one of a family of electronic multipoles visible
in x-ray and magnetic neutron diffraction while undetectable with standard
laboratory-based techniques. Two plausible hidden orders are studied with a
view to testing in future x-ray and neutron Bragg diffraction experiments
whether they are trustworthy. One candidate is magneto-electric and restricted
to the linear type, while the other candidate cannot show a magneto-electric
effect of any type. The latter hosts a vanadium entity that is both a true
scalar and magnetic, and its presence epitomizes an absence of loop currents.
Diffraction patterns for the two proposed hidden magnetic orders are distinctly
different, fortunately. Corresponding scattering amplitudes for resonant x-ray

${\alpha_{T/4}} $, proves to be an effective method of combining heave
amplitude ($h_0/c$), pitch amplitude ($\theta_0$), and reduced frequency
($f^*$) into a single variable that predicts the maximum value of $Q$ over a
wide range of operating conditions. Once the LEV separates from the foil, it
travels downstream and rapidly weakens and diffuses. The downstream trajectory
of the LEV has two characteristic shapes. At low values of ${\alpha_{T/4}}$, it
travels straight downstream after separating from the foil, while at higher
values of ${\alpha_{T/4}} $, an accompanying Trailing Edge Vortex (TEV) forms
and the induced velocity generates a cross-stream component to the vortex
trajectories. This behavior is accurately predicted using a potential flow
model for the LEV and TEV. Supervised machine learning algorithms, namely
Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression, are used to create
regression models that predicts the vortex strength, shape and trajectory

the features of two vortex regimes observed at different values of

Therefore developing efficient methods to compute the voltage and current
fluctuations in such non-linear electronic circuits is essential. Traditional
approaches commonly rely on adding Gaussian white noise to the macroscopic
dynamical circuit laws, but do not capture rare fluctuations and lead to
thermodynamic inconsistencies. A correct and thermodynamically consistent
approach can be achieved by describing single-electron transfers as Poisson
jump processes accounting for charging effects. But such descriptions can be
computationally demanding. To address this issue, we consider the macroscopic
limit which corresponds to scaling up the physical dimensions of the transistor
and resulting in an increase of the number of electrons on the conductors. In
this limit, the thermal fluctuations satisfy a Large Deviations Principle which
we show is also remarkably precise in settings involving only a few tens of
electrons, by comparing our results with Gillespie simulations and spectral
methods. Traditional approaches are recovered by resorting to an ad hoc
diffusive approximation introducing inconsistencies. To illustrate these
findings, we consider a low-power CMOS inverter, or NOT gate, which is a basic
primitive in electronic design. Voltage (resp. current) fluctuations are
obtained analytically (semi-analytically) and reveal interesting features.

evaluation of the computational models, and deep neural network (DNN) based
proxies can be useful to address this computational bottleneck. This paper
studies the effects of the approximate nature of the deep learned models and
associated model errors during the inversion of extra-deep borehole
electromagnetic (EM) measurements, which are critical for geosteering. Using a
deep neural network (DNN) as a forward model allows us to perform thousands of
model evaluations within seconds, which is very useful for quantifying
uncertainties and non-uniqueness in real-time. While significant efforts are
usually made to ensure the accuracy of the DNN models, it is known that they
contain unknown model errors in the regions not covered by the training data.
When DNNs are utilized during inversion of EM measurements, the effects of the
model errors could manifest themselves as a bias in the estimated input
parameters and, consequently, might result in a low-quality geosteering
decision. We present numerical results highlighting the challenges associated
with the inversion of EM measurements while neglecting model error. We further
demonstrate the utility of a recently proposed flexible iterative ensemble

socially-informed dialogue agent, Prost. Empirical results show that Prost
generates more socially acceptable dialogues compared to other state-of-the-art

Additionally, Canary effectively guides conversational agents and off-the-shelf

Thus, when the robot and the human communicate, there is already some formalism

its validity on various scales. In this paper, we use the Type Ia supernova
(SN~Ia) magnitude-redshift relation, from both the Pantheon and JLA
compilations, to constrain theoretically motivated anisotropies in the Hubble
flow. In particular, we constrain the quadrupole moment in the effective Hubble
parameter and the dipole moment in the effective deceleration parameter. We
find no significant quadrupole term regardless of the redshift frame we use.
Our results are consistent with the theoretical expectation of a quadrupole
moment of a few percent at scales of $\sim 100 h^{-1}$ Mpc. We place an upper
limit of a $\sim 10\%$ quadrupole amplitude relative to the monopole, $H_0$, at
these scales. We find that we can detect a $\sim 7\%$ quadrupole moment at the
5$\sigma$ level, for a forecast low-$z$ sample of 1055 SNe~Ia. We find an
exponentially decaying dipole moment of the deceleration parameter varies in
significance depending on the redshift frame we use. In the heliocentric frame,
as expected, it is detected at $\sim 3 \sigma$ significance. In the rest-frame
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we find a marginal $\sim 2 \sigma$
dipole, however, after applying peculiar velocity corrections, the dipole is
insignificant. Finally, we find the best-fit frame of rest relative to the
supernovae to differ from that of the CMB.

us to collect large amount of accurate logical forms from tables without human

poisoned training data, the adversary can embed a ""backdoor"" into the victim

containing a keyword) to be predicted as a target label of the adversary's
choice. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to design a backdoor
attack that is both stealthy (i.e., hard to notice) and effective (i.e., has a

set of ""trigger words"". These trigger words are iteratively identified and
injected into the target-label instances through natural word-level
perturbations. The poisoned training data instruct the victim model to predict
the target label on inputs containing trigger words, forming the backdoor.
Experiments on four text classification datasets show that our proposed attack
is significantly more effective than baseline methods while maintaining decent
stealthiness, raising alarm on the usage of untrusted training data. We further

fermions with a physical strange quark mass and a range of light quark masses,
we show that the endpoint of the line of first-order Roberge-Weiss (RW)
transitions between center sectors is second order for light quark masses
$m_l\ge m_s/320$, and that it belongs to the $3$-d, $Z(2)$ universality class.
The operator for the chiral condensate behaves like an energy-like operator in
an effective spin model for the RW phase transition. As a consequence, for any
non-zero value of the quark mass, the chiral condensate will have an infinite
slope at the RW phase transition temperature, $T_{RW}$. Its fluctuation, the
disconnected chiral susceptibility, behaves like the specific heat in $Z(2)$
symmetric models and diverges in the infinite volume limit at the RW phase

participants jointly train a powerful model without sharing their private data.
One desirable property for FL is the implementation of the right to be
forgotten (RTBF), i.e., a leaving participant has the right to request to
delete its private data from the global model. However, unlearning itself may
not be enough to implement RTBF unless the unlearning effect can be
independently verified, an important aspect that has been overlooked in the
current literature. In this paper, we prompt the concept of verifiable
federated unlearning, and propose VeriFi, a unified framework integrating
federated unlearning and verification that allows systematic analysis of the
unlearning and quantification of its effect, with different combinations of
multiple unlearning and verification methods. In VeriFi, the leaving
participant is granted the right to verify (RTV), that is, the participant
notifies the server before leaving, then actively verifies the unlearning
effect in the next few communication rounds. The unlearning is done at the
server side immediately after receiving the leaving notification, while the
verification is done locally by the leaving participant via two steps: marking
(injecting carefully-designed markers to fingerprint the leaver) and checking
(examining the change of the global model's performance on the markers). Based
on VeriFi, we conduct the first systematic and large-scale study for verifiable
federated unlearning, considering 7 unlearning methods and 5 verification
methods. Particularly, we propose a more efficient and FL-friendly unlearning
method, and two more effective and robust non-invasive-verification methods. We
extensively evaluate VeriFi on 7 datasets and 4 types of deep learning models.
Our analysis establishes important empirical understandings for more
trustworthy federated unlearning.

widely being used to improve disease management strategies of infectious
diseases. Many diseases present some form of intra-host quiescent stage, also
known as covert infection, while others exhibit dormant stages in the
environment. As quiescent/dormant stages can be resistant to drug, antibiotics,
fungicide treatments, it is of practical relevance to study the influence of
these two life-history traits on the coevolutionary dynamics. We develop first
a deterministic coevolutionary model with two parasite types infecting one host
type and study analytically the stability of the dynamical system. We
specifically derive a stability condition for a five-by-five system of
equations with quiescence. Second, we develop a stochastic version of the model
to study the influence of quiescence on stochasticity of the system dynamics.
We compute the steady state distribution of the parasite types which follows a
multivariate normal distribution. Furthermore, we obtain numerical solutions
for the covariance matrix of the system under symmetric and asymmetric
quiescence rates between parasite types. When parasite strains are identical,
quiescence increases the variance of the number of infected individuals at high
transmission rate and vice versa when the transmission rate is low. However,
when there is competition between parasite strains with different quiescent
rates, quiescence generates a moving average behaviour which dampen off
stochasticity and decreases the variance of the number of infected hosts. The
strain with the highest rate of entering quiescence determines the strength of
the moving average and the magnitude of reduction of stochasticity. Thus, it is
worth investigating simple models of multi-strain parasite under
quiescence/dormancy to improve disease management strategies.

confined nuclear fusion. It greatly reduces the particle and heat flux incident

is therefore advantageous to have accurate simulations of plasma behaviour in
the divertor to design future Tokamak divertors. A common simulation package
used for this purpose is SOLPS-ITER, which has previously been observed to be
underestimating the contribution of molecular effects to plasma detachment. To
correct this, its reaction rate for molecular charge exchange was altered. This
alteration resulted in a significant increase in the density of $D_2^+$ ions
within the divertor. The particle balance and $D\alpha$ emission data was then
computed from the simulation outputs. These were compared to experimental data
and a set of post-processing routines for the original simulations that
predicts the effect of a corrected charge exchange rate. In comparison to the
post-processing predictions: the increase in Molecular activated Recombination
and the depth of the target flux rollover was less than predicted. This is due
to the post-processing not being self consistent and it does not account for
how the alterations in reaction rate would affect the background plasma.
Compared to the experimental data: the correction showed a significant
improvement in the agreement of general trends, such as the increased MAR
reaction rate and the rollover of target flux. However, there were still
significant disagreements in the magnitudes of various reaction rates,
suggesting further improvements to SOLPS-ITER are still needed.

the dynamic behaviour in many astrophysical objects during transient events
like gamma-ray bursts, solar flares, magnetar flares and fast radio bursts.
Astrophysicists often search for QPOs with frequency-domain methods such as
(Lomb-Scargle) periodograms, which generally assume power-law models plus some
excess around the QPO frequency. Time-series data can alternatively be
investigated directly in the time domain using Gaussian Process (GP)
regression. While GP regression is computationally expensive in the general
case, the properties of astrophysical data and models allow fast likelihood
strategies. Heteroscedasticity and non-stationarity in data have been shown to
cause bias in periodogram-based analyses. Gaussian processes can take account
of these properties. Using GPs, we model QPOs as a stochastic process on top of
a deterministic flare shape. Using Bayesian inference, we demonstrate how to
infer GP hyperparameters and assign them physical meaning, such as the QPO
frequency. We also perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models
such as red noise and show that this can be used to reliably find QPOs. This
method is easily applicable to a variety of different astrophysical data sets.
We demonstrate the use of this method on a range of short transients: a
gamma-ray burst, a magnetar flare, a magnetar giant flare, and simulated solar
flare data.

advantage for societies. It is the process of creating more complex
technologies, ideas, or protocols from existing ones. While innovation may be
created by single agents (i.e. individuals or organisations), it is often a
result of social interactions between agents exchanging and combining
complementary expertise and perspectives. The structure of social networks
impacts this knowledge exchange process. To study the role of social network
structures on the creation of new technologies, we design an evolutionary
mechanistic model combining self-creation and social learning. We find that
social heterogeneity allows agents to leverage the benefits of diversity and to
develop technologies of higher complexity. Social heterogeneity, however,
reduces the group ability to innovate. Not only the social structure but also
the openness of agents to collaborate affect innovation. We find that
interdisciplinary interactions lead to more complex technologies benefiting the
entire group but also increase the inequality in the innovation output. Lower
openness to interdisciplinary collaborations may be compensated by a higher
ability to collaborate with multiple peers, but low openness also neutralises
the intrinsic benefits of network heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that
social network heterogeneity has contrasting effects on microscopic (local) and
macroscopic (group) levels, suggesting that the emergence of innovation leaders
may suppress the overall group performance.

contrast to traditional wireless communication methods that focus on the

achieve better transmission efficiency by only sending the semantic-related
information of the source data. In this paper, we consider semantic-oriented
speech transmission which transmits only the semantic-relevant information over
the channel for the speech recognition task, and a compact additional set of
semantic-irrelevant information for the speech reconstruction task. We propose
a novel end-to-end DL-based transceiver which extracts and encodes the semantic
information from the input speech spectrums at the transmitter and outputs the
corresponding transcriptions from the decoded semantic information at the
receiver. For the speech to speech transmission, we further include a CTC
alignment module that extracts a small number of additional semantic-irrelevant
but speech-related information for the better reconstruction of the original
speech signals at the receiver. The simulation results confirm that our
proposed method outperforms current methods in terms of the accuracy of the
predicted text for the speech to text transmission and the quality of the
recovered speech signals for the speech to speech transmission, and
significantly improves transmission efficiency. More specifically, the proposed
method only sends 16% of the amount of the transmitted symbols required by the
existing methods while achieving about 10% reduction in WER for the speech to
text transmission. For the speech to speech transmission, it results in an even
more remarkable improvement in terms of transmission efficiency with only 0.2%

and technological advances. A central focus in modern research is to extend the
generation and control of entangled states from few to many qubits, and protect
them against decoherence. Optical photons play a prominent role as these qubit
carriers are naturally robust and easy to manipulate. However, the most
successful technique to date for creating photonic entanglement is inherently
probabilistic and therefore subject to severe scalability limitations. Here we
avoid these by implementing a deterministic protocol with a single memory atom
in a cavity. We interleave controlled single-photon emissions with tailored
atomic qubit rotations to efficiently grow Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
of up to 14 photons and linear cluster states of up to 12 photons with a
fidelity lower bounded by 76(6)% and 56(4)%, respectively. Thanks to a
source-to-detection efficiency of 43.18(7)% per photon we measure these large
states about once every minute, orders of magnitude faster than in any previous
experiment. In the future, this rate could be increased even further, the
scheme could be extended to two atoms in a cavity, or several sources could be
quantum mechanically coupled, to generate higher-dimensional cluster states.
Our work therefore removes a long-standing obstacle towards scalable

metric, it presents itself as a promising candidate for code-based
cryptography. We give a polynomial-time reduction from the classical
Hamming-metric decoding problem, which proves the NP-hardness of the decoding
problem in the cover metric. We then provide a generic decoder, following the
information set decoding idea from Prange's algorithm in the Hamming metric. A
study of its cost then shows that the complexity is exponential in the number
of rows and columns, which is in contrast to the behaviour in the Hamming
metric, where the complexity grows exponentially in the number of code symbols.

usually bound within hundreds of micrometers by the commonly-used
scanning-based fabrication methods, limiting their usage on practical optical
devices like telescopes. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a
high-efficiency, single-lens, refractive metalens telescope. We developed a
mass production-friendly workflow for fabricating wafer-scale (80-mm aperture)
metalenses using deep-ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography and a multi-exposure
process involving reticle rotation and pattern stitching to leverage the radial
symmetry of metalenses. Our metalens works in the near-infrared region (1200 -
1600 nm) with diffraction-limited performance and a high peak focusing
efficiency of 80.84% at 1450 nm experimentally. Based on the metalens, we built
a single-lens telescope and acquired images of the lunar surface, revealing its
geographical structures. We believe our demonstration of the metalens telescope
proves the exciting potential lying in the metasurfaces and could bring new
possibilities for areas involving large optical systems, including geosciences,
planetary observation, and astrophysical science.

computer vision tasks, highly depends on the definition of the loss function -
a measure of how accurately your ML model can predict the expected outcome.
Conventional object detection loss functions depend on aggregation of metrics
of bounding box regression such as the distance, overlap area and aspect ratio
of the predicted and ground truth boxes (i.e. GIoU, CIoU, ICIoU etc). However,
none of the methods proposed and used to date considers the direction of the
mismatch between the desired ground box and the predicted, ""experimental"" box.
This shortage results in slower and less effective convergence as the predicted
box can ""wander around"" during the training process and eventually end up
producing a worse model. In this paper a new loss function SIoU was suggested,
where penalty metrics were redefined considering the angle of the vector
between the desired regression. Applied to conventional Neural Networks and
datasets it is shown that SIoU improves both the speed of training and the
accuracy of the inference. The effectiveness of the proposed loss function was
revealed in a number of simulations and tests.

into photonic circuits is one of the major goals in achieving integrated
quantum circuits~(IQCs). This is demonstrated successfully in recent decades.
Controlling the nonclassicality generation in these micron-scale devices is
also crucial for the robust operation of the IQCs. Here, we propose a
micron-scale quantum entanglement device whose nonlinearity (so the generated
nonclassicality) can be tuned by several orders of magnitude via an
\textit{applied voltage} without altering the linear response. Quantum
emitters~(QEs), whose level-spacing can be tuned by voltage, are embedded into
the hotspot of a metal nanostructure~(MNS). QE-MNS coupling introduces a Fano
resonance in the ``nonlinear response''. Nonlinearity, already enhanced
extremely due to localization, can be controlled by the QEs' level-spacing.
Nonlinearity can either be suppressed (also when the probe is on the device) or
be further enhanced by several orders. Fano resonance takes place in a
relatively narrow frequency window so that $\sim$meV voltage-tunability for QEs
becomes sufficient for a \textit{continuous} turning on/off of the
nonclassicality. This provides as much as 5 orders of magnitude modulation
depths.

states which are part molecule, part surface-bound light. Since molecular
resonances may acquire the spatial coherence of plasmons, which have mm-scale
propagation lengths, strong-coupling with molecular resonances potentially
enables long-range molecular energy transfer. Gratings are often used to couple
incident light to surface plasmons, by scattering the otherwise non-radiative
surface plasmon inside the light-line. We calculate the dispersion relation for
surface plasmons strongly coupled to molecular resonances when grating
scattering is involved. By treating the molecules as independent oscillators
rather than the more typically-considered single collective dipole, we find the
full multi-band dispersion relation. This approach offers a natural way to
include the dark states in the dispersion. We demonstrate that for a molecular
resonance tuned near the crossing point of forward and backward
grating-scattered plasmon modes, the interaction between plasmons and molecules
gives a five-band dispersion relation, including a bright state not captured in
calculations using a single collective dipole. We also show that the role of
the grating in breaking the translational invariance of the system appears in
the position-dependent coupling between the molecules and the surface plasmon.
The presence of the grating is thus not only important for the experimental
observation of molecule-surface-plasmon coupling, but also provides an
additional design parameter that tunes the system.

optical (1.4 and 2.2 days post-burst) and X-ray (8.4 and 13.6 days post-burst)

the standard model for a GRB seen on-axis, which expands and decelerates into a
medium with a homogeneous density, while a circumburst medium with a wind-like
profile is disfavoured. Notwithstanding the high resolution provided by the
VLBI, we could not pinpoint any expansion or centroid displacement of the
outflow. If the GRB is seen at the viewing angle which maximises the apparent
velocity, we estimate that the Lorentz factor for the possible proper motion is
$\Gamma_{\alpha}$ < 40 in right ascension and $\Gamma_{\delta}$ < 61 in

afterglow is <5 pc and <16 pc at 25 and 47 days. Finally, the early peak in the

0.01 days from the burst.

not been systematically investigated by existing work. By evaluating seven
pre-trained models, including ResNets and ViT's with self-supervision and

DomainBed benchmarks, with five different learning algorithms, we provide the
first comprehensive empirical study focusing on pre-training and data

the following main observations: 1) ERM combined with data augmentation can
achieve state-of-the-art performance if we choose a proper pre-trained model
respecting the data property; 2) specialized algorithms further improve the
robustness on top of ERM when handling a specific type of distribution shift,
e.g., GroupDRO for spurious correlation and CORAL for large-scale
out-of-distribution data; 3) Comparing different pre-training modes,
architectures and data sizes, we provide novel observations about pre-training
on distribution shift, which sheds light on designing or selecting pre-training
strategy for different kinds of distribution shifts. In summary, our empirical
study provides a comprehensive baseline for a wide range of pre-training models
fine-tuned with data augmentation, which potentially inspires research
exploiting the power of pre-training and data augmentation in the future of
distribution shift study.

staff not trained in the security domain. We employ hardware security tokens
that allow to reduce every day configuration to one physical interaction. Our
results show the practical feasibility of our proposed scheme and that it does
not reduce the security level of industrial security gateways in any way.

Temporal Difference (TD), an incomplete gradient descent method prevails. In

complexity. In this work, we propose a novel implementation of HAR based on
deep neural networks, and precisely on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), targeting
low-power general purpose processors with a RISC-V instruction set. BNNs yield
very small memory footprints and low inference complexity, thanks to the
replacement of arithmetic operations with bit-wise ones. However, existing BNN
implementations on general purpose processors impose constraints tailored to
complex computer vision tasks, which result in over-parametrized models for
simpler problems like HAR. Therefore, we also introduce a new BNN inference
library, which targets ultra-compact models explicitly. With experiments on a
single-core RISC-V processor, we show that BNNs trained on two HAR datasets
obtain higher classification accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art baseline
based on RFs. Furthermore, our BNN reaches the same accuracy of a RF with
either less memory (up to 91%) or more energy-efficiency (up to 70%), depending
on the complexity of the features extracted by the RF.

the corresponding Halpha images led us to select 118 reliable Halpha emitting
gas clouds. The signals are faint, with a surface brightness of 10**(-17.3 pm
0.3) erg/s/cm2/arcsec2. Through statistical tests and other arguments, we ruled
out that they are created by instrumental artifacts, telluric line residuals,
or high redshift interlopers. Around 38% of the time, the Halpha line profile
shows a double peak with the drop in intensity at the rest-frame of the central
galaxy, and with a typical peak-to-peak separation of the order of pm 200 km/s.
Most line emission clumps are spatially unresolved. The mass of emitting gas is
estimated to be between one and 10**(-3) times the stellar mass of the central
galaxy. The signals are not isotropically distributed; their azimuth tends to
be aligned with the major axis of the corresponding galaxy. The distances to
the central galaxies are not random either. The counts drop at a distance > 50
galaxy radii, which roughly corresponds to the virial radius of the central
galaxy. We explore several physical scenarios to explain this Halpha emission,
among which accretion disks around rogue intermediate mass black holes fit the
observations best.

However, the CB-SMBHs orbit may become highly eccentric throughout the
evolution of these objects, and the orbital period may be far longer than the
observational time baseline. We investigate the problem of detecting the
CB-SMBH with hot dust emission and high eccentricity (eCBSMBH, e=0.5) when the
observed time baselines of their astrometric data and radial velocities are
considerably shorter than the orbital period. The parameter space of the
Keplerian model of the eCBSMBH is large for exploratory purposes. We therefore
applied the Bayesian method to fit orbital elements of the eCBSMBH to combined
radial velocity and astrometric data covering a small fraction of the orbital
period. We estimate that a number of potential eCBSMBH systems within reach of
GRAVITY + will be similar to the number of the planned circular targets. We
show that using observational time baselines that cover ~ 10% of the orbit
increases the possibility of determining the period, eccentricity, and total
mass of an eCBSMBH. When the observational time baseline becomes too short (~
5%), the quality of the retrieved eCBSMBH parameters degrades. We also
illustrate how interferometry may be used to estimate the photo-centre at the
eCBSMBH emission line, which could be relevant for GRAVITY+ successors. Even if
the astrometric signal for eCBSMBH systems is reduced by a factor of
sqrt{1-e^{2}} compared to circular ones, we find that the hot dust emission of
eCBSMBHs can be traced by GRAVITY+ at the elementary level.

the propagative and composable nature of trust graphs into a GNN framework for
better trust evaluation. Specifically, TrustGNN designs specific propagative
patterns for different propagative processes of trust, and distinguishes the

TrustGNN can learn comprehensive node embeddings and predict trust

Existing approaches are mainly based on anchor-based boxes or dense points,

reasoning. Recently, the emerging transformer-based approaches view object
detection as a direct set prediction problem that effectively removes the need

prior knowledge of each game. This dramatically advanced progress on a
long-standing AI challenge to create programs that can learn for themselves
from first principles.
  Theoretically, there are well-known limits to the power of deep learning for

and is unsuitable for general AI. However, none of these works has suggested
any specific limits for any particular game.
  In this paper, we provide more powerful bottlenecks than previously
suggested. We present the first concrete example of a game - namely the
(children) game of nim - and other impartial games that seem to be a stumbling
block for AlphaZero and similar reinforcement learning algorithms. We show
experimentally that the bottlenecks apply to both the policy and value

i.e. has very low-complexity, our experimental results supersede known
theoretical limits based on many games' PSPACE (and NEXPTIME) completeness.
  We show that nim can be learned on small boards, but when the board size
increases, AlphaZero style algorithms rapidly fail to improve.
  We quantify the difficulties for various setups, parameter settings and

gravity (MONG). The observed flat rotation curves of galaxies were also
accounted for through these postulates. Here we extend these postulates to
galaxy clusters and model the dynamical velocity-distance curve for a typical
cluster such as the Virgo cluster. The radial velocities of galaxies in the
Virgo cluster are also obtained through this model. Observations show an
inconsistency in the Hubble flow at a mean cluster distance of 17 Mpc, which is

the largely uncharted waters of nonequilibrium systems, the fluctuation
theorems being the more familiar. In this work we aim to trace the
uncertainties of thermodynamic quantities in nonequilibrium systems to their
quantum origins, namely, to the quantum uncertainty principles. Our results
enable us to make this categorical statement: For Gaussian systems,
thermodynamic functions are functionals of the Robertson-Schrodinger
uncertainty function, which is always non-negative for quantum systems, but not
necessarily so for classical systems. Here, quantum refers to noncommutativity
of the canonical operator pairs. From the nonequilibrium free energy[1], we
succeeded in deriving several inequalities between certain thermodynamic
quantities. They assume the same forms as those in conventional thermodynamics,
but these are nonequilibrium in nature and they hold for all times and at
strong coupling. In addition we show that a fluctuation-dissipation inequality
exists at all times in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system. For
nonequilibrium systems which relax to an equilibrium state at late times, this
fluctuation-dissipation inequality leads to the Robertson-Schrodinger
uncertainty principle with the help of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This work
provides the microscopic quantum basis to certain important thermodynamic
properties of macroscopic nonequilibrium systems.

situations where classical methods for estimating the total treatment effect on
a target population are considerably biased due to confounding network effects,
i.e., the fact that the treatment of an individual may impact their neighbors'
outcomes, an issue referred to as network interference or as non-individualized
treatment response. A key challenge in these situations, is that the network is
often unknown, and difficult, or costly, to measure. In this paper, we
characterize the limitations in estimating the total treatment effect without
knowledge of the network that drives interference, assuming a potential
outcomes model with heterogeneous additive network effects. This model
encompasses a broad class of network interference sources, including spillover,
peer effects, and contagion. Within this framework, we show that, surprisingly,
given access to average historical baseline measurements prior to the
experiment, we can develop a simple estimator and efficient randomized design
that outputs an unbiased estimate with low variance. Our solution does not
require knowledge of the underlying network structure, and it comes with
statistical guarantees for a broad class of models. We believe our results are

nearly airless bodies. However, such transport requires that the body can both
form and retain an exosphere. To form a sublimation exosphere requires the
surface of a body to be sufficiently warm for surface volatiles to sublime; to
retain an exosphere, the ballistic escape and photodestruction rates and other
loss mechanisms must be sufficiently low. Here we construct a simple free
molecular model of exospheres formed by volatile desorption/sublimation. We
consider the conditions for forming and retaining exospheres for common
volatile species across the Solar System, and explore how three processes
(desorption/sublimation, ballistic loss, and photodestruction) shape exospheric
dynamics on airless bodies. Our model finds that the CO2 exosphere of Callisto
is too dense to be sustained by impact-delivered volatiles, but could be
maintained by only ~7 hectares of exposed CO2 ice. We predict the peak surface
locations of Callisto's CO2 exosphere along with other Galilean moons, which
could be tested by JUICE observations. Our model finds that to maintain
Iapetus' two-tone appearance, its dark Cassini Regio likely has unresolved
exposures of water ice, perhaps in sub-resolution impact craters, that amount
to up to ~0.06% of its surface. In the Uranian system, we find that the CO2
deposits on Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon are unlikely to have been
delivered via impacts, but are consistent with both a magnetospheric origin or
sourced endogenously. We suggest that exosphere-mediated volatile transport
could produce these moons' leading/trailing CO2 asymmetries, and may be a
seasonal equinox feature that could be largely erased by volatile migration
during the Uranian solstices. We calculate that ~2.4-6.4 mm thick layer of CO2
could migrate about the surface of Uranus' large moons during a seasonal cycle.

the distance function to the graph of the set-valued mapping under

understanding the generalization performance of overparameterized models has
become an increasingly popular question. To this end, there has been
substantial effort to characterize the implicit bias of the optimization
algorithms used, such as gradient descent (GD), and the structural properties
of their preferred solutions. This paper answers an open question in this
literature: For the classification setting, what solution does mirror descent
(MD) converge to? Specifically, motivated by its efficient implementation, we
consider the family of mirror descent algorithms with potential function chosen
as the $p$-th power of the $\ell_p$-norm, which is an important generalization
of GD. We call this algorithm $p$-$\textsf{GD}$. For this family, we
characterize the solutions it obtains and show that it converges in direction
to a generalized maximum-margin solution with respect to the $\ell_p$-norm for
linearly separable classification. While the MD update rule is in general
expensive to compute and perhaps not suitable for deep learning,
$p$-$\textsf{GD}$ is fully parallelizable in the same manner as SGD and can be
used to train deep neural networks with virtually no additional computational
overhead. Using comprehensive experiments with both linear and deep neural
network models, we demonstrate that $p$-$\textsf{GD}$ can noticeably affect the
structure and the generalization performance of the learned models.

Language Processing. It requires ""bidirectional"" language processing: firstly,
the system has to understand the input text (Natural Language Understanding)

Language Generation). In this article, we introduce our framework for
generating the factual questions from unstructured text in the English
language. It uses a combination of traditional linguistic approaches based on
sentence patterns with several machine learning methods. We firstly obtain
lexical, syntactic and semantic information from an input text and we then
construct a hierarchical set of patterns for each sentence. The set of features
is extracted from the patterns and it is then used for automated learning of
new transformation rules. Our learning process is totally data-driven because
the transformation rules are obtained from a set of initial sentence-question
pairs. The advantages of this approach lie in a simple expansion of new
transformation rules which allows us to generate various types of questions and
also in the continuous improvement of the system by reinforcement learning. The
framework also includes a question evaluation module which estimates the
quality of generated questions. It serves as a filter for selecting the best
questions and eliminating incorrect ones or duplicates. We have performed
several experiments to evaluate the correctness of generated questions and we
have also compared our system with several state-of-the-art systems. Our
results indicate that the quality of generated questions outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems and our questions are also comparable to questions
created by humans. We have also created and published an interface with all

coefficients cannot simultaneously oscillate with equal amplitude and
equal/opposite phase. Our analytical demonstration is fulfilled regardless of
the refractive index, sphere size, and multipolar order. In addition, we show
that the helicity of light fields inside lossy spheres can be conserved. This

second level is an authentication mechanism based on dynamic port knocking. The
two security levels were tested in a virtual environment with P4 based

both the levels to allow or drop the packets. For port knocking a new random
sequence is generated for every new host. Hosts can only connect using the
correct sequence assigned to them.The tests conducted show this approach
performs better than the previous P4 based firewall approaches due to two
security levels. Moreover, it is successful in mitigating specific security

experience due to their various advantages over textual interfaces. Spoken
language understanding (SLU) systems are fundamental building blocks of spoken
dialog systems. But creating SLU systems for low resourced languages is still a
challenge. In a large number of low resourced language, we don't have access to
enough data to build automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies, which are
fundamental to any SLU system. Also, ASR based SLU systems do not generalize to
unwritten languages. In this paper, we present a series of experiments to
explore extremely low-resourced settings where we perform intent classification
with systems trained on as low as one data-point per intent and with only one
speaker in the dataset. We also work in a low-resourced setting where we do not
use language specific ASR systems to transcribe input speech, which compounds
the challenge of building SLU systems to simulate a true low-resourced setting.
We test our system on Belgian Dutch (Flemish) and English and find that using
phonetic transcriptions to make intent classification systems in such
low-resourced setting performs significantly better than using speech features.
Specifically, when using a phonetic transcription based system over a feature
based system, we see average improvements of 12.37% and 13.08% for binary and
four-class classification problems respectively, when averaged over 49
different experimental settings.

dominated by a strong broad continuum all the way down to below $J_1$
coexisting with the lowest-energy triplon modes characterizing the plaquette

fractionalized spinon excitations. In the stripe phase, a clear difference from
the linear spin wave approximation is that the spectrum is gapped at the $M$

fluctuations. We point out that the features observed in the N\'{e}el phase are

characterized by a $d$-dimensional volume vector; the objective is to partition
the items into a minimum number of subsets (bins), such that the total volume

  Our main result is an asymptotic approximation algorithm for $d$VBP that
yields a ratio of $(1+\ln d-\chi(d) +\varepsilon)$ for all $d \in \mathbb{N}$
and any $\varepsilon > 0$; here, $\chi(d)$ is some strictly positive function.
This improves upon the best known asymptotic ratio of $ \left(1+ \ln d
+\varepsilon\right)$ due to Bansal, Caprara and Sviridenko (SICOMP 2010) for
any $d >3$. By slightly modifying our algorithm to include an initial matching

  Our algorithm iteratively solves a configuration LP relaxation for the
residual instance (from previous iterations) and samples a small number of

reconstruction of stray magnetic fields from an Abrikosov vortex, trapped in

technology has advanced rapidly to assist physicians in the diagnosis of
pathological pictures of gastric cancer. Ensemble learning is a way to improve
the accuracy of algorithms, and finding multiple learning models with
complementarity types is the basis of ensemble learning. The complementarity of
sub-size pathology image classifiers when machine performance is insufficient
is explored in this experimental platform. We choose seven classical machine
learning classifiers and four deep learning classifiers for classification
experiments on the GasHisSDB database. Among them, classical machine learning
algorithms extract five different image virtual features to match multiple
classifier algorithms. For deep learning, we choose three convolutional neural
network classifiers. In addition, we also choose a novel Transformer-based
classifier. The experimental platform, in which a large number of classical
machine learning and deep learning methods are performed, demonstrates that
there are differences in the performance of different classifiers on GasHisSDB.
Classical machine learning models exist for classifiers that classify Abnormal
categories very well, while classifiers that excel in classifying Normal
categories also exist. Deep learning models also exist with multiple models
that can be complementarity. Suitable classifiers are selected for ensemble
learning, when machine performance is insufficient. This experimental platform
demonstrates that multiple classifiers are indeed complementarity and can
improve the efficiency of ensemble learning. This can better assist doctors in
diagnosis, improve the detection of gastric cancer, and increase the cure rate.

beams opens a new program of precision physics at a center-of-mass energy of
10.58 GeV. This white paper describes the physics potential of this `Chiral
Belle' program. It includes projections for precision measurements of
$\sin^2\theta_W$ that can be obtained from independent left-right asymmetry
measurements of $e^+e^-$ transitions to pairs of electrons, muons, taus, charm
and b-quarks. The $\sin^2\theta_W$ precision obtainable at SuperKEKB will match
that of the LEP/SLC world average, but at the centre-of-mass energy of 10.58
GeV. Measurements of the couplings for muons, charm, and $b$-quarks will be
substantially improved and the existing $3\sigma$ discrepancy between the SLC
$A_{LR}$ and LEP $A_{FB}^b$ measurements will be addressed. Precision
measurements of neutral current universality will be more than an order of
magnitude more precise than currently available. As the energy scale is well
away from the $Z^0$-pole, the precision measurements will have sensitivity to
the presence of a parity-violating dark sector gauge boson, $Z_{\rm dark}$. The
program also enables the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment $g-2$
form factor of the $\tau$ to be made at an unprecedented level of precision. A
precision of $10^{-5}$ level is accessible with 40~ab$^{-1}$ and with more data
it would start to approach the $10^{-6}$ level. This technique would provide
the most precise information from the third generation about potential new
physics explanations of the muon $g-2$ $4\sigma$ anomaly. Additional $\tau$ and
QCD physics programs enabled or enhanced with having polarized electron beams
are also discussed in this White Paper. This paper includes a summary of the
path forward in R&D and next steps required to implement this upgrade and
access its exciting discovery potential.

exact solution showing that our method also helps correcting the long-standing
issue of positivity violation, albeit without complete positivity. Our method
of a canonically consistent quantum master equation, opens a new perspective in
the theory of open quantum systems leading to a reduced density matrix accurate
beyond the commonly used Redfield and Lindblad equations, while retaining the

non-Hermitian optimization thanks to the so-called transcorrelated (TC)
framework, the two methods yielding the same results in the limit of a complete
basis set. By rewriting the TC equations as an effective self-consistent
Hermitian problem, our approach requires the sampling of a single quantity per
Slater determinant, leading to minimal memory requirements in the QMC code.
Using analytical quantities obtained from both the TC framework and the usual
CI-type calculations, we also propose improved estimators which reduce the
statistical fluctuations of the sampled quantities by more than an order of
magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method on wave functions

In this
review article we discuss our various proposals to observationally constrain

distant quasar or GRB can be noticeably distorted by spacetime-foam-induced
phase incoherence. As the phase fluctuations are proportional to the distance
to the source, but inversely proportional to the wavelength, ultra-high energy
photons ($>1$ TeV) from distant sources are particularly useful. We elaborate
on several proposals, including the possibility of detecting spacetime foam by
observing ""seeing disks"" in the images of distant quasars and active galactic
nuclei. We also discuss the appropriate distance measure for calculating the
expected angular broadening. In addition, we discuss our more recent work in
which we investigate whether wave-front distortions on small scales (due to
spacetime foam) can cause distant objects become undetectable because the phase
fluctuations have accumulated to the point at which image formation is
impossible. Another possibility that has recently become accessible is to use
interferometers to observe cosmologically distant sources, therefore giving a
large baseline perpendicular to the local wave vector over which the wave front
could become corrugated and thus distorted, reducing or eliminating its fringe
visibility. We argue that all these methods ultimately depend on the
availability of ways (if any) to carry out proper averaging of contributions
from different light paths from the source to the telescope.

Adversarial (SUA) network which accounts for both intensity and structural
differences between the training and test sets when performing image
segmentation. It consists of a spatial transformation block followed by an
intensity distribution rendering module. The spatial transformation block is
proposed to reduce the structure gap between the two images, and also produce
an inverse deformation field to warp the final segmented image back. The
intensity distribution rendering module then renders the deformed structure to
an image with the target intensity distribution. Experimental results show that
the proposed SUA method has the capability to transfer both intensity
distribution and structural content between multiple datasets.

the Second Gaia Data Release (Gaia DR2) source 3449076721168026624 (m$_v$ =
14.1 mag) by the plutino object 2003 VS$_2$ (hereafter, VS$_2$) on 2019 October
22. We also carried out photometric observations to derive the rotational light
curve amplitude and rotational phase of VS$_2$ during the stellar occultation.
Combining the results and assuming a triaxial shape, we derived the 3D shape of
VS$_2$.
  Out of the 39 observatories involved in the observational campaign, 12 sites
reported a positive detection; this makes it one of the best observed stellar
occultations by a TNO so far. We obtained a rotational light curve amplitude of
${\Delta}$m = 0.264 $\pm$ 0.017 mag, a mean area-equivalent diameter of
D$_{A_{eq}}$ = 545 $\pm$ 13 km, and a geometric albedo of 0.134 $\pm$ 0.010.
The best triaxial shape obtained for VS$_2$ has semiaxes a = 339 $\pm$ 5 km, b
= 235 $\pm$ 6 km, and c = 226 $\pm$ 8 km. The derived aspect angle is
${\theta}$ = 59${\deg} \pm$ 2${\deg}$ or its supplementary ${\theta}$ =
121${\deg} \pm$ 2${\deg}$, depending on the north-pole position. The
spherical-volume equivalent diameter is D$_{V_{eq}}$ = 524 $\pm$ 7 km. If we
consider large albedo patches on its surface, the semi-major axis of the
ellipsoid could be ~10 km smaller. These results are compatible with the
previous ones determined from the single-chord 2013 and four-chord 2014 stellar
occultations and with the effective diameter and albedo derived from Herschel
and Spitzer data. They provide evidence that VS$_2$'s 3D shape is not
compatible with a homogeneous triaxial body in hydrostatic equilibrium, but it
might be a differentiated body and/or might be sustaining some stress. No
secondary features related to rings or material orbiting around VS$_2$ were
detected.

  Function","21 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) aggregates the source votes of multiple
weak supervision sources into probabilistic training labels, which are in turn
used to train an end model. With its increasing popularity, it is critical to
have some tool for users to understand the influence of each component (e.g.,
the source vote or training data) in the pipeline and interpret the end model
behavior. To achieve this, we build on Influence Function (IF) and propose
source-aware IF, which leverages the generation process of the probabilistic
labels to decompose the end model's training objective and then calculate the
influence associated with each (data, source, class) tuple. These primitive
influence score can then be used to estimate the influence of individual
component of PWS, such as source vote, supervision source, and training data.
On datasets of diverse domains, we demonstrate multiple use cases: (1)
interpreting incorrect predictions from multiple angles that reveals insights
for debugging the PWS pipeline, (2) identifying mislabeling of sources with a
gain of 9%-37% over baselines, and (3) improving the end model's generalization
performance by removing harmful components in the training objective (13%-24%
better than ordinary IF).

potential presence of unreliable agents in the environment whose deviations
from expected behavior can prevent a system from accomplishing its intended
tasks. In particular, consensus is a fundamental underpinning problem of
cooperative distributed multi-agent systems. Consensus requires different
agents, situated in a decentralized communication network, to reach an
agreement out of a set of initial proposals that they put forward.
Learning-based agents should adopt a protocol that allows them to reach
consensus despite having one or more unreliable agents in the system. This
paper investigates the problem of unreliable agents in MARL, considering
consensus as case study. Echoing established results in the distributed systems
literature, our experiments show that even a moderate fraction of such agents
can greatly impact the ability of reaching consensus in a networked
environment. We propose Reinforcement Learning-based Trusted Consensus (RLTC),
a decentralized trust mechanism, in which agents can independently decide which
neighbors to communicate with. We empirically demonstrate that our trust
mechanism is able to deal with unreliable agents effectively, as evidenced by
higher consensus success rates.

based on one criterion: the model's accuracy. In this context, algorithms with
a higher accuracy (or similar measures) are considered as better. To achieve
new state-of-the-art results, algorithmic development is accompanied by an
exponentially increasing amount of compute. While this has enabled AI research
to achieve remarkable results, AI progress comes at a cost: it is
unsustainable. In this paper, we present a promising tool for sustainable and
thus Green AI: tensor networks (TNs). Being an established tool from
multilinear algebra, TNs have the capability to improve efficiency without
compromising accuracy. Since they can reduce compute significantly, we would
like to highlight their potential for Green AI. We elaborate in both a kernel
machine and deep learning setting how efficiency gains can be achieved with
TNs. Furthermore, we argue that better algorithms should be evaluated in terms
of both accuracy and efficiency. To that end, we discuss different efficiency
criteria and analyze efficiency in an exemplifying experimental setting for
kernel ridge regression. With this paper, we want to raise awareness about
Green AI and showcase its positive impact on sustainability and AI research.
Our key contribution is to demonstrate that TNs enable efficient algorithms and
therefore contribute towards Green AI. In this sense, TNs pave the way for
better algorithms in AI.

Coulomb-repulsion-based pairing mechanisms has proven to be a challenging task,
however the situation has changed after recent discovery of superconductivity
in non-twisted graphene bilayers and trilayers. Superconductivity occurring at
the phase boundaries of spin and valley polarized orders calls for non-phonon
scenarios, yet the specific pairing mechanisms remain to be understood. Here we
analyze a striking example -- superconductivity in graphene bilayers occurring
at the onset of valley-polarized order induced by a magnetic field. We describe
an attraction-from-repulsion mechanism for pairing mediated by a
quantum-critical mode, which fully explains the observed phenomenology. While
it is usually notoriously difficult to infer the pairing mechanism from the
observed superconducting phases, this case presents a rare exception, allowing
for a fairly unambiguous identification of the origin of the pairing glue. A
combination of factors such as the location of superconducting phase at the
onset of isospin-polarized phase, a threshold in a magnetic field, above which
superconductivity occurs, and its resilience at high magnetic fields paints a
clear picture of a triplet superconductivity driven by quantum-critical
fluctuations.

target detection and recognition tasks but are also capable of detecting and
identifying the RF stealth platform and weapons systems. The development of
radar technology is of the utmost importance in many avenues of research. The
concept of a quantum radar has been proposed which utilizes quantum states of
photons to establish information on a target at a distance. A photon, or a
little cluster of photons, is distributed towards the target. The photons are
absorbed and reemitted from the target and into the receiver. The measurement
process may be executed in two alternative ways. One can perform an
interferometric measurement (or phase measurement) on the photon, or one can
simply count the number of photons that return. the previous method is named
Interferometric Quantum Radar, and therefore the latter method is termed
Quantum Illumination. For either of those methods, one can use stationary
quantum states of photons or use entangled states. Its been shown that
entangled states provide the most effective possible boost in resolution,
achieving within the ideal case. The benefit of using quantum states is that
they exhibit extra degrees of correlation by which to get information compared
to classical methods. These extra correlations (called quantum correlations)
serve to boost the resolution and signal/noise (SNR) that may be achieved
within the radar system.

DRAM in access latency. One avenue for its adoption is to employ it in place of
persistent storage; another is to use it as a cheaper and denser extension of
DRAM. In pursuit of the latter goal, we present the design of a volatile Optane
NVRAM cache as a component in a storage engine underlying MongoDB. The primary
innovation in our design is a new cache admission policy. We discover that on
Optane NVRAM, known for its limited write throughput, the presence of writes
disproportionately affects the throughput of reads, much more so than on DRAM.
Therefore, an admission policy that indiscriminately admits new data (and thus
generates writes), severely limits the rate of data retrieval and results in
exceedingly poor performance for the cache overall. We design an admission
policy that balances the rate of admission with the rate of lookups using
dynamically observed characteristics of the workload. Our implementation
outperforms OpenCAS (an off-the-shelf Optane-based block cache) in all cases,
and Intel Memory Mode in cases where the database size exceeds the available
NVRAM. Our cache is decoupled from the rest of the storage engine and uses
generic metrics to guide its admission policy; therefore our design can be
easily adopted in other systems.

Specifically,

discuss a few of these challenges and the techniques, such as the use of
Fourier transform, that can be used to resolve these issues. This paper
proposes and develops a physics-informed neural network model that combines the
residuals of the strong form and the potential energy, yielding many loss terms
contributing to the definition of the loss function to be minimized. Hence, we
propose using the coefficient of variation weighting scheme to dynamically and
adaptively assign the weight for each loss term in the loss function. The
developed PINN model is standalone and meshfree. In other words, it can
accurately capture the mechanical response without requiring any labeled data.
Although the framework can be used for many solid mechanics problems, we focus
on three-dimensional (3D) hyperelasticity, where we consider two hyperelastic
models. Once the model is trained, the response can be obtained almost
instantly at any point in the physical domain, given its spatial coordinates.
We demonstrate the framework's performance by solving different problems with
various boundary conditions.

focused on Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm.
CTDE has been a dominant approach for both cooperative and mixed environments
due to its capability to efficiently train decentralized policies. While in
mixed environments full autonomy of the agents can be a desirable outcome,
cooperative environments allow agents to share information to facilitate
coordination. Approaches that leverage this technique are usually referred as
communication methods, as full autonomy of agents is compromised for better
performance. Although communication approaches have shown impressive results,
they do not fully leverage this additional information during training phase.
In this paper, we propose a new method called MAMBA which utilizes Model-Based
Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) to further leverage centralized training in
cooperative environments. We argue that communication between agents is enough
to sustain a world model for each agent during execution phase while imaginary
rollouts can be used for training, removing the necessity to interact with the
environment. These properties yield sample efficient algorithm that can scale
gracefully with the number of agents. We empirically confirm that MAMBA
achieves good performance while reducing the number of interactions with the
environment up to an orders of magnitude compared to Model-Free
state-of-the-art approaches in challenging domains of SMAC and Flatland.

indeed affect both average satisfaction from and acceptance of the outcome in

case) is the least desirable choice for the participant. A comparative analysis
reveals that the automatically generated explanations result in similar levels

alternative of crowdsourced explanations, hence eliminating the need to keep
humans in the loop. Furthermore, the automatically generated explanations
significantly reduce participants' belief that a different winner should have

objective is often unclear, i.e., we do not optimize the expected fitness.
Further, while these algorithms typically produce a high-quality mean estimate
of the search distribution, the produced samples can have poor quality as these
algorithms are ignorant of the regret. Lastly, noisy fitness function
evaluations may result in solutions that are highly sub-optimal on expectation.
In contrast, stochastic optimizers that are motivated by policy gradients, such
as the Model-based Relative Entropy Stochastic Search (MORE) algorithm,
directly optimize the expected fitness function without the use of rankings.
MORE can be derived by applying natural policy gradients and compatible
function approximation, and is using information theoretic constraints to
ensure the stability of the policy update. While MORE does not suffer from the
listed limitations, it often cannot achieve state of the art performance in
comparison to ranking based methods. We improve MORE by decoupling the update
of the mean and covariance of the search distribution allowing for more
aggressive updates on the mean while keeping the update on the covariance
conservative, an improved entropy scheduling technique based on an evolution
path which results in faster convergence and a simplified and more effective
model learning approach in comparison to the original paper. We compare our
algorithm to state of the art black-box optimization algorithms on standard
optimization tasks as well as on episodic RL tasks in robotics where it is also
crucial to have small regret. We obtain competitive results on benchmark

simple-structured GNN model named SS-GNN to accurately predict DTBA. By
constructing a single undirected graph based on a distance threshold to
represent protein-ligand interactions, the scale of the graph data is greatly
reduced. Moreover, ignoring covalent bonds in the protein further reduces the
computational cost of the model. The GNN-MLP module takes the latent feature
extraction of atoms and edges in the graph as two mutually independent
processes. We also develop an edge-based atom-pair feature aggregation method
to represent complex interactions and a graph pooling-based method to predict
the binding affinity of the complex. We achieve state-of-the-art prediction
performance using a simple model (with only 0.6M parameters) without
introducing complicated geometric feature descriptions. SS-GNN achieves
Pearson's Rp=0.853 on the PDBbind v2016 core set, outperforming
state-of-the-art GNN-based methods by 5.2%. Moreover, the simplified model
structure and concise data processing procedure improve the prediction
efficiency of the model. For a typical protein-ligand complex, affinity
prediction takes only 0.2 ms. All codes are freely accessible at

manifest file to the cluster's control plane interface. This action is
typically performed through a kubectl client which is configured and authorized
to communicate with the control plane's Uniform Resource Locator (URL). An
application typically requires many Kubernetes resources such as pods,
deployments, secrets, service and volumes. Configuring each of these through
manifest files requires complex scripting, especially when there are numerous
resources needed.
  A solution to the complex management tasks is Helm. Helm provides both a tool
and underlying framework that packages the necessary manifest files. These
packages are deployed through a single step install command which abstracts all
the underlying control plane interaction from the user. Similar to application
installs through Debian's package manager dpkg, packages are shared through
local and remote repositories and allow the user to easily install, update,
delete or handle concurrent versions.

background knowledge that can help understand model decisions. Crowdsourced
rationales are provided for commonsense QA instances in popular datasets such
as CoS-E and ECQA, but their utility remains under-investigated. We present
human studies which show that ECQA rationales indeed provide additional
background information to understand a decision, while over 88% of CoS-E
rationales do not. Inspired by this finding, we ask: can the additional context
provided by free-form rationales benefit models, similar to human users? We
investigate the utility of rationales as an additional source of supervision,
by varying the quantity and quality of rationales during training. After
controlling for instances where rationales leak the correct answer while not
providing additional background knowledge, we find that incorporating only 5%
of rationales during training can boost model performance by 47.22% for CoS-E
and 57.14% for ECQA during inference. Moreover, we also show that rationale
quality matters: compared to crowdsourced rationales, T5-generated rationales
provide not only weaker supervision to models, but are also not helpful for
humans in aiding model interpretability.

main source of knowledge about current events for the masses, makes it possible
to spread disinformation on a larger scale than ever before. Consequently,
there is a need to develop novel fake news detection approaches capable of
adapting to changing factual contexts and generalizing previously or
concurrently acquired knowledge. To deal with this problem, we propose a
lifelong learning-inspired approach, which allows for fake news detection in
multiple languages and the mutual transfer of knowledge acquired in each of
them. Both classical feature extractors, such as Term frequency-inverse
document frequency or Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and integrated deep NLP
(Natural Language Processing) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) models paired with MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) classifier, were
employed. The results of experiments conducted on two datasets dedicated to the
fake news classification task (in English and Spanish, respectively), supported
by statistical analysis, confirmed that utilization of additional languages
could improve performance for traditional methods. Also, in some cases
supplementing the deep learning method with classical ones can positively
impact obtained results. The ability of models to generalize the knowledge
acquired between the analyzed languages was also observed.

also provide experimental results of the fabrication of multi-phases
Na-beta""-alumina+20mol% Scandia Doped Ceria(20SDC) as simultaneous sodium and
oxygen ion conductor by a cost-effective vapor phase process demonstrating
higher conductivity achieved in a much shorter time than other published
results. In this study, two-phase contiguous composites of Al2O3+20SDC are
fabricated by conventional ceramic processing and sintering in the air at 1400C
1500C, and 1600C, for 3 hours. The samples are heat-treated while exposed to a
sodium oxide vapor source at different time lengths. The conversion mechanism
involves coupled transport of sodium ions through newly formed Na-beta""-alumina
and oxygen ions through 20SDC. The experimental data are analyzed using
diffraction and spectroscopy methods. The samples with finer grains show faster
kinetics compared to coarse microstructures due to the presence of more
extended triple-phase boundaries (TPB). As a result, the total conductivity of
the multi-phase sample compared to that of pure 20SDC is improved by three
times, while fabrication time is decreased by 60% compared to
Na-beta""-alumina+YSZ.

monotonous way, where the questions in the database may be classified into
Bloom's Taxonomy as varying levels in complexity from basic knowledge to
advanced evaluation. The questions asked in these exams to all learners are
very much static. It becomes important to ask new questions with different
difficulty levels to each learner to provide a personalized learning
experience. In this paper, we propose a multi-task method with an interactive
attention mechanism, Qdiff, for jointly predicting Bloom's Taxonomy and
difficulty levels of academic questions. We model the interaction between the
predicted bloom taxonomy representations and the input representations using an
attention mechanism to aid in difficulty prediction. The proposed learning
method would help learn representations that capture the relationship between
Bloom's taxonomy and difficulty labels. The proposed multi-task method learns a
good input representation by leveraging the relationship between the related
tasks and can be used in similar settings where the tasks are related. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than training only
on difficulty prediction. However, Bloom's labels may not always be given for
some datasets. Hence we soft label another dataset with a model fine-tuned to
predict Bloom's labels to demonstrate the applicability of our method to
datasets with only difficulty labels.
