gravitational theory, also known as $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{T})$
gravity. Alternatively, this theory is also called $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{T},
\mathcal{G})$ gravity. The symbols $\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G}$, and
$\mathcal{T}$ denote the Ricci Scalar, the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. We suggested several
plausible models in the framework of this new gravity theory, and then used
these models to explore several physical properties of compact objects of
relativistic nature. This research also takes into account three famous compact
stars: Vela X-1 (CS1); SAXJ1808.4-3658 (CS2); and 4U1820-30 (CS3). Moreover,
using the suggested models, the physical nature of anisotropic stress, energy
density, various energy conditions (ECs), the state of equilibrium, interior
stability, mass variations, compactness, anisotropy, electric charge, and
electric field intensity are analysed for considered compact stars. Different
plots of the above-mentioned quantities are presented for this analysis.
Conclusively, the ECs are satisfied, and the compact stars have a significant
dense core.

  to suppress the confirmation bias",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain Adaptation of Black-box Predictors (DABP) aims to learn a model on an
unlabeled target domain supervised by a black-box predictor trained on a source
domain. It does not require access to both the source-domain data and the
predictor parameters, thus addressing the data privacy and portability issues
of standard domain adaptation. Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on model
distillation from the black-box predictor, \emph{i.e.}, training the model with
its noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the
confirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises. To mitigate such
bias, we propose a new method, named BETA, to incorporate knowledge
distillation and noisy label learning into one coherent framework. This is
enabled by a new divide-to-adapt strategy. BETA divides the target domain into
an easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain. Then
it deploys mutually-teaching twin networks to filter the predictor errors for
each other and improve them progressively, from the easy to hard subdomains. As
such, BETA effectively purifies the noisy labels and reduces error
accumulation. We theoretically show that the target error of BETA is minimized
by decreasing the noise ratio of the subdomains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate BETA outperforms existing methods on all DABP benchmarks, and is
even comparable with the standard domain adaptation methods that use the
source-domain data.

interstitial impurities are investigated by first-principles. In order to
obtain thorough information on the nature of chemical bondings in these solid
systems, an accurate topological analysis is performed, through partitioning of
the electron localization function. Although the mechanism of segregation of
single light impurities, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in Si-based
systems is known, it is only in the presence of multiple segregations that the
distinctive structures of the various interstitial impurities emerge. The
structural analysis of the modified Si systems and the comparison with the
corresponding molecular structure within these solid phases provide an adequate
description of interesting properties, for which bond charges provide more
insight than bond length. It is shown that, in the presence of isovalent
carbon, all systems try to preserve the tetrahedral coordination, on the
contrary, trivalent nitrogen induces a strong local distortion to fit in the
tetrahedral Si matrix while oxygen is the impurity that segregates more easily
and more regularly. This work shows that impurities lead to local distortions
and how the electron distribution rearranges to smooth it. Overall, it shows
how the analysis of bonds and their correlation with energetics and electronic
structure is of fundamental importance for the understanding of the defects
induced properties and of the basic mechanisms that influence them.

across multiple photometric wavebands has been lacking. We have devised a new
method for the metallicity estimation of fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars in the
Gaia optical $G$ and near-infrared VISTA $K_s$ wavebands by deep learning.
First, an existing metallicity prediction method is applied to large
photometric data sets, which are then used to train long short-term memory
recurrent neural networks for the regression of the [Fe/H] to the light curves
in other wavebands. This approach allows an unbiased transfer of our accurate,
spectroscopically calibrated $I$-band formula to additional bands at the
expense of minimal additional noise. We achieve a low mean absolute error of
$0.1$ dex and high $R^2$ regression performance of $0.84$ and $0.93$ for the
$K_s$ and $G$ bands, respectively, measured by cross-validation. The resulting
predictive models are deployed on the Gaia DR2 and VVV inner-bulge RR Lyrae
catalogs. We estimate mean metallicities of $-1.35$ dex for the inner bulge and
$-1.7$ for the halo, which are significantly less than values obtained by
earlier photometric prediction methods. Using our results, we establish a
public catalog of photometric metallicities of over 60,000 Galactic RR Lyrae
stars, and provide an all-sky map of the resulting RR Lyrae metallicity
distribution. The software code used for training and deploying our recurrent
neural networks is made publicly available in the open-source domain.

challenging task in robotics and augmented reality. To address this problem, we
propose DeepRM, a novel recurrent network architecture for 6D pose refinement.
DeepRM leverages initial coarse pose estimates to render synthetic images of
target objects. The rendered images are then matched with the observed images
to predict a rigid transform for updating the previous pose estimate. This
process is repeated to incrementally refine the estimate at each iteration.
LSTM units are used to propagate information through each refinement step,
significantly improving overall performance. In contrast to many 2-stage
Perspective-n-Point based solutions, DeepRM is trained end-to-end, and uses a
scalable backbone that can be tuned via a single parameter for accuracy and
efficiency. During training, a multi-scale optical flow head is added to
predict the optical flow between the observed and synthetic images. Optical
flow prediction stabilizes the training process, and enforces the learning of
features that are relevant to the task of pose estimation. Our results
demonstrate that DeepRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely
accepted challenging datasets.

results confirm that, in an imperfect channel-estimation case, the ergodic
rates performance of the spatial suppression in the uplink outperforms those of
the SI subtraction, due to the correlation between the precoder and the

performs better under different given system constraints such as uplink and
downlink sum rates, the total transmit power, and the power scaling law.

for computational quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry
calculations on quantum computers are limited to small molecules. This
limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating
more qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a
quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a
result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make QC
practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in
benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot
provide useful predictions. We propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as
an accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic properties. We
demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis
can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular
Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the
improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational
frequencies for H$_2$ and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that
the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we
achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the
full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas
the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our
work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular
Hamiltonian for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time
demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are
possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum
computers.

uncertainty estimates for population-level quantities from DP synthetic data.
To implement NA+MI for discrete data generation using the values of marginal
queries, we develop a novel noise-aware synthetic data generation algorithm
NAPSU-MQ using the principle of maximum entropy. Our experiments demonstrate

Existing speaker verification techniques distinguish individual speakers via

paper, we explore a new direction of human voice research by scrutinizing the
unique characteristics of human speech at the ultrasound frequency band. Our

accuracy of speaker verification. We propose a speaker verification system,
SUPERVOICE that uses a two-stream DNN architecture with a feature fusion
mechanism to generate distinctive speaker models. To test the system, we create
a speech dataset with 12 hours of audio (8,950 voice samples) from 127

such as autonomous driving and surveillance. However, these models are
vulnerable in adversarial environments. Backdoor attack is emerging as a severe
security threat which injects a backdoor trigger into a small portion of
training data such that the trained model behaves normally on benign inputs but
gives incorrect predictions when the specific trigger appears. While most
research in backdoor attacks focuses on image classification, backdoor attacks
on object detection have not been explored but are of equal importance. Object
detection has been adopted as an important module in various security-sensitive
applications such as autonomous driving. Therefore, backdoor attacks on object
detection could pose severe threats to human lives and properties. We propose
four kinds of backdoor attacks for object detection task: 1) Object Generation
Attack: a trigger can falsely generate an object of the target class; 2)
Regional Misclassification Attack: a trigger can change the prediction of a
surrounding object to the target class; 3) Global Misclassification Attack: a
single trigger can change the predictions of all objects in an image to the
target class; and 4) Object Disappearance Attack: a trigger can make the
detector fail to detect the object of the target class. We develop appropriate
metrics to evaluate the four backdoor attacks on object detection. We perform
experiments using two typical object detection models -- Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3

another benign dataset cannot remove the backdoor hidden in the object
detection model. To defend against these backdoor attacks, we propose Detector

the quasar Main Sequence (MS), a parameter space that allows to connect
observed properties to the relative relevance of radiative and gravitational
forces. In the redshift range we consider, the low-ionization HI Balmer line
H\b{eta} is shifted into the near infrared. Here we present first results of a
sample of 22 high-luminosity quasars with redshift between 1.4 and 3.8.
Observations covering the H\b{eta} spectral region were collected with the IR

several polynomial-time algorithms have been designed and proven to yield
Steiner trees whose total weight is bounded within 2 times the Steiner minimal

algorithm and its MPI-based distributed implementation. In place of distance
computation between all pairs of seed vertices, an expensive phase in many
algorithms, our solution exploits Voronoi cell computation. Also, this approach
has higher parallel efficiency than others that involve minimum spanning tree
computation on the entire graph. Furthermore, our distributed design exploits
asynchronous processing and a message prioritization scheme to accelerate
convergence of distance computation, and harnesses both vertex and edge centric
processing to offer fast time-to-solution. We demonstrate scalability and
performance of our solution using real-world graphs with up to 128 billion

occur as consequences of the time reversal symmetry breaking in the considered
self-propelled systems, independently of the interaction details. In the case

quantum generative machine learning models that embed non-linear activations
into the evolution of the statevector. However, some of the most successful
classical generative models, such as those based on neural networks, involve
highly non-linear dynamics for quality training. In this paper, we explore the
effect of these dynamics in quantum generative modeling by introducing a model
that adds non-linear activations via a neural network structure onto the
standard Born Machine framework - the Quantum Neuron Born Machine (QNBM). To
achieve this, we utilize a previously introduced Quantum Neuron subroutine,
which is a repeat-until-success circuit with mid-circuit measurements and
classical control. After introducing the QNBM, we investigate how its
performance depends on network size, by training a 3-layer QNBM with 4 output
neurons and various input and hidden layer sizes. We then compare our
non-linear QNBM to the linear Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We allocate
similar time and memory resources to each model, such that the only major
difference is the qubit overhead required by the QNBM. With gradient-based
training, we show that while both models can easily learn a trivial uniform
probability distribution, on a more challenging class of distributions, the
QNBM achieves an almost 3x smaller error rate than a QCBM with a similar number
of tunable parameters. We therefore provide evidence that suggests that
non-linearity is a useful resource in quantum generative models, and we put

lack of access to quality data and the high costs associated with the

volumes of healthcare data is a continuous process. The performance of
data-hungry Deep Learning models (DL) is highly dependent on the quantity and
quality of the data. While the need for data quantity has been established
through research adequately, we show how a selection of good quality data
improves deep learning model performance. In this work, we take
Electrocardiogram (ECG) data as a case study and propose a model performance
improvement methodology for algorithm developers, that selects the most
informative data samples from incoming streams of multi-class ECG data. Our
Core-Set selection methodology uses metrics-based explanations to select the
most informative ECG data samples. This also provides an understanding (for
algorithm developers) as to why a sample was selected as more informative over
others for the improvement of deep learning model performance. Our experimental
results show a 9.67% and 8.69% precision and recall improvement with a
significant training data volume reduction of 50%. Additionally, our proposed
methodology asserts the quality and annotation of ECG samples from incoming
data streams. It allows automatic detection of individual data samples that do
not contribute to model learning thus minimizing possible negative effects on
model performance. We further discuss the potential generalizability of our
approach by experimenting with a different dataset and deep learning

non-negligible when the coefficient of friction for sliding transverse to the
body axis is small. Inertia is also significant in a few cases with relatively
large coefficients of friction for transverse and backward sliding, and here
the optimal motions are less sensitive to the inertia parameter. The optimal
motions seem to converge as the number of frequencies used is increased from
one to four. For some of the optimal motions with significant inertia we find
dramatic reductions in efficiency when the inertia parameter is decreased to
zero. For the motions that are optimal with zero inertia, the efficiency
decreases more gradually when we raise the inertia to moderate and large

traditional hand-crafted methods such as VVC intra. However, the large network
complexity prohibits the usage of LIC on resource-limited embedded systems.
Network quantization is an efficient way to reduce the network burden. This
paper presents a quantized LIC (QLIC) by channel splitting. First, we explore
that the influence of quantization error to the reconstruction error is
different for various channels. Second, we split the channels whose
quantization has larger influence to the reconstruction error. After the
splitting, the dynamic range of channels is reduced so that the quantization
error can be reduced. Finally, we prune several channels to keep the number of
overall channels as origin. By using the proposal, in the case of 8-bit
quantization for weight and activation of both main and hyper path, we can
reduce the BD-rate by 0.61%-4.74% compared with the previous QLIC. Besides, we
can reach better coding gain compared with the state-of-the-art network
quantization method when quantizing MS-SSIM models. Moreover, our proposal can
be combined with other network quantization methods to further improve the
coding gain. The moderate coding loss caused by the quantization validates the

repeatedly been reported. Even if rare, such system failures pose a serious
barrier to adoption without a rigorous risk assessment. This paper presents a
framework for the systematic and rigorous risk verification of systems. We
consider a wide range of system specifications formulated in signal temporal
logic (STL) and model the system as a stochastic process, permitting
discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. We then define the STL
robustness risk as the risk of lacking robustness against failure. This
definition is motivated as system failures are often caused by missing
robustness to modeling errors, system disturbances, and distribution shifts in
the underlying data generating process. Within the definition, we permit
general classes of risk measures and focus on tail risk measures such as the
value-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk. While the STL robustness risk
is in general hard to compute, we propose the approximate STL robustness risk
as a more tractable notion that upper bounds the STL robustness risk. We show
how the approximate STL robustness risk can accurately be estimated from system
trajectory data. For discrete-time stochastic processes, we show under which
conditions the approximate STL robustness risk can even be computed exactly. We

To answer this question, we propose a group-wise reinforcement generation
perspective. We reformulate representation space reconstruction into an
interactive process of nested feature generation and selection, where feature
generation is to generate new meaningful and explicit features, and feature
selection is to eliminate redundant features to control feature sizes. We
develop a cascading reinforcement learning method that leverages three
cascading Markov Decision Processes to learn optimal generation policies to
automate the selection of features and operations and the feature crossing. We
design a group-wise generation strategy to cross a feature group, an operation,
and another feature group to generate new features and find the strategy that
can enhance exploration efficiency and augment reward signals of cascading
agents. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness, efficiency, traceability, and explicitness of our system.

transmit task-related information only, yielding significant performance gains

multi-cell multi-task network in this paper. Specifically, an approximate
measure of semantic entropy is first developed to quantify the semantic
information for different tasks, based on which a novel quality-of-experience
(QoE) model is proposed. We formulate the QoE-aware semantic resource
allocation in terms of the number of transmitted semantic symbols, channel
assignment, and power allocation. To solve this problem, we first decouple it
into two independent subproblems. The first one is to optimize the number of
transmitted semantic symbols with given channel assignment and power
allocation, which is solved by the exhaustive searching method. The second one
is the channel assignment and power allocation subproblem, which is modeled as
a many-to-one matching game and solved by the proposed low-complexity matching
algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method on the overall QoE.

limited generation capacity of power stations. Many countries adopt the common
practice of routine load shedding - disconnecting entire regions from the power

in inflicting hardship and discomfort on households, which is even worse and
hence unfair to those whose need for electricity is higher than that of others
during load shedding hours. Recently, Oluwasuji et al. [2020] presented this
problem and suggested several heuristic solutions. In this work, we study the
electricity distribution problem as a problem of fair division, model it using
the related literature on cake-cutting problems, and discuss some insights on
which parts of the time intervals are allocated to each household. We consider
four cases: identical demand, uniform utilities; identical demand, additive
utilities; different demand, uniform utilities; different demand, additive
utilities. We provide the solution for the first two cases and discuss the
novel concept of q-times bin packing in relation to the remaining cases. We
also show how the fourth case is related to the consensus k-division problem.
One can study objectives and constraints using utilitarian and egalitarian
social welfare metrics, as well as trying to keep the number of cuts as small
as possible. A secondary objective can be to minimize the maximum

estimation increased in almost two times in comparison with Gaia DR2. Due to

provide fast access to data stored in large, slow memory. The temporal aspect
of locality is extremely well studied and understood, but the spatial aspect
much less so. We seek to gain an increased understanding of spatial locality by
defining and studying the Granularity-Change Caching Problem. This problem
modifies the traditional caching setup by grouping data items into blocks, such
that a cache can choose any subset of a block to load for the same cost as
loading any individual item in the block.
  We show that modeling such spatial locality significantly changes the caching
problem. This begins with a proof that Granularity-Change Caching is
NP-Complete in the offline setting, even when all items have unit size and all
blocks have unit load cost. In the online setting, we show a lower bound for
competitive ratios of deterministic policies that is significantly worse than
traditional caching. Moreover, we present a deterministic replacement policy
called Item-Block Layered Partitioning and show that it obtains a competitive
ratio close to that lower bound. Moreover, our bounds reveal a new issue
arising in the Granularity-Change Caching Problem where the choice of offline
cache size affects the competitiveness of different online algorithms relative
to one another. To deal with this issue, we extend a prior (temporal) locality
model to account for spatial locality, and provide a general lower bound in
addition to an upper bound for Item-Block Layered Partitioning.

are many sets of synaptic connections that are consistent with the task.
However, only a small number of possible solutions are robust to noise in the
input and are capable of generalizing their performance of the task to new
inputs. Finding such good solutions is an important goal of learning systems in
general and neuronal circuits in particular. For systems operating with static
inputs and outputs, a well known approach to the problem is the large margin
methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). By maximizing the distance of
the data vectors from the decision surface, these solutions enjoy increased
robustness to noise and enhanced generalization abilities. Furthermore, the use
of the kernel method enables SVMs to perform classification tasks that require
nonlinear decision surfaces. However, for dynamical systems with event based
outputs, such as spiking neural networks and other continuous time threshold
crossing systems, this optimality criterion is inapplicable due to the strong
temporal correlations in their input and output. We introduce a novel extension
of the static SVMs - The Temporal Support Vector Machine (T-SVM). The T-SVM
finds a solution that maximizes a new construct - the dynamical margin. We show
that T-SVM and its kernel extensions generate robust synaptic weight vectors in

local information privacy (LIP) to enhance data utility. To protect the
sensitive features $S$ correlated with some useful data $X$, LIP restricts the
lift, the ratio of the posterior belief to the prior on $S$ after and before
accessing $X$. For each $x$, both maximum and minimum lift over sensitive
features are measures of the privacy risk of publishing this symbol and should
be restricted for the privacy-preserving purpose. Previous works enforce the
same bound for both max-lift and min-lift. However, empirical observations show
that the min-lift is usually much smaller than the max-lift. In this work, we
generalize the LIP definition to consider the unequal values of max and min
lift, i.e., considering different bounds for max-lift and min-lift. This new
definition is applied to the watchdog privacy mechanism. We demonstrate that
the utility is enhanced under a given privacy constraint on local differential
privacy. At the same time, the resulting max-lift is lower and, therefore,
tightly restricts other privacy leakages, e.g., mutual information, maximal
leakage, and $\alpha$-leakage.

unbiased estimators for TTE that do not rely on any prior structural knowledge
of the network, as long as the network interference effects are constrained to
low-degree interactions among neighbors of an individual. We derive bounds on
the variance of the estimators, and we show in experiments that our estimator
performs well against baselines on simulated data. Central to our theoretical

bound on the representation similarity of the value functions of two adjacent

for the numerical solution of the Ripa model -- a generalization of the shallow
water equations that accounts for effects of water temperature variations.
Thermodynamic processes are important particularly in the upper layers of the
ocean where the variations of sea surface temperature play a fundamental role
in climate change. The well-balance property which requires numerical schemes
to preserve the lake-at-rest steady state is crucial to the simulation of
perturbation waves over that steady state such as waves on a lake or tsunami
waves in the deep ocean. To ensure the well-balance, positivity-preserving, and
high-order properties, a DG-interpolation scheme (with or without scaling
positivity-preserving limiter) and special treatments pertaining to the Ripa
model are employed in the transfer of both the flow variables and bottom
topography from the old mesh to the new one and in the TVB limiting process.
Mesh adaptivity is realized using an MMPDE moving mesh approach and a metric
tensor based on an equilibrium variable and water depth. A motivation is to
adapt the mesh according to both the perturbations of the lake-at-rest steady
state and the water depth distribution (bottom structure). Numerical examples
in one and two dimensions are presented to demonstrate the well-balance,
high-order accuracy, and positivity-preserving properties of the method and its
ability to capture small perturbations of the lake-at-rest steady state.

are inferred to be significantly smaller than the typical value of the
interstellar medium (ISM). The anisotropic diffusion model ascribes the slow
diffusion to the cross-field diffusion assuming sub-Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence in
the ISM around the pulsar if the viewing angle between the observer's
line-of-sight (LOS) to the pulsar and the local mean field direction is small.
In general, the TeV halo's morphology under this model highly depends on the
viewing angle, and an elongated, asymmetric morphology is predicted if the LOS
is not approximately aligned with the local mean field direction. While the
specific requirement of a small viewing angle is supposedly established only
for a small fraction of TeV halos, TeV halos with apparent asymmetric
morphology has not been detected. In this paper we will study the expectation
of TeV halos measured by the TeV-PeV gamma-ray detector LHAASO in the framework
of anisotropic diffusion model, with a particular focus on the influence of the
viewing angle on the detectability. We show that a TeV halo is more detectable
with a smaller viewing angle and this selection effect may explain why the
morphologies of all three detected TeV halos so far are consistent being
spherical. We also demonstrate that LHAASO is capable of detecting asymmetric
TeV halos after several-year operation with reasonable source parameters. This
can serve as a critical test of the anisotropic diffusion model.

labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Owing to privacy concerns
and heavy data transmission, source-free UDA, exploiting the pre-trained source
models instead of the raw source data for target learning, has been gaining
popularity in recent years. Some works attempt to recover unseen source domains
with generative models, however introducing additional network parameters.
Other works propose to fine-tune the source model by pseudo labels, while noisy
pseudo labels may misguide the decision boundary, leading to unsatisfied
results. To tackle these issues, we propose an effective method named
Proxy-based Mixup training with label refinery (ProxyMix). First of all, to
avoid additional parameters and explore the information in the source model,
ProxyMix defines the weights of the classifier as the class prototypes and then
constructs a class-balanced proxy source domain by the nearest neighbors of the
prototypes to bridge the unseen source domain and the target domain. To improve
the reliability of pseudo labels, we further propose the frequency-weighted
aggregation strategy to generate soft pseudo labels for unlabeled target data.
The proposed strategy exploits the internal structure of target features, pulls
target features to their semantic neighbors, and increases the weights of
low-frequency classes samples during gradient updating. With the proxy domain
and the reliable pseudo labels, we employ two kinds of mixup regularization,
i.e., inter- and intra-domain mixup, in our framework, to align the proxy and
the target domain, enforcing the consistency of predictions, thereby further
mitigating the negative impacts of noisy labels. Experiments on three 2D image
and one 3D point cloud object recognition benchmarks demonstrate that ProxyMix
yields state-of-the-art performance for source-free UDA tasks.

AI algorithms. A large body of work (including normalizing flows and Bayesian
neural networks) has been devoted to describing the entire predictive
distribution (PD) of a target variable Y given input features $\mathbf{X}$.
However, off-the-shelf PDs are usually far from being conditionally calibrated;
i.e., the probability of occurrence of an event given input $\mathbf{X}$ can be
significantly different from the predicted probability. Most current research
on predictive inference (such as conformal prediction) concerns constructing
calibrated prediction sets only. It is often believed that the problem of
obtaining and assessing entire conditionally calibrated PDs is too challenging.
In this work, we show that recalibration, as well as diagnostics of entire PDs,
are indeed attainable goals in practice. Our proposed method relies on the idea
of regressing probability integral transform (PIT) scores against $\mathbf{X}$.
This regression gives full diagnostics of conditional coverage across the
entire feature space and can be used to recalibrate misspecified PDs. We
benchmark our corrected prediction bands against oracle bands and
state-of-the-art predictive inference algorithms for synthetic data, including
settings with a distributional shift. Finally, we produce calibrated PDs for
two applications: (i) probabilistic nowcasting based on sequences of satellite

existing teacher assistant-based methods require maximally many trials before

distillation schedule (MiniDisc) for scheduling the optimal teacher assistant
in minimally one trial. In particular, motivated by the finding that the
performance of the student is positively correlated to the scale-performance
tradeoff of the teacher assistant, MiniDisc is designed with a
$\lambda$-tradeoff to measure the optimality of the teacher assistant without
trial distillation to the student. MiniDisc then can schedule the optimal
teacher assistant with the best $\lambda$-tradeoff in a sandwich framework.
MiniDisc is evaluated with an extensive set of experiments on GLUE.
Experimental results demonstrate the improved efficiency our MiniDisc compared

pretrains in a number of source tasks to discover a shared representation,
which is subsequently used to learn a good policy in a \emph{target task}. We
propose a new notion of task relatedness between source and target tasks, and
develop a novel approach for representational transfer under this assumption.
Concretely, we show that given generative access to source tasks, we can
discover a representation, using which subsequent linear RL techniques quickly
converge to a near-optimal policy in the target task.
  The sample complexity is close to knowing the ground truth features in the
target task, and comparable to prior representation learning results in the
source tasks. We complement our positive results with lower bounds without
generative access, and validate our findings with empirical evaluation on rich
observation MDPs that require deep exploration. In our experiments, we observe
a speed up in learning in the target by pre-training, and also validate the
need for generative access in source tasks.

second-price auctions to first-price auctions. Although there has been a line
of works concerning online bidding strategies in first-price auctions, it still
remains open how to handle budget constraints in the problem. In the present
paper, we initiate the study for a buyer with budgets to learn online bidding
strategies in repeated first-price auctions. We propose an RL-based bidding
algorithm against the optimal non-anticipating strategy under stationary
competition. Our algorithm obtains $\widetilde O(\sqrt T)$-regret if the bids
are all revealed at the end of each round. With the restriction that the buyer
only sees the winning bid after each round, our modified algorithm obtains
$\widetilde O(T^{\frac{7}{12}})$-regret by techniques developed from survival
analysis. Our analysis extends to the more general scenario where the buyer has
any bounded instantaneous utility function with regrets of the same order.

such comprehensive structures more complete and regularized reconstructions can
be achieved. We solve the complex generation problem in two steps. First, we
propose a novel neural framework that consists of a sparse CNN encoder for

raindrop locations, and then use inpainting techniques or generative networks
to recover the background behind raindrops. Yet, as adherent raindrops are
diverse in sizes and appearances, the detection is challenging for both single
image and video. Moreover, unlike rain streaks, adherent raindrops tend to
cover the same area in several frames. Addressing these problems, our method
employs a two-stage video-based raindrop removal method. The first stage is the
single image module, which generates initial clean results. The second stage is
the multiple frame module, which further refines the initial results using
temporal constraints, namely, by utilizing multiple input frames in our process
and applying temporal consistency between adjacent output frames. Our single
image module employs a raindrop removal network to generate initial raindrop
removal results, and create a mask representing the differences between the
input and initial output. Once the masks and initial results for consecutive
frames are obtained, our multiple-frame module aligns the frames in both the
image and feature levels and then obtains the clean background. Our method
initially employs optical flow to align the frames, and then utilizes
deformable convolution layers further to achieve feature-level frame alignment.
To remove small raindrops and recover correct backgrounds, a target frame is
predicted from adjacent frames. A series of unsupervised losses are proposed so
that our second stage, which is the video raindrop removal module, can
self-learn from video data without ground truths. Experimental results on real
videos demonstrate the state-of-art performance of our method both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

and the spin-orbit torque. While the method of spectral moments allows us in
principle to compute these quantities directly at finite temperatures, the
standard two-pole approximation can be applied only to Hamiltonians that are
effectively of single-band type. We do a first step to explore if the method of
spectral moments may replace the LDA+U method in first-principles calculations
of correlated solids with many bands in cases where the direct assessment of
the temperature dependence of equilibrium and response functions is desired:
The spectral moments of many-band Hamiltonians of correlated electrons do not
commute and therefore they do not possess a system of common eigenvectors. We
show that nevertheless the spectral function may be constructed from the
spectral moments by solving a system of coupled non-linear equations.
Additionally, we show how to compute the anomalous Hall conductivity of
correlated electrons from this spectral function. We demonstrate the method for
the Hubbard-Rashba model, where the standard two-pole approximation cannot be
applied, because spin-orbit interaction (SOI)couples the spin-up and the
spin-down bands. In the quest for new quantum states that arise from the
combination of SOI and correlation effects, the Hartree-Fock approximation is
frequently used to obtain a first approximation for the phase diagram. We
propose that using the many-band generalization of the selfconsistent moment
method instead of Hartree-Fock in such exploratory model calculations may
improve the accuracy significantly, while keeping the computational burden low.

developed to provide rich knowledge about various domains. An ontology consists
of an ABox, i.e., assertion axioms between two entities or between a concept
and an entity, and a TBox, i.e., terminology axioms between two concepts.
Neural logical reasoning (NLR) is a fundamental task to explore such knowledge
bases, which aims at answering multi-hop queries with logical operations based

methods can give specific entity-level answers, i.e., ABox answers, they are
not able to provide descriptive concept-level answers, i.e., TBox answers,
where each concept is a description of a set of entities. In other words,
previous NLR methods only reason over the ABox of an ontology while ignoring
the TBox. In particular, providing TBox answers enables inferring the
explanations of each query with descriptive concepts, which make answers
comprehensible to users and are of great usefulness in the field of applied

solution named TAR for TA-NLR. Firstly, we incorporate description logic based
ontological axioms to provide the source of concepts. Then, we represent
concepts and queries as fuzzy sets, i.e., sets whose elements have degrees of
membership, to bridge concepts and queries with entities. Moreover, we design
operators involving concepts on top of fuzzy set representation of concepts and
queries for optimization and inference. Extensive experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TAR for TA-NLR.

methods in traffic forecasting. However, the prediction of origin-destination
(OD) demands is still a challenging problem since the number of OD pairs is
usually quadratic to the number of stations. In this case, most of the existing
spatiotemporal methods fail to handle spatial relations on such a large scale.
To address this problem, this paper provides a dynamic graph representation
learning framework for OD demands prediction. In particular, a hierarchical
memory updater is first proposed to maintain a time-aware representation for
each node, and the representations are updated according to the most recently
observed OD trips in continuous-time and multiple discrete-time ways. Second, a
spatiotemporal propagation mechanism is provided to aggregate representations
of neighbor nodes along a random spatiotemporal route which treats origin and
destination as two different semantic entities. Last, an objective function is
designed to derive the future OD demands according to the most recent node
representations, and also to tackle the data sparsity problem in OD prediction.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, and the
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The

susceptible to dataset bias, the strong correlation between peripheral
attributes of data samples and a target class. For example, even if the frog
class in the dataset mainly consists of frog images with a swamp background
(i.e., bias-aligned samples), a debiased classifier should be able to correctly
classify a frog at a beach (i.e., bias-conflicting samples). Recent debiasing
approaches commonly use two components for debiasing, a biased model $f_B$ and
a debiased model $f_D$. $f_B$ is trained to focus on bias-aligned samples
(i.e., overfitted to the bias) while $f_D$ is mainly trained with
bias-conflicting samples by concentrating on samples which $f_B$ fails to
learn, leading $f_D$ to be less susceptible to the dataset bias. While the
state-of-the-art debiasing techniques have aimed to better train $f_D$, we
focus on training $f_B$, an overlooked component until now. Our empirical
analysis reveals that removing the bias-conflicting samples from the training
set for $f_B$ is important for improving the debiasing performance of $f_D$.
This is due to the fact that the bias-conflicting samples work as noisy samples
for amplifying the bias for $f_B$ since those samples do not include the bias
attribute. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective data sample selection
method which removes the bias-conflicting samples to construct a bias-amplified
dataset for training $f_B$. Our data sample selection method can be directly
applied to existing reweighting-based debiasing approaches, obtaining
consistent performance boost and achieving the state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent

joint optimization of power allocation, active and passive beamforming is
investigated to maximize the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), taking into
account the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of all channels. For ES,
by approximating the semi-infinite constraints with the S-procedure and general
sign-definiteness, the problem is solved by an alternating optimization
framework. Besides, the proposed algorithm is extended to the MS protocol by
solving a mixed-integer non-convex problem. While for TS, a two-layer iterative
method is proposed. Simulation results show that: 1) The proposed STAR-RIS
assisted NOMA networks are able to provide up to 33.6\% higher SEE than
conventional RIS counterparts; 2) TS and ES protocols are generally preferable
for low and high power domain, respectively; 3) The accuracy of CSI estimation

otherwise, the final entanglement wedge contains two separated islands. In the
former case, the entanglement wedge of the two black holes forms at the time

unitarity of the evolution is preserved. When the sizes of two black holes are

Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) clusters coupled to a Majorana chain, which resemble
two black holes connected by a radiation region. We numerically compute the

which is inaccessible in many applications. Data augmentation (DA) tackles data
scarcity by creating new labelled data from available ones. Different DA
methods have different mechanisms and therefore using their generated labelled
data for DNN training may help improving DNN's generalisation to different
degrees. Combining multiple DA methods, namely multi-DA, for DNN training,
provides a way to boost generalisation. Among existing multi-DA based DNN
training methods, those relying on knowledge distillation (KD) have received
great attention. They leverage knowledge transfer to utilise the labelled data
sets created by multiple DA methods instead of directly combining them for
training DNNs. However, existing KD-based methods can only utilise certain
types of DA methods, incapable of utilising the advantages of arbitrary DA
methods. We propose a general multi-DA based DNN training framework capable to
use arbitrary DA methods. To train a DNN, our framework replicates a certain
portion in the latter part of the DNN into multiple copies, leading to multiple
DNNs with shared blocks in their former parts and independent blocks in their
latter parts. Each of these DNNs is associated with a unique DA and a newly
devised loss that allows comprehensively learning from the data generated by
all DA methods and the outputs from all DNNs in an online and adaptive way. The
overall loss, i.e., the sum of each DNN's loss, is used for training the DNN.
Eventually, one of the DNNs with the best validation performance is chosen for
inference. We implement the proposed framework by using three distinct DA
methods and apply it for training representative DNNs. Experiments on the
popular benchmarks of image classification demonstrate the superiority of our
method to several existing single-DA and multi-DA based training methods.

stability analysis when initiated from a state where a perturbation is added to

An acceleration method is developed by introducing time dependence in the

trajectory and the solution of its corresponding Neural ODE. Our bound is tight
and, on the negative side, does not go to 0 with depth N if the residual
functions are not smooth with depth. On the positive side, we show that this
smoothness is preserved by gradient descent for a ResNet with linear residual

towards a limit Neural ODE at rate 1 over N, uniformly with depth and
optimization time. As a byproduct of our analysis, we consider the use of a
memory-free discrete adjoint method to train a ResNet by recovering the
activations on the fly through a backward pass of the network, and show that
this method theoretically succeeds at large depth if the residual functions are
Lipschitz with the input. We then show that Heun's method, a second order ODE

validate that our adjoint method succeeds at large depth, and that Heun method

confidence levels is a central but difficult task in high-dimension. Despite
the core role of sparse logistic regression in statistics and machine learning,
it still lacks a good solution for accurate inference in the regime where the
number of features $p$ is as large as or larger than the number of samples $n$.
Here, we tackle this problem by improving the Conditional Randomization Test
(CRT). The original CRT algorithm shows promise as a way to output p-values
while making few assumptions on the distribution of the test statistics. As it
comes with a prohibitive computational cost even in mildly high-dimensional
problems, faster solutions based on distillation have been proposed. Yet, they
rely on unrealistic hypotheses and result in low-power solutions. To improve
this, we propose \emph{CRT-logit}, an algorithm that combines a
variable-distillation step and a decorrelation step that takes into account the
geometry of $\ell_1$-penalized logistic regression problem. We provide a
theoretical analysis of this procedure, and demonstrate its effectiveness on
simulations, along with experiments on large-scale brain-imaging and genomics

transition on several models of random graphs with regular and random
connectivity. The unprecedented precision and abundance of our exact
diagonalization data (both spectra and eigenstates), together with new finite
size scaling and statistical analysis of the graph ensembles, unveils a
universal behavior which is described by two simple, integer, scaling
exponents. A by-product of such analysis is a reconciliation of the tension
between the results of perturbation theory coming from strong disorder and
earlier numerical works, which seemed to suggest that there should be a
non-ergodic region above a given value of disorder $W_{E}$ which is strictly
less than the Anderson localization critical disorder $W_C$, and that of other
works which suggest that there is no such region. We find that, although no
separate $W_{E}$ exists from $W_C$, the length scale at which fully developed
ergodicity is found diverges like $|W-W_C|^{-1}$, while the critical length
over which delocalization develops is $\sim |W-W_C|^{-1/2}$. The separation of
these two scales at the critical point allows for a true non-ergodic,
delocalized region. In addition, by looking at eigenstates and studying leading
and sub-leading terms in system size-dependence of participation entropies, we
show that the former contain information about the non-ergodicity volume which
becomes non-trivial already deep in the delocalized regime. We also discuss the
quantitative similarities between the Anderson transition on random graphs and
many-body localization transition.

the optical transparency of the target channel can be actively manipulated by
steering the optical detuning in the control channel. By adopting a

which one corresponds to Rydberg blockade and an emergent one results from

different from conventional electromagnetically induced transparency realized

can be generalized to multi-channel settings. Moreover, we demonstrate that
such a FIT permits to realize controllable single-photon switches, which also

CGNN belongs to an infinite-dimensional function space. The architecture is
inspired by DCGAN, with one fully connected layer, several convolutional layers
and nonlinear activation functions. In the continuous $L^2$ setting, the
dimensions of the spaces of each layer are replaced by the scales of a
multiresolution analysis of a compactly supported wavelet. We present
conditions on the convolutional filters and on the nonlinearity that guarantee
that a CGNN is injective. This theory finds applications to inverse problems,
and allows for deriving Lipschitz stability estimates for (possibly nonlinear)
infinite-dimensional inverse problems with unknowns belonging to the manifold
generated by a CGNN. Several numerical simulations, including signal
deblurring, illustrate and validate this approach.

  Induction of Physics into Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)","26 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, the gap between Deep Learning (DL) methods and analytical or
numerical approaches in scientific computing is tried to be filled by the
evolution of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, still, there
are many complications in the training of PINNs and optimal interleaving of
physical models. Here, we introduced the concept of Physical Activation
Functions (PAFs). This concept offers that instead of using general activation
functions (AFs) such as ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid for all the neurons, one can
use generic AFs that their mathematical expression is inherited from the
physical laws of the investigating phenomena. The formula of PAFs may be
inspired by the terms in the analytical solution of the problem. We showed that
the PAFs can be inspired by any mathematical formula related to the
investigating phenomena such as the initial or boundary conditions of the PDE
system. We validated the advantages of PAFs for several PDEs including the
harmonic oscillations, Burgers, Advection-Convection equation, and the
heterogeneous diffusion equations. The main advantage of PAFs was in the more
efficient constraining and interleaving of PINNs with the investigating
physical phenomena and their underlying mathematical models. This added
constraint significantly improved the predictions of PINNs for the testing data
that was out-of-training distribution. Furthermore, the application of PAFs
reduced the size of the PINNs up to 75% in different cases. Also, the value of
loss terms was reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in some cases which is
noteworthy for upgrading the training of the PINNs. The iterations required for
finding the optimum values were also significantly reduced. It is concluded
that using the PAFs helps in generating PINNs with less complexity and much
more validity for longer ranges of prediction.

only a fraction of the relevant hyperlinks, mainly because this is a time
consuming task. In this paper we address an annotation, which we refer to as
anchor prediction. Even though it is conceptually close to link prediction or
entity linking, it is a different task that require developing a specific
method to solve it. Given a source document and a target document, this task
consists in automatically identifying anchors in the source document, i.e words
or terms that should carry a hyperlink pointing towards the target document. We
propose a contextualized relational topic model, CRTM, that models directed
links between documents as a function of the local context of the anchor in the
source document and the whole content of the target document. The model can be
used to predict anchors in a source document, given the target document,
without relying on a dictionary of previously seen mention or title, nor any
external knowledge graph. Authors can benefit from CRTM, by letting it
automatically suggest hyperlinks, given a new document and the set of target
document to connect to. It can also benefit to readers, by dynamically
inserting hyperlinks between the documents they're reading. Experiments
conducted on several Wikipedia corpora (in English, Italian and German)

expressions for the intensity of radiation and the inclusive probability to
record a photon are obtained. It is found that there are three processes in
this order of perturbation theory where the electron wave packet radiates

radiation produced by an electron wave packet traversing a mirror and
backlighted by a laser wave, reradiation of photons in a coherent state by an

through four fluxes: precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and atmospheric
moisture convergence (net import of water vapor to balance runoff). Each of
these processes is essential for human and ecosystem well-being. Predicting how
the water cycle responds to changes in vegetation cover remains a challenge.
Recently, changes in plant transpiration across the Amazon basin were shown to
be associated disproportionately with changes in rainfall, suggesting that even
small declines in transpiration (e.g., from deforestation) would lead to much
larger declines in rainfall. Here, constraining these results by the law of
mass conservation, we show that in a sufficiently wet atmosphere, forest
transpiration can control atmospheric moisture convergence such that increased
transpiration enhances atmospheric moisture import and resulting water yield.
Conversely, in a sufficiently dry atmosphere increased transpiration reduces
atmospheric moisture convergence and water yield. This previously unrecognized
dichotomy can explain the otherwise mixed observations of how water yield
responds to re-greening, as we illustrate with examples from China's Loess
Plateau. Our analysis indicates that any additional precipitation recycling by
additional vegetation increases precipitation but decreases local water yield
and steady-state runoff. Therefore, in the drier regions and early stages of
ecological restoration, the role of vegetation can be confined to precipitation
recycling, while once a wetter stage is achieved, additional vegetation
enhances atmospheric moisture convergence and water yield. Evaluating the
transition between regimes, and recognizing the potential of vegetation for
enhancing moisture convergence, are crucial for characterizing the consequences
of deforestation and for motivating and guiding ecological restoration.

mitigate these costs, the processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm moves computation
closer to where the data resides, reducing (and in some cases eliminating) the
need to move data between memory and the processor. There are two main
approaches to PIM: (1) processing-near-memory (PnM), where PIM logic is added
to the same die as memory or to the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory; and (2)
processing-using-memory (PuM), which uses the operational principles of memory

the benefits of PnM and PuM for a wide range of workloads from different
domains. However, fully adopting PIM in commercial systems is still very
challenging due to the lack of tools and system support for PIM architectures
across the computer architecture stack, which includes: (i) workload
characterization methodologies and benchmark suites targeting PIM
architectures; (ii) frameworks that can facilitate the implementation of
complex operations and algorithms using the underlying PIM primitives; (iii)
compiler support and compiler optimizations targeting PIM architectures; (iv)
operating system support for PIM-aware virtual memory, memory management, data
allocation, and data mapping; and (v) efficient data coherence and consistency
mechanisms. Our goal in this work is to provide tools and system support for

measurement and feedback. In this example, the limit of interest is that of

high order moments strongly deviate from their limit. As the limit is
approached the transition between the two groups of moments is pushed toward
higher and higher moments. Our findings highlight the importance of the
ordering of limits in certain non-equilibrium related calculations.

GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them
from being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several
contributions to improve these models, with the general aim of facilitating
their use to address industrial-level problems involving graph representations.
Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues of
previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on
large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph
degeneracy and stochastic subgraph decoding techniques, respectively. Besides,
we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing the first extensions of
these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial
applications. We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic
graphs. Furthermore, we argue that GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily
complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging linear encoders. Lastly,
we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection on
graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the
last part of this thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted
from the music streaming service Deezer. We put the emphasis on graph-based
music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our methods can
improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to

Further, radiative properties have been assembled into a monotonically

a look-up table has been developed for these properties for different
thermodynamic states of gases and a multi-dimensional linear interpolation
technique for unavailable thermodynamic states of gases. Furthermore, the FSK

superposition, multiplication and hybrid mixing model. The multiplication
mixing model produces most accurate results among the mixture models used here.
The results obtained from FSK has been validated against line by line method

to calculate the wall heat fluxes and the divergence of radiative heat flux for
various test cases in different category of homogeneous isothermal and isobaric

condensates (BEC). The vortex formation is explored by considering that both
coupled species are confined by a pancake-like harmonic trap, slightly modified
elliptically by a time-dependent periodic potential, with the characteristic
frequency enough larger than the transversal trap frequency. The approach is
applied to the experimentally accessible binary mixtures $^{85}$Rb-$^{133}$Cs
and $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb, which allow us to verify the effect of mass
differences in the dynamics. For both species, the time evolutions of the
respective energy contributions, together with associated velocities, are
studied in order to distinguish turbulent from non-turbulent flows. By using
the angular momentum and moment of inertia mean values, effective classical
rotation frequencies are suggested, which are further considered within
simulations in the rotating frame without the stirring potential. Spectral
analysis is also provided for both species, with the main focus being the
incompressible kinetic energies. In the transient turbulent regime, before
stable vortex patterns are produced, the characteristic $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov
behavior is clearly identified for both species at intermediate momenta $k$
above the inverse Thomas-Fermi radial positions, further modified by the
universal $k^{-3}$ scaling at momenta higher than the inverse of the respective
healing lengths.
  Emerging from the mass-imbalanced comparison, relevant is to observe that, as
larger is the mass difference, much faster is the dynamical production of
stable vortices.

sizes but cannot yield an exact crowd count. We resolve this problem by
introducing ""anchors"" during the inference stage. Concretely, anchors are a few
images with count labels used for referencing the corresponding counts from
potential scores by a simple linear mapping function. We conduct extensive

(IRS) beamforming framework to boost the sum computation rate of an IRS-aided
mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where each device follows a binary
offloading policy. Specifically, the task of each device has to be either
executed locally or offloaded to MEC servers as a whole with the aid of given
number of IRS beamforming vectors available. By flexibly controlling the number
of IRS reconfiguration times, the system can achieve a balance between the
performance and associated signalling overhead. We aim to maximize the sum
computation rate by jointly optimizing the computational mode selection for
each device, offloading time allocation, and IRS beamforming vectors across
time. Since the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and NP-hard, there
are generally no standard methods to solve it optimally. To tackle this
problem, we first propose a penalty-based successive convex approximation
algorithm, where all the associated variables in the inner-layer iterations are
optimized simultaneously and the obtained solution is guaranteed to be locally
optimal. Then, we further derive the offloading activation condition for each
device by deeply exploiting the intrinsic structure of the original
optimization problem. According to the offloading activation condition, a
low-complexity algorithm based on the successive refinement method is proposed
to obtain high-quality solutions, which is more appealing for practical systems
with a large number of devices and IRS elements. Moreover, the optimal
condition for the proposed low-complexity algorithm is revealed. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and also

  We analyzed 70 T1-weighted and diffusion MRIs longitudinally collected from

measures of acute intracranial injury estimated from head CT and blood protein
biomarkers.
  Post-injury structural network abnormality was significantly higher than
controls in both subacute and chronic periods, associated with an acute CT
lesion and subacute blood levels of glial fibrillary acid protein (r=0.5,

capabilities close to memory.
  Naively employing PIM to accelerate data-intensive workloads can lead to
sub-optimal performance due to the many design constraints PIM substrates

exp(-(e2+e3)/2kTc)+ exp(-(e3+e1)/2kTc)= 1, where e1, e2, e3 are the
nearest-neighbor interaction energies, and e1+ e2> 0, e2+ e3> 0, e3+ e1> 0.
Finally, we have derived expressions for the thermally induced meandering of
the domain walls at temperatures below the phase transition temperature. We
show how these expressions can be used to extract the interaction energies of

probabilities estimated by a finite number of measurements of quantum states

construct classifiers of random dynamics and show that the classifiers succeed
to characterize random dynamics. We then apply the classifiers to the data set
generated by local random circuits (LRCs), which are canonical quantum circuits
with growing circuit complexity, and show that the classifiers successfully
characterize the growing features. We further apply the classifiers to noisy
LRCs, showing the possibility of using them for verifying noisy quantum

scattering and energy losses. The medium-induced gluon radiation for a massive
quark will be suppressed relative to that of a light quark due to the dead-cone
effect. The development of new declustering techniques of jet evolution makes a
direct study of the dead-cone effect in the QCD medium possible for the first
time. In this work, we compute the emission angle distribution of the
charm-quark initiated splittings in $\rm D^0$ meson tagged jet and that of the
light parton initiated splittings in inclusive jets in p+p and Pb+Pb at
$5.02$~TeV by utilizing the declustering techniques of jet evolution. The heavy
quark propagation and indued energy loss in the QCD medium are simulated with
the SHELL model based on the Langevin equation. When comparing the jet number
normalized emission angle distributions of the charm-quark initiated splittings
and that of the light parton initiated splittings by directly taking their
ratios at the same energy intervals of the initial parton, one can find the
charm-quark initiated splittings will be suppressed at smaller emission angle
corresponding to the dead-cone effect. The dead-cone effect of the jet
quenching can be directly observed. We further investigate the case of the
emission angle distributions normalized to the number of splittings in jets and
find that the dead-cone effect will broaden the emission angle of the splitting
and reduce the possibility of such splitting occurring, leading to the massive
parton losing less energy.

respect to arbitrary high-level control objectives within different operational
scenarios. In contrast to literature, an overall tuning is performed for the
entire GNC system, which is new in the context of autonomous underwater
vehicles. The main challenges in solving the optimization problem are
computationally expensive objective function evaluations, crashing simulations
due to infeasible parametrization and the numerous tunable parameters (in our
case 13). These challenges are met by using constrained Bayesian optimization
with crash constraints. The method is demonstrated in simulation on a GNC
system of an underactuated miniature AUV designed within the TRIPLE-nanoAUV
initiative for exploration of sub-glacial lakes. We quantify the substantial
reduction in energy consumption achieved by tuning the overall system.
Furthermore, different parametrizations are automatically generated for
different power consumption functions, robustness, and accuracy requirements.
E.g. energy consumption can be reduced by ~28%, if the maximum allowed
deviation from the planned path is increased by ~65%. This shows the versatile
practical applicability of the optimization-based tuning approach.

spintronics. These phenomena occur in hybrid systems of normal metals and
magnets. Spin transfer is the conversion of spin currents in metals to a torque
on the magnetization of magnets. Spin pumping is the emission of spin currents
from precessing magnets. Here, we demonstrate a general way to understand these
effects within a quantum out-of-equilibrium path-integral model. Our results
agree with known expressions for spin transfer and spin pumping in terms of
transverse (mixing) conductances when there are no fluctuations. However, at a
finite temperature, frequency or spin accumulation, the magnet also experiences
fluctuating torques. In the classical regime, when the thermal energy is larger
than the bias voltage and precession frequency, we reproduce the classical
Brownian-Langevin forces associated with spin transfer and spin pumping. At low
temperatures, in the quantum regime, we demonstrate that magnetization
fluctuations differ in the elastic and inelastic electron transport regimes.
Furthermore, we show how additional transport coefficients beyond the mixing
conductance govern the fluctuations. Some of these coefficients are related to
electron shot noise because of the discrete spin angular momentum of electrons.
We estimate the fluctuation coefficients of clean, tunnel, and disordered
junctions and in the case of an insulating magnet. Our results open a path for

for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential
equations (PDE) on unstructured polygonal Voronoi meshes. Rather than using
classical polynomials of degree N inside each element, in our new approach the
discrete solution is represented by piecewise continuous polynomials of degree
N within each Voronoi element, using a continuous finite element basis defined
on a subgrid inside each polygon. We call the resulting subgrid basis an
agglomerated finite element (AFE) basis for the DG method on general polygons,
since it is obtained by the agglomeration of the finite element basis functions
associated with the subgrid triangles. The basis functions on each sub-triangle
are defined, as usual, on a universal reference element, hence allowing to
compute universal mass, flux and stiffness matrices for the subgrid triangles
once and for all in a pre-processing stage for the reference element only.
Consequently, the construction of an efficient quadrature-free algorithm is
possible, despite the unstructured nature of the computational grid. High order
of accuracy in time is achieved thanks to the ADER approach, making use of an
element-local space-time Galerkin finite element predictor.
  The novel schemes are carefully validated against a set of typical benchmark
problems for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical
results have been checked with reference solutions available in literature and
also systematically compared, in terms of computational efficiency and
accuracy, with those obtained by the corresponding modal DG version of the
scheme.

  Detection","8 pages, 4 figures, to be published in IJCNN at IEEE WCCI 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a challenging task in realistic
applications. Recently, there is an increasing trend to detect anomalies with
deep neural networks (DNN). However, most popular deep AD detectors cannot
protect the network from learning contaminated information brought by anomalous
data, resulting in unsatisfactory detection performance and overfitting issues.
In this work, we identify one reason that hinders most existing DNN-based
anomaly detection methods from performing is the wide adoption of the Empirical
Risk Minimization (ERM). ERM assumes that the performance of an algorithm on an
unknown distribution can be approximated by averaging losses on the known
training set. This averaging scheme thus ignores the distinctions between
normal and anomalous instances. To break through the limitations of ERM, we
propose a novel Diminishing Empirical Risk Minimization (DERM) framework.
Specifically, DERM adaptively adjusts the impact of individual losses through a
well-devised aggregation strategy. Theoretically, our proposed DERM can
directly modify the gradient contribution of each individual loss in the
optimization process to suppress the influence of outliers, leading to a robust
anomaly detector. Empirically, DERM outperformed the state-of-the-art on the
unsupervised AD benchmark consisting of 18 datasets.

While there exists a rich literature that studies classification and regression

model for a seq2seq task that gives us explicit control over the degree of

two learning regimes corresponding to distinct phases in the stationary state

different time scales that govern the sequence statistics. Moreover, we observe
that while increasing the memory of the AR model always improves performance,
increasing the non-Markovianity of the input sequences can improve or degrade

and intuitively improves the robustness of the system's function. If, in
contrast, it deteriorate operation by overloading other edges, the
counterintuitive phenomenon of \emph{Braess' paradox} emerges. How to predict
which edges enhancements may trigger Braess' paradox remains unknown to date.
To approximately locate and intuitively understand such Braessian edges, we
here present a differential perspective on how enhancing any edge impacts
network-wide flow patterns. First, we exactly map the prediction problem to a
dual problem of electrostatic dipole currents on networks such that
simultaneously finding \textit{all} Braessian edges is equivalent to finding
the currents in the resistor network resulting from a constant current across
one edge. Second, we propose a simple approximate criterion -- rerouting
alignment -- to efficiently predict Braessian edges, thereby providing an
intuitive topological understanding of the phenomenon. Finally, we show how to
intentionally weaken Braessian edges to mitigate network overload, with
beneficial consequences for network functionality.

from three aspects -- the construction of contrastive examples, the choice of
the contrastive loss, and the strategy in decoding. We validate CoNT on five
generation tasks with ten benchmarks, including machine translation,
summarization, code comment generation, data-to-text generation and commonsense
generation. Experimental results show that CoNT clearly outperforms the
conventional training framework on all the ten benchmarks with a convincing
margin. Especially, CoNT surpasses previous the most competitive contrastive
learning method for text generation, by 1.50 BLEU on machine translation and
1.77 ROUGE-1 on summarization, respectively. It achieves new state-of-the-art
on summarization, code comment generation (without external data) and
data-to-text generation.

optimality, we find that the optimal solutions of many safe RL problems are not
robust and safe against carefully designed observational perturbations. We
formally analyze the unique properties of designing effective observational
adversarial attackers in the safe RL setting. We show that baseline adversarial
attack techniques for standard RL tasks are not always effective for safe RL
and propose two new approaches - one maximizes the cost and the other maximizes
the reward. One interesting and counter-intuitive finding is that the maximum
reward attack is strong, as it can both induce unsafe behaviors and make the
attack stealthy by maintaining the reward. We further propose a robust training
framework for safe RL and evaluate it via comprehensive experiments. This paper
provides a pioneer work to investigate the safety and robustness of RL under
observational attacks for future safe RL studies. Code is available at:

we present a parameter-efficient and student-friendly knowledge distillation

appropriate smoothness of the soft label. Then, we introduce an adapter module

to adversarial attacks. One such attack that has garnered recent attention is
the adversarial backdoor attack, which has demonstrated the capability to
perform targeted misclassification of specific examples. In particular,
backdoor attacks attempt to force a model to learn spurious relations between
backdoor trigger patterns and false labels. In response to this threat,
numerous defensive measures have been proposed; however, defenses against
backdoor attacks focus on backdoor pattern detection, which may be unreliable
against novel or unexpected types of backdoor pattern designs. We introduce a
novel re-contextualization of the adversarial setting, where the presence of an
adversary implicitly admits the existence of multiple database contributors.
Then, under the mild assumption of contributor awareness, it becomes possible
to exploit this knowledge to defend against backdoor attacks by destroying the
false label associations. We propose a contributor-aware universal defensive
framework for learning in the presence of multiple, potentially adversarial
data sources that utilizes semi-supervised ensembles and learning from crowds
to filter the false labels produced by adversarial triggers. Importantly, this
defensive strategy is agnostic to backdoor pattern design, as it functions
without needing -- or even attempting -- to perform either adversary
identification or backdoor pattern detection during either training or
inference. Our empirical studies demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
framework against adversarial backdoor attacks from multiple simultaneous
adversaries.

similarities in English and Urdu news articles based on transliteration.

to find the content they are looking for because these most of them contain
irrelevant data and most users did not get what they want to retrieve. Our
proposed framework will help to predict Urdu news in the interests of users and
reduce the users searching time for news. For this purpose, NLP techniques are
used for pre-processing, and then TF-IDF with cosine similarity is used for
gaining the highest similarity and recommended news on user preferences.
Moreover, the BERT language model is also used for similarity, and by using the
BERT model similarity increases as compared to TF-IDF so the approach works
better with the BERT language model and recommends news to the user on their
interest. The news is recommended when the similarity of the articles is above
60 percent.

in today's software industry. Efficient and stealthy debuggers are especially
relevant for malware analysis. However, existing debugging platforms fail to
address a transparent, effective, and high-performance low-level debugger due
to their detectable fingerprints, complexity, and implementation restrictions.
In this paper, we present HyperDbg, a new hypervisor-assisted debugger for
high-performance and stealthy debugging of user and kernel applications. To
accomplish this, HyperDbg relies on state-of-the-art hardware features
available in today's CPUs, such as VT-x and extended page tables. In contrast
to other widely used existing debuggers, we design HyperDbg using a custom
hypervisor, making it independent of OS functionality or API. We propose
hardware-based instruction-level emulation and OS-level API hooking via
extended page tables to increase the stealthiness. Our results of the dynamic
analysis of 10,853 malware samples show that HyperDbg's stealthiness allows
debugging on average 22% and 26% more samples than WinDbg and x64dbg,
respectively. Moreover, in contrast to existing debuggers, HyperDbg is not
detected by any of the 13 tested packers and protectors. We improve the
performance over other debuggers by deploying a VMX-compatible script engine,
eliminating unnecessary context switches. Our experiment on three concrete
debugging scenarios shows that compared to WinDbg as the only kernel debugger,
HyperDbg performs step-in, conditional breaks, and syscall recording, 2.98x,
1319x, and 2018x faster, respectively. We finally show real-world applications,
such as a 0-day analysis, structure reconstruction for reverse engineering,
software performance analysis, and code-coverage analysis.
