academia alike. Deep neural networks can solve some of the most complex
pattern-recognition problems today, but come with the price of massive compute
and memory requirements. This makes the problem of deploying such large-scale
neural networks challenging in resource-constrained mobile edge computing
platforms, specifically in mission-critical domains like surveillance and
healthcare. To solve this, a promising solution is to split resource-hungry
neural networks into lightweight disjoint smaller components for pipelined
distributed processing. At present, there are two main approaches to do this:
semantic and layer-wise splitting. The former partitions a neural network into
parallel disjoint models that produce a part of the result, whereas the latter
partitions into sequential models that produce intermediate results. However,
there is no intelligent algorithm that decides which splitting strategy to use
and places such modular splits to edge nodes for optimal performance. To combat
this, this work proposes a novel AI-driven online policy, SplitPlace, that uses
Multi-Armed-Bandits to intelligently decide between layer and semantic
splitting strategies based on the input task's service deadline demands.
SplitPlace places such neural network split fragments on mobile edge devices
using decision-aware reinforcement learning for efficient and scalable
computing. Moreover, SplitPlace fine-tunes its placement engine to adapt to
volatile environments. Our experiments on physical mobile-edge environments
with real-world workloads show that SplitPlace can significantly improve the
state-of-the-art in terms of average response time, deadline violation rate,
inference accuracy, and total reward by up to 46, 69, 3 and 12 percent
respectively.

low-dimensional latent factors, in many cases what determines a unique

directly related to neural activity, we develop a clustering method based on a

Validating our proposed MCMC algorithm through simulations, we find that it can
accurately recover the unknown parameters and the true clustering in the model,

that the proposed method can identify novel, reliable clusters of neurons based

${km}^2$ Aleppo pine forest growing at the semi-arid timberline (with no
irrigation or fertilization). The organic carbon sequestration rate (above and
below ground) was measured as 550 gram $CO_2 {m}^{-2} {yr}^{-1}$, by Eddy
Covariance flux and Carbon Stock counting methods. Assuming that the soil
composition at Yatir is representative, we estimate a global organic
sequestration rate of roughly 3.0 billion tons $CO_2$ per year, after future
global forestation, by extrapolating to 20% of the global semi-arid area.
Consider now the inorganic carbon sequestration rate. $CO_2$ exhaled into the
soil by tree roots is hydrated by soil water to produce mainly bicarbonate
${{HCO}_3}^-$, which combines with soil ${Ca}^{2+}$ to precipitate calcite
${CaCO}_3$. We quantify the annual sequestration rate in Yatir soil cores by
measuring the decreased density versus depth, of bicarbonates in the liquid
phase of the soil unsaturated zone (USZ). We found that the bicarbonate
concentration decreases with depth, as the calcite precipitates and is
incorporated within the USZ. The depth profiles were converted to time
profiles, taking into account the $\approx 11 cm/yr$ annual rate of downward
water percolation at Yatir. In 1 Liter of sediment, using data from a core
depth of 2.2 meters, the calcite precipitation rate was measured as 22 mg $CO_2

respiration, extrapolating as above, roughly 0.8 billion tons of $CO_2$ could
potentially be sequestered globally each year. The total organic plus inorganic
sequestration rate is then $\approx 4$ billion tons $CO_2$ per year. This
demonstrates the global potential, the need for further measurements, and the
need to begin implementing a global land management policy of widespread tree
planting in semi-arid regions.

viewers' attention is focused, reducing exploratory behavior and enabling the
optimization of network resources; in addition, it allows for a precise

evaluate several approaches to network uncertainty in the far-OOD and near-OOD

ability to store relational knowledge applicable to many areas. Despite great
efforts invested in creation and maintenance, even the largest KGs are far from
complete. Hence, KG completion (KGC) has become one of the most crucial tasks
for KG research. Recently, considerable literature in this space has centered
around the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn powerful embeddings
which leverage topological structures in the KGs. Specifically, dedicated
efforts have been made to extend GNNs, which are commonly designed for simple
homogeneous and uni-relational graphs, to the KG context which has diverse and
multi-relational connections between entities, by designing more complex
aggregation schemes over neighboring nodes (crucial to GNN performance) to
appropriately leverage multi-relational information. The success of these
methods is naturally attributed to the use of GNNs over simpler multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) models, owing to their additional aggregation functionality.
In this work, we find that surprisingly, simple MLP models are able to achieve
comparable performance to GNNs, suggesting that aggregation may not be as
crucial as previously believed. With further exploration, we show careful
scoring function and loss function design has a much stronger influence on KGC
model performance, and aggregation is not practically required. This suggests a
conflation of scoring function design, loss function design, and aggregation in
prior work, with promising insights regarding the scalability of
state-of-the-art KGC methods today, as well as careful attention to more
suitable aggregation designs for KGC tasks tomorrow. The implementation is

Visual Object Tracking (VOT) challenge over the past few years. However, with
great accuracy comes great computational complexity: to achieve real-time
processing, these trackers have to be massively parallelised and are usually
run on high-end GPUs. Easy to implement, this approach is energy consuming, and
thus cannot be used in many low-power applications. To overcome this, one can
use energy-efficient embedded devices, such as heterogeneous platforms joining
the ARM processor system with programmable logic (FPGA). In this work, we
propose a hardware-software implementation of the well-known fully connected
Siamese tracker (SiamFC). We have developed a quantised Siamese network for the
FINN accelerator, using algorithm-accelerator co-design, and performed design
space exploration to achieve the best efficiency-to-energy ratio (determined by
FPS and used resources). For our network, running in the programmable logic
part of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104, we achieved the processing of almost
50 frames-per-second with tracker accuracy on par with its floating point
counterpart, as well as the original SiamFC network. The complete tracking
system, implemented in ARM with the network accelerated on FPGA, achieves up to
17 fps. These results bring us towards bridging the gap between the highly
accurate but energy-demanding algorithms and energy-efficient solutions ready
to be used in low-power, edge systems.

allows us to extract the high dimensional topology information in the mask for

  Dimensional Covariates","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.05245",,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Gaussian graphical regression is a powerful means that regresses the
precision matrix of a Gaussian graphical model on covariates, permitting the
numbers of the response variables and covariates to far exceed the sample size.
Model fitting is typically carried out via separate node-wise lasso
regressions, ignoring the network-induced structure among these regressions.
Consequently, the error rate is high, especially when the number of nodes is
large. We propose a multi-task learning estimator for fitting Gaussian
graphical regression models; we design a cross-task group sparsity penalty and
a within task element-wise sparsity penalty, which govern the sparsity of
active covariates and their effects on the graph, respectively. For
computation, we consider an efficient augmented Lagrangian algorithm, which
solves subproblems with a semi-smooth Newton method. For theory, we show that
the error rate of the multi-task learning based estimates has much improvement
over that of the separate node-wise lasso estimates, because the cross-task
penalty borrows information across tasks. To address the main challenge that
the tasks are entangled in a complicated correlation structure, we establish a
new tail probability bound for correlated heavy-tailed (sub-exponential)
variables with an arbitrary correlation structure, a useful theoretical result
in its own right. Finally, the utility of our method is demonstrated through
simulations as well as an application to a gene co-expression network study
with brain cancer patients.

  Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG,

mechanics of dynamic boundary conditions proposed by Fischer, Maass, &
Dieterich [1], Goldstein, Miranville, & Schimperna [2], and Knopf, Lam, Liu &
Metzger, [3]. As a byproduct, we generalize these theories. These types of
dynamic boundary conditions are described by the coupling between the bulk and
surface partial differential equations for phase fields. Our point of departure
within this continuum framework is the principle of virtual powers postulated
on an arbitrary part $\mathcal{P}$ where the boundary $\partial\mathcal{P}$ may
lose smoothness. That is, the normal field may be discontinuous along an edge
$\partial^2\mathcal{P}$. However, the edges characterizing the discontinuity of
the normal field are considered smooth. Our results may be summarized as
follows. We provide a generalized version of the principle of virtual powers
for the bulk-surface coupling along with a generalized version of the partwise
free-energy imbalance. Next, we derive the explicit form of the surface and
edge microtractions along with the field equations for the bulk and surface
phase fields. The final set of field equations somewhat resembles the
Cahn--Hilliard equation for both the bulk and surface. Lastly, we provide a
suitable set of constitutive relations and thermodynamically consistent
boundary conditions.

accomplish this, we prove some general theoretical results pertaining to

is a form of gradient tree boosting with an adaptive learning rate, which makes
it fast and trivial to implement with off-the-shelf software. Finally, we show

the brain reward system. We propose a simple and easily interpretable dynamical
systems model to describe the neurobiology of drug addiction that incorporates
the psychiatric concepts of reward prediction error (RPE), drug-induced
incentive salience (IST), and opponent process theory (OPT). Drug-induced
dopamine releases activate a biphasic reward response with pleasurable,
positive ""a-processes"" (euphoria, rush) followed by unpleasant, negative
""b-processes"" (cravings, withdrawal). Neuroadaptive processes triggered by
successive intakes enhance the negative component of the reward response, which
the user compensates for by increasing drug dose and/or intake frequency. This
positive feedback between physiological changes and drug self-administration
leads to habituation, tolerance and eventually to full addiction. Our model
gives rise to qualitatively different pathways to addiction that can represent
a diverse set of user profiles (genetics, age) and drug potencies. We find that
users who have, or neuroadaptively develop, a strong b-process response to drug
consumption are most at risk for addiction. Finally, we include possible
mechanisms to mitigate withdrawal symptoms, such as through the use of
methadone or other auxiliary drugs used in detoxification.

meaning of the $E^{\infty}$-terms of its associated spectral sequence: Let
$L^{\ast}$ and $L_{\ast}$ denote the limit and colimit abutting objects of the
exact couple, filtered by the kernel and image objects to the associated cone
and cocone diagrams. Then the unstable E-infinite extension theorem states how
adjacent filtration quotients of the colimit filtration are extended by
$E^{\infty}$ objects over corresponding adjacent filtration quotients of the
kernel filtration.
  The stable E-infinity extension theorem is based on the fact that the
derivation process of the exact couple admits a transfinite recursion which is
beyond the scope of the traditional spectral sequence perspective. The
transfinite recursion always stabilizes at some ordinal. The resulting stable
$E$-objects are (a) always subobjects of $E^{\infty}$ and (b) extend adjacent
filtration quotients of the colimit filtration over corresponding adjacent
filtration quotients of the kernel filtration {\em without} the need for lim-1
corrective terms.
  The E-infinity extension theorems enable conclusions about the filtered
limit/colimit abutments even in cases where the spectral sequence is far from
converging in any traditional sense. We develop such results in the context of
'comparing' the spectral sequences via the morphism that is induced by a
morphism of underlying exact couples.
  We also contribute to 'reverse comparison' in a spectral sequence; that is
using information about the universal abutment(s) of the underlying exact
couple to extract information about one or more pages of the spectral sequence.
These results overlap with Zeeman's comparison theorems in a generalizing
fashion.

attack effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Phrase-Level Textual
Adversarial aTtack (PLAT) that generates adversarial samples through

attack targets by a syntactic parser, and then perturbs them by a pre-trained
blank-infilling model. Such flexible perturbation design substantially expands
the search space for more effective attacks without introducing too many
modifications, and meanwhile maintaining the textual fluency and grammaticality
via contextualized generation using surrounding texts. Moreover, we develop a
label-preservation filter leveraging the likelihoods of language models
fine-tuned on each class, rather than textual similarity, to rule out those
perturbations that potentially alter the original class label for humans.
Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate that PLAT has a superior
attack effectiveness as well as a better label consistency than strong

to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. However, the
SFDA setting faces an effect bottleneck due to the absence of source data and
target supervised information, as evidenced by the limited performance gains of
newest SFDA methods. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a more
practical scenario called active source free domain adaptation (ASFDA) that
permits actively selecting a few target data to be labeled by experts. To
achieve that, we first find that those satisfying the properties of
neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and target-like are the best points to
select, and we define them as the minimum happy (MH) points. We then propose
minimum happy points learning (MHPL) to actively explore and exploit MH points.
We design three unique strategies: neighbor ambient uncertainty, neighbor
diversity relaxation, and one-shot querying, to explore the MH points. Further,
to fully exploit MH points in the learning process, we design a neighbor focal
loss that assigns the weighted neighbor purity to the cross-entropy loss of MH
points to make the model focus more on them. Extensive experiments verify that
MHPL remarkably exceeds the various types of baselines and achieves significant
performance gains at a small cost of labeling.

that is currently of avid interest in the industry. However, little research
work has been done to synthesize knowledge related to design systems in order
to inform the design of tools to support their creation, maintenance, and usage
practices. This paper represents an important step in which we explored the
issues that design system projects usually deal with and the perceptions and
values of design system project leaders. Through this exploration, we aim to
investigate the needs for tools that support the design system approach. We
found that the open source communities around design systems focused on
discussing issues related to behaviors of user interface components of design
systems. At the same time, leaders of design system projects faced considerable
challenges when evolving their design systems to make them both capable of
capturing stable design knowledge and flexible to the needs of the various
concrete products. They valued a bottom-up approach for design system creation
and maintenance, in which components are elevated and merged from the evolving
products. Our findings synthesize the knowledge and lay foundations for
designing techniques and tools aimed at supporting the design system practice
and related modern user interaction design and development approaches.

parent node prediction to determine a node in the existing proof that a new

dearth of compact objects with mass $\sim 2.5-5~{\rm M_\odot}$. This so-called
""mass gap"" may be linked to the supernova explosion mechanisms that produce
neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). However, the existence of a few
mass-gap compact objects, some of which have been confirmed to be BHs, poses a
challenge to the traditional theory of black hole formation. In this work we
investigate the possible formation channel of BHs from accretion-induced
collapse (AIC) of NSs in X-ray binaries. In particular, we consider the
influence of super-Eddington accretion of NSs. Recent observations of
ultraluminous X-ray pulsars suggest that their apparent luminosities may
reflect the true accretion luminosities of the accreting NSs, even exceeding
the Eddington limit by a factor of $\gtrsim 100$. Thus, NSs accreting at a
super-Eddington accretion rate may rapidly grow into BHs in
intermediate/low-mass X-ray binaries. Based on the super-Eddington accretion
disk models, we have investigated the evolution of NSs in intermediate/low-mass
X-ray binaries by combining binary population synthesis and detailed stellar
evolutionary calculations. We show that super-Eddington accretion plays a
critical role in mass growth of NSs, and the final masses of the descendant BHs
are heavily dependent on the NS magnetic fields, the metallicity of the donor
star, and the bifurcation period of the binaries. AIC of NSs may account for
some of the observed mass-gap BHs like GRO J0422+32. We also present the
parameter distributions of the potential mass-gap BHs in a Milky Way-like
galaxy, and point out that future space-based gravitational wave observations
may provide important test of or constraints on the formation of mass-gap BHs
from the AIC channel.

crucial information for galaxy evolution and cosmology studies. In this work,
we propose a new Machine Learning (ML) tool called Galaxy morphoto-Z with
neural Networks (GaZNet-1), which uses both images and multi-band photometry
measurements to predict galaxy redshifts, with accuracy, precision and outlier
fraction superior to standard methods based on photometry only. As a first
application of this tool, we estimate photo-z of a sample of galaxies in the
Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). GaZNet-1 is trained and tested on $\sim140 000$
galaxies collected from KiDS Data Release 4 (DR4), for which spectroscopic
redshifts are available from different surveys. This sample is dominated by
bright (MAG$\_$AUTO$<21$) and low redshift ($z < 0.8$) systems, however, we
could use $\sim$ 6500 galaxies in the range $0.8 < z < 3$ to effectively extend
the training to higher redshift. The inputs are the r-band galaxy images plus
the 9-band magnitudes and colours, from the combined catalogs of optical
photometry from KiDS and near-infrared photometry from the VISTA Kilo-degree
Infrared survey. By combining the images and catalogs, GaZNet-1 can achieve
extremely high precision in normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD=0.014
for lower redshift and NMAD=0.041 for higher redshift galaxies) and low
fraction of outliers ($0.4$\% for lower and $1.27$\% for higher redshift
galaxies). Compared to ML codes using only photometry as input, GaZNet-1 also
shows a $\sim 10-35$% improvement in precision at different redshifts and a
$\sim$ 45% reduction in the fraction of outliers. We finally discuss that, by
correctly separating galaxies from stars and active galactic nuclei, the
overall photo-z outlier fraction of galaxies can be cut down to $0.3$\%.

neurons extend two types of processes: axons and dendrites, which navigate to
other neurons and form complex neuronal networks that transmit electrical
signals throughout the body. The basic process underlying the network formation
is axonal growth, a process involving the extension of axons from the cell body
towards target neurons. During growth axons sense their environment, process
information, and respond to external stimuli by adapting their growth dynamics.
Environmental stimuli include intercellular interactions, biochemical cues, and
the mechanical and geometrical features of the growth substrate. Axonal
dynamics is controlled both by deterministic components (tendency to grow in
certain preferred directions imparted by surface properties), and a random
deviation from these growth directions due to stochastic processes. Despite
recent impressive advances in our understanding of how neurons grow and form
functional connections, a fully quantitative description of axonal dynamics is
still missing. In this paper, we present a review of our work on stochastic
models. We show that Langevin and Fokker-Planck stochastic differential
equations provide a powerful theoretical framework for describing how
collective axonal dynamics and the formation of neuronal network emerge from
biophysics of single neurons and their interactions. We combine this
theoretical analysis with experimental data to extract key parameters of axonal
growth: diffusion coefficients, speed and angular distributions, mean square
displacements, and mechanical parameters describing the cell-substrate
coupling. These results have important implications for our understanding of
the fundamental mechanisms involved in the formation of functional neuronal
networks, as well as for bioengineering novel scaffolds to promote nerve
regeneration.

used in addressing \textit{why} deep models make such predictions. Beyond that,
the current research community becomes more interested in reasoning
\textit{how} deep models make predictions, where some prototype-based methods
employ interpretable representations with their corresponding visual cues to
reveal the black-box mechanism of deep model behaviors. However, these
pioneering attempts only either learn the category-specific prototypes and
deteriorate their generalizing capacities, or demonstrate several illustrative
examples without a quantitative evaluation of visual-based interpretability

the concept of visual words and propose the Learnable Visual Words (LVW) to

visual words learning and dual fidelity preservation. The semantic visual words
learning relaxes the category-specific constraint, enabling the general visual
words shared across different categories. Beyond employing the visual words for
prediction to align visual words with the base model, our dual fidelity
preservation also includes the attention guided semantic alignment that
encourages the learned visual words to focus on the same conceptual regions for
prediction. Experiments on six visual benchmarks demonstrate the superior

far, which precludes the atomistic understanding of the properties of polarons

succeeded to create single polarons in a monolayer two-dimensional

polaron configurations, centered at on-top and hollow sites, respectively, have
been revealed. Remarkably, a series of manipulation progresses, from creation,
erasure to transition, can be accurately implemented on individual polarons.
Our results pave the way to understand the polaronic physics at atomic level,

adopted in model training because it yields faster convergence than

orderings can further speed up convergence empirically, at the cost of using
more computation and memory. However, greedy ordering lacks theoretical
justification and has limited utility due to its non-trivial memory and
computation overhead. In this paper, we first formulate an example-ordering
framework named herding and answer affirmatively that SGD with herding
converges at the rate $O(T^{-2/3})$ on smooth, non-convex objectives, faster
than the $O(n^{1/3}T^{-2/3})$ obtained by random reshuffling, where $n$ denotes
the number of data points and $T$ denotes the total number of iterations. To
reduce the memory overhead, we leverage discrepancy minimization theory to
propose an online Gradient Balancing algorithm (GraB) that enjoys the same rate

computation from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, where $d$ denotes the model dimension. We

for two types of bifurcations, Hopf bifurcation and Heteroclinic bifurcation,
both of which result in stable limit cycles. These limit cycles have not been
identified in existing works, and we further prove that such limit cycles are
in fact persistent in a large parameter space and are almost globally stable.

However, its computation time varies with each run. We numerically calculate
the probability distributions of Brownian adders' computation time, given by
the first-passage time, and analyze the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and
the thermodynamic cost based on stochastic thermodynamics. The computation can
be completed in finite time without environment entropy production, i.e.,
without wasting heat to the environment. The thermodynamics cost is paid
through error-free output detection and the resets of computation cycles. The
signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the computation time's predictability, and it
is well estimated by the mixed bound, which is approximated by the square root
of the number of token detections. The thermodynamic cost tends to play a minor
role in token-based Brownian circuits in computation cycles. This contrasts
with the logically reversible Brownian Turing machine, in which the entropy
production increases logarithmically with the size of the state space, and thus
worsens the mixed bound.

zero-power communication, is expected to be a pivotal paradigm for the next
generation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the ""strong"" direct link
(DL) interference (DLI) is traditionally assumed to be harmful, and generally
drowns out the ""weak"" backscattered signals accordingly, thus deteriorating the
performance of BackCom. In contrast to the previous efforts to eliminate the
DLI, in this paper, we exploit the constructive interference (CI), in which the
DLI contributes to the backscattered signal. To be specific, our objective is
to maximize the received signal power by jointly optimizing the receive
beamforming vectors and tag selection factors, which is, however, non-convex
and difficult to solve due to constraints on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence. In order to solve this problem, we first decompose the original
problem, and then propose two algorithms to solve the sub-problem with
beamforming design via a change of variables and semi-definite programming
(SDP) and a greedy algorithm to solve the sub-problem with tag selection. In
order to gain insight into the CI, we consider a special case with the
single-antenna reader to reveal the channel angle between the backscattering
link (BL) and the DL, in which the DLI will become constructive. Simulation
results show that significant performance gain can always be achieved in the
proposed algorithms compared with the traditional algorithms without the DL in
terms of the strength of the received signal. The derived constructive channel
angle for the BackCom system with the single-antenna reader is also confirmed

gap on equal footing, we examine the HF-BCS-type approximation in which the

latter is incorporated in priority. We find that, when the pairing gap and the
band gap are comparable as in the inner crust of neutron stars, they need to be
treated on equal footing, and the HF-BCS approximation can considerably
underestimate the superfluid density even if the pairing gap is much smaller
than the Fermi energy. Our result suggests that the validity of the HF-BCS

questionable.

attention due to its strong fitting ability and data-driven learning
capability. Compared with the typical DL feedforward network structures, an
enhancement structure with direct data feedback have been studied and proved to
have better performance than the feedfoward networks. However, due to the above
simple feedback methods lack sufficient analysis and learning ability on the
feedback data, it is inadequate to deal with more complicated nonlinear systems
and therefore the performance is limited for further improvement. In this
paper, a novel multi-agent feedback enabled neural network (MAFENN) framework
is proposed, which make the framework have stronger feedback learning
capabilities and more intelligence on feature abstraction, denoising or
generation, etc. Furthermore, the MAFENN framework is theoretically formulated
into a three-player Feedback Stackelberg game, and the game is proved to
converge to the Feedback Stackelberg equilibrium. The design of MAFENN
framework and algorithm are dedicated to enhance the learning capability of the
feedfoward DL networks or their variations with the simple data feedback. To
verify the MAFENN framework's feasibility in wireless communications, a
multi-agent MAFENN based equalizer (MAFENN-E) is developed for wireless fading
channels with inter-symbol interference (ISI). Experimental results show that
when the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme is adopted, the
SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of the traditional
equalizers by about 2 dB in linear channels. When in nonlinear channels, the
SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of either traditional
or DL based equalizers more significantly, which shows the effectiveness and
robustness of our proposal in the complex channel environment.

formation of spatiotemporal patterns in many scientific and engineering fields,

a mixed-type modal discontinuous Galerkin approach is developed for one- and
two- dimensional NCRD systems, including linear, Gray-Scott, Brusselator,
isothermal chemical, and Schnakenberg models to yield the spatiotemporal
patterns. These models essentially represent a variety of complicated natural
spatiotemporal patterns such as spots, spot replication, stripes, hexagons, and
so on. In this approach, a mixed-type formulation is presented to address the
second-order derivatives emerging in the diffusion terms. For spatial
discretization, hierarchical modal basis functions premised on the orthogonal
scaled Legendre polynomials are used. Moreover, a novel reaction term treatment
is proposed for the NCRD systems, demonstrating an intrinsic feature of the new
DG scheme and preventing erroneous solutions due to extremely nonlinear
reaction terms. The proposed approach reduces the NCRD systems into a framework
of ordinary differential equations in time, which are addressed by an explicit
third-order TVD Runge-Kutta algorithm. The spatiotemporal patterns generated
with the present approach are very comparable to those found in the literature.
This approach can readily be expanded to handle large multi-dimensional
problems that come up as model equations in developed biological and chemical
applications.

relevant contextual sentences during inference along with the input, we observe
large improvements in reducing the gender bias in translations, across three

for many decades to alleviate this computational burden. Recently, data-driven
techniques have also shown promise for these problems. Motivated by the
conjugate gradients algorithm that iteratively selects search directions for
minimizing the matrix norm of the approximation error, we design an approach
that utilizes a deep neural network to accelerate convergence via data-driven
improvement of the search directions. Our method leverages a carefully chosen

deep neural networks and the increasing demand for intelligent video analysis,
MOT has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision
community. Embedding methods play an essential role in object location
estimation and temporal identity association in MOT. Unlike other computer
vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection,
re-identification, and segmentation, embedding methods in MOT have large
variations, and they have never been systematically analyzed and summarized. In
this survey, we first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis
for embedding methods in MOT from seven different perspectives, including
patch-level embedding, single-frame embedding, cross-frame joint embedding,
correlation embedding, sequential embedding, tracklet embedding, and
cross-track relational embedding. We further summarize the existing widely used
MOT datasets and analyze the advantages of existing state-of-the-art methods
according to their embedding strategies. Finally, some critical yet
under-investigated areas and future research directions are discussed.

which requires the pertinent model to automatically predict a precise alpha
matte for each human instance. Straightforward combination of closely related
techniques, namely, instance segmentation, soft segmentation and
human/conventional matting, will easily fail in complex cases requiring
disentangling mingled colors belonging to multiple instances along hairy and
thin boundary structures. To tackle these technical challenges, we propose a
human instance matting framework, called InstMatt, where a novel mutual
guidance strategy working in tandem with a multi-instance refinement module is
used, for delineating multi-instance relationship among humans with complex and
overlapping boundaries if present. A new instance matting metric called
instance matting quality (IMQ) is proposed, which addresses the absence of a
unified and fair means of evaluation emphasizing both instance recognition and
matting quality. Finally, we construct a HIM benchmark for evaluation, which
comprises of both synthetic and natural benchmark images. In addition to
thorough experimental results on complex cases with multiple and overlapping
human instances each has intricate boundaries, preliminary results are
presented on general instance matting. Code and benchmark are available in

technologies will be a cornerstone of future wireless 6G systems. Intent-based
communication requires the network to consider the semantics (meanings) and
effectiveness (at end-user) of the data transmission. This is essential if 6G
systems are to communicate reliably with fewer bits while simultaneously
providing connectivity to heterogeneous users. In this paper, contrary to state
of the art, which lacks explainability of data, the framework of neuro-symbolic
artificial intelligence (NeSy AI) is proposed as a pillar for learning causal
structure behind the observed data. In particular, the emerging concept of
generative flow networks (GFlowNet) is leveraged for the first time in a
wireless system to learn the probabilistic structure which generates the data.
Further, a novel optimization problem for learning the optimal encoding and
decoding functions is rigorously formulated with the intent of achieving higher
semantic reliability. Novel analytical formulations are developed to define key
metrics for semantic message transmission, including semantic distortion,
semantic similarity, and semantic reliability. These semantic measure functions
rely on the proposed definition of semantic content of the knowledge base and
this information measure is reflective of the nodes' reasoning capabilities.
Simulation results validate the ability to communicate efficiently (with less
bits but same semantics) and significantly better compared to a conventional
system which does not exploit the reasoning capabilities.

modules. The goal of ranking modules (aka rankers) is to elaborately
discriminate users' preference on item candidates proposed by recall modules.
With the success of deep learning techniques in various domains, we have
witnessed the mainstream rankers evolve from traditional models to deep neural
models. However, the way that we design and use rankers remains unchanged:
offline training the model, freezing the parameters, and deploying it for
online serving. Actually, the candidate items are determined by specific user
requests, in which underlying distributions (e.g., the proportion of items for
different categories, the proportion of popular or new items) are highly
different from one another in a production environment. The classical
parameter-frozen inference manner cannot adapt to dynamic serving
circumstances, making rankers' performance compromised. In this paper, we
propose a new training and inference paradigm, termed as Ada-Ranker, to address
the challenges of dynamic online serving. Instead of using parameter-frozen
models for universal serving, Ada-Ranker can adaptively modulate parameters of
a ranker according to the data distribution of the current group of item
candidates. We first extract distribution patterns from the item candidates.
Then, we modulate the ranker by the patterns to make the ranker adapt to the
current data distribution. Finally, we use the revised ranker to score the
candidate list. In this way, we empower the ranker with the capacity of
adapting from a global model to a local model which better handles the current
task.

and more serious musculoskeletal issues. However, in-clinic sleep assessments
are often limited to vital signs (e.g. brain waves). Wearable sensors with
embedded inertial measurement units have been used for sleep posture
classification; nonetheless, previous works consider only few (commonly four)
postures, which are inadequate for advanced clinical assessments. Moreover,
posture learning algorithms typically require longitudinal data collection to
function reliably, and often operate on raw inertial sensor readings unfamiliar
to clinicians. This paper proposes a new framework for sleep posture
classification based on a minimal set of joint angle measurements. The proposed
framework is validated on a rich set of twelve postures in two experimental
pipelines: computer animation to obtain synthetic postural data, and human
participant pilot study using custom-made miniature wearable sensors. Through
fusing raw geo-inertial sensor measurements to compute a filtered estimate of
relative segment orientations across the wrist and ankle joints, the body
posture can be characterised in a way comprehensible to medical experts. The
proposed sleep posture learning framework offers plug-and-play posture
classification by capitalising on a novel kinematic data augmentation method
that requires only one training example per posture. Additionally, a new metric
together with data visualisations are employed to extract meaningful insights
from the postures dataset, demonstrate the added value of the data augmentation
method, and explain the classification performance. The proposed framework
attained promising overall accuracy as high as 100% on synthetic data and 92.7%
on real data, on par with state of the art data-hungry algorithms available in
the literature.

desirable car-following controller should keep a reasonable range of distances

numerous control methods have been proposed: some only rely on local sensing;
others also make use of non-local downstream observations. While local methods
are capable of attenuating high-frequency velocity oscillation and are
economical to compute, non-local methods can dampen a wider spectrum of
oscillatory traffic but incur a larger cost in computing. In this article, we
design a novel non-local tri-layer MPC controller that is capable of smoothing
a wide range of oscillatory traffic and is amenable to real-time applications.
At the core of the controller design are 1) an accessible prediction method
based on ETA estimation and 2) a robust, light-weight optimization procedure,
designed specifically for handling various headway constraints. Numerical
simulations suggest that the proposed controller can simultaneously maintain a
variable headway while driving with modest acceleration and is robust to
imperfect traffic predictions.

performance in various challenging tasks, they can easily encounter
catastrophic forgetting or interference when faced with lifelong streaming
information. In the paper, we propose a scalable lifelong RL method that
dynamically expands the network capacity to accommodate new knowledge while
preventing past memories from being perturbed. We use a Dirichlet process
mixture to model the non-stationary task distribution, which captures task
relatedness by estimating the likelihood of task-to-cluster assignments and
clusters the task models in a latent space. We formulate the prior distribution
of the mixture as a Chinese restaurant process (CRP) that instantiates new
mixture components as needed. The update and expansion of the mixture are
governed by the Bayesian non-parametric framework with an expectation
maximization (EM) procedure, which dynamically adapts the model complexity
without explicit task boundaries or heuristics. Moreover, we use the domain
randomization technique to train robust prior parameters for the initialization
of each task model in the mixture, thus the resulting model can better
generalize and adapt to unseen tasks. With extensive experiments conducted on
robot navigation and locomotion domains, we show that our method successfully
facilitates scalable lifelong RL and outperforms relevant existing methods.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most existing state-of-the-art video classification methods assume that the
training data obey a uniform distribution. However, video data in the real
world typically exhibit an imbalanced long-tailed class distribution, resulting
in a model bias towards head class and relatively low performance on tail
class. While the current long-tailed classification methods usually focus on
image classification, adapting it to video data is not a trivial extension. We
propose an end-to-end multi-expert distribution calibration method to address
these challenges based on two-level distribution information. The method
jointly considers the distribution of samples in each class (intra-class
distribution) and the overall distribution of diverse data (inter-class
distribution) to solve the issue of imbalanced data under long-tailed
distribution. By modeling the two-level distribution information, the model can
jointly consider the head classes and the tail classes and significantly
transfer the knowledge from the head classes to improve the performance of the
tail classes. Extensive experiments verify that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the long-tailed video classification task.

overcomes the unfavorable impact of deep fading channels. Distinguishingly, we
endow conventional RISs with spectrum learning capabilities by leveraging a
fully-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model at each RIS controller,
thereby helping the base station to cooperatively infer the users who request
to participate in FL at the beginning of each training iteration. To fully
exploit the potential of FL and RISs, we address three technical challenges:
RISs phase shifts configuration, user-RIS association, and wireless bandwidth
allocation. The resulting joint learning, wireless resource allocation, and
user-RIS association design is formulated as an optimization problem whose
objective is to maximize the system utility while considering the impact of FL
prediction accuracy. In this context, the accuracy of FL prediction interplays
with the performance of resource optimization. In particular, if the accuracy
of the trained CNN model deteriorates, the performance of resource allocation
worsens. The proposed FSL framework is tested by using real radio frequency
(RF) traces and numerical results demonstrate its advantages in terms of
spectrum prediction accuracy and system utility: a better CNN prediction
accuracy and FL system utility can be achieved with a larger number of RISs and
reflecting elements.

standard values, which do not take into account effects associated with CDM
clustering. We check that our conclusions are hardly affected by numerical
artefacts. We estimate the merger rate of binary PBHs due to emission of
gravitational wave at the present time both in the standard case when the
effects associated with clustering are neglected and in the case when they are
taken into account and show, that these effects could increase the merger rate
at least by $6-8$ times in comparison to the standard estimate. This, in turn,
means, that a mass fraction of PBHs, $f$, should be smaller than it was assumed
before.

surroundings and are often organised in larger events termed showers. Thermal
instability (TI) within a coronal loop in a state of thermal non-equilibrium
(TNE) is the leading mechanism behind the formation of coronal rain but no
investigation on showers exists to date. In this study, we conduct a
morphological and thermodynamic multi-wavelength study of coronal rain showers
observed in an active region (AR) off-limb with IRIS and SDO, spanning
chromospheric to transition region and coronal temperatures. Rain showers were
found to be widespread across the AR over the 5.45-hour observing time, with
average length, width and duration of 27.37$\pm$11.95 Mm, 2.14$\pm$0.74 Mm, and
35.22$\pm$20.35 min, respectively. We find a good correspondence between
showers and the cooling coronal structures consistent with the TNE-TI scenario,
thereby properly identifying coronal loops in the 'coronal veil', including the
strong expansion at low heights and an almost zero expansion in the corona.
This agrees with previous work suggesting that the observed zero expansion in
the EUV is due to specific cross-field temperature distribution. We estimate
the total number of showers to be 155$\pm$40, leading to a TNE volume of
4.56$\pm$3.71 $\times$ $10^{28}$cm$^{3}$, i.e. on the same order of the AR

however, the real quantum manifestation of glass and the relationship between
classical and quantum glass are totally unknown and remain to be observed in
real systems. Here, we report the direct observation of classical-to-quantum
evolution in the frustration-induced charge glass state exhibited by
interacting electrons in organic materials. We employ Raman spectroscopy to
capture a snapshot of the charge density distribution of each molecule in a
series of charge glasses formed on triangular lattices with different
geometrical frustrations. In less frustrated glass, the charge density profile
exhibits a particle-like two-valued distribution; however, it becomes
continuous and narrowed with increasing frustration, demonstrating the
classical-to-quantum crossover. Moreover, the charge density distribution shows
contrasting temperature evolution in classical and quantum glasses, enabling us
to delineate energy landscapes with distinct features. The present result is
the first to experimentally identify the quantum charge glass and show how it
emerges from classical glass.

$\frac{1}{n}S$ converges to a Mar$\check{\text{c}}$enko-Pastur law. Several
extensions of this result are also known. We prove a general result on the
existence of the LSD of $S$ in probability or almost surely, and in particular,
many of the above results follow as special cases. At the same time several new
LSD results also follow from our general result.
  The moments of the LSD are quite involved but can be described via a set of
partitions. Unlike in the i.i.d. entries case, these partitions are not
necessarily non-crossing, but are related to the special symmetric partitions
which are known to appear in the LSD of (generalised) Wigner matrices with
independent entries.
  We also investigate the existence of the LSD of $S_{A}=AA^T$ when $A$ is the
$p\times n$ symmetric or the asymmetric version of any of the following four
random matrices: reverse circulant, circulant, Toeplitz and Hankel. The LSD of
$\frac{1}{n}S_{A}$ for the above four cases have been studied by Bose,
Gangopadhyay and Sen in 2010, when the entries are i.i.d. We show that under
some general assumptions on the entries of $A$, the LSD of $S_{A}$ exists and
this result generalises the existing results significantly.

demonstrations of expert behavior. It is common to frame imitation learning as
a supervised learning problem in which one fits a function approximator to the
input-output mapping exhibited by the logged demonstrations (input observations
to output actions). While the framing of imitation learning as a supervised
input-output learning problem allows for applicability in a wide variety of
settings, it is also an overly simplistic view of the problem in situations
where the expert demonstrations provide much richer insight into expert
behavior. For example, applications such as path navigation, robot
manipulation, and strategy games acquire expert demonstrations via planning,
search, or some other multi-step algorithm, revealing not just the output
action to be imitated but also the procedure for how to determine this action.
While these intermediate computations may use tools not available to the agent
during inference (e.g., environment simulators), they are nevertheless
informative as a way to explain an expert's mapping of state to actions. To
properly leverage expert procedure information without relying on the
privileged tools the expert may have used to perform the procedure, we propose
procedure cloning, which applies supervised sequence prediction to imitate the
series of expert computations. This way, procedure cloning learns not only what
to do (i.e., the output action), but how and why to do it (i.e., the
procedure). Through empirical analysis on navigation, simulated robotic
manipulation, and game-playing environments, we show that imitating the
intermediate computations of an expert's behavior enables procedure cloning to
learn policies exhibiting significant generalization to unseen environment
configurations, including those configurations for which running the expert's
procedure directly is infeasible.

realized just by sputtering and chemical immersion processes, resulting in high
productivity. We found a significant enhancement on the order of 10$^7$-fold
for Raman scattering and 10$^2$-fold for fluorescence by RPE even without the
proximity of metal nanostructures and analyte molecules. We confirmed the
feasibility of RPE for biophotonic analysis. RPE worked for dye molecules in
cells cultured on the CSS layer, enabling the enhanced fluorescence biosensing
of intracellular signaling dynamics in HeLa cells. RPE also worked for
biological tissues, enhancing Raman histological imaging of esophagus tissues
with esophageal adventitia of a Wistar rat attached atop the CSS layer. We also
investigated the wavelength dependency of RPE on the on- or off-resonant with
the dye molecular transition dipoles with various molecular concentrations. The
results suggested that the RPE occurred by remote resonant coupling between the
localized surface plasmon of AgNIs and the molecular transition dipole of the

redox probe in a variety of processes ranging from solution chemistry,
medicinal chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, surface chemistry to solid-state
molecular electronic and spintronic circuit elements to unravel electrochemical
charge-transfer dynamics. Ferrocene represents an extremely chemically and
thermally stable, and highly reproducible redox probe that undergoes reversible
one-electron oxidation and reduction occurring at the interfaces of
electrode/ferrocene solution in response to applied anodic and cathodic
potentials, respectively. It has been almost 70 years after its discovery and
has become one of the most widely studied and model organometallic compounds
not only for probing electrochemical charge-transfer process but also as
molecular building blocks for the synthesis of chiral organometallic catalysts,
potential drug candidates, polymeric compounds, electrochemical sensors, to
name a few. Ferrocene and its derivatives have been a breakthrough in many
aspects due to its versatile reactivity, fascinating chemical structures,
unconventional metal-ligand coordination, and the magic number of electrons (18
e-). The present review discusses the recent progress made towards
ferrocene-containing molecular systems exploited for redox reactions, surface
attachment, spin-dependent electrochemical process to probe spin polarization,
photo-electrochemistry, and integration into prototype molecular electronic
devices. Overall, the present reviews demonstrate a piece of collective

bio-artificial capsules in microscopy imaging is a prerequisite to the
computer-aided understanding of important biomechanical phenomenons.
State-of-the-art segmentation performances are achieved by deep neural networks
and related data-driven approaches. Training these networks from only a few
annotated examples is challenging while producing manually annotated images
that provide supervision is tedious.
  Method: Recently, self-supervision, i.e. designing a neural pipeline
providing synthetic or indirect supervision, has proved to significantly
increase generalization performances of models trained on few shots. The
objective of this paper is to introduce one such neural pipeline in the context
of micro-capsule image segmentation. Our method leverages the rather simple
content of these images so that a trainee network can be mentored by a referee
network which has been previously trained on synthetically generated pairs of
corrupted/correct region masks.
  Results: Challenging experimental setups are investigated. They involve from
only 3 to 10 annotated images along with moderately large amounts of
unannotated images. In a bio-artificial capsule dataset, our approach
consistently and drastically improves accuracy. We also show that the learnt
referee network is transferable to another Glioblastoma cell dataset and that
it can be efficiently coupled with data augmentation strategies.
  Conclusions: Experimental results show that very significant accuracy
increments are obtained by the proposed pipeline, leading to the conclusion
that the self-supervision mechanism introduced in this paper has the potential
to replace human annotations.

predictions by updating their features to increase their likelihood of
receiving a particular (positive) decision (at a certain cost). Yet, when
different demographic groups have different feature distributions or different
cost functions, prior work has shown that individuals from minority groups
often pay a higher cost to update their features. Fair classification aims to
address such classifier performance disparities by constraining the classifiers
to satisfy statistical fairness properties. However, we show that standard
fairness constraints do not guarantee that the constrained classifier reduces
the disparity in strategic manipulation cost. To address such biases in
strategic settings and provide equal opportunities for strategic manipulation,
we propose a constrained optimization framework that constructs classifiers
that lower the strategic manipulation cost for the minority groups. We develop
our framework by studying theoretical connections between group-specific
strategic cost disparity and standard selection rate fairness metrics (e.g.,
statistical rate and true positive rate). Empirically, we show the efficacy of
this approach over multiple real-world datasets.

privacy-preserving machine learning framework. However, classical FL faces
serious security and robustness problem, e.g., malicious clients can poison
model updates and at the same time claim large quantities to amplify the impact
of their model updates in the model aggregation. Existing defense methods for
FL, while all handling malicious model updates, either treat all quantities
benign or simply ignore/truncate the quantities of all clients. The former is
vulnerable to quantity-enhanced attack, while the latter leads to sub-optimal
performance since the local data on different clients is usually in
significantly different sizes. In this paper, we propose a robust
quantity-aware aggregation algorithm for federated learning, called FedRA, to
perform the aggregation with awareness of local data quantities while being
able to defend against quantity-enhanced attacks. More specifically, we propose
a method to filter malicious clients by jointly considering the uploaded model
updates and data quantities from different clients, and performing
quantity-aware weighted averaging on model updates from remaining clients.
Moreover, as the number of malicious clients participating in the federated
learning may dynamically change in different rounds, we also propose a
malicious client number estimator to predict how many suspicious clients should
be filtered in each round. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our FedRA method in defending FL against quantity-enhanced
attacks.

a detection dataset with a total of 10,000 images and a tracking dataset with

existing detection algorithms and evaluate the algorithms' performance. Several

stars is limited. We aim to increase the sample and precisely measure the
masses and eccentricities of giant planets and BDs transiting AF-type stars
detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We followed
bright (V < 12 mag) stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ > 6200 K that host giant
companions (R > 7 $\mathrm{R_{\rm \oplus}}$) using ground-based photometric
observations as well as high precision RV measurements from the CORALIE,
CHIRON, TRES, FEROS, and MINERVA-Australis spectrographs. In the context, we
present the discovery of three BD companions, TOI-629b, TOI-1982b, and
TOI-2543b, and one massive planet, TOI-1107b. From the joint analysis we find
the BDs have masses between 66 and 68 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$, periods between
7.54 and 17.17 days, and radii between 0.95 and 1.11 $\mathrm{R_{\rm Jup}}$.
The hot Jupiter TOI-1107b has an orbital period of 4.08 days, a radius of 1.30
$\mathrm{R_{\rm Jup}}$, and a mass of 3.35 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$. As a
by-product of this program, we identified four low-mass eclipsing components

The rise of machine learning-based partial differential equation solvers can
meet this need. These solvers can be classified into two categories:
approximating the solution function (Physics-informed neural network) and
learning the solution operator (Neural operator). The recently proposed

it is considered that the most part of the present universe is filled with a
form of energy that exerts a negative pressure called dark energy, which drives
the acceleration. In the present work, we assume a dynamical dark energy model,
where dark energy interacts with matter and grows at the expense of the latter.
Using this model, we discuss the evolution of the universe within the context
of loop quantum cosmology. Our work successfully explains the presently
observed accelerated expansion of the universe, by predicting that the present
universe is phantom dominated. We also found that in the past, the expansion of
the universe was decelerated one and transition from deceleration to
acceleration would occur at $t_{q=0}=0.688t_0$, where $t_0$ is the present age
of the universe. Again, our analysis predicted that at the transition time, the
universe would be dominated with quintessence type dark energy.

to uniform hypergraphs. For an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H,$ we derive an order
$r+1$ trace formula of the (signless) Laplacian tensor of $H.$ Among others by
using this trace formula, we obtain lower bounds for the signless Laplacian
Estrada index and upper bounds for the Laplacian Estrada index. Moreover, we
establish a bound involving both the Laplacian Estrada index and Laplacian
energy of a uniform hypergraph.

parallelization to write a fast map reduce algorithm to count word frequencies
across large numbers of documents. We first implement the word frequency
counter algorithm on a CPU using two processes with MPI. Then, we create
another implementation, but on a GPU using the Julia CUDA library, though not
using the in built map reduce algorithm within FoldsCUDA.jl. After doing this,
we apply our CPU and GPU algorithms to count the frequencies of words in
speeches given by Presidents George W Bush, Barack H Obama, Donald J Trump, and
Joseph R Biden with the aim of finding patterns in word choice that could be
used to uniquely identify each President. We find that each President does have
certain words that they use distinctly more often than their fellow Presidents,
and these words are not surprising given the political climate at the time.
  The goal of this project was to create faster MapReduce algorithms in Julia
on the CPU and GPU than the ones that have already been written previously. We
present some simple cases of mapping functions where our GPU algorithm
outperforms Julia's FoldsCUDA implementation. We also discuss ideas for further
optimizations in the case of counting word frequencies in documents and for
these specific mapping functions.

interactions. However, as the complexity of the systems increase, we argue that
novel modeling approaches are needed that can deal with inter-dependencies at
different levels of society, where many heterogeneous parties (software agents,
robots, humans) are interacting and reacting to each other. In this paper, we
present a formalization of a social framework for agents based on the concept
of Social Practices as high level specifications of normal (expected) behavior
in a given social context. We argue that social practices facilitate the
practical reasoning of agents in standard social interactions. Thus they can
support deliberations for complex situations just like conventions and norms.
However, they also come with a social context that gives handles for social
planning and deliberation in top of the normal functional deliberation. The
main goal of this paper is to give a formalization of social practices that can
be used as a basis for implementations and defining precise structures within
which social learning can take place.

communications (URLLC) is still a question for beyond 5G wireless networks. Low
latency access to the channel and efficiently sharing spectrum among the
multiple users are the main requirements for exploiting unlicensed spectrum for
URLLC. Listen before talk and back-off procedures implemented to avoid the
collisions in channel access hinder the low latency communication. In this
paper, we propose a novel low-latency medium access control (MAC) scheme based
on the collision resolution for a pairwise random wireless network. We use
geometric sequence decomposition for collision resolution among the competing
users. This enables the system to tackle collisions and thus removing the need
for carrier sensing and back-off procedures. This saves time in obtaining
access to the channel and improves the efficiency of the system. We implement
our approach in the synchronized time slotted system and show that it yields
significant improvement over existing MAC schemes.

in modern wireless communication systems. While traditional Belief Propagation
(BP) detectors perform poorly on loopy graphs, the recent Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs)-based method can overcome the drawbacks of BP and achieve superior
performance. Nevertheless, direct use of GNN ignores the importance of edge
attributes and suffers from high computation overhead using a fully connected
graph structure. In this paper, we propose an efficient GNN-inspired algorithm,
called the Edge Graph Neural Network (EGNN), to detect MIMO signals. We first
compute graph edge weights through channel correlation and then leverage the
obtained weights as a metric to evaluate the importance of neighbors of each
node. Moreover, we design an adaptive Edge Drop (ED) scheme to sparsify the
graph such that computational cost can be significantly reduced. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed EGNN achieves better or comparable
performance to popular MIMO detection methods for different modulation schemes
and costs the least detection time compared to GNN-based approaches.
