substantial computational complexity, particularly in circumstances involving
varied boundary conditions between the solid and fluid phases. Examples of such
interactions include melting, sublimation, and deflagration, all of which
exhibit bidirectional coupling, mass/heat transfer, and topological change of
the solid-fluid interface. The diffuse interface method is a powerful technique
that has been used to describe a wide range of solid-phase interface-driven
phenomena. The implicit treatment of the interface eliminates the need for
cumbersome interface tracking, and advances in adaptive mesh refinement have
provided a way to sufficiently resolve diffuse interfaces without excessive
computational cost. However, the general scale-invariant coupling of these
techniques to flow solvers has been relatively unexplored. In this work, a
robust method is presented for treating diffuse solid-fluid interfaces with
arbitrary boundary conditions. Source terms defined over the diffuse region
mimic boundary conditions at the solid-fluid interface, and it is demonstrated
that the diffuse length scale has no adverse effects. To show the efficacy of
the method, a one-dimensional implementation is introduced and tested for three
types of boundaries: mass flux through the boundary, a moving boundary, and
passive interaction of the boundary with an incident acoustic wave. These
demonstrate expected behavior in all cases. Convergence analysis is also
performed and compared against the sharp-interface solution, and linear
convergence is observed. This method lays the groundwork for the extension to
viscous flow, and the solution of problems involving time-varying mass-flux
boundaries.

fatalities designed to address the complexity of the drivers and processes of
armed conflicts. The design of this approach is based on two main choices.
First, to account for the specificity of conflict drivers and processes over
time and space, we model conflicts in each individual country separately.
Second, we draw on an adaptive model -- Dynamic Elastic Net, DynENet -- which
is able to efficiently select relevant predictors among a large set of
covariates. We include over 700 variables in our models, adding event data on
top of the data features provided by the con-venors of the forecasting
competition. We show that our approach is suitable and computa-tionally
efficient enough to address the complexity of conflict dynamics. Moreover, the
adaptive nature of our model brings a significant added value. Because for each
country our model only selects the variables that are relevant to predict
conflict intensity, the retained predictors can be analyzed to describe the
dynamic configuration of conflict drivers both across countries and within
countries over time. Countries can then be clustered to observe the emergence
of broader patterns related to correlates of conflict. In this sense, our
ap-proach produces interpretable forecasts, addressing one key limitation of
contemporary ap-proaches to forecasting.

may result in undesirably large generalization error in the absence of other
customized training strategies. Recently, a line of research under the name of
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown that minimizing a sharpness
measure, which reflects the geometry of the loss landscape, can significantly
reduce the generalization error. However, SAM-like methods incur a two-fold
computational overhead of the given base optimizer (e.g. SGD) for approximating
the sharpness measure. In this paper, we propose Sharpness-Aware Training for
Free, or SAF, which mitigates the sharp landscape at almost zero additional
computational cost over the base optimizer. Intuitively, SAF achieves this by
avoiding sudden drops in the loss in the sharp local minima throughout the
trajectory of the updates of the weights. Specifically, we suggest a novel
trajectory loss, based on the KL-divergence between the outputs of DNNs with
the current weights and past weights, as a replacement of the SAM's sharpness
measure. This loss captures the rate of change of the training loss along the
model's update trajectory. By minimizing it, SAF ensures the convergence to a
flat minimum with improved generalization capabilities. Extensive empirical
results show that SAF minimizes the sharpness in the same way that SAM does,
yielding better results on the ImageNet dataset with essentially the same
computational cost as the base optimizer.

black-box functions with an expensive evaluation cost. Such functions emerge in
applications as diverse as hyperparameter tuning, drug discovery, and robotics.
BO hinges on a Bayesian surrogate model to sequentially select query points so
as to balance exploration with exploitation of the search space. Most existing
works rely on a single Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate model, where the
kernel function form is typically preselected using domain knowledge. To bypass
such a design process, this paper leverages an ensemble (E) of GPs to
adaptively select the surrogate model fit on-the-fly, yielding a GP mixture
posterior with enhanced expressiveness for the sought function. Acquisition of
the next evaluation input using this EGP-based function posterior is then
enabled by Thompson sampling (TS) that requires no additional design

proxy for the importance or influence of that node, and the differences in node
centrality generate hierarchies and inequalities. If the network is evolving in
time, the influence of each node changes in time as well, and the corresponding
hierarchies are modified accordingly. However, there is still a lack of
systematic study into the ways in which the centrality of a node evolves when a
graph changes. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of metrics of equality and
hierarchical mobility in networks that evolve in time. We propose an indicator
of equality based on the classical Gini Coefficient from economics, and we
quantify the hierarchical mobility of nodes, that is, how and to what extent
the centrality of a node and its neighbourhood change over time. These measures
are applied to a corpus of thirty time evolving network data sets from
different domains. We show that the proposed taxonomy measures can discriminate
between networks from different fields. We also investigate correlations
between different taxonomy measures, and demonstrate that some of them have
consistently strong correlations (or anti-correlations) across the entire
corpus. The mobility and equality measures developed here constitute a useful
toolbox for investigating the nature of network evolution, and also for
discriminating between different artificial models hypothesised to explain that
evolution.

particular, if one wants to provide a combined explanation of several beyond
the SM effects, like Lepton Flavor Universality (LFU) Violation, as indicated
by the B anomalies, then a strong alignment of the NP operators in flavor space
is required to satisfy the bounds from observables featuring Lepton Flavor
Violation (LFV), like $\mu \to e \gamma$. We derived the tight bound of
$10^{-5}$ on the flavor angle in the dipole operator in the charged-lepton mass

high-scale could spoil the alignment at low-scale, through the Renormalization
Group Evolution (RGE) of the SMEFT. In particular, it imposes constraints on
some 4-fermions operators. We explored dynamical mechanisms as well as flavor
symmetries to explain this flavor alignment, and illustrated the difficulty to
reach it in an explicit NP model. If the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly is confirmed, the

approximated by a Gaussian function, with the parallel fluctuations less so:
kurtoses of the latter are generally larger than 10, and their PDFs indicate
increasing skewness with decreasing distance \(r\) from the Sun, with the

model as an extension of the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. In the
past decade, research on highly scalable algorithms has had significant impact
on many massive systems. The MPC model, introduced in 2010 by Karloff et al.
[16], which is an abstraction of famous practical frameworks such as MapReduce,
Hadoop, Flume, and Spark, has been at the forefront of this research. While
great strides have been taken to create highly efficient MPC algorithms for a
range of problems, recent progress has been limited by the 1-vs-2 Cycle
Conjecture [20], which postulates that the simple problem of distinguishing
between one and two cycles requires $\Omega(\log n)$ MPC rounds. In the AMPC
model, each machine has adaptive read access to a distributed hash table even
when communication is restricted (i.e., in the middle of a round). While
remaining practical [4], this gives algorithms the power to bypass limitations
like the 1-vs-2 Cycle Conjecture.
  We give the first sublogarithmic AMPC algorithm, requiring $O(\log\log n)$
rounds, for $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate weighted Min Cut. Our algorithm is
inspired by the divide and conquer approach of Ghaffari and Nowicki [11], which
solves the $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate weighted Min Cut problem in $O(\log
n\log\log n)$ rounds of MPC using the classic result of Karger and Stein [15].
Our work is fully-scalable in the sense that the local memory of each machine
is $O(n^\epsilon)$ for any constant $0 < \epsilon < 1$. There are no $o(\log
n)$-round MPC algorithms for Min Cut in this memory regime assuming the 1-vs-2
Cycle Conjecture holds. The exponential speedup in AMPC is the result of
decoupling the different layers of the divide and conquer algorithm and solving
all layers in $O(1)$ rounds.

high amounts of between subject variability. Techniques that overcome this will
not only provide richer neuroscientific insights but also make it possible for
group-level models to outperform subject-specific models. Here, we propose a
method that uses subject embedding, analogous to word embedding in Natural
Language Processing, to learn and exploit the structure in between-subject
variability as part of a decoding model, our adaptation of the WaveNet
architecture for classification. We apply this to magnetoencephalography data,
where 15 subjects viewed 118 different images, with 30 examples per image; to
classify images using the entire 1s window following image presentation. We
show that the combination of deep learning and subject embedding is crucial to
closing the performance gap between subject- and group-level decoding models.
Importantly, group models outperform subject models on low-accuracy subjects
(although slightly impair high-accuracy subjects) and can be helpful for
initialising subject models. While we have not generally found group-level
models to perform better than subject-level models, the performance of group
modelling is expected to be even higher with bigger datasets. In order to

objective for local and global clustering over spaces of discrete probability
measures, using Wasserstein distance coupled with Soft-DTW divergence. For
multi-level hierarchies, we present a bottom-up procedure that progressively
leverages lower-level information for higher-level clustering. Our final goal
is to improve both the accuracy and speed of forecasts for a larger number of

is first assigned the forecast for its cluster representative, which can be
considered as a ""shrinkage prior"" for the set of time series it represents.

many challenging scenarios, opportunistic networking techniques are required to
enable communication as devices suffer from intermittent connectivity,
disconnections and partitions. This poses novel challenges to service
composition techniques. While several works have discussed middleware and
architectures for service composition in well-connected wired networks and in
stable MANET environments, the underlying mechanism for selecting and
forwarding service requests in the significantly challenging networking
environment of opportunistic networks has not been entirely addressed. The
problem comprises three stages: i) selecting an appropriate service sequence
set out of available services to obtain the required application level service;
ii) routing results of a previous stage in the composition to the next one
through a multi-hop opportunistic path; and iii) routing final service outcomes
back to the requester. The proposed algorithm derives efficiency and
effectiveness by taking into account the estimated load at service providers
and expected time to opportunistically route information between devices. Based
on this information the algorithm estimates the best composition to obtain a
required service. It is shown that using only local knowledge collected in a

representations and with outstanding performance on various tasks such as node
classification. However, noise, which inevitably exists in real-world graph
data, would considerably degrade the performance of GNNs as the noise is easily
propagated via the graph structure. In this work, we propose a novel and robust
method, Bayesian Robust Graph Contrastive Learning (BRGCL), which trains a GNN
encoder to learn robust node representations. The BRGCL encoder is a completely
unsupervised encoder. Two steps are iteratively executed at each epoch of
training the BRGCL encoder: (1) estimating confident nodes and computing robust
cluster prototypes of node representations through a novel Bayesian
nonparametric method; (2) prototypical contrastive learning between the node
representations and the robust cluster prototypes. Experiments on public and
large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of BRGCL and the
robustness of the learned node representations. The code of BRGCL is available

networks. Instead of relying only on fixed infrastructures as the cloud, users'
devices act as service providers for each other. They use pairwise contacts to
collect information about services provided and amount of time to provide them
by the encountered nodes. At each node, upon generation of a service request,
this information is used to choose the most efficient service, or composition
of services, that satisfy that request, based on local knowledge. Opportunistic
computing can be exploited in several scenarios, including mobile social
networks, IoT and Internet 4.0. In this paper we propose an opportunistic
computing algorithm based on an analytical model, which ranks the available
(composition of) services, based on their expected completion time. Through the
model, a service requesters picks the one that is expected to be the best.
Experiments show that the algorithm is accurate in ranking services, thus
providing an effective service-selection policy. Such a policy achieves
significantly lower service provisioning times compared to other reference
policies. Its performance is tested in a wide range of scenarios varying the
nodes mobility, the size of input/output parameters, the level of resource
congestion, the computational complexity of service executions.

reliance on large amounts of annotated training data that can be costly to
obtain, both anticipation of and training data from the type of environmental
conditions expected at inference time, and/or imagery captured from a previous
visit to the location. In this research, we remove these restrictions by
improving road segmentation based on similar places. We use Visual Place

segmentations for query images and these similar place priors using a Bayesian

to re-evaluate notions of VPR utility for this task. We demonstrate the system
achieving state-of-the-art road segmentation performance across multiple
challenging condition scenarios including night time and snow, without
requiring any prior training or previous access to the same geographical

pellets and the interstellar medium is proposed. The pellets are slower than
the spacecraft and are accelerated backwards as they are overtaken, imparting a
forward acceleration on the spacecraft. This maneuver is possible due to the
interaction with a fixed medium (interstellar medium, ISM); as the spacecraft
travels through the medium, it is able to extract power from the relative wind.
This concept relies upon the relative velocities (shear) between the pellet
stream and the fixed medium in order to concentrate the energy of the pellets
into the spacecraft and is thus termed wind-pellet shear sailing. The equations
governing the mass ratio of pellets to the spacecraft and its dependence on the
final spacecraft velocity are derived; the critical role of the efficiency of
the power extraction and transfer process is identified. Natural sources of
energy are considered as a means to accelerate the pellets to velocities of
1000 to 6000 km/s. Techniques for onboard generation of power via
electromagnetic interaction with the ISM are reviewed, with a repetitively
stroked plasma magnet being identified as a promising approach. The necessity
of the spacecraft to detect and track the pellets as they are overtaken
dictates the desired properties of the pellets. Pellet pushers (accelerators)
on board the spacecraft are also preliminarily explored in their engineering

limitation by learning a non-linear shape function for each feature separately,
followed by a linear model on top. However, these models are typically
difficult to train, require numerous parameters, and are difficult to scale. We
propose an entirely new subfamily of GAMs that utilizes basis decomposition of
shape functions. A small number of basis functions are shared among all
features, and are learned jointly for a given task, thus making our model scale
much better to large-scale data with high-dimensional features, especially when
features are sparse. We propose an architecture denoted as the Neural Basis

modeling and input physics of both the progenitor and the WD stars, thus
avoiding and improving several shortcomings present in the set of DA WD models
employed in the asteroseismological analyses of ZZ Ceti stars we carried out in

with the changes in the internal chemical distribution that result from the
mixing of all the core chemical components induced by mean molecular-weight
inversions, from $^{22}$Ne diffusion, Coulomb sedimentation, and from residual
nuclearburning. In addition, the expected nuclear-burning history and mixing
events along the progenitor evolution are accounted for, in particular the
occurrence of third dredge-up, which determines the properties of the core and
envelope of post-AGB and white dwarf stars, as well as the WD initial-final
mass relation. The range of H envelopes of our new ZZ star models extends from
log(M_H/M_*)= -4 to -5, to log(M_H/M_*)= -13.5. This allows, for the first
time, to consider seismological solutions for ZZ Ceti stars with extremely thin
H envelopes. Our new H-burning post-AGB models predict chemical profiles of O

optimization problems subject to nonlinear PDE constraints based on the
occupation measure formalism. The main appeal of these methods is the fact that
they rely on convex optimization, typically semidefinite programming. In this
work we close an open question related to this approach. We prove that the
classical and relaxed minima coincide when the dimension of the codomain of the
unknown function equals one, both for calculus of variations and for optimal
control problems, thereby complementing analogous results that existed for the
case when the dimension of the domain equals one. In order to do so, we prove a
generalization of the Hardt-Pitts decomposition of normal currents applicable
in our setting. We also show by means of a counterexample that, if both the
dimensions of the domain and of the codomain are greater than one, there may be
a positive gap. The example we construct to show the latter serves also to show
that sometimes relaxed occupation measures may represent a more
conceptually-satisfactory ""solution"" than their classical counterparts, so that
-- even though they may not be equivalent -- algorithms rendering accessible
the minimum in the larger space of relaxed occupation measures remain extremely
valuable. Finally, we show that in the presence of integral constraints, a
positive gap may occur at any dimension of the domain and of the codomain.

performance of these pre-training approaches can be significantly improved by a
simple post-processing in the form of feature distillation (FD). The feature
distillation converts the old representations to new representations that have
a few desirable properties just like those representations produced by MIM.
These properties, which we aggregately refer to as optimization friendliness,
are identified and analyzed by a set of attention- and optimization-related
diagnosis tools. With these properties, the new representations show strong
fine-tuning performance. Specifically, the contrastive self-supervised learning
methods are made as competitive in fine-tuning as the state-of-the-art masked
image modeling (MIM) algorithms. The CLIP models' fine-tuning performance is
also significantly improved, with a CLIP ViT-L model reaching 89.0% top-1

first global models of collapsars that start from a stellar progenitor and
self-consistently describe the evolution of the disk, its composition, and its
outflows in response to the imploding stellar mantle, using energy-dependent M1
neutrino transport and an alpha-viscosity to approximate turbulent
angular-momentum transport. We find that a neutron-rich, neutrino-dominated
accretion flow (NDAF) is established only marginally--either for short times or
relatively low viscosities--because the disk tends to disintegrate into an
advective disk (ADAF) already at relatively high mass-accretion rates,
launching powerful outflows but preventing it from developing a hot, dense, and
therefore neutron-rich core. Viscous outflows disrupt the star within ~100s
with explosion energies close to that of hypernovae. If viscosity is neglected,
a stable NDAF with disk mass of about 1Msun is formed but is unable to release
neutron-rich ejecta, while it produces a relatively mild explosion powered by a
neutrino-driven wind blown off its surface. With ejecta electron fractions
close to 0.5, all models presumably produce large amounts of Ni56. Our results
suggest that collapsar models based on the alpha-viscosity are inefficient
r-process sites and that genuinely magnetohydrodynamic effects may be required
to generate neutron-rich outflows. A relatively weak effective viscosity
generated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence would improve the prospects for
obtaining neutron-rich ejecta.

Focusing on the role of the (uncertain) magnetic field strength, we study the
resulting electromagnetic signatures as a function of the external dipolar and
internal toroidal fields. These two parameters govern, respectively, the
competition between magnetic-dipole spindown and gravitational-wave spindown
(due to magnetic-field deformation) of the rapidly-rotating remnant. We find
that even in the parameter space where gravitational-wave emission is dominant,
a kilonova with a magnetar central engine will be significantly brighter than
one without an engine, as this parameter space is where more of the spin-down
luminosity is thermalised. In contrast, a system with minimal
gravitational-wave emission will produce a kilonova that may be difficult to
distinguish from ordinary kilonovae unless early-epoch observations are
available. However, as the bulk of the energy in this parameter space goes into
accelerating the ejecta, such a system will produce a brighter kilonova
afterglow that will peak on shorter times. To effectively hide the presence of
the magnetar from the kilonova and kilonova afterglow, the rotational energy
inputted into the ejecta must be $\lesssim 10^{-3}-10^{-2} E_{\rm rot}$. We
discuss the different diagnostics available to identify magnetar-driven

stellar structures, including a new class of extended stellar filaments called
stellar ""strings"", first proposed by Kounkel and Covey 2019. We explore the
spatial, kinematic, and chemical composition of strings to demonstrate that
these newfound structures are largely inconsistent with being physical objects
whose members share a common origin. Examining the 3D spatial distribution of
string members, we find that the spatial dispersion around the claimed string
spine does not improve in the latest Gaia DR3 data release -- despite tangible
gains in the signal-to-noise of the parallax measurements -- counter to
expectations of a bona fide structure. Using the radial velocity dispersion of
the strings (averaging $\rm\sigma_{V_r} = 16\;km\;s^{-1}$) to estimate their
virial masses, we find that all strings are gravitationally unbound. Given the
finding that the strings are dispersing, the reported stellar ages of the
strings are typically $120\times$ larger than their measured dispersal times.
Finally, we validate prior work that stellar strings are more chemically
homogeneous than their local field stars, but show it is possible to obtain the
same signatures of chemical homogeneity by drawing random samples of stars from
spatially, temporally, and kinematically unrelated open clusters. Our results
show that while some strings may be composed of real sub-structures, there is
no consistent evidence for larger string-like connections over the sample.
These results underline the need for caution in over-interpreting the
significance of these strings and their role in understanding the star
formation history of the Milky Way.

a unique opportunity for studying both types of outflows in the same system. We
used contemporaneous X-ray (Chandra Observatory) and optical (Gran Telescopio

We show that the kinetic properties of the wind, as derived from P-Cyg profiles
detected in the optical range at low hard X-ray fluxes and in a number of X-ray
transitions during luminous flares, are remarkably similar. Furthermore,
strictly simultaneous data taken at intermediate hard X-ray fluxes show
consistent emission line properties between the optical and the X-ray emission

several scenarios to explain the properties of the wind, favouring the presence
of a dynamic, multi-phase outflow during the entire outburst of the system.
This study, together with the growing number of wind detections with fairly
similar characteristic velocities at different wavelengths, suggest that
wind-type X-ray binary outflows might be predominantly multi-phase in nature.

imaging (HCI) dictates the achievable contrast of the instrument. In conditions
where the coherence time of the atmosphere is short compared to the speed of
the AO system, the servo-lag error can become the dominant error term of the AO
system. While the AO system measures the wavefront error and subsequently
applies a correction (typically taking a total of one or a few milliseconds),
the atmospheric turbulence above the telescope has changed resulting in the
servo-lag error. In addition to reducing the Strehl ratio, the servo-lag error
causes a build-up of speckles along the direction of the dominant wind vector
in the coronagraphic image, severely limiting the contrast at small angular
separations. One strategy to mitigate this problem is to predict the evolution
of the turbulence over the delay time. Our predictive wavefront control
algorithm minimizes, in a mean square sense, the wavefront error over the delay
and has been implemented on the Keck II AO bench. In this paper, we report on
the latest results of our algorithm and discuss updates to the algorithm
itself. We explore how to tune various filter parameters based on both daytime

effective temperature and an enhancement of the extinction caused by newly
produced circumstellar dust. However, the lack of multi-wavelength monitoring
observations, especially in the mid infrared where emission from circumstellar
dust can be detected, has prevented us from closely examining these hypotheses.
Here we present 4.5-year, 16-band photometry of Betelgeuse between 2017-2021 in
the 0.45-13.5 micron wavelength range making use of images taken by the

the Great Dimming. Moreover, using the mid-infrared light curves, we find that
the enhanced circumstellar extinction actually contributed to the Dimming.
Thus, the Dimming event of Betelgeuse provides us an opportunity to examine the
mechanism responsible for the mass loss of red supergiants, which affects the

are expected to decline as they exhaust their gas supply, resulting in a
turn-over in the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and a potential solution to
the missing satellites problem in the local group. Unfortunately, there are
several challenges to constraining `reionization feedback' empirically, most
notably that galaxies in low-mass halos are intrinsically faint, and that there
are other physical mechanisms capable of inducing a turn-over in the LF. In
this work, we investigate a new signature of reionization feedback that is in
principle distinct from other processes: as faint galaxies are quenched by
reionization, their stellar populations passively age and grow redder while the
brighter galaxies nearby continue to form stars at an increasing rate and so
remain relatively blue. We find that this contrast, between quenched and
un-quenched galaxies induces a scale and colour-dependent signature in the
present-day near-infrared background comparable to the expected sensitivity of
NASA's upcoming SPHEREx mission. Whereas models with pure mass suppression
largely affect the signal at wavelengths $\lesssim 2 \mu\rm{m}$, $\sim
5$%-level differences in the background persist out to $\sim 5 \mu\rm{m}$ for
reionization feedback models. Finally, the power spectra of intensity ratio

scenarios that account for possible backreaction phenomena. In particular, we
find that if one considers the increase of the central object mass due to the
partial absorption of the energy carried by the perturbation, the echo signal
can be quite different and non-periodic. Apart from this simple scenario, we
also consider the case in which, in order to preserve its compactness above the

conditioning the reconstructed image to its decoded image category using a
class-conditional generative adversarial network and neural style transfer. The

reconstructed images and can be used as a general framework for enhanced image
reconstruction.

physics of their emitting region and places demands on the observer if a

X-ray and optical observation by Swift provides the best insight into the
variable nature of these objects. This program uses \textit{Swift} data for 19
X-ray-bright blazars, generally at $z > 0.1$, to determine their variability
properties. The analysis is based on structure functions and provides insight
into the nature of the variability and how it depends on time, luminosity, and
redshift. We also consider strategies for observing blazars at or above average
brightness, given a time delay between planning an observation and obtaining
the data. This is critical to observations with orbiting X-ray telescopes,
current or future. The variability in the soft X-ray band is typically three to
eight times larger than at UV-optical wavelengths, at fixed time differences
(i.e., 30 or 100 days). There is almost no difference in the amplitude of
variation (X-ray or UV-optical) as a function of redshift (time delay of 30
days) and a modest positive correlation with luminosity. In the X-ray band,
blazars that become brighter than normal typically remain bright for at least
2-3 months, although with significant flickering. One can avoid observing
objects that are significantly below the average X-ray flux by scheduling the
observation when the $F_X > 0.9 F_{X,avg}$, which requires monitoring
observations near the time of the scheduling activity.

how to derive the Lagrangian of the $SO(2)$ invariant theory admitting a given

non-zero size source not only regularizes the infinite energy of the point
charge but also satisfies the condition of regularity, that the electric field
is zero at the origin. The latter condition was identified earlier as necessary
and sufficient for the NED solution to generate a regular black hole via
so-called double copy construction and is also satisfied by solitons. We
propose a large class of solitonic NED solutions that give rise to regular
black holes via double copy construction and contain solutions of Maxwell and
Born-Infeld as different limits. This class of NED solutions acquires two new
properties in the limit where the corresponding regular black hole's
asymptotics becomes Minkowski: it gives rise to regular higher-spin black holes
via generalization of double copy -- ``higher-copy'' construction, and for very
short distances changes the sign of the force becoming repulsive/attractive for

Using one of two contrastive learning objectives, we can learn both the

challenges. One is that isolated data in most industries are restricted share

anomaly detection is aligning private anomalies from local data owners on the
public anomalies from the attributed network in the server through public
anomalies to federate local anomalies. In each private attributed network, the
detected anomaly subgraph is aligned with an anomaly subgraph in the public
attributed network. The significant public anomaly subgraphs are selected for
federated private anomalies while preventing local private data leakage. The

thereby exposing underlying classical signals in the cross spectrum formed by
cross-correlating the two outputs in a GW interferometer's anti-symmetric port.
We explore here the prospects and analyze the sensitivity of using quantum
correlation to detect astrophysical GW signals. Conceptually, this technique is
similar to the correlation of two different GW detectors as it utilizes the
fact that a GW signal will be correlated in the two outputs but the shot noise
will be uncorrelated. Quantum correlation also has its unique advantages as it
requires only a single interferometer to make a detection. Therefore, quantum
correlation could increase the duty cycle, enhance the search efficiency, and
enable the detection of highly polarized signals. In particular, we show that
quantum correlation could be especially useful for detecting post-merger
remnants of binary neutron stars with both short ($< 1\,{\rm s}$) and
intermediate ($\sim 10-10^4\,{\rm s}$) durations and setting upper limits on

of L_iso=2.34x10^52 erg/s (both in the 400 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

open challenge. For vision-language data, the dominant approaches are based on
contrastive learning objectives that train a separate encoder for each

bias depending on the data augmentations used, which can degrade performance on
downstream tasks. Moreover, these methods are limited to paired image-text
data, and cannot leverage widely-available unpaired data. In this paper, we
investigate whether a large multimodal model trained purely via masked token
prediction, without using modality-specific encoders or contrastive learning,
can learn transferable representations for downstream tasks. We propose a
simple and scalable network architecture, the Multimodal Masked Autoencoder
(M3AE), which learns a unified encoder for both vision and language data via
masked token prediction. We provide an empirical study of M3AE trained on a
large-scale image-text dataset, and find that M3AE is able to learn
generalizable representations that transfer well to downstream tasks.
Surprisingly, we find that M3AE benefits from a higher text mask ratio
(50-90%), in contrast to BERT whose standard masking ratio is 15%, due to the
joint training of two data modalities. We also provide qualitative analysis
showing that the learned representation incorporates meaningful information

recent years, coordination in complex domains remains a challenge. Work in MARL
often focuses on solving tasks where agents interact with all other agents and
entities in the environment; however, we observe that real-world tasks are
often composed of several isolated instances of local agent interactions
(subtasks), and each agent can meaningfully focus on one subtask to the
exclusion of all else in the environment. In these composite tasks, successful
policies can often be decomposed into two levels of decision-making: agents are
allocated to specific subtasks and each agent acts productively towards their
assigned subtask alone. This decomposed decision making provides a strong
structural inductive bias, significantly reduces agent observation spaces, and
encourages subtask-specific policies to be reused and composed during training,
as opposed to treating each new composition of subtasks as unique. We introduce
ALMA, a general learning method for taking advantage of these structured tasks.
ALMA simultaneously learns a high-level subtask allocation policy and low-level

High-speed cameras are a popular tool to study these dynamics due to their

probes. High-speed video of thruster oscillations can be isolated (decomposed)
into coherent structures (modes) with algorithms that help us better understand
the evolution and interactions of each. This work provides an introduction,
comparison, and step-by-step tutorial on established Fourier and newer Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) algorithms as applied to high-speed video of the

of algorithms identify and characterize $m=0$ and $m>0$ modes in the discharge
channel and cathode regions of the thruster plume, as well as mode hopping
between the $m=3$ and $m=4$ rotating spokes in the channel. The Fourier methods
are ideal for characterizing linear modal structures and also provide intuitive
dispersion relationships. By contrast, the POD method tailors a basis set using
energy minimization techniques that better captures the nonlinear nature of
these structures and with a simpler implementation. Together, the Fourier and
POD methods provide a more complete toolkit for studying Hall thruster plasma
instabilities and mode dynamics. Specifically, we recommend first applying POD
first to quickly identify the nature and location of global dynamics and then
using Fourier methods to isolate dispersion plots and other wave-based physics.

approximately infer the effective behavior $a_{\text{hom}}$ of a stationary
random medium. The latter is described by a coefficient field $a(x)$ generated
from a given ensemble $\langle\cdot\rangle$ and the corresponding linear
elliptic operator $-\nabla\cdot a\nabla$. In line with the theory of
homogenization, the method proceeds by computing $d = 3$ correctors (d denoting
the space dimension).To be numerically tractable, this computation has to be
done on a finite domain: the so-called ""representative"" volume element, i. e. a
large box with, say, periodic boundary conditions. The main message of this
article is: Periodize the ensemble instead of its realizations. By this we mean
that it is better to sample from a suitably periodized ensemble than to
periodically extend the restriction of a realization $a(x)$ from the
whole-space ensemble $\langle\cdot\rangle$. We make this point by investigating
the bias (or systematic error), i. e. the difference between $a_{\text{hom}}$
and the expected value of the RVE method, in terms of its scaling w. r. t. the
lateral size $L$ of the box. In case of periodizing $a(x)$, we heuristically
argue that this error is generically $O(L^{-1})$. In case of a suitable
periodization of $\langle\cdot\rangle$, we rigorously show that it is
$O(L^{-d})$. In fact, we give a characterization of the leading-order error
term for both strategies, and argue that even in the isotropic case it is
generically non-degenerate. We carry out the rigorous analysis in the
convenient setting of ensembles $\langle\cdot\rangle$ of Gaussian type with
integrable covariance, which allow for a straightforward periodization and
which make the Price theorem and the Malliavin calculus available for optimal
stochastic estimates of correctors.

approximately behaves as a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid at scales larger
than the kinetic scale. As a result, classical fluid turbulence theory and
formalisms are often used to study turbulence in the MHD range. Therefore, a
Taylor microscale can be used to estimate an effective Reynolds number in the
solar wind. NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has reached progressively closer to
the Sun than any other spacecraft before. The collected data have revealed many
new findings in the near-Sun solar wind. Here, we use the PSP data to estimate
the Taylor microscale and effective Reynolds number near the Sun. We find that
the Taylor microscale and Reynolds number are small compared to the

The lack of broad emission could indicate obscuration of the innermost nuclear

Since high-energy X-rays can penetrate thick obscuring columns, they have the
power to distinguish these two scenarios. We present high-energy NuSTAR
observations of 9 Seyfert 2 AGN from the IRAS 12 micron survey, supplemented
with low-energy X-ray observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift. The

heavily obscured AGN, reaching into the Compton-thick regime for the highest

galaxies like the Milky Way. Many tidal stellar streams that have been found in
recent years are accompanied by a known progenitor globular cluster or dwarf
galaxy. However, the Orphan--Chenab (OC) stream is one case where a relatively
narrow stream of stars has been found without a known progenitor. In an effort
to find the parent of the OC stream, we use astrometry from the early third
data release of ESA's Gaia mission (Gaia EDR3) and radial velocity information
from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey to find up to 13 stars that are likely members
of the OC stream. We use the APOGEE survey to study the chemical nature (for up
to 13 stars) of the OC stream in the $\alpha$ (O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S), odd-Z
(Al, K, V), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Mn, Co, Cr) and neutron capture (Ce) elemental
groups. We find that the stars that make up the OC stream are not consistent
with a mono-metallic population and have a median metallicity of --1.92~dex
with a dispersion of 0.28 dex. Our results also indicate that the
$\alpha$-elements are depleted compared to the known Milky Way populations and
that its [Mg/Al] abundance ratio is not consistent with second generation stars
from globular clusters. The detailed chemical pattern of these stars indicates
that the OC stream progenitor is very likely to be a dwarf spheroidal galaxy
with a mass of ~10$^6$ M$_\odot$.

additional auxiliary labeled data. Based on posterior regularization, we
present the closed-form optimal solution to incorporate the token-level

theoretical analysis of how the approximation quality of NADO affects the

text generation with lexical constraints and (2) machine translation with

variables from the same set of features, improving predictive performance and
modeling accuracy relative to methods that handle each response variable
separately. Despite the potential of multi-task learning to yield more powerful
inference than single-task alternatives, prior work in this area has largely
omitted uncertainty quantification. Our focus in this paper is a common
multi-task problem in neuroimaging, where the goal is to understand the
relationship between multiple cognitive task scores (or other subject-level
assessments) and brain connectome data collected from imaging. We propose a
framework for selective inference to address this problem, with the flexibility
to: (i) jointly identify the relevant covariates for each task through a
sparsity-inducing penalty, and (ii) conduct valid inference in a model based on
the estimated sparsity structure. Our framework offers a new conditional
procedure for inference, based on a refinement of the selection event that
yields a tractable selection-adjusted likelihood. This gives an approximate
system of estimating equations for maximum likelihood inference, solvable via a
single convex optimization problem, and enables us to efficiently form
confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage. Applied to both
simulated data and data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study, our selective inference methods yield tighter confidence intervals than
commonly used alternatives, such as data splitting. We also demonstrate through
simulations that multi-task learning with selective inference can more
accurately recover true signals than single-task methods.

remains the most cost-effective approach to study wake flows and power losses
in wind farms. The underlying assumptions associated with turbulence closures
are one of the biggest sources of errors and uncertainties in the model
predictions. This work aims to quantify model-form uncertainties in RANS
simulations of wind farms at high Reynolds numbers under neutrally stratified
conditions by perturbing the Reynolds stress tensor through a data-driven
machine-learning technique. To this end, a two-step feature-selection method is
applied to determine key features of the model. Then, the extreme gradient
boosting algorithm is validated and employed to predict the perturbation amount
and direction of the modeled Reynolds stress toward the limiting states of
turbulence on the barycentric map. This procedure leads to a more accurate
representation of the Reynolds stress anisotropy. The data-driven model is
trained on high-fidelity data obtained from large-eddy simulation of a specific
wind farm, and it is tested on two other (unseen) wind farms with distinct
layouts to analyze its performance in cases with different turbine spacing and
partial wake. The results indicate that, unlike the data-free approach in which
a uniform and constant perturbation amount is applied to the entire
computational domain, the proposed framework yields an optimal estimation of
the uncertainty bounds for the RANS-predicted quantities of interest, including
the wake velocity, turbulence intensity, and power losses in wind farms.

important example is charge inversion or overcharging of electrical double

include correlations cannot capture the nonmonotonic dependence of charge
inversion on salt concentration because they have not systematically accounted
for the inhomogeneous nature of correlations from surface to the bulk and the
excluded volume effect of ions and solvent molecules. In this work, we modify
the Gaussian renormalized fluctuation theory by including the excluded volume
effect to study ion condensation and charge inversion. A boundary layer
approach is developed to accurately model the giant difference in ion
correlations between the condensed layer near the surface and the diffuse layer
outside. The theory is used to study charge inversion in multivalent
electrolytes and their mixtures. We predict a surface charge induced formation
of a three-dimensional condensed layer, which is necessary but not sufficient
for charge inversion. The value of the effective surface potential is found to

whether we solve these problems with loops (that take many iterations) or
without loops (that take only a few iterations) can significantly affect the
overall computational efficiency. Existing studies in the literature cover only
some of those implementation choices, and the complexity bounds available are
not refined enough to enable rigorous comparison among different

for both AID-BiO and ITD-BiO that are applicable to all implementation choices
of loops. We then specialize our results to characterize the computational
complexity for all implementations, which enable an explicit comparison among
them. Our result indicates that for AID-BiO, the loop for estimating the
optimal point of the inner function is beneficial for overall efficiency,
although it causes higher complexity for each update step, and the loop for
approximating the outer-level Hessian-inverse-vector product reduces the
gradient complexity. For ITD-BiO, the two loops always coexist, and our
convergence upper and lower bounds show that such loops are necessary to

from an unavoidable non-vanishing convergence error. Our numerical experiments

chemical accuracy for quantum chemistry). While the results of these algorithms
are imperfect, these imperfections can help bootstrap quantum computer testbed
development. Demonstrations of these algorithms over the past few years,
coupled with the idea that imperfect algorithm performance can be caused by
several dominant noise sources in the quantum processor, which can be measured
and calibrated during algorithm execution or in post-processing, has led to the
use of noise mitigation to improve computational results. Conversely, benchmark
algorithms coupled with noise mitigation can help diagnose the nature of noise,

mitigation techniques as a characterization tool in trapped-ion testbeds. We
perform model-fitting of the noisy data to determine the noise source based on
realistic noise models and demonstrate that systematic noise amplification
coupled with error mitigation schemes provides useful data for noise model
deduction. Further, in order to connect lower level noise model details with
application specific performance of near term algorithms, we experimentally
construct the loss landscape of a variational algorithm under various injected

Magnus force is also present, as in certain superconducting vortex or skyrmion

a finite Hall angle in the fluid phase but a vanishing Hall angle in the

three-stage training pipeline that reduces the training difficulty and prevents
the model from falling into local optima. Compared with the baselines in the

metallic phase for very lightly doped La2-xSrxCuO4, and finally a strong
self-consistent dependent strange metal phase with optimal levels of doping. In
the case of a triplet superconductor strontium ruthenate, three phases can be
differentiated from two families of Wigner distribution probabilities, one
family of WDP with point nodes where Cooper pairs and dressed scattered normal
quasiparticles are mixed for the whole range of frequencies and which
correspond to an FS $\gamma$ flat-sheet in the ground metallic state, and two
phases from another WPD family, where, in one of then, the Miyake-Narikiyo

presence of obstacles during path planning, which typically stems from the
usage of probabilistic occupancy grid maps for representing the environment
when mapping via a noisy sensor like a stereo camera. The traditional planning
paradigm prescribes using a hard threshold on the occupancy probability to
declare that a cell is an obstacle, and to plan a single path accordingly while
treating unknown space as free. We compare this approach against a new
uncertainty-aware planner, which plans two different path hypotheses and then
merges their initial trajectory segments into a single one ending in a
""next-best view"" pose. After this informative view is taken, the planner
commits to one of the hypotheses, or to a completely new one if a collision is
imminent. Simulations were conducted comparing the proposed and traditional
planner. Results show the existence of planning scenarios -- like when the
environment contains a dead-end, or when the goal is placed close to an
obstacle -- in which reasoning about uncertainty can significantly decrease the
robot's traveled distance and increase the chances of reaching the goal. The
new planner was also validated on a real Clearpath Jackal robot equipped with a
ZED 2 stereo camera.

models of lower-level auditory processing in the human brain rely on either
hand-constructed acoustic filters or representations from supervised audio
neural networks. In this work, we capitalize on the progress of self-supervised
speech representation learning (SSL) to create new state-of-the-art models of
the human auditory system. Compared against acoustic baselines, phonemic
features, and supervised models, representations from the middle layers of
self-supervised models (APC, wav2vec, wav2vec 2.0, and HuBERT) consistently
yield the best prediction performance for fMRI recordings within the auditory
cortex (AC). Brain areas involved in low-level auditory processing exhibit a
preference for earlier SSL model layers, whereas higher-level semantic areas
prefer later layers. We show that these trends are due to the models' ability
to encode information at multiple linguistic levels (acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical) along their representation depth. Overall, these results show that
self-supervised models effectively capture the hierarchy of information
relevant to different stages of speech processing in human cortex.

of the donor changes as a function of the remnant mass. This provides a more
self-consistent way to calculate the binding energy of the donor. For
comparison, we also calculate the binding energy through integrating the total
energy from the core to the surface. The outcome of CEE is constrained by total
energy conservation at the point at which both component's radii shrink back

For shorter orbital period sdBs, the binding energy is highly consistent. For
longer orbital period sdBs in our samples, the binding energy can differ by up

boundary layer flow is to adopt a near body reduced domain with boundary
conditions enforced to be compatible with a computationally cheaper 3D RANS
simulation. In such an approach it is desirable to enforce a consistent
pressure distribution which is not typically the case when using the standard
Riemann inflow boundary condition. We revisit the Riemann problem adopted in
many DG based high fidelity formulations. Through analysis of the 1D linearised
Euler equations it is demonstrated that maintaining entropy compatibility with
the RANS simulation is important for a stable solution. The maintenance of
Riemann invariant at outflow leaves one condition that can be imposed at the
inflow. Therefore the entropy-pressure enforcement is the only stable boundary
condition to enforce a known pressure distribution. We further demonstrate that
all the entropy compatible inflow Riemann boundary conditions are stable
providing the invariant compatible Riemann outflow boundary condition is also
respected. Although the entropy-pressure compatible Riemann inflow boundary
condition is stable from the 1D analysis, 2D tests highlight divergence in the
inviscid problem and neutrally stable wiggles in the velocity fields in viscous
simulations around the stagnation point. A 2D analysis about a non-uniform
baseflow assumption provides insight into this stability issue (ill-posedness)
and motivate the use of a mix of inflow boundary conditions in this region of

considerable research attention. Work on expressing temporal graph patterns or
discovering temporal motifs typically assumes relatively simple temporal
constraints, such as journeys or, more generally, existential constraints,
possibly with finite delays. In this paper we propose to use timed automata to
express temporal constraints, leading to a general and powerful notion of
temporal basic graph pattern (BGP). The new difficulty is the evaluation of the
temporal constraint on a large set of matchings. An important benefit of timed
automata is that they support an iterative state assignment, which can be
useful for early detection of matches and pruning of non-matches. We introduce
algorithms to retrieve all instances of a temporal BGP match in a graph, and
present results of an extensive experimental evaluation, demonstrating
interesting performance trade-offs. We show that an on-demand algorithm that
processes total matchings incrementally over time is preferable when dealing
with cyclic patterns on sparse graphs. On acyclic patterns or dense graphs, and
when connectivity of partial matchings can be guaranteed, the best performance
is achieved by maintaining partial matchings over time and allowing automaton
evaluation to be fully incremental.

the study of numerous chemical phenomena, which are computationally intractable

of molecules and materials depend on non-local electronic effects, which are
often neglected due to the difficulty of modeling them efficiently. This work
proposes a modified attention mechanism adapted to the underlying physics,
which allows to recover the relevant non-local effects. Namely, we introduce
spherical harmonic coordinates (SPHCs) to reflect higher-order geometric
information for each atom in a molecule, enabling a non-local formulation of
attention in the SPHC space. Our proposed model So3krates - a self-attention
based message passing neural network - uncouples geometric information from
atomic features, making them independently amenable to attention mechanisms.
Thereby we construct spherical filters, which extend the concept of continuous
filters in Euclidean space to SPHC space and serve as foundation for a
spherical self-attention mechanism. We show that in contrast to other published
methods, So3krates is able to describe non-local quantum mechanical effects
over arbitrary length scales. Further, we find evidence that the inclusion of
higher-order geometric correlations increases data efficiency and improves
generalization. So3krates matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on

generalization bounds of algorithms for solving nonconvex-(strongly)-concave
(NC-SC/NC-C) stochastic minimax optimization measured by the stationarity of
primal functions. We first establish algorithm-agnostic generalization bounds
via uniform convergence between the empirical minimax problem and the
population minimax problem. The sample complexities for achieving
$\epsilon$-generalization are $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\kappa^2\epsilon^{-2})$ and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-4})$ for NC-SC and NC-C settings,
respectively, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the condition number.
We further study the algorithm-dependent generalization bounds via stability
arguments of algorithms. In particular, we introduce a novel stability notion
for minimax problems and build a connection between generalization bounds and
the stability notion. As a result, we establish algorithm-dependent
generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA) algorithm
and the more general sampling-determined algorithms.

the foreground at each location on the background and pass the obtained

focus of scientific research for over two decades. Among others, supervised
sparsity-aware learning comprises two major paths paved by: a) discriminative
methods and b) generative methods. The latter, more widely known as Bayesian
methods, enable uncertainty evaluation w.r.t. the performed predictions.
Furthermore, they can better exploit related prior information and naturally
introduce robustness into the model, due to their unique capacity to
marginalize out uncertainties related to the parameter estimates. Moreover,
hyper-parameters associated with the adopted priors can be learnt via the
training data. To implement sparsity-aware learning, the crucial point lies in
the choice of the function regularizer for discriminative methods and the
choice of the prior distribution for Bayesian learning. Over the last decade or
so, due to the intense research on deep learning, emphasis has been put on
discriminative techniques. However, a come back of Bayesian methods is taking
place that sheds new light on the design of deep neural networks, which also
establish firm links with Bayesian models and inspire new paths for
unsupervised learning, such as Bayesian tensor decomposition.
  The goal of this article is two-fold. First, to review, in a unified way,
some recent advances in incorporating sparsity-promoting priors into three
highly popular data modeling tools, namely deep neural networks, Gaussian
processes, and tensor decomposition. Second, to review their associated
inference techniques from different aspects, including: evidence maximization
via optimization and variational inference methods. Challenges such as small
data dilemma, automatic model structure search, and natural prediction
uncertainty evaluation are also discussed. Typical signal processing and
machine learning tasks are demonstrated.

linear regression is critically important, but most metrics either only measure
local stability (i.e. against infinitesimal changes in the data), or are only
interpretable under statistical assumptions. Recent work proposes a simple,
global, finite-sample stability metric: the minimum number of samples that need
to be removed so that rerunning the analysis overturns the conclusion,
specifically meaning that the sign of a particular coefficient of the estimated
regressor changes. However, besides the trivial exponential-time algorithm, the
only approach for computing this metric is a greedy heuristic that lacks
provable guarantees under reasonable, verifiable assumptions; the heuristic
provides a loose upper bound on the stability and also cannot certify lower
bounds on it.
  We show that in the low-dimensional regime where the number of covariates is
a constant but the number of samples is large, there are efficient algorithms
for provably estimating (a fractional version of) this metric. Applying our
algorithms to the Boston Housing dataset, we exhibit regression analyses where
we can estimate the stability up to a factor of $3$ better than the greedy
heuristic, and analyses where we can certify stability to dropping even a
majority of the samples.

computing tasks, such as multi-object detection and tracking. The massive
amount of data transfer incurs significant energy, latency, and bandwidth
bottlenecks, which hinders real-time processing. To mitigate this problem, we
propose an algorithm-hardware co-design framework called
Processing-in-Pixel-in-Memory-based object Detection and Tracking
(P2M-DeTrack). P2M-DeTrack is based on a custom faster R-CNN-based model that
is distributed partly inside the pixel array (front-end) and partly in a
separate FPGA/ASIC (back-end). The proposed front-end in-pixel processing
down-samples the input feature maps significantly with judiciously optimized
strided convolution and pooling. Compared to a conventional baseline design
that transfers frames of RGB pixels to the back-end, the resulting P2M-DeTrack
designs reduce the data bandwidth between sensor and back-end by up to 24x. The
designs also reduce the sensor and total energy (obtained from in-house circuit
simulations at Globalfoundries 22nm technology node) per frame by 5.7x and
1.14x, respectively. Lastly, they reduce the sensing and total frame latency by
an estimated 1.7x and 3x, respectively. We evaluate our approach on the
multi-object object detection (tracking) task of the large-scale BDD100K
dataset and observe only a 0.5% reduction in the mean average precision (0.8%
reduction in the identification F1 score) compared to the state-of-the-art.

optimum scheduling band for each flow among three different frequency bands.
The proposed scheme also efficiently utilizes the resource to schedule flow

radiation from the atmospheres of stars. Compared to their solar counterparts,
our knowledge on the coronal plasma dynamics of stellar flares and their
connection to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) remains very limited. With
time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the
\textit{Chandra} X-ray observatory, we detected noticeable coronal plasma flows
during several stellar flares on a nearby dMe star EV Lac. In the observed
spectra of O~{\sc{viii}} (3 MK), Fe~{\sc{xvii}} (6 MK), Mg~{\sc{xii}} (10 MK),
and Si~{\sc{xiv}} (16 MK) lines, these flare-induced upflows/downflows appear
as significant Doppler shifts of several tens to \speed{130}, and the upflow
velocity generally increases with temperature. Variable line ratios of the
Si~{\sc{xiii}} triplet reveal that these plasma flows in most flares are
accompanied by an increase of the coronal plasma density and temperature. We
interpret these results as X-ray evidences for chromospheric evaporation on EV
Lac. In two successive flares, the plasma flow pattern and a sharp increase of
the measured coronal density are highly suggestive of explosive evaporation.
The transition from redshifts to blueshifts in such an explosive evaporation
occurs at a temperature of at least 10 MK, much higher than that observed in
solar flares ($\sim$1 MK). However, in one flare the cool and warm upflows
appear to be accompanied by a decreasing plasma density, which might be
explained by a stellar filament/prominence eruption coupled to this flare.
These results provide important clues to understand the coronal plasma dynamics
during flares on M dwarfs.

form, which reflects the coupling nature of pressure and water saturation in
the two-phase flow equation. The TgNN model not only relies on labeled data,
but also incorporates underlying scientific theory and experiential rules
(e.g., governing equations, stochastic parameter fields, boundary and initial
conditions, well conditions, and expert knowledge) as additional components
into the loss function. The performance of the TgNN-based surrogate model for
two-phase flow problems is tested by different numbers of labeled data and
collocation points, as well as the existence of data noise. The proposed
TgNN-based surrogate model offers an effective way to solve the coupled
nonlinear two-phase flow problem and demonstrates good accuracy and strong
robustness when compared with the purely data-driven surrogate model. By
combining the accurate TgNN-based surrogate model with the Monte Carlo method,
UQ tasks can be performed at a minimum cost to evaluate statistical quantities.
Since the heterogeneity of the random fields strongly impacts the results of
the surrogate model, corresponding variance and correlation length are added to
the input of the neural network to maintain its predictive capacity. The

fluctuations of hot QCD matter. In this paper, we investigate the
\textit{background effects}, namely the non-critical effects coming from the
non-trivial thermal background, on the light-nuclei production within the
framework of the coalescence model. Specifically, we analyze the impact of the
equilibrium phase-space distribution function of nucleons,
$f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p})$, on the light-nuclei yield ratio $N_tN_p/N_d^2$,
where $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ denote triton, proton, and deuteron yields. By
considering the characteristic function of the phase-space distribution, we
systematically expand the yield of light nuclei of $A$-constituent nucleons,
$N_A$, in terms of the \textit{phase-space cumulants},
$\langle\mathbf{r}^n\mathbf{p}^m\rangle_c$. We find that the cumulants up to
the second-order are canceled out in the generalized ratio $N_p^{B-A}
N_B^{A-1}/N_A^{B-1}$. This means that the dominant background effects including
the fireball size, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, and the
coordinate--momentum correlations caused by the radial expansion play an
insignificant role in the yield ratio, which supports the yield ratio as a
useful tool for the critical-point search. We also show several examples of
background phase-space distributions for the qualitative illustration. The
higher-order cumulants, which correspond to the non-Gaussian shape of the
phase-space profile, play an important role in the variation of the yield ratio
particularly for the smaller fireball sizes. Qualitatively, the spatial
structure of the background decreases the yield ratio, and the azimuthal
anisotropy $v_n$ increases it. The higher order of the azimuthal anisotropy
causes a larger effect on the yield ratio. These results call for the
comprehensive future studies of the yield ratio using sophisticated dynamical
models.

of node attributes should be consistent for an attributed network. However,
many existing methods ignore this property, even though they separately encode
node representations from network topology and node attributes meanwhile
clustering nodes on representation vectors learnt from one of the views.
Therefore, in this study, we propose an end-to-end deep embedded clustering

these challenges in this paper. Nevertheless, due to the changes of wireless
scenarios, the model mismatch of DL leads to the performance degradation of CE,
and thus faces the issue of network retraining. To address this issue, a
lightweight transfer learning (TL) network is further proposed for the DL-based
DNSP scheme, and thus structures a TL-based CE in OFDM systems. Specifically,
based on the linear receiver, the least squares estimation is first employed to
extract the initial features of CE. With the extracted features, we develop a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the solutions of DLbased CE and the
CE of DNSP. Finally, a lightweight TL network is constructed to address the
model mismatch. To this end, a novel CE network for the DNSP scheme in OFDM
systems is structured, which improves its estimation accuracy and alleviates
the model mismatch. The experimental results show that in all
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions, the proposed method achieves lower
normalized mean squared error (NMSE) than the existing DNSP schemes with
minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based CE. For example, when the SNR is 0
decibel (dB), the proposed scheme achieves similar NMSE as that of the
MMSE-based CE scheme at 20 dB, thereby significantly improving the estimation

Existing works on federated contextual bandits rely on linear or kernelized

number of items -- even with just two items and a single buyer (Briest et al.
2015, Hart and Nisan 2017).
  We introduce a new parameterized class of mechanisms, buy-$k$ mechanisms,
which smoothly interpolate between the classical buy-one mechanisms and the
recently studied buy-many mechanisms (Chawla et al. 2019, Chawla et al. 2020,
Chawla et al. 2022). Buy-$k$ mechanisms allow the buyer to buy up to $k$ many

incentive-compatible mechanisms suffices to overcome the bizarre, infinite
revenue properties of the buy-one model. Our main result is that the revenue
gap with respect to bundling, an extremely simple mechanism, is bounded by
$O(n^2)$ for any arbitrarily correlated distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $n$
items for the case of an additive buyer. Our techniques also allow us to prove
similar upper bounds for arbitrary monotone valuations, albeit with an
exponential factor in the approximation.
  On the negative side, we show that allowing the buyer to purchase a small
number of menu options does not suffice to guarantee sub-exponential
approximations, even when we weaken the benchmark to the optimal buy-$k$
deterministic mechanism. If an additive buyer is only allowed to buy $k =
\Theta(n^{1/2-\varepsilon})$ many menu options, the gap between the

Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most

compressible flow is probed via the Discrete Boltzmann Modeling (DBM) with
tracers. The distribution of tracers provides clear boundaries between light
and heavy fluids in the position space. Besides, the position-velocity phase
space offers a new perspective for understanding the flow behavior of RTI with
intuitive geometrical correspondence. The effects of viscosity, acceleration,
compressibility, and Atwood number on the mixing of material and momentum and
the mean non-equilibrium strength at the interfaces are investigated separately
based on both the mixedness defined by the tracers and the non-equilibrium
strength defined by the DBM. The mixedness increases with viscosity during
early stage but decreases with viscosity at the later stage. Acceleration,
compressibility, and Atwood number show enhancement effects on mixing based on
different mechanisms. After the system relaxes from the initial state, the mean
non-equilibrium strength at the interfaces presents an initially increasing and
then declining trend, which is jointly determined by the interface length and
the macroscopic physical quantity gradient. We conclude that the four factors
investigated all significantly affect early evolution behavior of RTI system,
such as the competition between interface length and macroscopic physical
quantity gradient. The results contribute to the understanding of the
multi-mode RTI evolutionary mechanism and the accompanied kinetic effects.

only accurate but also reliable. Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising
approach for obtaining the confidence of prediction results with fewer

need to refit the predictor for all possible values of prediction results,
which is only possible for simple predictors. For complex predictors such as
random forests (RFs) or neural networks (NNs), split-CP is often employed where
the data is split into two parts: one part for fitting and another to compute
the confidence set. Unfortunately, because of the reduced sample size, split-CP
is inferior to full-CP both in fitting as well as confidence set computation.
In this paper, we develop a full-CP of sparse high-order interaction model

full-CP of SHIM by introducing a novel approach called homotopy mining. Through

that there are often alternative solutions resembling different reasoning paths

during training and learn from both self-sampled fully-correct solutions, which
yield the correct answer upon execution, and partially-correct solutions, whose
intermediate state matches an intermediate state of a known correct solution.
We show that our use of self-sampled correct and partially-correct solutions

lack of complete understanding of the mechanically stable crystal structures of
these materials. As a first step towards understanding this issue, this paper
presents an ab initio study of stability of single-crystal mono- and bi-alkali
antimonides in the $D0_3$ structure, the structure generally assumed in the

are unstable in the $D0_3$ structure, we formulate a new set of
Goldschmidt-like tolerance factors that accurately predict $D0_3$ stability
using a procedure analogous to machine-learning perceptron-based analysis.
Next, we consider possible stable structures for materials that we predict to
be unstable in the $D0_3$ structure. Taking as examples the mono- and bi-alkali
antimonides Cs$_3$Sb and Cs$_2$KSb, which also are technologically interesting
for photoemission and photoabsorption applications, respectively, we note that
the most unstable phonon displacements are consistent with the cubic structure,
and we therefore perform extensive ab initio searches to identify potential
ground-state structures in a cubic lattice. Our X-ray diffraction experiments
confirm that indeed these two materials are not stable in the $D0_3$ structure
and show scattering that is consistent with our new, proposed stable
structures. Finally, we explore ab initio the implications of the breaking of
the $D0_3$ symmetry on the electronic structure, showing significant impact on
the location of the optical absorption edge.

us to generate a dataset containing multiple high-quality reference
translations for each source sentence. During the training, we compare the NAT
output with all references and select the one that best fits the NAT output to

drawn increasing attention in both control and machine learning communities. In
this paper, we study the sample complexity of stabilizing linear time-invariant
systems via Policy Gradient (PG) methods. Our analysis is built upon a
discounted Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) framework which alternatively
updates the policy and the discount factor of the LQR. In sharp contrast to the
existing literature, we propose an explicit rule to adaptively adjust the
discount factor by characterizing the stability margin using Lyapunov theory,
which has independent interests of its own. We show that the number of
iterations per discount factor is uniformly upper bounded, which enables us to
prove the sample complexity of stabilizing linear systems via PG methods.
Particularly, it only adds a coefficient logarithmic in the spectral radius of
the state matrix to the sample complexity of solving LQR problems. We perform
numerical experiments to verify our theoretical findings and empirically
evaluate the effectiveness of our results on nonlinear systems.

received great interest due to their outrageous scaling capability which
enables dramatical increases in model size without significant increases in
computational cost. To achieve this, MoE models replace the feedforward
sub-layer with Mixture-of-Experts sub-layer in transformers and use a gating
network to route each token to its assigned experts. Since the common practice
for efficient training of such models requires distributing experts and tokens
across different machines, this routing strategy often incurs huge
cross-machine communication cost because tokens and their assigned experts
likely reside in different machines. In this paper, we propose \emph{Gating
Dropout}, which allows tokens to ignore the gating network and stay at their
local machines, thus reducing the cross-machine communication. Similar to
traditional dropout, we also show that Gating Dropout has a regularization
effect during training, resulting in improved generalization performance. We
validate the effectiveness of Gating Dropout on multilingual machine
translation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Gating Dropout improves a
state-of-the-art MoE model with faster wall-clock time convergence rates and
better BLEU scores for a variety of model sizes and datasets.

observed in specific rare-earth-transition-metal ferrimagnetic alloys of

Aiming to resolve the conditions that allow switching, a series of experiments
have shown that the process in the ferrimagnetic alloys GdFeCo and

two very different ferrimagnetic alloys can be generally understood within a
single phenomenological framework describing the flow of angular momentum

time performance is dependent on heuristics, such as the choice of the next

emerged as a promising paradigm for branching. However, prior works have
struggled to apply reinforcement learning (RL), citing sparse rewards,

Instead, leading ML methodologies resort to approximating high quality

shorter trajectories with more predictable next states. In experiments on four

quantum eraser is conducted using a continuous wave laser to challenge the
quantum mystery. Unlike most delayed-choice experiments, the present

physics of the quantum eraser is found in selective measurements. To support
this understanding, analytical solutions for the macroscopic quantum eraser are

as multi-modal distillations in multiple stages or searching for task
relational contexts for each task. The core insight beyond these methods is to
maximize the mutual effects of each task. Inspired by the recent query-based
Transformers, we propose a simple pipeline named Multi-Query Transformer
(MQTransformer) that is equipped with multiple queries from different tasks to
facilitate the reasoning among multiple tasks and simplify the cross-task
interaction pipeline. Instead of modeling the dense per-pixel context among
different tasks, we seek a task-specific proxy to perform cross-task reasoning
via multiple queries where each query encodes the task-related context. The
MQTransformer is composed of three key components: shared encoder, cross-task
query attention module and shared decoder. We first model each task with a
task-relevant query. Then both the task-specific feature output by the feature
extractor and the task-relevant query are fed into the shared encoder, thus
encoding the task-relevant query from the task-specific feature. Secondly, we
design a cross-task query attention module to reason the dependencies among
multiple task-relevant queries; this enables the module to only focus on the
query-level interaction. Finally, we use a shared decoder to gradually refine
the image features with the reasoned query features from different tasks.
Extensive experiment results on two dense prediction datasets (NYUD-v2 and
PASCAL-Context) show that the proposed method is an effective approach and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

clustering under many different notions of fairness. Perhaps the most common
family of notions currently studied is group fairness, in which proportional
group representation is ensured in every cluster. We extend this direction by
considering the downstream application of clustering and how group fairness
should be ensured for such a setting. Specifically, we consider a common
setting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the
center of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its
corresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes,
positive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of
these two outcomes. To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire
proportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every
cluster as is done in group fair clustering. We provide algorithms for such
problems and show that in contrast to their NP-hard counterparts in group fair
clustering, they permit efficient solutions. We also consider a well-motivated
alternative setting where the decision-maker is free to assign labels to the
clusters regardless of the centers' positions in the metric space. We show that
this setting exhibits interesting transitions from computationally hard to easy
according to additional constraints on the problem. Moreover, when the
constraint parameters take on natural values we show a randomized algorithm for
this setting that always achieves an optimal clustering and satisfies the
fairness constraints in expectation. Finally, we run experiments on real world

displacement field and the topology are continuously varying unknown fields on

that prior solutions obtained from aligning trusses along the directions of

results in heterogeneous truss architectures with a smoothly varying unit cell,
enabling easy fabrication with a tunable length scale (the latter avoiding the
ill-posedness stemming from classical nonconvex methods without an intrinsic

that can result in security weaknesses. Automated analysis tools to detect
security smells in IaC scripts exist, but they focus on specific technologies

smell is implemented in one of the tools, it is not immediately available for
the technologies supported by the other tools -- the only option is to
duplicate the effort.
  This paper presents an approach that enables consistent security smell
detection across different IaC technologies. We conduct a large-scale empirical
study that analyzes security smells on three large datasets containing 196,755
IaC scripts and 12,281,251 LOC. We show that all categories of security smells
are identified across all datasets and we identify some smells that might
affect many IaC projects. To conduct this study, we developed GLITCH, a new
technology-agnostic framework that enables automated polyglot smell detection
by transforming IaC scripts into an intermediate representation, on which
different security smell detectors can be defined. GLITCH currently supports
the detection of nine different security smells in scripts written in Ansible,
Chef, or Puppet. We compare GLITCH with state-of-the-art security smell
detectors. The results obtained not only show that GLITCH can reduce the effort
of writing security smell analyses for multiple IaC technologies, but also that
it has higher precision and recall than the current state-of-the-art tools.

new benchmarks for segmentation on Cityscapes; and for classification on

architectures require fewer parameters to achieve these benchmarks compared to
the previous state-of-the-art. Moreover, when controlled for the number of

time, cost, and energy. To achieve these gains we used multi-level
two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) in WaveMix blocks, which
has the following advantages: (1) It reorganizes spatial information based on
three strong image priors -- scale-invariance, shift-invariance, and sparseness
of edges, (2) in a lossless manner without adding parameters, (3) while also
reducing the spatial sizes of feature maps, which reduces the memory and time
required for forward and backward passes, and (4) expanding the receptive field
faster than convolutions do. The whole architecture is a stack of self-similar
and resolution-preserving WaveMix blocks, which allows architectural
flexibility for various tasks and levels of resource availability. Our code and
trained models are publicly available.

have been widely used in blind face restoration (BFR) in recent years. Although
existing BFR methods have achieved good performance in ordinary cases, these
solutions have limited resilience when applied to face images with serious
degradation and pose-varied (e.g., looking right, looking left, laughing, etc.)
in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a well-designed blind face
restoration network with generative facial prior. The proposed network is
mainly comprised of an asymmetric codec and a StyleGAN2 prior network. In the
asymmetric codec, we adopt a mixed multi-path residual block (MMRB) to
gradually extract weak texture features of input images, which can better
preserve the original facial features and avoid excessive fantasy. The MMRB can
also be plug-and-play in other networks. Furthermore, thanks to the affluent
and diverse facial priors of the StyleGAN2 model, we adopt a fine-tuned
approach to flexibly restore natural and realistic facial details. Besides, a
novel self-supervised training strategy is specially designed for face
restoration tasks to fit the distribution closer to the target and maintain
training stability. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance to the prior
art for face restoration and face super-resolution tasks.

  Intervention",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Traditional content-based tag recommender systems directly learn the
association between user-generated content (UGC) and tags based on collected
UGC-tag pairs. However, since a UGC uploader simultaneously creates the UGC and
selects the corresponding tags, her personal preference inevitably biases the
tag selections, which prevents these recommenders from learning the causal
influence of UGCs' content features on tags. In this paper, we propose a deep
deconfounded content-based tag recommender system, namely, DecTag, to address
the above issues. We first establish a causal graph to represent the relations
among uploader, UGC, and tag, where the uploaders are identified as confounders
that spuriously correlate UGC and tag selections. Specifically, to eliminate
the confounding bias, causal intervention is conducted on the UGC node in the
graph via backdoor adjustment, where uploaders' influence on tags leaked
through backdoor paths can be eliminated for causal effect estimation.
Observing that adjusting the causal graph with do-calculus requires integrating
the entire uploader space, which is infeasible, we design a novel Monte Carlo
(MC)-based estimator with bootstrap, which can achieve asymptotic unbiasedness
provided that uploaders for the collected UGCs are i.i.d. samples from the
population. In addition, the MC estimator has the intuition of substituting the
biased uploaders with a hypothetical random uploader from the population in the
training phase, where deconfounding can be achieved in an interpretable manner.
Finally, we establish a YT-8M-Causal dataset based on the widely used
YouTube-8M dataset with causal intervention and propose an evaluation strategy
accordingly to unbiasedly evaluate causal tag recommenders. Extensive
experiments show that DecTag is more robust to confounding bias than
state-of-the-art causal recommenders.

paper, we numerically investigate the effects of the asymptotic velocities on
the physical structures of the accretion disk around the Kerr and
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) rapidly rotating black holes. The Bondi-Hoyle
accretion is considered with a falling gas towards the black hole in upstream
region of the computational domain. The shock cones are naturally produced in
the downstream part of the flow around both black holes. It is found that the
structure of the cones and the amount of the accreated matter depend on
asymptotic velocity $V_{\infty}$ (Mach number) and the types of the gravities
(Kerr or EGB). Increasing the Mach number of the inflowing matter in the
supersonic region causes the shock opening angle and accretion rates getting
smaller because of the rapidly falling gas towards the black hole. The EGB
gravity leads to an increase in the shock opening angle of the shock cones
while the mass accretion rates $\dot{M}$ are decreasing in EGB gravity with a
Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling constant $\alpha$. It is also confirmed that
accretion rates and drag forces are significantly altered in the EGB gravity.
Our numerical simulation results could be used to identify the accreation
mechanism and physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole in the

are an uncontrolled one-loop calculation in exactly two dimensions, and two
$d=(d_c-\epsilon)$-expansions to $O(\epsilon)$, obtained by two different
analytic continuations of our 2D model to higher spatial dimensions: a ``hard""
continuation which has $d_c={7\over 3}$, and a ``soft"" continuation with
$d_c={5\over 2}$. Surprisingly, the quenched and annealed parts of the velocity
correlation function have the same anisotropy exponent and the relaxational and
propagating parts of the dispersion relation have the same dynamic exponent in
the nonlinear theory even though they are distinct in the linearized theory.
This is due to anomalous hydrodynamics. Furthermore, all three renormalization
schemes yield very similar values for the universal exponents, and, therefore,
we expect the numerical values we predict for them to be highly accurate.

certain ions to pass through the membrane, while preventing the others. The

rate and maintaining coherence in ion channels. Using the Lindblad equation to
describe a three-level system, the results in different quantum regimes are
examined. We studied the distillable coherence and the second order coherence

simultaneous solutions of (virtually) any modified theory of gravity coupled

accompanied by pure radiation in the (anti-)Nariai background. The results are
exemplified for the case of Born-Infeld, ModMax and Horndeski electrodynamics.

  Document-Level Relation Extraction","Accepted by NAACL 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compared with traditional sentence-level relation extraction, document-level
relation extraction is a more challenging task where an entity in a document
may be mentioned multiple times and associated with multiple relations.
However, most methods of document-level relation extraction do not distinguish
between mention-level features and entity-level features, and just apply simple
pooling operation for aggregating mention-level features into entity-level
features. As a result, the distinct semantics between the different mentions of
an entity are overlooked. To address this problem, we propose RSMAN in this
paper which performs selective attentions over different entity mentions with
respect to candidate relations. In this manner, the flexible and
relation-specific representations of entities are obtained which indeed benefit
relation classification. Our extensive experiments upon two benchmark datasets
show that our RSMAN can bring significant improvements for some backbone models

motivations in their trips. Thus, it is critical to discover travel patterns
involving multi-destinations in tourism research. Existing relevant research
most relied on survey data or focused on citizens due to the lack of
large-scale, fine-grained tourism datasets. Several scholars have mentioned the
notion of trip chains, but few works have been done towards quantitatively
identifying the structures of trip chains. In this paper, we propose a model
for quantitatively characterizing tourist daily trip chains. After applying
this model to tourist mobile phone big data, underlying tourist travel patterns
are discovered. Through the framework, we find that: (1) Most ""hybrid""
(inter-city and intra-city) and ""intra-city"" (only intra-city) patterns can be
captured by only 13 key trip chains relatively; (2) For two continuous days,
almost all kinds of original chains have a rather high probability to transfer
to either the first two transferred chains, or other infrequent chains in our
study areas; (3) The principle of least efforts (PLE) affects tourists'
structures of trip chains. We can use average degree and average travel
distance to interpret tourist travel behavior (achieving tasks in PLE). This
study not only demonstrate the complex daily travel trip chains from tourism
big data, but also fill the gap in tourism literature on multi-destination
trips by discovering significant and underlying patterns based on mobile

processes, such as the spreading of a pandemic in a city. Such models proceed
by specifying the behavior of individuals (agents) and their interactions, and
parameterizing the process of infection based on such interactions based on the
geography and demography of the city. However, such models are computationally
very expensive, and the complexity is often linear in the total number of
agents. This seriously limits the usage of such models for simulations, which
often have to be run hundreds of times for policy planning and even model
parameter estimation. An alternative is to develop an emulator, a surrogate
model that can predict the Agent-Based Simulator's output based on its initial
conditions and parameters. In this paper, we discuss a Deep Learning model
based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network that can emulate such an agent
based model with high accuracy. We show that use of this model instead of the
original Agent-Based Model provides us major gains in the speed of simulations,
allowing much quicker calibration to observations, and more extensive scenario
analysis. The models we consider are spatially explicit, as the locations of
the infected individuals are simulated instead of the gross counts. Another
aspect of our emulation framework is its divide-and-conquer approach that
divides the city into several small overlapping blocks and carries out the
emulation in them parallelly, after which these results are merged together.
This ensures that the same emulator can work for a city of any size, and also
provides significant improvement of time complexity of the emulator, compared
to the original simulator.

pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains
an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D
representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose
Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical
self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in
MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to
progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and
high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point
tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate
consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial
self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns.
By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples
point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which
further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after
pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40,
even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks,
Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best,
and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D
object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme. Code is available

nonlinear spinor field is suggested. By analogy with Abelian magnetic monopole
dominance in quantum chromodynamics, it is assumed that the dominant
contribution to such vacuum is coming from quasiparticles described by
dipolelike solutions existing in this theory. Using an assumption of the
behavior of the number density of quasiparticles whose energy approaches
infinity, we derive an approximate expression for the energy density of such
nonperturbative vacuum, which turns out to be finite, unlike an infinite energy
density of perturbative vacuum. Using characteristic values of the parameters
appearing in the expression for the nonperturbative energy density, it is shown
that this density may be of the order of the energy density associated with
Einstein's cosmological constant. The physical interpretation of the spinor

unstructured spatial-temporal relations that exist in the sound signals.
Recently, many studies have focused on abstracting features from convolutional
neural networks while the learning of semantically relevant frames of sound
signals has been overlooked. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework,
namely feature pyramid attention network (FPAM), focusing on abstracting the
semantically relevant features for ESC. We first extract the feature maps of
the preprocessed spectrogram of the sound waveform by a backbone network. Then,
to build multi-scale hierarchical features of sound spectrograms, we construct
a feature pyramid representation of the sound spectrograms by aggregating the
feature maps from multi-scale layers, where the temporal frames and spatial
locations of semantically relevant frames are localized by FPAM. Specifically,
the multiple features are first processed by a dimension alignment module.
Afterward, the pyramid spatial attention module (PSA) is attached to localize
the important frequency regions spatially with a spatial attention module
(SAM). Last, the processed feature maps are refined by a pyramid channel
attention (PCA) to localize the important temporal frames. To justify the
effectiveness of the proposed FPAM, visualization of attention maps on the
spectrograms has been presented. The visualization results show that FPAM can
focus more on the semantic relevant regions while neglecting the noises. The
effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated on two widely used ESC
datasets: the ESC-50 and ESC-10 datasets. The experimental results show that
the FPAM yields comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. A
substantial performance increase has been achieved by FPAM compared with the
baseline methods.

  Electricity and Heating Market Considering Privacy Preservation",,,,,"cs.GT math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a doubled-sided auction mechanism with price
discrimination for social welfare (SW) maximization in the electricity and
heating market. In this mechanism, energy service providers (ESPs) submit
offers and load aggregators (LAs) submit bids to an energy trading center (ETC)
to maximize their utility; in turn, the selfless ETC as an auctioneer leverages
dis-criminatory price weights to regulate the behaviors of ESPs and LAs, which
combines the individual benefits of each stakeholder with the overall social
welfare to achieve the global optimum. Nash games are employed to describe the
interactions between players with the same market role. Theoretically, we first
prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium; then, considering
the requirement of game players to preserve privacy, a distributed algorithm
based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to
implement distributed bidding and analytical target cascading algorithm is
applied to reach the balance of demand and supply. We validated the proposed
mechanism using case studies on a city-level distribution system. The results
indicated that the achieved SW improved by 4%-15% compared with other
mechanisms, and also verified the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm.

  Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Transformers have shown great power in time series forecasting due to their
global-range modeling ability. However, their performance can degenerate
terribly on non-stationary real-world data in which the joint distribution
changes over time. Previous studies primarily adopt stationarization to
attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability.
But the stationarized series deprived of inherent non-stationarity can be less
instructive for real-world bursty events forecasting. This problem, termed
over-stationarization in this paper, leads Transformers to generate
indistinguishable temporal attentions for different series and impedes the
predictive capability of deep models. To tackle the dilemma between series
predictability and model capability, we propose Non-stationary Transformers as
a generic framework with two interdependent modules: Series Stationarization
and De-stationary Attention. Concretely, Series Stationarization unifies the
statistics of each input and converts the output with restored statistics for
better predictability. To address the over-stationarization problem,
De-stationary Attention is devised to recover the intrinsic non-stationary
information into temporal dependencies by approximating distinguishable
attentions learned from raw series. Our Non-stationary Transformers framework
consistently boosts mainstream Transformers by a large margin, which reduces
MSE by 49.43% on Transformer, 47.34% on Informer, and 46.89% on Reformer,
making them the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting. Code is available

formation. Shocks produced by supernova explosions, jets, radiation from
massive stars, or galactic spiral-arm dynamics are amongst the most common
drivers of turbulence in the ISM. However, it is not fully understood how
shocks drive turbulence, in particular whether shock driving is a more
solenoidal(rotational, divergence-free) or a more compressive (potential,
curl-free) mode of driving turbulence. The mode of turbulence driving has
profound consequences for star formation, with compressive driving producing
three times larger density dispersion, and an order of magnitude higher star
formation rate than solenoidal driving. Here, we use hydrodynamical simulations
of a shock inducing turbulent motions in a structured, multi-phase medium. This
is done in the context of a laser-induced shock, propagating into a foam
material, in preparation for an experiment to be performed at the National
Ignition Facility (NIF). Specifically, we analyse the density and velocity
distributions in the shocked turbulent medium, and measure the turbulence
driving parameter $b=(\sigma^{2 \Gamma}_{\rho /\langle \rho \rangle}-1)^{1/2}
(1-\sigma_{\rho \langle \rho
\rangle}^{-2})^{-1/2}\mathcal{M}^{-1}\Gamma^{-1/2}$ with the density dispersion
$\sigma_{\rho / \langle \rho \rangle}$, the turbulent Mach number
$\mathcal{M}$, and the polytropic exponent $\Gamma$. Purely solenoidal and
purely compressive driving correspond to $b \sim 1/3$ and $b \sim 1$,
respectively. Using simulations in which a shock is driven into a multi-phase
medium with structures of different sizes and $\Gamma < 1$, we find $b \sim 1$
for all cases, showing that shock-driven turbulence is consistent with strongly
compressive driving.

intercalated with alkali elements. How intercalation modifies the structure is
known from in-situ X-ray and neutron scattering techniques, but why T$_{c}$
changes so dramatically is not known. Here we show that there is one-to-one
correspondence between the enhancement in magnetic instabilities at certain
$\bf q$ vectors and superconducting pairing vertex, even while the nuclear spin
relaxation rate ${1}/{(T_{1}T)}$ may not reflect this enhancement.
Intercalation modifies electronic screening both in the plane and also between

from each such changes in electronic screening. Intercalated FeSe provides an
archetypal example of superconductivity where information derived from the
single-particle electronic structure appears to be insufficient to account for
the origins of superconductivity, even when they are computed including
correlation effects. We show that the five-fold enhancement in T$_{c}$ on
intercalation is not sensitive to the exact position of the d$_{xy}$ at
$\Gamma$ point, as long as it stays close to E$_{F}$. Finally we show that
intercalation also significantly softens the collective charge excitations,
suggesting the electron-phonon interaction could play some role in intercalated
FeSe.

appeared on the scene as a flexible and versatile framework for solving partial

hypocenter locations using HypoPINN and investigates the propagation of
uncertainties from the random realizations of HypoPINN's weights and biases

original network by adding or removing links, and expect the embedding
generated on the perturbed network can leak little information about private

factorization with closed form embedding results, we devise efficient privacy
gain and utility loss approximation methods to avoid the repetitive
time-consuming embedding training for every candidate network perturbation in

of elements present in these illustrations, such as humans, creatures,
artifacts, and landscapes - not to mention the plethora of art styles of the

we introduced a novel dataset, named MTG, with thousands of illustration from
diverse card types and rich in metadata. The resulting set is a dataset
composed by a myriad of both realistic and fantasy-like illustrations.
Although, to investigate effects of diversity we also introduced subsets that
contain specific types of concepts, such as forests, islands, faces, and
humans. We show that simpler models, such as DCGANs, are not able to learn to
generate proper illustrations in any setting. On the other side, we train
instances of MAGICSTYLEGAN using all proposed subsets, being able to generate
high quality illustrations. We perform experiments to understand how well
pre-trained features from StyleGan2 can be transferred towards the target

Moreover, we provide both quantitative and qualitative studies to support our
claims, and that demonstrate that MAGICSTYLEGAN is the state-of-the-art
approach for generating Magic illustrations. Finally, this paper highlights
some emerging properties regarding transfer learning in GANs, which is still a

showing inferior performance on data-insufficient downstream tasks.

analyzing the properties of the layer representation and attention maps for

during inference. We ascribe the bottleneck to a failure of exploring the
intrinsic semantic hierarchy of visual concepts, e.g. \{red, blue,...\} $\in$
`color' subspace yet cube $\in$ `shape'. In this paper, we propose a visual
superordinate abstraction framework for explicitly modeling semantic-aware
visual subspaces (i.e. visual superordinates). With only natural visual
question answering data, our model first acquires the semantic hierarchy from a
linguistic view, and then explores mutually exclusive visual superordinates
under the guidance of linguistic hierarchy. In addition, a quasi-center visual
concept clustering and a superordinate shortcut learning schemes are proposed
to enhance the discrimination and independence of concepts within each visual
superordinate. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed

exploits large-strain plastic flow past a sharp wedge, coupled with high-speed

dynamics. The inverse problem of estimating material parameters from the flow
field is solved using an iterative optimization procedure that minimizes the
gap between internal and external plastic work. A major advantage of the method
is that it neither makes any assumptions about the flow nor requires

meanwhile maintains structural information so that the latent matrix factor
feature can perfectly replace the intractable matrix-variate owing to
high-dimensionality. The estimation procedure of LaGMaR is subtly derived by
transforming the bilinear form matrix factor model onto a high-dimensional
vector factor model, so that the method of principle components can be applied.
We establish bilinear-form consistency of the estimated matrix coefficient of
the latent predictor and consistency of prediction. The proposed approach can
be implemented conveniently. Through simulation experiments, prediction
capability of LaGMaR is shown to outperform existing penalized methods under
diverse scenarios of generalized matrix regressions. Through the application to
a real COVID-19 dataset, the proposed approach is shown to predict efficiently
the COVID-19.

to suggest the presence of a counter-rotation in the obscuring torus of NGC
1068. We propose to explain this phenomenon as due to the influence of a wind,
considered as radiation pressure, and the effects of torus orientation. In
order to test this idea: 1. we make $N$-body simulation of a clumpy torus
taking into account mutual forces between particles (clouds); 2. we apply
ray-tracing algorithm with the beams from the central engine to choose the
clouds in the torus throat that can be under direct influence of the accretion
disk emission; 3. we use semi-analytical model to simulate the influence of the
asymmetrical radiation pressure (wind) forced on the clouds in the torus
throat. An axis of such a wind is tilted with respect to the torus symmetry
axis; 4. we orient the torus relative to an observer and again apply
ray-tracing algorithm. In this step the beams go from an observer to the
optically thick clouds that allows us to take into account the mutual
obscuration of clouds; 5. after projecting on the picture plane, we impose a
grid on the resulting cloud distribution and find the mean velocity of clouds
in each cells to mimic the ALMA observational maps. By choosing the parameters
corresponding to NGC 1068 we obtain the model velocity maps that emulate the
effect of an apparent counter-rotation and can explain the discovery made by
ALMA.

points and propose an efficient method called Meta-Semantic Learning
(Meta-SeL). Meta-SeL is an integrated framework that leverages two input 3D
local points (input 3D models and part-segmentation labels), providing a time
and cost-efficient, and precise projection model for a number of 3D recognition
tasks. The results indicate that Meta-SeL yields competitive performance in
comparison with other complex state-of-the-art work. Moreover, being random
shuffle invariant, Meta-SeL is resilient to translation as well as jittering
noise.

systems such as face recognition and suspect identification. Compared to other
image retrieval tasks, facial image retrieval is more challenging due to the
high subjectivity involved in describing a person's facial features. Existing
methods do so by comparing specific characteristics from the user's mental
image against the suggested images via high-level supervision such as using
natural language. In contrast, we propose a method that uses a relatively
simpler form of binary supervision by utilizing the user's feedback to label
images as either similar or dissimilar to the target image. Such supervision
enables us to exploit the contrastive learning paradigm for encapsulating each
user's personalized notion of similarity. For this, we propose a novel loss
function optimized online via user feedback. We validate the efficacy of our
proposed approach using a carefully designed testbed to simulate user feedback
and a large-scale user study. Our experiments demonstrate that our method
iteratively improves personalization, leading to faster convergence and
enhanced recommendation relevance, thereby, improving user satisfaction. Our
proposed framework is also equipped with a user-friendly web interface with a
real-time experience for facial image retrieval.

for facilitating a diagnosis of COVID-19 in a more efficient and comprehensive

been applied to perform COVID-19 infection region segmentation and disease
classification by analyzing CXR and CT data. However, prediction uncertainty of
deep learning models for these tasks, which is very important to
safety-critical applications like medical image processing, has not been
comprehensively investigated. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble deep
learning model through integrating bagging deep learning and model calibration
to not only enhance segmentation performance, but also reduce prediction
uncertainty. The proposed method has been validated on a large dataset that is
associated with CXR image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method can improve the segmentation performance, as well as
decrease prediction uncertainties.

powerful graph neural networks (GNN) that succeed in predicting material

strategy to extract high-level material representations by utilizing
self-supervised training of GNN on large-scale unlabeled datasets. According to
the dimensional reduction analysis, we find that the learned knowledge about

representations. Compared with popular manually constructed descriptors and
crystal graph convolutional neural networks, self-supervised material
representations can help us obtain a more accurate and efficient model for

serve as a universal pre-training framework for various material properties.
