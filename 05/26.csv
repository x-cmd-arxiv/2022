the traditional definition of stable matching in finite markets and the
continuum definition of stable matching from Azevedo and Leshno (2016) as
special cases. Within this framework, I identify a novel continuum model, which
makes individual-level probabilistic predictions.
  This new model always has a unique stable outcome, which can be found using
an analog of the Deferred Acceptance algorithm. The crucial difference between
this model and that of Azevedo and Leshno (2016) is that they assume that the
amount of student interest at each school is deterministic, whereas my proposed
alternative assumes that it follows a Poisson distribution. As a result, this
new model accurately predicts the simulated distribution of cutoffs, even for
markets with only ten schools and twenty students.
  This model generates new insights about the number and quality of matches.
When schools are homogeneous, it provides upper and lower bounds on students'
average rank, which match results from Ashlagi, Kanoria and Leshno (2017) but
apply to more general settings. This model also provides clean analytical
expressions for the number of matches in a platform pricing setting considered
by Marx and Schummer (2021).

trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) we predicted a stellar occultation by the TNO
(38628) Huya of the star Gaia DR2 4352760586390566400 (mG = 11.5 mag.) for
March 18, 2019. After an extensive observational campaign, we updated the
prediction and it turned out to be favorable to central Europe. Therefore, we
mobilized half a hundred professional and amateur astronomers, and the
occultation was finally detected from 21 telescopes located at 18 sites. This
makes the Huya event one of the best ever observed stellar occultation by a TNO
in terms of the number of chords. We determine accurate size, shape, and
geometric albedo, and we also provide constraints on the density and other
internal properties of this TNO. The 21 positive detections of the occultation
by Huya allowed us to obtain well-separated chords which permitted us to fit an
ellipse for the limb of the body at the moment of the occultation (i.e., the
instantaneous limb) with kilometric accuracy. The projected semi-major and
minor axes of the best ellipse fit obtained using the occultation data are (a',
b') = (217.6 $\pm$ 3.5 km, 194.1 $\pm$ 6.1 km) with a position angle of the
minor axis P' = 55.2 $\pm$ 9.1 degrees. From this fit, the projected
area-equivalent diameter is 411.0 $\pm$ 7.3 km. This diameter is compatible
with the equivalent diameter for Huya obtained from radiometric techniques (D =
406 $\pm$ 16 km). From this instantaneous limb, we obtained the geometric
albedo for Huya (p$\rm_V$ = 0.079 $\pm$ 0.004) and we explored possible 3D
shapes and constraints to the mass density for this TNO. We did not detect the
satellite of Huya through this occultation, but the presence of rings or debris
around Huya is constrained using the occultation data. We also derived an upper
limit for a putative Pluto-like global atmosphere of about p$_{\rm surf}$ = 10
nbar.

novel Multi-Granularity Perception Network (MGPN) that perceives intra-modality

fine-grained feature encoder and a conditioned interaction module are
introduced to enhance the initial perception inspired by how humans address

burden of some existing methods, we further design an efficient choice

QC-MDPC codes, has become an established solution to design secure and
efficient code-based public-key encryption schemes, as also witnessed by the
ongoing NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. However,
similar approaches have been less fortunate in the context of code-based
digital signatures, since no secure and efficient signature scheme based on
these codes is available to date. The main limitation of previous attempts in
this line of research has been the use of sparse signatures, which produces
some leakage of information about the private key. In this paper, we propose a
new code-based digital signature scheme that overcomes such a problem by
publishing signatures that are abnormally dense, rather than sparse. This
eliminates the possibility of deducing information from the sparsity of
signatures, and follows a recent trend in code-based cryptography exploiting
the hardness of the decoding problem for large-weight vectors, instead of its
classical version based on small-weight vectors. In this study we focus on
one-time use and provide some preliminary instances of the new scheme, showing
that it achieves very fast signature generation and verification with
reasonably small public keys.

significant periods of sea-level change in recent geologic history. During this
period, evaporite deposition throughout the Mediterranean basin records a
series of dramatic environmental changes as flow through the Strait of
Gibraltar was restricted. In the first stage of evaporite deposition, cycles of
gypsum appear in shallow basins on the margins of the Mediterranean. The
complex environmental history giving rise to these cycles has been investigated
for decades but remains controversial. Notably, whether the evaporites are
connected to significant changes in Mediterranean sea-level is an open
question. In one proposed model, competition between tectonic uplift and
erosion at the Strait of Gibraltar gives rise to self-sustaining sea-level
oscillations -- limit cycles -- which trigger evaporite deposition. Here I show
that limit cycles are not a robust result of the proposed model and discuss how
any oscillations produced by this model depend on an unrealistic formulation of
a key model equation. First, I simplify the model equations and test whether
limit cycles are produced in 64 million unique combinations of model
parameters, finding oscillations in only 0.2 % of all simulations. Next, I
examine the formulation of a critical model equation representing stream
channel slope over the Strait of Gibraltar, concluding that a more realistic
formulation would render sea-level limit cycles improbable, if not impossible,

performance of all jobs (both successfully completed and canceled), in this
work we explore scheduling policies that improve the sojourn time of successful
jobs, which are typically more valuable to the user. Our model assumes that
each job has a known discrete size distribution (e.g., estimated from previous
execution logs) where the largest size value indicates a successful completion,
while other size values correspond to termination checkpoints. In the
single-server case where all jobs are available for scheduling simultaneously,
we prove that optimal schedules do not preempt jobs, even when preemption
overhead is negligible. Based on this, we develop a scheduling policy that
minimizes the sojourn time of successful jobs asymptotically, i.e., when the
number of jobs grows to infinity. Through an extensive numerical study, we show
that this policy performs better than existing alternatives even when the
number of jobs is finite. For more realistic scenarios with multiple servers

that scale with an increased cost of living. This work investigates the extent
to which postdoc wages account for cost-of-living differences. More than 27,000
postdoc salaries across all US universities are analyzed alongside measures of
regional differences in cost of living. We find that postdoc salaries do not
account for cost-of-living differences, in contrast with the broader labor
market in the same cities and towns. Despite a modest increase in income in
high cost of living areas, real (cost of living adjusted) postdoc salaries
differ by 29% ($15k 2021 USD) between the least and most expensive areas.
Cities that produce greater numbers of tenure-track faculty relative to

Moreover, these systems must constrain the adjacent channel leakage ratio

systems. It is based on the idea that all items or item groups should get
exposure proportional to the merit of the item or the collective merit of the
items in the group. Often, stochastic ranking policies are used to ensure
fairness of exposure. Previous work unrealistically assumes that we can
reliably estimate the expected exposure for all items in each ranking produced
by the stochastic policy. In this work, we discuss how to approach fairness of
exposure in cases where the policy contains rankings of which, due to
inter-item dependencies, we cannot reliably estimate the exposure distribution.
In such cases, we cannot determine whether the policy can be considered fair.
Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we define a method called
FELIX for finding stochastic policies that avoid showing rankings with unknown
exposure distribution to the user without having to compromise user utility or
item fairness. Second, we extend the study of fairness of exposure to the top-k
setting and also assess FELIX in this setting. We find that FELIX can
significantly reduce the number of rankings with unknown exposure distribution
without a drop in user utility or fairness compared to existing fair ranking
methods, both for full-length and top-k rankings. This is an important first
step in developing fair ranking methods for cases where we have incomplete
knowledge about the user's behaviour.

increasingly attractive to recover the latent global shutter (GS) video from

Existing solutions, using deep neural networks or optimization, achieve
promising performance. However, these methods generate intermediate GS frames
through image warping based on the RS model, which inevitably result in black
holes and noticeable motion artifacts. In this paper, we alleviate these issues
by proposing a context-aware GS video reconstruction architecture. It
facilitates the advantages such as occlusion reasoning, motion compensation,
and temporal abstraction. Specifically, we first estimate the bilateral motion
field so that the pixels of the two RS frames are warped to a common GS frame
accordingly. Then, a refinement scheme is proposed to guide the GS frame
synthesis along with bilateral occlusion masks to produce high-fidelity GS
video frames at arbitrary times. Furthermore, we derive an approximated
bilateral motion field model, which can serve as an alternative to provide a
simple but effective GS frame initialization for related tasks. Experiments on

(CSiBORG) produced using the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies

completion is required to produce dense depth maps for 3D perception. We
address this task with realistic illumination and sensor resolution constraints
by simulating ToF datasets for indoor 3D perception with challenging sparsity
levels. We propose a quantized convolutional encoder-decoder network for this
task. Our model achieves optimal depth map quality by means of input
pre-processing and carefully tuned training with a geometry-preserving loss
function. We also achieve low memory footprint for weights and activations by
means of mixed precision quantization-at-training techniques. The resulting
quantized models are comparable to the state of the art in terms of quality,
but they require very low GPU times and achieve up to 14-fold memory size
reduction for the weights w.r.t. their floating point counterpart with minimal
impact on quality metrics.

  Microscopic Imaging using Digital Holography",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Digital holography is a 3D imaging technique by emitting a laser beam with a
plane wavefront to an object and measuring the intensity of the diffracted
waveform, called holograms. The object's 3D shape can be obtained by numerical
analysis of the captured holograms and recovering the incurred phase. Recently,
deep learning (DL) methods have been used for more accurate holographic
processing. However, most supervised methods require large datasets to train
the model, which is rarely available in most DH applications due to the
scarcity of samples or privacy concerns. A few one-shot DL-based recovery
methods exist with no reliance on large datasets of paired images. Still, most
of these methods often neglect the underlying physics law that governs wave
propagation. These methods offer a black-box operation, which is not
explainable, generalizable, and transferrable to other samples and
applications. In this work, we propose a new DL architecture based on
generative adversarial networks that uses a discriminative network for
realizing a semantic measure for reconstruction quality while using a
generative network as a function approximator to model the inverse of hologram
formation. We impose smoothness on the background part of the recovered image
using a progressive masking module powered by simulated annealing to enhance
the reconstruction quality. The proposed method is one of its kind that
exhibits high transferability to similar samples, which facilitates its fast
deployment in time-sensitive applications without the need for retraining the
network. The results show a considerable improvement to competitor methods in
reconstruction quality (about 5 dB PSNR gain) and robustness to noise (about
50% reduction in PSNR vs noise increase rate).

these needs and proposes a Bayesian inference framework for semantic mapping

correctly predicts terrain properties in both cases. The proposed framework

assume the temperature measured by the Galileo probe (Seiff et al. 1998).
However, those data correspond to a single location, an unusually clear, dry
region, affected by local atmospheric dynamics. On the other hand, the Voyager
radio occultation observations cover a wider range of latitudes, longitudes,
and times (Lindal et al. 1981). The Voyager retrievals were based on
atmospheric composition and radio refractivity data that require updating and
were never properly tabulated: the few existing tabulations are incomplete and
ambiguous. Here, we present a systematic electronic digitization of all
available temperature profiles from Voyager, followed by their reanalysis,
employing currently accepted values of the abundances and radio refractivities
of atmospheric species. We find the corrected temperature at the 1 bar level to

characterization and gate optimization will be a non-scalable and

quantum processors are very sensitive to the external environment, with control
hardware parameters slowly drifting during operation, affecting gate fidelity.
Currently, existing calibration techniques require complex and lengthy
measurements to independently control the different parameters of each gate and
are unscalable to large quantum systems. Therefore, fully automated protocols
with the desired functionalities are required to speed up the calibration
process. This paper aims to propose single-qubit calibration of superconducting
qubits under continuous weak measurements from a real physical experimental
settings point of view. We propose a real-time optimal estimator of qubit
states, which utilizes weak measurements and Bayesian optimization to find the
optimal control pulses for gate design. Our numerical results demonstrate a
significant reduction in the calibration process, obtaining a high gate
fidelity. Using the proposed estimator we estimated the qubit state with and
without measurement noise and the estimation error between the qubit state and
the estimator state is less than 0.02. With this setup, we drive an
approximated pi pulse with final fidelity of 0.9928. This shows that our
proposed strategy is robust against the presence of measurement and
environmental noise and can also be applicable for the calibration of many
other quantum computation technologies.

framework for risk monotonization based on cross-validation that takes as input
a generic prediction procedure and returns a modified procedure whose
out-of-sample prediction risk is, asymptotically, monotonic in the limiting

including forecasting tasks using electronic health records, where different
patients form a cross-section. We focus on the task of constructing valid
prediction intervals (PIs) in time series regression with a cross-section. A
prediction interval is considered valid if it covers the true response with (a
pre-specified) high probability. We first distinguish between two notions of
validity in such a setting: cross-sectional and longitudinal. Cross-sectional
validity is concerned with validity across the cross-section of the time series
data, while longitudinal validity accounts for the temporal dimension. Coverage
guarantees along both these dimensions are ideally desirable; however, we show
that distribution-free longitudinal validity is theoretically impossible.
Despite this limitation, we propose Conformal Prediction with Temporal
Dependence (CPTD), a procedure that is able to maintain strict cross-sectional
validity while improving longitudinal coverage. CPTD is post-hoc and
light-weight, and can easily be used in conjunction with any prediction model
as long as a calibration set is available. We focus on neural networks due to
their ability to model complicated data such as diagnosis codes for time series
regression, and perform extensive experimental validation to verify the
efficacy of our approach. We find that CPTD outperforms baselines on a variety
of datasets by improving longitudinal coverage and often providing more
efficient (narrower) PIs.

how different constructive algorithms whose behaviour only depends on

reduced dimensions, where the global optimum of the problems is known, giving
different weights to the NP-hard component, while the weight of the P component

have many applications but remain generally intractable when the number of

the number of players to grow to infinity. Traditional methods for solving
these games generally rely on solving partial or stochastic differential
equations with a full knowledge of the model. Recently, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has appeared promising to solve complex problems. By combining MFGs and
RL, we hope to solve games at a very large scale both in terms of population
size and environment complexity. In this survey, we review the quickly growing
recent literature on RL methods to learn Nash equilibria in MFGs. We first
identify the most common settings (static, stationary, and evolutive). We then
present a general framework for classical iterative methods (based on
best-response computation or policy evaluation) to solve MFGs in an exact way.
Building on these algorithms and the connection with Markov Decision Processes,
we explain how RL can be used to learn MFG solutions in a model-free way. Last,

A matched sample of 132 unabsorbed quasars was analyzed in parallel. The
emission lines showed the well known anticorrelation between the [OIII] and
FeII emission (Boroson & Green 1992). Using a summary statistic called E1 to
quantify this anticorrelation, we found that while the distribution of E1 for
the unabsorbed quasars has a single peak, the FeLoBALQs have a bimodal shape in
this parameter. Previous studies have shown that the line emission properties
of BAL and non-BAL quasars are consistent, and therefore the difference in the
Hbeta region emission between FeLoBAL quasars and unabsorbed quasars is a new
result. The two populations of FeLoBAL quasars are characterized by low and
high bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios. Some previous studies have
suggested that BAL quasars are high accretion-rate objects, and therefore the
discovery of the low accretion-rate branch of FeLoBAL quasars was unexpected.
We also found that the Hbeta FWHM is systematically broader among the FeLoBALQs
compared with the non-BAL quasars implying a higher inclination viewing angle
or a dearth of low-velocity line-emitting gas.

matter decay or annihilation into Standard Model particles, and secret neutrino
interactions with dark matter. Neutrinos could be produced in the decay or
annihilation of galactic or extragalactic dark matter. Additionally, if an
interaction between dark matter and neutrinos exists then dark matter will
interact with extragalactic neutrinos. In particular galactic dark matter will
induce an anisotropy in the neutrino sky if this interaction is present. We use
seven and a half years of the High-Energy Starting Event (HESE) sample data,
which measures neutrinos in the energy range of approximately 60 TeV to 10 PeV,
to study these phenomena. This all-sky event selection is dominated by
extragalactic neutrinos. For dark matter of $\sim$ 1 PeV in mass, we constrain
the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section to be smaller than
$10^{-23}$cm$^3$/s for the exclusive $\mu^+\mu^-$ channel and $10^{-22}$
cm$^3$/s for the $b\bar b$ channel. For the same mass, we constrain the
lifetime of dark matter to be larger than $10^{28}$ s for all channels studied,
except for decaying exclusively to $b\bar b$ where it is bounded to be larger
than $10^{27}$ s. Finally, we also search for evidence of astrophysical
neutrinos scattering on galactic dark matter in two scenarios. For fermionic
dark matter with a vector mediator, we constrain the dimensionless coupling
associated with this interaction to be less than 0.1 for dark matter mass of
0.1 GeV and a mediator mass of $10^{-4}~$ GeV. In the case of scalar dark
matter with a fermionic mediator, we constrain the coupling to be less than 0.1

superconducting phase of H$_x$TiSe$_2$ is possibly gapless-like and multi-band

gating and copper or lithium intercalation. The uniqueness of hydrogen doping
is supported by ab initio calculations showing that its impact is not limited
to a rigid electron doping of pristine TiSe$_2$, but it can attain a full

polarised surfaces and also in the setting of framed sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$.
The proof is based on the blow-up algorithm of Nakajima-Yoshioka for framed
sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, which has recently been extend to the setting of
Gieseker $H$-stable sheaves on $H$-polarised surfaces by Kuhn-Tanaka.

novel and general-purpose Inception Transformer, or iFormer for short, that
effectively learns comprehensive features with both high- and low-frequency

explicitly graft the advantages of convolution and max-pooling for capturing
the high-frequency information to Transformers. Different from recent hybrid
frameworks, the Inception mixer brings greater efficiency through a channel
splitting mechanism to adopt parallel convolution/max-pooling path and
self-attention path as high- and low-frequency mixers, while having the
flexibility to model discriminative information scattered within a wide
frequency range. Considering that bottom layers play more roles in capturing
high-frequency details while top layers more in modeling low-frequency global
information, we further introduce a frequency ramp structure, i.e. gradually
decreasing the dimensions fed to the high-frequency mixer and increasing those
to the low-frequency mixer, which can effectively trade-off high- and
low-frequency components across different layers. We benchmark the iFormer on a
series of vision tasks, and showcase that it achieves impressive performance on

complexity of simulating such systems as a function of evolution time. On one

sampling, becomes formally hard after an exponentially long evolution time,
assuming widely believed conjectures in complexity theory. Finally, using the
consequences of our classical simulation results, we also show that the quantum

We focus
on Euclidean wormholes that connect two asymptotically AdS or hyperbolic
regions with $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ boundary. There is no
solution to Einstein's equations of this sort, as the wormholes possess a
modulus that runs to infinity. To find on-shell wormholes we must stabilize
this modulus, which we can do by fixing the total energy on the two boundaries.
Such a wormhole gives the saddle point approximation to a non-standard problem
in quantum gravity, where we fix two asymptotic boundaries and constrain the
common energy. Crucially the dual quantity does not factorize even when the
bulk is dual to a single CFT, on account of the fixed energy constraint. From
this quantity we extract a smeared version of the microcanonical spectral form
factor. For a chaotic theory this quantity is self-averaging, i.e.
well-approximated by averaging over energy windows, or over coupling constants.
  We go on to give a precision test involving the microcanonical spectral form
factor where the two replicas have slightly different coupling constants. In
chaotic theories this form factor is known to smoothly decay at a rate
universally predicted in terms of one replica physics, provided that there is
an average either over a window or over couplings. We compute the expected
decay rate for holographic theories, and the form factor from a wormhole, and
the two exactly agree for a wide range of two-derivative effective field
theories in AdS. This gives a precision test of averaging in AdS/CFT.
  Our results interpret a number of confusing facts about wormholes and
factorization in AdS and suggest that we should regard gravitational effective
field theory as a mesoscopic description, analogous to semiclassical mesoscopic
descriptions of quantum chaotic systems.

factor of ${\rm tr}(F^3)$. Our proof is based on a recently developed bootstrap
method using the representation of master integral expansions, together with
some unitarity cuts that are universal in general gauge theories. The maximally
transcendental parts of the two-loop four-gluon form factor of
$\mathrm{tr}(F^3)$ are obtained for the first time in both planar
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and pure YM theories. This form factor can be understood as
the Higgs-plus-four-gluon amplitudes involving a dimension-seven operator in
the Higgs effective theory. In this case, we find that the maximally
transcendental part of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM result is different from that of
pure YM, and the discrepancy is due to the gluino-loop contributions in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In contrast, the scalar-loop contributions have no
maximally transcendental parts. Thus, the maximal transcendentality principle
still holds for the form factor results in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and QCD, after a
proper identification of the fundamental quarks and adjoint gluinos as $n_f
\rightarrow 4N_c$. This seems to be the first example of the maximally
transcendental principle that involves fermion-loop contributions. As another
intriguing observation, we find that the four-point form factor of the half-BPS
$\mathrm{tr}(\phi^3)$ operator is precisely a building block in the form factor
of $\mathrm{tr}(F^3)$.

excellent agreement between these numerically exact results and the quantum

scenarios which have been recently studied with ultracold atom experiments.
First, in the presence of a tilt, the quantum Boltzmann equation predicts that
transport is significantly slowed down and becomes subdiffusive, consistent
with previous studies. Second, we study transport probed by displacing a

which scaling laws as a function of stellar mass are known. We aim to test
whether the observed population of planets around low-mass stars can be
explained by these trends, or if separate formation channels are needed.
  We address this question by confronting a state-of-the-art planet population
synthesis model with a sample of planets around M dwarfs observed by the HARPS
and CARMENES radial velocity (RV) surveys. To account for detection biases, we
performed injection and retrieval experiments on the actual RV data to produce
synthetic observations of planets that we simulated following the core
accretion paradigm.
  These simulations robustly yield the previously reported high occurrence of
rocky planets around M dwarfs and generally agree with their planetary mass
function. In contrast, our simulations cannot reproduce a population of giant
planets around stars less massive than 0.5 solar masses. This potentially
indicates an alternative formation channel for giant planets around the least
massive stars that cannot be explained with current core accretion theories. We
further find a stellar mass dependency in the detection rate of short-period
planets. A lack of close-in planets around the earlier-type stars ($M_\star
\gtrsim 0.4\, M_\odot$) in our sample remains unexplained by our model and
indicates dissimilar planet migration barriers in disks of different spectral
subtypes.
  Both discrepancies can be attributed to gaps in our understanding of planet
migration in nascent M dwarf systems. They underline the different conditions
around young stars of different spectral subtypes, and the importance of taking
these differences into account when studying planet formation.

with the distance from the galaxy centres and often reaching kpc scales. We
study the effects of gas disc flaring on the recovered dark matter halo

sample of 32 dwarf and spiral galaxies with high-quality neutral gas, molecular
gas, and stellar mass profiles, robust H\,{\sc i} rotation curves obtained via
3D kinematic modelling, and reliable bulge-disc decomposition. By assuming

gas-dominated dwarfs, while for most of the galaxies the effect is minor and
can be ignored. We revisit the stellar- and baryon-to-halo mass relations
($M_\ast-M_{200}$ and $M_{\rm bar}-M_{200}$). Both relations increase smoothly
up to $M_{200} \approx 10^{12}~\rm{ M_\odot}$, with galaxies at this end having
high $M_\ast/M_{200}$ and $M_{\rm bar}/M_{200}$ ratios approaching the
cosmological baryon fraction. At higher $M_{200}$ the relations show a larger
scatter. Most haloes of our galaxy sample closely follow the concentration-mass
($c_{200}-M_{\rm 200}$) relation resulting from N-body cosmological
simulations. Interestingly, the galaxies deviating above and below the relation
have the highest and lowest stellar and baryon factions, respectively, which
suggests that the departures from the $c_{200}-M_{\rm 200}$ law are regulated

widely used in many natural language processing scenarios, like reranking,
which is to select the best sentence from multiple candidates. Previous works
on sentence scoring mainly adopted either causal language modeling (CLM) like
GPT or masked language modeling (MLM) like BERT, which have some limitations:
1) CLM only utilizes unidirectional information for the probability estimation
of a sentence without considering bidirectional context, which affects the
scoring quality; 2) MLM can only estimate the probability of partial tokens at
a time and thus requires multiple forward passes to estimate the probability of
the whole sentence, which incurs large computation and time cost. In this
paper, we propose \textit{Transcormer} -- a Transformer model with a novel
\textit{sliding language modeling} (SLM) for sentence scoring. Specifically,
our SLM adopts a triple-stream self-attention mechanism to estimate the
probability of all tokens in a sentence with bidirectional context and only
requires a single forward pass. SLM can avoid the limitations of CLM (only
unidirectional context) and MLM (multiple forward passes) and inherit their
advantages, and thus achieve high effectiveness and efficiency in scoring.
Experimental results on multiple tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
better performance than other language modelings.

general relativistic predictions for black-hole spacetimes in the strong-field
regime. One of the key ingredients for several tests is a metric that allows
for deviations from the Kerr solution but remains free of pathologies outside
its event horizon. Existing metrics that have been used in the literature often
do not satisfy the null convergence condition that is necessary to apply the
strong rigidity theorem and would have allowed us to calculate the location of
the event horizon by identifying it with an appropriate Killing horizon. This
has led earlier calculations of event horizons of parametrically deformed
metrics to either follow numerical techniques or simply search heuristically
for coordinate singularities. We show that several of these metrics, almost by
construction, are circular. We can, therefore, use the weak rigidity and
Carter's rotosurface theorem and calculate algebraically the locations of their
event horizons, without relying on expansions or numerical techniques. We apply
this approach to a number of parametrically deformed metrics, calculate the
locations of their event horizons, and place constraints on the deviation
parameters such that the metrics remain regular outside their horizons. We show
that calculating the angular velocity of the horizon and the effective gravity
there offers new insights into the observational signatures of deformed
metrics, such as the sizes and shapes of the predicted black-hole shadows.

signal-to-noise ~100 from 2200 passive central galaxies (z~0.05) to understand
how central galaxy assembly depends on stellar mass (M*) and halo mass (Mh). We
control for systematic errors in Mh by employing a new group catalog from
Tinker (2020a,b) and the widely-used Yang et al. (2007) catalog. At fixed M*,
the strength of several stellar absorption features varies systematically with
Mh. Completely model-free, this is one of the first indications that the
stellar populations of centrals with identical M* are affected by the
properties of their host halos. To interpret these variations, we applied full
spectral fitting with the code alf. At fixed M*, centrals in more massive halos
are older, show lower [Fe/H], and have higher [Mg/Fe] with 3.5 sigma
confidence. We conclude that halos not only dictate how much M* galaxies
assemble, but also modulate their chemical enrichment histories. Turning to our
analysis at fixed Mh, high-M* centrals are older, show lower [Fe/H], and have
higher [Mg/Fe] for Mh>10^{12}Msun/h with confidence > 4 sigma. While massive
passive galaxies are thought to form early and rapidly, our results are among
the first to distinguish these trends at fixed Mh. They suggest that high-M*
centrals experienced unique early formation histories, either through enhanced
collapse and gas fueling, or because their halos were early-forming and highly
concentrated, a possible signal of galaxy assembly bias.

human motions into three aspects, namely interaction diversity (e.g. sitting on
different objects with different poses in the given scenes), path diversity
(e.g. moving to the target locations following different paths), and the motion
diversity (e.g. having various body movements during moving). Based on this
factorized scheme, a hierarchical framework is proposed, with each sub-module
responsible for modeling one aspect. We assess the effectiveness of our
framework on two challenging datasets for scene-aware human motion synthesis.
The experiment results show that the proposed framework remarkably outperforms

$10^{-11} \rm M_{\odot}$), which might constitute all the dark matter, can be
captured by stars when they traverse them at low enough velocity. After being
placed on a bound orbit during star formation, they can repeatedly cross the
star if the orbit happens to be highly eccentric, slow down by dynamical
friction and end up in the stellar core. The rate of these captures is highest
in halos of high dark matter density and low velocity dispersion, when the
first stars form at redshift $z \sim 20$. We compute this capture rate for
low-metallicity stars of $0.3$ to $1\rm M_{\odot}$, and find that a high
fraction of these stars formed in the first dwarf galaxies would capture a
primordial black hole, which would then grow by accretion up to a mass that may
be close to the total star mass. We show the capture rate of primordial black
holes does not depend on their mass over this asteroid-mass window, and should
not be much affected by external tidal perturbations. These low-mass stellar
black holes could be discovered today in low-metallicity, old binary systems in
the Milky Way containing a surviving low-mass main-sequence star or a white
dwarf, or via gravitational waves emitted in a merger with another compact
object. No mechanisms in standard stellar evolution theory are known to form
black holes of less than a Chandrasekhar mass, so detecting a low-mass black
hole would fundamentally impact our understanding of stellar evolution, dark
matter and the early Universe.

black holes in this theory have a minimum mass which separates a stable branch

coexist. We perform extensive nonlinear simulations of the spherical collapse

is important. There are two major types of XAI for time series data, namely
model-agnostic and model-specific. Model-specific approach is considered in
this work. While other approaches employ either Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
or Attention Mechanism, we merge the two strategies into a single system,
simply called the Temporally Weighted Spatiotemporal Explainable Neural Network
for Multivariate Time Series (TSEM). TSEM combines the capabilities of RNN and
CNN models in such a way that RNN hidden units are employed as attention
weights for the CNN feature maps temporal axis. The result shows that TSEM
outperforms XCM. It is similar to STAM in terms of accuracy, while also
satisfying a number of interpretability criteria, including causality,

relative depletion pattern, for which values are published in previous works.
The present study uses these parameters to calculate post-depleted gas-phase
abundances of 15 different elements while varying $F_*$ from 0 to 1. An
analysis of emergent strong spectral line intensities, obtained by inputting
the calculated abundances into a cloudy model, shows that the depletion
strength has a non-trivial effect on predicted emission lines and the thermal
balance of the ionized cloud. The amount by which elements deplete also affects
the coolant abundances in the gas. Furthermore, it was found that each of the
parameters - metallicity, ionization parameter U and depletion strength $F_*$
have degenerate effects on the emission-line strengths, and thermal balance of
the interstellar medium (ISM). Finally, comparing our results to a sample of H
II regions using data obtained from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
Observatory survey (MaNGA) revealed that the best-fit $F_*$ was approximately
0.5. However, this best-fit value does not work well for all metallicities.
Removing the sulfur depletion and changing the nitrogen abundance pattern can
improve the fit. As a result, extra observational evidence is required to
verify the choices of parameters and better constrain the typical depletion
strength in galaxies.

similar model of preference dynamics, where an individual's preferences move
towards content the consume and enjoy, and away from content they consume and

achieve approximate stationarity, under mild conditions on the set of available

different neural network architectures, and tune hyper-parameters for optimal

the architecture and hyper-parameter space for optimal neural networks.
However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods do not include traditional

correction, because the degree of extinction is usually determined by comparing
the observed spectra of the target sources with their theoretically predicted

correction and plasma diagnostics together by iteratively seeking a converged

converged solution can be found based solely on well-calibrated line
intensities, given the adopted extinction law and the R_V value. However, it is
still rare to find these analyses done numerically rigorously from start to

higher explainability score on gradient-based attribution methods (but not

highly accurate more than both vanilla and robust models alone, are not
superior in explainability. Third, among 9 feature attribution methods tested,

interestingly suggests that CNNs are harder to interpret as they become more

charged ions or neutral atoms. Here we present the first realisation of this
new class of clocks, based on an optical magnetic-dipole transition in
Ar$^{13+}$. Its comprehensively evaluated systematic frequency uncertainty of
$2.2\times10^{-17}$ is comparable to that of many optical clocks in operation.
From clock comparisons we improve by eight and nine orders of magnitude upon
the uncertainties for the absolute transition frequency and isotope shift
($^{40}$Ar vs. $^{36}$Ar), respectively. These measurements allow us to probe
the largely unexplored quantum electrodynamic nuclear recoil, presented as part

centralizing data. However, the traditional FL framework is cloud-based and
suffers from high communication latency. On the other hand, the edge-based FL

model aggregation has low communication latency but suffers from degraded model

but high-latency cloud-based FL and low-latency but low-accuracy edge-based FL,
this paper proposes a new FL framework based on cooperative mobile edge
networking called cooperative federated edge learning (CFEL) to enable both
high-accuracy and low-latency distributed intelligence at mobile edge networks.
Considering the unique two-tier network architecture of CFEL, a novel federated
optimization method dubbed cooperative edge-based federated averaging
(CE-FedAvg) is further developed, wherein each edge server both coordinates
collaborative model training among the devices within its own coverage and
cooperates with other edge servers to learn a shared global model through
decentralized consensus. Experimental results based on benchmark datasets show
that CFEL can largely reduce the training time to achieve a target model
accuracy compared with prior FL frameworks.

causes fall in future sales and demands. Retailers are employing several
approaches to detect empty shelves and ensure high OSA of products; however,
such methods are generally ineffective and infeasible since they are either
manual, expensive or less accurate. Recently machine learning based solutions
have been proposed, but they suffer from high computational cost and low

Here, we present an elegant approach for designing an end-to-end machine

generated by varying a set of parameters obtained from a low-dimensional latent
space. Deep generative models (DGMs) are widely used to learn data
representations in an unsupervised way. DGMs parameterize the underlying
low-dimensional manifold in the data space using bottleneck architectures such
as variational autoencoders (VAEs). The bottleneck dimension for VAEs is
treated as a hyperparameter that depends on the dataset and is fixed at design
time after extensive tuning. As the intrinsic dimensionality of most real-world
datasets is unknown, often, there is a mismatch between the intrinsic
dimensionality and the latent dimensionality chosen as a hyperparameter. This
mismatch can negatively contribute to the model performance for representation
learning and sample generation tasks. This paper proposes relevance encoding
networks (RENs): a novel probabilistic VAE-based framework that uses the
automatic relevance determination (ARD) prior in the latent space to learn the
data-specific bottleneck dimensionality. The relevance of each latent dimension
is directly learned from the data along with the other model parameters using
stochastic gradient descent and a reparameterization trick adapted to
non-Gaussian priors. We leverage the concept of DeepSets to capture permutation
invariant statistical properties in both data and latent spaces for relevance
determination. The proposed framework is general and flexible and can be used
for the state-of-the-art VAE models that leverage regularizers to impose
specific characteristics in the latent space (e.g., disentanglement). With
extensive experimentation on synthetic and public image datasets, we show that
the proposed model learns the relevant latent bottleneck dimensionality without
compromising the representation and generation quality of the samples.

under-addressed challenges on existing methods in semi-supervised learning,
continuous learning, and domain adaptation: 1) robust pseudo-labeling under
gradual shifts and 2) anti-forgetting adaptation with short lookback. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a principled and generic generation-replay

varieties with extra structure, i.e., the structure of a motive. The problem of
similarly enriching the topological fundamental group has a long history. For
example, Hain proved in [arXiv:alg-geom/9607019] that, given a variation of
Hodge structures satisfying certain assumptions, the Malcev completion of the
fundamental group relative the associated monodromy representation carries a
canonical mixed Hodge structure. Our main result is a motivic version of Hain's
theorem. More precisely, given a ""motivic local system"" (on the generic point
of a smooth variety in characteristic zero) we show that the Malcev completion
of the fundamental group relative the associated monodromy representation is
canonically a (Nori) motive.
  In fact, we prove something stronger, namely that the homomorphism from the
topological fundamental group to the motivic fundamental group is Malcev
complete, i.e., isomorphic to its Malcev completion. Our main tool is an
abstract criterion for homomorphisms of affine group schemes to be Malcev
complete, and most of our work goes into proving this result. We also show how
this criterion gives a new proof of the main theorem of [arXiv:2009.14170],
i.e., that the homomorphism from the topological fundamental group to the Hodge
fundamental group is Malcev complete, and how to deduce from this a
strengthening of Hain's theorem, valid for arbitrary admissible variations of

(e.g., rotation angles) which provide the ability to perform a continuous range
of operations. Verification of the correct operation of these gates across the
allowable range of parameters is important for gaining confidence in the
reliability of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate a procedure for
sample-efficient verification of continuously-parameterized quantum gates for
small quantum processors of up to approximately 10 qubits. This procedure
involves generating random sequences of randomly-parameterized layers of gates
chosen from the native gate set of the device, and then stochastically
compiling an approximate inverse to this sequence such that executing the full
sequence on the device should leave the system near its initial state. We show
that fidelity estimates made via this technique have a lower variance than
fidelity estimates made via cross-entropy benchmarking. This provides an
experimentally-relevant advantage in sample efficiency when estimating the
fidelity loss to some desired precision. We describe the experimental
realization of this technique using continuously-parameterized quantum gate

sequential iterative algorithms can be directly parallelized but there are
still challenges in achieving work-efficiency and high-parallelism.
Work-efficiency can be hard for certain problems where the number of
dependences is asymptotically more than optimal sequential work bound. To
achieve high-parallelism, we want to process as many objects as possible in
parallel. The goal is to achieve $\tilde{O}(D)$ span for a problem with the
deepest dependence length $D$. We refer to this property as round-efficiency.
In this paper, we show work-efficient and round-efficient algorithms for a
variety of classic problems and propose general approaches to do so.
  To efficiently parallelize many sequential iterative algorithms, we propose
the phase-parallel framework. The framework assigns a rank to each object and
processes them accordingly. All objects with the same rank can be processed in
parallel. To enable work-efficiency and high parallelism, we use two types of
general techniques. Type 1 algorithms aim to use range queries to extract all
objects with the same rank, such that we avoid evaluating all the dependences.
We discuss activity selection, unlimited knapsack, and more using Type 1
framework. Type 2 algorithms aim to wake up an object when the last object it
depends on is finished. We discuss activity selection, longest increasing
subsequence (LIS), and many other algorithms using Type 2 framework.
  All of our algorithms are (nearly) work-efficient and round-efficient. Many
of them improve previous best bounds, and some of them are the first to achieve
work-efficiency with round-efficiency. We also implement many of them. On
inputs with reasonable dependence depth, our algorithms are highly parallelized
and significantly outperform their sequential counterparts.

Specifically, we utilise existing orbit-based dynamical models, which
re-produce the measured stellar kinematics, in order to fit the new IMF maps
within this orbital framework. We then investigate correlations between
intrinsic orbital properties and the local IMF. We find that, within each
galaxy, the high-angular-momentum, disk-like stars exhibit an IMF which is rich
in dwarf stars. The centrally-concentrated pressure-supported orbits have IMF
which are similarly rich in dwarf stars. Conversely, orbits at large radius
which have intermediate angular momentum exhibit IMF which are markedly less
dwarf-rich relative to the other regions of the same galaxy. Assuming that the
stars which, in the present-day, reside on dynamically-hot orbits at large
radii are dominated by accreted populations, we can interpret these findings as
a correlation between the dwarf-richness of a population of stars, and the mass
of the host in which it formed. Specifically, deeper gravitational potentials
would produce more dwarf-rich populations, resulting in the relative deficiency
of dwarf stars which originated in the lower-mass accreted satellites.
Conversely, the central and high angular-momentum populations are likely
dominated by in-situ stars, which were formed in the more massive host itself.
There are also global differences between the three galaxies studied here, of
up to $\sim 0.3\ \mathrm{dex}$ in the IMF parameter $\xi$. We find no local
dynamical or chemical property which alone can fully account for the IMF
variations.

as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both
older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators found among both
the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of
M star rotation rates. About 13% of the stars have an infrared (IR) excess,
suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well-matched to expectations, given
the age of the stars. There is an obvious pile-up of disked M stars at P~2
days, and the pile-up may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is
also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P~2 days, hinting that
perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring

to the incidence of many diseases with age. A state-of-the-art approach for
this purpose infers a weighted dynamic aging-specific subnetwork by mapping
gene expression (GE) levels at different ages onto the protein-protein
interaction network (PPIN). Then, it analyzes this subnetwork in a supervised
manner by training a predictive model to learn how network topologies of known
aging- vs. non-aging-related genes change across ages. Finally, it uses the
trained model to predict novel aging-related genes. However, the best current
subnetwork resulting from this approach still yields suboptimal prediction
accuracy. This could be because it was inferred using outdated GE and PPIN
data. Here, we evaluate whether analyzing a weighted dynamic aging-specific
subnetwork inferred from newer GE and PPIN data improves prediction accuracy
upon analyzing the best current subnetwork inferred from outdated data.
Unexpectedly, we find that not to be the case. To understand this, we perform
aging-related pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses. We find
that the suboptimal prediction accuracy, regardless of which GE or PPIN data is
used, may be caused by the current knowledge about which genes are
aging-related being incomplete, or by the current methods for inferring or
analyzing an aging-specific subnetwork being unable to capture all of the
aging-related knowledge. These findings can potentially guide future directions
towards improving supervised prediction of aging-related genes via -omics data

properties depend not only on the details of the unit cell but also on how unit
cells are arranged and interact with each other. In conventional engineering
structures, each unit cell interacts with adjacent cells. Methods developed for
vibrational and wave propagation analysis in periodic engineering structures
consider only nearest-neighbor interactions. The dispersion curves of such
systems, in which only adjacent cells interact, have been extensively studied.
Metamaterial properties depend on the interactions of a unit cell with other
cells. Further interactions, and specifically, interactions beyond the closest
neighbors, imply a more complex band structure and wave behavior. In this
paper, an example class of such structures, in which electrostatic forces are
the driving force, has been investigated. In this paper, properties affecting
these periodic structures, such as elastic forces, have been investigated. An
interesting property of such structures is that the band structures of such
metamaterials can be tuned by changing electric voltages.

  Image Recognition with Partial Labels","Technical Report. arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:2203.02172",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite achieving impressive progress, current multi-label image recognition
(MLR) algorithms heavily depend on large-scale datasets with complete labels,
making collecting large-scale datasets extremely time-consuming and
labor-intensive. Training the multi-label image recognition models with partial
labels (MLR-PL) is an alternative way, in which merely some labels are known
while others are unknown for each image. However, current MLP-PL algorithms
rely on pre-trained image similarity models or iteratively updating the image
classification models to generate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. Thus,
they depend on a certain amount of annotations and inevitably suffer from
obvious performance drops, especially when the known label proportion is low.
To address this dilemma, we propose a dual-perspective semantic-aware
representation blending (DSRB) that blends multi-granularity category-specific
semantic representation across different images, from instance and prototype
perspective respectively, to transfer information of known labels to complement
unknown labels. Specifically, an instance-perspective representation blending
(IPRB) module is designed to blend the representations of the known labels in
an image with the representations of the corresponding unknown labels in
another image to complement these unknown labels. Meanwhile, a
prototype-perspective representation blending (PPRB) module is introduced to
learn more stable representation prototypes for each category and blends the
representation of unknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels,
in a location-sensitive manner, to complement these unknown labels. Extensive
experiments on the MS-COCO, Visual Genome, and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets show
that the proposed DSRB consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art
algorithms on all known label proportion settings.

shift, the simple baseline of training on an $\textit{undersampled}$ balanced
dataset often achieves close to state-of-the-art-accuracy across several
popular benchmarks. This is rather surprising, since undersampling algorithms
discard excess majority group data. To understand this phenomenon, we ask if
learning is fundamentally constrained by a lack of minority group samples. We
prove that this is indeed the case in the setting of nonparametric binary
classification. Our results show that in the worst case, an algorithm cannot
outperform undersampling unless there is a high degree of overlap between the
train and test distributions (which is unlikely to be the case in real-world
datasets), or if the algorithm leverages additional structure about the
distribution shift. In particular, in the case of label shift we show that
there is always an undersampling algorithm that is minimax optimal. In the case
of group-covariate shift we show that there is an undersampling algorithm that
is minimax optimal when the overlap between the group distributions is small.
We also perform an experimental case study on a label shift dataset and find
that in line with our theory, the test accuracy of robust neural network
classifiers is constrained by the number of minority samples.

take full advantage of the solutions generated in the head of training where

due to the imperfect wireless channel, these distortion metrics lose

models that often utilize only one type of interaction for recommendation. In
real scenarios, users often take a sequence of actions to interact with an
item, in order to get more information about the item and thus accurately
evaluate whether an item fits personal preference. Those interaction behaviors
often obey a certain order, and different behaviors reveal different
information or aspects of user preferences towards the target item. Most
existing multi-behavior recommendation methods take the strategy to first
extract information from different behaviors separately and then fuse them for
final prediction. However, they have not exploited the connections between
different behaviors to learn user preferences. Besides, they often introduce
complex model structures and more parameters to model multiple behaviors,
largely increasing the space and time complexity. In this work, we propose a

source-channel coding methods to achieve end-to-end video transmission over
wireless channels. The proposed methods exploit nonlinear transform and
conditional coding architecture to adaptively extract semantic features across
video frames, and transmit semantic feature domain representations over
wireless channels via deep joint source-channel coding. Our framework is
collected under the name deep video semantic transmission (DVST). In
particular, benefiting from the strong temporal prior provided by the feature
domain context, the learned nonlinear transform function becomes temporally
adaptive, resulting in a richer and more accurate entropy model guiding the
transmission of current frame. Accordingly, a novel rate adaptive transmission
mechanism is developed to customize deep joint source-channel coding for video
sources. It learns to allocate the limited channel bandwidth within and among
video frames to maximize the overall transmission performance. The whole DVST
design is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
end-to-end transmission rate-distortion performance under perceptual quality
metrics or machine vision task performance metrics. Across standard video
source test sequences and various communication scenarios, experiments show
that our DVST can generally surpass traditional wireless video coded
transmission schemes. The proposed DVST framework can well support future
semantic communications due to its video content-aware and machine vision task
integration abilities.

large-scale underground environments requires high-precision localization and
mapping. This crucial requirement is faced with many challenges in complex and
perceptually-degraded subterranean environments, as the onboard perception
system is required to operate in off-nominal conditions (poor visibility due to
darkness and dust, rugged and muddy terrain, and the presence of self-similar
and ambiguous scenes). In a disaster response scenario and in the absence of
prior information about the environment, robots must rely on noisy sensor data
and perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to build a 3D map of
the environment and localize themselves and potential survivors. To that end,
this paper reports on a multi-robot SLAM system developed by team CoSTAR in the
context of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. We extend our previous work, LAMP,
by incorporating a single-robot front-end interface that is adaptable to
different odometry sources and lidar configurations, a scalable multi-robot
front-end to support inter- and intra-robot loop closure detection for large
scale environments and multi-robot teams, and a robust back-end equipped with
an outlier-resilient pose graph optimization based on Graduated Non-Convexity.
We provide a detailed ablation study on the multi-robot front-end and back-end,

collected across mines, power plants, and caves in the United States. We also
release our multi-robot back-end datasets (and the corresponding ground truth),
which can serve as challenging benchmarks for large-scale underground SLAM.

mid-infrared W1 ($3.4\mu$m) and W2 ($4.6\mu$m) bands, using large samples 848
galaxies and 857 galaxies in the W1 and W2 bands respectively. In this
calibration we performed a correction for the cluster population incompleteness
bias, and a morphological type correction. The calibration was performed using
a new, iterative bivariate fitting procedure. For these calibrations we used
the total absolute magnitudes, and HI linewidths $W_{F50}$ derived from the HI
global profiles as a measure of the rotational velocities. We then performed
two additional calibrations on the same sample using (i) the isophotal
magnitudes and (ii) the average rotational velocities measured along the flat
sections of the spatially resolved rotation curves of the galaxies, which were
obtained from the empirical conversion between rotational velocity definitions.
We compared these three calibrations to determine whether the use of isophotal
magnitudes, or spatially resolved rotational velocities have a significant
impact on the scatter around the TF relations in the W1 and W2 bands. We found
that the original calibrations using total magnitudes and \hi linewidths had
the smallest total scatters. These calibrations are given by $M_{\rm Tot, W1} =
(2.02 \pm 0.44) - (10.08 \pm 0.17)\log_{10}(W_{F50})$ and $M_{\rm Tot, W2} =

scatters of $\sigma_{W1} = 0.68$ and $\sigma_{W2} = 0.69$. Finally, we compared
our calibrations in the mid-infrared bands with previous calibrations in the
near-infrared J, H and K bands and the long-wavelength optical I band, which
used the same two corrections. The differences between these relations can be
explained by considering the different regions and components of spiral
galaxies that are traced by the different wavelengths.

efficient pretraining method that is applicable to various hierarchical Vision
Transformers. Existing masked image modeling (MIM) methods for hierarchical
Vision Transformers replace a random subset of input tokens with a special
[MASK] symbol and aim at reconstructing original image tokens from the
corrupted image. However, we find that using the [MASK] symbol greatly slows
down the training and causes pretraining-finetuning inconsistency, due to the
large masking ratio (e.g., 60% in SimMIM). On the other hand, MAE does not
introduce [MASK] tokens at its encoder at all but is not applicable for
hierarchical Vision Transformers. To solve the issue and accelerate the
pretraining of hierarchical models, we replace the masked tokens of one image
with visible tokens of another image, i.e., creating a mixed image. We then
conduct dual reconstruction to reconstruct the two original images from the
mixed input, which significantly improves efficiency. While MixMAE can be
applied to various hierarchical Transformers, this paper explores using Swin
Transformer with a large window size and scales up to huge model size (to reach
600M parameters). Empirical results demonstrate that MixMAE can learn
high-quality visual representations efficiently. Notably, MixMAE with
Swin-B/W14 achieves 85.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K by pretraining for 600
epochs. Besides, its transfer performances on the other 6 datasets show that
MixMAE has better FLOPs / performance tradeoff than previous popular MIM
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Sense-X/MixMIM.

aims to send 1 gram of payload at 0.2 c. The present work widens the mission
design space to 0.1 mg to 100 kt payload and 0.0001-0.99 c cruise velocity.
Drawing up to 5 GW directly from the grid (to augment power drawn from local
energy storage) turns out to be the key to making small missions affordable: It
collapses the accelerating laser's capital cost by up to 5 orders of magnitude,
enabling new possibilities such as a 10 kg Solar system cubesat that
accelerates to 0.001 c (63 au/yr) using a 77 m sail and \$610M laser, costing
\$58M worth of energy per mission.
  Trajectory equations describing lightsail acceleration are derived in closed
form and used instead of numerical integration. Consequently, analyses have
progressed from single point designs to whole performance maps comprised of
thousands of cost-optimized point designs. The performance maps reveal
qualitatively different regimes characterized by the particular constraint that
drives cost, and these driving constraints change depending on mission payload
mass and cruise velocity.
  The performance maps also reveal a family of cost-optimal missions that
accelerate at Earth gravity: The heaviest such mission is a 7.4 km diameter 100
kt vessel (equivalent to 225 International Space Stations) that is accelerated
for 21 days to achieve 0.07 c, reaching the Centauri system within a human
lifetime. While unthinkable at this time, the required 380 PW peak radiated
power (twice terrestrial insolation) might be generated by space solar power or
fusion within a few centuries. Regardless, it is now possible to contemplate
such missions using laser-accelerated lightsails.

This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to
multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main
contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes
information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt
to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies
existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost
during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that
are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional
representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations
offer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at
the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale
retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for
long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original
representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale
datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet),
vision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT). MRL code and pretrained models
are open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MRL.

entities. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of VT URL scanning
reports containing the results of 95 scanners for 1.577 Billion URLs over two
years. Individual VT scanners are known to be noisy in terms of their detection
and attack type classification. To obtain high quality ground truth of URLs and
actively take proper actions to mitigate different types of attacks, there are
two challenges: (1) how to decide whether a given URL is malicious given noisy
reports and (2) how to determine attack types (e.g., phishing or malware
hosting) that the URL is involved in, given conflicting attack labels from
different scanners. In this work, we provide a systematic comparative study on
the behavior of VT scanners for different attack types of URLs. A common
practice to decide the maliciousness is to use a cut-off threshold of scanners
that report the URL as malicious. However, in this work, we show that using a
fixed threshold is suboptimal, due to several reasons: (1) correlations between
scanners; (2) lead/lag behavior; (3) the specialty of scanners; (4) the quality

to use majority voting. However, we show that majority voting could not
accurately classify the attack type of a URL due to the bias from correlated

shown extraordinarily promising for ensemble forecasting for their fast
inference speed compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP)

operational ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model. Previous
data-driven attempts achieve ensemble forecast using some simple perturbation
methods, like initial condition perturbation and Monte Carlo dropout. However,
they mostly suffer unsatisfactory ensemble performance, which is arguably
attributed to the sub-optimal ways of applying perturbation. We propose a Swin
Transformer-based Variational Recurrent Neural Network (SwinVRNN), which is a
stochastic weather forecasting model combining a SwinRNN predictor with a
perturbation module. SwinRNN is designed as a Swin Transformer-based recurrent
neural network, which predicts future states deterministically. Furthermore, to
model the stochasticity in prediction, we design a perturbation module
following the Variational Auto-Encoder paradigm to learn multivariate Gaussian
distributions of a time-variant stochastic latent variable from data. Ensemble
forecasting can be easily achieved by perturbing the model features leveraging
noise sampled from the learned distribution. We also compare four categories of
perturbation methods for ensemble forecasting, i.e. fixed distribution
perturbation, learned distribution perturbation, MC dropout, and multi model
ensemble. Comparisons on WeatherBench dataset show the learned distribution
perturbation method using our SwinVRNN model achieves superior forecast
accuracy and reasonable ensemble spread due to joint optimization of the two
targets. More notably, SwinVRNN surpasses operational IFS on surface variables

semantic hierarchy of ""Persian cat to cat to mammal"" encoded in an image
database for species. It is thus unknown whether an arbitrary image
self-supervised learning (SSL) approach can benefit from learning such

for Hierarchical Image Representation Learning (HIRL). This framework aims to
learn multiple semantic representations for each image, and these
representations are structured to encode image semantics from fine-grained to
coarse-grained. Based on a probabilistic factorization, HIRL learns the most
fine-grained semantics by an off-the-shelf image SSL approach and learns
multiple coarse-grained semantics by a novel semantic path discrimination
scheme. We adopt six representative image SSL methods as baselines and study

way to design tensor network embeddings consisting of Gaussian random tensors,
such that for inputs with more general tensor network structures, both the

  We analyze general tensor network embeddings that can be reduced to a
sequence of sketching matrices. We provide a sufficient condition to quantify
the accuracy of such embeddings and derive sketching asymptotic cost lower
bounds using embeddings that satisfy this condition and have a sketch size
lower than any input dimension. We then provide an algorithm to efficiently
sketch input data using such embeddings. The sketch size of the embedding used
in the algorithm has a linear dependence on the number of sketching dimensions
of the input. Assuming tensor contractions are performed with classical dense
matrix multiplication algorithms, this algorithm achieves asymptotic cost
within a factor of $O(\sqrt{m})$ of our cost lower bound, where $m$ is the
sketch size. Further, when each tensor in the input has a dimension that needs
to be sketched, this algorithm yields the optimal sketching asymptotic cost. We
apply our sketching analysis to inexact tensor decomposition optimization
algorithms. We provide a sketching algorithm for CP decomposition that is
asymptotically faster than existing work in multiple regimes, and show
optimality of an existing algorithm for tensor train rounding.

Specifically, the re-sampling module generates a new LF which is less polluted

list-decoding}). The list size is equal to the number of components in the
mixture, and the loss function is defined to be minimum among the losses
resulted by all the component models. We show that with this definition, a
solution of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) achieves small probability of
prediction error. This begs for an algorithm to minimize the empirical risk for
MLR, which is known to be computationally hard. Prior algorithmic works in MLR
focus on the {\em realizable} setting, i.e., recovery of parameters when data
is probabilistically generated by a mixed linear (noisy) model. In this paper
we show that a version of the popular alternating minimization (AM) algorithm
finds the best fit lines in a dataset even when a realizable model is not
assumed, under some regularity conditions on the dataset and the initial
points, and thereby provides a solution for the ERM. We further provide an
algorithm that runs in polynomial time in the number of datapoints, and
recovers a good approximation of the best fit lines. The two algorithms are
experimentally compared.

Josephson junction S/FI/S (S: $d$-wave superconductor, FI: ferromagnetic
insulator) on the surface of a topological insulator (TI). The simultaneous
existence of $\sin\varphi$, $\cos\varphi$ and $\sin 2\varphi$ terms with almost
the same order in Josephson current $I(\varphi)$ is essential to get larger
values of $Q$ factor given by $Q=(I_{c}^{+} - \mid I_{c}^{-} \mid)/ (I_{c}^{+}

one $I_{c}^{-}$ for macroscopic phase difference $\varphi$ of two
superconductors on TI. We find that it can show a very large diode effect by
tuning the crystal axes of $d$-wave superconductors and the magnetization of
FI. The difference of the maximum Josephson currents $I_{c}$'s between the
positive and negative directions can be about factor 2, where the current-phase
relation is modified largely from the conventional one. The relevance of the
zero energy Majorana bound states at the interface is also revealed. This

generation (NLG). However, it is still unclear how much commonsense knowledge

recent work has proposed the problem of generative commonsense reasoning, e.g.,
to compose a logical sentence given a set of unordered concepts. Existing
approaches to this problem hypothesize that PTMs lack sufficient parametric
knowledge for this task, which can be overcome by introducing external
knowledge or task-specific pre-training objectives. Different from this trend,
we argue that PTM's inherent ability for generative commonsense reasoning is
underestimated due to the order-agnostic property of its input. In particular,
we hypothesize that the order of the input concepts can affect the PTM's
ability to utilize its commonsense knowledge. To this end, we propose a
pre-ordering approach to elaborately manipulate the order of the given concepts

observational outcomes are taken to be finite bit strings induced by
measurement operators derived from a holographic screen bounding the system. In
this framework, measurements of identified systems with respect to defined
reference frames are represented by semantically-regulated information flows
through distributed systems of finite sets of binary-valued Barwise-Seligman
classifiers. Specifically, we construct a functor from the category of
cone-cocone diagrams (CCCDs) over finite sets of classifiers, to the category
of finite cobordisms of Hilbert spaces. We show that finite CCCDs provide a
generic representation of finite quantum reference frames (QRFs). Hence the
constructed functor shows how sequential finite measurements can induce TQFTs.
The only requirement is that each measurement in a sequence, by itself,
satisfies Bayesian coherence, hence that the probabilities it assigns satisfy
the Kolmogorov axioms. We extend the analysis so develop topological quantum
neural networks (TQNNs), which enable machine learning with functorial
evolution of quantum neural 2-complexes (TQN2Cs) governed by TQFTs amplitudes,
and resort to the Atiyah-Singer theorems in order to classify topological data
processed by TQN2Cs. We then comment about the quiver representation of CCCDs

TQFTs. We finally review potential implementations of this framework in solid

this task by summarizing each role's content separately and thus are prone to
ignore the information from other roles. However, we believe that other roles'

mentioned by other roles. Therefore, we propose a novel role interaction
enhanced method for role-oriented dialogue summarization. It adopts cross
attention and decoder self-attention interactions to interactively acquire
other roles' critical information. The cross attention interaction aims to
select other roles' critical dialogue utterances, while the decoder
self-attention interaction aims to obtain key information from other roles'
summaries. Experimental results have shown that our proposed method
significantly outperforms strong baselines on two public role-oriented dialogue

In
particular, large structures such as urban freeways or ring roads were built
for reducing car traffic congestion. With the evolution of public

organization of large urban areas is uncertain. Here, we analyze empirical data
for US cities and show that they display two transitions at different
thresholds. For the first threshold of order $T_c^{FW}\sim 10^4$ commuters, we
observe the emergence of a urban freeway. The second threshold is larger and of
the order $T_c^{RR}\sim 10^5$ commuters above which a ring road emerges. In
order to understand these empirical results, we propose a simple model based on
a cost-benefit analysis which relies on the balance between construction and
maintenance costs of infrastructures and the trip duration decrease (including
the effect of congestion). This model predicts indeed such transitions and
allows us to compute explicitly the commuter's thresholds in terms of critical
parameters such as the average value of time, average capacity of roads,
typical construction cost, etc. Furthermore, this analysis allows us to discuss
possible scenarios for the future evolution of these structures. In particular,
we show that in many cases it is beneficial to remove urban freeways due to
their large social cost (that includes pollution, health cost, etc). This type
of information is particularly useful at a time when many cities must confront

as broad as possible. It is based on what the cybersecurity research community
for long have asked for, and on what constitutes clear hard legal rules instead
of soft. Important areas such as cybersecurity should be taken seriously, by
regulating it in the same way we see other types of critical infrastructure and
physical structures, and be uncompromising and logical, to encompass the risks
and potential for chaos which its ubiquitous nature entails.
  We find that principles which regulate cybersecurity systems' life-cycles in
detail are needed, as is clearly stating what technology is being used, due to
Kirkhoffs principle, and dismissing the idea of technosolutionism. Furthermore,
carefully analysing risks is always necessary, but so is understanding when and
how the systems manufacturers may fail or almost fail. We do this through the
following principles:
  Ex ante and Ex post assessment, Safety and Security by Design, Denial of
Obscurity, Dismissal of Infallibility, Systems Acknowledgement, Full
Transparency, Movement towards a Zero-trust Security Model, Cybersecurity
Resilience, Enforced Circular Risk Management, Dependability, Hazard Analysis

of Certification and Standards, Mandated Verification of Security and
Continuous Servicing.

as the GDPR and create strong national authorities to coordinate inspection and
enforcement in each Member State, with ENISA being the top and coordinating
organ.

communication of low-latency messages in fast-fading channels under the

full-duplex (FD) jammer capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and
subsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable
communication amidst a strong adversary, we propose non-coherent fast-forward
full-duplex relaying scheme wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to
fast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the
countermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the
constellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing non-coherent
constellation for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the
cooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an
optimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim
and the helper such that the symbol-error-probability at the base station is
minimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose
several strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's
data-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed
constellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade
jamming. Finally, we also prove the scheme's efficacy in deceiving the
countermeasure detectors at the jammer.

images is a necessary prerequisite in the interventions of hepatic
abnormalities and surgery planning. However, accurate liver tumor segmentation
remains challenging due to the large variability of tumor sizes and
inhomogeneous texture. Recent advances based on Fully Convolutional Network
(FCN) for medical image segmentation drew on the success of learning
discriminative pyramid features. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Pyramid
Correlation Network (DPC-Net) that exploits attention mechanisms to fully
leverage both low- and high-level features embedded in FCN to segment liver
tumor. Methods: We first design a powerful Pyramid Feature Encoder (PFE) to
extract multi-level features from input images. Then we decouple the
characteristics of features concerning spatial dimension (i.e., height, width,
depth) and semantic dimension (i.e., channel). On top of that, we present two
types of attention modules, Spatial Correlation (SpaCor) and Semantic
Correlation (SemCor) modules, to recursively measure the correlation of
multi-level features. The former selectively emphasizes global semantic
information in low-level features with the guidance of high-level ones. The
latter adaptively enhance spatial details in high-level features with the
guidance of low-level ones. Results: We evaluate the DPC-Net on MICCAI 2017
LiTS Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge dataset. Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) are employed
for evaluation. The proposed method obtains a DSC of 76.4% and an ASSD of 0.838

To date, the problem of determining the optimal number of matches per unit,

propose a tuning-parameter-free PSM method based on the nonparametric
maximum-likelihood estimation of the propensity score under the monotonicity
constraint. The estimated propensity score is piecewise constant, and therefore
automatically groups data. Hence, our proposal is free of tuning parameters.
The proposed estimator is asymptotically semiparametric efficient for the
univariate case, and achieves this level of efficiency in the multivariate case
when the outcome and the propensity score depend on the covariate in the same
direction. We conclude that matching methods based on the propensity score
alone cannot, in general, be efficient.

hole entropy of static spherically symmetric black holes. When a black hole
absorbs matter its horizon area will increase. Given the spherically fractal
structure, we conjecture that the minimal increase of the horizon area should
be the area of the smallest bubble sphere. From this, we find the black hole
entropy has a logarithmic form, which is similar to that of Boltzmann entropy
if we consider $A/A_{pl}$ as the number of microscopic states. We further
calculate temperatures and heat capacities of Schwarzschild,
Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m(RN), and RN-AdS black holes. It is found that their
temperatures are all monotonically increasing and the heat capacities are all
positive, which means these black holes are thermodynamically stable. Besides,
for RN-AdS black hole we find its heat capacity has Schottky anomaly-like
behavior, which may reflect the existence of the discrete energy level and
restricted microscopical degree of freedom.

of the convective area related to the magnetic dynamo mechanism. The total
X-ray luminosity of an EWX is essentially consistent with that of an X-ray
saturated main sequence star with the same mass as its primary, which may imply
that the primary star dominates the X-ray emission. The monotonically
decreasing $P$-log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$) relation and the short

and they may inherit the changing trend of the saturated X-ray luminosities
along with the mass shown by single stars. For EWXs, the orbital period, mass,
and effective temperature increase in concordance. We demonstrate that the
period $P=0.44$ days corresponds to the primary mass of $\sim1.1 \rm M_\odot$,
beyond which the saturated X-ray luminosity of single stars will not continue
to increase with mass. This explains the break in the positive

breakthroughs in computer vision. Their efficient designs are mostly guided by

the direct speed evaluation on the target platform as the design principle for
efficient ViTs. Particularly, we introduce LITv2, a simple and effective ViT
which performs favourably against the existing state-of-the-art methods across
a spectrum of different model sizes with faster speed. At the core of LITv2 is
a novel self-attention mechanism, which we dub HiLo. HiLo is inspired by the
insight that high frequencies in an image capture local fine details and low
frequencies focus on global structures, whereas a multi-head self-attention
layer neglects the characteristic of different frequencies. Therefore, we
propose to disentangle the high/low frequency patterns in an attention layer by
separating the heads into two groups, where one group encodes high frequencies
via self-attention within each local window, and another group encodes low
frequencies by performing global attention between the average-pooled
low-frequency keys and values from each window and each query position in the
input feature map. Benefiting from the efficient design for both groups, we
show that HiLo is superior to the existing attention mechanisms by
comprehensively benchmarking FLOPs, speed and memory consumption on GPUs and
CPUs. For example, HiLo is 1.4x faster than spatial reduction attention and
1.6x faster than local window attention on CPUs. Powered by HiLo, LITv2 serves
as a strong backbone for mainstream vision tasks including image
classification, dense detection and segmentation. Code is available at

collaboratively by aggregating the locally-computed gradient updates. However,
privacy information could be leaked from uploaded gradients and be exposed to
malicious attackers or an honest-but-curious server. Although the additive
homomorphic encryption technique guarantees the security of this process, it
brings unacceptable computation and communication burdens to FL participants.
To mitigate this cost of secure aggregation and maintain the learning
performance, we propose a new framework called Encoded Gradient Aggregation
(\emph{EGA}). In detail, EGA first encodes local gradient updates into an
encoded domain with injected noises in each client before the aggregation in
the server. Then, the encoded gradients aggregation results can be recovered
for the global model update via a decoding function. This scheme could prevent
the raw gradients of a single client from exposing on the internet and keep
them unknown to the server. EGA could provide optimization and communication
benefits under different noise levels and defend against gradient leakage. We
further provide a theoretical analysis of the approximation error and its
impacts on federated optimization. Moreover, EGA is compatible with the most
federated optimization algorithms. We conduct intensive experiments to evaluate
EGA in real-world federated settings, and the results have demonstrated its
efficacy.

classes without forgetting old ones. Correspondingly, Class-Incremental
Learning (CIL) aims to train a model with limited memory size to meet this
requirement. Typical CIL methods tend to save representative exemplars from
former classes to resist forgetting, while recent works find that storing
models from history can substantially boost the performance. However, the
stored models are not counted into the memory budget, which implicitly results
in unfair comparisons. We find that when counting the model size into the total
budget and comparing methods with aligned memory size, saving models do not
consistently work, especially for the case with limited memory budgets. As a
result, we need to holistically evaluate different CIL methods at different
memory scales and simultaneously consider accuracy and memory size for
measurement. On the other hand, we dive deeply into the construction of the
memory buffer for memory efficiency. By analyzing the effect of different
layers in the network, we find that shallow and deep layers have different
characteristics in CIL. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective
baseline, denoted as MEMO for Memory-efficient Expandable MOdel. MEMO extends
specialized layers based on the shared generalized representations, efficiently
extracting diverse representations with modest cost and maintaining

participation is a result of external events, namely client dropout, rather
than a decision of the FL algorithm. We cast FL with client dropout as a
special case of a larger class of FL problems where clients can submit
substitute (possibly inaccurate) local model updates. Based on our convergence

friends' local updates as substitutes for the dropout clients, thereby reducing
the substitution error and improving the convergence performance. A complexity
reduction mechanism is also incorporated into FL-FDMS, making it both

MMLE for the general linear models when estimating the scales of variance in
the likelihood and prior. The proof is independent of the number ratio of data
to model parameters and excepts the ill-posedness of the associated regularized
least-square model-parameter estimate that is shown asymptotically unbiased.
Second, we generalize the proof to other models with a finite number of

for addressing the complex and computationally demanding problem of hardware
design optimization. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of transformers in
domains including natural language processing and computer vision, their use in
hardware design has been limited by the scarcity of offline data. Our approach
addresses this limitation by introducing strong inductive biases such as
relative positional embeddings and action-permutation symmetricity that
effectively capture the hardware context and enable efficient design
optimization with limited offline data. We apply DevFoemer to the problem of
decoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances
while reducing the number of components by more than $30\%$. Finally, we show
that our approach achieves promising results in other offline contextual
learning-based combinatorial optimization tasks.

planning, where accurate estimations can improve healthcare quality. One issue
affecting the training of survival models is censored data. Most of the current
survival prediction approaches are based on Cox models that can deal with
censored data, but their application scope is limited because they output a
hazard function instead of a survival time. On the other hand, methods that
predict survival time usually ignore censored data, resulting in an
under-utilization of the training set. In this work, we propose a new training
method that predicts survival time using all censored and uncensored data. We
propose to treat censored data as samples with a lower-bound time to death and
estimate pseudo labels to semi-supervise a censor-aware survival time
regressor. We evaluate our method on pathology and x-ray images from the
TCGA-GM and NLST datasets. Our results establish the state-of-the-art survival
prediction accuracy on both datasets.

instability (MRI) and hydrodynamics instability in the presence of an extra
force in the local Keplerian accretion flow. The underlying model is described
by the Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire equations in the presence of rotation,
magnetic field and an extra force, plausibly noise with a nonzero mean. We
obtain MRI using Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation without extra
force for purely vertical magnetic field and vertical wavevector of the
perturbations. Expectedly, MRI is active within a range of magnetic field,
which changes depending on the perturbation wavevector magnitude. Next, to
check the effect of noise on the growth rates, a quartic dispersion relation
has been obtained. Among those four solutions for growth rate, the one that
reduces to MRI growth rate at the limit of vanishing mean of noise in the MRI
active region of the magnetic field, is mostly dominated by MRI. However, in
MRI inactive region, in the presence of noise the solution turns out to be
unstable, which are almost independent of the magnetic field. Another growth
rate, which is almost complementary to the previous one, leads to stability at
the limit of vanishing noise. The remaining two growth rates, which correspond
to the hydrodynamical growth rates at the limit of the vanishing magnetic
field, are completely different from the MRI growth rate. More interestingly,
the latter growth rates are larger than that of the MRI. If we consider
viscosity, the growth rates decrease depending on the Reynolds number.

development has led to the creation of large inter-dependency networks, where
sustainability issues of a single library can have widespread network effects.
Maintainers of these libraries are often overworked, relying on the
contributions of volunteers to sustain these libraries. In this work, we
measure contributions that are aligned with dependency changes, to understand
where they come from (i.e., non-maintainer, client maintainer, library
maintainer, and library and client maintainer), analyze whether they contribute
to library dormancy (i.e., a lack of activity), and investigate the
similarities between these contributions and developers' typical contributions.
Hence, we leverage socio-technical techniques to measure the
dependency-contribution congruence (DC congruence), i.e., the degree to which
contributions align with dependencies. We conduct a large-scale empirical study
to measure the DC congruence for the NPM ecosystem using 1.7 million issues,
970 thousand pull requests (PR), and over 5.3 million commits belonging to
107,242 NPM packages. At the ecosystem level, we pinpoint in time peaks of
congruence with dependency changes (i.e., 16% DC congruence score).
Surprisingly, these contributions came from the ecosystem itself (i.e.,
non-maintainers of either client and library). At the project level, we find
that DC congruence shares a statistically significant relationship with the
likelihood of a package becoming dormant. Finally, by comparing source code of
contributions, we find that congruent contributions are statistically different
to typical contributions. Our work has implications to encourage and sustain
contributions, especially to support library maintainers that require
dependency changes.

end, this paper proposes a modal testing method for subcritical flows. Using
Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), dominate modes of flow around a cylinder at
subcritical Reynolds numbers are extracted experimentally for the first time.
The extracted structures and parameters of the modes are in good agreement with
the numerical results in the literature. It is found that the first-order von
K\'arm\'an mode can be observed at a Reynolds number as low as 19.3, which is
very close to the lower boundary of subcritical vortex induced vibrations
(VIV). This experimental observation elucidates the correlation between von

fabricate one-dimensional and hexagonal two-dimensional arrays, both with
sinusoidal curvature. We successfully observe the suppressed single-photon
evolution patterns, and for the first time measure the variances to study their
transport properties. For one-dimensional arrays, the measured variances match
both the analytical electric field calculation and the quantum walk Hamiltonian
engineering approach. For hexagonal arrays, as anisotropic effective couplings
in four directions are mutually dependent, the analytical approach suffers,
while quantum walk conveniently incorporates all anisotropic coupling
coefficients in the Hamiltonian and solves its exponential as a whole, yielding
consistent variances with our experimental results. Furthermore, we implement a
nearly complete localization to show that it can preserve both the initial
injection and the wave-packet after some evolution, acting as a memory of a
flexible time scale in integrated photonics. We demonstrate a useful quantum
simulation of dynamic localization for studying their anisotropic transport

to the X-ray irradiation has not been evaluated. Then, we conduct an X-ray
irradiation experiment using an X-ray generator with a total dose of 10 krad at
the SiO2 insulator, equivalent to 7 years in orbit. As a result of this
experiment, the energy resolution in full-width half maximum for the 5.9 keV
X-ray degrades by 17.8 $\pm$ 2.8% and the dark current increases by 89 $\pm$
13%. We also investigate the physical mechanism of the increase in the dark
current due to X-ray irradiation using TCAD simulation. It is found that the
increase in the dark current can be explained by the increase in the interface
state density at the Si/SiO2 interface.

The waiting time distributions of individual monomer beads inside the channel
show unique features strongly dependent on the driving force and the surface

universe is currently in a phase of accelerated expansion after a switch from a
decelerated expansion. The redshift corresponding to this epoch is referred to
as the transition redshift $z_t$. In this work we put constraints on the $z_t$
with both model-independent and model-dependent approaches. We consider 32
Hubble parameter measurements and the Pantheon sample of Type Ia Supernovae
(SNe). In order to include the possible systematic effects in this analysis, we
use the full covariance matrix of systematic uncertainties for the Hubble
parameter measurements. We plot a Hubble Phase Space Portrait (HPSP) between
$\dot{H}(z)$ and $H(z)$ in a model-independent way. From this HPSP diagram, we
estimate the transition redshift as well as the current value of the equation
of state parameter $\omega_0$ in a model-independent way. By considering H(z)
measurements, we find the best fit value of $z_t=0.591^{+0.332}_{-0.332}$ and
$\omega_0=-0.677^{+0.238}_{-0.238}$. We obtain the best fit value of
$z_t=0.849^{+0.117}_{-0.117}$ and $\omega_0=-0.870^{+0.013}_{-0.013}$ using the
Pantheon database. Further, we also use a model dependent approach to determine
$z_t$. Here, we consider a non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model as a background
cosmological model. We reconstruct the cosmic triangle plot among
$\log(\Omega_{m0})$, $-\log(2\Omega_{\Lambda0})$ and $3\log(1+z_t)$ where the
constraints of each parameter are determined by the location in this triangle
plot. Using $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda0}$ values, we find the best
value of the transition redshift $z_t=0.619^{+0.580}_{-0.758}$, which is in
good agreement with the Planck 2018 results at $1\sigma$ confidence level. We
also simulate the observed Hubble parameter measurements in the redshift range
$0<z<2$ and perform the same analysis to estimate the transition redshift.

and challenges to optimize recommender systems on the video-sharing platforms.
Users provide complex and multi-faceted responses towards recommendations,
including watch time and various types of interactions with videos. As a
result, established recommendation algorithms that concern a single objective
are not adequate to meet this new demand of optimizing comprehensive user
experiences. In this paper, we formulate the problem of short video
recommendation as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP), where platforms
want to optimize the main goal of user watch time in long term, with the
constraint of accommodating the auxiliary responses of user interactions such
as sharing/downloading videos.
  To solve the constrained MDP, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning
approach based on actor-critic framework. At stage one, we learn individual
policies to optimize each auxiliary response. At stage two, we learn a policy
to (i) optimize the main response and (ii) stay close to policies learned at
the first stage, which effectively guarantees the performance of this main
policy on the auxiliaries. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate
effectiveness of our approach over alternatives in both optimizing the main
goal as well as balancing the others. We further show the advantage of our
approach in live experiments of short video recommendations, where it
significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of watch time and
interactions from video views. Our approach has been fully launched in the
production system to optimize user experiences on the platform.

a test utterance is the same as the reference speech. In the past few years,
extracting speaker embeddings using deep neural networks for SV systems has
gone mainstream. Recently, different attention mechanisms and Transformer
networks have been explored widely in SV fields. However, utilizing the
original Transformer in SV directly may have frame-level information waste on
output features, which could lead to restrictions on capacity and
discrimination of speaker embeddings. Therefore, we propose an approach to
derive utterance-level speaker embeddings via a Transformer architecture that
uses a novel loss function named diffluence loss to integrate the feature
information of different Transformer layers. Therein, the diffluence loss aims
to aggregate frame-level features into an utterance-level representation, and
it could be integrated into the Transformer expediently. Besides, we also
introduce a learnable mel-fbank energy feature extractor named time-domain
feature extractor that computes the mel-fbank features more precisely and
efficiently than the standard mel-fbank extractor. Combining Diffluence loss
and Time-domain feature extractor, we propose a novel Transformer-based
time-domain SV model (DT-SV) with faster training speed and higher accuracy.
Experiments indicate that our proposed model can achieve better performance in
comparison with other models.

Furthermore, disturbances arising from unmodelled contact interactions with the

stochastic trajectory optimization for generating robust centroidal momentum
trajectories to account for additive uncertainties on the model dynamics and
parametric uncertainties on contact locations. Through an alternation between
the robust centroidal and whole-body trajectory optimizations, we generate
robust momentum trajectories while being consistent with the whole-body

generalizing the log-linear learning dynamics to MG settings and address the
latter through the play-in-rounds scheme presented. Particularly, in an MG,
agents play (normal-form) stage games associated with the state visited based
on their continuation payoff estimates. We let the agents play these stage
games in rounds such that their continuation payoff estimates get updated only
at the end of the round. This makes these stage games stationary within each

special new media type that combines text with images and is used in social
media to playfully or subtly express humour, irony, sarcasm and even hate. It
is important to accurately retrieve image memes from social media to better
capture the cultural and social aspects of online phenomena and detect
potential issues (hate-speech, disinformation). Essentially, the background
image of an image macro is a regular image easily recognized as such by humans
but cumbersome for the machine to do so due to feature map similarity with the

can lead to deep understanding of the notion of image memes. To this end, we
propose a methodology, called Visual Part Utilization, that utilizes the visual
part of image memes as instances of the regular image class and the initial
image memes as instances of the image meme class to force the model to
concentrate on the critical parts that characterize an image meme.
Additionally, we employ a trainable attention mechanism on top of a standard
ViT architecture to enhance the model's ability to focus on these critical

of this problem is $H$-ColoringExt, where some vertices of $G$ are already
mapped to vertices of $H$ and we ask if this partial mapping can be extended to
an $H$-coloring.
  We study the complexity of variants of $H$-Coloring in $F$-free graphs, i.e.,
graphs excluding a fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. For integers $a,b,c

interesting non-monotonicity of $H$-ColoringExt with respect to taking induced

classical 3-coloring, is NP-hard already in claw-free (i.e., $S_{1,1,1}$-free)

  Our algorithm is based on two main observations:
  1. $W_5$-ColoringExt in $S_{2,1,1}$-free graphs can be in polynomial time
reduced to a variant of the problem of finding an independent set intersecting
all triangles, and
  2. the latter problem can be solved in polynomial time in $S_{2,1,1}$-free

  We complement this algorithmic result with several negative ones. In
particular, we show that $W_5$-ColoringExt is NP-hard in $S_{3,3,3}$-free

disc storage. These limitations become more evident when handling demanding
applications, such as deep learning, well-known for their heavy computational
requirements. A case in point is robot pose estimation, an application that
predicts the critical points of the desired image object. One way to mitigate
processing and storage problems is compressing that deep learning application.
This paper proposes a new CNN for the pose estimation while applying the
compression techniques of pruning and quantization to reduce his demands and
improve the response time. While the pruning process reduces the total number
of parameters required for inference, quantization decreases the precision of
the floating-point. We run the approach using a pose estimation task for a
robotic arm and compare the results in a high-end device and a constrained
device. As metrics, we consider the number of Floating-point Operations Per
Second(FLOPS), the total of mathematical computations, the calculation of
parameters, the inference time, and the number of video frames processed per
second. In addition, we undertake a qualitative evaluation where we compare the
output image predicted for each pruned network with the corresponding original
one. We reduce the originally proposed network to a 70% pruning rate, implying
an 88.86% reduction in parameters, 94.45% reduction in FLOPS, and for the disc
storage, we reduced the requirement in 70% while increasing error by a mere
$1\%$. With regard input image processing, this metric increases from 11.71 FPS
to 41.9 FPS for the Desktop case. When using the constrained device, image
processing augmented from 2.86 FPS to 10.04 FPS. The higher processing rate of
image frames achieved by the proposed approach allows a much shorter response
time.

is challenging: collecting online human-agent interactions is slow and
expensive, yet faster proxy metrics often do not correlate well with
interactive evaluation. In this paper, we assess the merits of these existing
evaluation metrics and present a novel approach to evaluation called the
Standardised Test Suite (STS). The STS uses behavioural scenarios mined from
real human interaction data. Agents see replayed scenario context, receive an
instruction, and are then given control to complete the interaction offline.
These agent continuations are recorded and sent to human annotators to mark as
success or failure, and agents are ranked according to the proportion of
continuations in which they succeed. The resulting STS is fast, controlled,
interpretable, and representative of naturalistic interactions. Altogether, the
STS consolidates much of what is desirable across many of our standard
evaluation metrics, allowing us to accelerate research progress towards
producing agents that can interact naturally with humans. A video may be found

more low-level spatial information of the image compared to other computer

many factors, such as imaging limitations and the ambiguity of object
boundaries in an image. Conventional methods exploit three-channel RGB images
captured in the visible spectrum with deep neural networks (DNN). Thermal
images can significantly contribute during the segmentation since thermal
imaging cameras are capable of capturing details despite the weather and
illumination conditions. Using infrared spectrum in semantic segmentation has
many real-world use cases, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging,
agriculture, defense industry, etc. Due to this wide range of use cases,
designing accurate semantic segmentation algorithms with the help of infrared
spectrum is an important challenge. One approach is to use both visible and
infrared spectrum images as inputs. These methods can accomplish higher
accuracy due to enriched input information, with the cost of extra effort for
the alignment and processing of multiple inputs. Another approach is to use
only thermal images, enabling less hardware cost for smaller use cases. Even
though there are multiple surveys on semantic segmentation methods, the
literature lacks a comprehensive survey centered explicitly around semantic
segmentation using infrared spectrum. This work aims to fill this gap by

10cm and partial visibility of objects. Due to the large radial distortion of
fisheye cameras, standard algorithms cannot be extended easily to the
surround-view use case. Thus, we are motivated to provide a self-contained

practitioners. Firstly, we provide a unified and taxonomic treatment of
commonly used fisheye camera models. Secondly, we discuss various perception

subtle inter-class variations are difficult to be captured. One notable
research line uses the Global Covariance Pooling (GCP) layer to learn powerful
representations with second-order statistics, which can effectively model
inter-class differences. In our previous conference paper, we show that
truncating small eigenvalues of the GCP covariance can attain smoother gradient
and improve the performance on large-scale benchmarks. However, on fine-grained
datasets, truncating the small eigenvalues would make the model fail to
converge. This observation contradicts the common assumption that the small
eigenvalues merely correspond to the noisy and unimportant information.
Consequently, ignoring them should have little influence on the performance. To
diagnose this peculiar behavior, we propose two attribution methods whose
visualizations demonstrate that the seemingly unimportant small eigenvalues are
crucial as they are in charge of extracting the discriminative class-specific
features. Inspired by this observation, we propose a network branch dedicated
to magnifying the importance of small eigenvalues. Without introducing any
additional parameters, this branch simply amplifies the small eigenvalues and
achieves state-of-the-art performances of GCP methods on three fine-grained
benchmarks. Furthermore, the performance is also competitive against other FGVC
approaches on larger datasets. Code is available at

extremely important for the theoretical study of deep learning. In this work,
we discover an embedding principle in depth that loss landscape of an NN
""contains"" all critical points of the loss landscapes for shallower NNs. The
key tool for our discovery is the critical lifting operator proposed in this
work that maps any critical point of a network to critical manifolds of any
deeper network while preserving the outputs. This principle provides new
insights to many widely observed behaviors of DNNs. Regarding the easy training
of deep networks, we show that local minimum of an NN can be lifted to strict
saddle points of a deeper NN. Regarding the acceleration effect of batch
normalization, we demonstrate that batch normalization helps avoid the critical
manifolds lifted from shallower NNs by suppressing layer linearization. We also
prove that increasing training data shrinks the lifted critical manifolds,
which can result in acceleration of training as demonstrated in experiments.
Overall, our discovery of the embedding principle in depth uncovers the
depth-wise hierarchical structure of deep learning loss landscape, which serves
as a solid foundation for the further study about the role of depth for DNNs.

distortion. On the other hand, it was shown that self-supervised pre-training
enables the utilization of a large amount of unlabeled noisy data, which is
rather beneficial for the noise robustness of ASR. However, the potential of
the (optimal) integration of SE and self-supervised pre-training still remains
unclear. In order to find an appropriate combination and reduce the impact of
speech distortion caused by SE, in this paper we therefore propose a joint
pre-training approach for the SE module and the self-supervised model. First,
in the pre-training phase the original noisy waveform or the waveform obtained
by SE is fed into the self-supervised model to learn the contextual
representation, where the quantified clean speech acts as the target. Second,
we propose a dual-attention fusion method to fuse the features of noisy and
enhanced speeches, which can compensate the information loss caused by
separately using individual modules. Due to the flexible exploitation of
clean/noisy/enhanced branches, the proposed method turns out to be a
generalization of some existing noise-robust ASR models, e.g., enhanced
wav2vec2.0. Finally, experimental results on both synthetic and real noisy
datasets show that the proposed joint training approach can improve the ASR

provide a completely analytical nonlinear model to decompose the entangled

The standard view, based on light-tailed distributions (i.e. distributions with
finite moments), is that the probability of parallel evolution in duplicate
populations is inversely proportional to the number of available mutations, and
moreover that the DBFE is sufficient to determine the probability when the
number of available mutations is large. Here we show that when the DBFE is
heavy-tailed, as found in several recent experiments, these expectations are
defied. The probability of parallel evolution decays anomalously slowly in the
number of mutations or even becomes independent of it, implying higher
repeatability of evolution. At the same time, the probability of parallel
evolution is non-self-averaging, that is, it does not converge to its mean
value even when a large number of mutations are involved. This behavior arises
because the evolutionary process is dominated by only a few mutations of high
weight. Consequently, the probability varies widely across systems with the
same DBFE. Contrary to the standard view, the DBFE is no longer sufficient to
determine the extent of parallel evolution, making it much less predictable. We
illustrate these ideas theoretically and through analysis of empirical data on

the prior information of observed trajectory to model multiple future
trajectories. Specifically, a path in the tree from the root to leaf represents
an individual possible future trajectory. SIT employs a coarse-to-fine
optimization strategy, in which the tree is first built by high-order velocity
to balance the complexity and coverage of the tree and then optimized greedily
to encourage multimodality. Finally, a teacher-forcing refining operation is
used to predict the final fine trajectory. Compared with prior methods which
leverage implicit latent variables to represent possible future trajectories,
the path in the tree can explicitly explain the rough moving behaviors (e.g.,
go straight and then turn right), and thus provides better interpretability.

reduced energy dissipation during the foot-ground collision; capacity to store

Cumulatively, these effects should reduce both neuromotor fatigue and sense of

integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data remain largely incomplete. In this paper
(the second of a series), we introduce the geostatistical technique of
universal kriging, which allows the complete 2D metallicity distribution of a
galaxy to be reconstructed from metallicities measured at Hii regions,
accounting for spatial correlations between nearby data points. We apply this
method to construct high-fidelity metallicity maps of the local spiral galaxy
NGC 5236 using data from the TYPHOON/PrISM survey. We find significant
correlation in the metallicity of Hii regions separated by up to 0.4-1.2 kpc.
Predictions constructed using this method were tested using cross-validation in
Hii regions, and we show that they outperform significantly interpolation based
on metallicity gradients. Furthermore, we apply kriging to predict the
metallicities in regions dominated by DIG emission, considering seven
additional spiral galaxies with high resolution (<100pc) metallicity maps. We
compare kriging maps to DIG metallicities computed with novel ionisation
corrections, and find that such corrections introduce a systematic offset of up
to $\pm0.1$ dex for any individual galaxy, with a scatter of 0.02-0.07 dex for
the sample. Overall we recommend universal kriging, together with a calibrated
geostatistical model, as the superior method for inferring the metallicities of
DIG-dominated regions in local spiral galaxies, demonstrating further the
potential of applying geostatistical methods to spatially resolved galaxy
observations.

equilibria, a new formulation of the shallow water system, called Flux
Globalization has been introduced by Cheng et al. (2019). This approach
consists in including the integral of the source term in the global flux and
reconstructing the new global flux rather than the conservative variables. The
resulting scheme is able to preserve a large family of smooth and discontinuous
steady state moving equilibria. In this work, we focus on an arbitrary high
order WENO Finite Volume (FV) generalization of the global flux approach. The
most delicate aspect of the algorithm is the appropriate definition of the
source flux (integral of the source term) and the quadrature strategy used to
match it with the WENO reconstruction of the hyperbolic flux. When this
construction is correctly done, one can show that the resulting WENO FV scheme
admits exact discrete steady states characterized by constant global fluxes. We
also show that, by an appropriate quadrature strategy for the source, we can
embed exactly some particular steady states, e.g. the lake at rest for the
shallow water equations. It can be shown that an exact approximation of global
fluxes leads to a scheme with better convergence properties and improved
solutions. The novel method has been tested and validated on classical cases:
subcritical, supercritical and transcritical flows.

buyer MNOs lease several licensed sub-bands from different seller MNOs. All

the interference that a buyer MNO imposes on one seller MNO sharing its

caused to the corresponding seller MNO's users. We assume each MNO owns its BSs
and users whose locations are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson

downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio coverage probability and the
average rate of both seller and buyer networks. The numerical results validate
our analysis with simulation and illustrate the effect of the maximum

message passing -- aggregating information from 1-hop neighbors repeatedly.
However, the expressive power of 1-hop message passing is bounded by the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Recently, researchers extended 1-hop message
passing to K-hop message passing by aggregating information from K-hop
neighbors of nodes simultaneously. However, there is no work on analyzing the
expressive power of K-hop message passing. In this work, we theoretically
characterize the expressive power of K-hop message passing. Specifically, we
first formally differentiate two different kernels of K-hop message passing
which are often misused in previous works. We then characterize the expressive
power of K-hop message passing by showing that it is more powerful than 1-WL
and can distinguish almost all regular graphs. Despite the higher expressive
power, we show that K-hop message passing still cannot distinguish some simple
regular graphs and its expressive power is bounded by 3-WL. To further enhance
its expressive power, we introduce a KP-GNN framework, which improves K-hop
message passing by leveraging the peripheral subgraph information in each hop.
We show that KP-GNN can distinguish many distance regular graphs which could
not be distinguished by previous distance encoding or 3-WL methods.
Experimental results verify the expressive power and effectiveness of KP-GNN.
KP-GNN achieves competitive results across all benchmark datasets.

advertising budgets, equipped to adapt to varying ad sale platform conditions.
On the demand side, advertisers face a fundamental technical challenge in
automating bidding in a way that spreads their allotted budget across a given
campaign subject to hidden, and potentially dynamic, cost functions. This
automation and calculation must be done in runtime, implying a necessarily low
computational cost for the high frequency auction rate. Advertisers are
additionally expected to exhaust nearly all of their sub-interval (by the hour
or minute) budgets to maintain budgeting quotas in the long run. To resolve
this challenge, our study analyzes a simple learning algorithm that adapts to
the latent cost function of the market and learns the optimal average bidding
value for a period of auctions in a small fraction of the total campaign time,
allowing for smooth budget pacing in real-time. We prove our algorithm is
robust to changes in the auction mechanism, and exhibits a fast convergence to
a stable average bidding strategy. The algorithm not only guarantees that
budgets are nearly spent in their entirety, but also smoothly paces bidding to
prevent early exit from the campaign and a loss of the opportunity to bid on
potentially lucrative impressions later in the period.
  In addition to the theoretical guarantees, we validate our algorithm with
experimental results from open source data on real advertising campaigns to
further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

terms of an integral transform, obtaining analytic results when $t
\log{s}\rightarrow 0$. Carefully applying this limit to dispersion relations,
we find that infinite arc integrals, which are usually taken to vanish, can
give a non-trivial contribution in the presence of gravity, unlike in the case
of finite negative $t$. This implies that gravitational positivity bounds
cannot be trusted unless the size of this contribution is estimated in some

inherent scaling symmetry that the energy of the system does not have. The
symmetry also assures that entropy divergence can be associated with the zero
modes. We generalize this symmetry to time-dependent systems all the way from a
coupled harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency, to quantum scalar
fields with time-dependent mass. We show that such systems have dynamical
scaling symmetry that leaves the evolution of various measures of quantum
correlations invariant -- entanglement entropy, GS fidelity, Loschmidt echo,
and circuit complexity. Using this symmetry, we show that several quantum
correlations are related at late-times when the system develops instabilities.
We then quantify such instabilities in terms of scrambling time and Lyapunov
exponents. The delayed onset of exponential decay of the Loschmidt echo is
found to be determined by the largest inverted mode in the system. On the other
hand, a zero-mode retains information about the system for a considerably
longer time, finally resulting in a power-law decay of the Loschmidt echo. We
extend the analysis to time-dependent massive scalar fields in $(1 +

occurring in the system at late-times. We explicitly show the entropy scaling
oscillates between the \emph{area-law} and \emph{volume-law} for a scalar field

repair. However, the black-box nature of these methods has restricted their
practical applications. To address this challenge, this paper presents an
interpretable approach for program repair based on sequence-to-sequence models
with causal inference and our method is called CPR, short for causal program
repair. Our CPR can generate explanations in the process of decision making,
which consists of groups of causally related input-output tokens. Firstly, our
method infers these relations by querying the model with inputs disturbed by
data augmentation. Secondly, it generates a graph over tokens from the
responses and solves a partitioning problem to select the most relevant
components. The experiments on four programming languages (Java, C, Python, and
JavaScript) show that CPR can generate causal graphs for reasonable
interpretations and boost the performance of bug fixing in automatic program
repair.

keyword-level, where we assume words are sampled nodes from a sentence
distribution. Finally, to bridge the gap between independent contrast levels
and tackle the common contrast vanishing problem, we propose an inter-contrast
mechanism that measures the discrepancy between contrastive keyword nodes
respectively to the instance distribution. Experiments demonstrate that our
model outperforms competitive baselines on paraphrasing, dialogue generation,

fundamental shortcomings of current vision-based AI systems, particularly when

system (Loci), which excels on the CATER tracking challenge. Inspired by the
dorsal and ventral pathways in the brain, Loci tackles the binding problem by
processing separate, slot-wise encodings of `what' and `where'. Loci's
predictive coding-like processing encourages active error minimization, such
that individual slots tend to encode individual objects. Interactions between
objects and object dynamics are processed in the disentangled latent space.
Truncated backpropagation through time combined with forward eligibility
accumulation significantly speeds up learning and improves memory efficiency.
Besides exhibiting superior performance in current benchmarks, Loci effectively
extracts objects from video streams and separates them into location and
Gestalt components. We believe that this separation offers a representation
that will facilitate effective planning and reasoning on conceptual levels.

Our methodology consists of four steps; in detail, given a legal case as a
query, we reformulate it by extracting various meaningful sentences or n-grams.
Then, we utilize the pre-processed query case to retrieve an initial set of
possible relevant legal cases, which we further re-rank. Lastly, we aggregate
the relevance scores obtained by the first stage and the re-ranking models to
improve retrieval effectiveness. In each step of our methodology, we explore
various well-known and novel methods. In particular, to reformulate the query
cases aiming to make them shorter, we extract unigrams using three different
statistical methods: KLI, PLM, IDF-r, as well as models that leverage
embeddings (e.g., KeyBERT). Moreover, we investigate if automatic summarization
using Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) can produce an effective query
representation for this retrieval task. Furthermore, we propose a novel
re-ranking cluster-driven approach, which leverages Sentence-BERT models that
are pre-tuned on large amounts of data for embedding sentences from query and
candidate documents. Finally, we employ a linear aggregation method to combine
the relevance scores obtained by traditional IR models and neural-based models,
aiming to incorporate the semantic understanding of neural models and the
statistically measured topical relevance. We show that aggregating these

In this paper, we present the TRAS (TRAnsfer and Share) to effectively utilize

Interestingly, TRAS shows that more balanced pseudo-label distribution can
substantially benefit minority-class training, instead of seeking to generate
accurate pseudo-labels as in previous works. To simplify the approach, TRAS
merges the training of the traditional SSL model and the target model into a
single procedure by sharing the feature extractor, where both classifiers help
improve the representation learning. According to extensive experiments, TRAS
delivers much higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in the entire set

modes is defined to clearly determine the effect of the reservoir modes on the
qubit decay and dephasing rates. The main goal is to theoretically calculate
the dephasing and decay rate of a qubit, particularly due to the circuitry
effect. Firstly, the Hamiltonian of the system (coupling of a qubit to the
reservoir modes) is defined and used to derive the time evolution of the
density matrix for the qubit energy levels. By calculating the qubit level
density evolutions, one can estimate at which frequency the maximum coupling
occurs and, in addition, knows about the role of the electromagnetic bias in
the qubit. Secondly, the qubit decay rate is theoretically derived. The results
show that the decay rate is strongly affected by circuitry elements such as the
qubit capacitor and, more importantly, the coupling capacitor between the qubit
and the reservoir modes. As the main result, it is shown that the slight
decrease in the coupling capacitors significantly affects the relaxation time
even more than the qubit capacitor. Consequently, the dephasing rate, which is
the effect of the reservoir modes on the transition frequency of the qubit, is
theoretically examined using the Heisenberg-Langevin equation. Finally, by
transforming the Heisenberg-Langevin equations into the Fourier domain, the
number of photons of the qubit due to coupling to reservoir modes are
calculated. This is considered to be the photons generated in the qubit owing
to the noise effect. This term significantly influences the qubit coherence
time.

release. For this reason, changing functions to satisfy the requirements of IoT
systems is difficult. In this study, we focus on updating existing embedded
systems without modifying them. We investigate the design of new functions and
their implementation with limited resources. This paper describes an evolution
mechanism for updating the functionalities of existing embedded systems. The
evolution mechanism uses a control unit that is deployed outside the embedded
system. To guide the steady implementation of the evolution mechanism, we
define an evolution process that effectively uses the state machine diagram at
the design time and runtime to update the embedded systems. The programming
framework implemented in this study supports the evolution process. We evaluate
the evolution mechanism based on the results from two experiments. The first
experiment involved applying the evolution mechanism to a cleaning robot, this
demonstrated that the evolution mechanism systematically enables the injection
of new functions into an embedded system in the real world. The second
experiment, on the probabilistic model checking, demonstrated that the
mechanism provides almost the same performance as the ordinary embedded system
with an improved robustness.

systems, such as technological infrastructures, ecological systems, gene

exists also a potential state with abnormal low activity, although the system
is at equilibrium it might make a transition into the low activity undesired
state due to external disturbances and perturbations. Thus, such a system can
be regarded as unsustainable, due to the danger of falling into the potential
inactive state. Here we explore, analytically and by simulations, how
supporting the activity of a fraction $\rho$ of nodes can turn an unsustainable
system to be sustainable by eliminating the inactive potential stable state. We
thus unveil a new sustainability phase diagram in the presence of a fraction of
controlled nodes $\rho$. This phase diagram could provide guidelines to sustain
a network by external intervention and/or by strengthening the connectivity of
the network.

and beyond, and achieving a universal understanding is an exciting prospect.
The beyond-Landau quantum criticality of Kondo destruction has had considerable
success in describing the behavior of strange metal heavy fermion compounds,
and there is some evidence that the associated partial
localization-delocalization nature can be generalized to diverse materials
classes. Other potential overarching principles at play are also being
explored. An intriguing proposal is that Planckian scattering, with a rate of
$k_{\rm B}T/\hbar$, leads to the linear temperature dependence of the (dc)
electrical resistivity, which is a hallmark of strange metal behavior. Here we
extend a previously introduced analysis scheme based on the Drude description
of the dc resistivity to optical conductivity data. When they are well
described by a simple (ac) Drude model, the scattering rate can be directly
extracted. This avoids the need to determine the ratio of charge carrier
concentration to effective mass, which has complicated previous analyses based
on the dc resistivity. However, we point out that strange metals typically
exhibit strong deviations from Drude behavior, as exemplified by the
``extreme'' strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. This calls for alternative
approaches, and we point to the power of strange metal dynamical
(energy-over-temperature) scaling analyses for the inelastic part of the
optical conductivity. If such scaling extends to the low-frequency limit, a
strange metal relaxation rate can be estimated, and may ultimately be used to
test whether strange metals relax in a Planckian manner.

we introduce a continual learning (CL) approach that can handle the
incrementally growing gallery set with backward embedding consistency. We
enforce the losses of inter-session data coherence, neighbor-session model
coherence, and intra-session discrimination to conduct a continual learner. In
addition to the disjoint setup, our CL solution also tackles the situation of
increasingly adding new classes for the blurry boundary without assuming all
categories known in the beginning and during model update. To our knowledge,
this is the first CL method both tackling the issue of backward-consistent

original Transformer. As far as we know, theoretical understanding of the
RPE-based Transformers is largely unexplored. In this work, we mathematically
analyze the power of RPE-based Transformers regarding whether the model is
capable of approximating any continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. One may
naturally assume the answer is in the affirmative -- RPE-based Transformers are
universal function approximators. However, we present a negative result by
showing there exist continuous sequence-to-sequence functions that RPE-based
Transformers cannot approximate no matter how deep and wide the neural network
is. One key reason lies in that most RPEs are placed in the softmax attention
that always generates a right stochastic matrix. This restricts the network
from capturing positional information in the RPEs and limits its capacity. To
overcome the problem and make the model more powerful, we first present
sufficient conditions for RPE-based Transformers to achieve universal function
approximation. With the theoretical guidance, we develop a novel attention
module, called Universal RPE-based (URPE) Attention, which satisfies the
conditions. Therefore, the corresponding URPE-based Transformers become
universal function approximators. Extensive experiments covering typical
architectures and tasks demonstrate that our model is parameter-efficient and
can achieve superior performance to strong baselines in a wide range of
applications. The code will be made publicly available at

the effects of rainbow gravity tend to decrease the Hawking temperature but
increase the black hole entropy in ST frame, and increase the Hawking

protocols that protect agents' sensitive information while still allowing them
to collaborate. Often, a network system and controller are first designed and
implemented, and then privacy is only incorporated after that. However, the
absence of privacy from the design process can make it difficult to implement
without significantly harming system performance. To help address this need,
this paper presents a co-design framework for multi-agent networks and private
controllers that we apply to the problem of private formation control. Agents'
state trajectories are protected using differential privacy, which is a
statistical notion of privacy that protects data by adding noise to it. Privacy
noise alters the performance of the network, which we quantify by computing a
bound for the steady-state error for private formations. Then, we analyze
tradeoffs between privacy level, system performance, and connectedness of the
network's communication topology. These trade-offs are used to formulate a
co-design optimization framework to design the optimal communication topology
alongside the optimal privacy parameters for a network running differentially
private formation control. Simulation results illustrate the scalability of our
proposed privacy/network co-design problem to large multi-agent networks, as
well as the high quality of formations one can attain, even with privacy

It generalizes
an abstract energy function -- a Lyapunov function -- to the case of controlled
systems. It is a known fact that most control Lyapunov functions are non-smooth
-- so is the case in non-holonomic systems, like wheeled robots and cars.
Frameworks for stabilization using non-smooth control Lyapunov functions exist,
like Dini aiming and steepest descent. This work generalizes the related
results to the stochastic case. As the groundwork, sampled control scheme is
chosen in which control actions are computed at discrete moments in time using
discrete measurements of the system state. In such a setup, special attention
should be paid to the sample-to-sample behavior of the control Lyapunov
function. A particular challenge here is a random noise acting on the system.
The central result of this work is a theorem that states, roughly, that if
there is a, generally non-smooth, control Lyapunov function, the given
stochastic dynamical system can be practically stabilized in the
sample-and-hold mode meaning that the control actions are held constant within
sampling time steps. A particular control method chosen is based on
Moreau-Yosida regularization, in other words, inf-convolution of the control
Lyapunov function, but the overall framework is extendable to further control
schemes. It is assumed that the system noise be bounded almost surely, although
the case of unbounded noise is briefly addressed.

utilized to reduce the computational burden of generating forecasts and
estimating model uncertainty without losing the key information needed for data
assimilation to produce accurate state estimates. This paper aims at exploring
an equation-free surrogate modeling approach at the intersection of machine
learning and data assimilation in Earth system modeling. With this objective,
we introduce an end-to-end non-intrusive reduced-order modeling (NIROM)
framework equipped with contributions in modal decomposition, time series
prediction, optimal sensor placement, and sequential data assimilation.
Specifically, we use proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to identify the
dominant structures of the flow, and a long short-term memory network to model
the dynamics of the POD modes. The NIROM is integrated within the deterministic
ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF) to incorporate sparse and noisy observations at
optimal sensor locations obtained through QR pivoting. The feasibility and the
benefit of the proposed framework are demonstrated for the NOAA Optimum
Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (SST) V2 dataset. Our results indicate
that the NIROM is stable for long-term forecasting and can model dynamics of
SST with a reasonable level of accuracy. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy
of the NIROM gets improved by one order of magnitude by the DEnKF algorithm.
This work provides a way forward toward transitioning these methods to fuse

and in the context of three brain diseases, we provide evidence which suggests
that when properly trained, machine learning models can generalize well across
diverse conditions and do not necessarily suffer from bias. Specifically, by
using multi-study magnetic resonance imaging consortia for diagnosing
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder, we find that
well-trained models have a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) on subjects across
different subgroups pertaining to attributes such as gender, age, racial
groups, and different clinical studies and are unbiased under multiple fairness
metrics such as demographic parity difference, equalized odds difference, equal
opportunity difference etc. We find that models that incorporate multi-source
data from demographic, clinical, genetic factors and cognitive scores are also
unbiased. These models have better predictive AUC across subgroups than those
trained only with imaging features but there are also situations when these
additional features do not help.

actions from long untrimmed videos remains a challenging problem. Most
state-of-the-art methods focus on designing temporal convolution-based models,
but the inflexibility of temporal convolutions and the difficulties in modeling
long-term temporal dependencies restrict the potential of these models.
Transformer-based models with adaptable and sequence modeling capabilities have
recently been used in various tasks. However, the lack of inductive bias and
the inefficiency of handling long video sequences limit the application of
Transformer in action segmentation. In this paper, we design a pure
Transformer-based model without temporal convolutions by incorporating temporal
sampling, called Temporal U-Transformer (TUT). The U-Transformer architecture
reduces complexity while introducing an inductive bias that adjacent frames are
more likely to belong to the same class, but the introduction of coarse
resolutions results in the misclassification of boundaries. We observe that the
similarity distribution between a boundary frame and its neighboring frames
depends on whether the boundary frame is the start or end of an action segment.
Therefore, we further propose a boundary-aware loss based on the distribution
of similarity scores between frames from attention modules to enhance the
ability to recognize boundaries. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness

et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The
original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations
encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the
syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end
up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res
over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a
comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle
this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only
LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently
known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from
Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res
and LQU$^+$-Res.
  Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i)
MRes is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system,
and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an
exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the
context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal
variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without
weakening. These results suggest that MRes is better used with weakening,
though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open.
We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$
$\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and
Slivovsky).

summation, and operations of conjugation. All the formulas are verified using
computer calculations. We present an analytical proof of all formulas in the

to obtain the results of this paper. We also present formulas for
characteristic polynomial coefficients in some special cases. In particular,
the formulas for vectors (elements of grade $1$) and basis elements are
presented in the case of arbitrary $n$, the formulas for rotors (elements of

on sparsity which is much smaller than the ambient dimension, the worst-case
minimax regret is $\widetilde{\Theta}\left(\sqrt{dT}\right)$ where $d$ is the
ambient dimension and $T$ is the number of rounds. On the other hand, in the
benign setting where there is no noise and the action set is the unit sphere,
one can use divide-and-conquer to achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(1)$ regret,
which is (nearly) independent of $d$ and $T$. In this paper, we present the
first variance-aware regret guarantee for sparse linear bandits:
$\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left(\sqrt{d\sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2} + 1\right)$, where
$\sigma_t^2$ is the variance of the noise at the $t$-th round. This bound
naturally interpolates the regret bounds for the worst-case constant-variance
regime (i.e., $\sigma_t \equiv \Omega(1)$) and the benign deterministic regimes
(i.e., $\sigma_t \equiv 0$). To achieve this variance-aware regret guarantee,
we develop a general framework that converts any variance-aware linear bandit
algorithm to a variance-aware algorithm for sparse linear bandits in a
""black-box"" manner. Specifically, we take two recent algorithms as black boxes
to illustrate that the claimed bounds indeed hold, where the first algorithm
can handle unknown-variance cases and the second one is more efficient.

chosen, and the learner only observes the losses for the visited state-action
pairs (i.e., bandit feedback). While there has been a surge of studies on this
problem using Online-Mirror-Descent (OMD) methods, very little is known about
the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) methods, which are usually
computationally more efficient and also easier to implement since it only
requires solving an offline planning problem. Motivated by this, we take a
closer look at FTPL for learning AMDPs, starting from the standard episodic
finite-horizon setting. We find some unique and intriguing difficulties in the
analysis and propose a workaround to eventually show that FTPL is also able to
achieve near-optimal regret bounds in this case. More importantly, we then find
two significant applications: First, the analysis of FTPL turns out to be
readily generalizable to delayed bandit feedback with order-optimal regret,
while OMD methods exhibit extra difficulties (Jin et al., 2022). Second, using
FTPL, we also develop the first no-regret algorithm for learning communicating
AMDPs in the infinite-horizon setting with bandit feedback and stochastic
transitions. Our algorithm is efficient assuming access to an offline planning
oracle, while even for the easier full-information setting, the only existing
algorithm (Chandrasekaran and Tewari, 2021) is computationally inefficient.

gradient-based training of neural networks, as the greedy updates result in
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Despite the progress
in the field of continual learning to overcome this forgetting, we show that a
set of common state-of-the-art methods still suffers from substantial
forgetting upon starting to learn new tasks, except that this forgetting is
temporary and followed by a phase of performance recovery. We refer to this
intriguing but potentially problematic phenomenon as the stability gap. The
stability gap had likely remained under the radar due to standard practice in
the field of evaluating continual learning models only after each task.
Instead, we establish a framework for continual evaluation that uses
per-iteration evaluation and we define a new set of metrics to quantify
worst-case performance. Empirically we show that experience replay,
constraint-based replay, knowledge-distillation, and parameter regularization
methods are all prone to the stability gap; and that the stability gap can be
observed in class-, task-, and domain-incremental learning benchmarks.
Additionally, a controlled experiment shows that the stability gap increases
when tasks are more dissimilar. Finally, by disentangling gradients into
plasticity and stability components, we propose a conceptual explanation for
the stability gap.

for deeper circuits to be run, but each additional physical qubit can
potentially contribute an exponential increase in computational space, so there
is a trade-off between using qubits for error correction or using them as noisy
qubits. In this work we look at the effects of using noisy qubits in
conjunction with noiseless qubits (an idealized model for error-corrected
qubits), which we call the ""clean and dirty"" setup. We employ analytical models
and numerical simulations to characterize this setup. Numerically we show the
appearance of Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBPs), i.e., an exponential
concentration of observables caused by noise, in an Ising model Hamiltonian
variational ansatz circuit. We observe this even if only a single qubit is
noisy and given a deep enough circuit, suggesting that NIBPs cannot be fully
overcome simply by error-correcting a subset of the qubits. On the positive
side, we find that for every noiseless qubit in the circuit, there is an
exponential suppression in concentration of gradient observables, showing the
benefit of partial error correction. Finally, our analytical models corroborate
these findings by showing that observables concentrate with a scaling in the
exponent related to the ratio of dirty-to-total qubits.

series in two non-commutative variables $a,b$ defined as an iterated integral
of the Kronecker function $F_\tau$. We study a family of {\it Fay relations}
satisfied by $A_\tau$, derived from the original Fay relation satisfied by the
$F_\tau$. The Fay relations of $A_\tau$ were studied by Broedel, Matthes and
Schlotterer, and determined up to non-explicit correction terms that arise from
the necessity of regularizing the non-convergent integral. Here we study a
reduced version $\bar{A}_\tau$ mod $2\pi i$. We recall a different construction
of $\bar{A}_\tau$ in three steps, due to Matthes, Lochak and the author: first
one defines the reduced {\it elliptic generating series} $\bar{E}_\tau$ which
comes from the reduced Drinfeld associator $\overline{\Phi}_{KZ}$ and whose
coefficients generate the same ring $\bar{R}$ as those of $\bar{A}_\tau$; then
one defines $\Psi$ to be the automorphism of the free associative ring
$\bar{R}\langle\langle a,b\rangle\rangle$ defined by $\Psi(a)=\bar{E}_\tau$ and
$\Psi([a,b])=[a,b]$; finally one shows that the reduced elliptic associator
$\bar{A}_\tau$ is equal to $\Psi\bigl({{ad(b)}\over{e^{ad(b)}-1}}(a)\bigr)$.
Using this construction and mould theory and working with Lie-like versions of
the elliptic generating series and associator, we prove the following results:
(1) a mould satisfies the Fay relations if and only if a closely related mould
satisfies the ""swap circ-neutrality"" relations defining the elliptic
Kashiwara-Vergne Lie algebra $krv_{ell}$, (2) the reduced elliptic generating
series satisfies a family of Fay relations with extremely simple correction
terms coming directly from those of the Drinfeld associator, and (3) the
correction terms for the Fay relations satisfied by the reduced elliptic
associator can be deduced explicitly from these.

prediction performance of sequencing model.
  Setting: Counties from all over the United States.
  Participants: New confirmed cases and deaths have been reported in 3158

  Results: There is a spatial pattern of various classes of travel distances

systems and networks (CompSys). With this manifesto, we draw attention to
CompSys as a vital part of ICT. Among ICT technologies, CompSys covers all the
hardware and all the operational software layers that enable applications; only
application-specific details, and often only application-specific algorithms,
are not part of CompSys. Each of the Top Sectors of the Dutch Economy, each
route in the National Research Agenda, and each of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals pose challenges that cannot be addressed without
groundbreaking CompSys advances. Looking at the 2030-2035 horizon, important
new applications will emerge only when enabled by CompSys developments.
Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, millions moved abruptly online, raising
infrastructure scalability and data sovereignty issues; but governments
processing social data and responsible social networks still require a paradigm
shift in data sovereignty and sharing. AI already requires massive computer
systems which can cost millions per training task, but the current technology
leaves an unsustainable energy footprint including large carbon emissions.
Computational sciences such as bioinformatics, and ""Humanities for all"" and
""citizen data science"", cannot become affordable and efficient until computer
systems take a generational leap. Similarly, the emerging quantum internet
depends on (traditional) CompSys to bootstrap operation for the foreseeable
future. Large commercial sectors, including finance and manufacturing, require
specialized computing and networking or risk becoming uncompetitive. And, at
the core of Dutch innovation, promising technology hubs, deltas, ports, and
smart cities, could see their promise stagger due to critical dependency on
non-European technology.

  Dialogues in Earnings Conference Calls",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.CE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Earnings conference calls are significant information events for volatility
forecasting, which is essential for financial risk management and asset
pricing. Although some recent volatility forecasting models have utilized the
textual content of conference calls, the dialogue structures of conference
calls and company relationships are almost ignored in extant literature. To
bridge this gap, we propose a new model called Temporal Virtual Graph Neural
Network (TVGNN) for volatility forecasting by jointly modeling conference call
dialogues and company networks. Our model differs from existing models in
several important ways. First, we propose to exploit more dialogue structures
by encoding position, utterance, speaker role, and Q\&A segments. Second, we
propose to encode the market states for volatility forecasting by extending the
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Third, we propose a new method for constructing
temporal company networks in which the messages can only flow from temporally
preceding to successive nodes, and extend the Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
for modeling company relationships. We collect conference call transcripts of
S\&P500 companies from 2008 to 2019, and construct a dataset of conference call
dialogues with additional information on dialogue structures and company
networks. Empirical results on our dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
model over competitive baselines for volatility forecasting. We also conduct
supplementary analyses to examine the effectiveness of our model's key
components and interpretability.

scale without limit. The application developer no longer needs to worry about
the up-front investment in a server farm provisioned for a worst-case load
scenario. However, managing cloud deployments requires a sophisticated
framework that can autoscale the infrastructure and guarantee the up-time of
running container images. This paper surveys existing research addressing the
management and orchestration of cloud deployments as well as the modelling
framework to abstract away the low-level details of the host infrastructure. We
investigate blockchain distributed ledgers, quantum computing and Internet of
Things application stacks to show how they can utilize cloud deployments.

researchers are increasingly finding solutions to their scientific curiosities
both financially and computationally feasible. When operating with restricted
power or communications budgets, however, devices can only send
highly-compressed data. Such circumstances are common for devices placed away
from electric grids that can only communicate via satellite, a situation
particularly plausible for environmental sensor networks. These restrictions
can be further complicated by potential variability in the communications
budget, for example a solar-powered device needing to expend less energy when
transmitting data on a cloudy day. We propose a novel, topology-based, lossy
compression method well-equipped for these restrictive yet variable
circumstances. This technique, Topological Signal Compression, allows sending
compressed signals that utilize the entirety of a variable communications
budget. To demonstrate our algorithm's capabilities, we perform entropy
calculations as well as a classification exercise on increasingly topologically
simplified signals from the Free-Spoken Digit Dataset and explore the stability
of the resulting performance against common baselines.

reservoir's non-linearity in a local and unsupervised manner, while the latter
provides the framework for learning in the federated scenario. We evaluate our
approach on real-world datasets from human monitoring, in comparison with the
previous approach for federated ESNs existing in literature. Results show that

  Autocatalytic Sets: Evolution of Biological Coding",,,,,"q-bio.BM physics.hist-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a scenario for the origin of biological coding. In this context,
coding is a semiotic relationship between chemical information stored in one
location that links to chemical information stored in a separate location.
Coding originated by the cooperative interaction of two, originally separate
collectively autocatalytic sets, one for nucleic acids and one for peptides.
When these two sets interacted, a series of RNA-folding-directed processes led
to their joint cooperativity. The amino acyl adenylate, today amino acid-AMP,
was the first covalent association made by these two collectively autocatalytic
sets and solidified their interdependence. This molecule is a palimpsest of
this era, and is a relic of the original semiotic, and thus coding,
relationship between RNA and proteins. More defined coding was driven by
selection pressure to eliminate waste in the collective autocatalytic sets.
Eventually a 1:1 relationship between single amino acids and short RNA pieces
(e.g., three nucleotides) was established, leading to what is today known as
the genetic code. Transfer RNA aminoacylating enzymes, or aaRSs, arose
concomitantly with the advent of specific coding. The two classes of aaRS
enzymes are remnants of the duality of complementary information in two nucleic
acid strands, as originally postulated by Rodin and Ohno. Every stage in the
evolution of coding was driven by the downward selection on the components of a
system to satisfy the Kantian whole. Coding was ultimately forced because there
were at least two chemically distinct classes of polymers needed for open-ended
evolution; systems with only one polymer cannot exhibit this characteristic.
Coding is thus synonymous with life as we know it, and can be thought of as a
phase transition in the history of the universe.
