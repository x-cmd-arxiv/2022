  Diophantine $D(q)$-quintuples",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $C$ be a smooth genus one curve described by a quartic polynomial
equation over the rational field $\mathbb Q$ with $P\in C(\mathbb Q)$. We give
an explicit criterion for the divisibility-by-$2$ of a rational point on the
elliptic curve $(C,P)$. This provides an analogue to the classical criterion of
the divisibility-by-$2$ on elliptic curves described by Weierstrass equations.
  We employ this criterion to investigate the question of extending a rational
$D(q)$-quadruple to a quintuple. We give concrete examples to which we can give
an affirmative answer. One of these results implies that although the rational
$ D(16t+9) $-quadruple $\{t, 16t+8,2 25t+14, 36t+20 \}$ can not be extended to
a polynomial $ D(16t+9) $-quintuple using a linear polynomial, there are
infinitely many rational values of $t$ for which the aforementioned rational $
D(16t+9) $-quadruple can be extended to a rational $ D(16t+9) $-quintuple.
Moreover, these infinitely many values of $t$ are parametrized by the rational
points on a certain elliptic curve of positive Mordell-Weil rank.

  Serious Gains","Accepted at EMNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent model pruning methods have demonstrated the ability to remove
redundant parameters without sacrificing model performance. Common methods
remove redundant parameters according to the parameter sensitivity, a
gradient-based measure reflecting the contribution of the parameters. In this
paper, however, we argue that redundant parameters can be trained to make
beneficial contributions. We first highlight the large sensitivity
(contribution) gap among high-sensitivity and low-sensitivity parameters and
show that the model generalization performance can be significantly improved
after balancing the contribution of all parameters. Our goal is to balance the
sensitivity of all parameters and encourage all of them to contribute equally.
We propose a general task-agnostic method, namely intra-distillation, appended
to the regular training loss to balance parameter sensitivity. Moreover, we
also design a novel adaptive learning method to control the strength of
intra-distillation loss for faster convergence. Our experiments show the strong
effectiveness of our methods on machine translation, natural language
understanding, and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer across up to 48 languages,

semantic segmentation is a task that has not received much attention from the
research community. Only recently, a completion-based 3D method has been
proposed to tackle the problem and formally set up the adaptive scenarios.
However, the proposed pipeline is complex, voxel-based and requires multi-stage
inference, which inhibits it for real-time inference. We propose a range
image-based, effective and efficient method for solving UDA on LiDAR
segmentation. The method exploits class prototypes from the source domain to
pseudo label target domain pixels, which is a research direction showing good
performance in UDA for natural image semantic segmentation. Applying such
approaches to LiDAR scans has not been considered because of the severe domain
shift and lack of pre-trained feature extractor that is unavailable in the
LiDAR segmentation setup. However, we show that proper strategies, including
reconstruction-based pre-training, enhanced prototypes, and selective pseudo
labeling based on distance to prototypes, is sufficient enough to enable the
use of prototypical approaches. We evaluate the performance of our method on
the recently proposed LiDAR segmentation UDA scenarios. Our method achieves
remarkable performance among contemporary methods.

within the framework of turbulent core accretion (TCA) theory, to estimate key
protostellar properties. Here, we release the sedcreator python package that
carries out these methods. The SEDs are generally well fitted by the TCA
models, from which we infer initial core masses $M_c$ ranging from

the dust coma. Observations with the IRAM 30 m were undertaken in 2007, 2010,
2011, and 2021 to monitor the CO production rate and to search for HCN.
Modeling was performed to constrain the size of the sublimating icy grains and
to derive the dust production rate. HCN is detected for the first time in comet
29P (at 5$\sigma$ in the line area). H$_2$O is detected as well, but not
NH$_3$. H$_2$O and HCN line shapes differ strongly from the CO line shape,
indicating that these two species are released from icy grains. CO production
rates are in the range (2.9-5.6) $\times$ 10$^{28}$ s$^{-1}$ (1400--2600 kg
s$^{-1}$). A correlation between the CO production rate and coma brightness is
observed, as is a correlation between CO and H$_2$O production. The correlation
obtained between the excess of CO production and excess of dust brightness with
respect to the quiescent state is similar to that established for the
continuous activity of comet Hale-Bopp. The measured $Q$(H$_2$O)/$Q$(CO) and
$Q$(HCN)/$Q$(CO) production rate ratios are 10.0 $\pm$ 1.5 % and 0.12 $\pm$

the effective radius of the nucleus, $\sim$ 31 $\pm$ 3 km. The inferred dust
mass-loss rates during quiescent phases are in the range 30-120 kg s$^{-1}$,
indicating a dust-to-gas mass ratio $<$ 0.1 during quiescent activity. We
conclude that strong local heterogeneities exist on the surface of 29P, with
quenched dust activity from most of the surface, but not in outbursting

on SNLI, while also identifying the exact hypothesis spans that are responsible
for each model prediction. Using the e-SNLI human explanations, we verify that
our model makes sensible decisions at a span level, despite not using any span
labels during training. We can further improve model performance and span-level
decisions by using the e-SNLI explanations during training. Finally, our model
is more robust in a reduced data setting. When training with only 1,000
examples, out-of-distribution performance improves on the MNLI matched and
mismatched validation sets by 13% and 16% relative to the baseline. Training
with fewer observations yields further improvements, both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution.

can assist the learning process. While it is common to initialize neural
networks with weights that have been pre-trained on other large data sets,
pre-training on more concise forms of knowledge has rather been overlooked. In
this paper, we propose a novel informed machine learning approach and suggest
to pre-train on prior knowledge. Formal knowledge representations, e.g. graphs
or equations, are first transformed into a small and condensed data set of
knowledge prototypes. We show that informed pre-training on such knowledge
prototypes (i) speeds up the learning processes, (ii) improves generalization
capabilities in the regime where not enough training data is available, and
(iii) increases model robustness. Analyzing which parts of the model are
affected most by the prototypes reveals that improvements come from deeper
layers that typically represent high-level features. This confirms that
informed pre-training can indeed transfer semantic knowledge. This is a novel
effect, which shows that knowledge-based pre-training has additional and
complementary strengths to existing approaches.

deep learning approaches have also been introduced to the phase retrieval
problem recently. These approaches are different from the traditional iterative
optimization methods in that they usually require only one intensity
measurement and can reconstruct phase images in real-time. However, because of
tremendous domain discrepancy, the quality of the reconstructed images given by
these approaches still has much room to improve to meet the general application
requirements. In this paper, we design a novel deep neural network structure
named SiSPRNet for phase retrieval based on a single Fourier intensity
measurement. To effectively utilize the spectral information of the
measurements, we propose a new feature extraction unit using the Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) as the front end. It allows all pixels of the input intensity
image to be considered together for exploring their global representation. The
size of the MLP is carefully designed to facilitate the extraction of the
representative features while reducing noises and outliers. A dropout layer is
also equipped to mitigate the possible overfitting problem in training the MLP.
To promote the global correlation in the reconstructed images, a self-attention
mechanism is introduced to the Up-sampling and Reconstruction (UR) blocks of
the proposed SiSPRNet. These UR blocks are inserted into a residual learning
structure to prevent the weak information flow and vanishing gradient problems
due to their complex layer structure. Extensive evaluations of the proposed
model are performed using different testing datasets of phase-only images and
images with linearly related magnitude and phase. Experiments were conducted on
an optical experimentation platform to understand the performance of different
deep learning methods when working in a practical environment.

Tauri multiple system with the aim of studying the physical origin of the
photometric and spectroscopic variability of the system. The TESS Space
Telescope observed VW Cha between 2019 April 22 and June 19, and we
complemented these data with contemporaneous ground-based $I_CJHK$ band
photometric measurements. In addition, we obtained high-resolution optical
spectra with the VLT/ESPRESSO and the 2.2\,m/FEROS instruments. Analyzing these
data, we found that the TESS light curve shows photometric variations on
timescales from minutes to weeks with a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\sim$0.8
mag. The near-infrared light curves follow the shape of the optical
measurements, however, the peak-to-peak amplitudes are slightly increasing
towards the longer wavelengths. We took spectra in both fainter and brighter
photometric states of the system, allowing us to examine the origin of a
photometric brightening event. Our results show that this brightening event can
be explained by increased accretion. In addition, our spectroscopic data also

solar atmosphere, important in its heating and dynamics. Line profiles were
obtained from various active regions spread across the Sun on a monthly basis

centroid and examined their variation during the solar cycle. The histograms of
the Doppler velocity and centroid show that they behave in six different ways
with respect to the position of rest wavelength. In addition, the shifts in the
centroid were found to be more compared to the Doppler velocity. The variation
of the line width with respect to the Doppler velocity or the centroid mostly
follows a second-degree polynomial. A multicomponent line profile is simulated
to explain the difference in the behavior of the Doppler velocity and the

Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism and observations in order to extract
constraints on various classes of f(Q) models. In particular, we calculate the
deviations that f(Q) terms bring on the freeze-out temperature in comparison to
that of the standard $\Lambda CDM$ evolution, and then we impose the
observational bound on $ |\frac{\delta {T}_f}{{T}_f}|$ to extract constraints
on the involved parameters of the considered models. Concerning the polynomial
model, we show that the exponent parameter should be negative, while for the
power-exponential model and the new hyperbolic tangent - power model we find
that they pass the BBN constraints trivially. Finally, we examine two DGP-like
$f(Q)$ models, and we extract the bounds on their model parameters. Since many
gravitational modifications, although able to describe the late-time evolution
of the Universe, produce too-much modification at early times and thus fall to
pass the BBN confrontation, the fact that $f(Q)$ gravity can safely pass the
BBN constraints is an important advantage of this modified gravity class.

quantified in order to improve the detection and characterization of
exoplanets. In this work, we provide new scaling relations of two
characteristic properties of the brightness fluctuations time series, the
standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the auto-correlation time ($\tau\rm_{eff}$).
This was done by using long time series of 3D stellar atmosphere models at
different metallicities and across the HR diagram, generated with a 3D
radiative hydrodynamical code: the STAGGER code. We compared our synthetic
granulation properties with the values of a large sample of Kepler stars, and
analyzed selected stars with accurate stellar parameters from the Kepler LEGACY
sample. Our 3D models showed that $\sigma\propto\nu\rm_{max}^{-0.567\pm0.012}$
and $\tau\rm_{eff}\propto\nu\rm_{max}^{-0.997\pm0.018}$ for stars at solar
metallicity. We showed that both $\sigma$ and $\tau\rm_{eff}$ decrease with
metallicity, although the metallicity dependence is more significant on
$\sigma$. Unlike previous studies, we found very good agreement between
$\sigma$ from Kepler targets and the 3D models at $\log{g}\leq3.5$, and a good
correlation between the stars and models with $\log{g}\geq3.5$. For
$\tau\rm_{eff}$, we found that the 3D models reproduced well the Kepler LEGACY

  We obtain this result by following the approach of DiPerna-Lions (1989);
first showing global-in-time bounds for the solution of the

adapting Bourgain's invariant measure argument to the quasi-invariance setting.
This allows us to bootstrap almost sure global bounds for the solution of

  Workshop",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Classifier calibration has received recent attention from the machine
learning community due both to its practical utility in facilitating decision
making, as well as the observation that modern neural network classifiers are
poorly calibrated. Much of this focus has been towards the goal of learning
classifiers such that their output with largest magnitude (the ""predicted

outputs does not adequately capture the variety of practical use cases in which
classifiers can aid in decision making. In this work, we argue that more
expressive metrics must be developed that accurately measure calibration error
for the specific context in which a classifier will be deployed. To this end,
we derive a number of different metrics using a generalization of Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) that measure calibration error under different
definitions of reliability. We then provide an extensive empirical evaluation
of commonly used neural network architectures and calibration techniques with
respect to these metrics. We find that: 1) definitions of ECE that focus solely
on the predicted class fail to accurately measure calibration error under a
selection of practically useful definitions of reliability and 2) many common
calibration techniques fail to improve calibration performance uniformly across
ECE metrics derived from these diverse definitions of reliability.

The prevailing approach has each function execute in its own container to
isolate concurrent executions of different functions. However, successive
invocations of the same function commonly reuse the runtime state of a previous
invocation in order to avoid container cold-start delays when invoking a
function. Although efficient, this container reuse has security implications
for functions that are invoked on behalf of differently privileged users or
administrative domains: bugs in a function's implementation, third-party
library, or the language runtime may leak private data from one invocation of
the function to subsequent invocations of the same function.
  Groundhog isolates sequential invocations of a function by efficiently
reverting to a clean state, free from any private data, after each invocation.
The system exploits two properties of typical FaaS platforms: each container
executes at most one function at a time and legitimate functions do not retain
state across invocations. This enables Groundhog to efficiently snapshot and
restore function state between invocations in a manner that is independent of
the programming language/runtime and does not require any changes to existing
functions, libraries, language runtimes, or OS kernels. We describe the design
of Groundhog and its implementation in OpenWhisk, a popular production-grade
open-source FaaS framework. On three existing benchmark suites, Groundhog
isolates sequential invocations with modest overhead on end-to-end latency

confidentiality assurances. Through a novel active learning component
integrated with the federated learning technique, our system continuously
discovers and learns the behavior of new, evolving, and globally-coordinated
cyber threats. We show that CELEST is able to expose attacks that are largely
invisible to individual organizations. For instance, in one challenging attack
scenario with data exfiltration malware, the global model achieves a three-fold
increase in Precision-Recall AUC compared to the local model. We also design a
poisoning detection and mitigation method, DTrust, specifically designed for
federated learning in the collaborative threat detection domain. DTrust
successfully detects poisoning clients using the feedback from participating
clients to investigate and remove them from the training process. We deploy
CELEST on two university networks and show that it is able to detect the
malicious HTTP communication with high precision and low false positive rates.
Furthermore, during its deployment, CELEST detected a set of previously unknown
42 malicious URLs and 20 malicious domains in one day, which were confirmed to

planes) forms the basis of majority of LiDAR data processing tasks. A major
challenge in LiDAR data analysis arises from the irregular nature of LiDAR data
that forces practitioners to either regularize the data using some form of
gridding or utilize a triangular mesh such as triangulated irregular network
(TIN). While there have been a handful applications using LiDAR data as a
connected graph, a principled treatment of utilizing graph-theoretical approach
for LiDAR data modelling is still lacking. In this paper, we try to bridge this
gap by utilizing graphical approach for normal estimation from LiDAR point
clouds. We formulate the normal estimation problem in an optimization
framework, where we find the corresponding normal vector for each LiDAR point
by utilizing its nearest neighbors and simultaneously enforcing a graph
smoothness assumption based on point samples. This is a non-linear constrained
convex optimization problem which can then be solved using projected conjugate
gradient descent to yield an unique solution. As an enhancement to our
optimization problem, we also provide different weighted solutions based on the
dot product of the normals and Euclidean distance between the points. In order
to assess the performance of our proposed normal extraction method and
weighting strategies, we first provide a detailed analysis on repeated randomly
generated datasets with four different noise levels and four different tuning
parameters. Finally, we benchmark our proposed method against existing
state-of-the-art approaches on a large scale synthetic plane extraction
dataset. The code for the proposed approach along with the simulations and
benchmarking is available at

normal data, anomaly detection (AD) is traditionally treated as an unsupervised
problem utilizing only normal samples. However, it has recently been found that
unsupervised image AD can be drastically improved through the utilization of
huge corpora of random images to represent anomalousness; a technique which is
known as Outlier Exposure. In this paper we show that specialized AD learning
methods seem unnecessary for state-of-the-art performance, and furthermore one
can achieve strong performance with just a small collection of Outlier Exposure
data, contradicting common assumptions in the field of AD. We find that
standard classifiers and semi-supervised one-class methods trained to discern
between normal samples and relatively few random natural images are able to
outperform the current state of the art on an established AD benchmark with
ImageNet. Further experiments reveal that even one well-chosen outlier sample
is sufficient to achieve decent performance on this benchmark (79.3% AUC). We
investigate this phenomenon and find that one-class methods are more robust to
the choice of training outliers, indicating that there are scenarios where
these are still more useful than standard classifiers. Additionally, we include
experiments that delineate the scenarios where our results hold. Lastly, no
training samples are necessary when one uses the representations learned by
CLIP, a recent foundation model, which achieves state-of-the-art AD results on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in a zero-shot setting.

obtain the gravity field of both static and rotating masses from the flow field
of STF around static and rotating point sinks. In addition, event horizons and

Then, we compare hydrodynamic forces exerted on a test particle with

document-level revision as one of the next challenges. To go beyond
sentence-level automated grammatical error correction to NLP-based
document-level revision assistant, there are two major obstacles: (1) there are
few public corpora with document-level revisions being annotated by
professional editors, and (2) it is not feasible to elicit all possible

there are infinite possibilities of revision. This paper tackles these
challenges. First, we introduce a new document-revision corpus, TETRA, where
professional editors revised academic papers sampled from the ACL anthology
which contain few trivial grammatical errors that enable us to focus more on
document- and paragraph-level edits such as coherence and consistency. Second,
we explore reference-less and interpretable methods for meta-evaluation that
can detect quality improvements by document revision. We show the uniqueness of
TETRA compared with existing document revision corpora and demonstrate that a
fine-tuned pre-trained language model can discriminate the quality of documents
after revision even when the difference is subtle. This promising result will
encourage the community to further explore automated document revision models

addressed by measuring the distributional treatment effect (DTE), such as
differences in quantiles or tail expectations between treatment groups.
Hypothetically, one can similarly fit conditional quantile regressions in each
treatment group and take their difference, but this would not be robust to
misspecification or provide agnostic best-in-class predictions. We provide a
new robust and model-agnostic methodology for learning the conditional DTE

it can provide the best projection of CDTE onto the regression model class. Our
method is robust in that even if we learn these nuisances nonparametrically at
very slow rates, we can still learn CDTEs at rates that depend on the class
complexity and even conduct inferences on linear projections of CDTEs. We

deflected by massive objects along their travel path. When the lens is massive
enough and the source aligns closely with the line-of-sight to the lens, the
wave undergoes strong lensing, leading to several images with the same
frequency evolution. These images are separated in time, magnified, and can
undergo an overall phase shift. Searches for strongly-lensed gravitational
waves are already ongoing. In essence, such searches look for events
originating from the same sky location and having the same detector frame
parameters. However, the agreement between these quantities can also happen by
chance, leading to an important confusion background. To reduce the overlap
between background and foreground, one can include lensing models, enforcing
the lensing parameters to also be consistent with our expectations. In
principle, such models should decrease the confusion background. However, when
doing realistic searches, one does not know which model is the correct one. The
use of an incorrect model could lead to the non-detection of genuinely lensed
events. In this work, we investigate under realistic conditions how one can
identify lensed events in the unlensed background. We focus on the impact of
the addition of a model for the lens density profile and investigate the effect
of potential errors in the modelling. We show that it is extremely difficult to
identify lensing confidently without the addition of a lens model. We also show
that slight variations in the profile of the lens model are tolerable but a
model with incorrect assumptions about the underlying lens population causes
significant errors compared to assuming no lens model at all. We also suggest
some strategies to improve the confidence in the detection of strong lensing
for gravitational waves.

Additionally, we analyze its interplay with other purely gravitational and
therefore unavoidable DM production mechanisms such as Hawking emission and the
ultraviolet freeze-in. We find that superradiance can significantly increase
the DM density produced by PBHs with respect to the case that only considers
Hawking emission, and hence lower initial PBH densities are required.

obtain the interacting phase diagram for an electronic two-orbital model with
tunable topology in a two dimensional amorphous network. In addition to the
(non-)topological phases that are adiabatically connected to the free fermion

crystalline Mott insulating phases with non-trivial chiral neutral edge modes,
and a fractionalized Anderson insulating phase. The amorphous networks thus
provide a new playground for studying a plethora of exotic states of matter,
and their glassy dynamics, due to the combined effects of non-trivial topology,
disorder, and strong interactions.

  Problem","34 pages, 1 figure",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probabilities in eternal inflation are traditionally defined as limiting
frequency distributions, but a unique and unambiguous probability measure
remains elusive. In this paper, we present a different approach, based on
Bayesian reasoning. Our starting point is the master equation governing vacuum
dynamics, which describes a random walk on the network of vacua. Our
probabilities require two pieces of prior information, both pertaining to
initial conditions: a prior density $\rho(t)$ for the time of nucleation, and a
prior probability $p_\alpha$ for the ancestral vacuum. For ancestral vacua, we
advocate the uniform prior as a conservative choice, though our conclusions are
fairly insensitive to this choice. For the time of nucleation, we argue that a
uniform prior is consistent with the time-translational invariance of the
master equation and represents the minimally-informative choice. The resulting
predictive probabilities coincide with Bousso's ""holographic"" prior
probabilities and are closely related to Garriga and Vilenkin's ""comoving""
probabilities. Despite making the least informative priors, these probabilities
are surprisingly predictive. They favor vacua whose surrounding landscape
topography is that of a deep funnel, akin to the folding funnels of
naturally-occurring proteins. They predict that we exist during the approach to
near-equilibrium, much earlier than the mixing time for the landscape. We also
consider a volume-weighted $\rho(t)$, which amounts to weighing vacua by
physical volume. The predictive probabilities in this case coincide with the
GSVW measure. The Bayesian framework allows us to compare the plausibility of
the uniform-time and volume-weighted hypotheses to explain our data by
computing the Bayesian evidence for each. We argue, under general and plausible
assumptions, that posterior odds overwhelmingly favor the uniform-time
hypothesis.

area over $15\,000 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$ in the redshift range $0.9<z<1.8\ -$ will
provide a sample of tens of thousands of cosmic voids. This paper explores for
the first time the constraining power of the void size function on the
properties of dark energy (DE) from a survey mock catalogue, the official
Euclid Flagship simulation. We identify voids in the Flagship light-cone, which
closely matches the features of the upcoming Euclid spectroscopic data set. We
model the void size function considering a state-of-the art methodology: we
rely on the volume conserving (Vdn) model, a modification of the popular Sheth
& van de Weygaert model for void number counts, extended by means of a linear
function of the large-scale galaxy bias. We find an excellent agreement between
model predictions and measured mock void number counts. We compute updated
forecasts for the Euclid mission on DE from the void size function and provide
reliable void number estimates to serve as a basis for further forecasts of
cosmological applications using voids. We analyse two different cosmological
models for DE: the first described by a constant DE equation of state
parameter, $w$, and the second by a dynamic equation of state with coefficients
$w_0$ and $w_a$. We forecast $1\sigma$ errors on $w$ lower than $10\%$, and we
estimate an expected figure of merit (FoM) for the dynamical DE scenario
$\mathrm{FoM}_{w_0,w_a} = 17$ when considering only the neutrino mass as
additional free parameter of the model. The analysis is based on conservative
assumptions to ensure full robustness, and is a pathfinder for future
enhancements of the technique. Our results showcase the impressive constraining
power of the void size function from the Euclid spectroscopic sample, both as a
stand-alone probe, and to be combined with other Euclid cosmological probes.

determination of the reionization history. Due to the intervening intergalactic
medium (IGM), the possibility of observing LyC photons directly in the epoch of
reionization is highly unlikely. For this reason, multiple indirect probes of
LyC escape have been identified, some of which are used to identify
low-redshift LyC leakers (e.g. O32), while others are primarily useful at $z>6$
(e.g. [OIII]/[CII] far infrared emission). The flux ratio of the resonant MgII
doublet emission at 2796$\dot{\rm A}$ and 2803$\dot{\rm A}$ as well as the MgII
optical depth have recently been proposed as ideal diagnostics of LyC leakage
that can be employed at $z>6$ with JWST. Using state-of-the-art cosmological
radiation hydrodynamics simulations post-processed with CLOUDY and
resonant-line radiative transfer, we test whether MgII is indeed a useful probe
of LyC leakage. Our simulations indicate that the majority of bright,
star-forming galaxies with high LyC escape fractions are expected to be MgII
emitters rather than absorbers at $z=6$. However, we find that the MgII doublet
flux ratio is a more sensitive indicator of dust rather than neutral hydrogen,
limiting its use as a LyC leakage indicator to only galaxies in the optically
thin regime. Given its resonant nature, we show that MgII will be an exciting
probe of the complex kinematics in high-redshift galaxies in upcoming JWST
observations.

techniques. They also have a wide range of applications in the field of
spintronics, particularly in developing new technologies for memory storage

flexible multi-label classification framework that can correctly classify

identifying the different phases reliably and early in the formation process.
Thus, the CNN can significantly speed up the large-scale simulations for 3D
materials that have been the bottleneck for quantitative studies so far.
Moreover, this approach can be applied to the identification of mixed states

populations than in the Milky Way. At fixed redshift, only a small range of
IMFs are found, with the typical IMF becoming progressively top-heavier with
increasing redshift. Additionally, subpopulations of ULIRGs, quiescent- and
star-forming galaxies are compared with predictions of stellar population
feedback and show clear qualitative similarities to the evolution of dust

groups and clusters with $M_{\rm 500crit}$ between $10^{12}$ and $2\times
10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$ in IllustrisTNG. We explore the similarities and
differences between IllustrisTNG predictions of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and
X-ray scaling relations with mass. We find a median hydrostatic mass bias $b =
0.125 \pm 0.003$ for $M_{\rm 500crit}$ $>10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$. The bias
increases to $b = 0.17 \pm 0.004$ when masses are derived from synthetic X-ray
observations. We model how different underlying assumptions about the
dependence of $Y_{\rm X}$ on halo mass can generate biases in the observed
$Y_{\rm SZ} - M_{Y_{\rm X}}$ scaling relation. In particular, the simplifying
assumption that $Y_{\rm X} - M_{\rm tot}$ is self-similar at all mass scales
largely hides the break in $Y_{\rm SZ} - M_{\rm tot}$ and overestimates $Y_{\rm
SZ}$ at galaxy and groups scales. We show that calibrating the $Y_{\rm X}-$mass
proxy using a new model for a smoothly broken power law reproduces the true
underlying $Y_{\rm SZ} - M_{\rm tot}$ scaling relation with high accuracy.
Moreover, $M_{Y_{\rm X}}$ estimates calibrated with this method lead to $Y_{\rm
SZ} - M_{Y_{\rm X}}$ predictions that are not biased by the presence of lower
mass clusters or galaxy groups in the sample. Finally, we show that our
smoothly broken power law model provides a robust way to derive the $Y_{\rm

multi-messenger follow-ups. In all cases, the neutrino observation occurred
O(100) days after the maximum of the optical-ultraviolet (OUV) luminosity. We
discuss unified fully time-dependent interpretations of the neutrino signals
where the neutrino delays are not a statistical effect, but rather the
consequence of a physical scale of the post-disruption system. Noting that
X-rays flares and infrared (IR) dust echoes have been observed in all cases, we
consider three models in which quasi-isotropic neutrino emission is due to the
interactions of accelerated protons of moderate, medium, and ultra-high
energies with X-rays, OUV, and IR photons, respectively. We find that the
neutrino time delays can be well described in the X-ray model assuming magnetic
confinement of protons in a calorimetric approach if the unobscured X-ray
luminosity is roughly constant over time, and in the IR model, where the delay
is directly correlated with the time evolution of the echo luminosity (for
which a model is developed here). The OUV model exhibits the highest neutrino
production efficiency. In all three models, the highest neutrino fluence is
predicted for AT2019aalc, due to its high estimated supermassive black hole
mass and low redshift. All models result in diffuse neutrino fluxes that are
consistent with observations.

angular dependence of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) at constant magnetic
fields ($H$) in the range of 50 to 100 kOe. Application of field below the
critical value (2.5 kOe), yielded negative SMR and the $H$-evolution of
normalized SMR exhibited a negative gradient. Further, an increase in the $H$
resulted in the positive slope of normalized SMR Vs. $H$ and later at higher
$H$ around 14 kOe, a crossover from negative to positive SMR was observed. We
employed a simple model for estimating the equilibrium magnetic configuration
and computed the SMR modulation at various values of $H$. We argue that the
tilting of the cone is dominant and in turn responsible for the observed nature
of SMR below 2.5 kOe while, the closing of the cone-angle is pronounced at
higher fields causing a reversal in sign of the SMR from negative to positive.
Importantly, SMR experiments revealed that a change in the helicity with a
reversal of the magnetic field has no influence on the observed SMR.
Longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) signal was measured to be 500 nV at 280
K, under application of thermal gradient, $\Delta T = 23$ K and field, 60 kOe.
The observed LSSE signal, originating from pure magnon spin current, showed a
similar $H$-dependent behavior as that of the magnetization of SCFO. Our
detailed spin transport studies on polycrystalline SCFO|Pt heterostructure
demonstrate high tunability of the amplitude and the sign of the SMR,
highlighting its potential for novel spintronic devices such as SMR-based spin
valves and voltage-controlled spin transport devices.

the last decade called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a
probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems
endowed with a particular partition (i.e., into particles), where the internal
states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode
the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These
tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if
they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of
their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the
constraints, forces, potentials, and other quantities determining the dynamics
of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs
(i.e., on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in
the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways
in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e.,
path-tracking, mode-tracking, and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality
between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy
principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss
its implications.

$\langle\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x},t)\mathcal{O}(0,0)\rangle$ in chaotic quantum
many-body systems. These correlators show universal structure at late times,
determined by the dominant operator-space Feynman trajectories for the evolving
operator $\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x},t)$. The relevant trajectories involve the
operator contracting to a point at both the initial and final time and so are
structurally different from those dominating the out-of-time-order correlator.
In the absence of conservation laws, correlations decay exponentially:
$\langle\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x},t)\mathcal{O}(0,0)\rangle\sim\exp(-s_\mathrm{eq}
r(\mathbf{v}) t)$, where $\mathbf{v}= \mathbf{x}/ t$ defines a spacetime ray,
and $r(\mathbf{v})$ is an associated decay rate. We express $r(\mathbf{v})$ in
terms of cost functions for various spacetime structures. In 1+1D, operator
histories can show a phase transition at a critical ray velocity $v_c$, where
$r(\mathbf{v})$ is nonanalytic. At low $v$, the dominant Feynman histories are
""fat"": the operator grows to a size of order $t^\alpha\gg 1$ before contracting
to a point again. At high $v$ the trajectories are ""thin"": the operator always
remains of order-one size. In a Haar-random unitary circuit, this transition
maps to a simple binding transition for a pair of random walks (the two spatial
boundaries of the operator). In higher dimensions, thin trajectories always
dominate. We discuss ways to extract the butterfly velocity $v_B$ from the
time-ordered correlator, rather than the OTOC. Correlators in the random
circuit may alternatively be computed with an effective Ising-like model: a
special feature of the Ising weights for the Haar brickwork circuit gives
$v_c=v_B$. This work addresses lattice models, but also suggests the
possibility of morphological phase transitions for real-time Feynman diagrams
in quantum field theories.

thermal dark matter of a mass ranging from a few MeV to a few GeV can be
realized with a dark-sector $U(1)$, relies on a small kinetic mixing term
between this dark $U(1)$ and the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge. It is
well-known that kinetic mixing of the right magnitude can be generated at one
loop by the inclusion of ""portal matter"" fields which are charged under both
the dark $U(1)$ and the SM hypercharge, and it has been previously argued on
phenomenological grounds that fermionic portal matter fields must exhibit a
specific set of characteristics: They must be vector-like and have the same
Standard Model group representations as existing SM fermions. A natural
explanation for the presence of dark $U(1)$-charged copies of SM fermions would
be to enlarge the dark gauge group and embed the SM and the portal matter into
a single dark multiplet, however, previous works in this direction require
significant ad hoc additions to ensure that the portal matter fields are
vector-like while the SM fields are chiral, and rely on complicated dark Higgs
sectors to realize the appropriate symmetry breaking. In this paper, we argue
that a model with large extra dimensions can easily generate chiral SM fermions
and vector-like portal matter from a single dark bulk multiplet, while allowing
for a far simpler dark Higgs sector. We present a minimal construction of this
""Kaluza-Klein (KK) portal matter"" and explore its phenomenology at the LHC,
noting that even our simple realization exhibits signatures unique from those
of more conventional models with large extra dimensions and 4-D portal matter.
Generically, the portal matter sector fields will be much lighter than the
other KK fields in the model, so the portal matter sector has the potential to
be the first observable experimental signature of an extra dimension.

dimension two and three, including both minimal and partial crepant resolutions
of Kleinian singularities, as well as arbitrary flopping 3-fold contractions

general: in each such setting, we prove that all objects in the associated null
category with no negative Ext groups are the image, under the action of an
appropriate braid or pure braid group, of some object in the heart of a bounded
t-structure. The corollary is that all objects which admit no negative Exts,
and for which the self-Hom space is one dimensional, are the images of the
simples. A variation on this argument goes further, and classifies all bounded
t-structures. There are multiple geometric, topological and algebraic
consequences, primarily to autoequivalences and stability conditions. Our main
new technique also extends into representation theory, and we establish that in
the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which is silting discrete,
every object with no negative Ext groups lies in the heart of a bounded
t-structure. As a consequence, every semibrick complex can be completed to a
simple minded collection.

in a specific applicative context. This is especially the case when the
annotation consists in binary masks covering object instances. Our work
proposes to delineate instances in three steps, based on a semi-automatic
approach: (1) the extreme points of an object (left-most, right-most, top,
bottom pixels) are manually defined, thereby providing the object bounding-box,
(2) a universal automatic segmentation tool like Deep Extreme Cut is used to
turn the bounded object into a segmentation mask that matches the extreme
points; and (3) the predicted mask is manually corrected. Various strategies
are then investigated to balance the human manual annotation resources between
bounding-box definition and mask correction, including when the correction of
instance masks is prioritized based on their overlap with other instance
bounding-boxes, or the outcome of an instance segmentation model trained on a
partially annotated dataset. Our experimental study considers a teamsport
player segmentation task, and measures how the accuracy of the Panoptic-Deeplab
instance segmentation model depends on the human annotation resources
allocation strategy. It reveals that the sole definition of extreme points
results in a model accuracy that would require up to 10 times more resources if
the masks were defined through fully manual delineation of instances. When
targeting higher accuracies, prioritizing the mask correction among the
training set instances is also shown to save up to 80\% of correction
annotation resources compared to a systematic frame by frame correction of
instances, for a same trained instance segmentation model accuracy.

  with an Inner Envelope",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, Su and Cook proposed a dimension reduction technique called the
inner envelope which can be substantially more efficient than the original
envelope or existing dimension reduction techniques for multivariate
regression. However, their technique relied on a linear model with normally
distributed error, which may be violated in practice. In this work, we propose
a semiparametric variant of the inner envelope that does not rely on the linear
model nor the normality assumption. We show that our proposal leads to globally
and locally efficient estimators of the inner envelope spaces. We also present
a computationally tractable algorithm to estimate the inner envelope. Our
simulations and real data analysis show that our method is both robust and
efficient compared to existing dimension reduction methods in a diverse array
of settings.

BIE formulation that leverages the simplicity of the free-space Green function

integrals are here treated via the window Green function method. The windowing
approximation together with a finite-rank operator correction -- used to
properly impose the Rayleigh radiation condition -- yield a robust second-kind
BIE that produces super-algebraically convergent solutions throughout the
spectrum, including at the challenging Rayleigh-Wood anomalies. The corrected
windowed BIE can be discretized by means of off-the-shelf Nystr\""om and
boundary element methods, and it leads to linear systems suitable for iterative
linear-algebra solvers as well as standard fast matrix-vector product
algorithms. A variety of numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and

stress correlations in soft colloidal gel materials which support tensile and
compressive forces as well as finite rolling torque, as a function of system
pressure. Similar to previous studies on frictional granular matter with only
compressive forces and without any rolling torque, the full stress
autocorrelation matrix is dictated by the pressure and torque autocorrelations
due to mechanical balance and material isotropy constraints. Surprisingly, it
is observed that the gel materials do not behave as a normal elastic solid
close to the gel point as assumed loosely in the literature because the real
space pressure fluctuations decay slower than the normal. We also demonstrate
that at low pressure the fractal like structural correlation determines the
pressure fluctuations and this is manifested in the real space in terms of
inhomogeneous and anisotropic force networks formed due to large voids. Far
away from the gel point, as the voids collapse under compression, the force
chain network becomes homogeneous and isotropic and the pressure fluctuations
become normal leading to normal elastic decay at long range, behaving similar
to frictionless granular matter and glass. We also observe that the torque
autocorrelation is not hyperuniform in the presence of rolling resistance close
to the gel point. Furthermore, we link the abnormal pressure fluctuations to
the non-hyperuniform behaviour of the system with respect to the local packing
fraction fluctuations, thus relating the deviations from the normal elastic
behaviour across various non-equilibrium systems under a common framework.

Encoding is performed on temporally-overlapped windows within the time series

cross-window attention is computed between base tokens in each window and
fringe tokens from neighboring windows. To gradually transition from local to
global representations, the extent of window overlap and thereby number of

the limited transaction throughput of blockchains. Nevertheless, PCNs suffer
themselves from a throughput limitation due to the capital constraints of their
channels. A similar dependence on high capital is also found in inter-bank
payment settlements, where the so-called netting technique is used to mitigate
liquidity demands.
  In this work, we alleviate this limitation by introducing the notion of
transaction aggregation: instead of executing transactions sequentially through
a PCN, we enable senders to aggregate multiple transactions and execute them
simultaneously to benefit from several amounts that may ""cancel out"". Two
direct advantages of our proposal is the decrease in intermediary fees paid by
senders as well as the obfuscation of the transaction data from the
intermediaries.
  We formulate the transaction aggregation as a computational problem, a
generalization of the Bank Clearing Problem. We present a generic framework for
the transaction aggregation execution, and thereafter we propose Wiser as an
implementation of this framework in a specific hub-based setting. To overcome
the NP-hardness of the transaction aggregation problem, in Wiser we propose a
fixed-parameter linear algorithm for a special case of transaction aggregation
as well as the Bank Clearing Problem. Wiser can also be seen as a modern
variant of the Hawala money transfer system, as well as a decentralized
implementation of the overseas remittance service of Wise.

unbounded growth, many biological self-assembly processes are self-limited.
That is, the assembled structures have one or more finite dimensions that are
much larger than the size scale of the individual monomers. In many such cases,
the finite dimension is selected by a preferred curvature of the monomers,
which leads to self-closure of the assembly. In this article, we study an
example class of self-closing assemblies: cylindrical tubules that assemble
from triangular monomers. By combining kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, free
energy calculations, and simple theoretical models, we show that a range of
programmable size scales can be targeted by controlling the intricate balance
between the preferred curvature of the monomers and their interaction
strengths. However, their assembly is kinetically controlled - the tubule
morphology is essentially fixed shortly after closure, resulting in a
distribution of tubule widths that is significantly broader than the
equilibrium distribution. We develop a simple kinetic model based on this
observation and the underlying free-energy landscape of assembling tubules that
quantitatively describes the distributions. Our results are consistent with
recent experimental observations of tubule assembly from triangular DNA origami

coherent states formalism, to study the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in a
ferromagentic/normal metal junction. Due to the interface interaction, the
FMR-generated spin current is injected from the magnetic insulator to the
normal metal, the so-called spin pumping. Ordinarily, ferromagnetic models are
described by bosonic representation or phenomenological theories; however, in a
coherent magnetization state, the SCHA is the more natural choice to treat FMR
problems. Over the years, the SCHA has successfully applied to investigate
ferro and antiferromagnetism in a wide range of scenarios. The main point of
the SCHA formalism involves the adoption of a quadratic model for which
corrections are included through temperature-dependent renormalization
parameters. Therefore, the SCHA is an efficient method for determining the
properties of magnetically ordered phases. Using the SCHA, we obtained the
temperature dependence of FMR-driven spin pumping. In addition, we found the
spin-mix conductance, the additional damping from the angular momentum

use of visual observations, which are universal representations across
languages. In this work, we investigate the potential of using not only visual
observations but also pretrained language-image models for enabling a more
efficient and robust UWT. Specifically, we develop a novel UWT method dubbed
Word Alignment using Language-Image Pretraining (WALIP), which leverages visual
observations via the shared embedding space of images and texts provided by
CLIP models (Radford et al., 2021). WALIP has a two-step procedure. First, we
retrieve word pairs with high confidences of similarity, computed using our
proposed image-based fingerprints, which define the initial pivot for the word
alignment. Second, we apply our robust Procrustes algorithm to estimate the
linear mapping between two embedding spaces, which iteratively corrects and
refines the estimated alignment. Our extensive experiments show that WALIP
improves upon the state-of-the-art performance of bilingual word alignment for
a few language pairs across different word embeddings and displays great
robustness to the dissimilarity of language pairs or training corpora for two
word embeddings.

  Association Studies",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Genomic data are subject to various sources of confounding, such as
demographic variables, biological heterogeneity, and batch effects. To identify
genomic features associated with a variable of interest in the presence of
confounders, the traditional approach involves fitting a confounder-adjusted
regression model to each genomic feature, followed by multiplicity correction.
This study shows that the traditional approach was sub-optimal and proposes a
new two-dimensional false discovery rate control framework (2dFDR+) that
provides significant power improvement over the conventional method and applies
to a wide range of settings. 2dFDR+ uses marginal independence test statistics
as auxiliary information to filter out less promising features, and FDR control
is performed based on conditional independence test statistics in the remaining
features. 2dFDR+ provides (asymptotically) valid inference from samples in
settings where the conditional distribution of the genomic variables given the
covariate of interest and the confounders is arbitrary and completely unknown.
To achieve this goal, our method requires the conditional distribution of the
covariate given the confounders to be known or can be estimated from the data.
We develop a new procedure to simultaneously select the two cutoff values for
the marginal and conditional independence test statistics. 2dFDR+ is proved to
offer asymptotic FDR control and dominate the power of the traditional
procedure. Promising finite sample performance is demonstrated via extensive
simulations and real data applications.

applications like machine learning, scientific simulations, and data mining.
Hence, automated code generation and performance optimizations for tensor
algebra kernels are paramount. Recent advancements such as the Tensor Algebra
Compiler (TACO) greatly generalize and automate the code generation for tensor
algebra expressions. However, the code generated by TACO for many important
tensor computations remains suboptimal due to the absence of a scheduling
directive to support transformations such as distribution/fusion.
  This paper extends TACO's scheduling space to support kernel
distribution/loop fusion in order to reduce asymptotic time complexity and
improve locality of complex tensor algebra computations. We develop an
intermediate representation (IR) for tensor operations called branched
iteration graph which specifies breakdown of the computation into smaller ones
(kernel distribution) and then fuse (loop fusion) outermost dimensions of the
loop nests, while the innermost dimensions are distributed, to increase data
locality. We describe exchanges of intermediate results between space iteration
spaces, transformation in the IR, and its programmatic invocation. Finally, we
show that the transformation can be used to optimize sparse tensor kernels. Our
results show that this new transformation significantly improves the

focus on improving CBS by reducing the size of this tree through various
strategies with few methods modifying the low level planner. Typically low
level planners in existing CBS methods use an unweighted cost-to-go heuristic,
with suboptimal CBS methods also using a conflict heuristic to help the high
level search. In this paper, we show that, contrary to prevailing CBS beliefs,
a weighted cost-to-go heuristic can be used effectively alongside the conflict
heuristic in two possible variants. In particular, one of these variants can
obtain large speedups, 2-100x, across several scenarios and suboptimal CBS
methods. Importantly, we discover that performance is related not to the
weighted cost-to-go heuristic but rather to the relative conflict heuristic
weight's ability to effectively balance low-level and high-level work, implying
that existing suboptimal CBS work misses this subtlety. Additionally, to the

innovation contributing to the combinatorial knowledge network: (i) conceptual
innovation associated with the emergence of new concepts and entities (measured
as the entry of new MeSH); and (ii) recombinant innovation, associated with the
emergence of new combinations, which itself consists of two types: peripheral
(i.e., combinations involving new knowledge) and core (combinations comprised

is whether examining triplet and quartet combinations, in addition to the more
traditional dyadic or pairwise combinations, provide evidence of any new
phenomena associated with higher-order combinations. Analysis of the size,
growth, and coverage of combinatorial innovation yield results that are largely
independent of the combination order, thereby suggesting that the common dyadic
approach is sufficient to capture essential phenomena. Our main results are
twofold: (a) despite the persistent addition of new MeSH terms, the network is
densifying over time meaning that scholars are increasingly exploring and
realizing the vast space of all knowledge combinations; and (b) conceptual
innovation is increasingly concentrated within single research articles, a

larger ones showing strong generalization performance with a graph neural

the mass function. In particular, a consequence is that the curvature strength
of the singularity cannot be smoothed away.

also being sufficiently accurate and producing consistent generation dispatches

of OPF, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the OPF problem in question
may be written, and in parallel the LMPs of generators and loads may be
expressed in terms of the OPF Lagrangian multipliers. Also, taking advantage of
the practical fact that many of the Lagrangian multipliers associated with
lines will be zero (thermal limits are not binding), we build and train an ML
scheme which maps flexible resources (loads and renewables) to the binding
lines, and supplement it with an efficient power-grid aware linear map to
optimal dispatch and LMPs. The scheme is validated and illustrated on IEEE

We find that the AGN contribution to L_IR increases as a function of AGN power

note that L_IR,SF does not correlate with AGN power; the mean star formation

range from ~6 Msun/yr at z~0 to a plateau of <200 Msun/yr at z~2.6. Our results
indicate that the accuracy of far-IR emission as a proxy for SFR decreases with
increasing AGN luminosity. We show that, at any given redshift, observed trends
between infrared luminosity (whether monochromatic or total) and AGN power (in

two components: (A) the infrared emission from star-formation, uncorrelated

Rather than requiring the matrix to act in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, we
extend its action to a suitable distributional triple $\mathcal{D} \subset
\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{D}_-$ and restrict it to its maximal domain in
$\mathcal{H}$. The crucial point in our approach is the choice of the spaces
$\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}_-$ which are essentially determined by the Schur
complement of the matrix. We show spectral equivalence between the resulting
operator matrix in $\mathcal{H}$ and its Schur complement, which allows to pass
from a suitable representation of the Schur complement (e.g. by generalised
form methods) to a representation of the operator matrix. We thereby generalise
classical spectral equivalence results imposing standard dominance patterns.
  The abstract results are applied to damped wave equations with possibly

expensive. Prior work proposes several neural architecture search (NAS) methods
that employ performance predictors (e.g., surrogate models) to address this
issue; however, analysis has been limited to homogeneous models that use fixed
dimensionality throughout the network. This leads to sub-optimal architectures.
To address this limitation, we propose a suite of heterogeneous and flexible
models, namely FlexiBERT, that have varied encoder layers with a diverse set of
possible operations and different hidden dimensions. For better-posed surrogate
modeling in this expanded design space, we propose a new graph-similarity-based

quickly train and use a neural surrogate model to converge to the optimal
architecture. A comprehensive set of experiments shows that the proposed
policy, when applied to the FlexiBERT design space, pushes the performance
frontier upwards compared to traditional models. FlexiBERT-Mini, one of our
proposed models, has 3% fewer parameters than BERT-Mini and achieves 8.9%
higher GLUE score. A FlexiBERT model with equivalent performance as the best
homogeneous model achieves 2.6x smaller size. FlexiBERT-Large, another proposed

intersection and union of bounding boxes, respectively. These are
straightforward to compute on the CPU using a sequential algorithm, but an
efficient, parallel GPU algorithm is more elusive. This paper presents a fast
and practical solution, with a new algorithm for the classic parentheses
matching problem at its core. The core algorithm is presented abstractly (in
terms of a PRAM abstraction), then with a concrete mapping to the thread,
workgroup, and dispatch levels of real GPU hardware. The algorithm is
implemented portably using compute shaders, and performance results show a
dramatic speedup over a sequential CPU version, and indeed a reasonable
fraction of maximum theoretical throughput of the GPU hardware. The immediate
motivating application is 2D rendering, but the algorithms generalize to other
domains, and the core parentheses matching problem has other applications
including parsing.

different data models, and no standard specification exists for them. In this
paper, a generic approach for evolving NoSQL and relational schemas is
presented, which is based on the U-Schema unified data model that includes
aggregation and reference relationships, and structural variations. For this
data model, we introduce a taxonomy of schema changes for all the U-Schema
elements, which is implemented by creating the Orion database-independent
language. We will show how Orion can be used to automatically generate
evolution scripts for a set of NoSQL databases, and the feasibility of each
schema operation will be analyzed through the performance results obtained. The
taxonomy has been formally validated by means of Alloy, and two case studies
show the application of Orion.

defined by the change in energy from a steady-state to another state under a

is regarded as thermodynamic work. We employ a system--bath model that involves
time-dependent perturbations in both the system and the system--bath

field that describes the operation of an adiabatic wall between the system and
the bath. Thermodynamic--work diagrams for external fields and their conjugate

done for the system in the cycle. We find that the thermodynamic efficiency of
this machine is zero because the field for the isothermal processes acts as a
refrigerator, whereas that for the adiabatic wall acts as a heat engine. This
is a numerical manifestation of the Kelvin--Planck statement, which states that
it is impossible to derive mechanical effects from a single heat source. These

the second law of thermodynamics is only valid when the work involved in the

spin angular momentum. In contrast, the off-diagonal components of the spin
Hall conductivity are non-zero and scale with the carrier velocity (and the
effective $g$-factor) when spin current consists of the flow of spin magnetic
moment. We derive analytical formula of the conductivity, carrier mobility and
the spin Hall conductivity to compare with experiments. In experiments, we use
Bi as a model system that can be characterized by the Dirac Hamiltonian. Te and
Sn are doped into Bi to vary the electron and hole concentration, respectively.
We find the spin Hall conductivity ($\sigma_\mathrm{SH}$) takes a maximum near
the Dirac point and decreases with increasing carrier density ($n$). The sign
of $\sigma_\mathrm{SH}$ is the same regardless of the majority carrier type.
The spin Hall mobility, proportional to $\sigma_\mathrm{SH}/n$, increases with
increasing carrier mobility with a scaling coefficient of $\sim$1.4. These
features can be accounted for quantitatively using the derived analytical

off the surface, we introduce a notion of 'surface Hadamard' state on the CCR
algebra of the surface. We conjecture that, for a given such set of classical
Cauchy data with a surface Hadamard state satisfying the semiclassical
constraint equations, the initial value problem will be well posed. We present
similar conjectures for a semiclassical scalars model and semiclassical
electrodynamics. Moreover, partly inspired by work of Parker and Simon in 1993,
we define semiclassical gravity `physical solutions' to be those that are
(jointly smooth) functions of $\hbar$ and of coordinates continuous in $\hbar$
at $\hbar =0$. We conjecture that for such solutions the second and third time
derivatives of the metric off the surface need not be specified, but rather
will be determined by that continuity condition. Assuming the initial value
conjecture for such physical solutions holds, and that a stochastic rule were
available which leads to quantum state collapses occurring on
(non-intersecting) random Cauchy surfaces, we discuss the well-posedness of
semiclassical gravity with stochastic quantum state collapses. We also discuss
two notions of approximate physical semiclassical solutions (both with and
without collapses): Namely solutions to order $\hbar$ (first discussed by
Parker and Simon in 1993) and solutions to order $\hbar^0$. We point out that
the latter do not require higher derivative terms or Hadamard subtractions, but
that nevertheless order $\hbar^0$ semiclassical gravity is a distinct theory

reduction but are ill-suited for low data regimes. Conversely, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) is data-efficient but is limited to linear
dimensionality reduction, posing a problem when data exhibits inherent
nonlinearity. This presents a challenge in various scientific and engineering
domains such as the nanophotonic component design, where data exhibits
nonlinear features while being expensive to obtain due to costly real
measurements or resource-consuming solutions of partial differential equations.
  To address this difficulty, we propose a technique that harnesses the best of
both worlds: an autoencoder that leverages PCA to perform well on scarce
nonlinear data. Specifically, we outline a numerically robust PCA-based
initialization of AE, which, together with the parameterized ReLU activation
function, allows the training process to start from an exact PCA solution and
improve upon it. A synthetic example is presented first to study the effects of
data nonlinearity and size on the performance of the proposed method. We then
evaluate our method on several nanophotonic component design problems where
obtaining useful data is expensive. To demonstrate universality, we also apply
it to tasks in other scientific domains: a benchmark breast cancer dataset and
a gene expression dataset.
  We show that our proposed approach is substantially better than both PCA and
randomly initialized AE in the majority of low-data regime cases we consider,

  Distillation","Accepted to KDD 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be expressive for
modeling graph-structured data. Nevertheless, the over-stacked architecture of
deep graph models makes it difficult to deploy and rapidly test on mobile or
embedded systems. To compress over-stacked GNNs, knowledge distillation via a
teacher-student architecture turns out to be an effective technique, where the
key step is to measure the discrepancy between teacher and student networks
with predefined distance functions. However, using the same distance for graphs
of various structures may be unfit, and the optimal distance formulation is
hard to determine. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adversarial
Knowledge Distillation framework for graph models named GraphAKD, which
adversarially trains a discriminator and a generator to adaptively detect and
decrease the discrepancy. Specifically, noticing that the well-captured
inter-node and inter-class correlations favor the success of deep GNNs, we
propose to criticize the inherited knowledge from node-level and class-level
views with a trainable discriminator. The discriminator distinguishes between
teacher knowledge and what the student inherits, while the student GNN works as
a generator and aims to fool the discriminator. To our best knowledge, GraphAKD
is the first to introduce adversarial training to knowledge distillation in
graph domains. Experiments on node-level and graph-level classification
benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAKD improves the student performance by a
large margin. The results imply that GraphAKD can precisely transfer knowledge
from a complicated teacher GNN to a compact student GNN.

healthcare workforce. This paper presents the first end-to-end deep learning
framework for predicting physician burnout based on electronic health record
(EHR) activity logs, digital traces of physician work activities that are
available in any EHR system. In contrast to prior approaches that exclusively
relied on surveys for burnout measurement, our framework directly learns deep
representations of physician behaviors from large-scale clinician activity logs
to predict burnout. We propose the Hierarchical burnout Prediction based on
Activity Logs (HiPAL), featuring a pre-trained time-dependent activity
embedding mechanism tailored for activity logs and a hierarchical predictive
model, which mirrors the natural hierarchical structure of clinician activity
logs and captures physicians' evolving burnout risk at both short-term and
long-term levels. To utilize the large amount of unlabeled activity logs, we
propose a semi-supervised framework that learns to transfer knowledge extracted
from unlabeled clinician activities to the HiPAL-based prediction model. The
experiment on over 15 million clinician activity logs collected from the EHR at
a large academic medical center demonstrates the advantages of our proposed
framework in predictive performance of physician burnout and training
efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches.

flux ropes (MFRs), which usually appear as hot channels in active regions and
coronal cavities in quiet-Sun regions. CMEs often exhibit the classical
three-part structure in the lower corona when imaged with white-light
coronagraphs, including the bright front, dark cavity, and bright core. The
bright core and dark cavity have been regarded as the erupted prominence and
MFR, respectively, for several decades. However, recent studies clearly
demonstrated that both the prominence and hot-channel MFR can be observed as
the CME core. The current research presents a three-part CME resulted from the
eruption of a coronal prominence cavity on 2010 October 7 with observations
from two vantage perspectives, i.e., edge-on from the Earth and face-on from
the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Our observations
illustrates two important results: (1) For the first time, the erupting coronal
cavity is recorded as a channel-like structure in the extreme-ultraviolet
passband, analogous to the hot-channel morphology, and is dubbed as warm
channel; (2) Both the prominence and warm-channel MFR (coronal cavity) in the
extreme-ultraviolet passbands evolve into the CME core in the white-light
coronagraphs of STEREO-A. The results support that we are walking toward a
unified explanation for the three-part structure of CMEs, in which both
prominences and MFRs (hot or warm channels) are responsible for the bright
core.

with a cryogenic 600 g Ge detector operated in a high-voltage mode to optimize

article, we present an effective field theory (EFT) analysis of the CDMSlite
Run 2 data using an extended energy range and a comprehensive treatment of the
expected background. A binned likelihood Bayesian analysis was performed on the
recoil energy data, taking into account the parameters of the EFT interactions
and optimizing the data selection with respect to the dominant background
components. Energy regions within 5$\sigma$ of known activation peaks were
removed from the analysis. The Bayesian evidences resulting from the different
operator hypotheses show that the CDMSlite Run 2 data are consistent with the
background-only models and do not allow for a signal interpretation assuming
any additional EFT interaction. Consequently, upper limits on the WIMP mass and
coupling-coefficient amplitudes and phases are presented for each EFT operator.
These limits improve previous CDMSlite Run 2 bounds for WIMP masses above 5
GeV/$c^2$.

that lead triiodide (PbI$_3$) columns de-rived from trimethylsulfonium (TMS)
lead triiodide (CH$_3$)$_3$SPbI$_3$ (TMSPbI$_3$) by stripping off TMS ligands
should be semimetallic, and additionally ultrahigh negative differential
resistance (NDR) can arise from the heterojunction composed of a TMSPbI$_3$
channel sandwiched by PbI$_3$ electrodes. Herein, we computationally explore
whether similar material and device characteristics can be obtained from other
one-dimensional halide perovskites based on non-Pb metal elements, and in doing
so deepen the understanding of their mechanistic origins. First, scanning
through several candidate metal halide inorganic frameworks as well as their
parental form halide perovskites, we find that the germanium triiodide
(GeI$_3$) column also assumes a semimetallic character by avoiding the Peierls
distortion. Next, adopting the bundled nanowire GeI$_3$-TMSGeI$_3$-GeI$_3$
junction configuration, we obtain a drastically high peak current density and
ultrahigh NDR at room temperature. Furthermore, the robustness and
controllability of NDR signals under strain are revealed, establishing its
potential for flexible electronics applications. It will be emphasized that,
despite the performance metrics notably enhanced over those from the
PbI$_3$-TMSPbI$_3$-PbI$_3$ case, these device characteristics still arise from
the identical quantum hybridization NDR mechanism.

the generator network. The core architecture of this network is a three-layered
deep residual neural network with skip connections. For improving the stability
of such complex architecture, we present a regularization scheme towards
limiting unprecedented variations on its weight vectors during training. This
regularization approach is quite compatible with the nature of adversarial
training and it is not computationally prohibitive in runtime. Furthermore, we
constantly monitor the variation of the weight vectors for identifying any
potential instabilities or irregularities to measure the strength of our

of the current task dynamically. The algorithm alternates between updating the
model weights and a latent task embedding, allowing the agent to parse the
stream of temporal experience into discrete events and organize learning about
them. On a continual learning benchmark, it achieves competitive end average
accuracy by mitigating forgetting, but importantly, by requiring the model to
adapt through latent updates, it organizes knowledge into flexible structures
with a cognitive interface to control them. Tasks later in the sequence can be
solved through knowledge transfer as they become reachable within the
well-factorized latent space. The algorithm meets many of the desiderata of an

characterizations of spacetimes admitting the new symmetry and show the
existence and uniqueness of formal expansions around the past null cone of the
singularity which may be considered analogues of the well-known
Fefferman--Graham expansions. In combination with previous results, our
analysis will show that the twisted self-similar solutions are sufficiently
general to describe all possible asymptotic behaviors for spacetimes in the
small data regime which are self-similar and whose homothetic vector field is
everywhere spacelike on an initial spacelike hypersurface. We present an
application of this later fact to the understanding of the global structure of
Fefferman--Graham spacetimes and the naked singularity exteriors of [I.

Vacuum Equations: The Exterior Solution, arXiv:1912.08478]. Lastly, we observe
that by an amalgamation of techniques from previous works, one may associate
true solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations to each of our formal
expansions in a suitable region of spacetime.

particular, Li partially plated on copper current collectors, relevant to the
anodeless, lithium metal cell which is a holy grail of high density energy

exhibit short shelf lives. We apply large scale Density Functional Theory (DFT)
calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the reaction
between the electrolyte and Li|Cu junctions coated with thin, uniform
electrolyte interphase (SEI) passivating films at two applied voltages. These
novel DFT galvanic corrosion simulations show that electrolyte degradation
preferentially occurs on Li-plated regions and should lead to thicker SEI
films. Our simulations reveal similarities but also fundamental differences
between traditional metal localized pitting and Li-corrosion mechanisms.
Furthermore, using the recently proposed, highly reactive lithium hydride (LiH)

degradation pathways which are partially responsible for self-discharge, with
the chemical pathway found to exhibit slow kinetics. We also predict that
electric fields should in general exist across natural SEI components like LiH,

application-dependent (e.g., bidirectional attention is beneficial for
fine-tuning and infilling, but harmful for next token prediction and zero-shot
priming). We train models with up to 6.7B parameters, and find differences to
remain consistent at scale. While prior work on scaling has focused on

In this work, we theoretically investigate the universal low-energy behavior of

when two fermions get as close as the interaction range, and consider
perturbatively the correction of the spin-orbit coupling up to the second
order, in which new scattering parameters are introduced. Then for elastic
collisions, the scattering phase shifts are defined according to the unitary

phase shifts is modified by these new scattering parameters introduced by
spin-orbit coupling. The universality of the scattering phase shifts is
manifested as the independence of the specific form of the interatomic

widely used loss functions in machine learning. While there are many
similarities between them, they also have their own strengths when dealing with
different types of data. In this work, we introduce a new exponential family
based on a convex relaxation of the hinge loss function using softness and
class-separation parameters. This new family, denoted Soft-SVM, allows us to
prescribe a generalized linear model that effectively bridges between logistic
regression and SVM classification. This new model is interpretable and avoids
data separability issues, attaining good fitting and predictive performance by
automatically adjusting for data label separability via the softness parameter.
These results are confirmed empirically through simulations and case studies as
we compare regularized logistic, SVM, and Soft-SVM regressions and conclude
that the proposed model performs well in terms of both classification and
prediction errors.

(FL), where training data is sourced from untrusted clients over long periods
of time. These difficulties arise because: (a) defenders in FL do not have
access to raw training data, and (b) a new phenomenon we identify called
backdoor leakage causes models trained continuously to eventually suffer from
backdoors due to cumulative errors in defense mechanisms. We propose shadow
learning, a framework for defending against backdoor attacks in the FL setting
under long-range training. Shadow learning trains two models in parallel: a
backbone model and a shadow model. The backbone is trained without any defense
mechanism to obtain good performance on the main task. The shadow model
combines filtering of malicious clients with early-stopping to control the
attack success rate even as the data distribution changes. We theoretically
motivate our design and show experimentally that our framework significantly
improves upon existing defenses against backdoor attacks.

loads in smart grid is getting much higher than before. It is highly important
to model flexible loads based on demand response. Therefore, a new demand
response method considering multiple flexible loads is proposed in this paper
to character the integrated demand response (IDR) resources. Firstly, a
physical process analytical deduction (PPAD) model is proposed to improve the
classification of flexible loads in industrial parks. Scenario generation, data
point augmentation, and smooth curves under various operating conditions are
considered to enhance the applicability of the model. Secondly, in view of the
strong volatility and poor modeling effect of Wasserstein-generative
adversarial networks (WGAN), an improved WGAN-gradient penalty (IWGAN-GP) model
is developed to get a faster convergence speed than traditional WGAN and
generate a higher quality samples. Finally, the PPAD and IWGAN-GP models are
jointly implemented to reveal the degree of correlation between flexible loads.
Meanwhile, an intelligent offline database is built to deal with the impact of
nonlinear factors in different response scenarios. Numerical examples have been
performed with the results proving that the proposed method is significantly
better than the existing technologies in reducing load modeling deviation and
improving the responsiveness of park loads.

defend Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. However, the
phenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness will drop sharply at a
certain stage, always exists during AT. It is of great importance to decrease
this robust generalization gap in order to obtain a robust model. In this
paper, we present an in-depth study towards the robust overfitting from a new
angle. We observe that consistency regularization, a popular technique in
semi-supervised learning, has a similar goal as AT and can be used to alleviate
robust overfitting. We empirically validate this observation, and find a
majority of prior solutions have implicit connections to consistency
regularization. Motivated by this, we introduce a new AT solution, which
integrates the consistency regularization and Mean Teacher (MT) strategy into
AT. Specifically, we introduce a teacher model, coming from the average weights
of the student models over the training steps. Then we design a consistency
loss function to make the prediction distribution of the student models over
adversarial examples consistent with that of the teacher model over clean
samples. Experiments show that our proposed method can effectively alleviate
robust overfitting and improve the robustness of DNN models against common
adversarial attacks.

manual tuning does not scale, and automated tuning requires ground truth, which
is rarely available.
  In this paper, we explore MOSPAT, an end-to-end automated machine learning
based approach for model and parameter selection, combined with a generative
model to produce labeled data. Our scalable end-to-end system allows individual
users in large organizations to tailor time-series monitoring to their specific
use case and data characteristics, without expert knowledge of anomaly
detection algorithms or laborious manual labeling. Our extensive experiments on
real and synthetic data demonstrate that this method consistently outperforms
using any single algorithm.

reducing the number of activation function and normalization layers, and adding
inverted bottleneck structure and grouping convolution. Then, the Transformer
is used to extract the relationship of series features to realize the
classification and recognition of human activities. Our framework has a clear

extract eggs from the recovered nematode cysts. We incorporated mechanisms to
actuate the stage system, manipulate positions of individual sieves using the

grind the cysts to release their eggs. All system functions are controlled and
operated by a touchscreen interface software. The performance of the robotic

system, medical image segmentation has received extensive research and
concentration from the neural network community. A series of UNet-like networks
with encoder-decoder architecture has achieved extraordinary success, in which
UNet2+ and UNet3+ redesign skip connections, respectively proposing dense skip
connection and full-scale skip connection and dramatically improving compared
with UNet in medical image segmentation. However, UNet2+ lacks sufficient
information explored from the full scale, which will affect the learning of
organs' location and boundary. Although UNet3+ can obtain the full-scale
aggregation feature map, owing to the small number of neurons in the structure,
it does not satisfy the segmentation of tiny objects when the number of samples
is small. This paper proposes a novel network structure combining dense skip
connections and full-scale skip connections, named UNet-sharp (UNet\#) for its
shape similar to symbol \#. The proposed UNet\# can aggregate feature maps of
different scales in the decoder sub-network and capture fine-grained details
and coarse-grained semantics from the full scale, which benefits learning the
exact location and accurately segmenting the boundary of organs or lesions. We
perform deep supervision for model pruning to speed up testing and make it
possible for the model to run on mobile devices; furthermore, designing two
classification-guided modules to reduce false positives achieves more accurate
segmentation results. Various experiments of semantic segmentation and instance
segmentation on different modalities (EM, CT, MRI) and dimensions (2D, 3D)

the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

charged-rotating-NUT-Kiselev (CRNK) black hole in the Rastall theory of

spacetime in the Rastall gravity we show that the deflection angle of photons
due to the gravitational lensing is mostly influenced by the NUT charge,
parameter of the equation of state for the quintessence and the quintessential
intensity. We observe that the effects of the rest of the spacetime parameters
are negligible on the deflection angle. We present the shape of the shadow cast
by the CRNK black hole in the Rastall gravity for various values of the
spacetime parameters. We demonstrate that spin parameter $a$ of the black hole
changes the position and size of the shadow of the black hole very little.
While changing the values of the rest of the spacetime parameters can alter the
shape and the size of the observed shadow of the black hole significantly. We
observe that the radius of the black hole shadow and the deflection angle of a
photon are bigger for the CRNK black hole in the Rastall gravity, as compared
with the case of the Kerr black hole. Lastly, we show how the spacetime
parameters can change the observables $R_s$ and $\delta_s$, being the average
radius of the shadow and the distortion parameter that measures the deviation
of the shape of the shadow from a perfect circle with radius $R_s$,

independent subtasks, including classification and localization. They learn the
classification subnetwork by processing each sample separately and neglect the
relationship among positive and negative samples. Moreover, such tracking
paradigm takes only the classification confidence of proposals for the final
prediction, which may yield the misalignment between classification and
localization. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a ranking-based
optimization algorithm to explore the relationship among different proposals.
To this end, we introduce two ranking losses, including the classification one
and the IoU-guided one, as optimization constraints. The classification ranking
loss can ensure that positive samples rank higher than hard negative ones,
i.e., distractors, so that the trackers can select the foreground samples
successfully without being fooled by the distractors. The IoU-guided ranking
loss aims to align classification confidence scores with the Intersection over
Union(IoU) of the corresponding localization prediction for positive samples,
enabling the well-localized prediction to be represented by high classification
confidence. Specifically, the proposed two ranking losses are compatible with
most Siamese trackers and incur no additional computation for inference.
Extensive experiments on seven tracking benchmarks, including OTB100, UAV123,
TC128, VOT2016, NFS30, GOT-10k and LaSOT, demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed ranking-based optimization algorithm. The code and raw results are

However, hurdled by the limited quantum resources nowadays, QAOAs are
infeasible to manipulate large-scale problems. To address this issue, here we
revisit the MaxCut problem via the divide-and-conquer heuristic: seek the
solutions of subgraphs in parallel and then merge these solutions to obtain the
global solution. Due to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in MaxCut, we prove that
the merging process can be further cast into a new MaxCut problem and thus be
addressed by QAOAs or other MaxCut solvers. With this regard, we propose
QAOA-in-QAOA ($\text{QAOA}^2$) to solve arbitrary large-scale MaxCut problems
using small quantum machines. We also prove that the approximation ratio of
$\text{QAOA}^2$ is lower bounded by 1/2. Experiment results illustrate that
under different graph settings, $\text{QAOA}^2$ attains a competitive or even
better performance over the best known classical algorithms when the node count

field from phase-space measurements of stellar streams. Our approach is based
on a flexible and differentiable fit to the stream in phase-space, enabling a
direct estimate of the acceleration vector along the stream. Reconstruction of
the local acceleration field can be applied independently to each of several
streams, allowing us to sample the acceleration field due to the underlying
galactic potential across a range of scales. Our approach is methodologically
different from previous works, since a model for the gravitational potential
does not need to be adopted beforehand. Instead, our flexible
neural-network-based model treats the stream as a collection of orbits with a
locally similar mixture of energies, rather than assuming that the stream
delineates a single stellar orbit. Accordingly, our approach allows for
distinct regions of the stream to have different mean energies, as is the case
for real stellar streams. Once the acceleration vector is sampled along the
stream, standard analytic models for the galactic potential can then be rapidly
constrained. We find our method recovers the correct parameters for a
ground-truth triaxial logarithmic halo potential when applied to simulated
stellar streams. Alternatively, we demonstrate that a flexible potential can be
constrained with a neural network, though standard multipole expansions can
also be constrained. Our approach is applicable to simple and complicated
gravitational potentials alike, and enables potential reconstruction from a
fully data-driven standpoint using measurements of slowly phase-mixing tidal

evaluation metric for binary classifiers. In this paper, we discuss techniques
to segment the AUC-ROC along human-interpretable dimensions. AUC-ROC is not an
additive/linear function over the data samples, therefore such segmenting the
overall AUC-ROC is different from tabulating the AUC-ROC of data segments. To
segment the overall AUC-ROC, we must first solve an \emph{attribution} problem
to identify credit for individual examples.
  We observe that AUC-ROC, though non-linear over examples, is linear over
\emph{pairs} of examples. This observation leads to a simple, efficient
attribution technique for examples (example attributions), and for pairs of
examples (pair attributions). We automatically slice these attributions using
decision trees by making the tree predict the attributions; we use the notion
of honest estimates along with a t-test to mitigate false discovery.
  Our experiments with the method show that an inferior model can outperform a
superior model (trained to optimize a different training objective) on the
inferior model's own training objective, a manifestation of Goodhart's Law. In
contrast, AUC attributions enable a reasonable comparison. Example attributions
can be used to slice this comparison. Pair attributions are used to categorize
pairs of items -- one positively labeled and one negatively -- that the model
has trouble separating. These categories identify the decision boundary of the
classifier and the headroom to improve AUC.

from inference by an untrusted data curator, recent studies show that an
attacker can launch a data poisoning attack from the user side to inject
carefully-crafted bogus data into the LDP protocols in order to maximally skew
the final estimate by the data curator.
  In this work, we further advance this knowledge by proposing a new
fine-grained attack, which allows the attacker to fine-tune and simultaneously
manipulate mean and variance estimations that are popular analytical tasks for
many real-world applications. To accomplish this goal, the attack leverages the
characteristics of LDP to inject fake data into the output domain of the local
LDP instance. We call our attack the output poisoning attack (OPA). We observe
a security-privacy consistency where a small privacy loss enhances the security
of LDP, which contradicts the known security-privacy trade-off from prior work.
We further study the consistency and reveal a more holistic view of the threat
landscape of data poisoning attacks on LDP. We comprehensively evaluate our
attack against a baseline attack that intuitively provides false input to LDP.
The experimental results show that OPA outperforms the baseline on three
real-world datasets. We also propose a novel defense method that can recover

to $O(1/k^{3p/2})$. We also observe that the method achieves this accelerated
rate from a very early stage, suggesting a promising mode of acceleration for
this family of methods.

  prosocial behavior",,,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Perspective taking, which allows people to imagine another's thinking and
goals, is known to be an effective method for promoting prosocial behaviors in
human-computer interactions. However, most of the previous studies have focused
on simulating human-human interactions in the real world by offering
participants experiences related to various moral tasks through the use of
human-like virtual agents. In this study, we investigated whether taking the
perspective of a different robot in a robot-altruistic task would influence the
social behaviors of participants in a dictator game. Our findings showed that
participants who watched the help-receiver view exhibited more altruistic
behaviors toward a robot than those who watched the help-provider view. We also
found that, after watching robots from two different viewpoints in the task,
participants did not change their behavior toward another participant.

oriented bounding box (OBB), quadrilateral bounding box (QBB), and point set
(PointSet). Each representation encounters problems that correspond to its
characteristics, such as the boundary discontinuity, square-like problem,
representation ambiguity, and isolated points, which lead to inaccurate
detection. Although many effective strategies have been proposed for various
representations, there is still no unified solution. Current detection methods
based on Gaussian modeling have demonstrated the possibility of breaking this
dilemma; however, they remain limited to OBB. To go further, in this paper, we
propose a unified Gaussian representation called G-Rep to construct Gaussian
distributions for OBB, QBB, and PointSet, which achieves a unified solution to
various representations and problems. Specifically, PointSet or QBB-based
object representations are converted into Gaussian distributions, and their
parameters are optimized using the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm.
Then, three optional Gaussian metrics are explored to optimize the regression
loss of the detector because of their excellent parameter optimization
mechanisms. Furthermore, we also use Gaussian metrics for sampling to align
label assignment and regression loss. Experimental results on several public
available datasets, such as DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD, and ICDAR2015, show the
excellent performance of the proposed method for arbitrary-oriented object
detection.

fine-tuning as (masked) token prediction or generation, depending on the choice
of pre-trained language models. In our experiments, we apply FFF-NER to
fine-tune both BERT and BART for few-shot NER on several benchmark datasets and
observe significant improvements over existing fine-tuning strategies,

The key insight of the learned index is to approximate the mapping between keys
and positions with piece-wise linear functions. Such methods require
partitioning key space for a better approximation. Although lots of heuristics
are proposed to improve the approximation quality, the bottleneck is that the
segmentation overheads could hinder the overall performance. This paper tackles
the approximation problem by applying a \textit{distribution transformation} to
the keys before constructing the learned index. A two-stage
Normalizing-Flow-based Learned index framework (NFL) is proposed, which first
transforms the original complex key distribution into a near-uniform
distribution, then builds a learned index leveraging the transformed keys. For
effective distribution transformation, we propose a Numerical Normalizing Flow
(Numerical NF). Based on the characteristics of the transformed keys, we
propose a robust After-Flow Learned Index (AFLI). To validate the performance,
comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic and real-world
workloads, which shows that the proposed NFL produces the highest throughput
and the lowest tail latency compared to the state-of-the-art learned indexes.

class of epidermal radiofrequency identification (RFID) sensor-tags attached to
the fingers, communicating with a body-worn reader. These devices are promising
candidates to enable Tactile Internet (TI) applications in the short term.
R-FAD based on auto-tuning RFID microchips can be used as dielectric probes for
the material of touched objects. However, due to the nearly unpredictable
intrinsic variability of finger-object interaction, a single sensorized finger
(single-channel device) is not enough to guarantee reliable data sampling.
These limitations can be overcome by exploiting a multi-channel R-FAD
sensorizing multiple fingers of the hand. In this paper, the dielectric-sensing
performance of a multi-channel R-FAD, composed of sensors encapsulated into
soft elastomers, is numerically and experimentally characterized, involving a
set of volunteers. The inter-sensor coupling is negligible, thus enabling
simultaneous independent dielectric measurements. The multi-sensor
configuration allows for 100% reliability of the on-hand communication link for
touched objects in a wide range of permittivity. Experiments moreover
demonstrate that multi-channel measurements can halve the measurement
uncertainty of the single-channel case. The achievable precision is suitable to
discriminate among low-, medium-, and high-permittivity materials.

many methods have been proposed for the single local community detection that
finds a community containing the given set of query nodes. However, nodes may
belong to several communities in the network, and detecting all the communities
for the query node set, termed as the multiple local community detection
(MLCD), is more important as it could uncover more potential information. MLCD
is also more challenging because when a query node belongs to multiple
communities, it always locates in the complicated overlapping region and the
marginal region of communities. Accordingly, detecting multiple communities for
such nodes by applying seed expansion methods is insufficient.
  In this work, we address the MLCD based on higher-order structural importance
(HoSI). First, to effectively estimate the influence of higher-order
structures, we propose a new variant of random walk called Active Random Walk
to measure the HoSI score between nodes. Then, we propose two new metrics to
evaluate the HoSI score of a subgraph to a node and the HoSI score of a node,
respectively. Based on the proposed metrics, we present a novel algorithm
called HoSIM to detect multiple local communities for a single query node.
HoSIM enforces a three-stage processing, namely subgraph sampling, core member
identification, and local community detection. The key idea is utilizing HoSI
to find and identify the core members of communities relevant to the query node
and optimize the generated communities. Extensive experiments illustrate the
effectiveness of HoSIM.

Middle-level feature, which represents the music's melodiousness, rhythmic

temperature range covered is log$_{10}(T)=5.5-6.3$. The circular polarization
signal due to longitudinal Zeeman effect is estimated for spectral lines in the
wavelength range of 500 to 1600 \r{A}. The Stokes $V/I$ signal for a FUV line
is found to be in the order of 10$^{-4}$ for a longitudinal field strength of
10 Gauss, which further reduces to 10$^{-5}$ for wavelengths below 1200 \r{A}.
Due to such low signals, the present study aims to find combination of spectral
lines having different Hanle sensitivity but with identical peak formation
temperature to probe coronal magnetic field vector. The combination of Hanle
sensitive lines is better suited because the Hanle signals are stronger by at
least an order of magnitude compared to Zeeman signals. The linear polarization
signals due to Hanle effect from at least two spectral lines are required to
derive information on the full vector. It is found from this study that there
is always a pair of Hanle sensitive lines for a given temperature range

close proximity with each other in terms of their wavelength.

that is, a pass move that may be used at most once in the game and not from a
terminal position. Once a pass has been used by either player, it is no longer
available. It is well-known that in classical Nim, the introduction of the pass
alters the underlying structure of the game, significantly increasing its
complexity. In the restricted Nim considered in this study, the pass move was
found to have a minimal impact. There is a simple relationship between the
Grundy numbers of restricted Nim and the Grundy numbers of restricted Nim with
a pass, where the number of piles can be any natural number. Therefore, the
authors address a longstanding open question in combinatorial game theory: the

two-point galaxy correlation function (2PCF) measured with the Landy-Szalay
estimator. The standard way of evaluating the covariance matrix consists in
running the estimator on a large number of mock catalogs, and evaluating their
sample covariance. With large random catalog sizes (data-to-random objects
ratio M>>1) the computational cost of the standard method is dominated by that
of counting the data-random and random-random pairs, while the uncertainty of
the estimate is dominated by that of data-data pairs. We present a method
called Linear Construction (LC), where the covariance is estimated for small
random catalogs of size M = 1 and M = 2, and the covariance for arbitrary M is
constructed as a linear combination of these. We validate the method with
PINOCCHIO simulations in range r = 20-200 Mpc/h, and show that the covariance
estimate is unbiased. With M = 50 and with 2 Mpc/h bins, the theoretical
speed-up of the method is a factor of 14. We discuss the impact on the
precision matrix and parameter estimation, and derive a formula for the

decoupled structure of the planning problem, a path planner based on Gaussian
process first generates a continuous arc-length parameterized path in the
Fren\'{e}t frame, considering static obstacle avoidance and curvature
constraints. We theoretically prove that it is a good generalization of the
well-known jerk optimal solution. An efficient s-t graph search method is
introduced to find a speed profile along the generated path to deal with
dynamic environments. Finally, the path and speed are optimized incrementally
and iteratively to ensure kinodynamic feasibility. Various simulated scenarios
with both static obstacles and dynamic agents verify the effectiveness and
robustness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that our method

  Feature Compression and Edge Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, deploying deep neural network (DNN) models via collaborative
inference, which splits a pre-trained model into two parts and executes them on
user equipment (UE) and edge server respectively, becomes attractive. However,
the large intermediate feature of DNN impedes flexible decoupling, and existing
approaches either focus on the single UE scenario or simply define tasks
considering the required CPU cycles, but ignore the indivisibility of a single
DNN layer. In this paper, we study the multi-agent collaborative inference
scenario, where a single edge server coordinates the inference of multiple UEs.
Our goal is to achieve fast and energy-efficient inference for all UEs. To
achieve this goal, we first design a lightweight autoencoder-based method to
compress the large intermediate feature. Then we define tasks according to the
inference overhead of DNNs and formulate the problem as a Markov decision
process (MDP). Finally, we propose a multi-agent hybrid proximal policy
optimization (MAHPPO) algorithm to solve the optimization problem with a hybrid
action space. We conduct extensive experiments with different types of
networks, and the results show that our method can reduce up to 56\% of
inference latency and save up to 72\% of energy consumption.

of personalized services that satisfy users' preferences. With personalized
recommendation services, users can enjoy a variety of recommendations such as
movies, books, ads, restaurants, and more. Despite the great benefits,
personalized recommendations typically require the collection of personal data
for user modelling and analysis, which can make users susceptible to attribute
inference attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability of existing centralized
recommenders under attribute inference attacks leaves malicious attackers a
backdoor to infer users' private attributes, as the systems remember
information of their training data (i.e., interaction data and side
information). An emerging practice is to implement recommender systems in the
federated setting, which enables all user devices to collaboratively learn a
shared global recommender while keeping all the training data on device.
However, the privacy issues in federated recommender systems have been rarely
explored. In this paper, we first design a novel attribute inference attacker
to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of the state-of-the-art federated
recommender models. The experimental results show that the vulnerability of
each model component against attribute inference attack is varied, highlighting
the need for new defense approaches. Therefore, we propose a novel adaptive
privacy-preserving approach to protect users' sensitive data in the presence of
attribute inference attacks and meanwhile maximize the recommendation accuracy.
Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the superior
performance of our model on both recommendation effectiveness and resistance to
inference attacks.

introduce a simple yet powerful approach to analyze robust stability of DD-MPC
by combining continuity of DD-MPC w.r.t. noise with inherent robustness of
model-based MPC, i.e., robustness of nominal MPC w.r.t. small disturbances.
Moreover, we discuss how the presented proof technique allows to show
closed-loop stability of a variety of DD-MPC schemes with noisy data, as long
as the corresponding model-based MPC is inherently robust.

increased internal complexity and challenging design parameters, we find
several molecules possessing quasi-closed photon cycling schemes with highly
diagonal, visible and near-infrared transitions. Furthermore, we identify new
heuristics for engineering optically controllable and laser-coolable polyatomic

Mathematical modelling of this biological process allows to formalize the

development is correlated with the type and densities of axons in the tissue.
In addition, we study the identifiability of the model parameters. This informs

It leads to significant insights such that the transdifferentiation phenomenon
accelerates during the development process of PDAC cells. Finally, we give an

the following common limitation: their polynomial asymptotic approximation
speed of any set is bounded from above by the encoding speed of this set. We
introduce a new abstract property of approximation families, called

Specifically, we propose a Cross-modality Perceptual Style Transfer Network

Benefiting from the favorable geometry preservation ability of the CPSTN, the

  To circumvent this impossibility, we introduce two relaxations of the perfect

Building atop the approximate agreement primitive, we obtain efficient

set of sparse diffusion curves (DC) which characterize salient geometric
features and low-frequency colors and provide means for semantic color transfer
and facial expression editing. The middle level encodes specular highlights and
shadows to large and editable Poisson regions (PR) and allows the user to
directly adjust illumination via tuning the strength and/or changing shape of
PR. The top level contains two types of pixel-sized PRs for high-frequency
residuals and fine details such as pimples and pigmentation. We also train a
deep generative model that can produce high-frequency residuals automatically.
Thanks to the meaningful organization of vector primitives, editing portraits
becomes easy and intuitive. In particular, our method supports color transfer,
facial expression editing, highlight and shadow editing and automatic
retouching. Thanks to the linearity of the Laplace operator, we introduce alpha
blending, linear dodge and linear burn to vector editing and show that they are
effective in editing highlights and shadows. To quantitatively evaluate the
results, we extend the commonly used FLIP metric (which measures differences
between two images) by considering illumination. The new metric, called
illumination-sensitive FLIP or IS-FLIP, can effectively capture the salient
changes in color transfer results, and is more consistent with human perception
than FLIP and other quality measures on portrait images. We evaluate our method
on the FFHQR dataset and show that our method is effective for common portrait
editing tasks, such as retouching, light editing, color transfer and expression
editing. We will make the code and trained models publicly available.

severe domain gap between different imaging modalities without using the target
domain label. A key in this campaign relies upon aligning the distributions of
source and target domain. One common attempt is to enforce the global alignment
between two domains, which, however, ignores the fatal local-imbalance domain
gap problem, i.e., some local features with larger domain gap are harder to
transfer. Recently, some methods conduct alignment focusing on local regions to
improve the efficiency of model learning. While this operation may cause a
deficiency of critical information from contexts. To tackle this limitation, we
propose a novel strategy to alleviate the domain gap imbalance considering the
characteristics of medical images, namely Global-Local Union Alignment.
Specifically, a feature-disentanglement style-transfer module first synthesizes
the target-like source-content images to reduce the global domain gap. Then, a
local feature mask is integrated to reduce the 'inter-gap' for local features
by prioritizing those discriminative features with larger domain gap. This
combination of global and local alignment can precisely localize the crucial
regions in segmentation target while preserving the overall semantic
consistency. We conduct a series of experiments with two cross-modality

first part of the thesis is dedicated to the analysis of a 3D multi-scale
problem called the full Navier-Stokes-Fourier system where variations in
density and temperature are considered and in addition we take into account the
Coriolis, centrifugal and gravitational forces. We study, in the framework of
weak solutions, the combined incompressible and fast rotation limits in the
regime of small Mach, Froude and Rossby numbers and for general ill-prepared
initial data. In the case when the Mach number is of higher order than the
Rossby number, we prove that the limit dynamics is described by an
incompressible Oberbeck-Boussinesq type system. Conversely, when the Mach and
Rossby numbers have the same order of magnitude, we show convergence towards a

study the QPO frequency dependence on other spectral parameters and model the
energy dependent r.m.s and time-lag of the QPO to identify the physical
spectral parameters whose variation are responsible for the QPO. The QPO
frequency is found to also correlate with the scattering fraction (i.e. the
fraction of the soft photons Comptonized) and its dependence on the accretion
rate and inner disc radii is consistent with it being the dynamical frequency.
The time-lag between the hard and soft photons is negative for QPO frequency >
2.2 Hz and is positive for lesser values, making this the second black hole
system to show this behaviour after GRS 1915+105. Modelling the energy

of noise. Thermomechanical noise, intrinsic to the resonator, sets the ultimate
sensor performance when all other noise sources have been eliminated. For
linear resonators, the sensing resolution can always be further improved by
increasing the driving power. However, this trend cannot continue indefinitely,
since at sufficiently high driving powers non-linear effects emerge and
influence the noise performance. As a consequence, the resonator's non-linear
characteristics play an inextricable role in determining its ultimate
resolution limits. Recently, several works have studied the characteristic
performance of non-linear resonators as sensors, with the counter intuitive
conclusion that increasing the quality factor of a resonator does not improve
its sensing resolution at the thermomechanical limit. In this work we further
analyze the ultimate resolution limits, and describe different regimes of
performance at integration times below and above the resonator's decay time. We
provide an analytical model to elucidate the effects of Duffing non-linearity
on the resolution of closed-loop sensors, and validate it using numerical
simulations. In contrast to previous works, our model and simulations show that
under certain conditions the ultimate sensing resolution of a Duffing resonator
can be improved by maximizing its quality factor. With measurements on a
nanomechanical membrane resonator, we experimentally verify the model and
demonstrate that frequency resolutions can be achieved that surpass the
previously known limits.

Then, as a first step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we
explore possible defensive design methods to enhance the reader's awareness of
information misalignment when data facts are scripted and visualized. More
specifically, we conduct a between-subjects crowdsourcing study to investigate
the impact of two design methods enhancing text-visualization integration,

communicate directly with the brain. For most medical-type brain-computer

With the development of large-scale silicon technology and the increasing

becoming increasingly impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling
framework: Adaptive Contrastive Learning Model that learns representations from

loss function as a theoretical basis. Based on the fact that data with similar
features share the same labels whether they are multi-classified or
binary-classified. With this theoretical support, we simplify the
multi-classification problem into multiple binary-classification, improving
both the accuracy and the runtime efficiency. Moreover, we also introduce a
series of enhancements for the spikes, while solving the problem that the
classification effect is affected because of the overlapping spikes.

enrollment at University level in either conventional or distance education
environment, traditional ways of assessing students' work are becoming
insufficient in terms of both time and effort. In distance education
environment, such assessments become additionally more challenging in terms of
hefty remuneration for hiring large number of tutors. The availability of
automated tools to assist the evaluation of students' work and providing
students with appropriate and timely feedback can really help in overcoming
these problems. We believe that building such tools for assessing students'
work for all kinds of courses in not yet possible. However, courses that
involve some formal language of expression can be automated, such as,
programming courses in Computer Science (CS) discipline. Instructors provide
various practical exercises to students as assignments to build these skills.
Usually, instructors manually grade and provide feedbacks on these assignments.
Although in literature, various tools have been reported to automate this
process, but most of these tools have been developed by the host institutions
themselves for their own use. We at COMSATS Institute of Information
Technology, Lahore are conducting a pioneer effort in Pakistan to automate the
marking of assignments of introductory programming courses that involve C or

highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous
zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or

many downstream applications including expert finding and knowledge base

cannot effectively leverage various informative auxiliary data involved in the
CQA platform to aid entity linking, such as parallel answers and two types of
meta-data (i.e., topic tags and users). To remedy this crucial issue, we
propose a novel transformer-based framework to effectively harness the
knowledge delivered by different kinds of auxiliary data to promote the linking

soft symmetry breaking term that breaks the $SU(2)_g$ global symmetry into the

models is that the models can explain the current null results in the direct
detection experiments. The small momentum transfer suppresses the scattering
amplitudes thanks to the low energy behavior of the Nambu-Goldstone boson. In
our model, the soft symmetry breaking term is uniquely determined. This is the
advantage of our model to some earlier works in which some soft symmetry
breaking terms cannot be forbidden but are simply assumed to be absent to avoid
the constraints from the direct detection experiments. We calculate the thermal
relic abundance of the pNG DM and find that model can explain the measured

compromising the reliability of the state of the art object detectors. We
propose to solve this problem by using data augmentation and a novel training
loss term. To effectively train deep neural networks, a large set of labeled
data is needed. In case of adverse weather conditions, this process can be
extremely laborious and expensive. We address this issue in two steps: First,
we present a gas exhaust data generation method based on 3D surface
reconstruction and sampling which allows us to generate large sets of gas
exhaust clouds from a small pool of labeled data. Second, we introduce a point
cloud augmentation process that can be used to add gas exhaust to datasets
recorded in good weather conditions. Finally, we formulate a new training loss
term that leverages the augmented point cloud to increase object detection
robustness by penalizing predictions that include noise. In contrast to other
works, our method can be used with both grid-based and point-based detectors.
Moreover, since our approach does not require any network architecture changes,
inference times remain unchanged. Experimental results on real data show that
our proposed method greatly increases robustness to gas exhaust and noisy data.

Analyzing this standard protocol through the lens of utility theory in

data scarcity has become a crucial question for many real-world deep learning
(DL) applications. A popular methodology to efficiently enable the training of
DL models to perform tasks in scenarios with low availability of data is
transfer learning (TL). TL allows to transfer knowledge from a general domain
to a specific target one. However, such a knowledge transfer may put privacy at
risk when it comes to sensitive or private data. With CryptoTL we introduce a
solution to this problem, and show for the first time a cryptographic
privacy-preserving TL approach based on homomorphic encryption that is
efficient and feasible for real-world use cases. We achieve this by carefully
designing the framework such that training is always done in plain while still
profiting from the privacy gained by homomorphic encryption. To demonstrate the
efficiency of our framework, we instantiate it with the popular CKKS HE scheme
and apply CryptoTL to classification tasks with small datasets and show the
applicability of our approach for sentiment analysis and spam detection.
Additionally, we highlight how our approach can be combined with differential
privacy to further increase the security guarantees. Our extensive benchmarks
show that using CryptoTL leads to high accuracy while still having practical
fine-tuning and classification runtimes despite using homomorphic encryption.
Concretely, one forward-pass through the encrypted layers of our setup takes
roughly 1s on a notebook CPU.

agent's utility only depends on the coalition she resides. The subclass of
hedonic games that models the formation of general partnerships, where output
is shared equally among affiliates, is referred to as hedonic games with common
ranking property (HGCRP). Aside from their economic motivation, HGCRP came into
prominence since they are guaranteed to have core stable solutions that can be
found efficiently. We improve upon existing results by proving that every
instance of HGCRP has a solution that is Pareto optimal, core stable and
individually stable. The economic significance of this result is that
efficiency is not to be totally sacrificed for the sake of stability in HGCRP.
We establish that finding such a solution is {\bf NP-hard} even if the sizes of
the coalitions are bounded above by $3$; however, it is polynomial time
solvable if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by $2$. We show that
the gap between the total utility of a core stable solution and that of the
socially-optimal solution (OPT) is bounded above by $n$, where $n$ is the
number of agents, and that this bound is tight. Our investigations reveal that
computing OPT is inapproximable within better than $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ for any
fixed $\epsilon > 0$, and that this inapproximability lower bound is
polynomially tight. However, OPT can be computed in polynomial time if the

several countries committed to phasing down coal electricity as soon as
possible, deactivating hundreds of power plants in the near future. CO$_2$-free
electricity can be generated in these plants by retrofitting them for iron
combustion. Iron oxides produced during the process can be collected and
reduced back to metallic iron using H$_2$, in a circular process where it
becomes an energy carrier. Using clean energy in the recycling process enables
storage and distribution of excess generated in periods of abundance. This
concept uses and scales up existing dry metal cycle technologies, which are the
focus of extensive research worldwide. Retrofitting is evaluated here to
determine feasibility of adding these material requirements to markets, in the
context of current plans for decarbonization of steel industry, and policies on
hydrogen and renewable electricity. Results indicate that not only for a single
power plant, but also on larger scales, the retrofitting plan is viable,
promoting and supporting advancements in sustainable electricity, steel
industry and hydrogen production, converging necessary technological and

iron combustion technology by 2030, together with developing necessary
reduction infrastructure over the next decades, would pave the way for
large-scale retrofitting and support the phasing out of coal in many regions.
The proposed plan represents a feasible solution that takes advantage of

circular energy economies that increase local energy security.

signals is prone to be influenced by the change in the ambient environment and
varies over different sub-carriers. To remedy this issue, we propose an

diverse scenarios. In particular, a new Gabor residual block is designed to
address the impact of the changing surrounding environment with a focus on
learning reliable and robust temporal-frequency representations of WiFi
signals. In each block, the Gabor layer is integrated with the anti-aliasing
layer in a residual manner to gain the shift-invariant features. Furthermore,
fractal temporal and frequency self-attention are proposed in a joint effort to
explicitly concentrate on the efficacy of WiFi signals and thus enhance the
quality of output features scattered in different subcarriers. Experimental
results throughout our wireless-vision action recognition dataset (WVAR) and
three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraSens scheme outperforms

needed for solving a given task. ESNs are accessible models of neuronal
circuits, since they are relatively inexpensive to train. Therefore, ESNs have
become attractive for neuroscientists studying the relationship between neural
structure, function, and behavior. For instance, it is not yet clear how
distinctive connectivity patterns of brain networks support effective
interactions among their nodes and how these patterns of interactions give rise
to computation. To address this question, we employed an ESN with a
biologically inspired structure and used a systematic multi-site lesioning
framework to quantify the causal contribution of each node to the network's
output, thus providing a causal link between network structure and behavior. We
then focused on the structure-function relationship and decomposed the causal
influence of each node on all other nodes, using the same lesioning framework.
We found that nodes in a properly engineered ESN interact largely irrespective
of the network's underlying structure. However, in a network with the same
topology and a non-optimal parameter set, the underlying connectivity patterns
determine the node interactions. Our results suggest that causal
structure-function relations in ESNs can be decomposed into two components,
direct and indirect interactions. The former are based on influences relying on
structural connections. The latter describe the effective communication between
any two nodes through other intermediate nodes. These widely distributed
indirect interactions may crucially contribute to the efficient performance of

a Diffuse map guiding material estimation method based on the Generative

ergodic autoregressions assumes a homoskedastic error term, this paper provides
an extension to the case of conditionally heteroskedastic ARCH-type errors,
considerably widening the scope of potential applications. Specifically, we
consider suitably defined higher-order nonlinear autoregressions with possibly
nonlinear ARCH errors and show that they are, under appropriate conditions,
subgeometrically ergodic at a polynomial rate. An empirical example using
energy sector volatility index data illustrates the use of subgeometrically
ergodic AR-ARCH models.

  icy grains: a new computational framework",,,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The binding energies (BE) of molecules on the interstellar grains are crucial
in the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). Both temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) laboratory experiments and quantum chemistry
computations have often provided, so far, only single values of the BE for each
molecule. This is a severe limitation, as the ices enveloping the grain mantles
are structurally amorphous, giving rise to a manifold of possible adsorption
sites, each with different BEs. However, the ice amorphous nature prevents the
knowledge of structural details, hindering the development of a common accepted
atomistic icy model. In this work, we propose a computational framework that
closely mimics the formation of the interstellar grain mantle through a water
by water accretion. On that grain, an unbiased random (but well reproducible)
positioning of the studied molecule is then carried out. Here we present the
test case of NH$_3$, an ubiquitous species in the molecular ISM. We provide the
BE distribution computed by a hierarchy approach, using the semiempirical
xTB-GFN2 as low-level method to describe the whole icy cluster combined with
the B97D3 DFT functional as high-level method on the local zone of the NH$_3$
interaction. The final ZPE corrected BE is computed at
ONIOM(DLPNO-CCSD(T)//B97D3:xTB-GFN2) level, ensuring the best cost/accuracy
ratio. The main peak of the predicted NH$_3$ BE distribution is in agreement
with experimental TPD and literature computed data. A second broad peak at very
low BE values is also present, never detected before. It may provide the
solution to a long-standing puzzle about the presence of gaseous NH$_3$
observed also in cold ISM objects.

important far-infrared (FIR) emission lines throughout cosmic time back to
$z=6$ with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We study how different
physical parameters, such as the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and
metallicity, impact the ISM phases traced by FIR line luminosities and connect
those with the star-formation rate (SFR). We implement a physically motivated
multi-phase model of the ISM by post-processing EAGLE cosmological simulation
with Cloudy look-up tables. In this model, we assume four phases of the ISM:
dense molecular gas, neutral atomic gas, diffuse ionised gas (DIG) and HII
regions. Our model shows good agreement with the observed luminosity-SFR
relation up to $z=6$ in the FIR emission lines analysed and we also provide
linear fits. Our predictions also agree with observations in terms of
diagnostic diagrams involving various line ratios. We find that [C II] is the
best SFR tracer of the FIR lines even though it traces multiple ISM phases,
while [O III] and [N II] can be used to understand the DIG-HII balance in the
ionised phase. In addition, line ratios like [C II]/[O III] and [N II/[O I] are
useful to trace parameters such as ISRF, metallicity and specific
star-formation rate. These results help to interpret observations of FIR line
emission from the local Universe to high-$z$ galaxies.

ridge regression with the Gaussian kernel, the hyper-parameter is the
bandwidth. The bandwidth specifies the length-scale of the kernel and has to be
carefully selected in order to obtain a model with good generalization. The
default methods for bandwidth selection is cross-validation and marginal
likelihood maximization, which often yields good results, albeit at high
computational costs. Furthermore, the estimates provided by these methods tend
to have very high variance, especially when training data are scarce. Inspired
by Jacobian regularization, we formulate an approximate expression for how the
derivatives of the functions inferred by kernel ridge regression with the
Gaussian kernel depend on the kernel bandwidth. We then use this expression to
propose a closed-form, computationally feather-light, bandwidth selection
heuristic based on controlling the Jacobian. In addition, the Jacobian
expression illuminates how the bandwidth selection is a trade-off between the
smoothness of the inferred function, and the conditioning of the training data
kernel matrix. We show on real and synthetic data that compared to
cross-validation and marginal likelihood maximization, our method is
considerably faster and considerably more stable in terms of bandwidth

controller order. First of all a detailed physical model is derived and
validated using measurement data. Based on the linearized model both
controllers are designed to be comparable, i.e. they show a similar crossover
frequency in the open loop and the final controller order is reduced to the
same range for both designs. The major differences between both are the
different methods how the feed-forward action is included. The loop-shaping
approach with fractional-order elements relies on the plant inverse using a
flat output, whereas the H-infinty design incorporates a two-degree of freedom
control, i.e. the reference signal is included into the known inputs of the
generalized plant. Each controller is tested in simulation and experiment. As
both open-loops are nearly identical in the frequency range of interest, the
results from an input disturbance experiment show no major difference. The
different design approaches of the feed-forward path are clearly visible in the

small number of parameters and trains an attention module to interpolate the
source prompts and a newly initialized target prompt for every instance in the
target task. During training, only the target task prompt and the attention
weights, which are shared between tasks in multi-task training, are updated,
while the original LM and source prompts are intact. ATTEMPT is highly
parameter-efficient (e.g., updates 2,300 times fewer parameters than full
fine-tuning) while achieving high task performance using knowledge from
high-resource tasks. Moreover, it is modular using pre-trained soft prompts,

Our experimental results across 21 diverse NLP datasets show that ATTEMPT
significantly outperforms prompt tuning and outperforms or matches fully

quantified in CT, is a strong and independent predictor of coronary heart
disease (CHD) events. However, CAC scoring suffers from limited interscan
reproducibility, which is mainly due to the clinical definition requiring
application of a fixed intensity level threshold for segmentation of
calcifications. This limitation is especially pronounced in
non-ECG-synchronized CT where lesions are more impacted by cardiac motion and
partial volume effects. Therefore, we propose a CAC quantification method that
does not require a threshold for segmentation of CAC. Approach: Our method
utilizes a generative adversarial network where a CT with CAC is decomposed
into an image without CAC and an image showing only CAC. The method, using a
CycleGAN, was trained using 626 low-dose chest CTs and 514 radiotherapy
treatment planning CTs. Interscan reproducibility was compared to clinical
calcium scoring in radiotherapy treatment planning CTs of 1,662 patients, each
having two scans. Results: A lower relative interscan difference in CAC mass
was achieved by the proposed method: 47% compared to 89% manual clinical
calcium scoring. The intraclass correlation coefficient of Agatston scores was
0.96 for the proposed method compared to 0.91 for automatic clinical calcium
scoring. Conclusions: The increased interscan reproducibility achieved by our
method may lead to increased reliability of CHD risk categorization and
improved accuracy of CHD event prediction.

of unstable RWI modes in terms of the linear perturbation analysis. The cooling
associated with the energy equation is treated in two different ways. The first
one we adopt is a simple cooling law. The perturbed thermal state relaxes to
the initial thermal state on a prescribed cooling timescale. In the second, we
treat the cooling as a thermal diffusion process. The difference in the growth
rate between the adiabatic and isothermal modes becomes more pronounced for
discs with smaller sound speed. For the simple cooling law, the growth rates of
unstable modes monotonically decrease with the shorter cooling timescale in
barotropic discs. But the dependence of growth rate with the cooling timescale
becomes non-monotonic in non-baratopic discs. The RWI might even be enhanced in
non-barotropic discs during the transition from the adiabatic state to the
isothermal state. When the cooling is treated as the thermal diffusion, even in
barotropic disc, the variation of growth rate with thermal diffusivity becomes
non-monotonic. Further more, a maximum growth rate may appear with an
appropriate value of thermal diffusivity. The angular momentum flux (AMF) is
investigated to understand the angular momentum transport by RWI with cooling.

  Multi-label Text Classification",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) refers to the problem of
tagging a given text with the most relevant subset of labels from a large label
set. A majority of labels only have a few training instances due to large label
dimensionality in XMTC. To solve this data sparsity issue, most existing XMTC
methods take advantage of fixed label clusters obtained in early stage to
balance performance on tail labels and head labels. However, such label
clusters provide static and coarse-grained semantic scope for every text, which
ignores distinct characteristics of different texts and has difficulties
modelling accurate semantics scope for texts with tail labels. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework TReaderXML for XMTC, which adopts dynamic and
fine-grained semantic scope from teacher knowledge for individual text to
optimize text conditional prior category semantic ranges. TReaderXML
dynamically obtains teacher knowledge for each text by similar texts and
hierarchical label information in training sets to release the ability of
distinctly fine-grained label-oriented semantic scope. Then, TReaderXML
benefits from a novel dual cooperative network that firstly learns features of
a text and its corresponding label-oriented semantic scope by parallel Encoding
Module and Reading Module, secondly embeds two parts by Interaction Module to
regularize the text's representation by dynamic and fine-grained label-oriented
semantic scope, and finally find target labels by Prediction Module.
Experimental results on three XMTC benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves new state-of-the-art results and especially performs well for severely
imbalanced and sparse datasets.

suggests that, within a finite energy window, the TPFs are robust up to a
critical strength of disorder. In the strong disorder regime, the inter-TPF
scattering is the main mechanism for destroying a single TPF. Moreover, we
study the effects of disorder on the distribution of Fermi arcs and surface
Berry curvature. We demonstrate that the Fermi arc retains its sharpness at
weak disorder, but gradually dissolves into the metallic bulk for stronger
disorder. In clean limit, the surface Berry curvature exhibits a bipolar
configuration in the surface Brillouin zone. With increasing disorder, the
positive and negative surface Berry curvature start to merge at the nearby

an effective and efficient vision-language architecture with novel cross-modal
skip-connections, which creates inter-layer shortcuts that skip a certain
number of layers for time-consuming full self-attention on the vision side.
mPLUG is pre-trained end-to-end on large-scale image-text pairs with both
discriminative and generative objectives. It achieves state-of-the-art results
on a wide range of vision-language downstream tasks, such as image captioning,

databases and rapidly developing loss functions. The existing algorithms devote
to realizing an ideal idea: minimizing the intra-class distance and maximizing
the inter-class distance. However, they may neglect that there are also low
quality training images which should not be optimized in this strict way.
Considering the imperfection of training databases, we propose that intra-class
and inter-class objectives can be optimized in a moderate way to mitigate
overfitting problem, and further propose a novel loss function, named
sigmoid-constrained hypersphere loss (SFace). Specifically, SFace imposes
intra-class and inter-class constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which are
controlled by two sigmoid gradient re-scale functions respectively. The sigmoid
curves precisely re-scale the intra-class and inter-class gradients so that
training samples can be optimized to some degree. Therefore, SFace can make a
better balance between decreasing the intra-class distances for clean examples
and preventing overfitting to the label noise, and contributes more robust deep
face recognition models. Extensive experiments of models trained on
CASIA-WebFace, VGGFace2, and MS-Celeb-1M databases, and evaluated on several
face recognition benchmarks, such as LFW, MegaFace and IJB-C databases, have
demonstrated the superiority of SFace.

to identify regularities in sequences. This motivated us to construct a
benchmark task, which we term \textit{sequence consistency evaluation} (SCE),
whose solution requires the ability to identify regularities in sequences.
Given the proven capabilities of deep networks, their ability to solve such

naive (randomly initialized) deep learning models that are trained on a
\textit{single} SCE with a \textit{single} optimization step can still solve
non-trivial versions of the task relatively well. We extend our findings to
solve, without any prior training, real-world anomaly detection tasks in the

the sequenceability of subsets of abelian groups, which have been combined and
summarized in $[4]$ into the conjecture that if a subset of an abelian group
does not contain 0 then it is sequenceable. If the elements of a sequenceable
set $A$ do not sum to $0$ then there exists a simple path $P$ in the Cayley
graph $Cay[G:\pm A]$ such that $\Delta(P) = \pm A$.
  In this paper, inspired by this graph-theoretical interpretation, we propose
a weakening of this conjecture. Here, under the above assumptions, we want to
find an ordering whose partial sums define a walk $W$ of girth bigger than $t$

that the partial sums $s_i$ and $s_j$ are different whenever $i$ and $j$ are

$A$ does not contain pairs of type $\{x,-x\}$ and $t<8$.

technology. Today, the pipe routing is usually designed relying on a

solve the optimal pipe routing problem as a non-linear topology optimization
problem, drawing inspiration from density-based topology optimization. The
optimization problem is formulated around a non-linear heat transport model and
minimizes a detailed net present value representation of the heating network
cost. By relaxing the combinatorial problem of pipe placement, this approach
remains scalable for large-scale applications. A discrete network topology and
near-discrete pipe design is achieved by using an intermediate pipe

achieves a discrete network topology and near-discrete pipe design that

space of discontinuous polynomial functions of degree k, $\textbf{RT}_k$ is the
Raviart-Thomas space, and $\textbf{BDM}_k$ is the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini space.
We show that the standard ghost penalty stabilization, often added in the weak
forms of cut finite element methods for stability and control of the condition
number of the resulting linear system matrix, destroys the divergence-free
property of the considered element pairs. Therefore, we propose two corrections
to the standard stabilization strategy; using macro-elements and new
stabilization terms for the pressure. By decomposing the computational mesh
into macro-elements and applying ghost penalty terms only on interior edges of
macro-elements, stabilization is active only where needed. By modifying the
standard stabilization terms for the pressure we recover the optimal
approximation of the divergence without losing control of the condition number
of the linear system matrix. We derive a priori error estimates for the
unfitted finite element discretization with the new stabilization terms.
Numerical experiments indicate that with the new method we have 1) optimal
rates of convergence of the approximate velocity and pressure; 2) well-posed
linear systems where the condition number of the system matrix scales as for
fitted finite element discretizations; 3) optimal rates of convergence of the
approximate divergence with pointwise divergence-free approximations of
solenoidal velocity fields. All three properties hold independently of how the

cluster is treated as a self-interested player in a non-cooperative game where
agents in the same cluster cooperate together to optimize the payoff function
of the cluster. In a large-scale network, the information of agents in a
cluster can not be available immediately for agents beyond this cluster, which
raise challenges to the existing Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms. Hence, we
consider a partial-decision information scenario in generalized Nash
equilibrium seeking for multi-cluster games in a distributed manner. We
reformulate the problem as finding zeros of the sum of preconditioned monotone
operators by the primal-dual analysis and graph Laplacian matrix. Then a
distributed generalized Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is proposed without
requiring fully awareness of its opponent clusters' decisions based on a
forward-backward-forward method. With the algorithm, each agent estimates the
strategies of all the other clusters by communicating with neighbors via an
undirected network. We show that the derived operators can be monotone when the
communication strength parameter is sufficiently large. We prove the algorithm
convergence resorting to the fixed point theory by providing a sufficient

recently published neural anthropometer dataset by rendering images with
different camera distance. We evaluate the network inference absolute and
relative mean error between the estimated and actual HBDs. We train and
evaluate the CNN in four scenarios: (1) training with subjects of a specific

distance. Not only our experiments demonstrate that the network can perform the

certain asymptotically safe renormalization group (RG) trajectory, is explored
by solving its scale dependent effective field equations and embedding the
family of emerging 4-dimensional spacetimes into a single 5-dimensional
manifold, which thus encodes the complete information about all scales. By
construction the latter manifold is furnished with a natural foliation.
Heuristically, its leaves are interpreted as physical spacetime observed on
different scales of the experimental resolution. Generalizing earlier work on
the embedding of $d$-dimensional Euclidean QEG spacetimes in $(d +
1)$-dimensional flat or Ricci flat manifolds, we admit Lorentzian signature in
this paper and we consider embeddings in arbitrary $(d + 1)$-dimensional
Einstein spaces. Special attention is paid to the sector of maximally symmetric
metrics, and the fundamental definition of QEG in $d = 4$ that employs the
cross-over trajectory connecting the non-Gaussian to the Gaussian RG fixed
point. Concerning the embedding of the resulting family of 4D de Sitter
solutions with a running Hubble parameter, we find that there are only two
possible 5D spacetimes, namely the anti-de Sitter manifold AdS$_5$ and the de
Sitter manifold dS$_5$. To arrive at this result essential use is made of the
monotone scale dependence of the running cosmological constant featured by the
gravitational effective average action. We show that if the scale invariance of
the QEG fixed points extends to full conformal invariance, the 5D picture of
the resulting geometric and field theoretic structure displays a novel kind of
""AdS/CFT correspondence"". While strongly reminiscent of the usual string
theory-based AdS/CFT correspondence, also clear differences are found.

1) A novel MAE workflow, where the input sentence is polluted for encoder and
decoder with different masks. The sentence embedding is generated from the
encoder's masked input; then, the original sentence is recovered based on the
sentence embedding and the decoder's masked input via masked language modeling.
2) Asymmetric model structure, with a full-scale BERT like transformer as
encoder, and a one-layer transformer as decoder. 3) Asymmetric masking ratios,
with a moderate ratio for encoder: 15~30%, and an aggressive ratio for decoder:
50~70%. Our framework is simple to realize and empirically competitive: the

Internet-of-Things (IoT), Federated Learning (FL) has attracted steadily
increasing attentions as a promising distributed machine learning paradigm,
which enables the training of a central model on for numerous decentralized
devices without exposing their privacy. However, due to the biased data
distributions on involved devices, FL inherently suffers from low
classification accuracy in non-IID scenarios. Although various device grouping
method have been proposed to address this problem, most of them neglect both i)
distinct data distribution characteristics of heterogeneous devices, and ii)
contributions and hazards of local models, which are extremely important in
determining the quality of global model aggregation. In this paper, we present
an effective FL method named FedEntropy with a novel dynamic device grouping
scheme, which makes full use of the above two factors based on our proposed
maximum entropy judgement heuristic.Unlike existing FL methods that directly
aggregate local models returned from all the selected devices, in one FL round
FedEntropy firstly makes a judgement based on the pre-collected soft labels of
selected devices and then only aggregates the local models that can maximize
the overall entropy of these soft labels. Without collecting local models that
are harmful for aggregation, FedEntropy can effectively improve global model
accuracy while reducing the overall communication overhead. Comprehensive
experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that, FedEntropy not only
outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of model accuracy and
communication overhead, but also can be integrated into them to enhance their

providing witnesses of optical nonclassicality that overcome the need for state
tomography. These multicopy observables are used to construct a family of

surface elastic moduli by computing the tensions and elastic stretches between
material marker points. We perform stability analysis for the primary scheme
against perturbations on the marker-point locations, which may occur due to
image acquisition and processing from experiments. The perturbation analysis
shows that the primary scheme is more stable to noise when the spacing between
the marker points is coarser, and has been confirmed by the numerical
experiments where we apply the primary scheme to synthetic cell outlines from
simulations of hyper-elastic membrane deformation with random noise on the
marker-point locations. To improve the spatial resolution of elastic modulus
distribution of the primary scheme with noise, we propose two optimization
schemes that convert the step-function inferences of elastic moduli into
smooth-curve inferences. The first scheme infers a canonical elastic modulus
distribution based on marker-point locations from multiple cell samples of the
same cell type. The second scheme is a simplified cost-effective version that
infers the elastic moduli based on marker-point locations from a single cell.
The numerical experiments show that the first scheme significantly improves the
inference precision for the underlying canonical elastic modulus distributions
and can even capture some degree of nonlinearity when the underlying elastic
modulus gradients are nonlinear. The second cost-effective scheme can predict
the trend of the elastic modulus gradients consistently.

limited by the availability of labelled data. Transfer learning - specifically
in the form of domain adaptation (DA) - gives rise to the possibility of
leveraging information from a population of physical or numerical structures,
by inferring a mapping that aligns the feature spaces. Typical DA methods rely
on nonparametric distance metrics, which require sufficient data to perform
density estimation. In addition, these methods can be prone to performance
degradation under class imbalance. To address these issues, statistic alignment
(SA) is discussed, with a demonstration of how these methods can be made robust
to class imbalance, including a special case of class imbalance called a
partial DA scenario. SA is demonstrated to facilitate damage localisation with
no target labels in a numerical case study, outperforming other
state-of-the-art DA methods. It is then shown to be capable of aligning the
feature spaces of a real heterogeneous population, the Z24 and KW51 bridges,
with only 220 samples used from the KW51 bridge. Finally, in scenarios where
more complex mappings are required for knowledge transfer, SA is shown to be a
vital pre-processing tool, increasing the performance of established DA
methods.

the design of an efficient event-driven mechanism that mimics the brain.
Although event cameras can provide high dynamic range and low-energy event

Data augmentation can improve the quantity and quality of the original data by
processing more representations from the original data. This paper proposes an

carefully design the mixing of different event streams by Gaussian Mixture
Model to generate random 3D masks and achieve arbitrary shape mixing of event
streams in the spatio-temporal dimension. By computing the relative distances
of event streams, we propose a more reasonable way to assign labels to the

to our previous three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a neutron star
(NS) on a highly eccentric orbit that enters the envelope of an RSG star for
half a year and launches jets as it accretes mass via an accretion disk. We
find that for injected energies of ~1e47-1e48 erg and removed mass of
~0.03-0.6Mo the RSG envelope expands to a large radius. Therefore, we expect
the NS to continue to orbit inside this massive inflated envelope for several
more months, up to about twice the initial RSG radius, to continue to accrete
mass and launch jets for a prolonged period. Although these late jets are
weaker than the jets that the NS launches while inside the original RSG
envelope, the late jets might actually be more influential on the light curve,
leading to a long, several months to few years, and bright, about >10^8Lo,
transient event. The RSG returns to more or less a relaxed structure after
about ten years, and so another transient event might occur in the next
periastron passage of the NS. Our results add to the already rich variety of
jet-driven explosions/outbursts that might account for many puzzling transient
events.

hole X-ray binary candidate MAXI J1535-571. The observations were obtained in
2017 when the source evolved through the hard, hard-intermediate and
soft-intermediate states over the rising phase of the outburst. After
subtracting continuum components, X-ray reflection signatures are clearly
showed in those observations. By modeling the relativistic reflection in
detail, we find that the inner radius $R_{\rm{in}}$ is relatively stable with
$R_{\rm{in}}\lesssim 1.55 R_{\rm{g}}$ during the three states, which implies
that the inner radius likely extends to the innermost stable circular orbit
even in the bright hard state. When adopting $R_{\rm{in}} = R_{\rm{ISCO}}$, the
spin parameter is constrained to be $0.985_{-0.004}^{+0.002}$ at 90% confidence
(statistical only). The best-fitting results reveal that the inclination of the
inner accretion disc is $\sim70-74$ degrees, which notably conflicts with the
apparent orientation of the ballistic jet ($\leqslant$45 degrees). In addition,
both the photon index and the electron temperature increase during the
transition from hard to soft state. It seems that the corona evolves from dense
low-temperature in the LHS to tenuous high-temperature after the state
transition, which indicates that the state transition is accompanied by the

exact regional weight cancellation, to solve eigenvalue problems in nuclear
reactor physics in three spatial dimensions. The method previously exhibited
had several limitations (including multi-group transport and isotropic

we lift the previous limitations, in view of applying exact regional

This extended regional cancellation framework is used to optimize the
efficiency of the weight cancellation. Our findings are illustrated on a

statements about a mind's limitation during a decision process are derived from
recent results on the reconstruction of quantum theory from conceptual
variables. These results apply to any decision situation. Let all the data from
the Bell experiment be handed over to a new actor Charlie, who performs a data
analysis. But his mind is also limited: He has a four-dimensional Hilbert space
in the context determined by the experiment. I show that this implies that
neither Alice nor Charlie can have the argument leading to the CHSH inequality
as a background for making decisions related to the experiment. Charlie may be
any data analyst, and he may communicate with any person. It is argued that no
rational person can be convinced by the CHSH argument when making empirical
decisions on the Bell situation.

However, there has also been considerable concern both by industry and

concern are digital common cause failures specifically due to software defects.
These failures by the software can occur in both the control and monitoring of
a system. While many methods have been proposed to identify software failure
modes, such as Systems Theoretic Process Analysis, Hazard and Consequence
Analysis for Digital Systems, etc., these methods are focused primarily on the
control action pathway of a system. In contrast, the information feedback
pathway lacks Unsafe Control Actions, which are typically related to software
basic events; thus, assessment of software basic events in such systems is
unclear. In this work, we present the idea of intermediate processors and
Unsafe Information Flow (UIF) to help safety analysts trace failure mechanisms
in the feedback pathway and how they can be integrated into a fault tree for
improved assessment capability. The concepts presented are demonstrated in two
comprehensive case studies, a smart sensor integrated platform for unmanned
autonomous vehicles and another on a representative advanced human system
interface for safety critical plant monitoring. The qualitative software basic
events are identified, and a fault tree analysis is conducted based on a
modified Redundancy guided Systems theoretic Hazard Analysis methodology. The
case studies demonstrate the use of UIFs and intermediate processors in the
fault tree to improve traceability of software failures in highly complex
digital instrumentation feedback. The improved method clarifies fault tree
construction when multiple component dependencies are present in the system.

Orthogonal-defect Classification for Assessing Software Reliability (ORCAS) to
quantify probabilities of various software failure modes in a DI&C system. The
method utilizes accepted industry methodologies for quality assurance that are
verified by experimental evidence. In essence, the approach combines a semantic
failure classification model with a reliability growth model to predict the
probability of failure modes of a software system. A case study was conducted
on a representative I&C platform (ChibiOS) running a smart sensor acquisition
software developed by Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The testing and
evidence collection guidance in ORCAS was applied, and defects were uncovered
in the software. Qualitative evidence, such as modified condition decision
coverage, was used to gauge the completeness and trustworthiness of the
assessment while quantitative evidence was used to determine the software
failure probabilities. The reliability of the software was then estimated and
compared to existing operational data of the sensor device. It is demonstrated
that by using ORCAS, a semantic reasoning framework can be developed to justify
if the software is reliable (or unreliable) while still leveraging the strength
of the existing methods.

called AILS-PR, outperformed existing meta-heuristics for the CVRP on benchmark
instances. However, tests on large-scale instances of the CVRP suggested that
PR was too slow, making AILS-PR less advantageous in this case. To overcome
this challenge, this paper presents an Adaptive Iterated Local Search (AILS)

local search steps of ILS. The main difference between them is that the
reference solution in the first phase is found by the acceptance criterion,
while in the second phase it is selected from a pool of the best solutions
found in the search process, the so-called elite set. This algorithm, called
AILS-II, is very competitive on smaller instances, outperforming the other
methods from the literature with respect to the average gap to the best known

the region correlates with the B-field morphology and shows evidence of
multiple expanding shells. Our B-field strength maps, estimated using the

restrictions on the behavior of the remainder of the system that allow a

solutions, these assumptions should be necessary conditions for realizability.
However, because there are typically many different behaviors that realize the
same specification, necessary behavioral restrictions often do not exist. In
this paper, we introduce a new class of assumptions for compositional
synthesis, which we call information flow assumptions. Such assumptions capture
an essential aspect of distributed computing, because components often need to
act upon information that is available only in other components. The presence
of a certain flow of information is therefore often a necessary requirement,
while the actual behavior that establishes the information flow is
unconstrained. In contrast to behavioral assumptions, which are properties of

consider the task of visual grounding, where the agent segments an object from
a crowded scene given a natural language description. Modern holistic
approaches to visual grounding usually ignore language structure and struggle
to cover generic domains, therefore relying heavily on large datasets.
Additionally, their transfer performance in RGB-D datasets suffers due to high
visual discrepancy between the benchmark and the target domains. Modular
approaches marry learning with domain modeling and exploit the compositional
nature of language to decouple visual representation from language parsing, but
either rely on external parsers or are trained in an end-to-end fashion due to
the lack of strong supervision. In this work, we seek to tackle these

compositional visual grounding of entities, attributes, and spatial relations.
We exploit rich scene graph annotations generated in a synthetic domain and
train each module independently. Our approach is evaluated both in simulation

experiences an effective double-well potential in which the proton wavefunction
is delocalized between the two wells. Herein we employed the state-of-the-art
multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules partitioning scheme to
obtain the molecular structure, i.e. atoms in molecules and bonding network,
from the superposed ab initio wavefunctions of malonaldehyde. In contrast to
the familiar clamped-proton portrayal of malonaldehyde, in which the proton
forms a hydrogen basin, for the superposed states the hydrogen basin disappears
and two novel hybrid oxygen-hydrogen basins appear instead, with an even
distribution of the proton population between the two basins. The interaction
between the hybrid basins is stabilizing thanks to an unprecedented mechanism.
This involves the stabilizing classical Coulomb interaction of the one-proton
density in one of the basins with the one-electron density in the other basin.
This stabilizing mechanism yields a bond foreign to the known bonding modes in
chemistry.

analytical models and result in high relative errors. %Optimizing task
scheduling and reducing job failures in data centers are essential to improve
resource utilization and reduce carbon emissions. This paper investigates the
computational resource demands of 29 classical deep neural networks and builds
accurate models for predicting computational costs. We first analyze the

DNNAbacus can accurately predict both memory and time cost for PyTorch and

closely related to their initialization of parameters. Inspired by the phase
diagram for two-layer ReLU NNs with infinite width (Luo et al., 2021), we make
a step towards drawing a phase diagram for three-layer ReLU NNs with infinite
width. First, we derive a normalized gradient flow for three-layer ReLU NNs and
obtain two key independent quantities to distinguish different dynamical
regimes for common initialization methods. With carefully designed experiments
and a large computation cost, for both synthetic datasets and real datasets, we
find that the dynamics of each layer also could be divided into a linear regime
and a condensed regime, separated by a critical regime. The criteria is the
relative change of input weights (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists
of the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) as
the width approaches infinity during the training, which tends to $0$,
$+\infty$ and $O(1)$, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that
different layers can lie in different dynamical regimes in a training process
within a deep NN. In the condensed regime, we also observe the condensation of
weights in isolated orientations with low complexity. Through experiments under
three-layer condition, our phase diagram suggests a complicated dynamical
regimes consisting of three possible regimes, together with their mixture, for
deep NNs and provides a guidance for studying deep NNs in different
initialization regimes, which reveals the possibility of completely different
dynamics emerging within a deep NN for its different layers.

existing methods derived from the ones used for symmetric graphs can come with
sub-optimal guarantees. Due to increasing number of applications for bipartite

design optimal algorithms for this setting. The recent work of Ndaoud et al.

limitation by introducing a new algorithm based on the power method. We derive
conditions for exact recovery in the general setting where $K \neq L \geq 2$,

develop the expected excitonic magnetism but experiences two successive

moderate distortion of honeycomb lattice, and eventually to a high-pressure

sister compound Li$_2$RuO$_3$, the intermediate phase represents a
spin-orbit-coupled $J$-dimer state which is stabilized by the admixture of
upper-lying $J_{\rm eff} = 1$-derived states. We argue that the $J$-dimer state
is induced by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect associated with the low-lying

hybrid end-to-end control policy that combines the sparse expert driving
knowledge with reinforcement learning (RL) policy for autonomous driving (AD)
task in CARLA simulation environment. The sparse expert is designed based on
hand-crafted rules which is suboptimal but provides a risk-averse strategy by
enforcing experience for critical scenarios such as pedestrian and vehicle
avoidance, and traffic light detection. As it has been demonstrated, training a
RL agent from scratch is data-inefficient and time consuming particularly for
the urban driving task, due to the complexity of situations stemming from the
vast size of state space. Our SIRL strategy provides a solution to solve these
problems by fusing the output distribution of the sparse expert policy and the
RL policy to generate a composite driving policy. With the guidance of the
sparse expert during the early training stage, SIRL strategy accelerates the
training process and keeps the RL exploration from causing a catastrophe
outcome, and ensures safe exploration. To some extent, the SIRL agent is
imitating the driving expert's behavior. At the same time, it continuously
gains knowledge during training therefore it keeps making improvement beyond
the sparse expert, and can surpass both the sparse expert and a traditional RL
agent. We experimentally validate the efficacy of proposed SIRL approach in a
complex urban scenario within the CARLA simulator. Besides, we compare the SIRL
agent's performance for risk-averse exploration and high learning efficiency
with the traditional RL approach. We additionally demonstrate the SIRL agent's
generalization ability to transfer the driving skill to unseen environment.

lack of linearity of their quality estimates with respect to scores expressed
by human subjects. For this reason, usually IQA metrics undergo a calibration
process based on subjective quality examples. However, example-based training
makes generalization problematic, hampering result comparison across different
applications and operative conditions. In this paper, new Full Reference (FR)
techniques, providing estimates linearly correlated with human scores without
using calibration are introduced. To reach this objective, these techniques are
deeply rooted on principles and theoretical constraints. Restricting the
interest on the IQA of the set of natural images, it is first recognized that
application of estimation theory and psycho physical principles to images
degraded by Gaussian blur leads to a so-called canonical IQA method, whose
estimates are not only highly linearly correlated to subjective scores, but are
also straightforwardly related to the Viewing Distance (VD). Then, it is shown
that mainstream IQA methods can be reconducted to the canonical method applying
a preliminary metric conversion based on a unique specimen image. The
application of this scheme is then extended to a significant class of degraded
images other than Gaussian blur, including noisy and compressed images. The
resulting calibration-free FR IQA methods are suited for applications where
comparability and interoperability across different imaging systems and on
different VDs is a major requirement. A comparison of their statistical
performance with respect to some conventional calibration prone methods is
finally provided.

numerical simulation is expensive when the collision rate is high but finite,
as small time steps are then required. In this work, we present an
asymptotic-preserving multilevel Monte Carlo particle scheme that makes use of
this diffusive limit to accelerate computations. In this scheme, we first
sample the diffusive limiting model to compute a biased initial estimate of a
Quantity of Interest, using large time steps. We then perform a limited number
of finer simulations with transport and collision dynamics to correct the bias.
The efficiency of the multilevel method depends on being able to perform

deforestation across the globe is threatening the stability of our climate,
forest biodiversity, and therefore the preservation of fragile ecosystems and
our natural habitat as a whole. With increasing public interest in climate
change issues and forest preservation, a large demand for carbon offsetting,
carbon footprint ratings, and environmental impact assessments is emerging.
Most often, deforestation maps are created from optical data such as Landsat
and MODIS. These maps are not typically available at less than annual intervals
due to persistent cloud cover in many parts of the world, especially the
tropics where most of the world's forest biomass is concentrated. Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) can fill this gap as it penetrates clouds. We propose and
evaluate a novel method for deforestation detection in the absence of reliable
reference data which often constitutes the largest practical hurdle. This
method achieves a change detection sensitivity (producer's accuracy) of 96.5%
in the study area, although false positives lead to a lower user's accuracy of
about 75.7%, with a total balanced accuracy of 90.4%. The change detection
accuracy is maintained when adding up to 20% noise to the reference labels.
While further work is required to reduce the false positive rate, improve
detection delay, and validate this method in additional circumstances, the
results show that Sentinel-1 data have the potential to advance the timeliness
of global deforestation monitoring.

achieved by replacing the radio-frequency electromagnetic fields accelerating
the particles with fields in the optical frequency range, using lasers. This
entails using nanophotonics structures to provide the required field

electron transport through such a structure has been shown, which was based on
the concept of alternating phase focusing. In this contribution, we discuss and
augment on the recently-demonstrated principle of alternating phase focusing

and parasitic effects from time delay scans and discuss how the transmission of
electrons through the nanometric structure depends on the temporal overlap
between electron and laser pulses, and show how the incidence angle of the
electron beam can affect the measured transmission of electrons through the

to consider as a whole. They have become a norm in modern life and have been
applied to many real-world settings, such as product bundle recommendation,
music playlist recommendation and travel package recommendation. However,
compared to studies of bundle recommendation approaches in areas such as online
shopping and digital music services, research on meal recommendations for
restaurants in the hospitality industry has made limited progress, due largely
to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets. A publicly available dataset
specialising in meal recommendation research for the research community is in
urgent demand. In this paper, we introduce a meal recommendation dataset
(MealRec) that aims to facilitate future research. MealRec is constructed from
the user review records of Allrecipe.com, covering 1,500+ users, 7,200+ recipes
and 3,800+ meals. Each recipe is described with rich information, such as
ingredients, instructions, pictures, category and tags, etc; and each meal is
three-course, consisting of an appetizer, a main dish and a dessert.
Furthermore, we propose a category-constrained meal recommendation model that
is evaluated through comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art
bundle recommendation methods on MealRec. Experimental results confirm the
superiority of our model and demonstrate that MealRec is a promising testbed
for meal recommendation related research.

the outputs is slightly perturbed, SQAs could be easily misled and thereby
become much less effective. Following this idea, we propose a novel defense,
namely Adversarial Attack on Attackers (AAA), to confound SQAs towards
incorrect attack directions by slightly modifying the output logits. In this
way, (1) SQAs are prevented regardless of the model's worst-case robustness;
(2) the original model predictions are hardly changed, i.e., no degradation on
clean accuracy; (3) the calibration of confidence scores can be improved
simultaneously. Extensive experiments are provided to verify the above
advantages. For example, by setting $\ell_\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, our
proposed AAA helps WideResNet-28 secure 80.59% accuracy under Square attack
(2500 queries), while the best prior defense (i.e., adversarial training) only
attains 67.44%. Since AAA attacks SQA's general greedy strategy, such
advantages of AAA over 8 defenses can be consistently observed on 8
CIFAR-10/ImageNet models under 6 SQAs, using different attack targets, bounds,
norms, losses, and strategies. Moreover, AAA calibrates better without hurting
the accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/AAA.

information between the deep features of content and style images, which were
extracted by a pre-trained VGG, and achieved significant improvement in
synthesizing artistic images. However, in some cases, the feature statistics
from the pre-trained encoder may not be consistent with the visual style we
perceived. For example, the style distance between images of different styles
is less than that of the same style. In such an inappropriate latent space, the
objective function of the existing methods will be optimized in the wrong
direction, resulting in bad stylization results. In addition, the lack of
content details in the features extracted by the pre-trained encoder also leads
to the content leak problem. In order to solve these issues in the latent space
used by style transfer, we propose two contrastive training schemes to get a
refined encoder that is more suitable for this task. The style contrastive loss
pulls the stylized result closer to the same visual style image and pushes it
away from the content image. The content contrastive loss enables the encoder
to retain more available details. We can directly add our training scheme to
some existing style transfer methods and significantly improve their results.

reveal a steady increase in MPTCPv0-capable IPs, reaching 13k+ on IPv4
(2$\times$ increase in one year) and 1k on IPv6 (40$\times$ increase). MPTCPv1
deployment is comparatively low with $\approx$100 supporting hosts in IPv4 and

seemingly MPTCP-capable hosts, an artifact of middleboxes mirroring TCP
options. We conduct targeted HTTP(S) measurements towards select hosts and find
that middleboxes can aggressively impact the perceived quality of applications
utilizing MPTCP. Finally, we analyze two complementary traffic traces from

operations, e.g., min-plus convolution of two curves, to model how the traffic
profile changes with the traversal of network nodes. Such operations, while
mathematically well-defined, can quickly become unmanageable to compute using
simple pen and paper for any non-trivial case, hence the need for algorithmic
descriptions. Previous work identified the class of piecewise affine functions
which are ultimately pseudo-periodic (UPP) as being closed under the main NC
operations and able to be described finitely. Algorithms that embody NC
operations taking as operands UPP curves have been defined and proved correct,
thus enabling software implementations of these operations. However, recent
advancements in NC make use of operations, namely the lower pseudo-inverse,
upper pseudo-inverse, and composition, that are well defined from an algebraic

paper, we introduce algorithms for the above operations when operands are UPP

a nonmonotonic dependence on the energy with a local minimum around 17-22 keV.
Phase lags in one of the pulse profile components, reaching the maximal value
approximately at the same energy, were discovered. The pulse phase-averaged
spectrum of the source has a power-law shape with an exponential cutoff at high

revealed the presence of a pulse phase-transient cyclotron absorption line at

distributed training method, to person ReID. FedReID preserves data privacy by
aggregating model updates, instead of raw data, from clients to a central
server. Furthermore, we optimize the performance of FedReID under statistical
heterogeneity via benchmark analysis. We first construct a benchmark with an
enhanced algorithm, two architectures, and nine person ReID datasets with large
variances to simulate the real-world statistical heterogeneity. The benchmark
results present insights and bottlenecks of FedReID under statistical
heterogeneity, including challenges in convergence and poor performance on
datasets with large volumes. Based on these insights, we propose three
optimization approaches: (1) We adopt knowledge distillation to facilitate the
convergence of FedReID by better transferring knowledge from clients to the
server; (2) We introduce client clustering to improve the performance of large
datasets by aggregating clients with similar data distributions; (3) We propose
cosine distance weight to elevate performance by dynamically updating the
weights for aggregation depending on how well models are trained in clients.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that these approaches achieve satisfying
convergence with much better performance on all datasets. We believe that

and $dormant$ individuals are structured in colonies labelled by
$\mathbb{Z}^d,~d\geq 1$. The population sizes are drawn from an ergodic,
translation-invariant, uniformly elliptic field that form a random environment.
Individuals carry one of two types: $\heartsuit$, $\spadesuit$. Dormant
individual resides in what is called a seed-bank. Active individuals exchange
type from seed-bank of their own colony and resample type by choosing parent
from the active populations according to a symmetric migration kernel. In den
Hollander and Nandan (2021) by using a dual (an interacting coalescing particle
system), we showed that the spatial system exhibits a dichotomy between
$clustering$ (mono-type equilibrium) and $coexistence$ (multi-type
equilibrium). In this paper we identify the domain of attraction for each
mono-type equilibrium in the clustering regime for a $fixed$ environment. We
also show that when the migration kernel is $recurrent$, for a.e. realization
of the environment, the system with an initially $consistent$ type distribution
converges weakly to a mono-type equilibrium in which the fixation probability
to type-$\heartsuit$ configuration does not depend on the environment. A
formula for the fixation probability is given in terms of an annealed average
of type-$\heartsuit$ densities in dormant and active population biased by ratio
of the two population sizes at the target colony.
  For the proofs, we use duality and environment seen by particle introduced in
Dolgopyat and Goldsheid (2019) for RWRE on a strip. A spectral analysis of
Markov operator yields quenched weak convergence of the environment process
associated with single-particle dual to a reversible ergodic distribution which
we transfer to the spatial system by using duality.

  Damage Analysis",,,,,"cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Concurrent multiscale damage models are often used to quantify the impacts of
manufacturing-induced micro porosity on the damage response of macroscopic
metallic components. However, these models are challenged by major numerical
issues including mesh dependency, convergence difficulty, and low accuracy in
concentration regions. We make two contributions that collectively aim to
address these difficulties. Firstly, we develop a novel adaptive assembly free
impl-exp (AAF-IE) temporal integration scheme for nonlinear constitutive
models. This scheme prevents the convergence issues that arise when implicit
algorithms are employed to model softening. Our AAF-IE scheme autonomously
adjusts step sizes to capture intricate history dependent deformations. It also
dispenses with reassembling the stiffness matrices amid runtime for
elasto-plasticity and damage models which, in turn, dramatically reduces memory
footprints. Secondly, we propose an adaptive clustering-based domain
decomposition strategy to dramatically reduce the spatial degrees of freedom by
agglomerating close-by finite element nodes into a limited number of clusters.
Our adaptive clustering scheme has static and dynamic stages that are carried
out during offline and online analyses, respectively. The adaptive strategy
determines the cluster density based on spatial discontinuity and controls
adaptive clusters via field estimations. As demonstrated by numerical
experiments the proposed adaptive method strikes a good balance between
efficiency and accuracy for fracture simulations. In particular, we use our
efficient concurrent multiscale model to quantify the significance of spatially
varying microscopic porosity on a macrostructural softening behavior.

account for non-linearities of the propagation medium and to cover, as special
cases, important fading scenarios such as Rayleigh and exponential models.
Performance metrics such as the outage probability (OP) and the average bit

Interestingly, our results indicate that, except for the first user (nearest

solely on the user's power allocation coefficient and on the type of

successively receives the average of the features of its neighbors. Indeed, it
has quickly been observed that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generally
follow some variant of Message-Passing (MP) with repeated aggregation, may be
subject to the oversmoothing phenomenon: by performing too many rounds of MP,
the node features tend to converge to a non-informative limit. In the case of
mean aggregation, for connected graphs, the node features become constant
across the whole graph. At the other end of the spectrum, it is intuitively
obvious that some MP rounds are necessary, but existing analyses do not exhibit
both phenomena at once: beneficial ``finite'' smoothing and oversmoothing in
the limit. In this paper, we consider simplified linear GNNs, and rigorously
analyze two examples for which a finite number of mean aggregation steps
provably improves the learning performance, before oversmoothing kicks in. We
consider a latent space random graph model, where node features are partial
observations of the latent variables and the graph contains pairwise
relationships between them. We show that graph smoothing restores some of the
lost information, up to a certain point, by two phenomenon: graph smoothing
shrinks non-principal directions in the data faster than principal ones, which
is useful for regression, and shrinks nodes within communities faster than they
collapse together, which improves classification.

multiscale damage simulations which typically ignore the manufacturing-induced
spatial variabilities in porosity. This simplification is made because of the
prohibitive computational expenses of explicitly modeling spatially varying
microstructures in a macroscopic part. To address this challenge and open the
doors for fracture-aware design of multiscale materials, we propose a
data-driven framework that integrates a mechanistic reduced-order model (ROM)
with a calibration scheme based on random processes. Our ROM drastically
accelerates direct numerical simulations (DNS) by using a stabilized damage
algorithm and systematically reducing the degrees of freedom via clustering.
Since clustering affects local strain fields and hence the fracture response,
we calibrate the ROM by constructing a multi-fidelity random process based on
latent map Gaussian processes (LMGPs). In particular, we use LMGPs to calibrate
the damage parameters of an ROM as a function of microstructure and clustering
(i.e., fidelity) level such that the ROM faithfully surrogates DNS. We
demonstrate the application of our framework in predicting the damage behavior
of a multiscale metallic component with spatially varying porosity. Our results
indicate that microstructural porosity can significantly affect the performance
of macro components and hence must be considered in the design process.

it employs synthetic apertures to codify spatial and spectral information,
sensing only 2D projections of the 3D spectral image. However, these optical
architectures suffer from a trade-off between the spatial and spectral
resolution of the reconstructed image due to technology limitations. To
overcome this issue, compressive spectral image fusion (CSIF) employs the
projected measurements of two CSI architectures with different resolutions to
estimate a high-spatial high-spectral resolution. This work presents the fusion
of the compressive measurements of a low-spatial high-spectral resolution coded
aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) architecture and a high-spatial
low-spectral resolution multispectral color filter array (MCFA) system. Unlike
previous CSIF works, this paper proposes joint optimization of the sensing
architectures and a reconstruction network in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. The
trainable optical parameters are the coded aperture (CA) in the CASSI and the
colored coded aperture in the MCFA system, employing a sigmoid activation
function and regularization function to encourage binary values on the
trainable variables for an implementation purpose. Additionally, an
unrolling-based network inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) optimization is formulated to address the reconstruction
step and the acquisition systems design jointly. Finally, a spatial-spectral
inspired loss function is employed at the end of each unrolling layer to
increase the convergence of the unrolling network. The proposed method
outperforms previous CSIF methods, and experimental results validate the method

structural health monitoring and non-destructive evaluation, thanks to some
distinct advantages. Guided waves, in particular Lamb waves, can be used to
localise damage by utilising prior knowledge of propagation and reflection
characteristics. Typical localisation methods make use of the time of arrival
of waves emitted or reflected from the damage, the simplest of which involves
triangulation. It is useful to decompose the measured signal into the expected
waves propagating directly from the actuation source in the absence of damage,
and for this paper referred to as nominal waves. This decomposition allows for
determination of waves reflected from damage, boundaries or other local
inhomogeneities. Previous decomposition methods make use of accurate analytical
models, but there is a gap in methods of decomposition for complex materials
and structures. A new method is shown here which uses a Bayesian approach to
decompose single-source signals, which has the advantage of quantification of
the uncertainty of the expected signal. Furthermore, the approach produces
inherent parametric features which correlate to known physics of guided waves.
In this paper, the decomposition method is demonstrated on data from a
simulation of guided wave propagation in a small aluminium plate, using the
local interaction simulation approach, for a damaged and undamaged case.
Analysis of the decomposition method is done in three ways; inspect individual
decomposed signals, track the inherently produced parametric features along
propagation distance, and use method in a localisation strategy. The Bayesian
decomposition was found to work well for the assessment criteria mentioned
above. The use of these waves in the localisation method returned estimates
accurate to within 1mm in many sensor configurations.

processes, we built some laser control strategies inspired from basic
mechanisms such as interference and kicks, and apply them to the case of
pyrazine. We are studying the internal conversion between the two excited
states, the highest and directly reachable from the initial ground state being
considered as a donor, and the lowest as an acceptor. The ultimate control
objective is the maximum population deposit in the otherwise dark acceptor,
from a two-step process: radiative excitation of the donor, followed by a
conical-intersection-mediated funneling towards the acceptor. The overall idea
is to first obtain the control field parameters (individual pulses leading
frequency and intensity, duration and inter-pulse time delay) for tractable
reduced dimensional models basically describing the conical intersection
branching space. Once these parameters are optimized, they are fixed and used
in full dimensional dynamics describing the electronic population transfer. In
the case of pyrazine, the reduced model is 4 dimensional, whereas the full
dynamics involve 24 vibrational modes. Within experimentally achievable
electromagnetic field requirements, we obtain a robust control with about 60 %
of the ground state population deposited in the acceptor state, while about 16
% remains in the donor. Moreover, we anticipate a possible transposition to the
control of even larger molecular systems, for which only a small number of
normal modes are active, among all the others acting as spectators in the

Systems, which we consider in this work, is sparsely connected and moderately
sized (on the order of thousands of qubits), thus necessitating a
minor-embedding of a logical problem onto the physical qubit hardware. The
combination of relatively small hardware sizes and the necessity of a
minor-embedding can mean that solving large optimization problems is not
possible on current quantum annealers. In this research, we show that a hybrid
approach combining parallel quantum annealing with graph decomposition allows
one to solve larger optimization problem accurately. We apply the approach on
the Maximum Clique problem on graphs with up to 120 nodes and 6395 edges.

assumed oversimplified wireless communications models and can only work for
small-scale settings. In this work, we consider remote estimation systems with
practical wireless models over the orthogonal multiple-access and
non-orthogonal multiple-access schemes. We derive necessary and sufficient
conditions under which remote estimation systems can be stabilized. The
conditions are described in terms of the transmission power budget, channel
statistics, and plants' parameters. For each multiple-access scheme, we
formulate a novel dynamic resource allocation problem as a decision-making
problem for achieving the minimum overall long-term average estimation
mean-square error. Both the estimation quality and the channel quality states
are taken into account for decision making. We systematically investigated the
problems under different multiple-access schemes with large discrete, hybrid
discrete-and-continuous, and continuous action spaces, respectively. We propose
novel action-space compression methods and develop advanced deep reinforcement

compare statistical methods for vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimation, we
generated simulated data using a multiscale agent-based model of an epidemic
with an acute viral infection and differing extents of VE waning. We extended
the previously proposed framework for VE measures based on the observational
data richness to assess changes of vaccine-induced protection with time. While
VE measures based on hard-to-collect information (e.g. exact timing of
exposures) were accurate, usually VE studies rely on time-to-infection data and
the Cox proportional hazard model. We found that its extension utilizing scaled
Schoenfeld residuals, previously proposed for capturing VE waning, was
unreliable in capturing both the degree of waning and its functional form and
identified the mathematical factors contributing to this unreliability. We
showed that partitioning time and including a time-vaccine interaction term in
the Cox model significantly improved estimation of VE waning, even in the case
of dramatic, rapid waning. We also proposed how to optimize the partitioning
scheme. Using simulated data, we compared different measures of VE for
capturing the intra-seasonal waning of vaccine-induced protection. We propose
an extension of the Cox model based on including a time-vaccine interaction

numbers are derived using the next generation operator approach. The
mathematical analysis of the model reveals that in the absence of mites, the
colony survives if the mite-free reproduction number is greater than unity
otherwise it goes extinct. Stability and sensitivity analyses of the model
reveal that the egg laying rate of the queen bee is key in regulating mite
reproduction. Adult bee grooming and hygienic behavior of worker bees have also
been shown to play a vital role in reducing parasitism. Using the
Volterra-Lyapunov stable matrix approach, the mite-infested equilibrium is
confirmed to be globally asymptotically stable when the mite-free reproduction
number is greater than unity and the mite reproduction number is greater than
unity. It is also shown that varroa mite control strategies that focus on
limiting mite-reproduction such as caging the queen bee and using a young queen
bee quickly reduces the mite reproduction number to a value less than unity
compared to those that are intended to kill the mites.

frequently associated with the emergence of magnetic flux from the convection
zone into the corona. We use three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical
simulations to study the interaction of coronal magnetic fields with emerging
flux and determine the conditions that lead to eruptive activity. A simple
parameter study is performed, varying the relative angle between emerging
magnetic flux and a pre-existing coronal dipole field. We find that in all
cases, the emergence results in a sheared magnetic arcade that transitions to a
twisted coronal flux rope via low-lying magnetic reconnection. This structure,
however, is constrained by its own outer field, and so is non-eruptive in the
absence of reconnection with the overlying coronal field. The amount of this
overlying reconnection is determined by the relative angle between the emerged
and pre-existing fields. The reconnection between emerging and pre-existing
fields is necessary to generate sufficient expansion of the emerging structure
so that flare-like reconnection below the coronal flux rope becomes strong
enough to trigger its release. Our results imply that the relative angle is the
key parameter in determining whether the resultant active regions exhibit
eruptive behavior, and is thus a potentially useful candidate for predicting
eruptions in newly emerging active regions. More generally, our results
demonstrate that the detailed interaction between the convection
zone/photosphere and the corona must be calculated self-consistently in order

networks, where edges between actors are either positive or negative. For
instance, schoolchildren can be friends or rivals, just as countries can
cooperate or fight each other. This research often builds on structural balance
theory, one of the earliest and most prominent network theories, making signed
networks one of the most frequently studied matters in social network analysis.
While the theorization and description of signed networks have thus made
significant progress, the inferential study of tie formation within them
remains limited in the absence of appropriate statistical models. In this paper
we fill this gap by proposing the Signed Exponential Random Graph Model
(SERGM), extending the well-known Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to
networks where ties are not binary but negative or positive if a tie exists.
Since most networks are dynamically evolving systems, we specify the model for
both cross-sectional and dynamic networks. Based on structural hypotheses
derived from structural balance theory, we formulate interpretable signed
network statistics, capturing dynamics such as ""the enemy of my enemy is my
friend"". In our empirical application, we use the SERGM to analyze cooperation

interstellar medium (ISM) in the evolution of galaxies. We simulate the RC
surface brightness of present-day star forming galaxies in the past at
$0.15<z<3$ considering two cases of radio size evolution: (1)~no evolution, and
(2)~same evolution as in the optical. We aim to investigate the a)~structure of
the thermal and nonthermal emission on kpc scales, b)~evolution of the thermal
fraction and synchrotron spectrum at mid-radio frequencies ($\simeq$1-10\,GHz),
and c)~capability of the proposed SKA1-MID reference surveys in detecting the
RC emitting structures. The synchrotron spectrum flattens with $z$ causing
curvature in the observed mid-radio SEDs of galaxies at higher $z$. The
spectral index reported in recent observational studies agrees better with the
no size evolution scenario. In this case, the mean thermal fraction observed at
1.4\,GHz increases with redshift by more than 30\% from $z=0.15$ to $z=2$
because of the drop of the synchrotron emission at higher
rest-frame~frequencies. More massive galaxies have lower thermal fractions and
experience a faster flattening of the nonthermal spectrum. The proposed
SKA1-MID band~2 reference survey, unveils the ISM in M51- and NGC6946-like
galaxies (with ${\rm M_{\star}}\simeq10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) up to $z=3$.
This survey detects lower-mass galaxies like M33 (${\rm
M_{\star}}\simeq10^{9}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) only at low redshifts $z\lesssim
0.5$. For a proper separation of the RC emitting processes at the peak of star
formation, it is vital to include band~1 into the SKA1-MID reference surveys.

constitutes a potentially powerful tool for finding novel solutions to the

selectively bind to a specific protein is highly challenging and costly.
Drug-target affinity (DTA), which represents the strength of drug-target
interaction (DTI), has played an important role in the DTI prediction task over
the past decade. Although deep learning has been applied to DTA-related
research, existing solutions ignore fundamental correlations between molecular
substructures in molecular representation learning of drug compound
molecules/protein targets. Moreover, traditional methods lack the
interpretability of the DTA prediction process. This results in missing feature
information of intermolecular interactions, thereby affecting prediction
performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a DTA prediction method with
interactive learning and an autoencoder mechanism. The proposed model enhances
the corresponding ability to capture the feature information of a single
molecular sequence by the drug/protein molecular representation learning module
and supplements the information interaction between molecular sequence pairs by
the interactive information learning module. The DTA value prediction module
fuses the drug-target pair interaction information to output the predicted
value of DTA. Additionally, this paper theoretically proves that the proposed
method maximizes evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the joint distribution of the
DTA prediction model, which enhances the consistency of the probability
distribution between the actual value and the predicted value. The experimental
results confirm mutual transformer-drug target affinity (MT-DTA) achieves
better performance than other comparative methods.

attempts of crystallizing non-single-crystal thin films; however, it merely
results in the formation of poly-crystal thin films. In this paper, selective
area crystallization of non-single-crystal copper(II) oxide (CuO) is described.
The crystallization is induced by laser, laser-induced crystallization, with a
beam profile in the shape of chevron. The crystallization is verified by the
exhibition of a transition from a non-single-crystal phase consisting of small
100 nm x 100 nm grains of CuO to a single-crystal phase of copper(I) oxide
(Cu2O). The transition is identified by electron back scattering diffraction
and Raman spectroscopy, which clearly suggests that a single-crystal domain of
Cu2O with size as large as 5 {\mu}m x 1 mm develops. Provided these
experimental findings, a theoretical assessment based on a cellular automaton
model, with the behaviors of localized recrystallization and stochastic
nucleation, is developed. The theoretical assessment can qualitatively describe
the laser beam geometry-dependence of vital observable features (e.g., size and
gross geometry of grains) in the laser-induced crystallization. The theoretical
assessment predicts that differences in resulting crystallinity, either
single-crystal or poly-crystal, primarily depend on a geometrical profile with
which melting of non-single-crystal regions takes place along the laser scan
direction; concave-trailing profiles yield larger grains which lead to
single-crystal while convex-trailing profiles results in smaller grains which
lead to poly-crystal, casting light on the fundamental question Why does a
chevron-beam profile succeed in producing single-crystal while a Gaussian-beam
profile fails?
