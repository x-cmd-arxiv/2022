theory for an action of a real reductive group $G$ on a real submanifold $X$ of
a K\""ahler manifold $Z$. More precisely, we suppose the action of a compact
connected Lie group $U$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{u}$ extends holomorphically
to an action of the complexified group $U^{\mathbb C}$ and that the $U$-action
on $Z$ is Hamiltonian. If $G\subset U^{\mathbb C}$ is closed and compatible,
there is a corresponding gradient map $\mu_\mathfrak{p} : X\longrightarrow
\mathfrak{p}$, where $\mathfrak g = \mathfrak k \oplus \mathfrak p$ is a Cartan
decomposition of the Lie algebra of $G$. The concept of energy complete action
of $G$ on $X$ is introduced. For such actions, one can characterize stability,
semistability and polystability of a point by a numerical criteria using a
$G$-equivariant function associated with a gradient map, called maximal weight
function. We also prove the classical Hilbert-Mumford criteria for semistabilty
and polystability conditions.

insulator-to-metal transition in correlated electronic systems, most notably
charge-density-wave (CDW) materials and Mott insulators, driven
far-from-equilibrium by a DC electric field. By introducing a generic model of
electrons coupled to an inelastic medium of phonons, we demonstrate that an
electron avalanche can occur in the bulk limit of such insulators at
arbitrarily small electric field. The quantum avalanche arises by the
generation of a ladder of in-gap states, created by a multi-phonon emission
process. Hot-phonons in the avalanche trigger a premature and partial collapse
of the correlated gap. The details of the phonon spectrum dictate two-stage
versus single-stage mechanisms which we associate with CDW and Mott resistive
transitions, respectively. The electron and phonon temperatures, as well as the
temperature dependence of the threshold fields, point to the quantum nature of
this nonequilibrium phase transition.

distinguishing the effect of spanwise and cross-span oriented vortex structures
on pressure-induced lift production. We quantify the lift induced on the wing
by these different vortices, and also estimate their influence within different
regions of the flow-field around the wing and in the wake. By varying the
aspect-ratio and angle-of-attack of the wing, we show that for most cases, the
spanwise oriented vorticity contributes less to the total lift than cross-span
oriented vortices. Furthermore, the spanwise vorticity in the near wake is
capable of producing net negative lift on the wing and this is explained by
separating and quantifying the influence of vortex cores and regions of strain
in the wake. The results demonstrate the utility of the force partitioning
method for dissecting the flow physics of vortex dominated flows.

for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. When the
integration domain of the potential is irregular and is discretized by an
unstructured mesh, the function spaces of near field and self-interactions are
non-compact, and, thus, their computations cannot be easily accelerated. In
this paper, we propose three novel and complementary techniques for
accelerating the evaluation of potentials over unstructured meshes. Firstly, we
rigorously characterize the geometry of the near field, and show that this
analysis can be used to eliminate all the unnecessary near field interaction
computations. Secondly, as the near field can be made arbitrarily small by
increasing the order of the far field quadrature rule, the expensive near field
interaction computation can be efficiently offloaded onto the FMM-based far
field interaction computation, which leverages the computational efficiency of
highly optimized parallel FMM libraries. Finally, we show that a separate
interpolation mesh that is staggered to the quadrature mesh dramatically
reduces the cost of constructing the interpolants. Besides these contributions,
we present a robust and extensible framework for the evaluation and
interpolation of 2-D volume potentials over complicated geometries. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques with several numerical
experiments.

microchannel containing a constriction. The phenomenon is driven by the
pervaporation of the liquid present in the channel through the surrounding
medium. The penetration is intermittent, jerky, and characterised by a
stop-and-go dynamics as the bubble escapes the constriction. We demonstrate
that this sequence of arrest and jump of the bubble is due to an
elastocapillary coupling between the air-liquid interface and the elastic
medium. When the interface enters the constriction, its curvature strongly
increases, leading to a depression within the liquid-filled channel which
drives a compression of the channel. As the interface is forced to leave the
constriction at a given threshold, due to the ongoing loss of liquid content by
pervaporation, the pressure is suddenly released, which gives rise to a rapid
propagation of the air bubbles away from the constriction and a restoration of
the rest shape of the channel. Combining macroscopic observations and confocal
imaging, we present a comprehensive experimental study of this phenomenon. In
particular, the effect of the channel geometry on the time of arrest in the
constriction and the jump length is investigated. Our novel microfluidic design
succeeds in mimicking the role of inter-vessel pits in plants, which
transiently stop the propagation of air embolism during long and severe
droughts. It is expected to serve as a building block for further biomimetic
studies in more complex leaf-like architectures, in order to recover this
universal phenomena of intermittent propagation reported in real leaves.

critical privacy concerns as these devices can access a variety of sensitive
data. The current status quo of relying on manufacturers' cloud services to
process this data is especially problematic since users cede control once their
data leaves their home. Multiple recent incidents further call into question if
vendors can indeed be trusted with users' data. At the same time, users desire
compelling features supported by IoT devices and ML-based cloud inferences
which compels them to subscribe to manufacturer-managed cloud services. An
alternative to use a local in-home hub requires substantial hardware
investment, management, and scalability limitations. This paper proposes
Self-Serviced IoT (SSIoT), a clean-slate approach of using a hybrid hub-cloud
setup to enable privacy-aware computation offload for IoT applications.
Uniquely, SSIoT enables opportunistic computation offload to public cloud
providers while still ensuring that the end-user retains complete end-to-end
control of their private data reducing the trust required from public cloud
providers. We show that SSIoT can leverage emerging function-as-a-service
computation (e.g. AWS Lambda) to make these offloads cost-efficient, scalable
and high performance as long as key limitations of being stateless, limited
resources, and security isolation can be addressed. We build an end-to-end
prototype of SSIoT and evaluate it using several micro-benchmarks and example
applications representing real-world IoT use cases. Our results show that SSIoT
is highly scalable, as compared to local-only approaches which struggle with as
little as 2-4 apps in parallel. We also show that SSIoT is cost-efficient
(operating a smart doorbell for $10 a year) at the cost of minimal additional
latency as compared to a local-only hub, even with a hardware ML accelerator.

the LEPHARE $\chi^{2}$ minimisation SED-fitting routine. We find excellent
agreement between the regions of enhanced intrinsic reddening across the
central (4x4 deg$^2$) region of the LMC and the morphology of the low-level
pervasive dust emission as traced by far-IR emission. In addition, we are able
to distinguish smaller, isolated enhancements that are coincident with known
star-forming regions and the clustering of young stars observed in morphology
maps. The level of reddening associated with the molecular ridge south of 30
Doradus is, however, smaller than in the literature reddening maps. The reduced
number of galaxies detected in this region, due to high extinction and
crowding, may bias our results towards lower reddening values. Our map is
consistent with maps derived from red clump stars and from the analysis of the
star formation history across the LMC. This study represents one of the first
large-scale categorisations of extragalactic sources behind the LMC and as such

witnessing an increasing number of backdoor injection attacks that are designed
to maliciously threaten Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) causing misclassification.
Although there exist various defense methods that can effectively erase
backdoors from DNNs, they greatly suffer from both high Attack Success Rate
(ASR) and a non-negligible loss in Benign Accuracy (BA). Inspired by the
observation that a backdoored DNN tends to form a new cluster in its feature
spaces for poisoned data, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage backdoor
defense method, named MCLDef, based on Model-Contrastive Learning (MCL). In the
first stage, our approach performs trigger inversion based on trigger
synthesis, where the resultant trigger can be used to generate poisoned data.
In the second stage, under the guidance of MCL and our defined positive and
negative pairs, MCLDef can purify the backdoored model by pulling the feature
representations of poisoned data towards those of their clean data
counterparts. Due to the shrunken cluster of poisoned data, the backdoor formed
by end-to-end supervised learning is eliminated. Comprehensive experimental
results show that, with only 5% of clean data, MCLDef significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art defense methods by up to 95.79% reduction in ASR, while in
most cases the BA degradation can be controlled within less than 2%. Our code

priors based on Whittle--Mat\'ern Gaussian random fields. The Whittle--Mat\'ern
prior is characterized by a mean function and a covariance operator that is
taken as a negative power of an elliptic differential operator. This approach
is flexible in that it can incorporate a wide range of prior information
including non-stationary effects, but it is currently computationally
advantageous only for integer values of the exponent. In this paper, we derive
an efficient method for handling all admissible noninteger values of the
exponent. The method first discretizes the covariance operator using finite
elements and quadrature, and uses preconditioned Krylov subspace solvers for
shifted linear systems to efficiently apply the resulting covariance matrix to
a vector. This approach can be used for generating samples from the
distribution in two different ways: by solving a stochastic partial
differential equation, and by using a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion. We
show how to incorporate this prior representation into the infinite-dimensional
Bayesian formulation, and show how to efficiently compute the maximum a
posteriori estimate, and approximate the posterior variance. Although the focus
of this paper is on Bayesian inverse problems, the techniques developed here
are applicable to solving systems with fractional Laplacians and Gaussian
random fields. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance and
scalability of the solvers and their applicability to model and real-data
inverse problems in tomography and a time-dependent heat equation.

solar cycle variation observationally in more detail can give us clues about
how to resolve the controversies. We investigate the solar cycle variation of
the most magnetically quiet regions and their surface gravity oscillation
($f$-) mode integrated energy ($E_f$). We use 12 years of HMI data and apply a
stringent selection criteria, based on spatial and temporal quietness, to avoid
any influence of active regions (ARs). We develop an automated high-throughput
pipeline to go through all available magnetogram data and to compute $E_f$ for
the selected quiet regions. We observe a clear solar cycle dependence of the
magnetic field strength in the most quiet regions containing several
supergranular cells. For patch sizes smaller than a supergranular cell, no
significant cycle dependence is detected. The $E_f$ at the supergranular scale
is not constant over time. During the late ascending phase of Cycle 24 (SC24,
2011-2012), it is roughly constant, but starts diminishing in 2013, as the
maximum of SC24 is approached. This trend continues until mid-2017, when hints
of strengthening at higher southern latitudes are seen. Slow strengthening
continues, stronger at higher latitudes than at the equatorial regions, but
$E_f$ never returns back to the values seen in 2011-2012. Also, the
strengthening trend continues past the solar minimum, to the years when SC25 is
already clearly ascending. Hence the $E_f$ behavior is not in phase with the
solar cycle. The anticorrelation of $E_f$ with the solar cycle in gross terms
is expected, but the phase shift of several years indicates a connection to the
poloidal large-scale magnetic field component rather than the toroidal one.
Calibrating AR signals with the QS $E_f$ does not reveal significant
enhancement of the $f$-mode prior to AR emergence.

it is natural to ask whether graphs excluding the basic treewidth obstructions

this question in the negative. Their counterexamples, the so-called ""layered

high-dimensional spaces under dynamic constraints. However, when facing complex
configuration spaces, cluttered with obstacles, roboticists typically fall back
to sampling-based planners that struggle in very high dimensions and with
continuous differential constraints. Indeed, obstacles are the source of many
textbook examples of problematic nonconvexities in the trajectory-optimization
problem. Here we show that convex optimization can, in fact, be used to
reliably plan trajectories around obstacles. Specifically, we consider planning
problems with collision-avoidance constraints, as well as cost penalties and
hard constraints on the shape, the duration, and the velocity of the
trajectory. Combining the properties of B\'ezier curves with a
recently-proposed framework for finding shortest paths in Graphs of Convex Sets
(GCS), we formulate the planning problem as a compact mixed-integer
optimization. In stark contrast with existing mixed-integer planners, the
convex relaxation of our programs is very tight, and a cheap rounding of its
solution is typically sufficient to design globally-optimal trajectories. This
reduces the mixed-integer program back to a simple convex optimization, and
automatically provides optimality bounds for the planned trajectories. We name
the proposed planner GCS, after its underlying optimization framework. We
demonstrate GCS in simulation on a variety of robotic platforms, including a
quadrotor flying through buildings and a dual-arm manipulator (with fourteen
degrees of freedom) moving in a confined space. Using numerical experiments on
a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator, we show that GCS can outperform
widely-used sampling-based planners by finding higher-quality trajectories in
less time.

The use of a $V$-level system allows for an efficient closed lasing cycle to be

repumping. This is made possible by utilizing an additional dipole-allowed
transition. We determine the lasing threshold and emission frequency by
performing a stability analysis of the non-lasing solution. In the lasing
regime, we use a mean-field Floquet method (MFFM) to calculate the lasing

be accompanied by the breaking of a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry in a single
Fourier component of the total field. In addition, we use the MFFM to derive
bistable lasing and non-lasing solutions that highlight the non-linear nature

substantial commercial value, multi-truck vehicle routing for supply chain
logistics, at the scale used by a corporation in their operations. Such a
problem is too complex to be fully embedded on any near-term quantum hardware
or simulator; we avoid confronting this challenge by taking a hybrid workflow
approach: we iteratively assign routes for trucks by generating a new binary
optimization problem instance one truck at a time. Each instance has $\sim
2500$ quadratic binary variables, putting it in a range that is feasible for
NISQ quantum computing, especially quantum annealing hardware. We test our
methods using simulated annealing and the D-Wave Hybrid solver as a
place-holder in wait of quantum hardware developments. After feeding the
vehicle routes suggested by these runs into a highly realistic classical supply
chain simulation, we find excellent performance for the full supply chain. Our
work gives a set of techniques that can be adopted in contexts beyond vehicle
routing to apply NISQ devices in a hybrid fashion to large-scale problems of
commercial interest.

Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an
overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between
neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a
same-task pre-training strategy to exploit the potential of the model for
further improvement. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the

plasma fusion gain Qplasma = 17, a net gain Qnet = 1.3, a cost of electricity
(COE) of \$ 1148 (2021 US) per MWh (at 75 % availability) and high temperature
superconducting operational TF magnets producing 5.4 T on-axis and 12.5 T

large tokamaks may eventually dominate the commercial market. We consider a
range of designs optimised for capital cost (as the reactors considered are
pilot plants) consisting of both 100 MWe and 500 MWe plants with each of two
approaches for the magnets: training and upgrading. With training magnets, the
plant is cost-optimised for REBCO TF magnets. For a 100 MWe plant, the Nb-Ti
training magnets typically produce 70 % peak field on the toroidal field coils

approx. 10 % of the total machine cost. Training magnets could in principle be

augmentation is a way to increase the diversity of available data by applying
constrained transformations on the original data. One such technique, which has
positively contributed to various classification tasks, is Mixup. According to
this, a DNN is trained on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their

It shows anti-correlation at small separations, s < 200 AU for the thin-disk

high-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds. It
reveals that the randomization of the wave field is multiscale: The travel time
of the wave front is randomized at short distances of propagation and it can be
described by a fractional Brownian motion. The wave field observed in the
random travel time frame is affected by the random perturbations at long

when the source is in the hard state, consistent with an X-ray irradiated
accretion disk with an additional contribution from the viscous disk during the

multiple particles. The scheme relies on using programmable optical tweezers to
provide full independent control over trap frequency and position of each

demonstrate its scalability by simultaneously cooling the motion of two

(hard) binaries, a continuous mass spectrum, differential rotation, and tidal
mass loss induced by the overall gravitational field of the host galaxy. We
explore the impact of rotation and stellar evolution on the star cluster
dynamics. In all runs for rotating star clusters we detect a previously
predicted mechanism: an initial phase of violent relaxation followed by the
so-called gravogyro catastrophe. We find that the gravogyro catastrophe reaches
a finite amplitude, which depends in strength on the level of the bulk
rotation, and then levels off. After this phase the angular momentum is
transferred from high-mass to low-mass particles in the cluster (both stars and
compact objects). Simultaneously, the system becomes gravothermally unstable
and collapses, thus undergoing the so-called gravothermal-gravogyro
catastrophe. Comparing models with and without stellar evolution, we find an
interesting difference. When stellar evolution is not taken into account, the
whole process proceeds at a faster pace. The population of heavy objects tend
to form a triaxial structure that rotates in the cluster centre. When stellar
evolution is taken into account, we find that such a {\it rotating bar} is
populated by stellar black holes and their progenitors. The triaxial structure
becomes axisymmetric over time, but we also find that the models without
stellar evolution suffer repeated gravogyro catastrophes as sufficient angular
momentum and mass are removed by the tidal field.

models feature potentials with smooth large-field plateaus together with
small-field features that can induce a brief phase of ultra-slow-roll
evolution. Inflationary dynamics within this family of models yield predictions
for observables in close agreement with recent measurements, such as the
spectral index of primordial curvature perturbations and the ratio of power
spectra for tensor to scalar perturbations. As in previous studies of PBH
formation resulting from a period of ultra-slow-roll inflation, we find that at

provided to the algorithm. We find two primary scales in the initial conditions
(ICs) that impact the final mass profile: the density at approximately the
scale of the haloes' Lagrangian patch $R_L$ ($R\sim 0.7\, R_L$) and that in the
large-scale environment ($R\sim 1.7~R_L$). The model also identifies three
primary time-scales in the halo assembly history that affect the final profile:
(i) the formation time of the virialized, collapsed material inside the halo,
(ii) the dynamical time, which captures the dynamically unrelaxed, infalling
component of the halo over its first orbit, (iii) a third, most recent
time-scale, which captures the impact on the outer profile of recent massive

cluster in a merging system, which is well known for X-ray hot gas sloshing in
its core. The sharply peaked X-ray profile of A1644-S implies the presence of a
strongly cooling gas core. In this study, we analyze ALMA CO (1-0) data, JVLA
HI data, and KaVA 22 GHz data for the central region of A1644-S to probe the
potential origin of the cool gas and its role in (re)powering the central
active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find CO clumps distributed in an arc shape
along the X-ray gas sloshing, which is suggestive of a connection between the
cold gas and the hot intracluster medium (ICM). HI and CN are detected in
absorption against the AGN continuum emission. The absorption dip is observed
at the systemic velocity of the BCG with an extended, redshifted tail. Based on
the spatial and spectral configurations of the HI, CN and CO gases, it is
inferred that cool gas spirals into the core of the BCG, which is then fed to
the central AGN. Indeed, our KaVA observation reveals a parsec-scale bipolar
jet, implying that this AGN could have been (re)powered quite recently.
Combining this, we suggest that some cold gas in A1644-S could have been formed

magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu$, and the Standard Model prediction
strongly suggests the existence of beyond the Standard Model physics. Following
the Standard Model Effective Field Theory approach, we study a particular
topology, the \emph{bridge} diagram, which gives a chirally enhanced
contribution to $a_\mu$. We classify all possible 2- and 3-field SM extensions
that can generate this contribution and present the full $a_\mu$ result for
them. Within our approach, we find that several 2-field fermion-scalar
extensions which had been previously discarded in the literature -- when only
the Yukawa-suppressed contribution was considered -- can actually be viable
models to explain the observed anomaly. Furthermore, the 3-field extensions
which generate the bridge diagram represent a new class of models to account
for $a_\mu$. We explore a particular 3-field extension which, beyond explaining
$a_\mu$, can also account for the neutral $B$-meson anomalies and the Cabibbo
angle anomaly. We present the full one-loop matching for this model and a
one-loop phenomenological study.

$0.2<z<1.7$ using well-matched observations and multiple state-of-the-art
simulations (e.g., Massive Black II, Horizon-AGN, Illustris, TNG and a
semi-analytic model). The observed sample consists of 646 uniformly-selected
SDSS quasars ($0.2 < z < 0.8$) and 32 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs;
$1.2<z<1.7$) with imaging from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) for the former and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for the latter. We first add realistic
observational uncertainties to the simulation data and then construct a
simulated sample in the same manner as the observations. Over the full redshift
range, our analysis demonstrates that all simulations predict a level of
intrinsic scatter of the scaling relations comparable to the observations which
appear to agree with the dispersion of the local relation. Regarding the mean
relation, Horizon-AGN and TNG are in closest agreement with the observations at
low and high redshift ($z\sim$ 0.2 and 1.5, respectively) while the other
simulations show subtle differences within the uncertainties. For insight into
the physics involved, the scatter of the scaling relation, seen in the SAM, is
reduced by a factor of two and closer to the observations after adopting a new
feedback model that considers the geometry of the AGN outflow. The consistency
in the dispersion with redshift in our analysis supports the importance of both
quasar- and radio-mode feedback prescriptions in the simulations. Finally, we
highlight the importance of increasing the sensitivity (e.g., using the James
Webb Space Telescope), thereby pushing to lower masses and minimizing biases
due to selection effects.

oscillating heavy fields during inflation that can imprint distinctive

Within this universality class, any unitary that can be reached in one metric

Paranal. We validated the new HR42 mode using four hours of on-target
observations of the quasar J0003-2603, known to host an intervening metal-poor
absorber along the line of sight. The capabilities of the ESPRESSO HR42 mode
(resolving power R~137 000) were evaluated by comparing to a UVES spectrum of
the same target with a similar integration time but lower resolving power (R~48
000). For both data sets we tested the ability to decompose the velocity
profile of the intervening absorber using Voigt profile fitting and extracted
the total column densities of CIV, NI, SiII, AlII, FeII, and NiII. With ~3x the
resolving power and ~2x lower S/N for a nearly equivalent exposure time, the
ESPRESSO data is able to just as accurately characterize the individual
components of the absorption lines as the comparison UVES data, but has the
added bonus of identifying narrower components not detected by UVES. For UVES
to provide similar spectral resolution (R>100 000; 0.3'' slit) and the broad
wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO, the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) supplied by
ESO estimates 8 hrs of exposure time spread over two settings; requiring double
the time investment than that of ESPRESSO's HR42 mode whilst not properly
sampling the UVES spectral resolution element. Thus ESPRESSO's HR42 mode offers
nearly triple the resolving power of UVES (0.8'' slit to match typical ambient

associated binding proteins -- is a paradigmatic example of active matter.
Particle transport through the cytoskeleton can range from anomalous and
heterogeneous subdiffusion to superdiffusion and advection. Yet, recapitulating
and understanding these properties -- ubiquitous to the cytoskeleton and other
out-of-equilibrium soft matter systems -- remains challenging. Here, we combine
light sheet microscopy with differential dynamic microscopy and single-particle
tracking to elucidate anomalous and advective transport in
actomyosin-microtubule composites. We show that particles exhibit multi-mode
transport that transitions from pronounced subdiffusion to superdiffusion at
tunable crossover timescales. Surprisingly, while higher actomyosin content
enhances superdiffusivity, it also markedly increases the degree of
subdiffusion at short timescales and generally slows transport. Corresponding
displacement distributions display unique combinations of non-Gaussianity,
asymmetry, and non-zero modes, indicative of directed advection coupled with
caged diffusion and hopping. At larger spatiotemporal scales, particles undergo
superdiffusion which generally increases with actomyosin content, in contrast
to normal, yet faster, diffusion without actomyosin. Our specific results shed
important new light on the interplay between non-equilibrium processes,
crowding and heterogeneity in active cytoskeletal systems. More generally, our
approach is broadly applicable to active matter systems to elucidate transport
and dynamics across scales.

s. Although many space evaluation and pass prediction methods rely on motion
models, the validity of each has not been fully clarified. This study focuses
on the motion model proposed by Fujimura and Sugihara (Fujimura-Sugihara model)

indicated that the Fujimura-Sugihara model is ineffective for soccer games
because it generates a circular arrival region. This study aims to examine the

Specifically, we quantitatively compare the arrival regions of players between
the model and real data. We show that the boundary of the player's arrival
region is circular rather than elliptical, which is consistent with the model.
We also show that the initial speed dependence of the arrival region satisfies
the solution of the model. Furthermore, we propose a method for estimating
valid kinetic parameters in the model directly from tracking data and discuss
the limitations of the model for soccer games based on the estimated

a unified Bayesian CAT bond pricing framework based on uncertainty
quantification of catastrophes and interest rates. Our framework allows for
complex beliefs about catastrophe risks to capture the distinct and common

rates, yields a unified asset pricing approach with informative expected risk

Prior-Hierarchical Bayesian Collective Risk Model (DP-HBCRM) framework -- we
model catastrophe risk via a model-based clustering approach. Interest rate
risk is modeled as a CIR process under the Bayesian approach. As a consequence
of casting CAT pricing models into our framework, we evaluate the price and

enabling the construction of clinically relevant imaging signatures of
neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Oftentimes, such methods don't
explicitly model the heterogeneity of disease effects, or approach it via
nonlinear models that are not interpretable. Moreover, unsupervised methods may
parse heterogeneity that is driven by nuisance confounding factors that affect
brain structure or function, rather than heterogeneity relevant to a pathology
of interest. On the other hand, semi-supervised clustering methods seek to
derive a dichotomous subtype membership, ignoring the truth that disease
heterogeneity spatially and temporally extends along a continuum. To address
the aforementioned limitations, herein, we propose a novel method, termed
Surreal-GAN (Semi-SUpeRvised ReprEsentAtion Learning via GAN). Using
cross-sectional imaging data, Surreal-GAN dissects underlying disease-related
heterogeneity under the principle of semi-supervised clustering (cluster
mappings from normal control to patient), proposes a continuously dimensional
representation, and infers the disease severity of patients at individual level
along each dimension. The model first learns a transformation function from
normal control (CN) domain to the patient (PT) domain with latent variables
controlling transformation directions. An inverse mapping function together
with regularization on function continuity, pattern orthogonality and
monotonicity was also imposed to make sure that the transformation function
captures necessarily meaningful imaging patterns with clinical significance. We
first validated the model through extensive semi-synthetic experiments, and
then demonstrate its potential in capturing biologically plausible imaging
patterns in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

these strategies have proven to be impactful, some values outlined in documents

processes. Such unaddressed values mainly deal with contextual factors that
cannot be easily quantified. In this paper, we develop a value-based assessment
framework that is not limited to bias auditing and that covers prominent
ethical principles for algorithmic systems. Our framework presents a circular
arrangement of values with two bipolar dimensions that make common motivations

principles, values are then broken down into specific criteria and their
manifestations. However, some of these value-specific criteria are mutually
exclusive and require negotiation. As opposed to some other auditing frameworks
that merely rely on ML researchers' and practitioners' input, we argue that it
is necessary to include stakeholders that present diverse standpoints to
systematically negotiate and consolidate value and criteria tensions. To that
end, we map stakeholders with different insight needs, and assign tailored
means for communicating value manifestations to them. We, therefore, contribute
to current ML auditing practices with an assessment framework that visualizes
closeness and tensions between values and we give guidelines on how to
operationalize them, while opening up the evaluation and deliberation process

Jacobian frequency regularization for models' Jacobians to have a larger ratio

show that biasing classifiers towards low (high)-frequency components can bring
performance gain against high (low)-frequency corruption and adversarial

question of Ramis Movassagh, renewed the study of a process proposed in the
early 1980s by Jean Bourgain. A state vector $v \in \mathbb R^n$, labeled with
the vertices of a connected graph, $G$, changes in discrete time steps
following the simple rule that at each step a random edge $(i,j)$ is picked and
$v_i$ and $v_j$ are both replaced by their average $(v_i+v_j)/2$. It is easy to
see that the value associated with each vertex converges to $1/n$. The question
was how quickly will $v$ be $\epsilon$-close to uniform in the $L^{1}$ norm in
the case of the complete graph, $K_{n}$, when $v$ is initialized as a standard
basis vector that takes the value 1 on one coordinate, and zeros everywhere
else. They have established a sharp cutoff of $\frac{1}{2\log 2}n\log n +
O(n\sqrt{\log n})$. Our main result is to prove, that
$\frac{(1-\epsilon)}{2\log2}n\log n-O(n)$ is a general lower bound for all
connected graphs on $n$ nodes. We also get sharp magnitude of $t_{\epsilon,1}$
for several important families of graphs, including star, expander, dumbbell,
and cycle. In order to establish our results we make several observations about
the process, such as the worst case initialization is always a standard basis
vector. Our results add to the body of work of Aldous, Aldous and Lanoue,
Quattropani and Sau, Cao, Olshevsky and Tsitsiklis, and others. The renewed
interest is due to an analogy to a question related to the Google's supremacy

'augmented entropy function' which may find independent interest in the
computer science and probability theory communities.

  of personalized tumor growth modeling",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solving the inverse problem is the key step in evaluating the capacity of a
physical model to describe real phenomena. In medical image computing, it
aligns with the classical theme of image-based model personalization.
Traditionally, a solution to the problem is obtained by performing either
sampling or variational inference based methods. Both approaches aim to
identify a set of free physical model parameters that results in a simulation
best matching an empirical observation. When applied to brain tumor modeling,
one of the instances of image-based model personalization in medical image
computing, the overarching drawback of the methods is the time complexity for
finding such a set. In a clinical setting with limited time between imaging and
diagnosis or even intervention, this time complexity may prove critical. As the
history of quantitative science is the history of compression, we align in this
paper with the historical tendency and propose a method compressing complex
traditional strategies for solving an inverse problem into a simple database
query task. We evaluated different ways of performing the database query task
assessing the trade-off between accuracy and execution time. On the exemplary
task of brain tumor growth modeling, we prove that the proposed method achieves
one order speed-up compared to existing approaches for solving the inverse
problem. The resulting compute time offers critical means for relying on more
complex and, hence, realistic models, for integrating image preprocessing and
inverse modeling even deeper, or for implementing the current model into a
clinical workflow.

systems in the microcanonical ensemble. This theory allows to reformulate
Bachmann's classification of PTs for finite-size systems in terms of geometric
properties of the energy level sets (ELSs) associated to the Hamiltonian
function. Specifically, by defining the microcanonical entropy as the logarithm
of the ELS's volume equipped with a suitable metric tensor, we obtain an exact
equivalence between thermodynamics and geometry. In fact, we show that any
derivative of entropy with respect to the energy variable can be associated to
a specific combination of geometric curvature structures of the ELSs which, in
turn, are precise combinations of the potential function derivatives. In this
way, we establish a direct connection between the microscopic description
provided by the Hamiltonian and the collective behavior which emerges in a PT.
Finally, we also analyze the behavior of the ELSs' geometry in the
thermodynamic limit, showing that non-analyticities of the energy-derivatives
of the entropy are caused by non-analyticities of certain geometric properties
of the ELSs around the transition point. Finally, we validate the theory

correlation between attention-based explanations and existing feature
attribution explanations using LSTM-based models. In our work, we (i) compare
the rank correlation between five more recent feature attribution methods and
two attention-based methods, on two types of NLP tasks, and (ii) extend this
analysis to also include transformer-based models. We find that attention-based
explanations do not correlate strongly with any recent feature attribution
methods, regardless of the model or task. Furthermore, we find that none of the
tested explanations correlate strongly with one another for the
transformer-based model, leading us to question the underlying assumption that
we should measure the validity of attention-based explanations based on how
well they correlate with existing feature attribution explanation methods.
After conducting experiments on five datasets using two different models, we
argue that the community should stop using rank correlation as an evaluation
metric for attention-based explanations. We suggest that researchers and

example of an idealized Atmosphere-Ocean model that rests upon Hasselmann's
paradigm for stochastic climate models. Namely, stochasticity is incorporated
into the fast moving atmospheric component of an idealized coupled model by
means of stochastic Lie transport, while the slow moving ocean model remains
deterministic. More specifically the stochastic model SALT (stochastic
advection by Lie transport) is constructed by introducing stochastic transport
into the material loop in Kelvin's circulation theorem. The resulting
stochastic model preserves circulation, as does the underlying deterministic
climate model. A variant of SALT called LA-SALT (Lagrangian-Averaged SALT) is
introduced in this paper. In LA-SALT, we replace the drift velocity of the
stochastic vector field by its expected value. The remarkable property of
LA-SALT is that the evolution of its higher moments are governed by linear
deterministic equations. Our modelling approach is substantiated by
establishing local existence results, first, for the deterministic climate

Here, we report that Mn-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are an excellent platform
for generating hot electrons via upconversion that can benefit from various
desirable exciton properties and the structural diversity of metal halide
perovskites (MHP). 2-dimensional Mn-doped CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets are
particularly advantageous for hot electron upconversion due to the strong
exciton-dopant interaction mediating the upconversion process. Furthermore,
nanoplatelets reveal evidence for the hot electron upconversion via long-lived
dark exciton in addition to bright exciton that may enhance the upconversion
efficiency. This study not only establishes the feasibility of hot electron
upconversion in MHP host but also demonstrates the potential merits of
2-dimensional MHP nanocrystals in hot electron upconversion.

lower optical depth, Ly$\beta$ offers a potentially more sensitive probe to any
remaining neutral gas compared to commonly used Ly$\alpha$ line. We identify
dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest using spectra of 42 QSOs at $z_{\rm em}>5.5$,
including new data from the XQR-30 VLT Large Programme. Approximately $40\%$ of
these QSO spectra exhibit dark gaps longer than $10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at
$z\simeq5.8$. By comparing the results to predictions from simulations, we find
that the data are broadly consistent both with models where fluctuations in the
Ly$\alpha$ forest are caused solely by ionizing ultraviolet background (UVB)
fluctuations and with models that include large neutral hydrogen patches at
$z<6$ due to a late end to reionization. Of particular interest is a very long
($L=28h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) and dark ($\tau_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 6$) gap persisting
down to $z\simeq 5.5$ in the Ly$\beta$ forest of the $z_{\rm}=5.85$ QSO PSO

average neutral hydrogen fraction of $ \langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle \gtrsim 5\%$

$5.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.0$ based on the observed Ly$\beta$ dark gap length
distribution and a conservative relationship between gap length and neutral
fraction derived from simulations. We find $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle \leq
0.05$, 0.17, and 0.29 at $z\simeq 5.55$, 5.75, and 5.95, respectively. These

considered as a measure only for linear dependence. The use of Pearson's r has
been strongly discouraged in nonlinear scenarios. Recent research shows that
this opinion is myth and Pearson's r should not be ruled out a priori for
measuring nonlinear monotonic relationships. We find that Pearson's r does have
potential to measure nonlinear dependence as long as the relationships are
monotonic, it just underestimates them. We derive a new inequality which is
tighter than the famous Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, leverage it to adjust the
underestimation, and propose a new correlation statistic, i.e., rearrangement
correlation. The rearrangement correlation is able to capture arbitrary
monotonic relationships, both linear and nonlinear ones. It reverts to
Pearson's r in linear scenarios, and to Spearman's rho when calculated on
ranks. Investigations on simulated and real-life scenarios show that the
rearrangement correlation is more accurate in measuring nonlinear monotonic
dependence, and more powerful in testing nonlinear monotonic dependence than
classical correlation statistics, and other recently proposed measures. Thus,
Pearson's r is a gold measure not only for linear dependence, but also for
nonlinear monotonic dependence, if adjusted.

In a junction of ferromagnetic insulators with a large electronic gap, the spin
angular momentum is exchanged during the tunneling process of magnons across
the junction interface. The advanced technology in the field of plasmonics and
metamaterials realizes that spins irradiated by the laser field interact only
with the magnetic component of the laser through the Zeeman coupling. Using an
analytic perturbation theory, we provide a general formula for magnon transport
induced by the inversion symmetry breaking across the junction interface. Then,
we show that those spin currents are enhanced by the ferromagnetic resonance,
and the period of the ac spin current is one-half of that of the laser magnetic

updating rules that lead to robustly better decisions either asymptotically
almost surely or in finite sample with a pre-specified probability. Especially,
they are easy to implement as are given by simple extensions of the standard

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel class of stochastic models that

decline over the radial range of a few times the effective radius, indicating a
significant deficit of dark matter (DM) mass in the galaxy centre. The DM mass
deficit is interpreted as the existence of a DM density core rather than the
cuspy structure predicted by the standard cosmological model. A recent study
proposed that a galaxy merger, in which the smaller satellite galaxy is
significantly compacted by dissipative contraction of the galactic gas, can
heat the centre of the host galaxy and help make a large DM core. By using an
$N$-body simulation, we find that a large amount of DM mass is imported to the
centre by the merging satellite, making this scenario an unlikely solution for
the DM mass deficit. In this work, we consider giant baryonic clumps in high
redshift galaxies as alternative heating source for creating the baryon
dominated galaxies with a DM core. Due to dynamical friction, the orbit of
clumps decays in a few Gyr and the baryons condensate at the galactic centre.
As a back-reaction, the halo centre is heated up and the density cusp is
flattened out. The combination of the baryon condensation and core formation
makes the galaxy baryon dominated in the central 2-5 kpc, comparable to the
effective radius of the observed galaxies. Thus, the dynamical heating by giant
baryonic clumps is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed dearth of DM
in high redshift galaxies.

descent (SGD) with stochastic Polyak stepsize (SPS). The proposed SPS comes
with strong convergence guarantees and competitive performance; however, it has
two main drawbacks when it is used in non-over-parameterized regimes: (i) It
requires a priori knowledge of the optimal mini-batch losses, which are not
available when the interpolation condition is not satisfied (e.g., regularized
objectives), and (ii) it guarantees convergence only to a neighborhood of the
solution. In this work, we study the dynamics and the convergence properties of
SGD equipped with new variants of the stochastic Polyak stepsize and provide
solutions to both drawbacks of the original SPS. We first show that a simple
modification of the original SPS that uses lower bounds instead of the optimal
function values can directly solve issue (i). On the other hand, solving issue
(ii) turns out to be more challenging and leads us to valuable insights into
the method's behavior. We show that if interpolation is not satisfied, the
correlation between SPS and stochastic gradients introduces a bias, which
effectively distorts the expectation of the gradient signal near minimizers,
leading to non-convergence - even if the stepsize is scaled down during
training. To fix this issue, we propose DecSPS, a novel modification of SPS,
which guarantees convergence to the exact minimizer - without a priori
knowledge of the problem parameters. For strongly-convex optimization problems,

neural network compilers determine how to set these values by building a graph
of choices and choosing the path with minimal 'cost'. These choices and their
corresponding costs are usually determined by an algorithm crafted by engineers

these models consistently produce an optimal schedule for all scenarios, whilst

redshifts based upon a source's radio spectrum alone, we have extracted the
radio sources from the Million Quasars Catalogue. Of these, 44,119 have a
spectroscopic redshift, required for model validation, and for which photometry
could be obtained. Using the radio spectral properties as features, we fail to
find a model which can reliably predict the redshifts, although there is the
suggestion that the models improve with the size of the training sample. Using
the near-infrared--optical--ultraviolet bands magnitudes, we obtain reliable
predictions based on the 12,503 radio sources which have all of the required
photometry. From the 80:20 training--validation split, this gives only 2501
validation sources, although training the sample upon our previous SDSS model
gives comparable results for all 12,503 sources. This makes us confident that
SkyMapper, which will survey southern sky in the u, v, g, r, i, z bands, can be
used to predict the redshifts of radio sources detected with the Square
Kilometre Array. By using machine learning to impute the magnitudes missing
from much of the sample, we can predict the redshifts for 32,698 sources, an
increase from 28% to 74% of the sample, at the cost of increasing the outlier
fraction by a factor of 1.4. While the ""optical"" band data prove successful, at

from different reported numbers of superconducting transitions at ambient

insights into the superconducting properties of UTe$_2$, we measured the heat
capacity and electrical resistivity of single crystals under compressive
uniaxial stress $\sigma$ applied along different crystallographic directions.
We find that the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of the single observed bulk
superconducting transition decreases with $\sigma$ along $[100]$ and $[110]$
but increases with $\sigma$ along $[001]$. Aside from its effect on $T_{\rm
c}$, we notice that $c$-axis stress leads to a significant piezoresistivity,
which we associate with the shift of the zero-pressure resistivity peak at
$T^\star \approx 15\, \rm K$ to lower temperatures under stress. Finally, we
show that an in-plane shear stress $\sigma_{xy}$ does not induce any observable
splitting of the superconducting transition over a stress range of
$\sigma_{xy}\approx 0.17 \, \rm GPa$. This result suggests that the

the most frequent type of landing accidents. Identification of factors which
contribute to the occurrence of runway overruns can help mitigate the risk and
prevent such accidents. Methods such as physics-based and statistical-based
models were proposed in the past to estimate runway overrun probabilities.
However, they are either costly or require experts' knowledge. We propose a
statistical approach to quantify the risk probability of an aircraft to exceed
a threshold at the speed of 80 knots given a set of influencing factors. This
copula based D-vine regression approach is used because it allows for complex
tail dependence and is computationally tractable. Data obtained from the Quick
Access Recorder (QAR) for 711 flights are analyzed. We identify 41 flights with
an estimated risk probability > 0.001 for a chosen threshold and rank the
effects of each influencing factor for these flights. Also, the complex
dependency patterns between some influencing factors for the 41 flights are
shown to be non symmetric. The D-vine regression approach, compared to
physics-based and statistical-based approaches, has an analytical solution, is
not simulation based and can be used to estimate very small or large
probabilities efficiently.

often not well understood. In order for a system to be stable, cell renewal,

shape must remain relatively unchanged. Simple epithelial tissues occur in
various structures throughout the body, such as the endothelium, mesothelium,

Despite the prevalence of simple epithelial tissues, there are few models which
accurately describe how these tissues maintain a stable structure.
  Here, we present a novel, 3D, deformable, multilayer, cell-centre model of a
simple epithelium. Cell movement is governed by the minimisation of a bending
potential across the epithelium, cell-cell adhesion, and viscous effects. We
show that the model is capable of maintaining a consistent tissue structure

the conditions under which a giant X-ray burst caused by a BeHMXB exceeds the
Eddington luminosity. Moreover, we investigate the duration for which BeHMXBs
can be observed as transient ULXs with bursts above the Eddington luminosity
during binary evolutions. The results indicate that BeHMXBs could be ULXs for a
typical duration of approximately 1 Myr. Comparisons with nearby observed
BeHMXBs indicate that many binary systems have the potential to become ULXs
during their evolution. Particularly, a BeHMXB system tends to become a ULX
when the Be donor has a dense deccretion disc aligned with the orbital plane.
Because BeHMXBs are very common objects and a significant number of them can
become ULXs, we conclude that a reasonable fraction of the observed ULXs could
consist of evolved BeHMXBs.

metrics to fairly evaluate prediction algorithms. The area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the balanced precision (BP) are the
two most popular metrics in early studies, while their effectiveness is
recently under debate. At the same time, the area under the precision-recall

Based on a toy model with tunable noise and predictability, we propose a method
to measure the discriminating abilities of any given metric. We apply this
method to the above three threshold-free metrics, showing that AUC and AUPR are
remarkably more discriminating than BP, and AUC is slightly more discriminating
than AUPR. The result suggests that it is better to simultaneously use AUC and
AUPR in evaluating link prediction algorithms, at the same time, it warns us
that the evaluation based only on BP may be unauthentic. This article provides
a starting point towards a comprehensive picture about effectiveness of

behavioral scores describing attributes of the trip (e.g, driver fatigue or
driver distraction) so we examine whether it can be used to identify periods of
increased risk by successfully classifying trips that occur immediately before
a trip in which there was an incident leading to a claim for that driver.
Identification of periods of increased risk for a driver is valuable because it
creates an opportunity for intervention and, potentially, avoidance of a claim.
We examine metadata for each trip a driver takes and train a classifier to
predict whether \textit{the following trip} is one in which a claim occurs for
that driver. By achieving a area under the receiver-operator characteristic

Additionally, we compare the predictive power, as measured by the area under

whether a driver will have a claim using exposure features such as driven
miles, and those trained using behavioral features such as a computed speed
score.

including real-time trend prediction and object detection on top of IoT sensing
data. One popular type of stream analytics is the recurrent neural network
(RNN) deep learning model based time series or sequence data prediction and
forecasting. Different from traditional analytics that assumes data are
available ahead of time and will not change, stream analytics deals with data
that are being generated continuously and data trend/distribution could change
(a.k.a. concept drift), which will cause prediction/forecasting accuracy to
drop over time. One other challenge is to find the best resource provisioning
for stream analytics to achieve good overall latency. In this paper, we study
how to best leverage edge and cloud resources to achieve better accuracy and
latency for stream analytics using a type of RNN model called long short-term
memory (LSTM). We propose a novel edge-cloud integrated framework for hybrid
stream analytics that supports low latency inference on the edge and high
capacity training on the cloud. To achieve flexible deployment, we study
different approaches of deploying our hybrid learning framework including
edge-centric, cloud-centric and edge-cloud integrated. Further, our hybrid
learning framework can dynamically combine inference results from an LSTM model
pre-trained based on historical data and another LSTM model re-trained
periodically based on the most recent data. Using real-world and simulated
stream datasets, our experiments show the proposed edge-cloud deployment is the
best among all three deployment types in terms of latency. For accuracy, the
experiments show our dynamic learning approach performs the best among all
learning approaches for all three concept drift scenarios.

  The ring-like structures of the EHTC can be created not only from the public

very sensitive to the FOV size. The u-v coverage of EHT lack about 40
micro-asec fringe spacings. Combining with a very narrow FOV, it created the 40
micro-asec ring structure. We conclude that the absence of the jet and the
presence of the ring in the EHTC result are both artifacts owing to the narrow
FOV setting and the u-v data sampling bias effect of the EHT array. Because the
EHTC's simulations only take into account the reproduction of the input image
models, and not those of the input noise models, their optimal parameters can
enhance the effects of sampling bias and produce artifacts such as the 40
micro-asec ring structure, rather than reproducing the correct image.

that trace out the general direction of the trajectory. KEMP first predicts
keyframes conditioned on the road context, and then fills in intermediate
states conditioned on the keyframes and the road context. Under our general
framework, goal-conditioned methods are special cases in which the number of
keyframes equal to one. Unlike goal-conditioned methods, our keyframe predictor
is learned automatically and does not require hand-crafted goal-selection
algorithms. We evaluate our model on public benchmarks and our model ranked 1st
on Waymo Open Motion Dataset Leaderboard (as of September 1, 2021).

particle, initially in the first level, {\em i}, to survive the transition and
to remain in the first level, depends exponentially on the square of the tunnel
matrix element between the two levels. This result remains valid when the
second level, {\em f}, is broadened due to e.g. coupling to continuum [V. M.
Akulin and W. P. Schleicht, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 46}, 4110 (1992)]. If the level,
{\em i}, is also coupled to continuum, albeit much weaker than the level {\em
f}, a particle, upon surviving the transition, will eventually escape. However,
for shorter times, the probability to find the particle in the level {\em i}
after crossing {\em f} is {\em enhanced} due to the coupling to continuum.
This, as shown in the present paper, is the result of a second-order process,
which is an {\em additional coupling between the levels}. The underlying
mechanism of this additional coupling is virtual tunneling from {\em i} into
continuum followed by tunneling back into {\em f}.

absorbed disk-blackbody plus cutoff power-law, in the hard, intermediate and
soft states. In addition, we detect an $\approx$6.6 keV Fe emission line in the
hard intermediate state. Throughout the soft intermediate and soft states, the
fitted inner disk radius remains almost constant; we suggest that it has
settled at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, in the hard and
hard intermediate states, the apparent inner radius was unphysically small
(smaller than ISCO), even after accounting for the Compton scattering of some
of the disk photons by the corona in the fit. We argue that this is the result
of a high hardening factor, $f_{\rm col}\approx2.0-2.7$, in the early phases of
outburst evolution, well above the canonical value of 1.7 suitable to a steady
disk. We suggest that the inner disk radius was close to ISCO already in the
low/hard state. Furthermore, we propose that this high value of hardening
factor in the relatively hard state is probably caused by the additional
illuminating of the coronal irradiation onto the disk. Additionally, we
estimate the spin parameter with the continuum-fitting method, over a range of
plausible black hole masses and distances. We compare our results with the spin
measured with the reflection-fitting method and find that the inconsistency of
the two results is partly caused by the different choices of $f_{\rm col}$.

Unfortunately, existing estimation methods do not necessarily work as expected
in the new setting, and strategies that can achieve a reasonable goal in such a

robust optimization (DRO), which formalizes an ambiguity about the target
population and adapts to the worst-case scenario in the set. It is shown that
DRO with Wasserstein distance-based characterization of ambiguity provides
simple intuitions and a simple estimation method. I then develop an estimator

An empirical application shows that the proposed approach outperforms the naive

Here we build a toy model to address this issue by considering a population
with bimodal response behaviors, or specifically, with the Fermi and
Tit-for-tat updating rules. While the former rule tends to imitate the
strategies of those neighbors who are doing well, the latter repeats what their
neighbors did to them. In a structural mixing implementation, where the
updating rule is fixed for each individual, we find that a moderate mode
mixture unexpectedly boosts the overall cooperation level of the population.
The boost is even more pronounced in the probabilistic mixing, where each
individual randomly chooses one of the two modes at each step, and full
cooperation is seen in a wide range. These findings are robust to the
underlying topology of the population. Our mean-field treatment reveals that
the cooperation prevalence within the players with the Fermi rule linearly
increases with the fraction of TFT players and explains the non-monotonic
dependence in the structural mixing. Our study shows that the diversity in
response behaviors may help to explain the emergence of cooperation in

performance (e.g., excess risk) of prediction in the target domain.
Specifically, we distinguish two scenarios: the learning problem is called
causal learning if the feature is the cause and the label is the effect, and is
called anti-causal learning otherwise. We show that in causal learning, the
excess risk depends on the size of the source sample at a rate of O(1/m) only
if the labelling distribution between the source and target domains remains
unchanged. In anti-causal learning, we show that the unlabeled data dominate
the performance at a rate of typically O(1/n). Our analysis is based on the
notion of potential outcome random variables and information theory. These
results bring out the relationship between the data sample size and the

Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). These sources are typically ignored because
they are in highly attenuated parts of the MWA primary beam, however in
aggregate these sources have apparent flux densities of $10\,\rm{Jy}$ on
angular scales we expect to detect the $21\,\rm{cm}$ signal. We create bespoke
multi-component 2D Gaussian models for Galactic SNRs and for Centaurus A, and
simulate the visibilities for two MWA snapshot observations. We grid those
visibilities and then Fourier transform them with respect to frequency,
averaging them both spherically and cylindrically to produce the 1D and 2D
power spectra. We compare the simulated 1D power spectra to the expected
$21\,\rm{cm}$ power spectrum. We find that although these extended sources are
in highly attenuated parts of the MWA primary beam pattern, collectively they
have enough power ($\sim10^4-10^5\,\rm{mK^2}\,\it{h^{-3}} \,\rm{Mpc^{3}}$) on
EoR significant modes ($|\mathbf{k}| \leq 0.1 h \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$) to prohibit
detection of the $21\,\rm{cm}$ signal ($10^4\,\rm{mK^2}\,\it{h^{-3}}

reduce leakage to a level of $10-20\%$ of the $21\,\rm{cm}$ power spectrum on
EoR significant modes. The effects of widefield extended sources will have

representations of its solution group. We study the solution groups of graph
incidence games, which are linear system games in which the underlying linear
system is the incidence system of a (non-properly) two-coloured graph. While it
is undecidable to determine whether a general linear system game has a perfect
quantum strategy, for graph incidence games this problem is solved by
Arkhipov's theorem, which states that the graph incidence game of a connected
graph has a perfect quantum strategy if and only if it either has a perfect
classical strategy, or the graph is nonplanar. Arkhipov's criterion can be
rephrased as a forbidden minor condition on connected two-coloured graphs. We
extend Arkhipov's theorem by showing that, for graph incidence games of
connected two-coloured graphs, every quotient closed property of the solution
group has a forbidden minor characterization. We rederive Arkhipov's theorem
from the group theoretic point of view, and then find the forbidden minors for
two new properties: finiteness and abelianness. Our methods are entirely
combinatorial, and finding the forbidden minors for other quotient closed
properties seems to be an interesting combinatorial problem.

  Part I: We investigate the relativistic adaptation of the Lattice Boltzmann
Method reproducing a turbulent, two-dimensional, massless hydrodynamic system

numeric formulation is evaluated and the flow characteristics produced are
compared to properties of classical turbulence. The model can reasonably be

proposed multiple scalar-tensor gravity that dynamically solves the
cosmological constant problem. The L-asymmetry generation in one of two
proposed scenarios is triggered by dynamical relaxation of scalar inflaton
field towards the zero cosmological constant. CPT violation (C= charge
conjugation, P = parity operation, T= time reversal) in the presence of a
chemical potential gives the necessary time arrow, and lepton number violating
scattering in cosmic thermal medium generates a net cosmological L-number via
resonance formation. Another scenario is L-asymmetry generation from
evaporating primordial black holes. These proposed mechanisms do not require CP
violating phases in physics beyond the standard model: the new required physics
is existence of heavy Majorana leptons of masses $ 10^{15} \sim 10^{17}$ GeV

lepto-genesis in two scenarios, which may give the right amount of observed
baryon to entropy ratio. It might even be possible to experimentally determine

hyperplanes in generic position in a $k$ dimensional space (see \cite{MS}).
Differently from the case $k=1$ in which it corresponds to the well known braid
arrangement, the discriminantal arrangement in the case $k>1$ has a
combinatorics which depends from the choice of the original $n$ hyperplanes. It
is known that this combinatorics is constant in an open Zariski set
$\mathcal{Z}$, but to assess wether or not $n$ fixed hyperplanes in generic
position belongs to $\mathcal{Z}$ proved to be a nontrivial problem. Even to
simply provide examples of configurations not in $\mathcal{Z}$ is still a
difficult task. In this paper, moving from a recent result in \cite{SSc}, we
define a $\textit{weak linear independency}$ condition among sets of vectors
which, if imposed, allows to build configurations of hyperplanes not in
$\mathcal{Z}$. We provide $3$ examples.

spotting accelerator with SRAM based in-memory computing (IMC) and on-chip
learning for user customization. However, IMC is constrained by macro size,
limited precision, and non-ideal effects. To address the issues mentioned
above, this paper proposes bias compensation and fine-tuning using an IMC-aware
model design. Furthermore, because learning with low-precision edge devices
results in zero error and gradient values due to quantization, this paper
proposes error scaling and small gradient accumulation to achieve the same
accuracy as ideal model training. The simulation results show that with user
customization, we can recover the accuracy loss from 51.08\% to 89.76\% with
compensation and fine-tuning and further improve to 96.71\% with customization.
The chip implementation can successfully run the model with only 14$uJ$ per

higher energy efficiency with additional on-chip model customization

to learn a distribution that accounts for both the dynamics of the robot and
complex obstacle geometries. We can then sample from this distribution to
produce control sequences which are likely to be both goal-directed and
collision-free as part of our proposed FlowMPPI sampling-based MPC method.
However, when deploying this method, the robot may encounter an
out-of-distribution (OOD) environment, i.e. one which is radically different
from those used in training. In such cases, the learned flow cannot be trusted
to produce low-cost control sequences. To generalize our method to OOD
environments we also present an approach that performs projection on the
representation of the environment as part of the MPC process. This projection
changes the environment representation to be more in-distribution while also
optimizing trajectory quality in the true environment. Our simulation results

  inference",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Acquiring fear responses to predictors of aversive outcomes is crucial for
survival. At the same time, it is important to be able to modify such
associations when they are maladaptive, for instance in treating anxiety and
trauma-related disorders. Standard extinction procedures can reduce fear
temporarily, but with sufficient delay or with reminders of the aversive
experience, fear often returns. The latent-cause inference framework explains
the return of fear by presuming that animals learn a rich model of the
environment, in which the standard extinction procedure triggers the inference
of a new latent cause, preventing the unlearning of the original aversive
associations. This computational framework had previously inspired an
alternative extinction paradigm -- gradual extinction -- which indeed was shown
to be more effective in reducing the return of fear. However, the original
framework was not sufficient to explain the pattern of results seen in the
experiments. Here, we propose a formal model to explain the effectiveness of
gradual extinction in reducing spontaneous recovery and reinstatement effects,
in contrast to the ineffectiveness of standard extinction and a gradual reverse
control procedure. We demonstrate through quantitative simulation that our
model can explain qualitative behavioral differences across different
extinction procedures as seen in the empirical study. We verify the necessity
of several key assumptions added to the latent-cause framework, which suggest
potential general principles of animal learning and provide novel predictions
for future experiments.

cooperating radios to combine coherently at a destination radio. To achieve
coherent combining, the radios can exchange preambles with the destination for
frequency synchronization and signal phase adjustment. At the destination,
coherent combining leads to a beamforming (BF) gain. The BF gain can extend the
communication range by countering the path loss that increases with the
distance from the destination. While ideally the maximum range can be trivially
calculated from the BF gain, in reality, the BF gain depends on the distance
because, at a larger distance, lower SNR of the exchanged preambles causes
higher synchronization and phase estimation errors, which in turn degrades the
BF gain. In this paper, considering the BF gain degradation for a
destination-led BF protocol, we calculate the maximum communication range to
realize a desired post-BF SNR by analyzing the relation between the pre-BF SNR
and the BF gain. We show that increasing the preamble lengths or increasing the
destination power can significantly increase the maximum range while just
increasing the number of radios gives diminishing range extension.

networks from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (T1 MRIs), and the
predicted brain age could serve as an effective biomarker for detecting
aging-related diseases or disorders. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
neural network architecture, referred to as optimal transport based feature
pyramid fusion (OTFPF) network, for the brain age estimation with T1 MRIs. The
OTFPF consists of three types of modules: Optimal Transport based Feature
Pyramid Fusion (OTFPF) module, 3D overlapped ConvNeXt (3D OL-ConvNeXt) module
and fusion module. These modules strengthen the OTFPF network's understanding
of each brain's semi-multimodal and multi-level feature pyramid information,
and significantly improve its estimation performances. Comparing with recent
state-of-the-art models, the proposed OTFPF converges faster and performs
better. The experiments with 11,728 MRIs aged 3-97 years show that OTFPF
network could provide accurate brain age estimation, yielding mean absolute
error (MAE) of 2.097, Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.993 and
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.989, between the estimated
and chronological ages. Widespread quantitative experiments and ablation
experiments demonstrate the superiority and rationality of OTFPF network. The
codes and implement details will be released on GitHub:

study of DNs and detect if a DN is involved in in-browser cryptojacking. Thus,
we are motivated to study different temporal and behavioral aspects of DNs
involved in cryptojacking. We use temporal features such as query frequency and
query burst along with graph-based features such as degree and diameter, and
non-temporal features such as the string-based to detect if a DNs is suspect to
be involved in the in-browser cryptojacking. Then, we use them to train the
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms over different temporal granularities such as
2 hours datasets and complete dataset. Our results show DecisionTrees
classifier performs the best with 59.5% Recall on cryptojacked DN, while for
unsupervised learning, K-Means with K=2 perform the best. Similarity analysis
of the features reveals a minimal divergence between the cryptojacking DNs and
other already known malicious DNs. It also reveals the need for improvements in
the feature set of state-of-the-art methods to improve their accuracy in
detecting in-browser cryptojacking. As added analysis, our signature-based
analysis identifies that none-of-the Indian Government websites were involved
in cryptojacking during October-December 2021. However, based on the resource
utilization, we identify 10 DNs with different properties than others.

augmented samples with their original samples in training corpus. Experiments
on three translation datasets of different scales show that AdMix achieves

trade, when there is a revenue-maximizing seller selling an item to a buyer
with a private value drawn from a prior. Between the seller and the buyer,
there is an intermediary that can segment the market by releasing information
about the true values to the seller. This is termed signaling, and enables the
seller to price discriminate. In this setting, Bergemann et al. showed the
existence of a signaling scheme that simultaneously raises the optimal consumer
surplus, guarantees the item always sells, and ensures the seller's revenue
does not increase.
  Our work extends the positive result of Bergemann et al. to settings where
the type space is larger, and where optimal auction is randomized, possibly
over a menu that can be exponentially large. In particular, we consider two
settings motivated by budgets: The first is when there is a publicly known
budget constraint on the price the seller can charge and the second is the
FedEx problem where the buyer has a private deadline or service level
(equivalently, a private budget that is guaranteed to never bind). For both
settings, we present a novel signaling scheme and its analysis via a continuous
construction process that recreates the optimal consumer surplus guarantee of
Bergemann et al.
  The settings we consider are special cases of the more general problem where
the buyer has a private budget constraint in addition to a private value. We
finally show that our positive results do not extend to this more general
setting. Here, we show that any efficient signaling scheme necessarily
transfers almost all the surplus to the seller instead of the buyer.

various unusual properties as it was tracked on its passage through the inner

spacecraft mission to intercept and study it in situ would be invaluable. As an
extension to previous Project Lyra studies, this paper elaborates an
alternative mission to 1I/'Oumuamua, this time also requiring a Jupiter Oberth
Manoeuvre (JOM) to accelerate the spacecraft towards its destination. The
difference is in the combination of planetary flybys exploited to get to
Jupiter, which includes a Mars encounter before proceeding to Jupiter. The
trajectory identified is inferior to previous finds in terms of higher $\Delta
V$ requirement (15.6 $kms^{-1}$), longer flight duration (29 years) and less
mission preparation time (launch 2026), however it benefits from a feature
absent from previous JOM candidates, in that there is little or no $\Delta V$
en route to Jupiter (i.e. a free ride) which means the spacecraft need not
carry a liquid propellant stage. This is marginally offset by the higher
$\Delta V$ needed at Jupiter, requiring either 2 or 3 staged solid rocket
motors. As an example, a Falcon Heavy Expendable with a CASTOR 30B booster
followed by a STAR 48B can deliver 102kg to 1I/'Oumuamua by the year 2059.
Other scenarios with shorter flight durations and higher payload masses are
possible.

early clinical signs of DR, whose timely diagnosis can help detecting DR in the
early stages of its development. It has been observed that MAs are more common
in the inner retinal layers compared to the outer retinal layers in eyes
suffering from DR. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging
technique that provides a cross-sectional view of the retina and it has been
used in recent years to diagnose many eye diseases. As a result, in this paper
has attempted to identify areas with MA from normal areas of the retina using
OCT images. This work is done using the dataset collected from FA and OCT
images of 20 patients with DR. In this regard, firstly Fluorescein Angiography
(FA) and OCT images were registered. Then the MA and normal areas were
separated and the features of each of these areas were extracted using the Bag
of Features (BOF) approach with Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) descriptor.
Finally, the classification process was performed using a multilayer perceptron
network. For each of the criteria of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and

training RecSys is its high memory capacity requirements, reaching hundreds of
GBs to TBs of model size. In RecSys, the so-called embedding layers account for
the majority of memory usage so current systems employ a hybrid CPU-GPU design
to have the large CPU memory store the memory hungry embedding layers.
Unfortunately, training embeddings involve several memory bandwidth intensive
operations which is at odds with the slow CPU memory, causing performance
overheads. Prior work proposed to cache frequently accessed embeddings inside
GPU memory as means to filter down the embedding layer traffic to CPU memory,
but this paper observes several limitations with such cache design. In this
work, we present a fundamentally different approach in designing embedding
caches for RecSys. Our proposed ScratchPipe architecture utilizes unique
properties of RecSys training to develop an embedding cache that not only sees
the past but also the ""future"" cache accesses. ScratchPipe exploits such
property to guarantee that the active working set of embedding layers can
""always"" be captured inside our proposed cache design, enabling embedding layer
training to be conducted at GPU memory speed.

allows the effective value of the vacuum energy, described as a condensate of a
4-form abelian gauge field strength F=dA, to change in space and time. This is
achieved by the identification of the torsion dependent part of the
Chern-Simons 3-form of the Euler class with the gauge potential A, which enters
the effective action of the conformal anomaly as a J.A interaction analogous to
electromagnetism. The conserved 3-current J describes the worldtube of
2-surfaces that separate regions of differing vacuum energy. The resulting EFT
thus replaces the fixed constant Lambda of classical gravity, and its
apparently unnaturally large sensitivity to UV physics, with a dynamical
condensate whose ground state value in empty flat space is Lambda = 0
identically. By allowing Lambda to vary rapidly near the 2-surface of a black
hole horizon, the proposed EFT of dynamical vacuum energy provides an effective
Lagrangian for gravitational condensate stars, as the final state of complete
gravitational collapse consistent with quantum theory. The possible
consequences of dynamical vacuum dark energy for cosmology, the cosmic
coincidence problem, and the role of conformal invariance for other fine tuning
issues in the SM are discussed.

a weak complexity rank that we introduce; having weak complexity rank at most
one can be thought of as `two-colored local finite-dimensionality'.
  We first show that for separable, unital, and simple $C^*$-algebras, weak
complexity rank one is equivalent to the conjunction of nuclear dimension one
and real rank zero. In particular, this shows that the UCT for all nuclear
$C^*$-algebras is equivalent to equality of the weak complexity rank and the
complexity ranks for Kirchberg algebras with zero $K$-theory groups. However,
we also show using a $K$-theoretic obstruction (torsion in $K_1$) that weak

seen in the X-ray and UV spectra from many active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
widths and centroid energies of these features indicate they occur in
outflowing gas, and the outflow can affect the gas within the host galaxy. Thus
the warm absorber mass and energy budgets are of great interest. Estimates for
these properties depend on models which connect the observed strengths of the
absorption features with the density, composition, and ionization state of the
absorbing gas. Such models assume that the ionization and heating of the gas
come primarily from the strong continuum near the central black hole. They also
assume that the various heating, cooling, ionization, and recombination
processes are in a time-steady balance. This assumption may not be valid, owing
to the intrinsic time-variability of the illuminating continuum, or other
factors which change the cloud environment. This paper presents models for warm
absorbers which follow the time dependence of the ionization, temperature, and

first conduct a detailed characterization on a state-of-the-art, large-scale

explore the feasibility of utilizing capacity-optimized NVM SSDs for storing

use existing passenger trips for logistics services and thus reduce additional
vehicle kilometers for freight delivery and the total number of vehicles on the
road network. This is achieved by merging the need for two separate fleets into
a single one by combining the services. To evaluate the potential of such a
mobility-on-demand service, this paper uses an agent-based simulation framework
and integrates three heuristic parcel assignment strategies into a ride-pooling
fleet control algorithm. Two integration scenarios (moderate and full) are set
up. While in both scenarios passengers and parcels share rides in one vehicle,
in the moderate scenario no stops for parcel pick-up and delivery are allowed
during a passenger ride to decrease customer inconvenience. Using real-world
demand data for a case study of Munich, Germany, the two integration scenarios
together with the three assignment strategies are compared to the status quo,
which uses two separate vehicle fleets for passenger and logistics transport.
The results indicate that the integration of logistics services into a
ride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacities
without deteriorating passenger transport. Depending on the assignment
strategies nearly all parcels can be served until a parcel to passenger demand
ratio of 1:10 while the overall fleet kilometers can be deceased compared to
the status quo.

and combine it with our multi-frame denoising network. At last, we propose a
denoising strategy that processes multiple frames sequentially. Sequential
denoising avoids filtering a large number of frames by decomposing multiple
frames denoising into several efficient sub-network denoising. As for each
sub-network, we propose an efficient multi-frequency denoising network to
remove noise of different frequencies. Our three-stage design is efficient and
shows strong performance on burst denoising. Experiments on synthetic and real
raw datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
with less computational cost. Furthermore, the low complexity and high-quality
performance make deployment on smartphones possible.

natural image and medical image computing tasks. However, these achievements
indispensably rely on accurately annotated training data. If encountering some
noisy-labeled images, the network training procedure would suffer from
difficulties, leading to a sub-optimal classifier. This problem is even more
severe in the medical image analysis field, as the annotation quality of
medical images heavily relies on the expertise and experience of annotators. In
this paper, we propose a novel collaborative training paradigm with global and
local representation learning for robust medical image classification from
noisy-labeled data to combat the lack of high quality annotated medical data.
Specifically, we employ the self-ensemble model with a noisy label filter to
efficiently select the clean and noisy samples. Then, the clean samples are
trained by a collaborative training strategy to eliminate the disturbance from
imperfect labeled samples. Notably, we further design a novel global and local
representation learning scheme to implicitly regularize the networks to utilize
noisy samples in a self-supervised manner. We evaluated our proposed robust
learning strategy on four public medical image classification datasets with
three types of label noise,ie,random noise, computer-generated label noise, and
inter-observer variability noise. Our method outperforms other learning from
noisy label methods and we also conducted extensive experiments to analyze each

candidate for a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory in ten
dimensions. As a most attractive feature, the model admits the emergence of
(3+1)-dimensional space-time associated with the spontaneous breaking of the
(9+1)-dimensional Lorentz symmetry. Numerical confirmation of such a phenomenon
has been attempted for more than two decades. Recently it has been found that
the sign problem, the main obstacle in simulating this model, can be overcome
by the complex Langevin method. It has been shown that the Lorenzian version of
the model is smoothly connected with the Euclidean version, in which the SO(10)
symmetry is found to be spontaneously broken to SO(3). Here we propose to add a
Lorentz invariant ""mass"" term to the original model and discuss a scenario that
(3+1)-dimensional expanding space-time with Lorentzian signature appears at
late times. Some numerical results supporting this scenario are presented.

Interestingly, there is a prominent excitation mode in the Raman $A_2$ channel,
indicating a strong subleading tendency toward a chiral spin liquid phase.

torso simulators (HATS) for binaural audio capture to obtain an accurate
subjective impression and acoustic measure of the soundscape under evaluation.
To auralise the binaural recordings as recorded or at set levels, the audio
stimuli and the headphone setup are usually calibrated with a HATS. However,
calibrated HATS are too financially prohibitive for most research teams,
inevitably diminishing the availability of the soundscape standard. With the
increasing availability of soundscape binaural recording datasets, and the
importance of cross-cultural validation of the soundscape ISO standards, e.g.\
via the Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP), it is imperative to
assess the suitability of cost-effective headphone calibration methods to
maximise availability without severely compromising on accuracy. Hence, this
study objectively examines an open-circuit voltage (OCV) calibration method in
comparison to a calibrated HATS on various soundcard and headphone
combinations. Preliminary experiments found that calibration with the OCV

as an important method for this task, as it substantially reduces the amount of
data required for the identification compared to conventional
frequency-response testing at different excitation/response levels. In the case
of shaker-stinger excitation, the applied excitation force is commonly measured
in order to quantify the amplitude-dependent modal damping ratio from the
phase-resonant test data. In the case of base excitation, however, the applied
excitation force is challenging or impossible to measure. In this work we
develop an original method for damping quantification from phase-resonant
tests. It relies solely on response measurement; it avoids the need to resort
to force measurement. The key idea is to estimate the power provided by the
distributed inertia force imposed by the base motion. We develop both a
model-free and a model-based variant of the method. We validate the developed
method first in virtual experiments of a friction-damped and a geometrically

and shows a highly asymmetric features of a few 100 au scale in the molecular
emission lines. Blue-shifted emission is much stronger in the CS ($J=5$-4) line
than red-shifted one. The asymmetry can be explained if the gas accretion is
episodic and takes the form of cloudlet capture, given the cloudlet approached
toward us. The gravity of the protostar transforms the cloudlet into a stream
and changes its velocity along the flow. The emission from the cloudlet should
be blue-shifted before the periastron, while it should be red-shifted after the
periastron. If a major part of cloudlet has not reached the periastron, the
former should be dominant. We perform hydrodynamical simulations to examine the
validity of the scenario. Our numerical simulations can reproduce the observed
asymmetry if the orbit of the cloudlet is inclined to the disk plane. The
inclination can explain the slow infall velocity observed in the C$^{18}$O
($J$=2-1) line emission. Such episodic accretion may occur in various
protostellar cores since actual clouds could have inhomogeneous density
distribution. We also discuss the implication of the cloudlet capture on
observations of related objects.

local in the canonical sense of quantum field theory. Interestingly, one of the
fields is fermionic and the other bosonic. The mass dimension of the introduced
fermionic fields and the matter fields of the Standard Model carry an intrinsic
mismatch. As such, they provide natural darkness for the new fields with

such he implicitly ignored the remaining fifteen. When we examine the remaining
roots, we obtain additional bosonic and fermionic dark matter candidates of

a coupling scalar field in de Sitter space under the guidance from the
adiabatically regularized Green's function. For the massive scalar field with
the minimal coupling $\xi=0$, the 2nd order point-splitting regularization
yields a finite vacuum stress tensor with a positive, constant energy density,
which can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives de Sitter
inflation. For the coupling $\xi\ne 0$, we find that, even if the regularized
Green's function is continuous, UV and IR convergent, the point-splitting
regularization does not automatically lead to an appropriate stress tensor. The
coupling $\xi R$ causes log divergent terms, as well as higher-order finite
terms which depend upon the path of the coincidence limit. After removing these
unwanted terms by extra treatments, the 2nd-order regularization for small
couplings $\xi \in(0,\frac{1}{7.04})$, and respectively the 0th-order
regularization for the conformal coupling $\xi=\frac16$, yield a finite,
constant vacuum stress tensor, in analogy to the case $\xi=0$. For the massless
field with $\xi=0$ or $\xi=\frac16$, the point-splitting regularization yields
a vanishing vacuum stress tensor, and there is no conformal trace anomaly for
$\xi=\frac16$. If the 4th-order regularization were taken, the regularized
energy density for general $\xi$ would be negative, which is inconsistent with
the de Sitter inflation, and the regularized Green's function would be singular
at the zero mass, which is unphysical. In all these cases, the stress tensor
from the point-splitting regularization is equal to that from the adiabatic
one.

  dynamical-learning graph convolution mechanism","21 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Short-term traffic flow prediction is a vital branch of the Intelligent
Traffic System (ITS) and plays an important role in traffic management. Graph
convolution network (GCN) is widely used in traffic prediction models to better
deal with the graphical structure data of road networks. However, the influence
weights among different road sections are usually distinct in real life, and
hard to be manually analyzed. Traditional GCN mechanism, relying on
manually-set adjacency matrix, is unable to dynamically learn such spatial
pattern during the training. To deal with this drawback, this paper proposes a
novel location graph convolutional network (Location-GCN). Location-GCN solves
this problem by adding a new learnable matrix into the GCN mechanism, using the
absolute value of this matrix to represent the distinct influence levels among
different nodes. Then, long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed in the
proposed traffic prediction model. Moreover, Trigonometric function encoding is
used in this study to enable the short-term input sequence to convey the
long-term periodical information. Ultimately, the proposed model is compared
with the baseline models and evaluated on two real word traffic flow datasets.
The results show our model is more accurate and robust on both datasets than
other representative traffic prediction models.

there are no methods determining reliability for MCL estimate. This paper
presents a novel localization framework that enables robust localization,
reliability estimation, and quick re-localization, simultaneously. The
presented method can be implemented using similar estimation manner to that of
MCL. The method can increase localization robustness to environment changes by
estimating known and unknown obstacles while performing localization; however,
localization failure of course occurs by unanticipated errors. The method also
includes a reliability estimation function that enables us to know whether
localization has failed. Additionally, the method can seamlessly integrate a
global localization method via importance sampling. Consequently, quick
re-localization from failures can be realized while mitigating noisy influence
of global localization. Through three types of experiments, we show that
reliable MCL that performs robust localization, self-failure detection, and
quick failure recovery can be realized.

domains is a fundamental yet crucial ability of the human visual system. While
recent self-supervised learning methods have achieved good performances with
evaluation set on the same domain as the training set, they will have an
undesirable performance decrease when tested on a different domain. Therefore,
the self-supervised learning from multiple domains task is proposed to learn
domain-invariant features that are not only suitable for evaluation on the same
domain as the training set but also can be generalized to unseen domains. In
this paper, we propose a Domain-invariant Masked AutoEncoder (DiMAE) for
self-supervised learning from multi-domains, which designs a new pretext task,
\emph{i.e.,} the cross-domain reconstruction task, to learn domain-invariant
features. The core idea is to augment the input image with style noise from
different domains and then reconstruct the image from the embedding of the
augmented image, regularizing the encoder to learn domain-invariant features.
To accomplish the idea, DiMAE contains two critical designs, 1)
content-preserved style mix, which adds style information from other domains to
input while persevering the content in a parameter-free manner, and 2) multiple
domain-specific decoders, which recovers the corresponding domain style of
input to the encoded domain-invariant features for reconstruction. Experiments
on PACS and DomainNet illustrate that DiMAE achieves considerable gains
compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.

alter the control-flow of embedded devices to gain access to sensitive

attacks, manufacturers deploy hardware-based fault defenses into
security-critical systems, such as secure elements. The development of these
countermeasures is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of circuit
components and because contemporary design automation tools tend to optimize
inserted structures away, thereby defeating their purpose. Hence, it is
critical that such countermeasures are rigorously verified post-synthesis. As
classical functional verification techniques fall short of assessing the
effectiveness of countermeasures, developers have to resort to methods capable
of injecting faults in a simulation testbench or into a physical chip. However,
developing test sequences to inject faults in simulation is an error-prone task
and performing fault attacks on a chip requires specialized equipment and is
incredibly time-consuming. To that end, this paper introduces SYNFI, a formal

for scalable quantum technologies. Recently, quantum light emitters have been
discovered in the wide-gap van der Waals insulator hBN. These color centers
have attracted considerable attention due to their quantum performance at
elevated temperatures and wide range of transition energies. Here, we
demonstrate coherent state manipulation of a single hBN color center with
ultrafast laser pulses and investigate in our joint experiment-theory study the
coupling between the electronic system and phonons. We demonstrate that
coherent control can not only be performed resonantly on the optical transition
giving access to the decoherence but also phonon-assisted, which reveals the
internal phonon quantum dynamics. In the case of optical phonons we measure
their decoherence, stemming in part from their anharmonic decay. Dephasing
induced by the creation of acoustic phonons manifests as a rapid decrease of
the coherent control signal when traveling phonon wave packets are emitted.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quantum superposition between a
phonon-assisted process and the resonant excitation causes ultrafast
oscillations of the coherent control signal. Our results pave the way for
ultrafast phonon quantum state control on the nanoscale and open up a new
promising perspective for hybrid quantum technologies.

in living organisms. Various rearrangements like reversals, transpositions,
translocations, fissions, fusions, and combinations and different variations
have been studied extensively by computational biologists and computer
scientists over the past four decades. From a mathematical point of view, a
genome is represented by a permutation. The genome rearrangement problem is
interpreted as a problem that transforms one permutation into another in a
minimum number of moves under certain constraints depending on the chosen
rearrangements. Finding the minimum number of moves is equivalent to sorting
the permutation with the given rearrangement. A transposition is an operation
on a permutation that moves a sublist of a permutation to a different position
in the same permutation. A \emph{Prefix Transposition}, as the name suggests,
is a transposition that moves a sublist which is a prefix of the permutation.
  In this thesis, we study prefix transpositions on permutations and present a
better upper bound for sorting permutations with prefix transpositions. A
greedy algorithm called the \emph{generalised sequence length algorithm} is
defined as an extension of the sequence length algorithm where suitable
alternate moves are also considered. This algorithm is used to sequentially
improve the upper bound to $n-\log_{3.3} n$ and $n-\log_3 n$. In the latter
part of the thesis, we defined the concept of a \emph{block}. We used it along
with the greedy moves of the generalised sequence length algorithm to get an
upper bound of $n-\log_2 n$ to sort permutations by prefix transpositions.

exhibits a variety of biases. Decision-makers often aim to take decisions based
on some ground-truth target that is assumed or expected to be unbiased, i.e.,
equally distributed across socially salient groups. In many practical settings,
the ground-truth cannot be directly observed, and instead, we have to rely on a
biased proxy measure of the ground-truth, i.e., biased labels, in the data. In
addition, data is often selectively labeled, i.e., even the biased labels are
only observed for a small fraction of the data that received a positive
decision. To overcome label and selection biases, recent work proposes to learn
stochastic, exploring decision policies via i) online training of new policies
at each time-step and ii) enforcing fairness as a constraint on performance.
However, the existing approach uses only labeled data, disregarding a large
amount of unlabeled data, and thereby suffers from high instability and
variance in the learned decision policies at different times. In this paper, we
propose a novel method based on a variational autoencoder for practical fair

both labeled and unlabeled data and uses the representations to learn a policy
in an online process. Using synthetic data, we empirically validate that our
method converges to the optimal (fair) policy according to the ground-truth

approach not only offers a more stable learning process but also yields
policies with higher fairness as well as utility than previous approaches.

Recent efforts have focused on utilising data-driven methods such as Gaussian
processes and neural networks to overcome these challenges, as they are capable
of capturing these dynamics without requiring extensive knowledge beforehand.
While Gaussian processes have shown to be an effective method for learning
robotic dynamics with the ability to also represent the uncertainty in the
learned model through its variance, they come at a cost of cubic time
complexity rather than linear, as is the case for deep neural networks. In this
work, we leverage the use of deep kernel models, which combine the
computational efficiency of deep learning with the non-parametric flexibility
of kernel methods (Gaussian processes), with the overarching goal of realising
an accurate probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification. Through
using the predicted variance, we adapt the feedback gains as more accurate
models are learned, leading to low-gain control without compromising tracking
accuracy. Using simulated and real data recorded from a seven degree-of-freedom
robotic manipulator, we illustrate how using stochastic variational inference
with deep kernel models increases compliance in the computed torque controller,
and retains tracking accuracy. We empirically show how our model outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods with prediction uncertainty for online inverse

promotes high-quality landmark-preserving maps, and show how it can be solved
via a variant of the recently proposed ZoomOut method that we extend to our
setting. Our method is descriptor-free, efficient and robust to significant
mesh variability. We evaluate our approach on a range of benchmark datasets and
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on non-isometric benchmarks and near
state-of-the-art performance on isometric ones.

from nuclear matter to quark matter in compact stars. The properties of nuclear
matter are fixed by expanding its binding energy to the order of $\rho^3$,
while those of quark matter are predicted by an equivparticle model. The
Maxwell construction is then applied for the quark-hadron mixed phase. By
confronting compact star structures with pulsar observations, we obtain several
EOSs that are compatible with the latest observations while supporting quark
cores inside the most massive stars. It is found that the quark core is rather
small and does not emerge for compact stars with $M\lesssim 2M_\odot$. The
in-medium quark condensate of the stellar matter in those stars are then
extracted within the framework of an equivparticle model, which decreases
nonlinearly with density. At larger densities with pure quark matter, the quark
condensate is still large and does not necessary decrease with density,
indicating significant nonperturbative contributions within the density regions
covered by compact stars.

target sources for space-based interferometers (such as LISA, TianQin). The
observation of their emitted gravitational waves will offer stringent tests on
general theory of relativity, and provide a wealth of information about the
dense environment in galactic centers. To unlock such potential, it is
necessary to correctly characterize EMRI signals. However, resonances are a
phenomena that occurs in EMRI systems and can impact parameter inference, and
therefore the science outcome, if not properly modeled. Here, we explore how to
model resonances and develop an efficient implementation. Our previous work has
demonstrated that tidal resonances induced by the tidal field of a nearby
astrophysical object alters the orbital evolution, leading to a significant
dephasing across observable parameter space. Here, we extensively explore a
more generic model for the tidal perturber with additional resonance
combinations, to study the dependence of resonance strength on the intrinsic
orbital and tidal parameters. To analyze the resonant signals, accurate
templates that correctly incorporate the effects of the tidal field are
required. The evolution through resonances is obtained using a step function,
whose amplitude is calculated using an analytic interpolation of the resonance
jumps. We benchmark this procedure by comparing our approximate method to a
numerical evolution. We find that there is no significant error caused by this
simplified prescription, as far as the astronomically reasonable range in the
parameter space is concerned. Further, we use Fisher matrices to study both the
measurement precision of parameters and the systematic bias due to inaccurate
modeling. Modeling of self-force resonances can also be carried out using the
implementation presented in this study, which will be crucial for EMRI waveform
modeling.

for the deployment of autonomous vehicles in heterogeneous traffic. One of the
most complex outstanding challenges is that of partial occlusion where a target
object is only partially available to the sensor due to obstruction by another
foreground object. A number of leading pedestrian detection benchmarks provide
annotation for partial occlusion, however each benchmark varies greatly in
their definition of the occurrence and severity of occlusion. Recent research
demonstrates that a high degree of subjectivity is used to classify occlusion
level in these cases and occlusion is typically categorized into 2 to 3 broad
categories such as partially and heavily occluded. This can lead to inaccurate
or inconsistent reporting of pedestrian detection model performance depending
on which benchmark is used. This research introduces a novel, objective
benchmark for partially occluded pedestrian detection to facilitate the
objective characterization of pedestrian detection models. Characterization is
carried out on seven popular pedestrian detection models for a range of
occlusion levels from 0-99%. Results demonstrate that pedestrian detection
performance degrades, and the number of false negative detections increase as
pedestrian occlusion level increases. Of the seven popular pedestrian detection
routines characterized, CenterNet has the greatest overall performance,
followed by SSDlite. RetinaNet has the lowest overall detection performance
across the range of occlusion levels.

groundbreaking paradigm that can open new opportunities for the next generation
of efficient analogue and digital computing systems. Decision-making processes
for switching and routing of signal is fundamental for computing as it enables
the transfer of information from one to many (or single) blocks within a
system. Here, we propose and demonstrate a technique for the design of
pulse-based switching devices for the computing of fundamental decision-making
processes. In our technique, we encode information from multiple channels as
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) pulses of varying amplitudes and polarities
propagating through interconnected parallel plate waveguides modelled as simple
transmission lines. An in-depth description of our technique is presented
showing how switching and routing of information can be engineered by correctly
exploiting the linear splitting and superposition of multiple pulses traveling
through waveguide junctions. To demonstrate the potential of our technique for
computing, we develop two devices: a comparator which can calculate the largest
value between two real-valued numbers and a pulse director which exploits the
reciprocity of waveguide junctions to create a similar yet different
performance of a traditional AND gate (emulating its performance via our
analogue linear system). These findings may open new pathways and possibilities
for high-speed electromagnetic pulse-based computing systems.

atmospheres on the polarization of scattered stellar radiation. We considered a
selection of 25 cloud condensates that are expected to be present in extrasolar
planetary atmospheres. Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code POLARIS and assuming Mie scattering theory, we calculated and
studied the net polarization of scattered radiation as a function of planetary
phase angle at optical to near-infrared wavelengths. In addition to the
well-known characteristics in the state of polarization, such as the rainbow
determined by the real part of the refractive index, the behavior of the
underlying imaginary part of the refractive index causes an increase or
decrease in the degree of polarization and a change of sign in the polarization
at a characteristic wavelength. In contrast to Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgFeSiO$_4$,
clouds composed of SiO, MnS, Na$_2$S, or ZnS produce a rapidly decreasing
degree of polarization with increasing wavelength in the context of an
exoplanetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the sign of the polarization changes at a
wavelength of about 0.5 $\mu$m to 0.6 $\mu$m, depending on the specific cloud
condensate. The resulting net polarization is mainly positive for cloud
compositions with large imaginary parts of the refractive index, such as Fe,
FeS, and FeO. In addition, for Fe and FeS clouds, the maximum degree of
polarization at long wavelengths is shifted to larger phase angles than for
FeO. We found that most of these cloud condensates are distinguishable from
each other due to their unique wavelength-dependent complex refractive index.
In particular, an increase or decrease of the net polarization as a function of
wavelength and a change of sign in the polarization at specific wavelengths are
important features for characterizing cloud compositions in exoplanetary
atmospheres.

many real applications, such as financial fraud detection and cyber security.
This task is challenging due to both the complex interactions between the
anomalous nodes with other counterparts and their inconsistency in terms of
attributes. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework that
jointly optimizes a multi-view contrastive learning-based module and an
attribute reconstruction-based module to more accurately detect anomalies on
attributed networks. Specifically, two contrastive learning views are firstly
established, which allow the model to better encode rich local and global
information related to the abnormality. Motivated by the attribute consistency
principle between neighboring nodes, a masked autoencoder-based reconstruction
module is also introduced to identify the nodes which have large reconstruction
errors, then are regarded as anomalies. Finally, the two complementary modules
are integrated for more accurately detecting the anomalous nodes. Extensive
experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets show our model outperforms
current state-of-the-art models.

This paper introduces the probabilistic dynamic logic pDL, a specification
logic for programs in the probabilistic guarded command language (pGCL) of

properties and probabilistic reachability properties, addressing both the
non-deterministic and probabilistic choice operators of pGCL. In order to
precisely explain the meaning of specifications, we formally define the
satisfaction relation for pDL. Since pDL embeds pGCL programs in its
box-modality operator, pDL satisfiability builds on a formal MDP semantics for
pGCL programs. The satisfaction relation is modeled after PCTL, but extended
from propositional to first-order setting of dynamic logic, and also embedding
program fragments. We study basic properties of pDL, such as weakening and
distribution, that can support reasoning systems. Finally, we demonstrate the
use of pDL to reason about program behavior.

three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). An astrospheric interaction
of a stellar wind (SW) with its surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) can only
generate a bow shock if the speed of the interstellar inflow is higher than the
fast magnetosonic speed. Aims. The differences of astrospheres at differing
speeds of the ISM inflow are investigated, and the necessity of the third
dimension in modelling is evaluated. Methods. The model astrosphere of the
runaway O-star $\lambda$ Cephei is computed in both two- and three-dimensional
MHD at four different ISM inflow speeds, one of which is barely faster
(superfast) and one of which is slower (subfast) than the fast magnetosonic
speed. Results. The two-dimensional (2D) and 3D models of astrospheres with ISM
inflow speeds considerably higher than the fast magnetosonic speed are in good
agreement. However, in 2D models, where no realistic SW magnetic field can be
modelled, the downwind structures of the astrospheres vacillate. Models where
hydrodynamic effects are not clearly dominant over the magnetic field show
asymmetries, thus necessitating a 3D approach. The physical times of
simulations of astrospheres with slow ISM inflows can swiftly exceed the
lifetime of the corresponding star. A hitherto unobserved structure has been
found downwind of the astrotail in the subfast 3D model.

avoiding dynamic typing in object-list based implementations or using

However, it is currently facing problems with reliability. In particular, a

To address this problem, tractogram filtering methods have been developed to
remove faulty connections in a postprocessing step. This study takes a closer
look at one such method, \textit{Spherical-deconvolution Informed Filtering of
Tractograms} (SIFT), which uses a global optimization approach to improve the
agreement between the remaining streamlines after filtering and the underlying

plausibility of individual streamlines since its results depend on the size and
composition of the surrounding tractogram. To tackle this problem, we propose
applying SIFT to randomly selected tractogram subsets in order to retrieve
multiple assessments for each streamline. This approach makes it possible to
identify streamlines with very consistent filtering results, which were used as
pseudo ground truths for training classifiers. The trained classifier is able
to distinguish the obtained groups of plausible and implausible streamlines
with accuracy above 80%. The software code used in the paper and pretrained

planning, but largely ignored in generalized planning. Generalized planning
(GP) is usually addressed as a combinatorial search in a given space of
algorithmic solutions, where candidate solutions are evaluated w.r.t.~the
instances they solve. This type of solution evaluation ignores any sub-goal
information that is not explicit in the representation of the planning
instances, causing plateaus in the space of candidate generalized plans.
Furthermore, node expansion in GP is a run-time bottleneck since it requires
evaluating every child node over the entire batch of classical planning
instances in a GP problem. In this paper we define a landmark counting
heuristic for GP (that considers sub-goal information that is not explicitly
represented in the planning instances), and a novel heuristic search algorithm
for GP (that we call PGP) and that progressively processes subsets of the
planning instances of a GP problem. Our two orthogonal contributions are
analyzed in an ablation study, showing that both improve the state-of-the-art
in GP as heuristic search, and that both benefit from each other when used in

the chemical potential of the electrons in an atom or a molecule. The origin of
this notion has been the identification of the Lagrange multiplier $\mu =
\partial E/\partial N$ in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation for the
ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first
discuss why the Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and
therefore cannot be a physical characteristic of an atom or molecule. The
switching of the energy derivative (""chemical potential"") from $-I$ to $-A$
when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or
derivative discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical
noninteger electron systems and the corresponding energy and derivative
$\partial E/\partial N$ are chosen in a specific discontinuous way. The
question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical
potential can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as
atoms and molecules. The conclusion is that such systems lack important
characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford the definition of a
chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open
systems of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a
particles bath or other members of a Gibbsian ensemble). Thermodynamical
(statistical mechanical) concepts like chemical potential, open systems, grand
canonical ensemble etc. are not applicable to a few electron system like an
atom or molecule. A number of topics in DFT are critically reviewed in the
light of these findings: jumps in the Kohn-Sham potential when crossing an
integer number of electrons, the band gap problem, the
deviation-from-straight-lines error, the role of ensembles in DFT.

In this regime, these theories admit effective long-distance descriptions as
Abelian $U(1)^{N-1}$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3$, and semiclassics can be
reliably employed to study non-perturbative phenomena such as colour
confinement and the generation of mass gaps in an analytical setting. At the

free photons with identical gauge couplings $g^2_3 \equiv g^2/L$. Vacuum
polarisation effects, from integrating out heavy charged fields, lift this
degeneracy to give $\floor{\frac{N}{2}}$ distinct values:
$g^2(\frac{2}{L})\lesssim g_{3,\ell}^2 L \lesssim g^2(\frac{2\pi}{NL}) $. In

insurmountable for classical computers. However, today's quantum computers
still have limited demonstrable functionality, and it is expected that scaling
up to millions of qubits is required for them to live up to this touted
promise. The feasible route in achieving practical quantum advantage goals is
to implement a hybrid operational mode that realizes the cohesion of quantum
and classical computers. Here we present a hybrid quantum cloud based on a
memory-centric and heterogeneous multiprocessing architecture, integrated into
a high-performance computing data center grade environment. We demonstrate that
utilizing the quantum cloud, our hybrid quantum algorithms including Quantum
Encoding (QuEnc), Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks and Tensor Networks enable
advantages in optimization, machine learning, and simulation fields. We show
the advantage of hybrid algorithms compared to standard classical algorithms in
both the computational speed and quality of the solution. The achieved advance
in hybrid quantum hardware and software makes quantum computing useful in
practice today.

The uncertainties encountered by USVs, including external disturbances and

capture with constant models. GP is a powerful learning-based tool that can be
integrated with a model-based planning and control framework, which employs a

in terms of the static regret metric, which compares the cumulative loss of an
online policy to that of an optimal benchmark in hindsight. In the definition
of static regret, the action of the benchmark policy remains fixed throughout
the time horizon. Naturally, the resulting regret bounds become loose in
non-stationary settings where fixed actions often suffer from poor performance.
In this paper, we investigate a stronger notion of regret minimization in the
context of online caching. In particular, we allow the action of the benchmark
at any round to be decided by a finite state machine containing any number of
states. Popular caching policies, such as LRU and FIFO, belong to this class.
Using ideas from the universal prediction literature in information theory, we
propose an efficient online caching policy with a sub-linear regret bound. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-dependent regret bound known
for the caching problem in the universal setting. We establish this result by
combining a recently-proposed online caching policy with an incremental parsing
algorithm, namely Lempel-Ziv '78. Our methods also yield a simpler
learning-theoretic proof of the improved regret bound as opposed to the
involved problem-specific combinatorial arguments used in the earlier works.

in terms of creation/annihilation operators acting in the space of
inhomogeneous differential forms on C^n. We refer to such inhomogeneous
differential forms as polyforms. The construction proceeds by choosing a
complex structure J on R^(2n). Spinors are then polyforms on one of the two
totally-isotropic subspaces C^n that arise as eigenspaces of J. There is a
similar description in the split signature case Cl(n,n), with differential
forms now being those on R^n. In this case the model is constructed by choosing
a paracomplex structure I on R^(n,n), and spinors are polyforms on one of the
totally null eigenspaces R^n of I. The main purpose of the paper is to describe
the geometry of an analogous construction in the case of a general Clifford
algebra Cl(r,s), r+s=2m. We show that in general a creation/annihilation
operator model is in correspondence with a new type of geometric structure on
R^(r,s), which provides a splitting R^(r,s)=R^(2k,2l) plus R^(n,n) and endows
the first factor with a complex structure and the second factor with a
paracomplex structure. We refer to such geometric structure as a mixed
structure. It can be described as a complex linear combination K=I+i J of a
paracomplex and a complex structure such that K^2=Id and K K^* is a product
structure. In turn, the mixed structure is in correspondence with a pair of
pure spinors whose null subspaces are the eigenspaces of K. The conclusion is
then that there is in general not one, but several possible
creation/annihilation operator models for a given Clifford algebra. The number
of models is the number of different types of pure spinors (distinguished by
the real index, see the main text) that exists in a given signature. To
illustrate this geometry, we explicitly describe all the arising models for
Cl(r,s) with r >= s, r+s = 2m <= 6.

programs with the capability of expressing preferential disjunctions in the
heads of program rules. The initial semantics of LPODs, although simple and
quite intuitive, is not purely model-theoretic. A consequence of this is that
certain properties of programs appear non-trivial to formalize in purely
logical terms. An example of this state of affairs is the characterization of
the notion of strong equivalence for LPODs. Although the results of Faber et
al. (2008) are accurately developed, they fall short of characterizing strong
equivalence of LPODs as logical equivalence in some specific logic. This comes
in sharp contrast with the well-known characterization of strong equivalence
for classical logic programs, which, as proved by Lifschitz et al. (2001),
coincides with logical equivalence in the logic of here-and-there. In this
paper we obtain a purely logical characterization of strong equivalence of
LPODs as logical equivalence in a four-valued logic. Moreover, we provide a new
proof of the coNP-completeness of strong equivalence for LPODs, which has an
interest in its own right since it relies on the special structure of such
programs. Our results are based on the recent logical semantics of LPODs
introduced by Charalambidis et al. (2021), a fact which we believe indicates
that this new semantics may prove to be a useful tool in the further study of
LPODs.

  improvements and small corrections",,,,"math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Abridged abstract: In this article we develop formal category theory within
augmented virtual double categories. Notably we formalise the notions of Kan
extension and Yoneda embedding $y_A \colon A \to \hat A$. The latter includes a
formal notion of presheaf object $\hat A$ which recovers, for instance, the
classical notions of enriched category of enriched presheaves, enriched
category of small enriched presheaves, and power object in a finitely complete
category, as well as the notion of Vietoris space of downsets of a
closed-ordered closure space. The Yoneda embeddings of the Yoneda structure
associated to a 2-topos, as constructed by Weber, are instances of our formal
notion too.
  We generalise to monoidal augmented virtual double categories $\mathcal K$
the following fact for finitely complete categories $\mathcal E$ with subobject
classifier $\Omega$: $\mathcal E$ has power objects if and only if $\Omega$ is
exponentiable. More precisely, given a Yoneda embedding $y_I \colon I \to \hat
I$ for the monoidal unit $I$ of $\mathcal K$ and given any `unital' object $A$
in $\mathcal K$, we prove that $y_A \colon A \to \hat A$ exists if and only if
the inner hom $[A^\circ, \hat I]$ does, with $A^\circ$ the `horizontal dual' of
$A$, and in that case $\hat A \cong [A^\circ, \hat I]$.
  We end by formalising the classical notions of exact square, total category
and `small' cocompletion; the latter in an appropriate sense. Throughout we
compare our formalisations to their corresponding 2-categorical counterparts.
Our approach has several advantages. For example the structure of augmented
virtual double categories naturally allows us to isolate conditions that ensure
small cocompleteness of formal presheaf objects $\hat A$.

Kepler and TESS stars with confirmed planets or planet candidates with measured

rotators is almost indistinguishable from that for close-in planets orbiting
slow rotators.

functions for Bayesian optimization (BO) and has demonstrated good empirical
performances in many applications for the minimization of simple regret.
However, under the evaluation metric of cumulative regret, the performance of
EI may not be competitive, and its existing theoretical regret upper bound
still has room for improvement. To adapt the EI for better performance under
cumulative regret, we introduce a novel quantity called the evaluation cost
which is compared against the acquisition function, and with this, develop the
expected improvement-cost (EIC) algorithm. In each iteration of EIC, a new
point with the largest acquisition function value is sampled, only if that
value exceeds its evaluation cost. If none meets this criteria, the current
best point is resampled. This evaluation cost quantifies the potential downside
of sampling a point, which is important under the cumulative regret metric as
the objective function value in every iteration affects the performance
measure. We further establish in theory a tight regret upper bound of EIC for
the squared-exponential covariance kernel under mild regularity conditions, and
perform experiments to illustrate the improvement of EIC over several popular
BO algorithms.

This indicates a primary role of the SP density of states to stabilize CDW. The

aroused increasing attention since uncontaminated images are of vital

ignoring the large gap between the color mappings for the shadow region and the
non-shadow region, leading to poor quality of reconstructed images and a heavy
computation burden. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel
plug-and-play Shadow-Aware Dynamic Convolution (SADC) module to decouple the
interdependence between the shadow region and the non-shadow region. Inspired
by the fact that the color mapping of the non-shadow region is easier to learn,
our SADC processes the non-shadow region with a lightweight convolution module
in a computationally cheap manner and recovers the shadow region with a more
complicated convolution module to ensure the quality of image reconstruction.
Given that the non-shadow region often contains more background color
information, we further develop a novel intra-convolution distillation loss to
strengthen the information flow from the non-shadow region to the shadow

semantics of the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ with general TBoxes by using
categorical language. In this setting, $\mathcal{ALC}$ concepts are represented
as objects, concept subsumptions as arrows, and memberships as logical
quantifiers over objects and arrows of categories. Such a category-based
semantics provides a more modular representation of the semantics of
$\mathcal{ALC}$. This feature allows us to define a sublogic of $\mathcal{ALC}$
by dropping the interaction between existential and universal restrictions,
which would be responsible for an exponential complexity in space. Such a
sublogic is undefinable in the usual set-theoretical semantics, We show that
this sublogic is {\sc{PSPACE}} by proposing a deterministic algorithm for
checking concept satisfiability which runs in polynomial space.

coupled scalar sectors are evaluated using the loop approximation up to second

Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg-Coleman theorem, can take place through a second-order

must have a finite mass gap for all coupling values, such that conformality is
never attained, in opposition to what happens in the simpler ${\mathbb{Z}_2}$

two different fields alters the transition pattern in a significant way. These
results may be relevant to describe the quantum phase transitions taking place
in cold linear systems with competing order parameters. At the same time the
super-renormalizable model proposed here can turn out to be useful as a

maintenance in one programming language or across multiple languages. The
existing work on source clone detection performs well but in a single
programming language. However, if a piece of code with the same functionality
is written in different programming languages, detecting it is harder as
different programming languages have a different lexical structure. Moreover,
most existing work rely on manual feature engineering. In this paper, we
propose a deep neural network model based on source code AST embeddings to
detect cross-language clones in an end-to-end fashion of the source code
without the need of the manual process to pinpoint similar features across
different programming languages. To overcome data shortage and reduce
overfitting, a Siamese architecture is employed. The design methodology of our
model is twofold -- (a) it accepts AST embeddings as input for two different
programming languages, and (b) it uses a deep neural network to learn abstract
features from these embeddings to improve the accuracy of cross-language clone
detection. The early evaluation of the model observes an average precision,
recall and F-measure score of $0.99$, $0.59$ and $0.80$ respectively, which
indicates that our model outperforms all available models in cross-language
clone detection.

phase transition at Tc = 210 K. We present the results of 29Si and 23Na NMR
measurements of NaTiSi2O6. The use of magic angle spinning techniques
unambiguously shows that only one dynamically averaged silicon site can be seen
at T > Tc. At cooling, the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum shows interesting changes.
Immediately below Tc the spectrum gets very broad. Cooling further, it shows
two broad lines of unequal intensities which become narrower as the temperature
decreases. Below 70 K two narrow lines have chemical shifts that are typical
for diamagnetic silicates. The hyperfine field values for the two sites are 7.4
kOe/kB and 4.9 kOe/kB. In the paramagnetic state at high temperature, the
spin-lattice relaxation of 29Si was found to be weakly temperature dependent.
Below Tc the Arrhenius type temperature dependence of the relaxation rate
indicates an energy gap D/kB = 1000(50) K. In the temperature region from 120
to 300 K the relaxation rate was strongly frequency dependent. At room
temperature we found a power law dependence on Larmor frequency of -0.65(5).
For 70 < T < 120 K the relaxation appeared to be non-exponential which we
assigned to a relaxation due to fixed paramagnetic centers. Simulation of the
magnetization recovery curve showed a temperature dependence of the
concentration of these centers proportional to the magnetic susceptibility. The
NMR spectrum of 23Na shows the line with typical shape for the central
transition of a quadrupolar nucleus. A small frequency shift of 23Na resonance
corresponds to a very small hyperfine field of 0.32 kOe/kB . In addition, at T
> Tc the 23Na spectrum shows another Lorentzian shaped resonance which we
attribute to the Na sites where the quadrupolar coupling is partly averaged out
by ionic motion.

single circularly polarized wave underlies one of the most robust and simplest
techniques in atomic magnetometry. This effect causes a narrow
(subnatural-width) resonance in the light wave intensity transmitted through a
vapor cell. Usually, GSHE-based sensors operate in the
spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) regime. However, this regime requires a
relatively high temperature of vapors (150 C or higher), leading to a
relatively large heat release and power consumption of the sensor head.
Besides, without applying special measures, SERF regime significantly limits a
dynamic range of measurements. Here, we study a pump-probe scheme involving a
single elliptically polarized wave and a polarimetric detection technique. The
wave is in resonance with two adjacent optical transitions in the cesium D1
line (894.6 nm) owing to their overlapping in presence of a buffer gas (Ne, 130
Torr). Using a small (0.1 cm$^3$) glass vapor cell, we demonstrate a
possibility of observing subnatural-width resonances with a high
contrast-to-width ratio (up to 45 %/mG) under a low-temperature (60 C) regime
of operation thanks to a strong light-induced circular dichroism. Basing on a
$\Lambda$ scheme of atomic energy levels, we obtain explicit analytical
expressions for the line shape. The model reveals a linewidth narrowing effect
due to openness of the scheme. This result is unusual for magneto-optical
atomic spectroscopy because the openness is commonly considered as a
undesirable effect, degrading the resonance characteristics. We estimate a
sensitivity of 1.8 pT/$\surd$Hz with a 60 fT/$\surd$Hz sensitivity in the
photon-shot-noise limit. The results contribute to the theory of GSHE
resonances and can be applied to development of a low-temperature
high-sensitivity miniaturized magnetic field sensor with an extended dynamic
range.

privacy leakage as a random variable which, in turn, allows us to regard
privacy guarantees as requirements imposed on different statistical properties

significant energy consumption and introduces inherently supplementary latency.
Therefore, our offloading scheme aims to balance the fundamental trade-offs

between energy consumption and latency while meeting the respective needs of
the present traffic. Our findings prove the importance of the cooperation
between the multi-satellite network and the terrestrial network conditioned by

impulsive behavior and are not adequate to be modeled as the Gaussian
distribution. The generalized Gaussian distribution instead is an effective
model to describe real-world systems with impulsive noises. In this paper, the
problem of efficiently evaluating the error performance of linear block codes
over an additive white generalized Gaussian noise (AWGGN) channel is
considered. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is a widely used but inefficient
performance evaluation method, especially in the low error probability regime.
As a variance-reduction technique, importance sampling (IS) can significantly
reduce the sample size needed for reliable estimation based on a well-designed
IS distribution. By deriving the optimal IS distribution on the one-dimensional
space mapped from the observation space, we present a general framework to
designing IS estimators for memoryless continuous channels. Specifically, for
the AWGGN channel, we propose an $L_p$-norm-based minimum-variance IS
estimator. As an efficiency measure, the asymptotic IS gain of the proposed
estimator is derived in a multiple integral form as the signal-to-noise ratio
tends to infinity. Specifically, for the Laplace and Gaussian noises, the gains
can be derived in a one-dimensional integral form, which makes the numerical
calculation affordable. In addition, by limiting the use of the union bound to
an optimized $L_1$-norm sphere, we derive the sphere bound for the additive
white Laplace noise channel. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the
derived IS gain in predicting the efficiency of the proposed IS estimator.

estimation extremely challenging. Previous works based on uni-field assumptions
cannot capture the hybrid far- and near-field features, thus suffering
significant performance loss. This motivates us to consider hybrid-field
channel estimation. We draw inspirations from fixed point theory to develop an
efficient deep learning based channel estimator with adaptive complexity and
linear convergence guarantee. Built upon classic orthogonal approximate message
passing, we transform each iteration into a contractive mapping, comprising a
closed-form linear estimator and a neural network based non-linear estimator. A
major algorithmic innovation involves applying fixed point iteration to compute
the channel estimate while modeling neural networks with arbitrary depth and
adapting to the hybrid-field channel conditions. Simulation results verify our
theoretical analysis and show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art approaches in the estimation accuracy and convergence rate.

statistical methods for summarizing and explaining the variability in

estimate the number of factors or components and then perform FA and PCA
analyses using the point estimate. Therefore, in practice the users ignore any
uncertainty in the point estimate of the number of factors or components. For
datasets where the uncertainty in the point estimate is not ignorable, it is
prudent to perform FA and PCA analyses for the range of positive integer values
in the confidence intervals for the number of factors or components. We address
this problem by proposing a subsampling-based data-intensive approach for
estimating confidence intervals for the number of components in FA and PCA. We
study the coverage probability of the proposed confidence intervals and provide
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees concerning the accuracy of the confidence

transport are efficient in the reconnection and flare looptop regions. However,
there lacks a comprehensive model for explaining and interpreting the
multi-faceted observations. In this work, we model the electron acceleration
and transport in the early impulsive phase of this flare. We solve the Parker
transport equation that includes the primary acceleration mechanism during
magnetic reconnection in the large-scale flare region modeled by MHD
simulations. We find that electrons are accelerated up to several MeV and fill
a large volume of the reconnection region, similar to the observations shown in
microwaves. The electron spatial distribution and spectral shape in the looptop
region agree well with those derived from the microwave and hard X-ray
emissions before magnetic islands grow large and dominate the acceleration.
Future emission modelings using the electron maps will enable direct comparison
with microwave and hard X-ray observations. These results shed new light on the
electron acceleration and transport in a broad region of solar flares within a

  Navier-Stokes Model",,,,,"math.AP physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce a new modified Navier-Stokes model in $3$ dimensions by
modifying the convection term in the ordinary Navier-Stokes equations. This is
done by replacing the convective term $(\textbf{u}\cdot \nabla) \textbf{u}$ by
$(\textbf{v}\cdot \nabla)\textbf{u}$ with
$\textbf{v}=c\textbf{u}/\sqrt{c^2+|\textbf{u}|^2}$ where $c$ is the speed of
light. Thus we have that $|\textbf{v}|\leq c$ and for $|\textbf{u}|\ll c$ we
have $\textbf{v} \approx \textbf{u}$. Thus the solutions to this system should
yield a good approximation to the solutions of the ordinary Navier-Stokes
equations under physically reasonable conditions. The modification of the
convective term is a natural progression of the work done in \cite{JaraczLee}.
The property that $|\textbf{v}|\leq c$ embodies the notion that in relativity
matter can't travel faster than the speed of light, giving the model its name.
We prove that there exists a strong solution $\textbf{u} \in L^2(0, T;
\textbf{H}^2) \cap L^{\infty}(0, T; \textbf{V})$ with $\textbf{u}' \in L^2(0,
T; \textbf{L}^2)$ to our system of equations on either a smooth bounded domain
$U\subset \textbf{R}^3$ or the flat $3$-torus $\mathbb{T}$ for any initial
velocity $\textbf{u}_0 \in \textbf{V}$ and any forcing function $\textbf{f}\in
L^2(0, T; \textbf{L}^2)$. No assumption on the smallness of the data is
necessary. Here $\textbf{V}$ is the space of weakly divergence free vector
fields with components in $H^1$ which vanish on the boundary. We also prove the
uniqueness of this strong solution. Though our modification is somewhat ad-hoc,
it suggests that though more complicated, equations incorporating aspects of
special and general relativity might have better existence and uniqueness
properties than the ordinary Navier-Stokes equations.

clustering data, but despite its importance, no dynamic algorithms for HAC with
good theoretical guarantees exist. In this paper, we study dynamic HAC on
edge-weighted graphs. As single-linkage HAC reduces to computing a minimum
spanning forest (MSF), our first result is a parallel batch-dynamic algorithm
for maintaining MSFs. On a batch of $k$ edge insertions or deletions, our
batch-dynamic MSF algorithm runs in $O(k\log^6 n)$ expected amortized work and
$O(\log^4 n)$ span with high probability. It is the first fully dynamic MSF
algorithm handling batches of edge updates with polylogarithmic work per update
and polylogarithmic span. Using our MSF algorithm, we obtain a parallel
batch-dynamic algorithm that can answer queries about single-linkage graph HAC
clusters.
  Our second result is that dynamic graph HAC is significantly harder for other
common linkage functions. For example, assuming the strong exponential time
hypothesis, dynamic graph HAC requires $\Omega(n^{1-o(1)})$ work per update or
query on a graph with $n$ vertices for complete linkage, weighted average
linkage, and average linkage. For complete linkage and weighted average
linkage, the bound still holds even for incremental or decremental algorithms

correlation, implying that the BH temperature can be rewritten as a function of
shadow radius in the regular spacetime. By analyzing the phase transition
curves under the shadow context, we found that the shadow radius can replace
the event horizon radius to present the BH phase transition process, and the
phase transition grade can also be revealed by the shadow radius, indicating
that the shadow radius may serve as a probe for the phase structure in the
regular spacetime. Utilizing the temperature-shadow radius function, the
thermal profile of the Bardeen-AdS BH is established. We obtained that the

against experimental data for thin Pb films grown on Si(111). Improved
agreement between theory and experiment at short times (<0.3ps) due to
non-thermal electron contributions is found. Moreover, the rate equations allow
for widely different coupling strength to different phonon subsystems.
Consequently, an indirect, electron-mediated energy transfer between strongly
and weakly coupled groups of phonons can be observed in the simulations that
leads to a retarded equilibration of the subsystems only after several
picoseconds.

fulfillment, there are growing concerns around citizen privacy. Drones are
equipped with cameras, and the video feed from these cameras is often required
as part of routine navigation, be it for semi autonomous or fully-autonomous
drones. Footage of ground-based citizens may be captured in this video feed,
thereby leading to privacy concerns.
  This paper presents Privadome, a system that implements the vision of a
virtual privacy dome centered around the citizen. Privadome is designed to be
integrated with city-scale regulatory authorities that oversee delivery drone
operations and realizes this vision through two components, PD-MPC and PD-ROS.
PD-MPC allows citizens equipped with a mobile device to identify drones that
have captured their footage. It uses secure two-party computation to achieve
this goal without compromising the privacy of the citizen's location.
  PD-ROS allows the citizen to communicate with such drones and obtain an audit
trail showing how the drone uses their footage and determine if
privacy-preserving steps are taken to sanitize the footage. An experimental
evaluation of Privadome using our prototype implementations of PD-MPC and
PD-ROS shows that the system scales to near-term city-scale delivery drone
deployments (hundreds of drones). We show that with PD-MPC the mobile data
usage on the citizen's mobile device is comparable to that of routine
activities on the device, such as streaming videos. We also show that the
workflow of PD-ROS consumes a modest amount of additional CPU resources and
power on our experimental platform.

$\omega^{-1/2}$. We now continue this study by investigating a systematic
series of polyalcohols (PAs), frequently used as model systems in
glass-science, i.a., because the width of their respective dielectric loss
spectra varies strongly along the series. Our results reveal that the
microscopic origin of the observed relaxation behavior varies significantly
between different PAs: While short-chained PAs like glycerol rotate as more or
less rigid entities and their light scattering spectra follow the generic
shape, long-chained PAs like sorbitol display pronounced intramolecular dynamic
contributions on the time scale of structural relaxation, leading to systematic
deviations from the generic shape. Based on these findings we discuss an
important limitation for observing the generic shape in a supercooled liquid:
The dynamics that is probed needs to reflect the intermolecular dynamic
heterogeneity, and must not be superimposed by effects of intramolecular
dynamic heterogeneity.

further low latitude clouds available in the literature. Analyzing the
polarimetric data of 17 clouds, we find that the alignment between the envelope
magnetic field ($\theta_{B}^{env}$) and Galactic plane ($\theta_{GP}$) of the
low-latitude clouds varies with their galactic longitudes ($l$). We observe a
strong correlation between the longitude (\textit{l}) and the offset
($\theta_{off}=|\theta_B^{env}-\theta_{GP}|$) which shows that
$\theta_{B}^{env}$ is parallel to the Galactic plane (GP) when the clouds are
situated in the region, $115^\circ<l<250^\circ$. However, $\theta_{B}^{env}$
has its own local deflection irrespective of the orientation of $\theta_{GP}$
when the clouds are at $l<100^\circ$ and $l>250^\circ$. To check the
consistency of our results, the stellar polarization data available at Heiles

polarization vector of field stars. The results are almost consistent with the

play an important role in causing the misalignment phenomenon observed between

jams can both be described as formats where participants engage in designing
and developing prototypes during an intentionally short time frame, such as 48
hours, which is meant to facilitate creativity, and encourage fast decision
making and rapid prototyping. Game jams and hackathons are organised in many
different contexts and for many different purposes as well, such as: internally
in companies to spark new ideas; for fostering citizen innovation for
municipalities; in cultural and governmental agencies; integral parts of
education; entry points for developers wanting to enter especially the game
industry (Olesen, 2020; Kultima, 2015). During the recent decade, game jams and
hackathons have been introduced to academia as well, as formats for teaching
and learning, and as research platforms as well. Only few research
contributions engage with understanding how accelerated design processes in
game jams and hackathons unfold, or how the organisation of game jam and
hackathon formats influence these accelerated design processes.
  The main contributions of my PhD project are: 1) Descriptive process-level
knowledge, which contextualise and solidify how accelerated design processes
unfold under the circumstances of a game jam and a hackathon. 2) Overviews of
how game jams have been organised for supporting participants' creativity and
of how hackathons have been used as means and as research focus within
academia. 3) Exploring how game jam and hackathon formats may be organised in
order to support knowledge generation such as within academia, and in order to
support creativity.

communication and/or remote powering. Propagation through biological media is
very lossy, and previous work has shown that these losses can be separated into
three parts: the losses incurred by the propagating fields, the reflections at
media interfaces, and the coupling of the reactive near field and the lossy
body. The first two are unavoidable, but a clever antenna design can minimize
the near-field losses. A good physical understanding of this particular loss
phenomenon is thus very desirable. Unfortunately, previous work does not take
the implantation depth into account and is thus valid only for deep implants.
In this contribution, we propose approximate expressions to the near field
losses of antennas implanted in biological hosts considering the encapsulation
size, the frequency, the characteristics of the host medium, and the
implantation depth. They are obtained using a spherical wave expansion, and are
useful for realistic implantation scenarios. This is demonstrated by first
comparing the results obtained using these expressions with rigorous
computations for two canonical phantoms: a spherical phantom and a planar
phantom. Finally, the usefulness of the obtained expressions is illustrated in
the practical realization of a capsule-shaped implanted antenna.

physics) paving the way for improving the precision of the inferred stellar

study in which we present a novel approach aimed at selecting from a sample of
acceptable stellar models returned from Forward Modelling techniques, down to
the ones that better represent the core of each star. This is accomplished by
comparing specific properties of the observed frequency ratios for each star to
the ones derived from the acceptable stellar models. We demonstrate that in
this way we are able to constrain further the hydrogen mass fraction in the
core, establishing the stars' precise evolutionary states and ages. The ranges
of the derived core hydrogen mass fractions are [0.01 - 0.06] and [0.12 - 0.19]
for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively, and, considering that the stars are coeval,
the age and metal mass fraction parameters span the region [6.4 - 7.4] Gyr and
[0.023 - 0.026], respectively. In addition, our findings show that using a
single helium-to-heavy element enrichment ratio, ($\Delta Y/\Delta Z$), when
forward modelling the 16 Cyg binary system, may result in a sample of
acceptable models that do not simultaneously fit the observed frequency ratios,
further highlighting that such an approach to the definition of the helium

Here, we adopt a geometrical viewpoint to define a multi-scale centrality in

of a node by its tendency to be close to geodesics between nodes in its
neighborhood, via the concept of triangle inequality excess. Depending on the
size of the neighborhood, the resulting Gromov centrality defines the
importance of a node at different scales in the graph, and recovers as limits

to color editing or object translation and rotation. In this paper, we propose
a method that allows users to perform controllable shape deformation on the

the edited scene without re-training the network. Specifically, we establish a
correspondence between the extracted explicit mesh representation and the
implicit neural representation of the target scene. Users can first utilize
well-developed mesh-based deformation methods to deform the mesh representation
of the scene. Our method then utilizes user edits from the mesh representation
to bend the camera rays by introducing a tetrahedra mesh as a proxy, obtaining
the rendering results of the edited scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework can achieve ideal editing results not only on synthetic

mechanisms for ameliorating hazard impacts of extreme weather events. Research
is scarce regarding latent network characteristics shaping community formation
in human mobility networks during natural disasters. We examined human mobility
networks in Harris County, Texas, in the context of the managed power outage
forced by Winter Storm Uri to detect communities and to evaluate latent
characteristics in those communities. We examined three characteristics in the
communities formed within human mobility networks: hazard-exposure heterophily,
socio-demographic homophily, and social connectedness strength. The analysis
results show that population movements were shaped by socio-demographic
homophily, heterophilic hazard exposure, and social connectedness strength. The
results also indicate that a community encompassing more high-impact areas
would motivate population movements to areas with weaker social connectedness.
Hence, the findings reveal important characteristics shaping community
formation in human mobility networks in hazard response. Specific to managed
power outages, formed communities are spatially co-located, underscoring a best
management practice to avoid prolonged power outages among areas within
communities, thus improving hazard-exposure heterophily. The findings have
implications for power utility operators to account for the characteristics of
socio-spatial human networks when determining the patterns of managed power
outages.

the campaign and a blackbody component with temperature decreasing from ~1.5
keV at the outburst peak to ~0.45 keV in the following months. We found that
the luminosity decay is well described by the sum of two exponential functions,
reflecting the fast decay (~1 d) at the early stage of the outburst followed by
a slower decrease (~30 d). The source reached quiescence about ~80 days after

that productivity is an effective factor for estimating the software effort

of the thin films shows that the c/a ratio (tetragonality) is suppressed to

common issues with existing spatial encodings and propose a simple yet highly

sparse 3D keypoints. This approach is robust to the sparsity of viewpoints and
cross-dataset domain gap. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for

achieve performance comparable to prior work that uses a parametric human body

virtual model respectively, were conducted on a statistical sample of 20
students within the range of 20 to 25 years of age. Within the mentioned
sample, the first group of 10 students were taught safety measures in a
traditional classroom. The second group of 10 students participated in a

distributed after two weeks. Furthermore, two self-reporting tests of
Depression, anxiety, stress test (DASS), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were
assigned to the second group to evaluate the effect of foresight under two

review some general physical and mathematical aspects of 3-dimensional gravity,
focusing on its topological nature. Afterwards, we review some important
aspects of the Ponzano-Regge spin foam model for 3-dimensional Riemannian
quantum gravity and explain in some details how it is related to the
discretized path integral of general relativity in its first-order formulation.
Furthermore, we discuss briefly some related spin foam models and review the
notion of spin network states in order to properly define transition amplitudes
of these models.
  The main results of this thesis are contained in the second part. We start by
reviewing the Boulatov group field theory and explain how it is related to the
Ponzano-Regge model and some advantages of introducing colouring. Afterwards,
we give a very detailed review of the topology of coloured graphs with
non-empty boundary and review techniques, which are devolved in crystallization
theory, a branch of geometric topology. In the last part of this chapter, we
apply these techniques in order to define suitable boundary observables and
transition amplitudes of this model and in order to set up a formalism for
dealing with transition amplitudes in the coloured Boulatov model in a more
systematic way by writing them as topological expansions. We also apply these
techniques to the simplest possible boundary state representing a 2-sphere.
  Last but not least, we review some results regarding quasi-local holography
in the Ponzano-Regge model, construct some explicit examples of coloured graphs
representing manifolds with torus boundary and discuss the transition amplitude
of some fixed boundary graph representing a 2-torus.

introduced to facilitate the understanding of environments. Moreover,
considering the characteristics of vessels, a novel standard view recognition

based on hour-of-week adjusted linear regression on moving averages of energy
consumption. These two methods are compared against state-of-the-art artificial
neural networks. Energy demand predictor algorithms have various computational
costs and prediction quality. While prediction quality is a widely used measure
of predictor superiority, computational costs are less frequently analyzed and
their impact is not so extensively studied. When predictor algorithms are
constantly updated using new data, some computationally expensive forecasting
methods may become inapplicable. The computational costs can be split into
training and execution parts. The execution part is the cost paid when the
already trained algorithm is applied to predict something. In this paper, we
evaluate the above methods with respect to the quality and computational costs,

both epistemic and ethical fronts. On the epistemic side, we argue that many of
the arguments in favor of unification in the natural sciences fail to transfer
over to the machine learning case, or transfer over only under assumptions that
might not hold. Unification also introduces epistemic risks related to
portability, path dependency, methodological diversity, and increased
black-boxing. On the ethical side, we discuss risks emerging from epistemic
concerns, further marginalizing underrepresented perspectives, the
centralization of power, and having fewer models across more domains of
application

human. The key prerequisite for this task is that the AI understands - at any
moment in time - the personal situational context that the human is in. We
outline the key challenges that this task brings forth, namely (i) handling the
human-like and ego-centric nature of the the user's context, necessary for
understanding and providing useful suggestions, (ii) performing lifelong
context recognition using machine learning in a way that is robust to change,
and (iii) maintaining alignment between the AI's and human's representations of
the world through continual bidirectional interaction. In this short paper, we
summarize our recent attempts at tackling these challenges, discuss the lessons
learned, and highlight directions of future research. The main take-away
message is that pursuing this project requires research which lies at the
intersection of knowledge representation and machine learning. Neither
technology can achieve this goal without the other.

and extract characterization parameters, we use smooth planar metal-like
emitter (SPME) methodology and a data-analysis plot. Three types exist:
Millikan-Lauritsen (ML), Fowler-Nordheim (FN) and Murphy-Good (MG) plots. In
SPME methodology, ML and FN plots are slightly curved but a MG plot is nearly
straight. 1956 MG FE theory is better physics than 1928 FN theory, so we expect
MG plots to be more precise than ML or FN plots. Current-voltage data are often
converted: measured voltage to (apparent) macroscopic field, current to
macroscopic current density. Thus, four different data-input forms exist.
Over-simplified models of system behaviour are widely assumed. Whether simple
use of a data-analysis plot is a valid interpretation method is often
neglected. Published FE studies seem to contain a high incidence of spurious
values for ""field enhancement factor"". A procedure (the ""Orthodoxy Test"")
described in 2013 allows a validity check: around 40 % of a small sample of
results were spuriously high. To assist data interpretation and validity
checks, a simple user-friendly webtool has been designed by the lead author. As
inputs, this needs system specification data and ""range-limits"" data from any
of the three plot forms, using any of the four data-input forms. The webtool
then applies the Orthodoxy Test, and -- if passed -- extracts characterization
parameters. This study reports: (1) systematic tests of webtool functionality,
using simulated input data prepared using Extended MG FE theory; and (2)
systematic comparisons of the three different data-plot types, to check how
well extracted parameter values match simulation input values. A summary review
of relevant theory is given. For formal emission areas, the MG plot performs
better than FN and ML plots. This is important for FE science.

The tracer
builds upon the Subgrid Particle Averaged Reynolds Stress Equivalent (SPARSE)
formulation first introduced in [Davis et al., Proceedings of the Royal Society
A, 473(2199), 2017] for the tracing of particle clouds. It was later extended
to a Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) formulation in [Taverniers et al., Journal of
Computational Physics, 390, 2019] using a Gaussian distribution of a cloud's
influence over a mesh-based, velocity field solution. SPARSE corrects the
cloud's trace to second order by combining a Taylor series expansion of the
drag coefficient and Nusselt number correction factors around the mean relative
velocity of a cloud of particles with a Reynolds decomposition of the particle
equations to obtain a governing system for the first two statistical moments of
the cloud's position, velocity and temperature. Here, we close the thus far
unclosed SPARSE formulation by determining the velocity field in the vicinity
of the mean cloud location using a truncated Taylor series velocity
representation and by combining that with averaging. The resulting tracer is
predictive. It enables the tracing of a cloud of particles through a single
point and so reduces the required degrees of freedom in the accurate tracing of
groups of particles. We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the method
in several one-, two- and three-dimensional test cases.

the work done, W, in driving a system from state A to state B, characterized by
the Helmholtz free energies FA and FB, satisfies an equality in which an
average over an ensemble of measurements for W determines the difference in
Free energy. Several features of this result require more detailed description,
to be given in the text. The equality is significant and unexpected. So is the
statement that the equality is independent of the rate of change from state A
to state B. A few years ago, I had presented three papers in which the
contraction of the description from full phase space to coordinate space only
was made. This was motivated by the large difference in time scales for momenta
relaxation and coordinate relaxation. The Jarzynski equality (JE) will be shown
here to be correct only in the limit of slow processes. The proposed example is
for a macromolecular harmonic oscillator with a Hooke's spring constant, k,
that during the time interval linearly changes from k1 to k2. When performed
slowly, we obtain JE in a form in which the free energy is related to the ratio
of the k's. However, when the transition is performed more rapidly the equality
is lost. Jarzynski has suggested to me that Hummer and Szabo have shown that JE
follows directly from the Feynman-Kac formula. We show here that F-K does not
reproduce the direct calculation executed in this paper and that it has been
misapplied in earlier papers.

  on human information sharing behavior",,,"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3189774",,"cs.CY cs.HC cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as
an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater
sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human
sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of
effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of
self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior
in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in
the form of a randomized control trial with a 2x2 factorial design involving
132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human
information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in
exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens,
individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides
investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared
information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information,
such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding
quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to
confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic
motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the
findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect
between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are
critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical
considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those
investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on
human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective
personalized incentives for sharing economies.

Despite the success, existing works fail to take human behaviors as reference

hand, inspired by the ""divide-and-conquer"" reading behaviors of humans, we
present a partitioning-based graph neural network model PGNN on the upgraded
AST of codes. On the other hand, to characterize human behaviors of resorting
to other resources to help code comprehension, we transform raw codes with
external knowledge and apply pre-training techniques for information
extraction. Finally, we combine the two embeddings generated from the two
components to output code embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments to show
the superior performance of PGNN-EK on the code summarization and code clone
detection tasks. In particular, to show the generalization ability of our
model, we release a new dataset that is more challenging for code clone
detection and could advance the development of the community. Our codes and
