  quantitative MRI parameter estimation","20 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning (DL) is gaining popularity as a parameter estimation method for
quantitative MRI. A range of competing implementations have been proposed,
relying on either supervised or self-supervised learning. Self-supervised
approaches, sometimes referred to as unsupervised, have been loosely based on
auto-encoders, whereas supervised methods have, to date, been trained on
groundtruth labels. These two learning paradigms have been shown to have
distinct strengths. Notably, self-supervised approaches have offered lower-bias
parameter estimates than their supervised alternatives. This result is
counterintuitive - incorporating prior knowledge with supervised labels should,
in theory, lead to improved accuracy. In this work, we show that this apparent
limitation of supervised approaches stems from the naive choice of groundtruth
training labels. By training on labels which are deliberately not groundtruth,
we show that the low-bias parameter estimation previously associated with
self-supervised methods can be replicated - and improved on - within a
supervised learning framework. This approach sets the stage for a single,
unifying, deep learning parameter estimation framework, based on supervised
learning, where trade-offs between bias and variance are made by careful
adjustment of training label.

  Learning and Decision Making (RLDM2022)",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the action generalization ability of deep Q-learning in discrete
action spaces. Generalization is crucial for efficient reinforcement learning
(RL) because it allows agents to use knowledge learned from past experiences on
new tasks. But while function approximation provides deep RL agents with a
natural way to generalize over state inputs, the same generalization mechanism
does not apply to discrete action outputs. And yet, surprisingly, our
experiments indicate that Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which use exactly this type of
function approximator, are still able to achieve modest action generalization.
Our main contribution is twofold: first, we propose a method of evaluating
action generalization using expert knowledge of action similarity, and
empirically confirm that action generalization leads to faster learning;
second, we characterize the action-generalization gap (the difference in
learning performance between DQN and the expert) in different domains. We find
that DQN can indeed generalize over actions in several simple domains, but that
its ability to do so decreases as the action space grows larger.

RXCJ1230.7+3439, at z=0.332, using 93 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies
acquired at the 3.6m TNG telescope and from SDSS DR16 public data. We find that
RXCJ1230 appears as a clearly isolated peak in the redshift space, with a
global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $1004_{-122}^{+147}$ km s$^{-1}$,
and showing a very complex structure with the presence of three subclusters.
Our analyses confirm that the three substructures detected are in a pre-merger
phase, where the main interaction takes place with the south-west subclump. We
compute a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\textrm{v} \sim 1000$ and
$\sigma_\textrm{v} \sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$ for the main cluster and the
south-west substructure, respectively. The central main body and south-west
substructure differ by $\sim 870$ km s$^{-1}$ in the LOS velocity. From these
data, we estimate a dynamical mass of $M_{200}= 9.0 \pm 1.5 \times 10^{14}$
M$_{\odot}$ and $4.4 \pm 3.3 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the RXCJ1230 main
body and south-west clump, respectively, which reveals that the cluster will
suffer a merging characterized by a 2:1 mass ratio impact. We solve a two-body
problem for this interaction and find that the most likely solution suggests
that the merging axis lies almost contained in the plane of the sky and the
subcluster will fully interact in $\sim0.3$ Gyr. The comparison between the
dynamical masses and those derived from X-ray data reveals a good agreement
within errors (differences $\sim 15$\%), which suggests that the innermost
regions ($<r_{500}$) of the galaxy clumps are almost in hydrostatical
equilibrium. To summarize, RXCJ1230 is a young but also massive cluster in a
pre-merging phase accreeting other galaxy systems from its environment.

leaves on a compact manifold $M$ with an adapted metric, we investigate the
wave trace invariants for the basic Laplacian about a non-zero period. We
compare them to the wave invariants of the underlying Riemannian orbifold that
exists when the leaves in the regular region are identified to points, equipped
with the metric that is transverse to the leaves of the foliation. Recalling
that the basic Laplacian differs from the underlying orbifold Laplacian by a
term that is the mean curvature vector field associated to the foliation, we
show that the first wave invariant about any non-zero period $T$ corresponding
to geodesics perpendicular to the leaves that all lie entirely in the regular
region of $M$ is independent of the mean curvature vector field and depends
only on the underlying orbifold structure of the leaf space quotient. Similar
results hold on the singular strata whenever the transverse geodesic flow
remains confined to the strata defined by the leaf dimension of the foliation.
Conversely, closed geodesics that pass through the exceptional leaves depend on
the full laplacian, including the leaf-wise metric on the ambient space. We
also discuss families of representations that yield the same leaf space and
basic spectrum. We use this to give conditions under which non-trivial isotropy

describes local image directionality based on numerical differentiation. Due to
its ill-posed nature, small noise may lead to large errors. Conventional HOG
may fail to produce meaningful directionality results in the presence of noise,
which is common in medical radiographic imaging. We approach the directionality
problem from a novel perspective by the use of the optimal transport map of a
local image patch to a uni-color patch of its mean. We decompose the transport
map into sub-work costs in different directions. We evaluated the ability of
the optimal transport to quantify tumor heterogeneity from brain MRI images of
patients with glioblastoma multiforme from the TCIA. By considering the entropy
difference of the extracted local directionality within tumor regions, we found
that patients with higher entropy in their images, had statistically
significant worse overall survival (p $=0.008$), which indicates that tumors
exhibiting flows in many directions may be more malignant, perhaps reflecting
high tumor histologic grade, a reflection of histologic disorganization. We
also explored the possibility of solving classical image processing problems
such as smoothing and edge detection via optimal transport. By looking for a
2-color patch with minimum transport distance to a local patch, we derive a
nonlinear shock filter, which preserves edges. Moreover, we found that the
color difference of the computed 2-color patch indicates whether there is a
large change in color, i.e., an edge in the given patch. In summary, we expand
the usefulness of optimal transport as an image local analysis tool, to extract
robust measures of imaging tumor heterogeneity for outcomes prediction as well
as image pre-processing. Because of its robust nature, we find it offers
several advantages over the classical approaches.

background Extraction Neural Network (CENN) in order to extract the CMB signal
in total intensity. The frequencies used are the Planck channels 143, 217 and
353 GHz. We validate the network at all sky, and at three latitude intervals:
lat1=0^{\circ}<b<5^{\circ}, lat2=5^{\circ}<b<30^{\circ} and
lat3=30^{\circ}<b<90^{\circ}, without using any Galactic or point source masks.
For training, we make realistic simulations in the form of patches of area 256
pixels, which contain the CMB, Dust, CIB and PS emissions, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect and the instrumental noise. After validate the network, we compare the
power spectrum from input and output maps. We analyse the power spectrum from
the residuals at each latitude interval and at all sky and we study the
performance of our model dealing with high contamination at small scales. We
obtain a power spectrum with an error of 13{\pm}113 {\mu}K^2 for multipoles up

{\mu}K^2 for lat2 and 30{\pm}20 {\mu}K^2 for lat3. For all sky, we obtain
20{\pm}10 {\mu}K^2. We validate the network in a patch with strong
contamination at small scales, obtaining an error of 50{\pm}120 {\mu}K^2 and
residuals of 40{\pm}10 {\mu}K^2. Therefore, fully convolutional neural networks
are promising methods to perform component separation in future CMB
experiments. Particularly, CENN is reliable against different levels of
contamination from Galactic and point source foregrounds at both large and
small scales.

challenging due to the presence of two well-known trade-offs. The first one is
the area-bandwidth trade-off of photodetectors (PDs) and the second one is the
gain-FOV trade-off due to the use of optics. The combined effects of these two
trade-offs imply that the achievable data rate of an imaging optical receiver
is limited by its FOV, i.e., a rate-FOV trade-off. To control the
area-bandwidth trade-off, an array of small PDs can be used instead of a single
PD. Moreover, in practice, a large-area lens is required to ensure sufficient
power collection, which in turn limits the receiver FOV (i.e., gain-FOV
trade-off). We propose an imaging receiver design in the form of an array of
arrays. To achieve a reasonable receiver FOV, we use individual focusing lens
for each PD array rather than a single collection lens for the whole receiver.
The proposed array of arrays structure provides an effective method to control
both gain-FOV trade-off (via an array of lenses) and area-bandwidth trade-off
(via arrays of PDs). We first derive a tractable analytical model for the SNR
of an array of PDs where the maximum ratio combining has been employed. Then,
we extend the model for the proposed array of arrays structure and the accuracy
of the analytical model is verified based on several Optic Studio-based
simulations. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the
achievable data rate of the imaging receiver subject to a minimum required FOV.
The optimization problem is solved for two commonly used modulation techniques,
namely, OOK and direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing with variable rate quadrature amplitude modulation. It is
demonstrated that a data rate of ~ 24 Gbps with a FOV of 15 is achievable using
OOK with a total receiver size of 2 cm by 2 cm.

is represented as a polyline composed of a vertical segment with its lowest
endpoint at the tail of $e$ and of a horizontal segment ending at the head of

L-drawings have been studied for $st$-graphs, i.e., planar DAGs with a single
source $s$ and a single sink $t$ containing an edge directed from $s$ to $t$.
It is known that a plane $st$-graph, i.e., an embedded $st$-graph in which the
edge $(s,t)$ is incident to the outer face, admits an upward-planar L-drawing
if and only if it admits a bitonic $st$-ordering, which can be tested in linear
time.
  We study upward-planar L-drawings of DAGs that are not necessarily
$st$-graphs. On the combinatorial side, we show that a plane DAG admits an
upward-planar L-drawing if and only if it is a subgraph of a plane $st$-graph

with a fixed bimodal embedding admits an upward-planar L-drawing. Moreover, we
prove that any acyclic cactus with a single source (or a single sink) admits an
upward-planar L-drawing, which respects a given outerplanar embedding if there
are no transitive edges. On the algorithmic side, we consider DAGs with a
single source (or a single sink). We give linear-time testing algorithms for
these DAGs in two cases: (i) when the drawing must respect a prescribed
embedding and (ii) when no restriction is given on the embedding, but it is
biconnected and series-parallel.

Earth's diameter above 10's of TeV energies. Over terrestrial distances, the
tau's short lifetime leads to an energetic regenerated tau neutrino flux, tau
neutrino to tau to tau neutrino, within the Earth. The next generation of
neutrino experiments aim to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos. Many of them
rely on detecting either the regenerated tau neutrino, or a tau decay shower.
Both of these signatures can be affected by the polarization of the tau through
the energy distribution of the secondary particles produced from the tau's
decay. While taus produced in weak interactions are nearly 100 percent
polarized, it is expected that taus experience some depolarization due to
electromagnetic interactions in the Earth. In this paper, for the first time we
quantify the depolarization of taus in electromagnetic energy loss. We find
that tau depolarization has only small effects on the final energy of tau
neutrinos or taus produced by high energy tau neutrinos incident on the Earth.
Tau depolarization can be directly implemented in Monte Carlo simulations such

feedback controller with a feedforward. The control objective is to track the
intake manifold pressure and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate targets by
manipulating the EGR valve and variable geometry turbine (VGT) while satisfying
state and input constraints. The feedback controller is based on rate-based
Model Predictive Control (MPC) that provides integral action for tracking. Two
options for the feedforward are considered one based on a look-up table that
specifies the feedforward as a function of engine speed and fuel injection
rate, and another one based on a (non-rate-based) MPC that generates dynamic
feedforward trajectories. The controllers are designed and verified using a
high-fidelity engine model in GT-Power and exploit a low-order rate-based
linear parameter-varying (LPV) model for prediction which is identified from
transient response data generated by the GT-Power model. It is shown that the
combination of feedforward and feedback MPC has the potential to improve the
performance and robustness of the control design. In particular, the feedback
MPC without feedforward can lose stability at low engine speeds, while
MPC-based feedforward results in the best transient response. Mechanisms by
which feedforward is able to assist in stabilization and improve performance
are discussed.

from different pulsars. The expected correlation $\mu(\gamma)$ as a function of
the angle $\gamma$ between the directions to two pulsars was calculated by
Hellings and Downs for an isotropic and unpolarized GW background, and several
pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations are working to observe these. We ask:
given a set of noise-free observations, are they consistent with that
expectation? To answer this, we calculate the expected variance
$\sigma^2(\gamma)$ in the correlation for a single GW point source, as pulsar
pairs with fixed separation angle $\gamma$ are swept around the sky. We then
use this to derive simple analytic expressions for the variance produced by a
set of discrete point sources uniformly scattered in space for two cases of
interest: (1) point sources radiating GWs at the same frequency, generating
confusion noise, and (2) point sources radiating GWs at distinct
non-overlapping frequencies. By averaging over all pulsar sky positions at
fixed separation angle $\gamma$, we show how this variance may be cleanly split
into cosmic variance and pulsar variance, also demonstrating that measurements
of the variance can provide information about the nature of GW sources. In a
series of technical appendices, we calculate the mean and variance of the
Hellings-Downs correlation for an arbitrary (polarized) point source, quantify
the impact of neglecting pulsar terms, and calculate the pulsar and cosmic
variance for a Gaussian ensemble. The mean and variance of the Gaussian
ensemble may also be obtained from the previous discrete-source confusion-noise
model in the limit of a high density of weak sources.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (e.g. adapter modules, prompt tuning,

several of the massive (million or billion solar mass) molecular outflows
observed in galaxies. These outflows could suppress or enhance star formation
in galaxies. To investigate the stability of clouds capable to form stars in
outflows, we modeled CO and HCO+ ALMA data of the galaxy IC5063, in which
black-hole jets impact molecular clouds. Using a radiative transfer code that
self-consistently performs astrochemical and thermal balance calculations based
on the available gas heating sources, we found that mechanical heating and
cosmic ray (CR) heating are fully capable of individually reproducing the data.
In our best-fit model, CRs provide about 1/3rd of the dense gas heating at the
radio lobes, emphasizing the role of this often neglected mechanism in heating
the gas and potentially generating outflows. The gas temperature and density
indicate that the jet passage leads to an increase of about 1 order of
magnitude in the internal pressure Pi of molecular clouds (with Pi/k from
8*10^5 up to 7*10^6 K cm^-3), irrespective of the excitation mechanism. From
the fluxes of [S II] and [N II] lines in VLT MUSE data, the external pressure
Pe of molecular clouds increases in several regions enough to exceed Pi. This
result leads us to conclude that we are observing the expansion of an ionized
overpressurized cocoon that compresses molecular clouds and that could lead to
their collapse. Some jet-impacted clouds, nonetheless, near pathways that the
jet cleared have increased Pi and decreased Pe. They are likely to undergo
evaporation of their outer layers. Part of the evaporated layers could mass
load the outflow thanks to ram pressure from co-spatial ionized gas flows. The
observed pressure changes thus suggest that both star formation enhancement and
suppression could simultaneously occur.

Finding other string transformations with the same remarkable properties of BWT

variants, the only one that has been recently shown to be a valid alternative
to BWT is the Alternating BWT (ABWT), another invertible string transformation
introduced about ten years ago in connection with a generalization of Lyndon
words. In this paper, we introduce a whole class of new string transformations,

of BWT. We show that this new family is a special case of a much larger class

BWT and ABWT. Although all transformations support pattern search, we show
that, in the general case, the transformations within our larger class may take
quadratic time for inversion and pattern search. As a further result, we show
that the local orderings-based transformations can be used for the construction

bounds the suboptimality of the warm-start by altering the reference command

are ordered by a given ranking function (e.g., an ORDER BY clause in SQL). We
develop ""any-k"" algorithms which, without knowing the number k of desired
answers, push the ranking into joins and avoid materializing the join output
earlier than necessary. For this to be possible, the ranking function needs to
obey a certain kind of monotonicity; the supported ranking functions include
the common sum-of-weights case where query answers are compared by sums of
input weights, as well as any commutative selective dioid. One core insight of
our work is that the problem is closely related to the fundamental task of path
enumeration in a weighted DAG. We generalize and improve upon classic research
on finding the k'th shortest path and unify into the same framework several
solutions from different areas that had been studied in isolation. For the time
to the k'th ranked CQ answer (for every value of k), our approach is optimal in
data complexity precisely for the same class of queries where unranked
enumeration is optimal -- and only slower by a logarithmic factor. In a more
careful analysis of combined complexity, we uncover a previously unknown
tradeoff between two different any-k algorithms: one has lower complexity when
the number of returned results is small, the other when the number is very
large. This tradeoff is eliminated under a stricter monotonicity property that
we exploit to design a novel algorithm that asymptotically dominates all
previously known alternatives, including the well-known algorithm of Eppstein
for sum-of-weights path enumeration. We empirically demonstrate the findings of
our theoretical analysis in an experimental study that highlights the
superiority of our approach over the join-then-rank approach that existing

top quark are generally difficult to probe, and can generate sizable loop
contributions to the electroweak precision observables, measured by past and
future lepton colliders. Could the high precision of the electroweak
measurements compensate the loop suppression and provide competitive reaches on
these operators? Would the inclusion of these contributions introduce too many
additional parameters for a meaningful global electroweak analysis to be done?
In this paper, we perform a detailed phenomenological study to address these
two important questions. Focusing on eight dimension-6 operators that generate
anomalous couplings between the electroweak gauge bosons and the
third-generation quarks, we calculate their one loop contributions to the
$e^+e^- \to f\bar{f}$ processes both on and off the Z-pole and the $e^-e^+ \to
WW$ process. A global analysis is performed with these eight operators and the
ones that contribute to the above processes at tree level, using the
measurements at LEP, SLC and several low energy experiments. We find that,
while the current electroweak precision measurements are sensitive to the
one-loop effects of the top-quark operators, it is difficult to separate them
from the operators that contribute at the tree level, making a global analysis
rather challenging. Under more assumptions, competitive reaches could be
obtained in a global fit. Another important finding of our study is that the
two operators that generate dipole interactions of the bottom quark have
significant impacts in the Z-pole measurements and should not be omitted. We
also discuss the implication of the recently reported W-boson mass measurement
at CDF to our results. Finally, we estimate the reaches of future lepton

loans, and perceived huge obligations towards loan platforms. Users fulfilled
obligations by accepting harsh terms and conditions, over-sharing sensitive

demonstrated a dependence on loan platforms by persisting with such behaviors
despite risks of harms such as abuse, recurring debts, discrimination, privacy
harms, and self-harm to them. Instead of being enraged with loan platforms,
users assumed responsibility for their negative experiences, thus releasing the
high-powered loan platforms from accountability obligations. We argue that
accountability is shaped by platform-user power relations, and urge caution to
policymakers in adopting a purely technical approach to fostering algorithmic
accountability. Instead, we call for situated interventions that enhance agency

predict habitability signatures that can be searched for with future

spectra of this reflected light. With an adding-doubling algorithm, we compute
the total flux F, polarized flux Q and degree of polarization P of starlight
reflected by dry and ocean model planets with Earth-like atmospheres and patchy
clouds. The oceans consist of Fresnel reflecting surfaces with wind-ruffled
waves, foam and wave shadows, above natural blue seawater. Our results are
presented as functions of wavelength (from 300 to 2500 nm with 1 nm resolution)
and as functions of the planetary phase angle from 90 to 170 degrees. The ocean
glint increases F, |Q| and P with increasing phase angle at non-absorbing
wavelengths, and causes the spectra of F and |Q| for the various phase angles
to intersect. In the near-infrared, Q is negative, i.e. the direction of
polarization is perpendicular to the plane through the star, planet, and
observer. In the P-spectra, the glint leaves dips (instead of peaks) in gaseous
absorption bands. All those signatures are missing in the spectra of dry
planets. The dips in P, and the negative Q in the near-infrared, can be
searched for at a phase angle of 90 degrees, where the planet-star separation
is largest. Those ocean signatures in polarized light do not suffer from false
positive glint signals that could be due to clouds or reflecting dry surfaces.
For heavily cloudy planets, ocean detection is possible when the glint is
(partially) cloud-free. When modelling signals of planets with oceans, using
horizontally inhomogeneous cloud covers is thus crucial. Observations spread
over time would increase the probability of catching a cloud-free glint and
detecting an ocean.

networks with the structural re-parameterization technique. The general
pipeline of re-parameterization is to train networks with multi-branch topology
first, and then merge them into standard 3x3 convolutions for efficient
inference. In this work, we revisit those primary designs and investigate
essential components for re-parameterizing SR networks. First of all, we find
that batch normalization (BN) is important to bring training non-linearity and
improve the final performance. However, BN is typically ignored in SR, as it
usually degrades the performance and introduces unpleasant artifacts. We
carefully analyze the cause of BN issue and then propose a straightforward yet
effective solution. In particular, we first train SR networks with mini-batch
statistics as usual, and then switch to using population statistics at the
later training period. While we have successfully re-introduced BN into SR, we
further design a new re-parameterizable block tailored for SR, namely RepSR. It
consists of a clean residual path and two expand-and-squeeze convolution paths
with the modified BN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple RepSR
is capable of achieving superior performance to previous SR re-parameterization
methods among different model sizes. In addition, our RepSR can achieve a
better trade-off between performance and actual running time (throughput) than
previous SR methods. Codes will be available at

as the discrete droplet method (DDM), the model captures the evolution of thin
fluid films by tracking individual moving fluid droplets. In contrast to
existing thin film models that solve a PDE to determine the film height, here,
we compute the film height by numerical integration based on the aggregation of
droplets. The novelty of this approach in using droplets makes it suitable for
simulating the formation of fluid films, and modelling thin film flows on
partially wetted surfaces. The DDM is a Lagrangian approach, with a force
balance on each droplet governing the motion, and derivatives approximated
using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) like approach. The proposed model
is thoroughly validated by comparing results against analytical solutions,
against the results of the shallow-water equations for thin film flow, and also
against results from a full 3D resolved Navier Stokes model. We also present
the use of the DDM on an industrial test case. The results highlight the

promising probe of the local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) parameter $f_{\rm
NL}$, but the amplitude of the effect is proportional to $f_{\rm NL}b_{\phi}$,
where $b_{\phi}$ is the linear PNG galaxy bias parameter. Our knowledge of
$b_{\phi}$ is currently very limited, yet nearly all existing $f_{\rm NL}$
constraints and forecasts assume precise knowledge for it. Here, we use the
BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectrum to illustrate how our uncertain knowledge of
$b_{\phi}$ currently prevents us from constraining $f_{\rm NL}$ with a given
statistical precision $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$. Assuming different fixed choices
for the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and the linear density bias $b_1$, we find
that $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ can vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Our
strongest bound is $f_{\rm NL} = 16 \pm 16\ (1\sigma)$, while the loosest is
$f_{\rm NL} = 230 \pm 226\ (1\sigma)$ for the same BOSS data. The impact of
$b_{\phi}$ can be especially pronounced because it can be close to zero. We
also show how marginalizing over $b_{\phi}$ with wide priors is not
conservative, and leads in fact to biased constraints through parameter space
projection effects. Independently of galaxy bias assumptions, the
scale-dependent bias effect can only be used to detect $f_{\rm NL} \neq 0$ by
constraining the product $f_{\rm NL}b_{\phi}$, but the error bar
$\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ remains undetermined and the results cannot be compared
with the CMB; we find $f_{\rm NL}b_{\phi} \neq 0$ with $1.6\sigma$
significance. We also comment on why these issues are important for analyses
with the galaxy bispectrum. Our results strongly motivate simulation-based
research programs aimed at robust theoretical priors for the $b_{\phi}$
parameter, without which we may never be able to competitively constrain
$f_{\rm NL}$ using galaxy data.

solve this practical problem, each being claimed effective in some ways. Yet, a
benchmark to compare those algorithms directly is lacking, mainly due to the
complexity of the algorithms and some custom settings such as the particular
network configuration or training procedure. A fair benchmark is important for
the further development of channel pruning.
  Meanwhile, recent investigations reveal that the channel configurations
discovered by pruning algorithms are at least as important as the pre-trained
weights. This gives channel pruning a new role, namely searching the optimal
channel configuration. In this paper, we try to determine the channel
configuration of the pruned models by random search. The proposed approach
provides a new way to compare different methods, namely how well they behave
compared with random pruning. We show that this simple strategy works quite
well compared with other channel pruning methods. We also show that under this
setting, there are surprisingly no clear winners among different channel
importance evaluation methods, which then may tilt the research efforts into
advanced channel configuration searching methods.

formulate a new loss on rendering variances using gradients from differentiable

stellar feedback. However, we still do not have strong observational
constraints on the relative importance of the different feedback mechanisms

evolution and molecular cloud disruption. In this letter, we constrain the
relative importance of the various feedback mechanisms from young massive star
populations by resolving HII regions across the disk of the nearby star-forming
galaxy NGC 1672. We combine measurements of ionised gas nebular lines obtained
by PHANGS-MUSE, with high-resolution imaging from the HST in both the
narrow-band H{\alpha} and broad-band filters. We identify a sample of 40
isolated, compact HII regions in the HST H{\alpha} image, for which we measure
the sizes that were previously unresolved in seeing-limited ground-based
observations. Additionally, we identify the ionisation source(s) for each HII
region from catalogues produced as part of the PHANGS-HST survey. We find that
the HII regions investigated are mildly dominated by thermal or wind pressure,
yet their elevation above the radiation pressure is within the expected
uncertainty range. We see that radiation pressure provides a substantially
higher contribution to the total pressure than previously found in the
literature over similar size scales. In general, we find higher pressures
within more compact HII regions, which is driven by the inherent size scaling
relations of each pressure term, albeit with significant scatter introduced by
the variation in the stellar population properties (e.g. luminosity, mass, age,
metallicity). For nearby galaxies, here we provide a promising approach that
could yield the statistics required to map out how the importance of different
stellar feedback mechanisms evolve over the lifetime of an HII region.

apparent substantial baryon excess in the midrapidity region. It was proposed
that baryon number could be carried by a non-perturbative Y-shaped topology of
gluon fields, called the baryon junction, rather than by the valence quarks.
The stopping of baryon junctions is predicted to lead to a characteristic
exponential distribution of net-baryon density with rapidity and could resolve
the puzzle. In this context we point out that the rapidity density of
net-baryons near midrapidity indeed follows an exponential distribution with a
slope of $-0.61\pm0.03$ as a function of beam rapidity in the existing global
data from A+A collisions at AGS, SPS and RHIC energies. To further test if
quarks or gluon junctions carry the baryon quantum number, we propose to study
the absolute magnitude of the baryon vs. charge stopping in isobar collisions
at RHIC. We also argue that semi-inclusive photon-induced processes

signatures of the baryon junction and to shed light onto the mechanisms of
observed baryon excess in the mid-rapidity region in ultra-relativistic

While it is known that the geometry of the junction strongly influences the
size of the topological gap, the question of how to construct optimal
geometries remains unexplored. We introduce a greedy numerical algorithm to
optimize the shape of Majorana junctions. The core of the algorithm relies on
perturbation theory and is embarrassingly parallel, which allows it to explore
the design space efficiently. By introducing stochastic variations in the
junction Hamiltonian, we avoid overfitting geometries to specific system
parameters. Furthermore, we constrain the optimizer to produce smooth
geometries by applying image filtering and fabrication resolution constraints.
We run the algorithm in various setups and find that it reliably produces
geometries with increased topological gaps over large parameter ranges. The
results are robust to variations in the optimization starting point and the
presence of disorder, which suggests the optimizer is capable of finding global

wide binaries, with mass ratio $q\gtrsim 0.95$, extending to separations of at
least 1000 AU. The origin of this population is an enigma: twin binaries are
thought to form via correlated accretion in circumbinary disks, but the typical
observed protostellar disks have radii of $\sim100$ AU, far smaller than the
separations of the widest twins. Here, we infer the eccentricity distribution
of wide twins from the distribution of their $v$-$r$ angles, i.e., the angle
between the components' separation and relative velocity vectors. We find that
wide twins must be on extremely eccentric orbits. For the excess-twin
population at 400-1000 AU, we infer a near-delta function excess of
high-eccentricity system, with eccentricity $0.95 \lesssim e \leq 1$. These
high eccentricities for wide twins imply pericenter distances of order $10$ AU
and suggest that their orbits were scattered via dynamical interactions in
their birth environments, consistent with a scenario in which twins are born in
circumbinary disks and subsequently widened. These results further establish
twin wide binaries as a distinct population and imply that wide twins can be
used as a probe of the dynamical history of stellar populations.

tiling using concentric layers of tiles. The models in this class are aperiodic
spin chains, whose sequences of couplings are obtained from the bulk inflation

strong disorder renormalization group techniques, which provide a tensor
network construction for the ground state of this spin chain. This can be
regarded as discrete bulk reconstruction. Moreover we compute the entanglement
entropy in this setup in two different ways: a discretization of the
Ryu-Takayanagi formula and a generalization of the standard computation for the
boundary aperiodic Hamiltonian. For both approaches, a logarithmic growth of
the entanglement entropy in the subsystem size is identified. The coefficients,

opportunities to characterise the star formation history of the Universe back
to the epoch of reionisation, and to measure the chemical composition of
interstellar and intergalactic gas through absorption spectroscopy. The main
barrier to progress is the low efficiency in rapidly and confidently
identifying which bursts are high redshift ($z > 5$) candidates before they
fade, as this requires low-latency follow-up observations at near-infrared
wavelengths (or longer) to determine a reliable photometric redshift estimate.
So far this task has been performed by instruments on the ground, but sky
visibility and weather constraints limit the number of GRB targets that can be
observed and the speed at which follow-up is possible. In this work we develop
a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate an alternative approach based
on the use of a rapid-response near-infrared nano-satellite, capable of
simultaneous imaging in four bands from $0.8$ to $1.7\mu$m (a mission concept
called SkyHopper). We find that such a nano-satellite is capable of detecting
in the H band (1.6 $\mu$m) $72.5\% \pm 3.1\%$ of GRBs concurrently observable
with the Swift satellite via its UVOT instrument (and $44.1\% \pm 12.3\%$ of
high redshift ($z>5$) GRBs) within 60 minutes of the GRB prompt emission. This
corresponds to detecting $\sim 55$ GRB afterglows per year, of which 1-3 have
$z > 5$. These rates represent a substantial contribution to the field of
high-$z$ GRB science, as only 23 $z > 5$ GRBs have been collectively discovered
by the entire astronomical community over the last $\sim 24$ years.
Additionally, we find that launching a mini-constellation of 3 near-infrared
nano-satellites would increase the detection fraction of afterglows to $\sim
83\%$ and substantially reduce the latency in the photometric redshift
determination.

field theory that exhibits the Vainshtein screening mechanism, which is
incorporated into many extensions to Einstein gravity. The Galileon describes
the helicity zero mode of gravitational radiation, the presence of which has
significant implications for predictions of gravitational waves from orbiting
objects, and for tests of gravity sensitive to additional polarizations.
Because of the derivative nature of their interactions, Galileons are
superficially not well-posed as effective field theories. Although this
property is properly understood merely as an artifact of the effective field
theory truncation, and is not theoretically worrisome, at the practical level
it nevertheless renders numerical simulation highly problematic.
Notwithstanding, previous numerical approaches have successfully evolved the
system for reasonable initial data by slowly turning on the interactions. We
present here two alternative approaches to improving numerical stability in
Galileon numerical simulations. One of these is a minor modification of
previous approaches, which introduces a low pass filter that amounts to
imposing a UV cutoff together with a relaxation method of turning on
interactions. The second approach amounts to constructing a (numerical) UV
completion for which the dynamics of the high momentum modes is under control,
and for which it is unnecessary to slowly turn on nonlinear interactions. We
show that numerical simulations of the UV theory successfully reproduce the
correct Galileon dynamics at low energies, consistent with the low-pass filter
method and with previous numerical simulations.

detailing the unique stance of our ""Single-Class Supervision"" (SCS) setting
with respect to related concepts such as partial supervision and semi
supervision. Then, based on the case study of training the multi-class version
of Range Sparse Net (RSN), we adapt a spectrum of algorithms -- from supervised

that proper training under SCS can approach or match full supervision training

dynamical systems including a formal definition of the ergodic hierarchy.
Closely related to this hierarchy is a less-known notion of cyclic approximate
periodic transformations [see, e.g., I. Cornfield, S. Fomin, and Y. Sinai,
Ergodic theory (Springer-Verlag New York, 1982)], which maps any ""ergodic""
dynamical system to a cyclic permutation on a circle and arguably represents
the most elementary notion of ergodicity. This paper shows that cyclic
ergodicity generalizes to quantum dynamical systems, and this generalization is
proposed here as the basic rigorous definition of quantum ergodicity. It
implies the ability to construct an orthonormal basis, where quantum dynamics
transports an initial basis vector to all other basis vectors one by one, while
maintaining a sufficiently large overlap between the time-evolved initial state
and a given basis state. It is proven that the basis, maximizing the overlap
over all cyclic permutations, is obtained via the discrete Fourier transform of
the energy eigenstates. This relates quantum cyclic ergodicity to level
statistics. We then show that the near-universal Wigner-Dyson level statistics
implies quantum cyclic ergodicity, but the reverse is not necessarily true. For
the latter, we study irrational flows on a 2D torus and prove that both the
classical and quantum flows are cyclic ergodic. However, the corresponding
level statistics is neither Wigner-Dyson nor Poisson. Finally, we use the
cyclic construction to motivate a quantum ergodic hierarchy of operators and
argue that under the additional assumption of Poincare recurrences, cyclic
ergodicity is a necessary condition for such operators to satisfy the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. This work provides a general framework
for transplanting some rigorous concepts of ergodic theory to quantum dynamical
systems.

TOI-2152 (TIC 395393265), TOI-2154 (TIC 428787891), & TOI-2497 (TIC 97568467).
All six planets orbit bright host stars (8.9 <G< 11.8, 7.7 <K< 10.1). Using a
combination of time-series photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations
from the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Working Group, we have
determined that the planets are Jovian-sized (R$_{P}$ = 1.00-1.45 R$_{J}$),
have masses ranging from 0.92 to 5.35 M$_{J}$, and orbit F, G, and K stars
(4753 $<$ T$_{eff}$ $<$ 7360 K). We detect a significant orbital eccentricity
for the three longest-period systems in our sample: TOI-2025 b (P = 8.872 days,
$e$ = $0.220\pm0.053$), TOI-2145 b (P = 10.261 days, $e$ =
$0.182^{+0.039}_{-0.049}$), and TOI-2497 b (P = 10.656 days, $e$ =
$0.196^{+0.059}_{-0.053}$). TOI-2145 b and TOI-2497 b both orbit subgiant host
stars (3.8 $<$ $\log$ g $<$4.0), but these planets show no sign of inflation
despite very high levels of irradiation. The lack of inflation may be explained
by the high mass of the planets; $5.35^{+0.32}_{-0.35}$ M$_{\rm J}$ (TOI-2145
b) and $5.21\pm0.52$ M$_{\rm J}$ (TOI-2497 b). These six new discoveries
contribute to the larger community effort to use {\it TESS} to create a
magnitude-complete, self-consistent sample of giant planets with
well-determined parameters for future detailed studies.

recovering the causal order among a subgraph of variables known to descend from
some (possibly large) set of confounding covariates, i.e. a $\textit{confounder

maintaining polynomial time complexity. We present a structure learning
algorithm that is provably sound and complete with respect to a so-called
$\textit{lazy oracle}$. We design inference procedures with finite sample error

hydrodynamic simulations. The underlying galaxy formation model is the same as
in IllustrisTNG. Using constrained initial conditions, we study the growth of
BHs in rare overdense regions (forming $\gtrsim10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$ halos by
$z=7$) using a $(9~\mathrm{Mpc}/h)^3$ simulated volume. BH growth is maximal
within halos that are compact and have a low tidal field. For these halos, we
consider an array of gas-based seeding prescriptions wherein
$M_{\mathrm{seed}}=10^4-10^6~M_{\odot}/h$ seeds are inserted in halos above
critical thresholds for halo mass and dense, metal-poor gas mass (defined as
$\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$ and $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$, respectively, in
units of $M_{\mathrm{seed}}$). We find that a seed model with
$\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}=5$ and $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}=3000$ successfully
produces a $z\sim6$ quasar with $\sim10^9~M_{\odot}$ mass and
$\sim10^{47}~\mathrm{ergs~s^ {-1}}$ luminosity. BH mergers play a crucial role
at $z\gtrsim9$, causing an early boost in BH mass at a time when
accretion-driven BH growth is negligible. When more stringent seeding
conditions are applied (for e.g., $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}=1000$), the
relative paucity of BH seeds results in a much lower merger rate. In this case,
$z\gtrsim6$ quasars can only be formed if we enhance the maximum allowed BH
accretion rates (by factors $\gtrsim10$) compared to the accretion model used
in IllustrisTNG. This can be achieved either by allowing for super-Eddington
accretion, or by reducing the radiative efficiency. Our results show that
progenitors of $z\sim6$ quasars have distinct BH merger histories for different
seeding models, which will be distinguishable with LISA observations.

minimizers of a linear folding model by discontinuous isoparametric finite
element functions that account for an approximation of a folding arc. The
numerical analysis of the discrete model includes an a priori error estimate in
case of an accurate representation of the folding curve by the isoparametric

controlled separately if the folding arc is approximated by piecewise
polynomial curves. Various numerical experiments are carried out to validate
the a priori error estimate for the folding model.

X-ray monitoring campaign taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array

Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). We also analyse the X-ray temporal behaviour using
observations from the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER).
Results show a seemingly peculiar X-ray spectral evolution of MAXI J1810-222
during this outburst, where the source was initially only detected in the soft
X-ray band for the early part of the outburst. Then, ~200 days after MAXI
J1810-222 was first detected the hard X-ray emission increased and the source
transitioned to a long-lived (~1.5 years) bright, harder X-ray state. After
this hard state, MAXI J1810-222 returned back to a softer state, before fading
and transitioning again to a harder state and then appearing to follow a more
typical outburst decay. From the X-ray spectral and timing properties, and the
source's radio behaviour, we argue that the results from this study are most
consistent with MAXI J1810-222 being a relatively distant ($\gtrsim$6 kpc)
black hole X-ray binary. A sufficiently large distance to source can simply
explain the seemingly odd outburst evolution that was observed, where only the
brightest portion of the outburst was detectable by the all-sky X-ray
telescopes.

excitations, they can undergo a phase transition to a condensed state that can
emit coherent light without a population inversion. This aspect makes them good
candidates for thresholdless lasers, yet short exciton-polariton lifetime has
made it difficult to achieve condensation at very low power densities. In this
sense, long-lived symmetry-protected states are excellent candidates to
overcome the limitations that arise from the finite mirror reflectivity of
monolithic microcavities. In this work we use a photonic symmetry protected
bound state in the continuum coupled to an excitonic resonance to achieve
state-of-the-art polariton condensation threshold in GaAs/AlGaAs waveguide.
Most important, we show the influence of fabrication control and how surface
passivation via atomic layer deposition provides a way to reduce exciton

effective radii of both the CO $J$=2-1 line and 870 $\mu$m dust continuum

We find that the CO $J$=2-1 line emission in all of the nine galaxies is more
extended than the dust continuum emission by a factor of $2.8\pm1.4$. We
investigate the spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation in two
regions within the interstellar medium of the galaxies. The relation for our
sample reveals that the central region ($0<r<R_{e,{\rm 870\mu m}}$) of galaxies
tends to have a shorter gas depletion timescale, i.e., a higher star formation
efficiency, compared to the extended region ($R_{e,{\rm 870\mu m}}<r<R_{e,{\rm

concentrated inside the extended gas reservoir, possibly resulting in the
formation of a bulge structure. We find consistency between the ALMA 870 $\mu$m

of passive members in a mass-size distribution, which suggests a transition
from star-forming to passive members within $\sim0.5$ Gyr. In addition, no

the expansion scalar $ \Theta $, of the background space-time, is proportional
to the shear scalar $ \sigma $, we have solved the background field equations
in the presence of matter (found to behave like a stiff fluid). We then derive
the linearised perturbation equations for both the axial and polar modes. The
analytical solutions in vacuum spacetime could be determined in an earlier
paper \cite{GD1} in a relatively straightforward manner. However, here we find
that in the presence of matter they require more assumptions for their
solution, and bear more involved forms. We use both analytical and numerical
methods to find the solutions for the axial perturbations. As compared to the
axial modes, the polar perturbation equations contain far more complicated
couplings among the perturbing terms. Thus we have to apply suitable
assumptions to derive the analytical solutions for some of the cases of polar
perturbations. In both the axial and polar cases, the radial and temporal
solutions for the perturbations separate out as products. We find that the
axial waves are damped owing to the background anisotropy, and can deform only
the azimuthal velocity of the fluid. In contrast, the polar waves must trigger
perturbations in the energy density, the pressure as well as in the
non-azimuthal components of the fluid velocity. Similar behavior is exhibited
by axial and polar waves propagating in the Kantowski-Sachs universe

detecting harmful, hateful, and offensive memes, identifying whom they attack

In particular, we create a dataset where we annotate each meme with its

However, it is insufficient to describe the local geometry directly. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RepSurf} (representative surfaces), a novel
representation of point clouds to \textbf{explicitly} depict the very local

RepSurf inspired by triangle meshes and umbrella curvature in computer
graphics. We compute the representations of RepSurf by predefined geometric
priors after surface reconstruction. RepSurf can be a plug-and-play module for
most point cloud models thanks to its free collaboration with irregular points.
Based on a simple baseline of PointNet++ (SSG version), Umbrella RepSurf
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin for classification,
segmentation and detection on various benchmarks in terms of performance and
efficiency. With an increase of around \textbf{0.008M} number of parameters,
\textbf{0.04G} FLOPs, and \textbf{1.12ms} inference time, our method achieves
\textbf{94.7\%} (+0.5\%) on ModelNet40, and \textbf{84.6\%} (+1.8\%) on
ScanObjectNN for classification, while \textbf{74.3\%} (+0.8\%) mIoU on S3DIS
6-fold, and \textbf{70.0\%} (+1.6\%) mIoU on ScanNet for segmentation. For
detection, previous state-of-the-art detector with our RepSurf obtains

physics is of fundamental interest and important for developing predictive
tools and closure models for integrated transition-to-turbulence computations.
The flow-thermodynamic interactions are examined using linear analysis and
direct numerical simulations (DNS) in the following parameter regime: $0.5 \leq
M \leq 8$; and, $0.5 \leq Pr \leq 1.3$. For adiabatic wall boundary condition,
increasing Prandtl number has a destabilizing effect. In this work, we
characterize the behavior of production, pressure-strain correlation and
pressure-dilatation as functions of Mach and Prandtl numbers. First and second

More and more customers who outsource their infrastructure benefit from the
manageability, scalability and cost saving that come with cloud computing.
Those benefits get amplified by the trend towards microservices. Instead of
renting and maintaining full VMs, customers increasingly leverage container
technologies, which come with a much more lightweight resource footprint while
also removing the need to emulate complete systems and their devices.
  However, privacy concerns hamper many customers from moving to the cloud and
leveraging its benefits. Furthermore, regulatory requirements prevent the
adaption of cloud computing in many industries, such as health care or finance.
Standard software isolation mechanisms have been proven to be insufficient if
the host system is not fully trusted, e.g., when the cloud infrastructure gets
compromised by malicious third-party actors. Consequently, confidential
computing is gaining increasing relevance in the cloud computing field.
  We present Trusted Container Extensions (TCX), a novel container security
architecture, which combines the manageability and agility of standard
containers with the strong protection guarantees of hardware-enforced Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable confidential computing for container
workloads. TCX provides significant performance advantages compared to existing
approaches while protecting container workloads and the data processed by them.
Our implementation, based on AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), ensures
integrity and confidentiality of data and services during deployment, and
allows secure interaction between protected containers as well as to external
entities. Our evaluation shows that our implementation induces a low

matter experts to feel confident in their decision to use a model. As a result,
models may fail in unexpected ways or go entirely unused, as subject matter
experts disregard poorly presented models in favor of familiar, yet arguably
substandard methods. In this paper, we describe an iterative study conducted
with both subject matter experts and data scientists to understand the gaps in

share common goals of understanding the data and predictions of the model,
friction can stem from unfamiliar terms, metrics, and visualizations - limiting
the transfer of knowledge to SMEs and discouraging clarifying questions being

distribution and fragmentation functions. A TMD factorization approach to the
phenomenology of semi-inclusive processes that includes evolution, higher
orders, and matching to larger transverse momentum, is ultimately necessary for
reliably connecting with phenomenologically extracted nonperturbative
structures, especially when widely different scales are involved. In this
paper, we will address some of the difficulties that arise when
phenomenological techniques that were originally designed for very high energy
applications are extended to studies of hadron structures, and we will solidify
the connection between standard high energy TMD implementations and the more
intuitive, parton model based approaches to phenomenology that emphasize
nonperturbative hadron structure. In the process, we will elaborate on
differences between forward and backward TMD evolution, which in the context of
this paper we call ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" approaches, and we will explain
the advantages of a bottom-up strategy. We will also emphasize and clarify the
role of the integral relations that connect TMD and collinear correlation
functions. We will show explicitly how they constrain the nonperturbative
""$g$-functions"" of standard Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) implementations of TMD
factorization. This paper is especially targeted toward phenomenologists and
model builders who are interested in merging specific nonperturbative models

optimization of antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The hybrid EP-PSO algorithm
uses an evolutionary optimization approach that incorporates swarm directions
in the standard self-adaptive EP algorithm. As examples, we have applied this
hybrid technique to two antenna problems: the side-lobe-level reduction of a
non-uniform spaced (aperiodic) linear array and the beam shaping of a printed
antenna loaded with a partially reflective metasurface. Detailed comparisons
between the proposed hybrid EP-PSO technique and EP-only and PSO-only
techniques are given, demonstrating the efficiency of this hybrid technique in
the complex antenna design problems.

collisions between moving parts and their surroundings must be avoided. To
define feasible design spaces for each part's shape, ""maximal"" collision-free
pointsets can be computed using configuration space modeling techniques such as
Minkowski operations and sweep/unsweep. For example, for a pair of parts
undergoing a given relative motion, to make the problem well-posed, the
geometry of one part (chosen arbitrarily) must be fixed to compute the maximal
shape of the other part by an unsweep operation. Making such arbitrary choices
in a multi-component assembly can place unnecessary restrictions on the design
space. A broader family of collision-free pairs of parts can be explored, if
fixing the geometry of a component is not required. In this paper, we formalize
this family of collision-free shapes and introduce a generic method for
generating a broad subset of them. Our procedure, which is an extension of the
unsweep, allows for co-generation of a pair of geometries which are modified
incrementally and simultaneously to avoid collision. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and scalability of our procedure in both 2D and 3D by generating
a variety of collision-free shapes. Notably, we show that our approach can
automatically generate freeform cam and follower profiles, gear teeth, and
screw threads, starting from colliding blocks of materials, solely from a
specification of relative motion and without the use of any feature-informed
heuristics. Moreover, our approach provides continuous measures of collision
that can be incorporated into standard gradient-descent design optimization,
allowing for simultaneous collision-free and physics-informed co-design of
mechanical parts for assembly.

eliminating such ""bias,"" much less work has gone into rigorously measuring it.
In practice, it important to have high quality, human digestible measures of

this paper, we show both mathematically and through simulation that many of the

relative group-wise model performance disparities along different dimensions,
especially in cases where some sensitive variables consist of categories with
few members. We propose the ""double-corrected"" variance estimator, which
provides unbiased estimates and uncertainty quantification of the variance of
model performance across groups. It is conceptually simple and easily
implementable without statistical software package or numerical optimization.
We demonstrate the utility of this approach through simulation and show on a
real dataset that while statistically biased estimators of group-wise model
performance disparities indicate statistically significant differences, when
accounting for statistical bias in the estimator, the estimated between-group

with relative ease. Efforts to accommodate continuous treatments introduced the
generalized propensity score, yet estimators of this nuisance parameter
commonly utilize parametric regression strategies that sharply limit the
robustness and efficiency of inverse probability weighted estimators of causal
effect parameters. We formulate and investigate a novel, flexible estimator of
the generalized propensity score based on a nonparametric function estimator
that provably converges at a suitably fast rate to the target functional so as
to facilitate statistical inference. With this estimator, we demonstrate the
construction of nonparametric inverse probability weighted estimators of a

Automatic curriculum learning is a recent mechanism comprised of techniques

barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically

formal safety guarantees, while RL-based methods are able to exploit the robot
agility by learning from the full-order system dynamics. However, current
approaches to tackle this problem are mostly restricted to simple systems. In
this paper, we propose a new method to combine model-based safety with
model-free reinforcement learning by explicitly finding a low-dimensional model
of the system controlled by a RL policy and applying stability and safety
guarantees on that simple model. We use a complex bipedal robot Cassie, which
is a high dimensional nonlinear system with hybrid dynamics and underactuation,
and its RL-based walking controller as an example. We show that a
low-dimensional dynamical model is sufficient to capture the dynamics of the
closed-loop system. We demonstrate that this model is linear, asymptotically
stable, and is decoupled across control input in all dimensions. We further
exemplify that such linearity exists even when using different RL control
policies. Such results point out an interesting direction to understand the
relationship between RL and optimal control: whether RL tends to linearize the
nonlinear system during training in some cases. Furthermore, we illustrate that
the found linear model is able to provide guarantees by safety-critical optimal
control framework, e.g., Model Predictive Control with Control Barrier
Functions, on an example of autonomous navigation using Cassie while taking
advantage of the agility provided by the RL-based controller.

magnetic systems of unknown entropy is presented. Commonly used theoretical
approaches interrogate thermal properties from Gibbs/Helmholtz free energies,
which require an accurate model of magnetic interactions. The present approach
avoids this requirement by instead calculating system pressure from thermally
disordered microstates that properly incorporate vibrational and spin
subsystems at each temperature as well as the coupling between these
subsystems. In place of a specific model for magnetic interactions, the
approach integrates measurements of temperature dependent magnetization of the
studied material. We apply the approach to calculate phonon modes and to
investigate the anomalously low thermal expansion of the classical Invar alloy,
Fe_0.65Ni_0.35. The calculated phonon dispersions for Invar are in excellent
agreement with measured data. The Invar thermal expansion is shown to remain
small between 50 K and room temperature, consistent with the experimentally
observed low thermal expansion value in this same temperature range. This
anomalously small thermal expansion is directly connected to a small positive
contribution from lattice thermal disorder that is nearly canceled by a large
negative magnetic disorder contribution. By contrast, calculations for bcc Fe
show a much larger thermal expansion, consistent with experiment, which is
dominated by a large contribution from lattice thermal disorder that is reduced
only slightly by a small negative contribution from that of magnetism. These
findings give insights into the unusual nature of magnetism and spin-lattice
coupling in Invar and Fe, and they support the presented new methodology as a
complementary way to investigate thermal properties of magnetic materials.

dynamics of cells confined in a two-state micropattern, composed of two
rectangular boxes connected by a bridge, and investigate the transition
statistics. A transition between boxes occurs when the active particle crosses
the center of the bridge, and the time between subsequent transitions is the
dwell time. By assuming that the rotational diffusion time $\tau$ is a function
of the position, the main features of the transition statistics observed
experimentally are recovered. $\tau$ controls the transition from a ballistic
regime at short time scales to a diffusive regime at long time scales, with an
effective diffusion coefficient proportional to $\tau$. For small values of
$\tau$, the dwell time is determined by the characteristic diffusion timescale
which decays with $\tau$. For large values of $\tau$, the interaction with the
walls dominates and the particle stays mostly at the corners of the boxes
increasing the dwell time. We find that there is an optimal $\tau$ for which
the dwell time is minimal and its value can be tuned by changing the geometry
of the pattern.

an adaptive method to evaluate the configurational entropy and the mean first
passage times for linear chain models with discontinuous potentials. The
approach is based on event-driven dynamical sampling in a massively parallel
architecture. Using the fact that the transition rate matrix can be calculated
for any choice of interaction energies at any temperature, it is demonstrated
how each state's energy can be chosen such that the average time to transition
between any two states is minimized. The methods are used to analyze the
optimization of the folding process of two protein systems: the crambin
protein, and a model with frustration and misfolding. It is shown that the
folding pathways for both systems are comprised of two regimes: first, the
rapid establishment of local bonds, followed by the subsequent formation of
more distant contacts. The state energies that lead to the most rapid folding
encourage multiple pathways, and either penalize folding pathways through
kinetic traps by raising the energies of trapping states, or establish an

develop novel first-order methods with strong theoretical guarantees for both
policy evaluation and optimization. Existing on-policy evaluation methods
suffer from sub-optimal convergence rates as well as failure in handling
insufficiently random policies, e.g., deterministic policies, for lack of
exploration. To remedy these issues, we develop a novel variance-reduced
temporal difference (VRTD) method with linear function approximation for
randomized policies along with sharp convergence guarantees, and an exploratory
variance-reduced temporal difference (EVRTD) method for insufficiently random
policies with comparable convergence guarantees. We further establish linear
convergence rate on the bias of policy evaluation, which is essential for
improving the overall sample complexity of policy optimization. On the other
hand, compared with intensive research interest in finite sample analysis of
policy gradient methods for discounted MDPs, existing studies on policy
gradient methods for AMDPs mostly focus on regret bounds under restrictive
assumptions on the underlying Markov processes (see, e.g., Abbasi-Yadkori et
al., 2019), and they often lack guarantees on the overall sample complexities.
Towards this end, we develop an average-reward variant of the stochastic policy
mirror descent (SPMD) (Lan, 2022). We establish the first
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for solving AMDPs
with policy gradient method under both the generative model (with unichain
assumption) and Markovian noise model (with ergodic assumption). This bound can
be further improved to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ for solving
regularized AMDPs. Our theoretical advantages are corroborated by numerical
experiments.

evaluation of magnetic exchange coupling constants. In particular we analyze
the effect of scaling down the self-interaction-correction (SIC) for three {\em
non-empirical} density functional approximations (DFAs) namely, the local spin
density approximation, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient
approximation, and recent SCAN family of meta-GGA functionals. To this end, we
employ three one-electron SIC methods: Perdew-Zunger [Perdew, J. P.; Zunger, A.
\textit{Phys. Rev. B}, {\bf 1981}, \textit{23}, 5048] SIC, the orbitalwise
scaled SIC method [Vydrov, O. A. \textit{et al.}, \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf

R. \textit{et al.}, \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 2019}, \textit{151}, 214108].
We compute the magnetic exchange coupling constants using the spin projection
and non projection approaches for sets of molecules composed of dinuclear and
polynuclear H--He models, organic radical molecules, and chlorocuprate, and
compare these results against accurate theories and experiment. Our results
show that for the systems that mainly consist of single electron regions, PZSIC
performs well but for more complex organic systems and the chlorcuprates, an
overcorrecting tendency of PZSIC combined with the DFAs utilized in this work
is more pronounced, and in such cases LSIC with kinetic energy density ratio
performs better than PZSIC. Analysis of the results in terms of SIC corrections
to the density and to the total energy shows that both density and energy
correction are required to obtain an improved prediction of magnetic exchange
couplings.

density approximation (LDA). The version of LSIC that uses the iso-orbital
indicator $z$ as a scaling factor gives a more consistent improvement than an
alternative version that uses an orbital-dependent factor $w$ based on the
ratio of orbital densities to the total electron density. We show that LDA
energies evaluated using the self-consistent and self-interaction-free PZSIC
densities can be used to assess density-driven errors. The LDA reaction barrier
errors for the BH76 set are found to contain significant density-driven errors
for all types of reactions contained in the set, but the corrections due to
adding SIC to the functional are much larger than those stemming from the
density for the hydrogen transfer reactions and of roughly equal size for the
non-hydrogen transfer reactions.

finding signals of rare events and new physics in exabytes of data produced by
experiments at the high luminosity large hadron collider (LHC) require new
tools beyond just developments in hardware. Machine learning and artificial
intelligence offer the promise of dramatically reducing the computational cost

major impact, provides an overview of the challenges, and discusses how new
ideas such as normalizing flows can speed up the generation of gauge
configurations needed in lattice QCD calculations; the growth of ML in
surrogate models and pattern matching to reduce the cost of event generators

the landscape of string theories. While such approaches transform aspects of
particle theory into computational problems, and thus black boxes, we argue
that physics-aware development of these tools combined with algorithms that
ensure that the results are bias free will continue to require a deep
understanding of the physics. We see this broader transformation as akin to
formulating and extracting observables from simulations of lattice QCD, a
numerical integration of the path integral formulation of QCD that nevertheless
requires a deep understanding of the underlying quantum field theory, the
standard model of particle physics and effective field theory methods.

it tends to treats each frontal slice and each rank component of each frontal
slice equally. In order to get a recovery with high accuracy, we propose a
general and flexible rank relaxation function named double weighted nonconvex
nonsmooth rank (DWNNR) relaxation function for efficiently solving the third
order tensor recovery problem. The DWNNR relaxation function can be derived
from the triple nonconvex nonsmooth rank (TNNR) relaxation function by setting
the weight vector to be the hypergradient value of some concave function,
thereby adaptively selecting the weight vector. To accelerate the proposed
model, we develop the general inertial smoothing proximal gradient method.
Furthermore, we prove that any limit point of the generated subsequence is a
critical point. Combining the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property with some
milder assumptions, we further give its global convergence guarantee.

craters on Ryugu, by Sugita et al. (2019), is based on Hayabusa2 ONC images
obtained during the first month after the arrival of Hayabusa2 in June 2018.
Utilizing new images taken until February 2019, we constructed a global impact
crater catalogue of Ryugu, which includes all craters larger than 20 m in
diameter on the surface of Ryugu. As a result, we identified 77 craters on the
surface of Ryugu. Ryugu shows variation in crater density which cannot be
explained by the randomness of cratering; there are more craters at lower
latitudes and fewer at higher latitudes, and fewer craters in the western bulge
(160 E - 290 E) than in the region around the meridian (300 E - 30 E). This
variation implies a complicated geologic history for Ryugu. It seems that the
longitudinal variation in crater density simply indicates variation in the
crater ages; the cratered terrain around the meridian seems to be geologically
old while the western bulge is relatively young. The latitudinal variation in
crater density suggests that the equatorial ridge of Ryugu is a geologically
old structure; however, this could be alternatively explained by a collision
with many fission fragments during a short rotational period of Ryugu in the
past.

Based on the proposed taxonomy, it then introduces Sparseloop, the first fast,

models. Across representative accelerators and workloads, Sparseloop achieves
over 2000 times faster modeling speed than cycle-level simulations, maintains

Handling some changes may significantly impact the emotions of the
practitioners. Objective: We wanted to know the key challenges that make RC
handling difficult, how these impact the emotions of software practitioners,
what influences their RC handling, and how RC handling can be made less
emotionally challenging. Method: We followed a mixed-methods approach. We
conducted two survey studies, with 40 participants and 201 participants
respectively. The presentation of key quantitative data was followed by
descriptive statistical analysis, and the qualitative data was analysed using
Strauss-Corbinian Grounded Theory, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory analysis
techniques. Findings:We found (1) several key factors that make RC handling an
emotional challenge, (2) varying emotions that practitioners feel when it is
challenging to handle RCs, (3) how stakeholders, including practitioners
themselves, peers, managers and customers, influence the RC handling and how
practitioners feel due to the stakeholder influence, and (4) practices that can
be used to better handle RCs. Conclusion: Some challenges are technical and
some are social which also belong to aspects of agile practice, emotional
intelligence, and cognitive intelligence. Therefore, to better handle RCs with
positive emotions in socio-technical environments, agility, emotional
intelligence, and cognitive intelligence need to cooperate with each other.

Recently published CDFSML methods generally construct a ""universal model"" that

extractor. This enables efficient inference but necessitates re-computation of
the backbone whenever a new source domain is added. Moreover, these methods
often derive their universal model from a collection of backbones -- normally

incorporating addition optical transition peaks. In this study, we have further
developed a unique analyzing-energy search algorithm, in which a proper

(Delta M method) has been applied successfully to analyze perovskite-based
crystalline samples, including hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) and chalcogenide

four dimensional topological features. Here, we introduce a group field theory

fundamental task in machine learning, with applications in, e.g., graph
classification. The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy formulates a coupling
between the structured data based on optimal transportation, tackling the
incomparability between different structures by aligning the intra-relational
geometries. Although efficient \emph{local} solvers such as conditional
gradient and Sinkhorn are available, the inherent non-convexity still prevents
a tractable evaluation, and the existing lower bounds are not tight enough for
practical use. To address this issue, we take inspiration from the connection
with the quadratic assignment problem, and propose the orthogonal
Gromov-Wasserstein (OGW) discrepancy as a surrogate of GW. It admits an
efficient and \emph{closed-form} lower bound with $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$
complexity, and directly extends to the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW)
distance, incorporating node features into the coupling. Extensive experiments
on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show the tightness of our lower
bounds, and both OGW and its lower bounds efficiently deliver accurate
predictions and satisfactory barycenters for graph sets.

gapped edge states and localized corner states are obtained. By analyzing
atomic band representations, we demonstrate that its unconventional nature with
an essential band representation at an empty site, i.e., $A_g@4e$, is due to
the remarkable double-band inversion on Y-$\Gamma$. Then, we construct an

main challenge for this task is to achieve high-quality manual annotations on a
large amount of training data. To avoid reliance on such annotations, previous
works apply unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques by transferring
knowledge learned from easily accessible synthetic data to real-world datasets.
However, current state-of-the-art methods either rely on external data for
training an auxiliary task or apply an expensive coarse-to-fine estimation. In
this work, we aim to develop a new adversarial learning based method, which is
simple and efficient to apply. To reduce the domain gap between the synthetic
and real data, we design a bi-level alignment framework (BLA) consisting of (1)
task-driven data alignment and (2) fine-grained feature alignment. In contrast
to previous domain augmentation methods, we introduce AutoML to search for an
optimal transform on source, which well serves for the downstream task. On the
other hand, we do fine-grained alignment for foreground and background
separately to alleviate the alignment difficulty. We evaluate our approach on
five real-world crowd counting benchmarks, where we outperform existing
approaches by a large margin. Also, our approach is simple, easy to implement

polar receivers to phase noise and other nonlinearities. Yet, the
information-theoretic limits of polar receivers with finite-precision

of this work is to identify the optimal signaling strategy for the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with polar quantization at the output. More
precisely, we show that the capacity-achieving modulation scheme has an
amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) structure. Using this result, the capacity
of the AWGN channel with polar quantization at the output is established by
numerically optimizing the probability mass function of the amplitude. The
capacity of the polar-quantized AWGN channel with $b_1$-bit phase quantizer and

findings suggest the existence of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds, above

contaminated by severe and arbitrary fetal and maternal motion. Hence, stable
and robust motion correction is necessary to reconstruct high-resolution 3D
fetal brain volume for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis. However,
the conventional registration-based correction has a limited capture range and
is insufficient for detecting relatively large motions. Here, we present a
novel Affinity Fusion-based Framework for Iteratively Random Motion (AFFIRM)
correction of the multi-slice fetal brain MRI. It learns the sequential motion
from multiple stacks of slices and integrates the features between 2D slices
and reconstructed 3D volume using affinity fusion, which resembles the
iterations between slice-to-volume registration and volumetric reconstruction
in the regular pipeline. The method accurately estimates the motion regardless
of brain orientations and outperforms other state-of-the-art learning-based
methods on the simulated motion-corrupted data, with a 48.4% reduction of mean
absolute error for rotation and 61.3% for displacement. We then incorporated
AFFIRM into the multi-resolution slice-to-volume registration and tested it on
the real-world fetal MRI scans at different gestation stages. The results

Here, we report a combined theoretical and experimental study on the electronic
structure of the quasi-one-dimensional ternary telluride TaPtTe$_5$, which is
corroborated as being in a robust nodal-line phase with fourfold degeneracy.
Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that two pairs
of linearly dispersive Dirac-like bands exist in a very large energy window,
which extend from a binding energy of $\sim$ 0.75 eV to across the Fermi level.
The crossing points are at the boundary of Brillouin zone and form Dirac-like
nodal lines. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the existing
of nodal surfaces on the $k_y = \pm \pi$ plane in the absence of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), which are protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry in TaPtTe$_5$.
When SOC is included, the nodal surfaces are broken into several nodal lines.
By theoretical analysis, we conclude that the nodal lines along $Y$-$T$ and the
ones connecting the $R$ points are non-trivial and protected by nonsymmorphic
symmetry against SOC.

temporal region with motion queries. The entity-aware Transformer incorporates
the textual entities into visual representation learning via cross-modal and
cross-frame attentions to facilitate attending action-related video clips. The
motion-aware Transformer captures fine-grained motion changes at multiple
temporal scales via integrating long short-term memory into the self-attention

moving atmospheric pressures. In 1DH, three wave components can be identified:
the locked wave propagating with the speed of the atmospheric pressure, $C_p$,
and two free wave components propagating in opposite directions with the
respective wave celerity, according to the linear frequency dispersion
relationship. Under the supercritical condition ($C_p > C$, which is the
fastest celerity of the water wave) the leading water wave is the locked wave
and has the same sign (i.e., phase) as the atmospheric pressure, while the
trailing free wave has the opposite sign. Under the subcritical condition ($C
>C_p$) the fastest moving free wave component leads and its free surface
elevation has the same sign as the atmospheric pressure. For a long atmospheric
pressure disturbance, the induced free surface profile mimics that of the
atmospheric pressure. The 2DH problem involves an axisymmetric atmospheric
pressure decaying in the radial direction as $O(r^{-1/2})$. Only two wave
components, locked and free, appear due to symmetry.
  The tsunami DART data captured during Tonga's volcanic eruption event is
analyzed. Corrections are necessary to isolate the free surface elevation data.
Comparisons between the corrected DART data and the analytical solutions,

shift-stacking, increases the statistical significance of faint RSO signals

correction to each visibility to account for the curved wave-front. The method
was tested successfully on an MWA extended array observation of an ISS pass.
However, the method is currently limited by signal de-coherence on the
long-baselines (due to the hardware constraints of the current correlator). We

  Study Using Music Audio","The paper is accepted to IJCAI 2022",,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Disentangled sequential autoencoders (DSAEs) represent a class of
probabilistic graphical models that describes an observed sequence with dynamic
latent variables and a static latent variable. The former encode information at
a frame rate identical to the observation, while the latter globally governs
the entire sequence. This introduces an inductive bias and facilitates
unsupervised disentanglement of the underlying local and global factors. In
this paper, we show that the vanilla DSAE suffers from being sensitive to the
choice of model architecture and capacity of the dynamic latent variables, and
is prone to collapse the static latent variable. As a countermeasure, we
propose TS-DSAE, a two-stage training framework that first learns
sequence-level prior distributions, which are subsequently employed to
regularise the model and facilitate auxiliary objectives to promote
disentanglement. The proposed framework is fully unsupervised and robust
against the global factor collapse problem across a wide range of model
configurations. It also avoids typical solutions such as adversarial training
which usually involves laborious parameter tuning, and domain-specific data
augmentation. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to
demonstrate its robustness in terms of disentanglement on both artificial and
real-world music audio datasets.

perpendicular to a temperature gradient. Similar to the spin Hall effect, this

Green's functions. Our formalism predicts physically observable spin
accumulation without the ambiguity regarding the definition of the spin current

the electric and thermal responses assuming the presence of time-reversal

spin accumulation vanishes for the three-dimensional Luttinger model but is
nonzero for the two-dimensional Rashba model with $\delta$-function nonmagnetic

SoftMax activation, and the cross-entropy loss). Starting from the IsoMax+

than just the one associated with the correct class. We also introduce a
mechanism to combine images to construct what we call fractional probability
regularization. Moreover, we present a fast way to calibrate the network after

the Milky Way, one with the Small Magellanic Cloud, and another one with M31;
the rest have no or a dim optical counterpart ($\gtrsim 20$ mag), and are not

hypermassive neutron stars produced by merger of neutron stars, accreting
compact objects in the quiescent state, magnetars, and stellar flares.

associations between vascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities
(WMH) in men and women, separately. Methods: WMH were automatically segmented
and quantified in the UK Biobank dataset (N = 18,294). Generalised linear
models were applied to examine 1) the main effects of vascular (body mass
index, hip to waist ratio, pulse wave velocity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes,
hypertension, smoking status) and hormonal (testosterone levels, contraceptive
pill, hormone replacement therapy, menopause) factors on WMH, and 2) the
moderation effects of hormonal factors on the relationship between vascular
risk factors and WMH volumes. Results: In men with testosterone levels one
standard deviation (SD) higher than the mean value, increased body mass index
and pulse wave velocity, and smoking were associated with higher WMH volumes.
The association between body mass index and WMH was more significant in the
periventricular white matter regions, whilst the relationship between pulse
wave velocity and WMH was restricted to deep white matter regions. Men with low
testosterone levels (one SD below the mean level) showed a significant
association between hypercholesterolemia and higher deep WMH volumes.
Hypertensive women showed higher WMH volumes than women without hypertension
regardless of whether hormone replacement therapy was used. However, higher WMH
volumes, especially in the deep white matter regions, were found in women who
did not use hormone replacement therapy or use it for a shorter duration.
Conclusion: These findings highlighted the importance of considering hormonal
risk factors in the prevention and management of WMH.

image quality without any pristine reference information, has been extensively
concerned in the past decades. Especially, with the help of deep neural
networks, great progress has been achieved. However, it remains less
investigated on BIQA for night-time images (NTIs) which usually suffers from
complicated authentic distortions such as reduced visibility, low contrast,
additive noises, and color distortions. These diverse authentic degradations
particularly challenges the design of effective deep neural network for blind
NTI quality evaluation (NTIQE). In this paper, we propose a novel deep
decomposition and bilinear pooling network (DDB-Net) to better address this
issue. The DDB-Net contains three modules, i.e., an image decomposition module,
a feature encoding module, and a bilinear pooling module. The image
decomposition module is inspired by the Retinex theory and involves decoupling
the input NTI into an illumination layer component responsible for illumination
information and a reflection layer component responsible for content
information. Then, the feature encoding module involves learning feature
representations of degradations that are rooted in the two decoupled components
separately. Finally, by modeling illumination-related and content-related
degradations as two-factor variations, the two feature sets are bilinearly
pooled together to form a unified representation for quality prediction. The
superiority of the proposed DDB-Net has been well validated by extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets. The source code will be made
available soon.

the query representation for a second round of retrieval. This assumption
however is often not correct: some or even all of the feedback documents may be
irrelevant. Indeed, the effectiveness of PRF methods may well depend on the
quality of the feedback signal and thus on the effectiveness of the first-stage
ranker. This aspect however has received little attention before.
  In this paper we control the quality of the feedback signal and measure its
impact on a range of PRF methods, including traditional bag-of-words methods
(Rocchio), and dense vector-based methods (learnt and not learnt). Our results
show the important role the quality of the feedback signal plays on the
effectiveness of PRF methods. Importantly, and surprisingly, our analysis
reveals that not all PRF methods are the same when dealing with feedback
signals of varying quality. These findings are critical to gain a better

universe cosmological probes, Effective Field Theories of Large Scale Structure
(EFTofLSS) have emerged as a promising new framework to generate constraints on
$\Omega_k$ that are independent of both CMB measurements, and some of the
assumptions of flatness that enter into other large-scale structure analyses.
In this work we use EFTofLSS to simultaneously constrain measurements from the
6dFGS, BOSS, and eBOSS catalogues, representing the most expansive full-shape
investigation of curvature to date. Fitting the full-shape data with a BBN
prior on $\Omega_b h^2$ and fixed $n_s$, we measure $\Omega_k =
-0.089^{+0.049}_{-0.046}$, corresponding to a $\sim 2 \sigma$ preference for
curvature. We argue that this result cannot be biased towards flatness by
assumptions in the fitting methodology. Using the Bayesian evidence ratio our
full-shape data assigns betting odds of 2:1 in favour of curvature, indicating
present measurements remain broadly compatible with both flat and curved
cosmological models. When our full-shape sample is combined with Planck 2018
CMB measurements, we break the geometric degeneracy and recover a joint fit on
$\Omega_k$ of $-0.0041^{+0.0026}_{-0.0021}$. Using the suspiciousness statistic
(built on the standard Bayes factor), we find evidence for a moderate tension
between Planck 2018 and our suite of full-shape measurements, at a significance
of $1.76 ^{+0.14}_{-0.11} \sigma$ ($p \sim 0.08 \pm 0.02$). These results
demonstrate the usefulness of full-shape clustering measurements as a CMB
independent probe of curvature in the ongoing curvature tension debate.

optimal control is designed and then applied to an actual (true) system. This
gives rise to the problem of performance loss due to the mismatch between the
true model and the assumed model. A robustness problem in this context is to
show that the error due to the mismatch between a true model and an assumed
model decreases to zero as the assumed model approaches the true model. We
study this problem when the state dynamics of the system are governed by
controlled diffusion processes. In particular, we will discuss continuity and
robustness properties of infinite-horizon $\alpha$-discounted/ergodic optimal
control problems for a general class of non-degenerate controlled diffusion
processes, as well as for optimal control up to an exit time. Under a general
set of assumptions and a convergence criterion on the models, we first
establish that the optimal value of the approximate model converges to the
optimal value of the true model. We then establish that the error due to
mismatch that occurs by application of a control policy, designed for an
incorrectly estimated model, to a true model decreases to zero as the incorrect
model approaches the true model. We will see that, compared to related results
in the discrete-time setup, the continuous-time theory will let us utilize the
strong regularity properties of solutions to optimality (HJB) equations, via
the theory of uniformly elliptic PDEs, to arrive at strong continuity and
robustness properties.

research is being done in English to quantify and mitigate bias, debiasing

consequence, evaluation differs from what is done in English. This paper
evaluates the gender stereotypes in Hindi and Marathi languages. The
methodologies will differ from the ones in the English language because there
are masculine and feminine counterparts in the case of some words. We create a

Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and evaluated for an independent

new clues about the properties of plasma populations in the solar wind, and,
especially, about their variations with heliographic coordinates. We revisit
the electron data reported by by the SWOOPS instrument on-board of the Ulysses
spacecraft between 1990 to early 2008. These observations reveal velocity
distributions out of thermal equilibrium, with anisotropies (e.g., parallel
drifts or/and different temperatures, parallel and perpendicular to the
background magnetic field), and quasi-thermal and suprathermal populations with
different properties. We apply a 2D nonlinear least square fitting procedure,
using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, to simultaneously fit the velocity
electron data (up to a few keV) with a triple model combining three distinct
populations: the more central quasi-thermal core and suprathermal halo, and a
second suprathermal population consisting mainly of the electron strahl (or
beaming population with a major field-aligned drift). The recently introduced
$\kappa$-cookbook is used to describe each component with the following
anisotropic distribution functions (recipes): Maxwellian, regularized kappa-,
and generalized kappa-distributions. The temperature anisotropy quantified by
the best fits is considered as a case study of the main parameters
characterizing electron populations. By comparison to the core, both
suprathermal populations exhibit higher temperature anisotropies, which
slightly increase with the energy of electrons.

Experiments demonstrate that Facade R-CNN achieves better performance than the
current state-of-the-art facade parsing models, which are primarily developed
for frontal views. We also publish a new building facade parsing dataset

preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of two-phase flow and transport in
heterogeneous porous media. We propose a field-split algorithm named
Field-Split Multiplicative Schwarz Newton (FSMSN), consisting in two steps:
first, we apply a preconditioning step to update pressure and saturations
nonlinearly by solving approximately two subproblems in a sequential fashion;
then, we apply a global step relying on a Newton update obtained by linearizing
the system at the preconditioned state. Using challenging test cases, FSMSN is
compared to an existing field-split preconditioner, Multiplicative Schwarz
Preconditioned for Inexact Newton (MSPIN), and to standard solution strategies
such as the Sequential Fully Implicit (SFI) method or the Fully Implicit Method
(FIM). The comparison highlights the impact of the upwinding scheme in the
algorithmic performance of the preconditioners and the importance of the
dynamic adaptation of the subproblem tolerance in the preconditioning step. Our
results demonstrate that the two-step nonlinear preconditioning approach-and in
particular, FSMSN-results in a faster outer-loop convergence than with the SFI
and FIM methods. The impact of the preconditioners on computational
performance-i.e., measured by wall-clock time-will be studied in a subsequent
publication.

nonlinearities and various forms of topologies, two kinds of state observers
involving standard observer and distributed pinning observer are presented for
each regarded nonlinear agent by applying a novel analysis directly dealing
with the nonlinear input and nonlinear system dynamics. The measured local
output detail outlines the first observer, and the other observer is achieved
via the corresponding output detail of its adjacent agents. Based on further
observed state details, a distributed pinning observer-based strategy is
derived for the leader-follower non-negative global consensus of the nonlinear
positive multi-agent system. Additionally, two multi-step algorithms are
proposed to set up the observer gains and each protocol criterion. Performance
evaluations are provided to confirm the proposed control method and illustrate
the effectiveness of the derived non-negative consensus observer-based

always exhibit inextricable link due to the symmetry in electromagnetism. At
the interface, polar groups that have polar charges, are indispensable to be
considered, which interact directly with other polar charges/external
charges/external electric fields. However, there is no report on the
corresponding magnetic properties on these polar groups. Clearly, such
asymmetry, that is, only the interaction between the polar groups and charges,
is out of bounds. Here we show that those molecules with considerable polar
groups, such as cellulose acetate (CA) and other cellulose derivatives with
different polar groups, can have strong magnetic response, indicating that they
are strongly paramagnetic. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows
that the polarity greatly reduces the excitation energy from the state without
net spin (singlet) to the state with net spin (triplet), making the
considerable existence of magnetic moments on the polar groups. We note that
the hydrophobic groups in these molecules have no magnetic moments, however,
they make the molecules aggregate to amply the magnetic effect of the magnetic
moments in the polar groups, so that these magnetic moments can induce the
strong paramagnetism. Our observations suggest a recovery of the symmetry with
inextricable link between the electricity and magnetism at the interface. The
findings leave many imaginations of the role of the magnetic interaction in
biological systems as well as other magnetic applications considering that many
of those polar materials are biological materials, pharmaceutical materials,
chemical raw materials, and even an essential hormone in agricultural
production.

(WSSOD-P), where the training data is combined by a small set of fully
annotated images with bounding boxes and a large set of weakly-labeled images
with only a single point annotated for each instance. The core of this task is
to train a point-to-box regressor on well-labeled images that can be used to
predict credible bounding boxes for each point annotation. We challenge the
prior belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not compatible with this
task. Based on the classic R-CNN architecture, we propose an effective
point-to-box regressor: Group R-CNN. Group R-CNN first uses instance-level
proposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation
and thus can obtain a high recall rate. To better distinguish different
instances and improve precision, we propose instance-level proposal assignment
to replace the vanilla assignment strategy adopted in the original R-CNN
methods. As naive instance-level assignment brings converging difficulty, we
propose instance-aware representation learning which consists of instance-aware
feature enhancement and instance-aware parameter generation to overcome this
issue. Comprehensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Specifically, Group R-CNN significantly
outperforms the prior method Point DETR by 3.9 mAP with 5% well-labeled images,
which is the most challenging scenario. The source code can be found at

representing scenes and synthesizing photo-realistic images. A main limitation
of conventional NeRFs is that they often fail to produce high-quality
renderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the
training viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image
synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training
images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy
between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF
(RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a
3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus
propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using
seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the
observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality
for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the
strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency
property.

capacity in wireless devices while at the same time user throughput
requirements are relentlessly increasing. In this paper, we study an energy
efficient cooperation scheme which employs network coding to enhance the energy
efficiency for mobile devices. Herein we propose that the mobile devices are
clustered into mobile small cells with one of the mobile devices acting as a
group head with basic transceiver, coding and relaying functionalities. Group
heads coordinate the transmissions from the mobile devices in the mobile small
cell to the network's base stations. The objective function of the cooperative
scheme is to minimize mobile devices' energy consumption subject to a certain
bit error probability. The proposed network-coding based scheme has been
evaluated by means of numerical simulations and compared to both a conventional
direct transmit scheme, with no cooperation groups, and a cooperative relaying
scheme. Results show that, with network-coded cooperation, energy efficiency
may significantly increase provided the density of base stations and mobile
devices is below a certain value. Above this value none of the compared
cooperation schemes may improve energy efficiency, but rather power consumption
is reduced only when mobile devices transmit via base stations in their close
proximity.

  Functioning: An Application to Political Representation in the US",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A common approach when studying the quality of representation involves
comparing the latent preferences of voters and legislators, commonly obtained
by fitting an item-response theory (IRT) model to a common set of stimuli.
Despite being exposed to the same stimuli, voters and legislators may not share
a common understanding of how these stimuli map onto their latent preferences,
leading to differential item-functioning (DIF) and incomparability of
estimates. We explore the presence of DIF and incomparability of latent
preferences obtained through IRT models by re-analyzing an influential survey
data set, where survey respondents expressed their preferences on roll call
votes that U.S. legislators had previously voted on. To do so, we propose
defining a Dirichlet Process prior over item-response functions in standard IRT
models. In contrast to typical multi-step approaches to detecting DIF, our
strategy allows researchers to fit a single model, automatically identifying
incomparable sub-groups with different mappings from latent traits onto
observed responses. We find that although there is a group of voters whose
estimated positions can be safely compared to those of legislators, a sizeable
share of surveyed voters understand stimuli in fundamentally different ways.
Ignoring these issues can lead to incorrect conclusions about the quality of
representation.

stronger one. Existing methods usually rely on a co-association (CA) matrix
that measures how many times two samples are grouped into the same cluster
according to the base clusterings to achieve ensemble clustering. However, when
the constructed CA matrix is of low quality, the performance will degrade. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective CA matrix self-enhancement
framework that can improve the CA matrix to achieve better clustering

propagating the highly-reliable information of the HC matrix to the CA matrix
and complementing the HC matrix according to the CA matrix simultaneously, the
proposed method generates an enhanced CA matrix for better clustering.
Technically, the proposed model is formulated as a symmetric constrained convex
optimization problem, which is efficiently solved by an alternating iterative
algorithm with convergence and global optimum theoretically guaranteed.

a revision of the QoE evaluation methods designed for previous technologies is
required to develop robust and reliable methodologies for immersive
communication systems. Thus, the objective of this paper is to provide an
overview of existing immersive communication systems and related user studies,
which can help on the definition of basic guidelines and testing methodologies
to be used when performing user tests of immersive communication systems, such

topic in drug development and precision medicine. Currently, computational

addition, existing methods either heavily rely on high-quality domain features

Communicative Subgraph representation learning for Multi-relational Inductive

for unseen drugs/genes without retraining or utilizing external domain

through a communicative message passing mechanism. To evaluate our method, we
compiled two new benchmark datasets from DrugBank and DGIdb. The comprehensive

evaluation at any tuple of operators in a tracial von Neumann algebra has
nonnegative trace. Such polynomials emerge as trace inequalities in several
matrix or operator variables, and are widespread in mathematics and physics.
This paper delivers the first Positivstellensatz for global trace positivity of
nc polynomials. Analogously to Hilbert's 17th problem in real algebraic
geometry, trace-positive nc polynomials are shown to be weakly sums of
hermitian squares and commutators of regular nc rational functions. In two
variables, this result is strengthened further using a new sum-of-squares
certificate with concrete univariate denominators for nonnegative bivariate
polynomials.
  The trace positivity certificates in this paper are obtained by convex
duality through solving the so-called unbounded tracial moment problem, which
arises from noncommutative integration theory and free probability. Given a
linear functional on nc polynomials, the tracial moment problem asks whether it
is a joint distribution of integral operators affiliated with a tracial von
Neumann algebra. A counterpart to Haviland's theorem on solvability of the
tracial moment problem is established. Moreover, a variant of Carleman's
condition is shown to guarantee the existence of a solution to the tracial
moment problem. Together with semidefinite optimization, this is then used to
prove that every trace-positive nc polynomial admits an explicit approximation
in the 1-norm on its coefficients by sums of hermitian squares and commutators
of nc polynomials.

Conventionally, while transferring the knowledge learned from one task to
another task, the deeper layers of a pre-trained CNN are finetuned over the
target dataset. However, these layers that are originally designed for the
source task are over-parameterized for the target task. Thus, finetuning these
layers over the target dataset reduces the generalization ability of the CNN
due to high network complexity. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage
framework called TASCNet which enables efficient knowledge transfer. In the
first stage, the configuration of the deeper layers is learned automatically
and finetuned over the target dataset. Later, in the second stage, the
redundant filters are pruned from the fine-tuned CNN to decrease the network's
complexity for the target task while preserving the performance. This two-stage
mechanism finds a compact version of the pre-trained CNN with optimal structure
(number of filters in a convolutional layer, number of neurons in a dense

Using the fragment ($Z\geq10$) multiplicity equal to 2, fission and
quasi-fission events were studied for the lowest beam energies using the
fission fragment charge distributions, the total kinetic energy distribution
(TKE) and its standard deviation $\sigma_{TKE}$. For the lighter system it is
still possible to observe fission events from incomplete fusion. At variance,
for the heavier system, Xenon on gold target only quasi-fission is evidenced.
The study of the events characterized by two fragments in the final channel
shows that fission, related to fusion in the entrance channel, disappears
around 20A MeV for both systems. At lower energies (8A, 12A and 15A MeV) for
the Sn target, an evolution with increasing energies towards an asymmetric
fission mode is displayed in the fragment charge distributions. This trend can
be attributed to the increasing angular momentum as indicated by the
out-of-plane angular distribution for light charged particles. The same effect
is also observed in the case of the gold target at 15A MeV. However, for this
heavier system, a strong memory of the entrance channel leading to
quasi-fission is evidenced. A comparison with the Viola systematics, moreover,

transiting white dwarfs analogous to hot Jupiters. We used various noise models
to account for the systematic noise in their spectroscopic light curves
following common procedures of transmission spectroscopy analyses. We compared
the derived transmission spectra with the broadband transit depth to determine
whether there are any artificial offsets or spectral features arising from
light-curve fitting. The results show a strong model dependence, and the
transmission spectra exhibit considerable discrepancies when they are computed
with different noise models, different reference stars, and different
common-mode removal methods. Nonetheless, we can still derive relatively
accurate transmission spectra based on a Bayesian model comparison. With
current ground-based instrumentation, the systematics in transit light curves
can easily contaminate a transmission spectrum, introducing a general offset or
some spurious spectral features and thus leading to a biased interpretation on
the planetary atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the
dependence of results on the adopted noise model through model comparison. The

(1-x)Ba(Ti$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$)O$_3$-x(Ba$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$)TiO$_3$ (BZT-BCT)
ceramics are promising materials due to their remarkable high piezoresponse
[Liu and Ren, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{103}, 257602 (2009)]. In this Letter, by
focusing on local and average structure in combination with macroscopic
electromechanical and dielectric measurements we demonstrate the structure
property relationship in the tetragonal BZT-BCT ceramic. During
high-temperature cubic to tetragonal phase transformation, polar nanoregions
are manifested through the spontaneous volume ferroelectrostriction at
temperatures below $\sim$ 477 K. Temperature-dependent local structural
investigations across the Zr K edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure
spectroscopy reveal an anomalous collaboration between the ZrO$_{6}$ and
TiO$_6$ octahedra. These octahedra compromise their individuality during
polarization development. The presence of domains of submicron size embedded
inside the macroscopic ferroelectric regions below T$_{m}$, as well as their
hierarchical arrangement, is observed by piezo-response force microscopy.
Effects of the existence of the structural/polar heterogeneities below T$_{m}$
are observed also when polarizibilities of the poled and the unpoled samples
are compared; the poled sample is found to be more susceptible to the electric
field. In addition, by using electric field dependent x-ray diffraction studies
we also show that this ceramic under field exhibits reduction of tetragonal
distortion, which is consistent with earlier reports.

and preprocessing, as well as failure awareness through introspection, for
example the ability to self-assess localization performance. This paper
presents CorAl: a principled, intuitive, and generalizable method to measure
the quality of alignment between pairs of point clouds, which learns to detect
alignment errors in a self-supervised manner. CorAl compares the differential
entropy in the point clouds separately with the entropy in their union to
account for entropy inherent to the scene. By making use of dual entropy
measurements, we obtain a quality metric that is highly sensitive to small
alignment errors and still generalizes well to unseen environments. In this
work, we extend our previous work on lidar-only CorAl to radar data by
proposing a two-stage filtering technique that produces high-quality point
clouds from noisy radar scans. Thus we target robust perception in two ways: by
introducing a method that introspectively assesses alignment quality, and
applying it to an inherently robust sensor modality. We show that our filtering
technique combined with CorAl can be applied to the problem of alignment
classification, and that it detects small alignment errors in urban settings
with up to 98% accuracy, and with up to 96% if trained only in a different
environment. Our lidar and radar experiments demonstrate that CorAl outperforms
previous methods both on the ETH lidar benchmark, which includes several indoor
and outdoor environments, and the large-scale Oxford and MulRan radar data sets
for urban traffic scenarios The results also demonstrate that CorAl generalizes
very well across substantially different environments without the need of

(MDLSITE from moodle.org and FLUME from apache.org) to find the best features
in 28 combinations of features and the best performance model using two

baseline models using traditional methods: TF-IDF with various matching score
calculating such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance,

model reached the best result in our dataset, so we chose this model as our

considered: Fe insertion in the $2 \times 2$ tunnels and partial substitution
of Fe for Mn. We find that the interstitial doping preserves the C2-AFM spin
configuration of the host lattice only when both onsite $U$ and intersite $V$

onsite Hubbard $U$ correction alone is able to preserve the C2-AFM spin

  under uncertainty","18 pages, 10 figures",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In transmission expansion planning, situations can arise in which an
expansion plan that is optimal for the system as a whole is detrimental to a
specific country in terms of its expected economic welfare. If this country is
one of the countries hosting the planned capacity expansion, it has the power
to veto the plan and thus, undermine the system-wide social optimum. To solve
this issue, welfare compensation mechanisms may be constructed that compensate
suffering countries and make them willing to participate in the expansion plan.
In the literature, welfare compensation mechanisms have been developed that
work in expectation. However, in a stochastic setting, even if the welfare
effect after compensation is positive in expectation, countries might still be
hesitant to accept the risk that the actual, realized welfare effect may be
negative in some scenarios.
  In this paper we analyze welfare compensation mechanisms in a stochastic
setting. We consider two existing mechanisms, lump-sum payments and purchase
power agreements, and we develop two novel mechanisms, based on the flow
through the new transmission line and its economic value. Using a case study of
the Northern European power market, we investigate how well these mechanisms
succeed in mitigating risk for the countries involved. Using a theoretically
ideal model-based mechanism, we show that there is a significant potential for
mitigating risk through welfare compensation mechanisms. Out of the four
practical mechanisms we consider, our results indicate that a mechanism based
on the economic value of the new transmission line is most promising.

unsupervised adversarial 2D to 3D human pose estimation. In our work we
demonstrate that the human kinematic skeleton should not be assumed as a single
spatially codependent structure; in fact, we posit when a full 2D pose is
provided during training, there is an inherent bias learned where the 3D
coordinate of a keypoint is spatially codependent on the 2D coordinates of all
other keypoints. To investigate our hypothesis we follow previous adversarial
approaches but train two generators on spatially independent parts of the
kinematic skeleton, the torso and the legs. We find that improving the
self-consistency cycle is key to lowering the evaluation error and therefore
introduce new consistency constraints during training. A TIPSy model is
produced via knowledge distillation from these generators which can predict the
3D ordinates for the entire 2D pose with improved results. Furthermore, we
address an unanswered question in prior work of how long to train in a truly
unsupervised scenario. We show that for two independent generators training
adversarially has improved stability than that of a solo generator which
collapses. TIPSy decreases the average error by 17\% when compared to that of a
baseline solo generator on the Human3.6M dataset. TIPSy improves upon other
unsupervised approaches while also performing strongly against supervised and
weakly-supervised approaches during evaluation on both the Human3.6M and

we leverage the sequential nature of states in a replay buffer to approximate a

we use a simple and general GNN architecture and aim at obtaining crisp
experimental results and a deeper understanding: either the policy greedy in
the learned value function achieves close to 100% generalization over instances
larger than those used in training, or the failure must be understood, and
possibly fixed, logically. For this, we exploit the relation established
between the expressive power of GNNs and the $C_{2}$ fragment of first-order
logic (namely, FOL with 2 variables and counting quantifiers). We find for
example that domains with general policies that require more expressive
features can be solved with GNNs once the states are extended with suitable
""derived atoms"" encoding role compositions and transitive closures that do not
fit into $C_{2}$. The work follows the GNN approach for learning optimal
general policies in a supervised fashion (Stahlberg, Bonet, Geffner, 2022); but
the learned policies are no longer required to be optimal (which expands the
scope, as many planning domains do not have general optimal policies) and are
learned without supervision. Interestingly, value-based reinforcement learning
methods that aim to produce optimal policies, do not always yield policies that
generalize, as the goals of optimality and generality are in conflict in
domains where optimal planning is NP-hard.

intermediate region ($200\leq M_{DM}\leq 550$ GeV) and also generate light
Dirac neutrino masses. In this framework, the standard model is extended by
three gauge singlet fermions, two singlet scalar fields, and one additional
scalar doublet, all of which are odd under $Z_{2} \times Z_{4}$ discrete
symmetry. These additional symmetries prevent the singlet fermions from
obtaining Majorana mass terms along with providing the stability to the dark
matter candidate. It is known that in the case of the scalar singlet DM model,
the only region which is not yet excluded is a narrow region close to the Higgs
resonance $m_{S} \simeq\frac{m_{h}}{2}$ - others ruled out from different
experimental and theoretical bounds. In the case of the Inert doublet model,
the mass region ($\sim 60$-$80$ GeV) and the high mass region (heavier than $
550 $ GeV) are allowed. This motivates us to explore a parameter range in the
intermediate-mass region $M_{W}\leq M_{DM}\leq 550 $ GeV, which we do in a
scotogenic extension of SM with a scalar doublet and scalar singlets. The dark
matter in our model is a mixture of singlet and doublet scalars. We constrain
the allowed parameter space of the model using Planck bound on present dark
matter relic abundance, neutrino mass, and the latest bound on spin-independent
DM-nucleon scattering cross-section from XENON1T experiment. Our model may
provide a viable DM candidate in the new, previously unexplored mass range
($200\leq M_{DM}\leq 550$ GeV), if this new window for the DM candidate mass is
detected in future experiments, along with explanation of Dirac mass of
neutrinos, since so far there is no strong evidence in support of Majorana

this article, exploiting the distributed structure of the problem, we propose a
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to optimize user throughput
via flow routing and link scheduling in mmWave IAB networks characterized by
user mobility and link outages generated by moving obstacles. The proposed
approach implicitly captures the environment dynamics, coordinates the
interference, and manages the buffer levels of IAB relay nodes. We design
different MARL components, considering full-duplex and half-duplex IAB-nodes.
In addition, we provide a communication and coordination scheme for RL agents
in an online training framework, addressing the feasibility issues of practical
systems. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

networked systems, where individual entities interact in pairs, anomalies are
observed when pattern of interactions deviates from patterns considered
regular. Properly defining what regular patterns entail relies on developing
expressive models for describing the observed interactions. It is crucial to
address anomaly detection in networks. Among the many well-known models for
networks, latent variable models - a class of probabilistic models - offer
promising tools to capture the intrinsic features of the data. In this work, we
propose a probabilistic generative approach that incorporates domain knowledge,
i.e., community membership, as a fundamental model for regular behavior, and
thus flags potential anomalies deviating from this pattern. In fact, community
membership serves as the building block of a null model to identify the regular
interaction patterns. The structural information is included in the model
through latent variables for community membership and anomaly parameter. The
algorithm aims at inferring these latent parameters and then output the labels
identifying anomalies on the network edges.

  for log-normality",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sea ice is not continuous and homogeneous on large scales. Its morphology is
inherently discrete and made of individual floes. In recent years, sea ice
models have incorporated this horizontal heterogeneity. The modelling framework
considers an evolution equation for the probability density function of the
floe size distribution (FSD) with forcing terms that represent the effects of
several physical processes. Despite the modelling effort, a key question
remains: what is the FSD emerging from the collection of all forcing processes?
Field observations have long suggested the FSD follows a power law, but this
result has not been reproduced by models or laboratory experiments. The
theoretical framework for FSD dynamics in response to physical forcings is
presented. Wave-induced breakup is further examined with an emphasis on how it
affects the FSD. Recent modelling results suggesting the consistent emergence
of a lognormal distribution as a result of that process are further discussed.
Log-normality is also found in a dataset of floe sizes, which was originally
analysed under the power law hypothesis. We then propose a simple stochastic
process of FSD dynamics, based on random fragmentation theory, that predicts
log-normality. We therefore conjecture that the emergent FSD follows a
lognormal distribution.

queueing delay costs. Next, for an arbitrary feasible solution to the MPCC, we
prove the existence of another feasible solution where the departure flow

the tidal phase and an increase in the tidal post-Newtonian order does not lead
to a monotonic change in the estimate of $\tilde{\Lambda}$. We also compare the
estimate of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ obtained by the post-Newtonian tidal model and
numerical-relativity calibrated tidal models. We find that the post-Newtonian

using the mutual information and the relative entropy. They differ in
appearance, and existing methods to prove their agreement are not elementary,
as they require an evaluation of the KKT conditions that the optimal
distribution must satisfy. Similarly, there are two types of expressions for
the strong converse exponent. They are Arimoto's expression with a negative
slope parameter and Dueck and Korner's information-theoretic expression. The
purpose of this paper is to clarify the relation between two ways of
representing exponents, i.e., representations using slope parameters and those
using information-theoretic quantities, from the viewpoint of algorithms for
computing exponents. Arimoto's algorithm is based on expression using slope
parameters, while the authors' and Tridenski and Zamir's algorithms are based
on Dueck and Korner's information-theoretic expression. An algorithm family
that includes the above two algorithms as special cases was recently proposed.
This paper clarifies that the convergence of Tridenski and Zamir's algorithm
proves the match of Arimoto's and Dueck and Korner's exponents. We discuss
another family of algorithms and, using the surrogate objective function used
therein, prove that the two expressions of the error exponent coincide.
Evaluation of the KKT condition is not needed in this proof. We then discuss
the computation of the error and correct decoding probability exponents in
lossy source coding. A new algorithm family for computing the source coding
strong converse exponent is defined. The convergence of a member of the
algorithm family implies the match of the two expressions of the strong
converse exponent.

understand how societal narratives develop. These dynamics can be modelled
through a combination of information-theoretic natural language processing and

However, it is challenging to see ""the wood for the trees"", i.e., to detect
small but important flows of information in a sea of noise. Here we develop new
comparative techniques to estimate temporal information flow between pairs of
text producers. Using both simulated and real text data we compare the
reliability and sensitivity of methods for estimating textual information flow,
showing that a metric that normalises by local neighbourhood structure provides
a robust estimate of information flow in large networks. We apply this metric
to a large corpus of news organisations on Twitter and demonstrate its
usefulness in identifying influence within an information ecosystem, finding
that average information contribution to the network is not correlated with the
number of followers or the number of tweets. This suggests that small local
organisations and right-wing organisations which have lower average follower
counts still contribute significant information to the ecosystem. Further, the
methods are applied to smaller full-text datasets of specific news events

  Generation",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an important and challenging problem, few-shot image generation aims at
generating realistic images through training a GAN model given few samples. A
typical solution for few-shot generation is to transfer a well-trained GAN
model from a data-rich source domain to the data-deficient target domain. In
this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer scheme termed D3T-GAN,
addressing the cross-domain GANs transfer in few-shot image generation.
Specifically, we design two individual strategies to transfer knowledge between
generators and discriminators, respectively. To transfer knowledge between
generators, we conduct a data-dependent transformation, which projects and
reconstructs the target samples into the source generator space. Then, we
perform knowledge transfer from transformed samples to generated samples. To
transfer knowledge between discriminators, we design a multi-level discriminant
knowledge distillation from the source discriminator to the target
discriminator on both the real and fake samples. Extensive experiments show
that our method improve the quality of generated images and achieves the
state-of-the-art FID scores on commonly used datasets.

bound in the case t=1. To prove these inequalities, our methods involve
constructing injective maps between the relevant sets of partitions. The
construction of these maps crucially involves concepts from analysis and
calculus, such as explicit maps used to prove countability of N^t, and Jensen's
inequality for convex functions, and then merge them with techniques from
number theory such as Frobenius numbers, congruence classes, binary numbers and
quadratic residues. We also show a connection of our results to colored

most stringent test is based on a severely truncated virtual space in which
higher spherical harmonic basis functions are removed. The errors of the

corrections brings calculated CI energies into agreement with experimental

find that the magnetic field in the periphery of the globule shows significant,
ordered deviation from the mean field direction in the globule centre. This
deviation appears to correspond with the extended but relatively weak $^{12}$CO
outflow emanating from the Class 0 sources at the centre of the globule.
Energetics analysis suggests that if the outflow is reshaping the magnetic
field in the globule's periphery, then we can place an upper limit of
$<27\,\mu$G on the magnetic field strength in the globule's periphery.
Comparison with archival Planck and CARMA measurements shows that the field in
the centre of the globule is consistent over several orders of magnitude in
size scale, and oriented parallel to the density structure in the region in
projection. We thus hypothesise that while non-thermal motions in the region
may be sub-Alfv\'enic, the magnetic field is subdominant to gravity over a wide
range of size scales. Our results suggest that even a relatively weak outflow
may be able to significantly reshape magnetic fields in star-forming regions on

densities in the two junction leads, or are largely confined to the lower-gap

applications in robotics. However, high-density LiDAR sensors are usually
costly and still limited to a level of coverage per scan (e.g., 128 channels).
Meanwhile, denser point cloud scans and maps mean larger volumes to store and
longer times to transmit. Existing works focus on either improving point cloud
density or compressing its size. This paper aims to design a novel 3D point
cloud representation that can continuously increase point cloud density while
reducing its storage and transmitting size. The pipeline of the proposed
Continuous, Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) includes four main
steps: meshing, upsampling, encoding, and continuous reconstruction. It is
capable of transforming a 3D LiDAR scan or map into a compact spherical
harmonics representation which can be used or transmitted in low latency to
continuously reconstruct a much denser 3D point cloud. Extensive experiments on
four public datasets, covering college gardens, city streets, and indoor rooms,
demonstrate that much denser 3D point clouds can be accurately reconstructed
using the proposed CURL representation while achieving up to 80% storage
space-saving. We open-source the CURL codes for the community.

property in RPKI that allows our attacks is the tradeoff between connectivity

points, they make routing decisions in BGP without validating RPKI. We exploit
this tradeoff to develop attacks that prevent the retrieval of the RPKI objects
from the public repositories, thereby disabling RPKI validation and exposing
the RPKI-protected networks to prefix hijack attacks.
  We demonstrate experimentally that at least 47% of the public repositories
are vulnerable against a specific version of our attacks, a rate-limiting
off-path downgrade attack. We also show that all the current RPKI relying party
implementations are vulnerable to attacks by a malicious publication point.
This translates to 20.4% of the IPv4 address space.
  We provide recommendations for preventing our downgrade attacks. However,
resolving the fundamental problem is not straightforward: if the relying
parties prefer security over connectivity and insist on RPKI validation when
ROAs cannot be retrieved, the victim AS may become disconnected from many more
networks than just the one that the adversary wishes to hijack. Our work shows
that the publication points are a critical infrastructure for Internet
connectivity and security. Our main recommendation is therefore that the
publication points should be hosted on robust platforms guaranteeing a high
degree of connectivity.

sharp turns, and therefore strong non-geodesic trajectories, from transient
violations of slow-roll without the requirement of large field space curvatures
in supergravity inflation. Such turning rates can strongly source the adiabatic
fluctuations, resulting in an enhanced scalar power spectrum with resonant
features and a large peak amplitude. If the growth of the scalar power spectrum
at small scales is large enough, primordial black holes can be produced in
abundance. These large scalar fluctuations induce a characteristic large
spectrum of gravitational waves for a wide range of frequencies, which inherits
the resonant features. We illustrate this mechanism in a supergravity model of
axion monodromy, which provides the first concrete model to realise such
resonant features. The model can sustain inflation for around 60 e-folds,
leading to considerable production of very light primordial black holes, and
large gravitational wave spectra, which could be detectable by multiple
upcoming gravitational wave surveys. For the set of parameter we consider,
large oscillations occur at all scales. This represents a challenge for the
model at large scales and motivates further investigation to reconcile this

perhaps less well-known that if we restrict the codomain of the Yoneda
embedding to the full subcategory of limit-preserving functors, then this
embedding preserves colimits, while still enjoying most of the other useful
properties of the Yoneda embedding. We call this modified embedding the Lambek

reflective subcategory of the category of all functors, i.e., there is a left
adjoint for the inclusion functor. In the literature, the existence of this
left adjoint is often proved non-constructively, e.g., by an application of
Freyd's adjoint functor theorem. In this paper, we provide an alternative, more
constructive proof of this fact. We first explain the Lambek embedding and why
it preserves coproducts. Then we review some concepts from multi-sorted

product-preserving presheaves and certain multi-sorted term algebras. We
provide a construction that freely turns any presheaf functor into a

letting $\epsilon$ go to $0$, we obtain a sequential algorithm for testing

measurement $\hat{x}$ on a system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates
$|x_{j}\rangle$ where the measurement is modeled by amplification. We prove an
equivalence between the positive phase-space distribution $Q(x,p,t)$, and
simultaneous backward and forward-propagating stochastic trajectories for
amplitudes $x$ and $p$. The sampling for the amplified variable $x$ is
specified by a future boundary condition determined by the measurement setting,
the backward and forward trajectories being linked at the initial-time boundary
to form a loop. We confirm that the joint densities for $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ yield
$Q(x,p,t)$, thus demonstrating causal consistency and Born's rule. A feature is
hidden vacuum noise associated with an eigenstate. Unlike the eigenvalue
$x_{j}$, this noise is not amplified, the fluctuations originating from future
boundary conditions. For macroscopic superpositions of $|x_{j}\rangle$, we show
consistency with macroscopic realism: the outcome for $\hat{x}$ can be
considered a real property at the time $t_{0}$ prior to measurement
(independent of future events). We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving
causal relations for amplified variables, along with hidden causal loops for
unamplified quantities, demonstrating that causal loops do not imply
(observable) retrocausality. Further, we evaluate $Q_{j}(x,p,0)$ for the
trajectories conditioned on the outcome $x_{j}$. The ``state'' defined by this
function cannot be a quantum state, the uncertainties for $\hat{x}$ and
$\hat{p}$ being too small. However, $Q_{j}(x,p,0)$ approaches that of
$|x_{j}\rangle$ for a macroscopic superposition. Our results provide a
framework for study of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell correlations.

sloping boundary generates a focusing mechanism if the angle between the
direction of propagation of the incident wave and the horizontal is close to
the slope inclination (near-critical reflection). We establish a rigorous
analysis of this phenomenon in two space dimensions, by providing an explicit
description of the form of the leading approximation of the unique Leray
solution to the near-critical reflection of internal waves from a slope within
a certain (nonlinear) time-scale. More precisely, we construct a consistent and
Lyapunov stable approximate solution, $L^2$ -close to the Leray solution, in
the form of a beam wave. Besides, beams being physically more meaningful than
plane waves, their spatial localization plays a key role in improving the
previous mathematical results from a twofold viewpoint: 1) our beam wave
approximate solution is the sum of a finite number of terms, each of them is a
consistent solution to the system and there is no artificial/non-physical
corrector; 2) thanks to 1) and the special structure of the nonlinear term, we
can improve the expansion of our solution up to two next orders, so providing a
more accurate approximation leading to a longer consistency time-scale.Finally,
our results provide a set of initial conditions localized on rays, for which
the Leray solution maintains approximately in $L^2$ the same localization.

proposed that the stringent constraints that univalence imposes on the growth

derive rigorous lower and upper bounds on hydrodynamic dispersion relation,
i.e., on all terms appearing in their convergent series representations. The
results are exact bounds on physical quantities such as the diffusivity and the
speed of sound. The purpose of this paper is to further explore these ideas,

we study diffusive and sound modes in a family of holographic axion models and

inductive (`b-dot') probe in a supersonic pulsed-power-driven plasma flow and
measure the magnetic field advected by the plasma. As the magnetic Reynolds
number is large ($R_M > 10$), the plasma flow advects a magnetic field
proportional to the current at the load. This enables us to estimate the plasma
flow velocity as a function of time from the delay between the current at the
load and the signal at the probe. The supersonic flow also generates a detached
hydrodynamic bow shock around the probe, the structure of which depends on the
upstream sonic Mach number. By imaging the shock around the probe with a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we determine the upstream Mach number from the
shock Mach angle, which we then use to determine the ion sound speed from the
known upstream velocity. We use the measured sound speed to infer the value of
$\bar{Z}T_e$, where $\bar{Z}$ is the average ionization, and $T_e$ is the
electron temperature. We use this diagnostic to measure the time-resolved

is well suited, as it represents a considerable challenge despite its
simplicity. The HP model has favorable interactions between adjacent, not
directly bound hydrophobic residues. Here, we develop a novel spin
representation for lattice protein folding tailored for quantum annealing. With
a distributed encoding onto the lattice, it differs from earlier attempts to
fold lattice proteins on quantum annealers, which were based upon chain growth
techniques. With our encoding, the Hamiltonian by design has the quadratic
structure required for calculations on an Ising-type annealer, without having
to introduce any auxiliary spin variables. This property greatly facilitates
the study of long chains. The approach is robust to changes in the parameters
required to constrain the spin system to chain-like configurations, and
performs very well in terms of solution quality. The results are evaluated
against existing exact results for HP chains with up to $N=30$ beads with 100%
hit rate, thereby also outperforming classical simulated annealing. In
addition, the method allows us to recover the lowest known energies for $N=48$
and $N=64$ HP chains, with similar hit rates. These results are obtained by the
commonly used hybrid quantum-classical approach. For pure quantum annealing,
our method successfully folds an $N=14$ HP chain. The calculations were

transmitted through the opaque shutter, gains a steep-rising front and its peak
intensity is locally increased at the cost of losing part of its energy. These
effects have a direct influence on subsequent ion acceleration from the
ultrathin target behind the shutter. In our 3D simulations of silicon nitride
plasma shutter and a silver target, the maximal energy of high-Z ions increases
significantly when the shutter is included for both linearly and circularly
polarized laser pulses. Moreover, application of the plasma shutter for
linearly polarized pulse results in focusing of ions towards the laser axis in
the plane perpendicular to the laser polarization. The generated high energy
ion beam has significantly lower divergence compared to the broad ion cloud,
generated without the shutter. The effects of prepulses are also investigated
assuming a double plasma shutter. The first shutter can withstand the assumed
sub-ns prepulse (treatment of ns and ps prepulses by other techniques is
assumed) and the pulse shaping occursvia interaction with the second shutter.

essential for an aetiological diagnosis of stone disease. However, in-situ

the current study, we assess the performance and added value of processing
complete digital endoscopic video sequences for the automatic recognition of
stone morphological features during a standard-of-care intra-operative session.
To this end, a computer-aided video classifier was developed to predict in-situ
the morphology of stone using an intra-operative digital endoscopic video
acquired in a clinical setting.
  The proposed technique was evaluated on pure (i.e. include one morphology)
and mixed (i.e. include at least two morphologies) stones involving ""Ia/Calcium
Oxalate Monohydrate (COM)"", ""IIb/ Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD)"" and
""IIIb/Uric Acid (UA)"" morphologies. 71 digital endoscopic videos (50 exhibited
only one morphological type and 21 displayed two) were analyzed using the
proposed video classifier (56840 frames processed in total). Using the proposed
approach, diagnostic performances (averaged over both pure and mixed stone
types) were as follows: balanced accuracy=88%, sensitivity=80%,
specificity=95%, precision=78% and F1-score=78%.
  The obtained results demonstrate that AI applied on digital endoscopic video
sequences is a promising tool for collecting morphological information during
the time-course of the stone fragmentation process without resorting to any
human intervention for stone delineation or selection of good quality steady

the induced modifications at the level of the gravitational-wave source, which
is encoded in terms of the power spectrum of the PBH gravitational potential,

that, within the observationally allowed range of the $f(T)$ model-parameters,
the obtained deviations from general relativity, both at the levels of source

complexity analysis to evaluate algorithmic options for the reliable creation

Markov chain-based algorithms and has important applications in machine
learning, combinatorial optimization and network science. For the quantum case,
qsampling from Markov chains can be constructed as preparing quantum states
with amplitudes arbitrarily close to the square root of a stationary
distribution instead of classical sampling from a stationary distribution. In
this paper, a new qsampling algorithm for all reversible Markov chains is
constructed by discrete-time quantum walks and works without any limit compared
with existing results. In detail, we build a qsampling algorithm that not only
accelerates non-regular graphs but also keeps the speed-up of existing quantum
algorithms for regular graphs. In non-regular graphs, the invocation of the
quantum fast-forward algorithm accelerates existing state-of-the-art qsampling
algorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time cases, especially on
sparse graphs. Compared to existing algorithms we reduce log n, where n is the
number of graph vertices. In regular graphs, our result matches other quantum
algorithms, and our reliance on the gap of Markov chains achieves quadratic
speedup compared with classical cases. For both cases, we reduce the number of
ancilla qubits required compared to the existing results. In some widely used
graphs and a series of sparse graphs where stationary distributions are
difficult to reach quickly, our algorithm is the first algorithm to achieve
complete quadratic acceleration (without log factor) over the classical case
without any limit. To enlarge success probability amplitude amplification is
introduced. We construct a new reflection on stationary state with fewer
ancilla qubits and think it may have independent application.

external sources. In contrast, classical reinforcement learning agents lack
such an ability and often resort to exploratory behavior. This is exacerbated
as few present-day environments support querying for knowledge. In order to
study how agents can be taught to query external knowledge via language, we
first introduce two new environments: the grid-world-based Q-BabyAI and the
text-based Q-TextWorld. In addition to physical interactions, an agent can
query an external knowledge source specialized for these environments to gather
information. Second, we propose the ""Asking for Knowledge"" (AFK) agent, which
learns to generate language commands to query for meaningful knowledge that
helps solve the tasks. AFK leverages a non-parametric memory, a pointer
mechanism and an episodic exploration bonus to tackle (1) irrelevant
information, (2) a large query language space, (3) delayed reward for making
meaningful queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFK agent
outperforms recent baselines on the challenging Q-BabyAI and Q-TextWorld
environments.

which misses a stabilizing effect of perturbations of the modulus ensuring
stability of a passive system on scales far exceeding the healing length.

anxiety is of high importance for decreasing accident rates, and enhancing road

help with this goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in
drivers' negative emotions and high stress level, might better help with
planning interventions. While studies have provided significant insight into
detecting drivers' emotions and stress levels, not many studies focused on the
reasons behind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study,
by using a naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the
driving scene, including road objects and the dynamical relationship between
the ego vehicle and the lead vehicle with respect to changes in drivers'
psychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions). Our
results indicate that different road objects might be associated with varying
levels of increase in drivers' HR as well as different proportions of negative
facial emotions detected through computer vision. Larger vehicles on the road,
such as trucks and buses, are associated with the highest amount of increase in
drivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally, shorter distances and
higher standard deviation in the distance to the lead vehicle are associated
with a higher number of abrupt increases in drivers' HR, depicting a possible
increase in stress level. Our finding indicates more positive emotions, lower
facial engagement, and a lower abrupt increase in HR at a higher speed of
driving, which often happens in highway environments. This research
collectively shows that driving at higher speeds happening in highways by
avoiding certain road objects might be a better fit for keeping drivers in a
calmer, more positive state.

processing different modalities. Unlike traditional dense models that always
activate all the model parameters, our model sparsely activates parts of the
parameters whose skills are relevant to the task. Such model design enables
SkillNet to learn skills in a more interpretable way. We develop our model for
five modalities including text, image, sound, video and code. Results show
that, SkillNet performs comparably to five modality-specific fine-tuned models.
Moreover, our model supports self-supervised pretraining with the same sparsely

modalities. We find that pretraining significantly improves the performance of
SkillNet on five modalities, on par with or even better than baselines with

address this issue within the framework of PAC learning, focusing on the class
of decision lists. Given that distributional assumptions are essential in the
adversarial setting, we work with probability distributions on the input data
that satisfy a Lipschitz condition: nearby points have similar probability. Our
key results illustrate that the adversary's budget (that is, the number of bits
it can perturb on each input) is a fundamental quantity in determining the
sample complexity of robust learning. Our first main result is a
sample-complexity lower bound: the class of monotone conjunctions (essentially
the simplest non-trivial hypothesis class on the Boolean hypercube) and any
superclass has sample complexity at least exponential in the adversary's
budget. Our second main result is a corresponding upper bound: for every fixed
$k$ the class of $k$-decision lists has polynomial sample complexity against a
$\log(n)$-bounded adversary. This sheds further light on the question of
whether an efficient PAC learning algorithm can always be used as an efficient
$\log(n)$-robust learning algorithm under the uniform distribution.

planar graphs $G$, called \textit{cloud partition}, which partitions the
vertices $V(G)$ into disjoint sets $C$ of size $O(\log n)$ such that each $C$
induces a connected subgraph of $G$. Using this partition $\mathcal{P}$ we
construct a so-called \textit{structure-maintaining minor} $F$ of $G$ via
specific contractions within the disjoint sets such that $F$ has $O(n/\log n)$

decomposition from planar graphs to $H$-minor-free graphs for any fixed graph
$H$. This allows us to construct the succinct encoding scheme for
$H$-minor-free graphs due to Blelloch and Farzan (CPM 2010) in $O(n)$ time and
$O(n)$ bits improving both runtime and space by a factor of $\Theta(\log n)$.

social science and public health research. Examples include studies of racial
disparity in health and voting. Recently, Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG), which uses Bayes' rule to combine information from Census surname files
with the geocoding of an individual's residence, has emerged as a leading
methodology for this prediction task. Unfortunately, BISG suffers from two
Census data problems that contribute to unsatisfactory predictive performance
for minorities. First, the decennial Census often contains zero counts for
minority racial groups in the Census blocks where some members of those groups
reside. Second, because the Census surname files only include frequent names,
many surnames -- especially those of minorities -- are missing from the list.
To address the zero counts problem, we introduce a fully Bayesian Improved
Surname Geocoding (fBISG) methodology that accounts for potential measurement
error in Census counts by extending the naive Bayesian inference of the BISG
methodology to full posterior inference. To address the missing surname
problem, we supplement the Census surname data with additional data on last,
first, and middle names taken from the voter files of six Southern states where
self-reported race is available. Our empirical validation shows that the fBISG
methodology and name supplements significantly improve the accuracy of race
imputation across all racial groups, and especially for Asians. The proposed
methodology, together with additional name data, is available via the
open-source software WRU.

living conditions, etc. Inferring impacts of MPI indicators on MPI index can be
solved by using traditional regression methods. However, it is not obvious that
whether solving one MPI indicator might resolve or cause more issues in other
MPI indicators and there is no framework dedicating to infer empirical causal
relations among MPI indicators.
  In this work, we propose a framework to infer causal relations on binary
variables in poverty surveys. Our approach performed better than baseline
methods in simulated datasets that we know ground truth as well as correctly
found a causal relation in the Twin births dataset. In Thailand poverty survey
dataset, the framework found a causal relation between smoking and alcohol
drinking issues. We provide R CRAN package `BiCausality' that can be used in
any binary variables beyond the poverty analysis context.

unit-demand valuations, subject to a hard budget limit. Without financial
constraints and pure quasilinear bidders, this assignment model allows for a
simple ascending auction format that maximizes welfare and is
incentive-compatible and core-stable. Introducing budget constraints, the
ascending auction requires strong additional conditions on the unit-demand

we cannot hope for an incentive-compatible and core-stable mechanism. We design
an iterative algorithm that depends solely on a trivially verifiable ex-post

auctioneer, always yields a welfare-maximizing and core-stable outcome. If
these conditions do not hold, we cannot hope for incentive-compatibility and
computing welfare-maximizing assignments and core-stable prices is hard: Even
in the presence of value queries, where bidders reveal their valuations and
budgets truthfully, we prove that the problem becomes NP-complete for the
assignment market model. The analysis complements complexity results for
markets with more complex valuations and shows that even with simple
unit-demand bidders the problem becomes intractable. This raises doubts on the
efficiency of simple auction designs as they are used in high-stakes markets,

earlier theories to solve the second-order inhomogeneous problem, resulting in
considerable simplification and adding insight by making it possible to treat a

influenced by both the global features of the nuclear force and the nucleonic
shell structure. As functions of proton and neutron number, both quantities
show regular patterns and, for nuclei away from magic numbers, they change very
smoothly from nucleus to nucleus. In this paper, we explain how the local shell
effects are impacting the statistical correlations between quadrupole
deformations and charge radii in well-deformed even-even Er, Yb, and Hf
isotopes. This implies, in turn, that sudden changes in correlations can be
useful indicators of underlying shell effects. Our theoretical analysis is
performed in the framework of self-consistent mean-field theory using
quantified energy density functionals and density-dependent pairing forces. The
statistical analysis is carried out by means of the linear least-square
regression. The local variations of nuclear quadrupole deformations and charge
radii, explained in terms of occupations individual deformed Hartree-Fock
orbits, make and imprint on statistical correlations of computed observables.
While the calculated deformations or charge radii are, in some cases,
correlated with those of their even-even neighbors, the correlations seem to
deteriorate rapidly with particle number. The statistical correlations between
nuclear deformations and charge radii of different nuclei are affected by the
underlying shell structure. Even for well deformed and superfluid nuclei for
which these observables change smoothly, the correlation range usually does not
exceed $\Delta N=4$ and $\Delta Z=4$, i.e., it is rather short. This result
suggests that the frequently made assumption of reduced statistical errors for
the differences between smoothly-varying observables cannot be generally
justified.

modular programming style that solves challenging problems such as the
Expression Problem. CP is implemented on top of a polymorphic core language
with disjoint intersection types called Fi+. The semantics of Fi+ employs an
elaboration to a target language and relies on a sophisticated proof technique
to prove the coherence of the elaboration. Unfortunately, the proof technique
is technically challenging and hard to scale to many common features, including
recursion or impredicative polymorphism. Thus, the original formulation of Fi+
does not support the two later features, which creates a gap between theory and
practice, since CP fundamentally relies on them.
  This paper presents a new formulation of Fi+ based on a type-directed
operational semantics (TDOS). The TDOS approach was recently proposed to model
the semantics of languages with disjoint intersection types (but without
polymorphism). Our work shows that the TDOS approach can be extended to
languages with disjoint polymorphism and model the full Fi+ calculus. Unlike
the elaboration semantics, which gives the semantics to Fi+ indirectly via a
target language, the TDOS approach gives a semantics to Fi+ directly. With a
TDOS, there is no need for a coherence proof. Instead, we can simply prove that
the semantics is deterministic. The proof of determinism only uses simple
reasoning techniques, such as straightforward induction, and is able to handle
problematic features such as recursion and impredicative polymorphism. This
removes the gap between theory and practice and validates the original proofs
of correctness for CP. We formalized the TDOS variant of the Fi+ calculus and
all its proofs in the Coq proof assistant.

previous works have proposed different data augmentations strategies for NLP,
such as noise injection, word replacement, back-translation etc. Though
effective, they missed one important characteristic of
language--compositionality, meaning of a complex expression is built from its
sub-parts. Motivated by this, we propose a compositional data augmentation
approach for natural language understanding called TreeMix. Specifically,
TreeMix leverages constituency parsing tree to decompose sentences into
constituent sub-structures and the Mixup data augmentation technique to
recombine them to generate new sentences. Compared with previous approaches,
TreeMix introduces greater diversity to the samples generated and encourages
models to learn compositionality of NLP data. Extensive experiments on text
classification and SCAN demonstrate that TreeMix outperforms current
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

certified accuracy, average certified radii and abstention rates as compared to

mortality rates in the 1920s and ischaemic heart disease in the 1970s. We go

inclusion of local geographic area fixed effects, but not family fixed effects.
Second, we explore whether the average effects conceal underlying
heterogeneity: we examine if the infant mortality effect offsets or reinforces
one's genetic predisposition for heart disease. We find considerable
heterogeneity that is robust to within-area as well as within-family analyses.
Our findings show that the effects of one's early life environments mainly
affect individuals with the highest genetic risk for developing heart disease.
Put differently, in areas with the lowest infant mortality rates, the effect of
one's genetic predisposition effectively vanishes. These findings suggest that
advantageous environments can cushion one's genetic risk of developing heart
disease.

  Assessment of Power System","8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables",,,,"eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The real-time transient stability assessment (TSA) plays a critical role in
the secure operation of the power system. Although the classic numerical
integration method, \textit{i.e.} time-domain simulation (TDS), has been widely
used in industry practice, it is inevitably trapped in a high computational
complexity due to the high latitude sophistication of the power system. In this
work, a data-driven power system estimation method is proposed to quickly
predict the stability of the power system before TDS reaches the end of
simulating time windows, which can reduce the average simulation time of
stability assessment without loss of accuracy. As the topology of the power
system is in the form of graph structure, graph neural network based
representation learning is naturally suitable for learning the status of the
power system. Motivated by observing the distribution information of crucial
active power and reactive power on the power system's bus nodes, we thus
propose a distribution-aware learning~(DAL) module to explore an informative
graph representation vector for describing the status of a power system. Then,
TSA is re-defined as a binary classification task, and the stability of the
system is determined directly from the resulting graph representation without
numerical integration. Finally, we apply our method to the online TSA task. The
case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system and Polish 2383-bus system demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

perturbations of the primordial medium, which, post recombination, lead to the
formation of galaxy clusters and galaxies. Aims: We analyse the perturbation
wave modes of the primordial medium at and before recombination, consisting of
a fully ionized baryonic plasma, a strong black body radiation field, and cold
dark matter. Methods: We use the linear perturbation theory of the relativistic
equations of motion, utilising a strict thermodynamic equilibrium model that
relates the radiation energy density to the plasma temperature. Results: It is
shown that a wave mode corresponding to the postulated baryon acoustic waves
exists with a phase velocity close to the speed of light, but the participation
of the dark matter in this mode is very small. Instead, the dark matter has its
own dominant mode in the form of gravitational collapse, with very little
participation by the baryonic plasma. Conclusions: In view of this very weak
coupling between baryons and dark matter, the initial conditions postulated for
computer simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation, which
assume that after recombination, when galaxy formation is getting underway,
baryon and dark matter density perturbations are spatially coincident in terms
of fractional amplitude, may be unjustified. In addition the possible
non-coincidence of baryon and dark matter perturbations at the last scattering
surface has implications for the analysis of cosmic microwave background

Hawking radiation, when the radiation is considered in terms of the quantum
tunneling. We consider the origin of such temperature for the black hole
horizon and also for the cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime. In case
the black hole horizon, there are two contributions to the tunneling process of
radiation, each being governed by the temperature $T=2T_H$. These processes are
coherently combined to produce the radiation with the Hawking temperature
$T_H$. This can be traditionally interpreted as the pair creation of two
entangled particles, of which one goes towards the centre of the black hole,
while the other one escapes from the black hole. In case of the cosmological
horizon, the temperature $T=2T_H$ is physical. While the creation of the
entangled pair is described by the Hawking temperature, the de Sitter spacetime
allows for the another process, in which only single (non-entangled) particle
inside the cosmological horizon is created. This process is characterized by
the local temperature $T=2T_H$. Such single particle process takes place also
outside the black hole horizon, but it is exponentially suppressed.

vibronic couplings are well differentiated for a wide range of driving forces
and how entropic effects become apparent in large vibronic systems. These

learning and modeling of unknown dynamical systems using fully- or
partially-observed data. The method utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) to
construct a model for the flow map of the unknown system. Once an accurate DNN
approximation of the flow map is constructed, it can be recursively executed to
serve as an effective predictive model of the unknown system. In this paper, we
apply this framework to chaotic systems, in particular the well-known Lorenz 63
and 96 systems, and critically examine the predictive performance of the
approach. A distinct feature of chaotic systems is that even the smallest
perturbations will lead to large (albeit bounded) deviations in the solution
trajectories. This makes long-term predictions of the method, or any data
driven methods, questionable, as the local model accuracy will eventually
degrade and lead to large pointwise errors. Here we employ several other
qualitative and quantitative measures to determine whether the chaotic dynamics
have been learned. These include phase plots, histograms, autocorrelation,
correlation dimension, approximate entropy, and Lyapunov exponent. Using these
measures, we demonstrate that the flow map based DNN learning method is capable
of accurately modeling chaotic systems, even when only a subset of the state
variables are available to the DNNs. For example, for the Lorenz 96 system with
40 state variables, when data of only 3 variables are available, the method is
able to learn an effective DNN model for the 3 variables and produce accurately
the chaotic behavior of the system.

the modeling of 3D and 3+1D geometry. With this increased popularity comes the
need for efficient algorithms for common operations such as normalization,
square roots, and exponential and logarithmic maps. The current work presents a
signature agnostic analysis of these common operations in all geometric
algebras of dimension $n < 6$, and gives efficient numerical implementations in
the most popular algebras $\mathbb{R}_{4}$, $\mathbb{R}_{3,1}$,
$\mathbb{R}_{3,0,1}$ and $\mathbb{R}_{4,1}$, in the hopes of lowering the
threshold for adoption of geometric algebra solutions by code maintainers.
