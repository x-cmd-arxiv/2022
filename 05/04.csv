particular, the ""training"" phase reorders data and exploit the power of
pretrained models to compute a class prototype and fill a memory bank. At
inference time we match the closest prototype through a knn-like approach,

results, we compare the devised pipeline with common CNN models and show the

(possibly random) locally finite graph whose vertices and edges are equipped
with marks representing parameters of the model such as the environment and
initial conditions. Each particle takes values in a countable state space and
evolves according to a pure jump process whose jump intensities depend on only
the states (or histories) and marks of itself and particles and edges in its
neighborhood. Under mild conditions, it is shown that if the sequence of
(marked) interaction graphs converges locally in probability to a limit
(marked) graph that satisfies a certain finite dissociability property, then
the corresponding sequence of empirical measures of the particle trajectories
converges weakly to the law of the marginal dynamics at the root vertex of the
limit graph. The proof of this limit relies on several results of independent
interest. First, such interacting particle systems are shown to be well-posed
on almost surely finitely dissociable graphs, which include graphs of maximal
bounded degree and any Galton-Watson tree whose offspring distribution has a
finite first moment. A counterexample is provided to show that well-posedness
can fail for dynamics on graphs outside this class. Second, the dynamics on a
locally convergent sequence of graphs are shown to converge in the local weak
sense to the dynamics on the limit graph when the latter is finitely
dissociable. Finally, the dynamics are also shown to exhibit an (annealed)
asymptotic correlation decay property. These results complement recent work
that establishes hydrodynamic limits of locally interacting probabilistic
cellular automata and diffusions on sparse random graphs. However, the analysis
of jump processes requires very different techniques, including percolation
arguments and notions such as (consistent) spatial localization and causal
chains.

non-linear and challenging to analyze using a statistical model for future
prediction. In this paper, we investigated and evaluated the performance of
different statistical prediction models for real IP network traffic; and showed
a significant improvement in prediction using the rolling prediction technique.
Initially, a set of best hyper-parameters for the corresponding prediction
model is identified by analyzing the traffic characteristics and implementing a
grid search algorithm based on the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
Then, we performed a comparative performance analysis among AutoRegressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), SARIMA with
eXogenous factors (SARIMAX), and Holt-Winter for single-step prediction. The
seasonality of our traffic has been explicitly modeled using SARIMA, which
reduces the rolling prediction Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more
than 4% compared to ARIMA (incapable of handling the seasonality). We further
improved traffic prediction using SARIMAX to learn different exogenous factors
extracted from the original traffic, which yielded the best rolling prediction
results with a MAPE of 6.83%. Finally, we applied the exponential smoothing
technique to handle the variability in traffic following the Holt-Winter model,
which exhibited a better prediction than ARIMA (around 1.5% less MAPE). The
rolling prediction technique reduced prediction error using real Internet

such as propensity score matching, the PC algorithm and invariant causal
prediction, have been introduced. Besides its interpretational appeal, the
causal model provides the best out-of-sample prediction guarantees. In this
paper, we study the identification of causal-like models from in-sample data
that provide out-of-sample risk guarantees when predicting a target variable
from a set of covariates.
  Whereas ordinary least squares provides the best in-sample risk with limited
out-of-sample guarantees, causal models have the best out-of-sample guarantees
but achieve an inferior in-sample risk. By defining a trade-off of these
properties, we introduce $\textit{causal regularization}$. As the
regularization is increased, it provides estimators whose risk is more stable
across sub-samples at the cost of increasing their overall in-sample risk. The
increased risk stability is shown to lead to out-of-sample risk guarantees. We
provide finite sample risk bounds for all models and prove the adequacy of
cross-validation for attaining these bounds.

to visible light face recognition due to its advantages of independent
background light, strong penetration, ability of imaging under harsh
environments such as nighttime, rain and fog. However, cross-spectral face
recognition (i.e., VIS to IR) is very challenging due to the dramatic
difference between the visible light and IR imageries as well as the lack of
paired training data. This paper proposes a framework of bidirectional
cross-spectral conversion (BCSC-GAN) between the heterogeneous face images, and
designs an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism based on information fusion
theory. The network reduces the cross-spectral recognition problem into an
intra-spectral problem, and improves performance by fusing bidirectional
information. Specifically, a face identity retaining module (IRM) is introduced
with the ability to preserve identity features, and a new composite loss
function is designed to overcome the modal differences caused by different
spectral characteristics. Two datasets of TINDERS and CASIA were tested, where
performance metrics of FID, recognition rate, equal error rate and normalized
distance were compared. Results show that our proposed network is superior than
other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed rule of Self
Adaptive Weighted Fusion (SAWF) is better than the recognition results of the
unfused case and other traditional fusion rules that are commonly used, which
further justifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
bidirectional conversion approach.

Nakajima quiver varieties is known as the the capping operator. It is uniquely
determined as the fundamental solution to a system of $q$-difference equations.
Such difference equations involve shifts of two sets of variables, the
variables arising as equivariant parameters for a torus that acts on the
variety and an additional set of variables known as K\""ahler parameters. The
difference equations in the former variables were identified with the qKZ
equations in [28]. The difference equations in the latter variables were
identified representation theoretically in [30] using an analog of the quantum
dynamical Weyl group.
  Once this representation theoretic description is known, there is an obvious
generalization of these equations, which we refer to as exotic quantum
difference equations. They depend on a choice of alcove in a certain hyperplane
arrangement in $\mathrm{Pic}(X)\otimes \mathbb{R}$, with the usual difference
equations corresponding to the alcove containing small anti-ample line bundles.
As our main result, we relate the fundamental solution of these equations back
to quasimap counts using the so-called vertex with descendants, with
descendants given in terms of $K$-theoretic stable envelopes.
  In the case of the Hilbert scheme of points in $\mathbb{C}^2$, we write our
exotic quantum difference equations using the quantum toroidal algebra. We use
the results of [6] to obtain formulas for the $K$-theoretic stable envelopes of
arbitrary slope. Using this, we are able to write explicit formulas for the
solutions of the exotic difference equations. These formulas can be written as
contour integrals. As a partially conjectural application of our results, we
apply the saddlepoint approximation to these integrals to diagonalize the Bethe
subalgebras of the quantum toroidal algebra for arbitrary slope.

component in many numerical schemes and its performance is known to be severely
limited by main memory access. Several numerical schemes require the
multiplication of a sparse matrix polynomial with a dense vector, which is
typically implemented as a sequence of SpMVs. This results in low performance
and ignores the potential to increase the arithmetic intensity by reusing the
matrix data from cache. In this work we use the recursive algebraic coloring
engine (RACE) to enable blocking of sparse matrix data across the polynomial
computations. In the graph representing the sparse matrix we form levels using
a breadth-first search. Locality relations of these levels are then used to
improve spatial and temporal locality when accessing the matrix data and to
implement an efficient multithreaded parallelization. Our approach is
independent of the matrix structure and avoids shortcomings of existing
""blocking"" strategies in terms of hardware efficiency and parallelization
overhead. We quantify the quality of our implementation using performance
modelling and demonstrate speedups of up to 3$\times$ and 5$\times$ compared to
an optimal SpMV-based baseline on a single multicore chip of recent Intel and
AMD architectures. As a potential application, we demonstrate the benefit of
our implementation for a Chebyshev time propagation scheme, representing the
class of polynomial approximations to exponential integrators. Further
numerical schemes which may benefit from our developments include $s$-step

retrieve documents that are relevant for the analysis from large corpora of
otherwise irrelevant documents. The conventional approach in social science to
address this retrieval task is to apply a set of keywords and to consider those
documents to be relevant that contain at least one of the keywords. But the
application of incomplete keyword lists risks drawing biased inferences. More
complex and costly methods such as query expansion techniques, topic
model-based classification rules, and active as well as passive supervised
learning could have the potential to more accurately separate relevant from
irrelevant documents and thereby reduce the potential size of bias. Yet,
whether applying these more expensive approaches increases retrieval
performance compared to keyword lists at all, and if so, by how much, is
unclear as a comparison of these approaches is lacking. This study closes this
gap by comparing these methods across three retrieval tasks associated with a
data set of German tweets (Linder, 2017), the Social Bias Inference Corpus
(SBIC) (Sap et al., 2020), and the Reuters-21578 corpus (Lewis, 1997). Results
show that query expansion techniques and topic model-based classification rules
in most studied settings tend to decrease rather than increase retrieval
performance. Active supervised learning, however, if applied on a not too small
set of labeled training instances (e.g. 1,000 documents), reaches a
substantially higher retrieval performance than keyword lists.

NAACL Industry Track",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatically associating social media posts with topics is an important
prerequisite for effective search and recommendation on many social media
platforms. However, topic classification of such posts is quite challenging
because of (a) a large topic space (b) short text with weak topical cues, and
(c) multiple topic associations per post. In contrast to most prior work which
only focuses on post classification into a small number of topics ($10$-$20$),
we consider the task of large-scale topic classification in the context of
Twitter where the topic space is $10$ times larger with potentially multiple
topic associations per Tweet. We address the challenges above by proposing a
novel neural model, CTM that (a) supports a large topic space of $300$ topics
and (b) takes a holistic approach to tweet content modeling -- leveraging
multi-modal content, author context, and deeper semantic cues in the Tweet. Our
method offers an effective way to classify Tweets into topics at scale by
yielding superior performance to other approaches (a relative lift of
$\mathbf{20}\%$ in median average precision score) and has been successfully
deployed in production at Twitter.

was trained with a physics-based regularization term incorporating the spoiled

Fully-sampled VFA k-space data were retrospectively accelerated by factors of
R={8,12,18,36} and reconstructed with ConvDecoder (CD), ConvDecoder with the
proposed regularization (CD+r), locally low-rank (LR) reconstruction, and
compressed sensing with L1-wavelet regularization (L1). Final images from CD+r
training were evaluated at the \emph{argmin} of the regularization loss;
whereas the CD, LR, and L1 reconstructions were chosen optimally based on
ground truth data. The performance measures used were the normalized root-mean
square error, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and the structural
similarity index (SSIM). The CD+r reconstructions, chosen using the stopping
condition, yielded SSIMs that were similar to the CD (p=0.47) and LR SSIMs
(p=0.95) across R and that were significantly higher than the L1 SSIMs
(p=0.04). The CCC values for the CD+r T1 maps across all R and subjects were
greater than those corresponding to the L1 (p=0.15) and LR (p=0.13) T1 maps,
respectively. For R > 12 (<4.2 minutes scan time), L1 and LR T1 maps exhibit a
loss of spatially refined details compared to CD+r. We conclude that the use of
an untrained neural network together with a physics-based regularization loss
shows promise as a measure for determining the optimal stopping point in
training without relying on fully-sampled ground truth data.

propose a new computational approach to tackle the problem with much lower
memory and computational requirements, which can naturally utilize certain
intuitions, but also can maintain the strong computational advantage of the
existing computational approach. A reformulation of the underlying optimization
problem is first proposed, which converts the large linear program to a maximin
problem. This leads to an iterative solving procedure, which uses the LP dual
to carry over learned evidence between iterations. The key in the reformulated
problem is the selection of good information inequalities, with which a relaxed
LP can be formed. A particularly powerful intuition is a potentially optimal
code construction, and we provide a method that directly utilizes it in the new
algorithm. As an application, we derive a tighter outer bound for the
storage-repair tradeoff for the $(6,5,5)$ regenerating code problem, which
involves at least 30 random variables and is impossible to compute with the

asymptotic form $\varphi(t)\sim t^{-1-\alpha}$, significant changes in the
properties of the conditioned backward and forward times happen at half-integer

airworthiness checks, as their inspection process is tedious and extremely
subject to human factors and environmental conditions. Nowadays, 3D scanning
technologies are being proposed for more reliable, human-independent
measurements, yet the process of inspection and reporting remains laborious and
time consuming because data acquisition and validation are still carried out by
the engineer. For full automation of dent inspection, the acquired point cloud
data must be analysed via a reliable segmentation algorithm, releasing humans
from the search and evaluation of damage. This paper reports on two
developments towards automated dent inspection. The first is a method to
generate a synthetic dataset of dented surfaces to train a fully convolutional
neural network. The training of machine learning algorithms needs a substantial
volume of dent data, which is not readily available. Dents are thus simulated
in random positions and shapes, within criteria and definitions of a Boeing 737
structural repair manual. The noise distribution from the scanning apparatus is
then added to reflect the complete process of 3D point acquisition on the
training. The second proposition is a surface fitting strategy to convert 3D
point clouds to 2.5D. This allows higher resolution point clouds to be
processed with a small amount of memory compared with state-of-the-art methods
involving 3D sampling approaches. Simulations with available ground truth data
show that the proposed technique reaches an intersection-over-union of over
80%. Experiments over dent samples prove an effective detection of dents with a
speed of over 500 000 points per second.

we prove that for any such minimizing curve, the time it takes to hit the

prior beliefs and a model of the target system, what is the probability
distribution of some set of unobserved quantities or latent variables at some
time, possibly in the future?
  While data assimilation has developed rapidly in some areas, relatively
little progress has been made in performing data assimilation with agent-based
models. This has hampered the use of agent-based models to make quantitative
claims about real-world systems.
  Here we present an algorithm that uses Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo methods to
generate samples of the parameters and trajectories of an agent-based model
over a window of time given a set of possibly noisy, aggregated and incomplete
observations of the system. This can be used as-is, or as part of a data
assimilation cycle or sequential-MCMC algorithm.

have a finite set of states and a finite number of ways of acting on the world.
As presented the algorithm is only practical for agents with a few bytes of
internal state although we discuss ways of removing this restriction. We
demonstrate the algorithm by performing data assimilation with an agent-based,

properties optimization and inverse design of manufacturing parameters is
limited due to the high computational cost associated with this kind of model.
In this work, we tackle this issue by proposing an innovative approach,
supported by a deterministic machine learning (ML)-assisted pipeline for
multi-objective optimization of LIB electrode properties and inverse design of
its manufacturing process. Firstly, the pipeline generates a synthetic dataset
from physics-based simulations with low discrepancy sequences, that allow to
sufficiently represent the manufacturing parameters space. Secondly, the
generated dataset is used to train deterministic ML models for the
implementation of a fast multi-objective optimization, to identify an optimal
electrode and the manufacturing parameters to adopt in order to fabricate it.
Lastly, this electrode was successfully fabricated experimentally, proving that
our modeling pipeline prediction is physical-relevant. Here, we demonstrate our

species in the upper atmospheres of giant exoplanets. In this work we conducted
a homogeneous survey of Na in a diverse sample of ten highly irradiated giant
exoplanets using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Our sample includes
nine planets with previous Na detections and one new detection. We confirm
previous detections and assess multiple approaches for deriving Na line
properties from high-resolution transmission spectra. The homogeneously
measured sodium line depths were used to constrain the atmospheric heights
($H_{\text{Na}}$) with respect to the planetary radii ($R_{\text{p}}$). We
assess an empirical trend describing the relative atmospheric height
($H_{\text{Na}}/R_{\text{p}}$) as a function of planetary equilibrium
temperature ($T_{\text{eq}}$) and surface gravity ($g$), in which
$H_{\text{Na}}/R_{\text{p}}$ decreases exponentially with $\xi \propto
gT_{\text{eq}}$, approaching a constant at large $\xi$. We also report the
sodium D2/D1 line ratios across our sample and find that seven targets have
line ratios that are consistent with unity. Finally, we measured net
blueshifted offsets of the sodium absorption lines from their rest frame
wavelengths for all ten planets, corresponding to day-night wind velocities of
a few km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that the broad sample of exoplanets share
common underlying processes that govern atmospheric dynamics. Our study
highlights a promising avenue for using high-resolution transmission
spectroscopy to further our understanding of how atmospheric characteristics
vary over a diverse sample of exoplanets.

  Comprehensive Model",,,,,"cs.HC cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Eye-tracking technology is an integral component of new display devices such
as virtual and augmented reality headsets. Applications of gaze information
range from new interaction techniques exploiting eye patterns to
gaze-contingent digital content creation. However, system latency is still a
significant issue in many of these applications because it breaks the
synchronization between the current and measured gaze positions. Consequently,
it may lead to unwanted visual artifacts and degradation of user experience. In
this work, we focus on foveated rendering applications where the quality of an
image is reduced towards the periphery for computational savings. In foveated
rendering, the presence of latency leads to delayed updates to the rendered
frame, making the quality degradation visible to the user. To address this
issue and to combat system latency, recent work proposes to use saccade landing
position prediction to extrapolate the gaze information from delayed
eye-tracking samples. While the benefits of such a strategy have already been
demonstrated, the solutions range from simple and efficient ones, which make
several assumptions about the saccadic eye movements, to more complex and
costly ones, which use machine learning techniques. Yet, it is unclear to what
extent the prediction can benefit from accounting for additional factors. This
paper presents a series of experiments investigating the importance of
different factors for saccades prediction in common virtual and augmented
reality applications. In particular, we investigate the effects of saccade
orientation in 3D space and smooth pursuit eye-motion (SPEM) and how their
influence compares to the variability across users. We also present a simple
yet efficient correction method that adapts the existing saccade prediction
methods to handle these factors without performing extensive data collection.

equivalently by finite automata in which each letter induces a permutation on
the set of states. We investigate the separation problem for this class of
languages: given two arbitrary regular languages as input, we show how to
decide if there exists a group language containing the first one while being
disjoint from the second. We prove that covering, a problem generalizing
separation, is decidable. A simple covering algorithm was already known: it can
be obtained indirectly as a corollary of an algebraic theorem by Ash.
Unfortunately, while deducing the algorithm from this algebraic result is
straightforward, all proofs of Ash's result itself require a strong background
on algebraic concepts, and a wealth of technical machinery outside of automata
theory. Our proof is independent of previous ones. It relies exclusively on
standard notions from automata theory: we directly deal with separation and
work with input languages represented by nondeterministic finite automata.
  We also investigate two strict subclasses. First, the alphabet modulo
testable languages are those defined by counting the occurrences of each letter
modulo some fixed integer (equivalently, they are the languages recognized by a
commutative group). Secondly, the modulo languages are those defined by
counting the length of words modulo some fixed integer. We prove that covering
is decidable for both classes, with algorithms that rely on the construction
made for group languages.
  Our proofs lead to tight complexity bounds for separation for all three
classes, as well as for covering for both alphabet modulo testable languages

algorithm utilizes the well-known Gaussian smoothing technique, which yields
unbiased zeroth-order gradient estimators of a related partially smooth
surrogate problem (in which one of the two nonsmooth terms in the original
problem's objective is replaced by a smooth approximation). This allows us to
employ a standard proximal stochastic gradient scheme for the approximate
solution of the surrogate problem, which is determined by a single smoothing
parameter, and without the utilization of first-order information. We provide
state-of-the-art convergence rates for the proposed zeroth-order method using
minimal assumptions. The proposed scheme is numerically compared against
alternative zeroth-order methods as well as a stochastic sub-gradient scheme on
a standard phase retrieval problem. Further, we showcase the usefulness and

correspondences refinement, outliers recognition and missing key-points

spiral optical microcavities in which the asymmetric scattering between

be symmetric but complex in a microscopically derived 2 x 2 matrix model,
resulting in non-Hermitian behaviour as well. Most importantly, the M\""obius

further propose the comprehensive multi-level feature alignment to improve the

cross-scale self-attention mechanism in Deformable DETR. Image and object
features are aligned at the local, global, and instance levels with domain
query-based feature alignment (DQFA), bi-level graph-based prototype alignment
(BGPA), and token-wise image feature alignment (TIFA). On the other hand, the
unlabeled target domain data pseudo-labeled and available for the object
detection training by the mean teacher framework can lead to better feature
extraction and alignment. Thus, the mean teacher framework and the
comprehensive multi-level feature alignment can be optimized iteratively and
mutually based on the architecture of Transformers. Extensive experiments

$k$-factor that can be partitioned into $k$ edge-disjoint $1$-factors. Busch et

trajectories and NOMA decoding orders of robots, phase-shift coefficients of
the RIS, and the power allocation of the AP, subject to predicted initial and
final positions of robots and the quality of service (QoS) of each robot. To
tackle this problem, an integrated machine learning (ML) scheme is proposed,
which combines long short-term memory (LSTM)-autoregressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA) model and dueling double deep Q-network (D$^{3}$QN) algorithm.
For initial and final position prediction for robots, the LSTM-ARIMA is able to
overcome the problem of gradient vanishment of non-stationary and non-linear
sequences of data. For jointly determining the phase shift matrix and robots'
trajectories, D$^{3}$QN is invoked for solving the problem of action value
overestimation. Based on the proposed scheme, each robot holds an optimal
trajectory based on the maximum sum-rate of a whole trajectory, which reveals
that robots pursue long-term benefits for whole trajectory design. Numerical
results demonstrated that: 1) LSTM-ARIMA model provides high accuracy
predicting model; 2) The proposed D$^{3}$QN algorithm can achieve fast average
convergence; and 3) RIS-NOMA networks have superior network performance

to be a powerful quantum-informative signature of boundary states of gapped
topological phases of matter, e.g., topological insulators and topological
superconductors, where the finite bulk gap allows us to establish a
crystal-clear correspondence between $1/2$ modes and boundary states. Here we
investigate the recently proposed higher-order Weyl semimetals (HOWSM), where
bulk supports gapless higher-order Weyl nodes and boundary supports hinge arcs
and Fermi arcs. We find that the aim of unambiguously identifying higher-order
boundary states ultimately drives us to make full use of eigen quantities of
the entanglement Hamiltonian: ES as well as Schmidt vectors (entanglement
wavefunctions, abbr. EWF). We demonstrate that, while both hinge arcs and Fermi
arcs contribute to $1/2$ modes, the EWFs corresponding to hinge arcs and Fermi
arcs are respectively localized on the virtual hinges and surfaces of the
partition. Besides, by means of various symmetry-breaking partitions, we can
identify the minimal crystalline symmetries that protect boundary states.
Therefore, for gapless topological phases such as HOWSMs, we can combine ES and
EWF to universally identify boundary states and potential symmetry requirement.
While HOWSMs are prototypical examples of gapless phases, our work sheds light
on general theory of entanglement signature in gapless topological phases of

oxygen (O2) ice has been at the center of a scientific debate as the surface
temperature of the Jovian moon is on average well above the freezing point of
O2. Laboratory evidence suggested that solid O2 may either exist in a cold (<50
K) subsurface layer of the icy surface of Ganymede, or it is in an atmospheric
haze of the moon. Alternatively, O2 is constantly replenished at the surface
through ion irradiation of water-containing ices. A conclusive answer on the
existence of solid O2 on the surface of Ganymede is hampered by the lack of
detailed, extensive observational datasets. We present new ground-based,
high-resolution spectroscopic observations of Ganymede's surface obtained at
the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. These are combined with dedicated laboratory
measurements of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) photoabsorption spectra of O2 ice,
both pure and mixed with other species of potential interest for the Galilean
satellites. Our study confirms that the two bands identified in the visible
spectra of Ganymede's surface are due to the (1,0) and (0,0) transition bands
of O2 ice. Oxygen-rich ice mixtures including water (H2O) and carbon dioxide
(CO2) can reproduce observational reflectance data of the Ganymede's surface
better than pure O2 ice in the temperature range 20-35 K. Solid H2O and CO2
also provide an environment where O2 ice can be trapped at higher temperatures
than its pure ice desorption under vacuum space conditions. Our experiments at
different temperatures show also that the (1,0)/(0,0) ratio in case of the
CO2:O2=1:2 ice mixture at 35 K has the closest value to observations, while at
30 K the (1,0)/(0,0) ratio seems to be mixture independent with the exception
of the N2:O2=1:2 ice mixture. The present work will support the ESA/JUICE

with LOFAR. The combination of its observed brightness temperature and circular
polarisation fraction suggests that the emission is generated via the
electron-cyclotron maser instability. Two distinct mechanisms have been
proposed to power such emission from low-mass stars: either a sub-Alfv\'enic
interaction between the stellar magnetic field and an orbiting planet, or
reconnection at the edge of the stellar magnetosphere. In this paper, we
investigate the feasibility of both mechanisms, utilising the information about
the star's surrounding plasma environment obtained from modelling its stellar
wind. Using this information, we show that a Neptune-sized exoplanet with a
magnetic field strength of 10-100 G orbiting at ~0.034 au can accurately
reproduce the observed radio emission from the star, with corresponding orbital
periods of 7.4 days. Due to the stellar inclination, a planet in an equatorial
orbit is unlikely to transit the star. While such a planet could induce radial
velocity semi-amplitudes from 7 to 396 m s$^{-1}$, it is unlikely that this
signal could be detected with current techniques due to the activity of the
host star. The application of our planet-induced radio emission model here
illustrates its exciting potential as a new tool for identifying planet-hosting
candidates from long-term radio monitoring. We also develop a model to
investigate the reconnection-powered emission scenario. While this approach
produces less favourable results than the planet-induced scenario, it
nevertheless serves as a potential alternative emission mechanism which is
worth exploring further.

provide 10 MeV protons with a peak current of 10 mA within a 5\% duty cycle.

  In this work, we used a safe language generation task (``avoid injuries'') as
a testbed for achieving high reliability through adversarial training. We
created a series of adversarial training techniques -- including a tool that
assists human adversaries -- to find and eliminate failures in a classifier
that filters text completions suggested by a generator. In our task, we
determined that we can set very conservative classifier thresholds without
significantly impacting the quality of the filtered outputs. We found that
adversarial training increased robustness to the adversarial attacks that we
trained on -- doubling the time for our contractors to find adversarial

close to the LMC, and spans a large portion of the Milky Way's halo. We
represent the Milky Way--LMC system using basis function expansions that
capture their evolution in an $N$-body simulation. We present the properties of

high-resolution NIRSpec gratings (G140H+G235H+G395H) that together span the

low as 3 mbar and 0.1 mbar for K2-18 b and TOI-732 c, respectively, assuming a
nominal 10x solar metallicity. The constraints vary with instrument

present the first 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic sGRB simulations

jet+cocoon, cocoon, and neither. Typical sGRB jets break out of the dynamical
ejecta if (i) the bound ejecta's isotropic equivalent mass along the pole at
the time of the BH formation is $ \lesssim10^{-4}~{\rm M_{\odot}} $, setting a
limit on the delay time between the merger and BH formation, otherwise, the
jets perish inside the ejecta and leave the jet-inflated cocoon to power a
low-luminosity sGRB; (ii) the post-merger remnant disk contains strong
large-scale vertical magnetic field, $\gtrsim10^{15}$ G; and (iii) if the jets
are weak ($\lesssim10^{50}$ erg), the ejecta's isotropic equivalent mass along

structure is shaped by the early interaction with disk winds rather than the
dynamical ejecta. As long as our jets break out of the ejecta, they retain a
significant magnetization ($\lesssim1$), suggesting that magnetic reconnection
is a fundamental property of sGRB emission. The angular structure of the
outflow isotropic equivalent energy after breakout consistently features a flat
core followed by a steep power-law distribution (slope $\gtrsim3$), similar to
hydrodynamic jets. In the cocoon-only outcome, the dynamical ejecta broadens
the outflow angular distribution and flattens it (slope $\sim1.5$).

history. Recently it has been argued that in isolated binary evolution of two
massive stars the firstborn black hole is slowly rotating, whilst the
progenitor of the second-born black hole can be tidally spun up if the binary
is tight enough. Naively, one might therefore expect that only the less massive
black hole in merging binaries exhibits non-negligible spin. However, if the
mass ratio of the binary is ""reversed"" (typically during the first mass
transfer episode), it is possible for the tidally spun up second-born to become
the more massive black hole. We study the properties of such mass-ratio
reversed (MRR) binary black hole mergers using a large set of 560 population
synthesis models. We find that the more massive black hole is formed second in
$\gtrsim 70\%$ of binary black holes observable by LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA for
most model variations we consider, with typical total masses $\gtrsim 20$
M$_{\odot}$ and mass ratios $q = m_2 / m_1 \sim 0.7$ (where $m_1 > m_2$). The
formation history of these systems typically involves only stable mass transfer
episodes. The second-born black hole has non-negligible spin ($\chi > 0.05$) in
up to $25\%$ of binary black holes, with among those the more (less) massive
black hole spinning in $0\%$--$80\%$ ($20\%$--$100\%$) of cases, varying
greatly in our models. We discuss our models in the context of several observed

identified based on their optical and UV morphology and followed up with HI
observations with the VLA (and GBT), MUSE/VLT optical spectroscopy, and HST
imaging. These new data indicate that one system is a distant group of
galaxies. The remaining four are extremely low mass ($M_\ast \sim 10^5 \;
\mathrm{M_\odot}$), are dominated by young, blue stars, have highly irregular
and clumpy morphologies, are only a few kpc across, yet host an abundance of
metal-rich, $12 + \log (\mathrm{O/H}) > 8.2$, HII regions. These high
metallicities indicate that these stellar systems formed from gas stripped from
much more massive galaxies. Despite the young age of their stellar populations,
only one system is detected in HI, while the remaining three have minimal (if
any) gas reservoirs. Furthermore, two systems are surprisingly isolated and
have no plausible parent galaxy within $\sim$30' ($\sim$140 kpc). Although
tidal stripping cannot be conclusively excluded as the formation mechanism of
these objects, ram pressure stripping more naturally explains their properties,
in particular their isolation, owing to the higher velocities, relative to the
parent system, that can be achieved. Therefore, we posit that most of these
systems formed from ram pressure stripped gas removed from new infalling
cluster members, and survived in the intracluster medium long enough to become
separated from their parent galaxies by hundreds of kiloparsecs, and that they
thus represent a new type of stellar system.

after the enhancing feature and it is likely to continue with a second phase of

primordial spectrum from the second inflationary phase, even if its amplitude
is too small to directly induce detectable gravitational waves. This is
because, if there are sharp peaks in the primordial spectrum, the total
gravitational wave spectrum is not simply the sum of gravitational waves
induced by a peaked and scale-invariant primordial spectra separately, but
cross terms from interaction between these modes also become important. We also
find that such cross terms always have a characteristic slope. We discuss the

attractive solution to $\Delta a_\mu$ through a light pseudoscalar $A$, the

universality data in the $\tau$ and $Z$ decays. To save the model, we propose
that the light pseudoscalar be Higgs-phobic. Through the random scanning over
the entire parameter space, we perform a comparative study of the Higgs-phobic
type-X with and without the CDF $m_W$ measurement, called the CDF and PDG cases
respectively. Both cases can explain the two anomalies as well as all the other
constraints but have significant differences in the finally allowed parameter
space. For example, a small region with almost degenerate masses of new Higgs
bosons around 100 GeV is allowed only in the PDG case. The cutoff scale of the
model is also studied via the analysis of renormalization group equations,
which reaches up to $10^5~{\rm GeV}$ ($10^7~{\rm GeV}$) in the CDF (PDG) case.
Since the dominant decay modes are $A\to \tau\tau$, $H \to Z A$, and $H^\pm\to

hole doping has been controversial. To address this issue, we present an
experimental study of single-crystal and thin film samples of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with $x\ge0.25$. In particular, measurements of
bulk susceptibility on LSCO crystals with $x=0.25$ indicate an onset of
diamagnetism at $T_{c1}=38.5$ K, with a sharp transition to a phase with full
bulk shielding at $T_{c2}=18$ K, independent of field direction. Strikingly,
the in-plane resistivity only goes to zero at $T_{c2}$. Inelastic neutron
scattering on $x=0.25$ crystals confirms the presence of low-energy
incommensurate magnetic excitations with reduced strength compared to lower
doping levels. The ratio of the spin gap to $T_{c2}$ is anomalously large. Our
results are consistent with a theoretical prediction for strongly overdoped
cuprates by Spivak, Oreto, and Kivelson, in which superconductivity initially
develops within disconnected self-organized grains characterized by a reduced
hole concentration, with bulk superconductivity occurring only after
superconductivity is induced by proximity effect in the surrounding medium of
higher hole concentration. Beyond the superconducting-to-metal transition,
local differential conductance measurements on an LSCO thin film suggest that
regions with pairing correlations survive, but are too dilute to support
superconducting order. Future experiments will be needed to test the degree to
which these results apply to overdoped cuprates in general.

accelerates the merger course, and thereby introduces a phase shift in the

rotating stars, we provide an accurate, yet economical, method to generate
$f$-mode-involved, pre-merger waveforms using realistic spin-modulated $f$-mode
frequencies for some viable equations of state. We find for slow-rotating stars
that the dephasing effects of the dynamical tides can be uniquely,
EOS-independently determined by the direct observables (chirp mass ${\cal M}$,
symmetric ratio $\eta$ and the mutual tidal deformability ${\tilde \Lambda}$),
while this universality is gradually lost for increasing spin. For binaries
with fast rotating members ($\gtrsim800\text{ Hz}$) the phase shift due to
$f$-mode will exceed the uncertainty in the waveform phase at reasonable
signal-to-noise ($\rho=25$) and cutoff frequency of $\gtrsim400\text{ Hz}$.
Assuming a high cutoff frequency of $10^3\text{ Hz}$ and fast
($\gtrsim800\text{ Hz}$) members, a significant phase shift of $\gtrsim100$
rads has been found. For systems involving a rapidly-spinning star (potentially
the secondary of GW190814), neglecting $f$-mode effect in the waveform
templates can therefore lead to considerable systemic errors in the relevant
analysis. In particular, the dephasing due to $f$-mode is larger than that
caused by equilibrium tides by a factor of $\sim5$, which may lead to a
considerably overestimated tidal deformability if dynamical tidal contribution
is not accounted. The possibility of accompanying precursors flares due to
$f$-mode excitation is also discussed.

anomaly detection as detection of deviations from the learned normal patterns.
Previous works in the field (reconstruction or prediction-based methods) suffer
from two drawbacks: 1) They focus on low-level features, and they (especially
holistic approaches) do not effectively consider the object classes. 2)
Object-centric approaches neglect some of the context information (such as
location). To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-stream
object-aware VAD method that learns the normal appearance and motion patterns
through image translation tasks. The appearance branch translates the input
image to the target semantic segmentation map produced by Mask-RCNN, and the
motion branch associates each frame with its expected optical flow magnitude.
Any deviation from the expected appearance or motion in the inference stage
shows the degree of potential abnormality. We evaluated our proposed method on
the ShanghaiTech, UCSD-Ped1, and UCSD-Ped2 datasets and the results show
competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art works. Most importantly,
the results show that, as significant improvements to previous methods,
detections by our method are completely explainable and anomalies are localized

demonstrate that the cluster properties exhibit a strong dependence on the halo

in the electron pressure and density. Further, our work shows evidence for a
broken power-law mass dependence, with lower pressure in lower mass halos than
previous work and a strong evolution with mass of the radial correlations in
the electron density and pressure. Both of these effects highlight the
differing impact of active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback on the gas in
galaxy groups compared to massive clusters. We verified that we see
qualitatively similar features in the SIMBA hydro-dynamical simulations,
suggesting these effects could be generic features. Finally, we provide a
parametric formula for the electron pressure and density profile as a function
of dark matter halo mass, halo concentration, and redshift. These fitting
formulae can reproduce the distribution of density and pressure of clusters and
will be useful in extracting cosmological information from upcoming CMB

the average treatment effect, a baseline prognostic index of risk (PI), the
shape of its interaction with treatment (none, linear, quadratic or
non-monotonic), and the magnitude of treatment-related harms (none or constant
independent of the PI). We predicted absolute benefit using: models with a
constant relative treatment effect; stratification in quarters of the PI;
models including a linear interaction of treatment with the PI; models
including an interaction of treatment with a restricted cubic spline (RCS)
transformation of the PI; an adaptive approach using Akaike's Information
Criterion. We evaluated predictive performance using root mean squared error
and measures of discrimination and calibration for benefit. Results: The
linear-interaction model displayed optimal or close-to-optimal performance
across many simulation scenarios with moderate sample size (N=4,250 patients; ~
785 events). The RCS-model was optimal for strong non-linear deviations from a
constant treatment effect, particularly when sample size was larger (N=17,000).
The adaptive approach also required larger sample sizes. These findings were
illustrated in the GUSTO-I trial. Conclusion: An interaction between baseline
risk and treatment assignment should be considered to improve treatment effect
predictions.

tasks, is generally less favored in the field of video recognition. By
contrast, a common strategy is to directly train with spatiotemporal
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch. Nonetheless, interestingly,
by taking a closer look at these from-scratch learned CNNs, we note there exist
certain 3D kernels that exhibit much stronger appearance modeling ability than
others, arguably suggesting appearance information is already well disentangled
in learning. Inspired by this observation, we hypothesize that the key to
effectively leveraging image pre-training lies in the decomposition of learning
spatial and temporal features, and revisiting image pre-training as the
appearance prior to initializing 3D kernels. In addition, we propose
Spatial-Temporal Separable (STS) convolution, which explicitly splits the
feature channels into spatial and temporal groups, to further enable a more
thorough decomposition of spatiotemporal features for fine-tuning 3D CNNs. Our
experiments show that simply replacing 3D convolution with STS notably improves
a wide range of 3D CNNs without increasing parameters and computation on both
Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2. Moreover, this new training pipeline
consistently achieves better results on video recognition with significant
speedup. For instance, we achieve +0.6% top-1 of Slowfast on Kinetics-400 over
the strong 256-epoch 128-GPU baseline while fine-tuning for only 50 epochs with

  submission: see paper for full abstract. Updated to acknowledge additional
  funding",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The \emph{$ p$-processor cup game} is a classic and widely studied scheduling
problem that captures the setting in which a $p$-processor machine must assign
tasks to processors over time in order to ensure that no individual task ever
falls too far behind. The problem is formalized as a multi-round game in which
two players, a filler (who assigns work to tasks) and an emptier (who schedules
tasks) compete. The emptier's goal is to minimize backlog, which is the maximum
amount of outstanding work for any task.
  Recently, Kuszmaul and Westover (ITCS, 2021) proposed the
\emph{variable-processor cup game}, which considers the same problem, except
that the amount of resources available to the players (i.e., the number $p$ of
processors) fluctuates between rounds of the game. They showed that this
seemingly small modification fundamentally changes the dynamics of the game:
whereas the optimal backlog in the fixed $p$-processor game is $\Theta(\log
n)$, independent of $p$, the optimal backlog in the variable-processor game is
$\Theta(n)$. The latter result was only known to apply to games with
\emph{exponentially many} rounds, however, and it has remained an open question
what the optimal tradeoff between time and backlog is for shorter games.
  This paper establishes a tight trade-off curve between time and backlog in
the variable-processor cup game. Importantly, we prove that for a game
consisting of $t$ rounds, the optimal backlog is $\Theta(n)$ if and only if $t
\ge \Omega(n^3)$. Our techniques also allow for us to resolve several other
open questions concerning how the variable-processor cup game behaves in
beyond-worst-case-analysis settings.

treating the CQE algorithm as an optimization in a local parameter space, we

clusters, most notably from {\it Hitomi}. Turbulence is often invoked to offset
radiative losses in cluster cores, both by direct dissipation and by enabling
turbulent heat diffusion. However, in a stratified medium, buoyancy forces
oppose radial motions, making turbulence anisotropic. This can be quantified
via the Froude number ${\rm Fr}$, which decreases inward in clusters as
stratification increases. We exploit analogies with MHD turbulence to show that
wave-turbulence interactions increase cascade times and reduces dissipation
rates $\epsilon \propto {\rm Fr}$. Equivalently, for a given energy
injection/dissipation rate $\epsilon$, turbulent velocities $u$ must be higher
compared to Kolmogorov scalings. High resolution hydrodynamic simulations show
excellent agreement with the $\epsilon \propto {\rm Fr}$ scaling, which sets in
for ${\rm Fr} < 0.1$. We also compare previously predicted scalings for the
turbulent diffusion coefficient $D \propto {\rm Fr}^2$ and find excellent
agreement, for ${\rm Fr} < 1$. However, we find a different normalization,
corresponding to stronger diffusive suppression by more than an order of
magnitude. Our results imply that turbulent diffusion is more heavily
suppressed by stratification, over a much wider radial range, than turbulent
dissipation. Thus, the latter potentially dominates. Furthermore, this shift
implies significantly higher turbulent velocities required to offset cooling,
compared to previous models. These results are potentially relevant to
turbulent metal diffusion (which is likewise suppressed), and to planetary
atmospheres.

extended chemical evolution. The most metal-rich star has strikingly low
[Sc/Fe] = $-1.29 \pm 0.48$ and [Mn/Fe] = $-1.33 \pm 0.33$, implying significant

single population plays an important role in time-to-event analysis. Cox
regression is commonly used to estimate the hazard ratio under the assumption
that it is constant in time, which is known as the proportional hazards
assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in practice, and when it
is violated, the parameter estimated by Cox regression is difficult to
interpret. The hazard ratio can be estimated in a nonparametric manner using
smoothing, but smoothing-based estimators are sensitive to the selection of
tuning parameters, and it is often difficult to perform valid inference with
such estimators. In some cases, it is known that the hazard ratio function is
monotone. In this article, we demonstrate that monotonicity of the hazard ratio
function defines an invariant stochastic order, and we study the properties of
this order. Furthermore, we introduce an estimator of the hazard ratio function
under a monotonicity constraint. We demonstrate that our estimator converges in
distribution to a mean-zero limit, and we use this result to construct
asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Finally, we conduct numerical

compelling evidence for recent nearby supernova explosions within $\sim 100$ pc

effect on the heliosphere. We perform new calculations to study the compression
of the heliosphere due to a supernova blast. Assuming a steady but
non-isotropic solar wind, we explore a range of properties appropriate for
supernova distances inspired by recent 60Fe data, and for a 20 pc supernova
proposed to account for mass extinctions at the end-Devonian period. We examine
the locations of the termination shock decelerating the solar wind and the
heliopause that marks the boundary between the solar wind and supernova
material. Pressure balance scaling holds, consistent with studies of other
astrospheres. Solar wind anisotropy does not have an appreciable effect on
shock geometry. We find that supernova explosions at 50 pc (95 pc) lead to
heliopause locations at 16 au (23 au) when the forward shock arrives. Thus, the
outer solar system was directly exposed to the blast, but the inner planets --
including the Earth -- were not. This finding reaffirms that the delivery of
supernova material to the Earth is not from the blast plasma itself, but likely
is from supernova dust grains. After the arrival of the forward shock, the
weakening supernova blast will lead to a gradual rebound of the heliosphere,
taking $\sim100$s of kyr to expand beyond 100 au. Prospects for future work are

the double-diffusive processes taking place in such a stable layer, considering
the case of Mercury's core where the temperature gradient is stable but the
composition gradient is unstable over a 800km-thick layer. The large difference
in the molecular diffusivities leads to the development of buoyancy-driven
instabilities that drive radial flows known as fingering convection. We model
fingering convection using hydrodynamical simulations in a rotating spherical
shell and varying the rotation rate and the stratification strength. For small
Rayleigh numbers (i.e. weak background temperature and composition gradients),
fingering convection takes the form of columnar flows aligned with the rotation
axis and with an azimuthal size comparable with the layer thickness. For larger
Rayleigh numbers, the flows retain a columnar structure but the azimuthal size
is drastically reduced leading to thin sheet-like structures that are elongated
in the meridional direction. The azimuthal length decreases when the thermal
stratification increases, following closely the scaling law expected from the
linear non-rotating planar theory (Stern, 1960). We find that the radial flows
always remain laminar with local Reynolds number of order 1-10.
Equatorially-symmetric zonal flows form due to latitudinal variations of the
axisymmetric composition. The zonal velocity exceeds the non-axisymmetric
velocities at the largest Rayleigh numbers. We discuss plausible implications

first try to rephrase, then simplify, before giving up. Next, to incorporate
the observed reformulation behavior in a user simulator, we introduce the task
of reformulation sequence generation: to generate a sequence of reformulated
utterances with a given intent (rephrase or simplify). We develop methods by
extending transformer models guided by the reformulation type and perform
further filtering based on estimated reading difficulty. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using both automatic and human evaluation.

narrow composition range of Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$TbIrO$_6$. The valence-state
transition involves an electron transfer between Tb and Ir leading to the
valence-state change between Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ and Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$
phases. This first-order transition has a dramatic effect on the lattice,
transport properties, and the long-range magnetic order at low temperatures for
both Tb and Ir ions. Ir$^{5+}$ ion has an electronic configuration of 5$d^4$
($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) which is expected to be nonmagnetic. In contrast, Ir$^{4+}$
ion with a configuration of 5$d^5$($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) favors a long-range
magnetic order. For $x$ = 0.1 with Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ configuration to the
lowest temperature (2 K) investigated in this work, a spin-glass behavior is
observed around 5 K indicating Ir$^{5+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) ions act as a
spacer reducing the magnetic interactions between Tb$^{3+}$ ions. For $x$ = 0.5
with Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ configuration below the highest temperature 400 K of
this work, a long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T\rm_N$ = 40 K is observed
highlighting the importance of Ir$^{4+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) ions in promoting
the long-range magnetic order of both Tb and Ir ions. For 0.2 $\leqslant x
\leqslant$ 0.375, a temperature-induced valence-state transition from
high-temperature Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ phase to low-temperature
Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ phase occurs in the temperature range 180 K $\leqslant T
\leqslant$ 325 K and the transition temperature increases with $x$. The
compositional dependence demonstrates the ability to tune the the valence state
for a critical region of $x$ that leads to a concurrent change in magnetism and
structure. This tuning ability could be employed with suitable strain in thin
films to act as a switch as the magnetism is manipulated.

the objective function $F$ is a composition of a convex function $f$ and a

gradient-based algorithms and establish their sample and gradient complexities
for achieving an $\epsilon$-global optimal solution. Interestingly, our
proposed Mirror Stochastic Gradient (MSG) method operates only in the original
$x$-space using gradient estimators of the original nonconvex objective $F$ and
achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample and gradient complexities,
which matches the lower bounds for solving stochastic convex optimization
problems. Under booking limits control, we formulate the air-cargo network
revenue management (NRM) problem with random two-dimensional capacity, random
consumption, and routing flexibility as a special case of the stochastic
nonconvex optimization, where the random function $\phi(x,\xi)=x\wedge\xi$,
i.e., the random demand $\xi$ truncates the booking limit decision $x$.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our

protoplanetary disks offer an opportunity to study the vertical distribution of
CO emission and temperature. The asymmetry of line emission relative to the
disk major axis allows for a direct mapping of the emission height above the
midplane, and for optically-thick, spatially-resolved emission in LTE, the
intensity is a measure of the local gas temperature. Our analysis of ALMA
archival data yields CO emission surfaces, dynamically-constrained stellar host
masses, and disk atmosphere gas temperatures for the disks around: HD 142666,
MY Lup, V4046 Sgr, HD 100546, GW Lup, WaOph 6, DoAr 25, Sz 91, CI Tau, and DM
Tau. These sources span a wide range in stellar masses (0.50-2.10 M$_{\odot}$),
ages (${\sim}$0.3-23 Myr), and CO gas radial emission extents
(${\approx}$200-1000 au). This sample nearly triples the number of disks with
mapped emission surfaces and confirms the wide diversity in line emitting
heights ($z/r\approx0.1$ to ${\gtrsim}0.5$) hinted at in previous studies. We
compute radial and vertical CO gas temperature distributions for each disk. A
few disks show local temperature dips or enhancements, some of which correspond
to dust substructures or the proposed locations of embedded planets. Several
emission surfaces also show vertical substructures, which all align with rings
and gaps in the millimeter dust. Combining our sample with literature sources,
we find that CO line emitting heights weakly decline with stellar mass and gas
temperature, which, despite large scatter, is consistent with simple scaling
relations. We also observe a correlation between CO emission height and disk
size, which is due to the flared structure of disks. Overall, CO emission
surfaces trace ${\approx}2$-$5\times$ gas pressure scale heights (H$_{\rm{g}}$)
and could potentially be calibrated as empirical tracers of H$_{\rm{g}}$.

exhibit significant variations in shape and size. Even though the U-Net already
possesses some capability to analyze features at various scales, we propose to
explicitly add multi-scale feature maps in each convolutional module of the

accuracy of a U-Net model also suffers when the annotations for supervised
learning are noisy or incomplete. This can happen due to the inherent
difficulty for a human expert to identify and delineate all instances of
specific pathology very precisely and accurately. We address this challenge by
introducing auxiliary confidence maps that emphasize less on the boundaries of
the given target regions. Further, we utilize the bootstrapping properties of
the deep network to address the missing annotation problem intelligently. In
our experiments on a private dataset of breast cancer lymph nodes, where the
primary task was to segment germinal centres and sinus histiocytosis, we
observed substantial improvement over a U-Net baseline based on the two

fixed point theorem we obtain a sequence $\{\psi^{(h)}\}_{h\in\mathbb{N}_0}$
converging uniformly to $\psi$ in every compact time interval; if $\omega$
varies slowly or little, already $\psi^{(0)}$ approximates $\psi$ well for
rather long time lapses. The discontinuities of $\omega$, if any, determine
those of $\psi,{\cal I}$. The zeroes of $q,\dot q$ are investigated with the
help of two Riccati equations. As a demo of the potential of our approach, we
briefly argue that it yields good approximations of the solutions (as well as
exact bounds on them) and thereby may simplify the study of: the stability of
the trivial one; the occurrence of parametric resonance when $\omega(t)$ is
periodic; the adiabatic invariance of ${\cal I}$; the asymptotic expansions in
a slow time parameter $\varepsilon$; etc.

The heterogeneous models were made of a memristive 2D (HR) and the traditional
3D HR neurons. Investigating a model of two coupled neurons through an
electrical synapse reveals dissipative properties. When control parameters are
varied, the coupled neuron model exhibits rich dynamics, such as the periodic,
quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics involving either bursting or spiking
oscillations. For weak electrical coupling strength, non-synchronized motion is
observed. But in the case of higher coupling strength, synchronized cluster
states are observed. Besides, ring-star networks of up to 100 under three
different heterogeneous topologies are being investigated, and various
spatiotemporal patterns are explored. It is found that the spatiotemporal
patterns depend on the topology of the heterogeneous network considered. A new
clustered chimera state is revealed qualitatively via the recurrence plot. The
cluster states are indicated in the ring and star configurations of the
heterogeneous network. Single and double-well chimera states have been revealed
in the ring and ring-star structures. Finally, an equivalent electronic circuit
for the two coupled heterogeneous is designed and investigated in the PSIM

obtained from the designed analog circuit and the mathematical model of the two
coupled neurons, which supports the fact that our obtained results are not

the adversarial target. How should the meta-cognitive radar choose its
responses to sufficiently confuse the adversary trying to estimate the radar's
utility function? This paper abstracts the radar's meta-cognition problem in
terms of the spectra (eigenvalues) of the state and observation noise
covariance matrices, and embeds the algebraic Riccati equation into an
economics-based utility maximization setup. This adversarial target is an
inverse reinforcement learner. By observing a noisy sequence of radar's
responses (waveforms), the adversarial target uses a statistical hypothesis
test to detect if the radar is a utility maximizer. In turn, the meta-cognitive
radar deliberately chooses sub-optimal responses that increasing its Type-I
error probability of the adversary's detector. We call this counter-adversarial
step taken by the meta-cognitive radar as inverse inverse reinforcement

mechanisms that can deliver transactions to most network nodes with low
bandwidth overhead and latency. Existing schemes coordinate transmissions
across peers to avoid sending redundant data, but they either incur a high
latency or are not robust against adversarial network nodes. We present
Strokkur, a new transaction broadcasting mechanism that provides both low
bandwidth overhead and low latency. The core idea behind Strokkur is to avoid
explicit coordination through randomized transaction coding. Rather than
forward individual transactions. Strokkur nodes send out codewords -- XOR sums
of multiple transactions selected at random. Since almost every codeword is
useful for the receiver to decode new transactions, Strokkur nodes do not
require coordination, for example, to determine which transactions the receiver
is missing. Strokkur's coding strategy builds on LT codes, a popular class of
rateless erasure codes, and extends them to support multiple uncoordinated
senders with partially-overlapping continual streams of transaction data.
Strokkur introduces mechanisms to cope with adversarial senders that may send
corrupt codewords, and a simple rate control algorithm that enables each node
to independently determine an appropriate sending rate of codewords for each
peer. Our implementation of Strokkur in Golang supports 647k transactions per
second using only one CPU core. Our evaluation across a 19-node Internet
deployment and large-scale simulation show that Strokkur consumes 2--7.6x less
bandwidth than the existing scheme in Bitcoin, and 9x lower latency that Shrec

the SNR reverse shock is interacting with the PWN and has most likely shocked
the majority of supernova ejecta. In our models, such a scenario requires a
total ejecta mass of $\lesssim 3\: \rm M_{\odot}$ and implies that there is no
significant quantity of cold ejecta in the interior of the reverse shock. In
light of these results, we compare the estimated elemental masses and abundance
ratios in the reverse-shocked ejecta to nucleosynthesis models and find that
they are consistent with a progenitor star with an initial mass of 12-16 $\:

when footsteps are constrained to stepping stones. While recent work has shown
progress on this problem, real-world demonstrations have been limited to
relatively simple open-loop, perception-free scenarios. Our main contribution
is a more advanced learning approach that enables real-world demonstrations,
using the Cassie robot, of closed-loop dynamic walking over moderately
difficult stepping-stone patterns. Our approach first uses reinforcement
learning (RL) in simulation to train a controller that maps footstep commands
onto joint actions without any reference motion information. We then learn a
model of that controller's capabilities, which enables prediction of feasible
footsteps given the robot's current dynamic state. The resulting controller and
model are then integrated with a real-time overhead camera system for detecting
stepping stone locations. For evaluation, we develop a benchmark set of
stepping stone patterns, which are used to test performance in both simulation
and the real world. Overall, we demonstrate that sim-to-real learning is
extremely promising for enabling dynamic locomotion over stepping stones. We
also identify challenges remaining that motivate important future research
directions.

are capable of reasoning through the generation of natural language
explanations. However, the methodologies to design and evaluate
explanation-based inference models are still poorly informed by theoretical
accounts on the nature of explanation. As an attempt to provide an
epistemologically grounded characterisation for XAI, this paper focuses on the
scientific domain, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice on the
notion of a scientific explanation. Specifically, the paper combines a detailed
survey of the modern accounts of scientific explanation in Philosophy of
Science with a systematic analysis of corpora of natural language explanations,
clarifying the nature and function of explanatory arguments from both a
top-down (categorical) and a bottom-up (corpus-based) perspective. Through a
mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, the presented study
allows deriving the following main conclusions: (1) Explanations cannot be
entirely characterised in terms of inductive or deductive arguments as their
main function is to perform unification; (2) An explanation must cite causes
and mechanisms that are responsible for the occurrence of the event to be
explained; (3) While natural language explanations possess an intrinsic
causal-mechanistic nature, they are not limited to causes and mechanisms, also
accounting for pragmatic elements such as definitions, properties and taxonomic
relations; (4) Patterns of unification naturally emerge in corpora of
explanations even if not intentionally modelled; (5) Unification is realised
through a process of abstraction, whose function is to provide the inference
substrate for subsuming the event to be explained under recurring patterns and
high-level regularities.

undersampling, geometric transformations, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and
generative adversarial networks (GANs). We then trained a classifier for each

performance to the state-of-the-art attribute classifier trained on the

the model on StarGAN-generated images led to the best overall performance. We
also found that training on geometrically transformed images lead to a similar

ranging from astrophysical to laboratory plasmas and have primarily been
studied using fluid models, the majority of which have been ideal fluid models.
This work is the first of its kind to present a 5-dimensional (2 spatial
dimensions, 3 velocity space dimensions) simulation using the continuum-kinetic
model to study the effect of the collisional mean-free-path and transport on
the instability growth. The continuum-kinetic model provides noise-free access
to the full particle distribution function permitting a detailed investigation
of the role of kinetic physics in hydrodynamic phenomena such as the RT
instability. For long mean-free-path, there is no RT instability growth, but as
collisionality increases, particles relax towards the Maxwellian velocity
distribution, and the kinetic simulations reproduce the fluid simulation
results. An important and novel contribution of this work is in the
intermediate collisional cases that are not accessible with traditional fluid
models and require kinetic modeling. Simulations of intermediate collisional
cases show that the RT instability evolution is significantly altered compared
to the highly collisional fluid-like cases. Specifically, the growth rate of
the intermediate collisionality RT instability is lower than the high
collisionality case while also producing a significantly more diffused
interface. The higher moments of the distribution function play a more
significant role relative to inertial terms for intermediate collisionality
during the evolution of the RT instability interface. Particle energy-flux is
calculated from moments of the distribution and shows that transport is
significantly altered in the intermediate collisional case and deviates much
more so from the high collisionality limit of the fluid regime.

times the virial radius and $1.7 - 3$ times the splashback radius, in line with
an approximately universal outer density profile, and the average enclosed
density within the characteristic depletion radius is found to be roughly $29$

context into semantic categories such as relations, entity types, and event
types. The inferred labels of semantic categories meaningfully interpret how
machines understand components of text. In this paper, we present UniST, a
unified framework for semantic typing that captures label semantics by
projecting both inputs and labels into a joint semantic embedding space. To
formulate different lexical and relational semantic typing tasks as a unified
task, we incorporate task descriptions to be jointly encoded with the input,
allowing UniST to be adapted to different tasks without introducing
task-specific model components. UniST optimizes a margin ranking loss such that
the semantic relatedness of the input and labels is reflected from their
embedding similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that UniST achieves strong
performance across three semantic typing tasks: entity typing, relation
classification and event typing. Meanwhile, UniST effectively transfers
semantic knowledge of labels and substantially improves generalizability on
inferring rarely seen and unseen types. In addition, multiple semantic typing
tasks can be jointly trained within the unified framework, leading to a single
compact multi-tasking model that performs comparably to dedicated single-task
models, while offering even better transferability.

  species",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Plasmodium (P.) falciparum and P. vivax are the two most common causes of
malaria. While the majority of deaths and severe morbidity are due to P.
falciparum, P. vivax poses a greater challenge to eliminating malaria outside
of Africa due to its ability to form latent liver stage parasites
(hypnozoites), which can cause relapsing episodes within an individual patient.
In areas where P. falciparum and P. vivax are co-endemic, individuals can carry
parasites of both species simultaneously. These mixed infections complicate
dynamics in several ways; treatment of mixed infections will simultaneously
affect both species, P. falciparum can mask the detection of P. vivax, and it
has been hypothesised that clearing P. falciparum may trigger a relapse of
dormant P. vivax. When mixed infections are treated for only blood-stage
parasites, patients are at risk of relapse infections due to P. vivax
hypnozoites.
  We present a stochastic mathematical model that captures interactions between
P. falciparum and P. vivax, and incorporates both standard schizontocidal
treatment (which targets blood-stage parasites) and radical treatment (which
additionally targets liver-stage parasites). We apply this model to assess the
implications of different treatment coverage of radical cure for mixed and P.
vivax infections and a so-called ""unified radical cure"" treatment strategy for
P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infections. We find that a unified radical
cure strategy, with G6PD screening, leads to a substantially lower incidence of
malaria cases and deaths overall. We perform a one-way sensitivity analysis to

relax this assumption, in this work, we propose a label-agnostic unified
federated learning framework, named FedMix, for medical image segmentation

by integrating and effectively making use of all available labeled data ranging
from strong pixel-level labels, weak bounding box labels, to weakest
image-level class labels. Based on these local models, we further propose an
adaptive weight assignment procedure across local clients, where each client
learns an aggregation weight during the global model update. Compared to the
existing methods, FedMix not only breaks through the constraint of a single
level of image supervision, but also can dynamically adjust the aggregation
weight of each local client, achieving rich yet discriminative feature
representations. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments have been carried
out on two challenging medical image segmentation tasks, i.e., breast tumor
segmentation and skin lesion segmentation. The results validate that our
proposed FedMix outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin.

$\sigma^2 \gtrsim K$, the rate scales as $\sigma^6$ and has no further
dependence on the dimension. This rate is achieved by a bispectrum inversion
procedure, and our analyses provide new stability bounds for bispectrum
inversion that may be of independent interest. In a low-noise regime where
$\sigma^2 \lesssim K/\log K$, the rate scales instead as $K\sigma^2$, and we
establish this rate by a sharp analysis of the maximum likelihood estimator
that marginalizes over latent rotations. A complementary lower bound that
interpolates between these two regimes is obtained using Assouad's hypercube
lemma.

various use cases including environmental monitoring. A typical example is
underwater acoustic communication for 6G mobile networks. The major challenges
in such environments are extremely high-latency and high-error rate. They make
real-time image transmission difficult using existing communication protocols.
This is partly because frequent retransmission in noisy networks increases
latency and leads to serious deterioration of real-timeness. To address this
problem, this paper proposes a stochastic image transmission with Constrained
Application Protocol (CoAP) for extreme environments. The goal of the proposed
idea is to achieve approximate real-time image transmission without
retransmission using CoAP over UDP. To this end, an image is divided into
blocks, and value is assigned for each block based on the requirement. By the
stochastic transmission of blocks, the reception probability is guaranteed
without retransmission even when packets are lost in networks. We implemented
the proposed scheme using Raspberry Pi 4 to demonstrate the feasibility. The
performance of the proposed image transmission was confirmed from the
experimental results.

continuous workflow of various tasks that have dynamic resource demands.
Serverless computing is an emerging cloud paradigm that provides transparent
resource management and scaling for users and has the potential to
revolutionize the routine of ML design and training. However, hosting modern ML
workflows on existing serverless platforms has non-trivial challenges due to
their intrinsic design limitations such as stateless nature, limited
communication support across function instances, and limited function execution
duration. These limitations result in a lack of an overarching view and
adaptation mechanism for training dynamics and an amplification of existing
problems in ML workflows.
  To address the above challenges, we propose SMLT, an automated, scalable, and
adaptive serverless framework to enable efficient and user-centric ML design
and training. SMLT employs an automated and adaptive scheduling mechanism to
dynamically optimize the deployment and resource scaling for ML tasks during
training. SMLT further enables user-centric ML workflow execution by supporting
user-specified training deadlines and budget limits. In addition, by providing
an end-to-end design, SMLT solves the intrinsic problems in serverless
platforms such as the communication overhead, limited function execution
duration, need for repeated initialization, and also provides explicit fault
tolerance for ML training. SMLT is open-sourced and compatible with all major
ML frameworks. Our experimental evaluation with large, sophisticated modern ML

nonlinear stochastic difference equations and propose robust abstractions for
verifying probabilistic linear temporal specifications. The current literature
focuses on developing sound abstraction techniques for stochastic dynamics
without perturbations. However, soundness thus far has only been shown for
preserving the satisfaction probability of certain types of temporal-logic
specification. We present constructive finite-state abstractions for verifying
probabilistic satisfaction of general {\omega}-regular linear-time properties
of more general nonlinear stochastic systems. Instead of imposing stability
assumptions, we analyze the probabilistic properties from the topological view
of metrizable space of probability measures. Such abstractions are both sound
and approximately complete. That is, given a concrete discrete-time stochastic
system and an arbitrarily small L1-perturbation of this system, there exists a
family of finite-state Markov chains whose set of satisfaction probabilities
contains that of the original system and meanwhile is contained by that of the
slightly perturbed system. A direct consequence is that, given a probabilistic
linear-time specification, initializing within the winning/losing region of the
abstraction system can guarantee a satisfaction/dissatisfaction for the
original system. We make an interesting observation that, unlike the
deterministic case, point-mass (Dirac) perturbations cannot fulfill the purpose

data analytic challenges appear since test profiles vary between medical
practitioners, resulting in missing data. In this study we provide an
analytical investigation of the laboratory diagnosis of Hepatitis C (HCV)
infection and focus on how to maximize the predictive value of routine
pathology data. We recommend using the Influx - Outflux measures to help
construct the imputation model when using multiple imputation.
  Data from 14,320 community-patients aged 15 - 100 years were accessed via ACT
Pathology (The Canberra Hospital, Australia). Influx and Outflux were
calculated to identify which variables were potentially powerful predictors of
missing values. Available Case analysis and Multiple Imputation were used to
accommodate missing values in the dataset. Logistic regression model and
stepwise selection method were used for analysing the imputed datasets. The
predictive power of all methods was compared.
  The predictive power of the models on multiply imputed data was similar to
the power of the models based on complete data. The advantage of multiply
imputed data was that it allowed for the inclusion of all the completed
variables in the logistic models, thus identifying a broader selection of test
results that could lead to the enhanced laboratory prediction of HCV.
  Multiple imputation is an important statistical resource allowing all
individuals in a study to contribute whatever data they have supplied to the
analysis. MI in combination with the values of Influx and Outflux identifies
potential predictors of HepC infection. Variables age, gender and alanine
aminotransferase have been shown to be strong laboratory predictors of HCV
infection.

brain stimulation technique used to generate conduction currents in the head
and disrupt brain functions. To rapidly evaluate the tDCS-induced current
density in near real-time, this paper proposes a deep learning-based emulator,
named DeeptDCS. Methods: The emulator leverages Attention U-net taking the
volume conductor models (VCMs) of head tissues as inputs and outputting the
three-dimensional current density distribution across the entire head. The
electrode configurations are also incorporated into VCMs without increasing the
number of input channels; this enables the straightforward incorporation of the
non-parametric features of electrodes (e.g., thickness, shape, size, and
position) in the training and testing of the proposed emulator. Results:
Attention U-net outperforms standard U-net and its other three variants
(Residual U-net, Attention Residual U-net, and Multi-scale Residual U-net) in
terms of accuracy. The generalization ability of DeeptDCS to non-trained
electrode configurations can be greatly enhanced through fine-tuning the model.
The computational time required by one emulation via DeeptDCS is a fraction of
a second. Conclusion: DeeptDCS is at least two orders of magnitudes faster than
a physics-based open-source simulator, while providing satisfactorily accurate
results. Significance: The high computational efficiency permits the use of
DeeptDCS in applications requiring its repetitive execution, such as
uncertainty quantification and optimization studies of tDCS.

known to undergo a phase transition from a single-filament state to a bundled

concentration. While the depletion interaction experienced by these biopolymers
is well-known, the effect of changing the molecular weight of the depletant is
less well understood. Here, we experimentally identify a phase transition in

terms of micro and macroscale properties. We find that the mesh size, bundle
diameter, persistence length, and intra-bundle spacing between filaments across

relaxation time, storage modulus, and degree of bundling change between the two

exposure could assist each other through social ties. Heterophily is the
tendency of unlike individuals to form social ties. Conversely, populations in
spatial areas with significant hazard exposure similarity, homophily, would
lack sufficient resourcefulness to aid each other to lessen the impact of
hazards. In the context of the Houston metropolitan area, we use Meta's Social
Connectedness data to construct a socio-spatial network in juxtaposition with
flood exposure data from National Flood Hazard Layer to analyze flood hazard
exposure of spatial areas. The results reveal the extent and spatial variation
of hazard-exposure heterophily in the study area. Notably, the results show
that lower-income areas have lower hazard-exposure heterophily possibly caused
by income segregation and the tendency of affordable housing development to be
located in flood zones. Less resourceful social ties due to high
hazard-exposure homophily may inhibit low-income areas from better coping with
hazard impacts and could contribute to their slower recovery. Overall, the
results underscore the significance of characterizing hazard-exposure
heterophily in socio-spatial networks to reveal community vulnerability and
resilience to hazards.

wave signals has potential to shed light on a range of applications, such as
inferring the dynamical and geometric properties of a moving vessel based on
the surface elevation data detected at a single point in space. We continue
this line of research here with a study of mathematical models for thin ships
using standard Wigley hulls and Wigley transom-stern hulls as examples.
Mathematical models of varying sophistication are considered. These include
basic minimal models which use applied pressure distributions as proxies for
the ship hull. The more complicated models are Michell's thin ship theory and
the Hogner model, both of which explicitly take into account the shape of the
hull. We outline a methodology for carefully choosing the form and parameter
values in the minimal models such that they reproduce the key features of the
more complicated models in the time-frequency domain. For example, we find that
a two-pressure model is capable of producing wave elevation signals that have a
similar time-frequency profile as that for Michell's thin ship theory applied
to the Wigley hull, including the crucially important features caused by
interference between waves created at the bow and stern of the ship. One of the
key tools in our analysis is the spectrogram, which is a heat-map visualisation
in the time-frequency domain. Our work here extends the existing knowledge on
the topic of spectrograms of ship waves. The theoretical results in this study
are supported by experimental data collected in a towing tank at the Australian

it brings the well-known domain shift problem. From a different yet new
perspective, this paper explores contrastive learning with an adversarial
training effort to leverage unpaired real-world hazy and clean images, thus
bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world haze is avoided. We propose
an effective unsupervised contrastive learning paradigm for image dehazing,
dubbed UCL-Dehaze. Unpaired real-world clean and hazy images are easily
captured, and will serve as the important positive and negative samples
respectively when training our UCL-Dehaze network. To train the network more
effectively, we formulate a new self-contrastive perceptual loss function,
which encourages the restored images to approach the positive samples and keep
away from the negative samples in the embedding space. Besides the overall
network architecture of UCL-Dehaze, adversarial training is utilized to align
the distributions between the positive samples and the dehazed images. Compared
with recent image dehazing works, UCL-Dehaze does not require paired data
during training and utilizes unpaired positive/negative data to better enhance
the dehazing performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our
UCL-Dehaze and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-arts, even

order to deal with this issue, several temporal knowledge graph embedding
(TKGE) approaches have been proposed to integrate temporal and structural
information in recent years. However, these methods only employ a uniformly
random sampling to construct negative facts. As a consequence, the corrupted
samples are often too simplistic for training an effective model. In this
paper, we propose a new temporal knowledge graph embedding framework by
introducing adversarial learning to further refine the performance of
traditional TKGE models. In our framework, a generator is utilized to construct
high-quality plausible quadruples and a discriminator learns to obtain the
embeddings of entities and relations based on both positive and negative
samples. Meanwhile, we also apply a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the
Wasserstein distance to prevent vanishing gradient problems on discrete data;
an inherent flaw in traditional generative adversarial networks. Through

traditionally performed prior to compression. However, there are applications
where image noise may be necessary to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the
image, such as court evidence and image forensics. This means that noise itself
needs to be coded, in addition to the clean image itself. In this paper, we
present a learning-based image compression framework where image denoising and
compression are performed jointly. The latent space of the image codec is
organized in a scalable manner such that the clean image can be decoded from a
subset of the latent space (the base layer), while the noisy image is decoded
from the full latent space at a higher rate. Using a subset of the latent space
for the denoised image allows denoising to be carried out at a lower rate.
Besides providing a scalable representation of the noisy input image,
performing denoising jointly with compression makes intuitive sense because
noise is hard to compress; hence, compressibility is one of the criteria that
may help distinguish noise from the signal. The proposed codec is compared
against established compression and denoising benchmarks, and the experiments
reveal considerable bitrate savings compared to a cascade combination of a
state-of-the-art codec and a state-of-the-art denoiser.

feature-dependent price sensitivity. Developing practical algorithms that can
estimate price elasticities robustly, especially when information about no
purchases (losses) is not available, to drive such automated pricing systems is
a challenge faced by many industries. Based on the Poisson semi-parametric
approach, we construct a flexible yet interpretable demand model where the
price related part is parametric while the remaining (nuisance) part of the
model is non-parametric and can be modeled via sophisticated machine learning
(ML) techniques. The estimation of price-sensitivity parameters of this model
via direct one-stage regression techniques may lead to biased estimates due to
regularization. To address this concern, we propose a two-stage estimation
methodology which makes the estimation of the price-sensitivity parameters
robust to biases in the estimators of the nuisance parameters of the model. In
the first-stage we construct estimators of observed purchases and prices given
the feature vector using sophisticated ML estimators such as deep neural
networks. Utilizing the estimators from the first-stage, in the second-stage we
leverage a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the
price-sensitivity parameters. We test the performance of the proposed
estimation schemes on simulated and real sales transaction data from the
Airline industry. Our numerical studies demonstrate that our proposed two-stage
approach reduces the estimation error in price-sensitivity parameters from 25\%
to 4\% in realistic simulation settings. The two-stage estimation techniques
proposed in this work allows practitioners to leverage modern ML techniques to
robustly estimate price-sensitivities while still maintaining interpretability

with confinement respectively. Then performing the potential analysis, we find
due to the anisotropy, the potential barrier behaves oppositely with parallel

study about the quark potential with anisotropy in this system. Afterwards, we
evaluate the pair production rate by solving the equation of motion for a
fundamental string numerically which reveals the consistent behavior with the

into the bulk in order to investigate the electric instability. The vacuum
decay rate can be obtained by evaluating the imaginary part of the D7-brane

for search ranking often requires more nuances and training signals. In this
paper, we identify and study the two mismatches between pre-training and
ranking fine-tuning: the training schema gap regarding the differences in
training objectives and model architectures, and the task knowledge gap
considering the discrepancy between the knowledge needed in ranking and that
learned during pre-training. To mitigate these gaps, we propose Pre-trained,
Prompt-learned and Pre-finetuned Neural Ranker (P^3 Ranker). P^3 Ranker
leverages prompt-based learning to convert the ranking task into a pre-training
like schema and uses pre-finetuning to initialize the model on intermediate
supervised tasks. Experiments on MS MARCO and Robust04 show the superior
performances of P^3 Ranker in few-shot ranking. Analyses reveal that P^3 Ranker
is able to better accustom to the ranking task through prompt-based learning
and retrieve necessary ranking-oriented knowledge gleaned in pre-finetuning,
resulting in data-efficient PLM adaptation. Our code is available at

deterministic predictions which provide only point estimates of future states.
These future estimates can help an autonomous vehicle plan its trajectory and
avoid collision. However, under dynamic traffic scenarios, planning based on
deterministic predictions is not trustworthy. Rather, estimating the
uncertainty associated with the predicted states with a certain level of
confidence can lead to robust path planning. Hence, the authors propose to
quantify this uncertainty during forecasting using stochastic approximation
which deterministic approaches fail to capture. The current method is simple
and applies Bayesian approximation during inference to standard neural network
architectures for estimating uncertainty. The authors compared the predictions
between the probabilistic neural network (NN) models with the standard
deterministic models. The results indicate that the mean predicted path of
probabilistic models was closer to the ground truth when compared with the
deterministic prediction. Further, the effect of stochastic dropout of weights
and long-term prediction on future state uncertainty has been studied. It was
found that the probabilistic models produced better performance metrics like
average displacement error (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE). Finally,
the study has been extended to multiple datasets providing a comprehensive
comparison for each model.

extremely-long length of the input. In this paper, we present an
extract-then-abstract Transformer framework to overcome the problem.
Specifically, we leverage pre-trained language models to construct a
hierarchical extractor for salient sentence selection across documents and an
abstractor for rewriting the selected contents as summaries. However, learning
such a framework is challenging since the optimal contents for the abstractor
are generally unknown. Previous works typically create pseudo extraction oracle
to enable the supervised learning for both the extractor and the abstractor.
Nevertheless, we argue that the performance of such methods could be restricted
due to the insufficient information for prediction and inconsistent objectives
between training and testing. To this end, we propose a loss weighting
mechanism that makes the model aware of the unequal importance for the
sentences not in the pseudo extraction oracle, and leverage the fine-tuned
abstractor to generate summary references as auxiliary signals for learning the
extractor. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning method that can
efficiently apply to the extractor for harmonizing the optimization between

outperforms strong baselines with comparable model sizes and achieves the best

early diagnosis or indicator of potential developmental disorder. Due to
limited public infant-related datasets, many works use the SMIL-based method to
generate synthetic infant images for training. However, this domain mismatch
between real and synthetic training samples often leads to performance
degradation during inference. In this paper, we present a CNN-based model which
takes any infant image as input and predicts the coarse and fine-level pose
labels. The model consists of an image branch and a pose branch, which
respectively generates the coarse-level logits facilitated by the unsupervised
domain adaptation and the 3D keypoints using the HRNet with SMPLify

hierarchical pose recognition module to estimate the fine-level pose labels. We
also collect and label a new AIMS dataset, which contains 750 real and 4000

interesting stories, professional writers often leverage a creative writing
technique called flashback that inserts past events into current storylines as
we commonly observe in novels and plays. However, it is challenging for
machines to generate flashback as it requires a solid understanding of event
temporal order (e.g. ""feeling hungry"" before ""eat,"" not vice versa), and the
creativity to arrange storylines so that earlier events do not always appear
first in narrative order. Two major issues in existing systems that exacerbate
the challenges: 1) temporal bias in pertaining and story datasets that leads to
monotonic event temporal orders; 2) lack of explicit guidance that helps
machines decide where to insert flashbacks. We propose to address these issues
using structured storylines to encode events and their pair-wise temporal
relations (before, after and vague) as temporal prompts that guide how stories
should unfold temporally. We leverage a Plan-and-Write framework enhanced by
reinforcement learning to generate storylines and stories end-to-end.
Evaluation results show that the proposed method can generate more interesting

behaviors when learning new tasks. This is in stark contrast to what is common
practice in physics-based character animation, where control policies are most
typically trained from scratch for each task. In this work, we present a
large-scale data-driven framework for learning versatile and reusable skill

techniques from adversarial imitation learning and unsupervised reinforcement
learning to develop skill embeddings that produce life-like behaviors, while
also providing an easy to control representation for use on new downstream

clips, without requiring any task-specific annotation or segmentation of the
motion data. By leveraging a massively parallel GPU-based simulator, we are
able to train skill embeddings using over a decade of simulated experiences,
enabling our model to learn a rich and versatile repertoire of skills. We show
that a single pre-trained model can be effectively applied to perform a diverse

attracted attention because of its robust ferroelectricity and Si process
compatibility in addition to being the first known ferroelectric wurtzite.
However, the origin and control of ferroelectricity in wurtzite materials is
not yet fully understood. Here we show that the local bond ionicity, rather
than simply the change in tetrahedral distortion, is key to controlling the
macroscopic ferroelectric response, according to our coupled experimental and
computational results. Across the composition gradient in Sc < 0.35 range and
140-260 nm thickness in combinatorial thin films of Al1-xScxN, the pure
wurtzite phase exhibits a similar c/a ratio regardless of the Sc content, due
to elastic interaction with neighboring crystals. The coercive field and
spontaneous polarization significantly decrease with increasing Sc content
despite this invariant c/a ratio, due to the more ionic bonding nature of Sc-N
relative to the more covalent Al-N bonds, supported by DFT calculations. Based
on these insights, ionicity engineering is introduced as an approach to reduce
coercive field of Al1-xScxN for memory and other applications and to control
ferroelectric properties in other wurtzites.

remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal
image-text representations. We apply a contrastive loss between unimodal image

outputs which predicts text tokens autoregressively. By sharing the same
computational graph, the two training objectives are computed efficiently with
minimal overhead. CoCa is pretrained end-to-end and from scratch on both

leptonic emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with the pulsar
J1907+0602. Moreover, we explain lower energy $\gamma$-ray emission by
considering the radiative cooling of the electrons that escaped from SNR
G40.5-0.5. Finally, the combined lepto-hadronic scenario was used to explain
the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) of LHAASO J1908+0621.
Although not yet significant, an ICECUBE hotspot of neutrino emission is
spatially associated with LHAASO J1908+0621, indicating a possible hadronic
contribution. In this paper, we show that if a hadronic component is present in
LHAASO J1908+0621, then the second generation ICECUBE observatory will detect

accurately detect a significant proportion of spam domains with a low false

classification scheme can detect spam domains before they send any mail, using
only a single DNS query and later on, it can refine its classification by
monitoring more traffic to the domain name.

magnetotail and helmet streamers in the solar corona. The pre-reconnection
current sheet evolution has been intensely studied in the magnetotail, where
in-situ spacecraft observations are available; but helmet streamer current
sheets studies are fewer, due to lack of in-situ observations -- they are
mostly investigated with numerical simulations and information that can be
surmised from remote sensing instrumentation. Both systems exhibit
qualitatively the same behavior, despite their largely different Mach numbers,
much higher at the solar corona than at the magnetotail. Comparison of
spacecraft data (from the magnetotail) with numerical simulations (for helmet
streamers) shows that the pre-reconnection current sheet thinning, for both
cases, is primarily controlled by plasma pressure gradients. Scaling laws of
the current density, magnetic field, and pressure gradients are the same for
both systems. We discuss how magnetotail observations and kinetic simulations
can be utilized to improve our understanding and modeling of the helmet

used a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of an orthogonal pulsar
magnetosphere restricted to the plane perpendicular to the star spin axis. We
evolved the solution for several tens of pulsar periods to gather a
statistically significant sample of synthetic pulse profiles. The formation of
plasmoids leads to strong pulse-to-pulse variability in the form of multiple
short, bright subpulses, which appear only on the leading edge of each main
pulse. These secondary peaks of emission are dominated by the dozen plasmoids
that can grow up to macroscopic scales. They emerge from the high end of the
hierarchical merging process occurring along the wind current layer. The flux
of the subpulses is correlated with their width in phase. Although the
full-scale separation is not realistic, we argue that the simulation correctly
captures the demographics and the properties of the largest plasmoids, and
therefore of the brightest subpulses. The prediction of subpulses at specific
pulse phases provides a new observational test of the magnetic reconnection
scenario as the origin of the pulsed incoherent emission. High-time-resolution

spin-polarized Fermi gas of $^{161}$Dy atoms, measuring three-body
recombination losses at low magnetic field. For field strength up to 1\,G, we
identify as much as 44 resonance features and observe plateaus of very low
losses. For four selected typical resonances, we study the dependence of the
three-body recombination rate coefficient on the magnetic resonance detuning
and on the temperature. We observe a strong suppression of losses with
decreasing temperature already for small detunings from resonance. The
characterization of complex behavior of three-body losses of fermionic
$^{161}$Dy is important for future applications of this peculiar species in

immersive experiences that seamlessly blend physical reality and digital

unprecedented storage, computation, and communication requirements. To this
end, the integrated evolution of next-generation networks (e.g., 5G and beyond)
and distributed cloud technologies (e.g., fog and mobile edge computing), have
emerged as a promising paradigm to address the interaction- and
resource-intensive nature of Metaverse applications. In this paper, we focus on
the design of control policies for the joint orchestration of compute, caching,
and communication (3C) resources in next-generation distributed cloud networks
for the efficient delivery of Metaverse applications that require the real-time
aggregation, processing, and distribution of multiple live media streams and
pre-stored digital assets. We describe Metaverse applications via directed
acyclic graphs able to model the combination of real-time stream-processing and
content distribution pipelines. We design the first throughput-optimal control
policy that coordinates joint decisions around (i) routing paths and processing
locations for live data streams, together with (ii) cache selection and
distribution paths for associated data objects. We then extend the proposed
solution to include a max-throughput database placement policy and two
efficient replacement policies. In addition, we characterize the network
stability regions for all studied scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate the
superior performance obtained via the novel multi-pipeline flow control and 3C
resource orchestration mechanisms of the proposed policy, compared with
state-of-the-art algorithms that lack full 3C integrated control.

the increasing distributed energy resources (DERs). However, how P2P to be
integrated into the existing power systems remains to be investigated. In this
paper, we apply network charge as a means for the grid operator to attribute
transmission loss and ensure network constraints for empowering P2P
transaction. The interaction between the grid operator and the prosumers is
modeled as a Stackelberg game, which yields a bi-level optimization problem. We
prove that the Stackelberg game admits an equilibrium network charge price.
Besides, we propose a method to obtain the network charge price by converting
the bi-level optimization into a single-level mixed-integer quadratic
programming (MIQP), which can handle a reasonable scale of prosumers
efficiently. Simulations on the IEEE bus systems show that the proposed optimal
network charge is favorable as it can benefit both the grid operator and the
prosumers for empowering the P2P market, and achieves near-optimal social
welfare. Moreover, the results show that the presence of energy storage will
make the prosumers more sensitive to the network charge price changes.

the proposed protocol is dynamic, uses a switching communication topology and
converges to median of measured signals. Stability and correctness of the

accuracy and influence of protocol parameters on the system output are
analyzed. The protocol is implemented and validated by a set of experiments on
an underwater group of robots comprising of aMussel units. This experimental

a neural network architecture consisting of a generator and a discriminator,

considering this kind of architecture, which leverages autoencoders (AEs)

networks. From a transceiver's standpoint, this can be materialized through the
implementation of fluid antennas (FAs). An FA consists of a dielectric holder,
in which a radiating liquid moves between pre-defined locations (called ports)
that serve as the transceiver's antennas. Due to the nature of liquids, FAs can
practically take any size and shape, making them both flexible and
reconfigurable. In this paper, we deal with the outage probability of FAs under
general fading channels, where a port is scheduled based on selection
combining. An analytical framework is provided for the performance with and
without estimation errors, as a result of post-scheduling delays. We show that
although FAs achieve maximum diversity, this cannot be realized in the presence
of delays. Hence, a linear prediction scheme is proposed that overcomes delays
and restores the lost diversity by predicting the next scheduled port.
Moreover, we design space-time coded modulations that exploit the FA's
sequential operation with space-time rotations and code diversity. The derived
expressions for the pairwise error probability and average word error rate give
an accurate estimate of the performance. We illustrate that the proposed design
attains maximum diversity, while keeping a low-complexity receiver, thereby
confirming the feasibility of FAs.

empirical evidence (i.e., detecting gravitons) for shedding light on the

it has been discovered that gravitationally-induced entanglement, tailored in
the interferometric frameworks, can be used to witness the quantum nature of
the gravity. Even though these schemes offer promising tools for investigating

quantum uncertainty and complementarity principles are the two other
foundational aspects of quantum physics, the quantum nature of the gravity
needs to manifest all of these features. Here, we lay out an interferometric

part of many emerging application domains, from IoT meshes to satellite

revocation of compromised or faulty devices. Unfortunately, current solutions
and techniques cannot cope with idiosyncrasies of constrained networks, since
they mandate frequent real-time communication with centralized entities,
storage and maintenance of large amounts of revocation information, and incur
considerable bandwidth overhead.
  To address the shortcomings of existing solutions, we design V'CER, a secure
and efficient scheme for certificate validation that augments and benefits a
PKI for constrained networks. V'CER utilizes unique features of Sparse Merkle
Trees (SMTs) to perform lightweight revocation checks, while enabling
collaborative operations among devices to keep them up-to-date when
connectivity to external authorities is limited. V'CER can complement any PKI
scheme to increase its flexibility and applicability, while ensuring fast
dissemination of validation information independent of the network routing or
topology. V'CER requires under 3KB storage per node covering 106 certificates.
We developed and deployed a prototype of V'CER on an in-orbit satellite and our
large-scale simulations demonstrate that V'CER decreases the number of requests
for updates from external authorities by over 93%, when nodes are

  Few-Shot Object Recognition",,,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Service robots are integrating more and more into our daily lives to help us
with various tasks. In such environments, robots frequently face new objects
while working in the environment and need to learn them in an open-ended
fashion. Furthermore, such robots must be able to recognize a wide range of
object categories. In this paper, we present a lifelong ensemble learning
approach based on multiple representations to address the few-shot object
recognition problem. In particular, we form ensemble methods based on deep
representations and handcrafted 3D shape descriptors. To facilitate lifelong
learning, each approach is equipped with a memory unit for storing and
retrieving object information instantly. The proposed model is suitable for
open-ended learning scenarios where the number of 3D object categories is not
fixed and can grow over time. We have performed extensive sets of experiments
to assess the performance of the proposed approach in offline, and open-ended
scenarios. For the evaluation purpose, in addition to real object datasets, we
generate a large synthetic household objects dataset consisting of 27000 views
of 90 objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on online few-shot 3D object recognition tasks, as well as its
superior performance over the state-of-the-art open-ended learning approaches.
Furthermore, our results show that while ensemble learning is modestly
beneficial in offline settings, it is significantly beneficial in lifelong
few-shot learning situations. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness
of our approach in both simulated and real-robot settings, where the robot
rapidly learned new categories from limited examples.

The ability of these models to account for the degree of synchrony in neural

present Letter we study the effects of finite size on the collective behaviour
of neural networks and show that they can be captured by appropriately modified

Local inhomogeneities in interstellar magnetic field strength and structure can
affect the local diffusivity and ensemble dynamics of the cosmic ray particles.
Magnetic traps (regions between magnetic mirrors located on the same magnetic
line) can lead to especially strong and persistent features in the CR spatial
distribution. Using test particle simulations, we study the spatial
distribution of an ensemble of CR particles (both protons and electrons) in
various magnetic field configurations, from an idealized axisymmetric trap to
those that emerge in intermittent (dynamo-generated) random magnetic fields. We
demonstrate that both the inhomogeneity in the CR sources and the energy losses

cultural economy, contributes to the increasing demand for the Korean language.
However, as there does not exist any application for foreigners to learn
Korean, this paper suggested a design of a novel Korean learning application.
Speech recognition, speech-to-text, and speech-to-waveform are the three key
systems in the proposed system. The Google API and the librosa library will
transform the user's voice into a sentence and MFCC. The software will then
display the user's phrase and answer, with mispronounced elements highlighted
in red, allowing users to more easily recognize the incorrect parts of their
pronunciation. Furthermore, the Siamese network might utilize those translated
spectrograms to provide a similarity score, which could subsequently be used to
offer feedback to the user. Despite the fact that we were unable to collect
sufficient foreigner data for this research, it is notable that we presented a
novel Korean pronunciation correction method for foreigners.

equations we theoretically investigate the electric conductivity of a conical
channel, which in accordance with recent experiments exhibits a strong
non-linear pressure dependence. This mechanosensitive diodic behavior stems
from the pressure-sensitive build-up or depletion of salt in the pore. From our
analytic results we find that the optimal geometry for this diodic behavior
strongly depends on the flow rate, the ideal ratio of tip-to-base-radii being
equal to 0.22 at zero flow. With increased flow this optimal ratio becomes
smaller and simultaneously the diodic performance becomes weaker. Consequently
an optimal diode is obtained at zero-flow, which is realized by applying a
pressure drop that is proportional to the applied potential and to the inverse
square of the tip radius thereby countering electro-osmotic flow. When the
applied pressure deviates from this ideal pressure drop the diodic performance
falls sharply, explaining the dramatic mechanosensitivity observed in
experiments.

reinforcement learning is proposed, which can reason about more comprehensive
relationships among all agents (robot and humans). Specifically, the next
position point is planned for the robot by introducing history information and
interactions in our work. Firstly, based on subgraph network, the history
information of all agents is aggregated before encoding interactions through a
graph neural network, so as to improve the ability of the robot to anticipate
the future scenarios implicitly. Further consideration, in order to reduce the
probability of unreliable next position points, the selection module is
designed after policy network in the reinforcement learning framework. In
addition, the next position point generated from the selection module satisfied
the task requirements better than that obtained directly from the policy
network. The experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both success rate and collision rate,
especially in crowded human environments.

regimes are identified characterized by the Capillary number (Ca) and velocity
ratios of the dispersed and continuous phases (q) within a standard T-junction.
Subsequently, under such conditions, a range of gutter configurations is
introduced in the standard channel. The results predict that the introduction
of JGs can favourably alter the formation frequency and morphology of drops
and, consequently, promote upscaling significantly for the hydrodynamic
conditions associated with low Ca. Detailed flow maps are presented that reveal
a plethora of transitions during the formation of droplets with higher Ca and q

Furthermore, we give a unique canonical form for stabilizer ZX-diagrams
inspired by recent work of Hu & Khesin [arXiv:2109.10210]. We prove that any
MBQC-like stabilizer ZX-diagram with Pauli flow can be rewritten into this

that each of these rules can be reversed while also preserving the existence of

density matrix elements in the Bose-Hubbard model. For an arbitrary initial
state, these quantities can be obtained from an SDE or stochastic differential
equation system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied.
This has the effect that all the information from the initial state moves into
the drift part, into the mean field part, of the transformed system. In the
large N limit with g=UN fixed, the diffusive part of the transformed system
vanishes and as a result, the exact quantum dynamics is given by an ODE system
which turns out to be the time dependent discrete Gross Pitaevskii equation.
For the two site Bose-Hubbard model, the GP equation reduces to the
mathematical pendulum and the particle imbalance is equal to the velocity of
that pendulum which is either oscillatory or it can have rollovers which then
corresponds to the self trapping or insulating phase. As a by-product, we also
find an equivalence of the mathematical pendulum with a quartic double well
potential. Collapse and revivals are a more subtle phenomenom, in order to see
these the diffusive part of the SDE system or quantum corrections have to be
taken into account. This can be done with an approximation and collapse and
revivals can be reproduced, numerically and also through an analytic
calculation. Since expectation values of Fresnel or Wiener diffusion processes,
we write the density matrix elements exactly in this way, can be obtained from
parabolic second order PDEs, we also obtain various exact PDE representations.
The paper has been written with the goal to come up with an efficient
calculation scheme for quantum many body systems and as such the formalism is
generic and applies to arbitrary dimension, arbitrary hopping matrices and,
with suitable adjustments, to fermionic models.

K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$, and the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $D^{+}\to
K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$, based on 980 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ of data recorded by
the Belle experiment at the KEKB $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. We measure these modes
relative to the Cabibbo-favored modes $D^{+}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$ and
$D_s^{+}\to K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$. Our results for the ratios of branching
fractions are $B(D^{+}\to K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})/B(D^{+}\to
K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}) = (11.32 \pm 0.13 \pm 0.26)\%$, $B(D^{+}\to
K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})/B(D^{+}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}) = (1.68 \pm
0.11\pm 0.03)\%$, and $B(D_s^{+}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})/B(D_s^{+}\to
K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}) = (17.13 \pm 0.62 \pm 0.51)\%$, where the
uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. The second value
corresponds to $(5.83\pm 0.42)\times\tan^4\theta_C$, where $\theta_C$ is the
Cabibbo angle; this value is larger than other measured ratios of branching
fractions for a doubly Cabibbo-suppressed charm decay to a Cabibbo-favored
decay. Multiplying these results by world average values for $B(D^{+}\to
K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})$ and $B(D_s^{+}\to K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})$
yields $B(D^{+}\to K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})= (7.08\pm 0.08\pm 0.16\pm
0.20)\times10^{-3}$, $B(D^{+}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0})= (1.05\pm 0.07\pm
0.02\pm 0.03)\times10^{-3}$, and $B(D_s^{+}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}) =
(9.44\pm 0.34\pm 0.28\pm 0.32)\times10^{-3}$, where the third uncertainty is
due to the branching fraction of the normalization mode. The first two results
are consistent with, but more precise than, the current world averages. The
last result is the first measurement of this branching fraction.

episode of dynamical instability among the giant planets. However, the
instability trigger and timing have not been clearly established.
Hydrodynamical modeling has shown that while the Sun's gaseous protoplanetary
disk was present the giant planets migrated into a compact orbital
configuration in a chain of resonances. Here we use dynamical simulations to
show that the giant planets' instability was likely triggered by the dispersal
of the gaseous disk. As the disk evaporated from the inside-out, its inner edge
swept successively across and dynamically perturbed each planet's orbit in
turn. The associated orbital shift caused a dynamical compression of the
exterior part of the system, ultimately triggering instability. The final
orbits of our simulated systems match those of the Solar System for a viable
range of astrophysical parameters. The giant planet instability therefore took
place as the gaseous disk dissipated, constrained by astronomical observations
to be a few to ten million years after the birth of the Solar System.
Terrestrial planet formation would not complete until after such an early giant
planet instability; the growing terrestrial planets may even have been sculpted
by its perturbations, explaining the small mass of Mars relative to Earth.

long-established paradigm for self-supervised video representation learning,
which achieves much inferior performance compared to instance discrimination
approaches (InstDisc) in recent works. However, based on a thorough comparison
of representative RecogTrans and InstDisc methods, we observe the great
potential of RecogTrans on both semantic-related and temporal-related
downstream tasks. Based on hard-label classification, existing RecogTrans
approaches suffer from noisy supervision signals in pre-training. To mitigate
this problem, we developed TransRank, a unified framework for recognizing
Transformations in a Ranking formulation. TransRank provides accurate
supervision signals by recognizing transformations relatively, consistently
outperforming the classification-based formulation. Meanwhile, the unified
framework can be instantiated with an arbitrary set of temporal or spatial
transformations, demonstrating good generality. With a ranking-based
formulation and several empirical practices, we achieve competitive performance
on video retrieval and action recognition. Under the same setting, TransRank
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by 6.4% on UCF101 and 8.3% on
HMDB51 for action recognition (Top1 Acc); improves video retrieval on UCF101 by
20.4% (R@1). The promising results validate that RecogTrans is still a worth

learning, which aims to represent the semantics of source code into distributed
vectors. Currently, various works have been proposed to represent the complex
semantics of source code from different views, including plain text, Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST), and several kinds of code graphs (e.g., Control/Data Flow
Graph). However, most of them only consider a single view of source code
independently, ignoring the correspondences among different views. In this
paper, we propose to integrate different views with the natural-language
description of source code into a unified framework with Multi-View contrastive
Pre-training, and name our model as CODE-MVP. Specifically, we first extract
multiple code views using compiler tools, and learn the complementary
information among them under a contrastive learning framework. Inspired by the
type checking in compilation, we also design a fine-grained type inference
objective in the pre-training. Experiments on three downstream tasks over five
datasets demonstrate the superiority of CODE-MVP when compared with several
state-of-the-art baselines. For example, we achieve 2.4/2.3/1.1 gain in terms
of MRR/MAP/Accuracy metrics on natural language code retrieval, code

problem that has received very little attention in the literature. The proposed
method can handle the signal-dependent noise in the inputs, process sequences
of any length, and be robust to inaccuracies in the exposure times.
Furthermore, it can be trained end-to-end with self-supervision, without
requiring ground truth high resolution frames, which makes it especially suited
to handle real data. Central to our method are three key contributions: i) a
base-detail decomposition for handling errors in the exposure times, ii) a
noise-level-aware feature encoding for improved fusion of frames with varying
signal-to-noise ratio and iii) a permutation invariant fusion strategy by
temporal pooling operators. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic and

single-exposure approaches that we adapted to the multi-exposure case.

observed that citations are made not only based on the pure scholarly

affiliation or gender of authors. In this way, citation bias is produced.
Existing works, however, have not analyzed preprints with respect to citation
bias, although they play an increasingly important role in modern scholarly
communication. In this paper, we investigate whether preprints are affected by
citation bias with respect to the author affiliation. We measure citation bias
for bioRxiv preprints and their publisher versions at the institution level and
country level, using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. This allows us to
mitigate the effects of confounding factors and see whether or not citation
biases related to author affiliation have an increased effect on preprint
citations. We observe consistent higher Gini coefficients for preprints than
those for publisher versions. Thus, we can confirm that citation bias exists
and that it is more severe in case of preprints. As preprints are on the rise,
affiliation-based citation bias is, thus, an important topic not only for
authors (e.g., when deciding what to cite), but also to people and institutions
that use citations for scientific impact quantification (e.g., funding agencies

rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for 6G. As Part III of the tutorial, this
letter provides an overview of integrating RSMA and reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS). We first introduce two potential PHY layer techniques, namely,
RSMA and RIS, including the need for integrating RSMA with RIS and how they
could help each other. Next, we provide a general model of an RIS-aided RSMA
system and summarize some key performance metrics. Then, we discuss the major
advantages of RIS-aided RSMA networks, and illustrate the rate region of
RIS-aided RSMA for both perfect and imperfect channel conditions. Finally, we
summarize the research challenges and open problems for RIS-aided RSMA systems.
In conclusion, RSMA is a promising technology for next generation multiple
access (NGMA) and future networks such as 6G and beyond.

conservation laws than what is necessary for complete integrability. This
severely constrains their dynamical processes, and it often leads to their

consider special Hamiltonian deformations of superintegrable quantum circuits.
The deformations break superintegrability, but they preserve integrability. We
focus on a selection of concrete models and show that for each model there is
an (at least) one parameter family of integrable deformations. Our most
interesting example is the so-called Rule54 model. We show that the model is
compatible with a one parameter family of Yang-Baxter integrable spin chains
with six-site interaction. Therefore, the Rule54 model does not have a unique
integrability structure, instead it lies at the intersection of a family of
quantum integrable models.

information retrieval that aims to extract a set of phrases with important
information from a source document. Identifying important keyphrase is the
central component of the keyphrase extraction task, and its main challenge is
how to represent information comprehensively and discriminate importance
accurately. In this paper, to address these issues, we design a new hyperbolic
matching model (HyperMatch) to represent phrases and documents in the same
hyperbolic space and explicitly estimate the phrase-document relevance via the
Poincar\'e distance as the important score of each phrase. Specifically, to
capture the hierarchical syntactic and semantic structure information,
HyperMatch takes advantage of the hidden representations in multiple layers of
RoBERTa and integrates them as the word embeddings via an adaptive mixing
layer. Meanwhile, considering the hierarchical structure hidden in the
document, HyperMatch embeds both phrases and documents in the same hyperbolic
space via a hyperbolic phrase encoder and a hyperbolic document encoder. This
strategy can further enhance the estimation of phrase-document relevance due to
the good properties of hyperbolic space. In this setting, the keyphrase
extraction can be taken as a matching problem and effectively implemented by
minimizing a hyperbolic margin-based triplet loss. Extensive experiments are
conducted on six benchmarks and demonstrate that HyperMatch outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines.

learning and three channel feature learning. This work explores the usefulness
of single channel feature learning from random MS and SAR bands compared to the
common notion of using three or more bands. In our linear evaluation, these
single channel features reached a 0.92 F1 score on the EuroSAT classification

also compared our results with ImageNet weights and showed that the RS based

assigning a single example to a new cluster, and $\mathbf{R_2}$ a pair of

operators that make significantly better perturbations. Nevertheless, both

  Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.14917",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we for the first time investigate the random access problem
for a delay-constrained heterogeneous wireless network. We begin with a simple
two-device problem where two devices deliver delay-constrained traffic to an
access point (AP) via a common unreliable collision channel. By assuming that
one device (called Device 1) adopts ALOHA, we aim to optimize the random access
scheme of the other device (called Device 2). The most intriguing part of this
problem is that Device 2 does not know the information of Device 1 but needs to
maximize the system timely throughput. We first propose a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) formulation to derive a model-based upper bound so as to quantify
the performance gap of certain random access schemes. We then utilize
reinforcement learning (RL) to design an R-learning-based random access scheme,
called tiny state-space R-learning random access (TSRA), which is subsequently
extended for the tackling of the general multi-device problem. We carry out
extensive simulations to show that the proposed TSRA simultaneously achieves
higher timely throughput, lower computation complexity, and lower power
consumption than the existing baseline--deep-reinforcement learning multiple
access (DLMA). This indicates that our proposed TSRA scheme is a promising
means for efficient random access over massive mobile devices with limited
computation and battery capabilities.

use computational complexity analysis to assess viable algorithmic options for

that automated team verification and design are by large both exact and

systematically search for all possible mechanical couplings in 2D lattice

the point-group symmetry of 2D lattices by applying the symmetry operation to

self-supervised learning task for multivariate time series anomaly detection.
With the increasing availability of sensor data from industrial systems, being
able to detecting anomalies from streams of multivariate time series data is of
significant importance. Given the scarcity of anomalies in real-world
applications, the majority of literature has been focusing on modeling
normality. The learned normal representations can empower anomaly detection as
the model has learned to capture certain key underlying data regularities. A
typical formulation is to learn a predictive model, i.e., use a window of time
series data to predict future data values. In this paper, we propose an
alternative self-supervised learning task. By randomly masking a portion of the
inputs and training a model to estimate them using the remaining ones, MAD is
an improvement over the traditional left-to-right next step prediction (NSP)
task. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAD can achieve better anomaly
detection rates over traditional NSP approaches when using exactly the same
neural network (NN) base models, and can be modified to run as fast as NSP
models during test time on the same hardware, thus making it an ideal upgrade

on sparse, learnable proposal boxes and proposal features. In this work, we
propose to improve Sparse R-CNN with two dynamic designs. First, Sparse R-CNN
adopts a one-to-one label assignment scheme, where the Hungarian algorithm is
applied to match only one positive sample for each ground truth. Such
one-to-one assignment may not be optimal for the matching between the learned
proposal boxes and ground truths. To address this problem, we propose dynamic
label assignment (DLA) based on the optimal transport algorithm to assign
increasing positive samples in the iterative training stages of Sparse R-CNN.
We constrain the matching to be gradually looser in the sequential stages as
the later stage produces the refined proposals with improved precision. Second,
the learned proposal boxes and features remain fixed for different images in
the inference process of Sparse R-CNN. Motivated by dynamic convolution, we
propose dynamic proposal generation (DPG) to assemble multiple proposal experts
dynamically for providing better initial proposal boxes and features for the
consecutive training stages. DPG thereby can derive sample-dependent proposal
boxes and features for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method,
named Dynamic Sparse R-CNN, can boost the strong Sparse R-CNN baseline with
different backbones for object detection. Particularly, Dynamic Sparse R-CNN
reaches the state-of-the-art 47.2% AP on the COCO 2017 validation set,

optimization and training of deep neural networks (DNNs), a process referred to
as neuroevolution, has gained momentum in recent years. The configuration and
training of these networks can be posed as optimization problems. Indeed, most
of the recent works on neuroevolution have focused their attention on
single-objective optimization. Moreover, from the little research that has been
done at the intersection of neuroevolution and evolutionary multi-objective
optimization (EMO), all the research that has been carried out has focused
predominantly on the use of one type of DNN: convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), using well-established standard benchmark problems such as MNIST. In
this work, we make a leap in the understanding of these two areas
(neuroevolution and EMO), regarded in this work as neuroevolutionary
multi-objective, by using and studying a rich DNN composed of a CNN and
Long-short Term Memory network. Moreover, we use a robust and challenging
vehicle trajectory prediction problem. By using the well-known Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, we study the effects of five different
objectives, tested in categories of three, allowing us to show how these
objectives have either a positive or detrimental effect in neuroevolution for
trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicles.

  Protocols","18 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prototyping and implementing distributed algorithms, particularly those that
address challenges related with fault-tolerance and dependability, is a time
consuming task. This is, in part, due to the need of addressing low level
aspects such as management of communication channels, controlling timeouts or
periodic tasks, and dealing with concurrency issues. This has a significant
impact for researchers that want to build prototypes for conducting
experimental evaluation; practitioners that want to compare different design
alternatives/solutions; and even for practical teaching activities on
distributed algorithms courses.
  In this paper we present Babel, a novel framework to develop, implement, and
execute distributed protocols and systems. Babel promotes an event driven
programming and execution model that simplifies the task of translating typical
specifications or descriptions of algorithms into performant prototypes, while
allowing the programmer to focus on the relevant challenges of these algorithms
by transparently handling time consuming low level aspects. Furthermore, Babel
provides, and allows the definition of, networking components that can capture
different network capabilities (e.g., P2P, Client/Server, phi-accrual Failure
Detector), making the code mostly independent from the underlying communication
aspects. Babel was built to be generic and can be used to implement a wide
variety of different classes of distributed protocols.
  We conduct our experimental work with two relevant case studies, a
Peer-to-Peer application and a State Machine Replication application, that show
the generality and ease of use of Babel and present competitive performance
when compared with significantly more complex implementations.

discuss conjectured connections with homotopy theory, including a proposal of a
category which unifies differentiable stacks, Lie algebroids and homotopy
theory. In Part 2 of this thesis we generalize the van Est map from a
comparison map between Lie groupoid cohomology and Lie algebroid cohomology to
a (more conceptual) comparison map between the cohomology of a stack
$\mathcal{G}$ and the cohomology of a simple foliation
$\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{G}$. In Part 1 we generalize the functions that we can
take cohomology of in the context of the van Est map. Instead of using
functions valued in representations, we can use functions valued in modules,
eg. we can use $S^1$-valued functions and $\mathbb{Z}$-valued functions.
Finally, everything we do works in both the smooth and holomorphic categories.
These generalizations allow us to derive results, including classical ones,
that could not be obtained with the usual van Est map, and they give a new
method of computing cohomology. Part 3 of this thesis involves a proposal of a
definition of Morita equivalences in the categories of Lie algebroids and
LA-groupoids. What we find is that our proposed category of LA-groupoids
unifies differentiable stacks, Lie algebroids and homotopy theory. In
particular, there are morphisms between Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids and we
show that such objects can be Morita equivalent. This gives another
interpretation of the van Est map. Using this category, we argue that a
classifying space for $G$ is just a space which is homotopy equivalent it. We
discuss higher generalized morphisms (given by gerbes) and we conjecture the
existence of a smooth version of Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis.

breaking down, in the sense that the channel estimates are not good enough to
spatially separate multiple user terminals, at low uplink reference signal
signal-to-noise ratios, due to insufficient channel estimation quality.
Instead, codebook-based downlink precoding has been advocated for as an
alternative solution in order to bypass this problem. We analyze this problem
by considering a ""grid-of-beams world"" with a finite number of possible
downlink channel realizations. Assuming that the terminal accurately can detect
the downlink channel, we show that in the case where reciprocity holds,
carefully designing a mapping between the downlink channel and the uplink

elegant metrics for designing this mapping, and further, we propose algorithms

plug between two partially-wetted parallel plates. The results closely follow
those obtained in a recent molecular-dynamics (MD) study of the same problem
Toledano (2021) which we use as a benchmark. We are able to interpret the
maximum speed of dewetting $U^*_{\mathrm{crit}}$ as a fold bifurcation in the
steady phase diagram and show that its dependence on the true contact angle
$\theta_{\mathrm{cl}}$ is quantitatively similar to that found using MD. A key
feature of the model is that the contact angle is dependent on the speed of the
contact line, with $\theta_{\mathrm{cl}}$ emerging as part of the solution. The
model enables us to study the formation of a thin film at dewetting speeds
$U^*>U^*_{\mathrm{crit}}$ across a range of length scales, including those that
are computationally prohibitive to MD simulations. We show that the thickness
of the film scales linearly with the channel width and is only weakly dependent
on the capillary number. This work provides a link between matched asymptotic
techniques (valid for larger geometries) and MD simulations (valid for smaller
geometries). In addition, we find that the apparent angle, the experimentally
visible contact angle at the fold bifurcation, is not zero. This is in contrast
to the prediction of conventional treatments based on the lubrication model of
flow near the contact line, but consistent with experiment.

that witness the planetary formation. Among these discs, transition discs (TDs)
are characterised by a wide cavity in the dust and gas distribution. Despite
this lack of material, many TDs strongly accrete onto their central star,
possibly indicating that a mechanism is driving fast accretion in TDs cavities.
The presence of radially extended 'dead zones' in PPDs recently revived the
interest in magnetised disc winds (MDWs), where accretion is driven by a large
magnetic field. We propose that TDs could be subject to similar winds,
explaining their fast-accreting and long-lived cavities. We present the results
of the first 2.5D global numerical simulations of TDs harbouring MDWs using the
PLUTO code. We impose a cavity in the gas distribution and consider a power law
distribution for the large-scale magnetic field strength. We assume weakly
ionised discs subject to ambipolar diffusion, as expected in this range of
densities and temperatures. Our simulated TDs reach a steady state with an
inner cavity and an outer 'standard' disc. The accretion rates remain
approximately constant through the entire discs, reaching
$10^{-7}~M_\odot/\text{yrs}^{-1}$ for typical surface density values. The MDW
launched from the cavity is more magnetised with a much larger lever arm than
the MDW launched from the outer disc. The material in the cavity is accreted at
sonic velocities, and the cavity itself is rotating at 70% of the Keplerian
velocity due to the efficient magnetic braking imposed by the MDW. Overall, our
cavity matches the dynamical properties of an inner jet emitting disc (JED) and
of magnetically arrested discs (MADs) in black hole physics. Finally, kinematic
diagnostics (wind speeds, orbital and accretion velocities) could disentangle
classical photo-evaporation from MDW models.

amplitudes and classical solutions in biadjoint scalar, gauge and gravity
theories. To date, no strongly coupled examples of the double copy in four
dimensions have been found, and previous attempts based on exact non-linear
solutions of biadjoint theory in Lorentzian signature have failed. In this
paper, we instead look for biadjoint solutions in Euclidean signature, which
may be relatable to Yang-Mills or gravitational instantons. We show that
spherically symmetric power-like Euclidean solutions do not exist in precisely
four spacetime dimensions. The explanation for why this is the case turns out
to involve the Eguchi-Hanson instanton, whose single copy structure is found to
be more complicated (and interesting) than previously thought. We provide a
more general prescription for double-copying instantons, and explain how our
results provide a higher-dimensional complement to a recently presented
non-perturbative double copy of exact solutions in two spacetime dimensions. In
doing so, we demonstrate how the replacement of colour by kinematic Lie
algebras operates at the level of exact classical solutions.

flux rope configurations as well as more problematic profiles such as those
with a significant radial component to the flux rope axis orientation or
profiles obtained with large impact parameters. We find general agreement among
the in-situ flux rope fitting results for the classic profiles and much more
variation among results for the problematic profiles. We also examine the
force-free assumption for a subset of the flux rope models and quantify
properties of the Lorentz force within MHD ejecta intervals. We conclude that
the in-situ flux rope models are generally a decent approximation to the field

of low-rank matrix reconstruction to the sub-diffraction scheme of atomic force
microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR), for efficient hyperspectral
infrared nanoimaging. To demonstrate its application potential, we chose the
trypanosomatid unicellular parasites Leishmania species as a realistic target
of biological importance. The mid-infrared spectral fingerprint window covering
the spectral range from 1300 to 1900 cm$^{-1}$ was chosen and a step width of
220 nm was applied for nanoimaging of single parasites. Multivariate statistics
approaches such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used for extracting
the chemically distinct spatial locations. Subsequently, we randomly selected
only 5% from an originally gathered data cube of 134 (x) $\times$ 50 (y)
$\times$ 148 (spectral) AFM-IR measurements and reconstructed the full data set
by low-rank matrix recovery. The technique is evaluated by showing agreement in
the cluster regions between full and reconstructed data cubes. We conclude that
the corresponding measurement time of more than 14 hours can be reduced to less

conditional approach extends the scope of existing studies by characterizing
the changes of the full range of the joint wind speed and direction
distribution. Directional wind speed distributions are estimated using two
statistical methods: a Weibull distributional regression model and a quantile
regression model, both of which enforce the circular constraint to their
resulting estimates of directional distributions. Projected uncertainties
associated with different climate models and model internal variability are
investigated and compared with the climate change signal to quantify the
statistical significance of the future projections. In particular this work
extends the concept of internal variability to the standard deviation and high
quantiles to assess the relative magnitudes to their projected changes. The
evaluation results show that the studied climate model capture both historical
wind speed, wind direction, and their dependencies reasonably well over both
inland and offshore locations. In the future, most of the locations show no
significant changes in mean wind speeds in both winter and summer, although the
changes in standard deviation and 95th-quantile show some robust changes over
certain locations in winter. The proposed conditional approach enables the

platforms called Internet memes. Internet memes are one of the most popular
contents used on social media, and they can be in the form of images with a
witty, catchy, or satirical text description. In this paper, we are dealing
with propaganda that is often seen in Internet memes in recent times.
Propaganda is communication, which frequently includes psychological and
rhetorical techniques to manipulate or influence an audience to act or respond
as the propagandist wants. To detect propaganda in Internet memes, we propose a
multimodal deep learning fusion system that fuses the text and image feature
representations and outperforms individual models based solely on either text
or image modalities.

adapts Optimal Transport principles to effectively leverage color distributions

them as different commodities that interact with a shared capacity on edges.

distinguish images in different classes. We show how our method can outperform

navigability, and service composition. This is realized by facilitating the IoT
objects to socialize with one another, i.e., similar to the social interactions
amongst the human beings. A fundamental issue that mandates careful attention
is to thus establish, and over time, maintain trustworthy relationships amongst
these IoT objects. Therefore, a trust framework for SIoT must include
object-object interactions, the aspects of social relationships, credible
recommendations, etc., however, the existing literature has only focused on
some aspects of trust by primarily relying on the conventional approaches that
govern linear relationships between input and output. In this paper, an
artificial neural network-based trust framework, Trust-SIoT, has been envisaged
for identifying the complex non-linear relationships between input and output
in a bid to classify the trustworthy objects. Moreover, Trust-SIoT has been
designed for capturing a number of key trust metrics as input, i.e., direct
trust by integrating both current and past interactions, reliability, and
benevolence of an object, credible recommendations, and the degree of
relationship by employing a knowledge graph embedding. Finally, we have
performed extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Trust-SIoT
vis-a-vis state-of-the-art heuristics on two real-world datasets. The results
demonstrate that Trust-SIoT achieves a higher F1 and lower MAE and MSE scores.

regarding the significant influence of celestial parameters on the
indeterminacy of the perihelion shift of Mercury's orbit. This shift is thought
to be one of the fundamental tests of the validity of the general theory of
relativity. In the current astrophysical community, it is generally accepted
that the additional relativistic perihelion shift of Mercury is the difference
between its observed perihelion shift and the one predicted by Newtonian
mechanics, and that this difference equals $43""$ per century. However, as it
results from the subtraction of two inexact numbers of almost equal magnitude,
it is subject to cancellation errors. As such, the above accepted value is
highly uncertain and may not correspond to reality.

we are able to derive algebraic expressions for existence and stability of the

of its top claim, which typically concerns safety or security. A natural
question is then ""how much"" confidence does the case provide? We argue that
confidence cannot be reduced to a single attribute or measurement. Instead, we
suggest it should be based on attributes that draw on three different
perspectives: positive, negative, and residual doubts.
  Positive Perspectives consider the extent to which the evidence and overall
argument of the case combine to make a positive statement justifying belief in
its claims. We set a high bar for justification, requiring it to be
indefeasible. The primary positive measure for this is soundness, which
interprets the argument as a logical proof. Confidence in evidence can be
expressed probabilistically and we use confirmation measures to ensure that the
""weight"" of evidence crosses some threshold. In addition, probabilities can be
aggregated from evidence through the steps of the argument using probability
logics to yield what we call probabilistic valuations for the claims.
  Negative Perspectives record doubts and challenges to the case, typically
expressed as defeaters, and their exploration and resolution. Assurance
developers must guard against confirmation bias and should vigorously explore
potential defeaters as they develop the case, and should record them and their
resolution to avoid rework and to aid reviewers.
  Residual Doubts: the world is uncertain so not all potential defeaters can be
resolved. We explore risks and may deem them acceptable or unavoidable. It is
crucial however that these judgments are conscious ones and that they are
recorded in the assurance case.

our prototype toolset for Assurance 2.0, assists in their evaluation.

constitutive laws with physics-consistent deep neural networks. In contrast to
supervised learning, which assumes the availability of stress-strain pairs, the
approach only uses realistically measurable full-field displacement and global
reaction force data, thus it lies within the scope of our recent framework for
Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery (EUCLID)
and we denote it as NN-EUCLID. The absence of stress labels is compensated for
by leveraging a physics-motivated loss function based on the conservation of
linear momentum to guide the learning process. The constitutive model is based
on input-convex neural networks, which are capable of learning a function that
is convex with respect to its inputs. By employing a specially designed neural
network architecture, multiple physical and thermodynamic constraints for
hyperelastic constitutive laws, such as material frame indifference,
(poly-)convexity, and stress-free reference configuration are automatically
satisfied. We demonstrate the ability of the approach to accurately learn
several hidden isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive laws -
including e.g., Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce, Ogden, and Holzapfel models -
without using stress data. For anisotropic hyperelasticity, the unknown
anisotropic fiber directions are automatically discovered jointly with the
constitutive model. The neural network-based constitutive models show good
generalization capability beyond the strain states observed during training and
are readily deployable in a general finite element framework for simulating
complex mechanical boundary value problems with good accuracy.

(ECG). In 1912, he proposed a method of determining the electric axis of the
heart by using an imaginary equilateral triangle connecting the limb leads, now
known as Einthoven's triangle. In 1924, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the mechanisms of the
electrocardiogram. More than a century later, Einthoven's triangle is still at
the heart of ECG interpretation. It defines the axes of the ECG leads in the
frontal plane, that in turn, determines the axis of the cardiac electric
dipole. The method is ubiquitously taught in lectures and applied in clinical
settings. But Einthoven did not provide a proof for choosing the equilateral
triangle. Future medical literature have not explored its origins. This paper
provides a formal proof of its derivation to complete this important chapter in
medical history and medical education. In addition, the proof determines the
geometric conditions for alternative systems of bipolar ECG lead configurations
in the frontal plane.

it is responsible for determining the starting time of each activity according

off-nadir images for the aforementioned tasks requires the computation of
geocentric pose, which is an aerial vehicle's spatial orientation with respect
to gravity. This study proposes a deep learning ensemble framework to predict
geocentric pose using 5,923 near-nadir and off-nadir RGB satellite images of
cities worldwide. First, a U-Net Fully Convolutional Neural Network predicts
the pixel-wise above-ground elevation mask of the RGB images. Then, the
elevation masks are concatenated with the RGB images to form four-channel
inputs fed into a second convolutional model, which predicts orientation angle
and magnification scale. A performance accuracy of R2=0.917 significantly
outperforms previous methodologies. In addition, outlier removal is performed
through supervised interpolation, and a sensitivity analysis of elevation masks
is conducted to gauge the usefulness of data features, motivating future
avenues of feature engineering. The high-accuracy software built in this study
contributes to mapping and navigation procedures for effective disaster

However, since these records are usually messy, this graph is very sparse,

additional nodes that improve the quality of job title representation.
Specifically, we construct \textit{Job-Transition-Tag Graph}, a heterogeneous

reformulate job title representation learning as the task of learning node
