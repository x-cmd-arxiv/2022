sensing based land use / land cover classification. However, the relationship
between mapping accuracy of built-up surfaces and morphological characteristics
of built-up areas has not been analyzed explicitly, and previous studies
typically rely on aggregated landscape metrics to quantify the morphology of
built-up areas, neglecting the fine-grained spatial variation and scale
dependency of such metrics. Herein, we aim to fill this gap by assessing the
associations between focal landscape metrics, derived from binary built-up
surfaces, and focal data accuracy estimates. We test our approach for built-up
surfaces from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) for Massachusetts (USA),
by examining the explanatory power of landscape metrics for predictive modeling
of commission and omission errors in the GHS-BUILT R2018A data product. We find
that the Landscape Shape Index (LSI) exhibits the highest levels of correlation
to focal accuracy measures. These relationships are scale-dependent, and
increase with the level of spatial support. Our results are consistent across
different regions within the U.S., and we find that the Recall measure has the
strongest relationship to measures of built-up surface morphology across
different temporal epochs and spatial resolutions. Regression analysis results
(R2>0.9) indicate that it is possible to estimate commission errors in the GHSL
in the absence of reference data, and that omission errors in the GHSL can be
modeled without accessing the data themselves. Lastly, we test the
generalizability of our predictive accuracy models to a different version of
the GHSL (i.e., the GHS-BUILT-S2) covering a study area in North Carolina. We
find varying levels of model transferability that increases with the spatial
support at which landscape metrics and accuracy estimates are calculated.

several disciplines. Its advantages include uncovering hidden interactions in
data and automating procedures which were performed manually in the past.
Representation learning is also being adopted by earth and environmental
sciences. However, there are still subfields that depend on manual feature
engineering based on expert knowledge and the use of algorithms which do not
utilize the latent space. Relying on those techniques can inhibit operational
decision-making since they impose data constraints and inhibit automation. In
this work, we adopt a case study for nitrogen response rate prediction and
examine if representation learning can be used for operational use. We compare
a Multilayer Perceptron, an Autoencoder, and a dual-head Autoencoder with a
reference Random Forest model for nitrogen response rate prediction. To bring
the predictions closer to an operational setting we assume absence of future
weather data, and we are evaluating the models using error metrics and a
domain-derived error threshold. The results show that learning latent
representations can provide operational nitrogen response rate predictions by
offering performance equal and sometimes better than the reference model.

all known wireless communication security threats (e.g., eavesdropping and

innovative Physical Layer Security (PLS) solutions to protect such
communication. Among the different solutions, the novel Reflective Intelligent
Surface (RIS) technology coupled with VLCs has been successfully demonstrated
in recent work to improve the VLC communication capacity. However, to date, the
literature still lacks analysis and solutions to show the PLS capability of
RIS-based VLC communication. In this paper, we combine watermarking and jamming
primitives through the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec)
algorithm to secure VLC communication at the physical layer. Our solution
leverages RIS technology to improve the security properties of the
communication. By using an optimization framework, we can calculate RIS phases
to maximize the WBPLSec jamming interference schema over a predefined area in
the room. In particular, compared to a scenario without RIS, our solution
improves the performance in terms of secrecy capacity without any assumption
about the adversary's location. We validate through numerical evaluations the
positive impact of RIS-aided solution to increase the secrecy capacity of the
legitimate jamming receiver in a VLC indoor scenario. Our results show that the
introduction of RIS technology extends the area where secure communication
occurs and that by increasing the number of RIS elements the outage probability
decreases.

that bio-inspired models tend to be adversarially robust without requiring any

adversarially trained models in the presence of more real-world common

  A configuration of $n$ monomers in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be written as a
collection of $d$ coordinate vectors, each in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our first main
result is that entries from different coordinate vectors are uncorrelated, even
when they are different coordinates of the same monomer. We predict that this
property holds in realistic simulations and in actual polymer configurations
(in the absence of an external field).
  Our second main contribution is a theorem explaining when and how a
probability distribution on embeddings of a complicated graph may be pushed
forward to a distribution on embeddings of a simpler graph to aid in
computations. This construction is based on the idea of chain maps in homology
theory. We use it to give a new formula for edge covariances in phantom network
theory and to compute some expectations for a freely-jointed network.

derive the most general forms (class A) of both the Hamiltonian and boundary
condition in 1D (insulator), 2D (quantum anomalous Hall insulator), and 3D
(Weyl node) and analytically calculate and explore the corresponding general
bound/edge/surface-state structures. In 1D, one bound state exists in the half
of the $\text{U}(1)$ parameter space of possible boundary conditions.
Considering several dimensions simultaneously ties the models together and
uncovers important relations between them. We formulate a version of
bulk-boundary correspondence that fully characterizes the vicinity of a Weyl
point: the chirality of the surface-state spectrum along a path enclosing the
projected Weyl point is equal to the Chern number of the Weyl point. We
demonstrate how symmetries are naturally incorporated into the formalism, by
deriving the most general form of the model with chiral symmetry (class AIII).
We show that the (perhaps unexpected) existence of persistent bound states in
the topologically trivial 1D class-A model is not accidental and has at least
two topological explanations, by relating it to the topologically nontrivial 2D
class-A (by viewing it as an effective 2D quantum anomalous Hall system) and 1D
class-AIII (via deviation from the cases of chiral symmetry in the parameter
space) models. We identify this as a systematic ""propagation effect"", whereby
bound states from topologically nontrivial classes, where they are protected
and guaranteed to exist, propagate to the related, ""adjacent"" in dimension or
symmetry, topologically trivial classes.

function approximation in science and engineering applications. This success is
largely attributed to the GP's analytical tractability, robustness,
non-parametric structure, and natural inclusion of uncertainty quantification.
Unfortunately, the use of exact GPs is prohibitively expensive for large
datasets due to their unfavorable numerical complexity of $O(N^3)$ in
computation and $O(N^2)$ in storage. All existing methods addressing this issue
utilize some form of approximation -- usually considering subsets of the full
dataset or finding representative pseudo-points that render the covariance
matrix well-structured and sparse. These approximate methods can lead to
inaccuracies in function approximations and often limit the user's flexibility
in designing expressive kernels. Instead of inducing sparsity via data-point
geometry and structure, we propose to take advantage of naturally-occurring
sparsity by allowing the kernel to discover -- instead of induce -- sparse
structure. The premise of this paper is that GPs, in their most native form,
are often naturally sparse, but commonly-used kernels do not allow us to
exploit this sparsity. The core concept of exact, and at the same time sparse
GPs relies on kernel definitions that provide enough flexibility to learn and
encode not only non-zero but also zero covariances. This principle of
ultra-flexible, compactly-supported, and non-stationary kernels, combined with
HPC and constrained optimization, lets us scale exact GPs well beyond 5 million
data points.

to establish context and explore in depth. However, conversational question
answering (ConvQA) systems have long been stymied by scarce training data that
is expensive to collect. To address this problem, we propose a new technique
for synthetically generating diverse and high-quality dialog data: dialog
inpainting. Our approach takes the text of any document and transforms it into
a two-person dialog between the writer and an imagined reader: we treat
sentences from the article as utterances spoken by the writer, and then use a
dialog inpainter to predict what the imagined reader asked or said in between
each of the writer's utterances. By applying this approach to passages from
Wikipedia and the web, we produce WikiDialog and WebDialog, two datasets
totalling 19 million diverse information-seeking dialogs -- 1,000x larger than
the largest existing ConvQA dataset. Furthermore, human raters judge the answer
adequacy and conversationality of WikiDialog to be as good or better than
existing manually-collected datasets. Using our inpainted data to pre-train
ConvQA retrieval systems, we significantly advance state-of-the-art across
three benchmarks (QReCC, OR-QuAC, TREC CAsT) yielding up to 40% relative gains

its amino acid sequence have long been one of the key mysteries of biophysics.
Often simplistic models, such as those derived from geometric constraints,
capture bulk real-world 3D protein-protein properties well. One approach is
using protein contact maps to better understand proteins' properties. Here, we
investigate the emergent behaviour of contact maps for different geometrically
constrained models and real-world protein systems. We derive an analytical
approximation for the distribution of model amino acid distances, $s$, by means
of a mean-field approach. This approximation is then validated for simulations
using a 2D and 3D random interaction model, as well as from contact maps of
real-world protein data. Using data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) and
AlphaFold~2 database, the analytical approximation is fitted to protein chain
lengths of $L\approx100$, $L\approx200$, and $L\approx300$. While a universal
scaling behaviour for protein chains of different lengths could not be deduced,
we present evidence that the amino acid distance distributions can be
attributed to geometric constraints of protein chains in bulk and amino acid
sequences only play a secondary role.

difference between the performance of an oracle with perfect information of
future types (values) and an online policy. While the case of distributions
over a few discrete types is well understood, very little is known when there
are many types, with the exception of the special case of a uniform
distribution of types. In this work we consider a larger class of distributions
which includes the few discrete types as a special case. We first establish the
insufficiency of the common certainty equivalent heuristic for distributions
with many types and ""gaps"" (intervals) of absent types; even for simple
deviations from the uniform distribution, it leads to regret
$\Theta(\sqrt{T})$, as large as that of a non-adaptive algorithm. We introduce
a new algorithmic principle which we call ""conservativeness with respect to
gaps"" (CwG), and use it to design an algorithm that applies to any
distribution. We establish that the proposed algorithm yields optimal regret
scaling of $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{1/2 - 1/(2(\beta + 1))})$ for a broad class of
distributions with gaps, where $\beta$ quantifies the mass accumulation of
types around gaps. We recover constant regret scaling for the special case of a
bounded number of types ($\beta=0$ in this case). In most practical network
revenue management problems, the number of types is large and the current
certainty equivalent heuristics scale poorly with the number of types. The new
algorithmic principle called \emph{Conservatism w.r.t Gaps} (CwG) that we
developed, can pave the way for progress on handling many types for the broader

different layers of the multiplex network. Existing studies attempt to predict

analyze the effects of intralayer links. Namely, few works study the backbone
structures which can effectively preserve the predictive accuracy while dealing
with a smaller number of intralayer links. It can be used to investigate what
types of intralayer links are most important for correct prediction. Are there
any intralayer links whose presence leads to worse predictive performance than
their absence, and how to attack the prediction algorithms at the minimum cost?
To this end, two kinds of network structural perturbation methods are proposed.
For the scenario where the structural information of the whole network is
completely known, we offer a global perturbation strategy that gives different
perturbation weights to different types of intralayer links and then selects a
predetermined proportion of intralayer links to remove according to the
weights. In contrast, if these information cannot be obtained at one time, we
design a biased random walk procedure, local perturbation strategy, to execute
perturbation. Four kinds of interlayer link prediction algorithms are carried
out on different real-world and artificial perturbed multiplex networks. We
find out that the intralayer links connected with small degree nodes have the
most significant impact on the prediction accuracy. The intralayer links
connected with large degree nodes may have side effects on the interlayer link
prediction.

world is a difficult, but crucial, public health endeavor. Attributing deaths,
direct or indirect, to COVID-19 is problematic. A more attainable target is the
""excess deaths"", the number of deaths in a particular period, relative to that
expected during ""normal times"", and we estimate this for all countries on a
monthly time scale for 2020 and 2021. The excess mortality requires two
numbers, the total deaths and the expected deaths, but the former is
unavailable for many countries, and so modeling is required for these
countries. The expected deaths are based on historic data and we develop a
model for producing expected estimates for all countries and we allow for
uncertainty in the modeled expected numbers when calculating the excess. We
describe the methods that were developed to produce the World Health
Organization (WHO) excess death estimates. To achieve both interpretability and
transparency we developed a relatively simple overdispersed Poisson count
framework, within which the various data types can be modeled. We use data from
countries with national monthly data to build a predictive log-linear
regression model with time-varying coefficients for countries without data. For
a number of countries, subnational data only are available, and we construct a
multinomial model for such data, based on the assumption that the fractions of
deaths in sub-regions remain approximately constant over time. Based on our
modeling, the point estimate for global excess mortality, over 2020-2021, is
14.9 million, with a 95% credible interval of (13.3, 16.6) million. This leads
to a point estimate of the ratio of excess deaths to reported COVID-19 deaths
of 2.75, which is a huge discrepancy.

successes of this task. However, their used constraints for pluralistic image

aspects. First, the constraints for visual reality can be weakly correlated to
the objective of image completion or even redundant. Second, the constraints
for diversity are designed to be task-agnostic, which causes the constraints to
not work well. In this paper, to address the issues, we propose an end-to-end
probabilistic method. Specifically, we introduce a unified probabilistic graph
model that represents the complex interactions in image completion. The entire
procedure of image completion is then mathematically divided into several
sub-procedures, which helps efficient enforcement of constraints. The
sub-procedure directly related to pluralistic results is identified, where the
interaction is established by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The inherent
parameters of GMM are task-related, which are optimized adaptively during
training, while the number of its primitives can control the diversity of
results conveniently. We formally establish the effectiveness of our method and

the spatial density of the targets, and subsequently with the combination of
catalogues. However, this requires their careful inter-calibration. Our aim is
to develop methods of inter-calibration of two different catalogues. We used as
reference a spectrophotometric catalogue. A principal component analysis was
performed in G,GB,GR,J,H,K multi-colour space for the second catalog. The
subspace constituted by the two first components was split into cells in which
we estimated deviations from the reference. The deviations were computed using
all targets from the reference located at a short spatial distance of each
secondary target. Corrections and filtering were deduced for each cell in the
multi-colour space. We applied the technique to two different datasets: on the
one hand, the spectrophotometric catalogue, and, on the other hand, a catalogue
of extinctions based on photometry of Gaia eDR3 and 2MASS. After calibration,
the dispersion of the extinction among neighbouring points in the second
catalogue is reduced, regardless of whether reference targets are present
locally. Weak structures are then more apparent. The extinction of high
Galactic latitude targets is more tightly correlated with the dust emission, a
property acquired from the first catalogue. A hierarchical inversion technique
was applied to the two merged inter-calibrated catalogues to produce 3D
extinction density maps corresponding to different volumes and maximum spatial
resolution. The maximum resolution is 10pc for a 3000x3000x800pc3 volume around
the Sun, and the maximum size of the maps is 10x10x0.8 kpc3 for a resolution of

  benefits from treatment (PIBT)","16 pages, 4 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The premise of this work, in a vein similar to predictive inference with
quantile regression, is that observations may lie far away from their
conditional expectation. In the context of causal inference, due to the
missing-ness of one outcome, it is difficult to check whether an individual's
treatment effect lies close to its prediction given by the estimated Average
Treatment Effect (ATE) or Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). With the
aim of augmenting the inference with these estimands in practice, we further
study an existing distribution-free framework for the plug-in estimation of
bounds on the probability an individual benefits from treatment (PIBT), a
generally inestimable quantity that would concisely summarize an intervention's
efficacy if it could be known. Given the innate uncertainty in the target
population-level bounds on PIBT, we seek to better understand the margin of
error for the estimation of these target parameters in order to help discern
whether estimated bounds on treatment efficacy are tight (or wide) due to
random chance or not. In particular, we present non-asymptotic guarantees to
the estimation of bounds on marginal PIBT for a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) setting. We also derive new non-asymptotic results for the case where we
would like to understand heterogeneity in PIBT across strata of pre-treatment
covariates, with one of our main results in this setting making strategic use
of regression residuals. These results, especially those in the RCT case, can
be used to help with formal statistical power analyses and frequentist
confidence statements for settings where we are interested in inferring PIBT
through the target bounds under minimal parametric assumptions.

develop a framework for constructing uncertainty sets that provably control
risk -- such as coverage of confidence intervals, false negative rate, or F1
score -- in the online setting. This extends conformal prediction to apply to a
larger class of online learning problems. Our method guarantees risk control at
any user-specified level even when the underlying data distribution shifts
drastically, even adversarially, over time in an unknown fashion. The technique
we propose is highly flexible as it can be applied with any base online
learning algorithm (e.g., a deep neural network trained online), requiring
minimal implementation effort and essentially zero additional computational
cost. We further extend our approach to control multiple risks simultaneously,
so the prediction sets we generate are valid for all given risks. To
demonstrate the utility of our method, we conduct experiments on real-world
tabular time-series data sets showing that the proposed method rigorously
controls various natural risks. Furthermore, we show how to construct valid
intervals for an online image-depth estimation problem that previous sequential
calibration schemes cannot handle.

exploits the BAO feature imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function
to measure cosmological distances independent of any specific cosmological
model. We forecast the expected precision of future and ongoing spectroscopic
galaxy surveys to measure distances leveraging the linear point. We investigate
the cosmological implications of our forecasted results. We focus in particular
on a relevant working example: the detection of the late-time cosmic
acceleration independent of other cosmological probes. Our findings show that,
even within the LCDM standard cosmological paradigm, estimated distances need
to be reliable over a very wide parameter range in order to realize their
maximum utility. This is particularly relevant if we aim to properly
characterize cosmological tensions. The LP is a promising candidate approach to
achieve this reliability. In contrast, widely employed procedures in BAO
analysis estimate distances keeping fixed cosmological parameters to fiducial
values close to cosmic-microwave-background constraints in flat-LCDM. It is
unclear whether they are purely geometric methods. Moreover, they rely on
untested extrapolations to explore the parameter space away from those fiducial
flat-LCDM values. We recommend that all BAO methodologies be validated across
the full range of models and parameters over which their results are quoted,

technologies, from optical communication of spin information to novel display
and imaging technologies. As such, there has been significant effort in the
development of chiral emissive materials that allow for the emission of
strongly dissymmetric CP light from organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). A
consensus for chiral emission in such devices is that the molecular chirality
of the active layer determines the favored light handedness of CP emission,
regardless of the light-emitting direction. Here, we discover that,
unconventionally, oppositely propagating CP light exhibits opposite handedness,
and reversing the current-flow in OLEDs also switches the handedness of the
emitted CP light. This direction-dependent CP emission boosts the net
polarization rate by orders of magnitude by resolving an established issue in
CP-OLEDs, where the CP light reflected by the back electrode typically erodes
the measured dissymmetry. Through detailed theoretical analysis, we assign this
anomalous CP emission to a ubiquitous topological electronic property in chiral
materials, namely the orbital-momentum locking. Our work paves the way to
design new chiroptoelectronic devices and probes the close connections between
chiral materials, topological electrons, and CP light in the quantum regime.

minimize total perimeter among all $q-1$ bubbles enclosing prescribed volume,
for any $q \leq n+2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^3$ was
confirmed in 2000 by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritor\'e-Ros, and is nowadays fully
resolved for all $n \geq 2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and
triple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^2$ have also been resolved, but all
other cases are in general open. We confirm the conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^n$
and on $\mathbb{S}^n$ for all $q \leq \min(5,n+1)$, namely: the double-bubble
conjectures for $n \geq 2$, the triple-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 3$ and
the quadruple-bubble conjectures for $n \geq 4$. In fact, we show that for all
$q \leq n+1$, a minimizing cluster necessarily has spherical interfaces, and
after stereographic projection to $\mathbb{S}^n$, its cells are obtained as the
Voronoi cells of $q$ affine-functions, or equivalently, as the intersection
with $\mathbb{S}^n$ of convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Moreover, the
cells (including the unbounded one) are necessarily connected and intersect a
common hyperplane of symmetry, resolving a conjecture of Heppes. We also show

pairs of cells is necessarily a standard bubble. The proof makes crucial use of

ionising radiation and extreme stellar winds. It is these winds that determine
their lifepaths until expiration. Observations in the Arches cluster show that
VMS all have similar temperatures. The VLT-Flames Tarantula survey analysed VMS
in the 30 Dor region of the LMC also finding a narrow range of temperatures,
albeit at higher values - likely a metallicity effect. Using MESA, we study the
main-sequence evolution of VMS with a new mass-loss recipe that switches from
optically-thin O-star winds to optically-thick Wolf-Rayet type winds through
the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of Vink & Gr\""afener. We
examine the temperature evolution of VMS with mass loss that scales with the
luminosity-over-mass (L/M) ratio and the Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_{\rm
e}$), assessing the relevance of the surface hydrogen (H) abundance which sets
the number of free electrons. We present grids of VMS models at Galactic and
LMC metallicity and compare our temperature predictions with empirical results.
Models with a steep $\Gamma_{\rm e}$-dependence evolve horizontally in the
Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram at nearly constant luminosities, requiring a
delicate and unlikely balance between envelope inflation and enhanced mass loss
over the entire VMS mass range. By contrast, models with a steep L/M-dependent
mass loss are shown to evolve vertically in the HR-diagram at nearly constant
Teff, naturally reproducing the narrow range of observed temperatures, as well
as the correct trend with metallicity. This distinct behavior of a steeply
dropping luminosity is a self-regulatory mechanism that keeps temperatures
constant during evolution in the HR-diagram.

provides a unique way of characterizing small-scale dark matter halos, and
could allow us to uncover the fundamental properties of dark matter's
constituents. Recently, gravitational imaging techniques made it possible to
detect a few heavy subhalos. However, gravitational lenses contain numerous
subhalos and line-of-sight halos, whose subtle imprint is extremely difficult
to detect individually. Existing methods for marginalizing over this large
population of sub-threshold perturbers to infer population-level parameters are
typically computationally expensive, or require compressing observations into
hand-crafted summary statistics, such as a power spectrum of residuals. Here,
we present the first analysis pipeline to combine parametric lensing models and
a recently-developed neural simulation-based inference technique called
truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) to constrain the warm dark
matter halo mass function cutoff scale directly from multiple lensing images.
Through a proof-of-concept application to simulated data, we show that our
approach enables empirically testable inference of the dark matter cutoff mass
through marginalization over a large population of realistic perturbers that
would be undetectable on their own, and over lens and source parameters
uncertainties. To obtain our results, we combine the signal contained in a set
of images with Hubble Space Telescope resolution. Our results suggest that
TMNRE can be a powerful approach to put tight constraints on the mass of warm
dark matter in the multi-keV regime, which will be relevant both for existing
lensing data and in the large sample of lenses that will be delivered by
near-future telescopes.

Our dataset includes spectra taken during the brightest phases of the outburst

associated with accretion disc winds, such as blue-shifted absorptions, broad
emission line wings and flat-top profiles. We find broad emission line wings in
H-alpha during the hard-to-soft transition and blue-shifted absorption troughs

to infrared) accretion disc wind present in the system. We discuss the
properties of the wind and compare them with those seen in other X-ray
transients. In particular, the wind velocity that we observe is low when
compared to those of other systems, which might be a direct consequence of the
relatively low binary inclination, as suggested by several observables. This

mass X-ray binaries and that they can also be detected in low inclination
objects via high-quality optical and infrared spectroscopy.

star-forming regions, it is still unclear how dynamically significant the
magnetic fields are at varying physical scales, because direct measurement of
the field strength is observationally difficult. The Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
(DCF) method has been the most commonly used method to estimate the magnetic
field strength from polarization data. It is based on the assumption that gas
turbulent motion is the driving source of field distortion via linear Alfv\'en
waves. In this work, using MHD simulations of star-forming clouds, we test the
validity of the assumption underlying the DCF method by examining its accuracy
in the real 3D space. Our results suggest that the DCF relation between
turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic energy fluctuation should be treated as a
statistical result instead of a local property. We then develop and investigate
several modifications to the original DCF method using synthetic observations,
and propose new recipes to improve the accuracy of DCF-derived magnetic field
strength. We further note that the biggest uncertainty in the DCF analysis may
come from the linewidth measurement instead of the polarization observation,
especially since the line-of-sight gas velocity can be used to estimate the gas
volume density, another critical parameter in the DCF method.

In the case of galaxy clusters with a virial temperature of $3\times10^7$ K,
this level corresponds to a suppression factor of $\approx10^{-3}$ of the
classical Braginskii value. The intrinsic, numerical viscosity of our SPH

bands. In this work we analyse observations of methanol (CH3OH), one of the
simplest complex organic molecules crucial for organic chemistry in
star-forming regions, and of two chemically related species, HCO and
formaldehyde (H2CO), towards 15 out of the 35 targets of the CHEMOUT sample. In
fact, only targets previously detected in both HCO and H2CO, both precursors of
methanol, were considered. We detected CH3OH in all 15 targets. Using a Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium approach, we derive CH3OH excitation temperatures in
the range 7 - 16 K and line widths smaller than 4 km/s, consistent with
emission from a cold and quiescent envelope. The CH3OH fractional abundances
w.r.t. H2 range between ~0.6 x 10^{-9} and ~7.4 x 10^{-9}. These values are
comparable to those found in star-forming regions in the inner and local
Galaxy. Our results have important implications in the organic, and possibly
pre-biotic, chemistry occurring in the outermost star-forming regions of the
Galaxy, and can help setting the frontiers of the Galactic habitable zone.

the properties of these silicate dust vary with stellocentric distance remains
an open question. We re-analyze the beta Pictoris debris disk spectrum from the
Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and a new IRTF/SpeX spectrum to investigate
trends in Fe/Mg ratio, shape, and crystallinity in grains as a function of
wavelength, a proxy for stellocentric distance. By analyzing a re-calibrated

feature and recover a 23 micron forsterite emission feature with a
substantially larger line-to-continuum ratio than previously reported. We find
that these prominent spectral features are primarily produced by small
submicron-sized grains, which are continuously generated and replenished from
planetesimal collisions in the disk and can elucidate their parent bodies'
composition. We discover three trends about these small grains: as
stellocentric distance increases, (1) small silicate grains become more
crystalline (less amorphous), (2) they become more irregular in shape, and (3)
for crystalline silicate grains, the Fe/Mg ratio decreases. Applying these
trends to beta Pic's planetary architecture, we find that the dust population
exterior to the orbits of beta Pic b and c differs substantially in
crystallinity and shape. We also find a tentative 3-5 micron dust excess due to
spatially unresolved hot dust emission close to the star. From our findings, we
infer that the surfaces of large planetesimals are more Fe-rich and
collisionally-processed closer to the star but more Fe-poor and primordial
farther from the star.

J181414.6-225604, a Galactic hard X-ray transient discovered during the ongoing
SRG/ART-XC sky survey. Using data from the Palomar Gattini-IR survey, we
identify a spatially and temporally coincident variable infrared (IR) source,
IRAS 18111-2257, and classify it as a very late-type (M7-M8), long period
($1502 \pm 24$ days) and luminous ($M_K\approx -9.9 \pm 0.2$) O-rich Mira donor
star located at a distance of $\approx 14.6^{+2.9}_{-2.3}$ kpc. Combining
multi-color photometric data over the last $\approx 25$ years, we show that the
IR counterpart underwent a recent (starting $\approx 800$ days before the X-ray
flare) enhanced mass loss (reaching $\approx 2.1 \times 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$) episode resulting in an expanding dust shell obscuring the
underlying star. Multi-epoch follow-up from Swift, NICER and NuSTAR reveal a
$\approx 200$ day long X-ray outburst reaching a peak luminosity of $L_X
\approx 2.5 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, characterized by a heavily absorbed
($N_{\rm H} \approx 6\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) X-ray spectrum consistent with
an optically thick Comptonized plasma. The X-ray spectral and timing behavior
suggest the presence of clumpy wind accretion together with a dense ionized
nebula overabundant in silicate material surrounding the compact object.
Together, we show that SRGA J181414.6-225604 is a new symbiotic X-ray binary in

interest due to its flexibility in modeling a variety of systems like
interacting particles, materials and industrial projects for, e.g., the design

knowledge graph embedding algorithms, where entities and relations of a
knowledge graph are mapped to a low-dimensional vector space while preserving
its semantic structure. Recently, a graph embedding method has been proposed
that maps graph elements to the temporal domain of spiking neural networks.
However, it relies on encoding graph elements through populations of neurons
that only spike once. Here, we present a model that allows us to learn spike
train-based embeddings of knowledge graphs, requiring only one neuron per graph
element by fully utilizing the temporal domain of spike patterns. This coding
scheme can be implemented with arbitrary spiking neuron models as long as
gradients with respect to spike times can be calculated, which we demonstrate
for the integrate-and-fire neuron model. In general, the presented results show
how relational knowledge can be integrated into spike-based systems, opening up
the possibility of merging event-based computing and relational data to build
powerful and energy efficient artificial intelligence applications and

in non-convex optimization, and it ensures that many first-order optimization
algorithms will almost always escape saddle points. However, functions exist in
machine learning that do not satisfy this property, such as the loss function
of a neural network with at least two hidden layers. First-order methods such
as gradient descent may converge to non-strict saddle points of such functions,
and there do not currently exist any first-order methods that reliably escape
non-strict saddle points. To address this need, we demonstrate that
regularizing a function with a linear term enforces the strict saddle property,
and we provide justification for only regularizing locally, i.e., when the norm
of the gradient falls below a certain threshold. We analyze bifurcations that
may result from this form of regularization, and then we provide a selection
rule for regularizers that depends only on the gradient of an objective
function. This rule is shown to guarantee that gradient descent will escape the

previously-published spectra, of a divide in the 3-$\mu$m spectral properties

band centers $<$ 3 $\mu$m) has a spectral shape consistent with carbonaceous
chondrite meteorites, while the other group (""not-Sharp-types"" or NST, with
bands centered $>$ 3 $\mu$m) is not represented in the meteorite literature but
is as abundant as the STs among large objects. Both groups are present in most
low-albedo asteroid taxonomic classes, and except in limited cases taxonomic
classifications based on 0.5-2.5-$\mu$m data alone cannot predict whether an
asteroid is ST or NST.
  Statistical tests show the STs and NSTs differ in average band depth,
semi-major axis, and perihelion at confidence levels $\ge$98\%, while not
showing significant differences in albedo. We also show that many NSTs have a
3-$\mu$m absorption band shape like Comet 67P, and likely represent an
important small-body composition throughout the solar system. A simple
explanation for the origin of these groups is formation on opposite sides of
the ammonia snow line, with the NST group accreting H2O and NH3 and the ST
group only accreting H2O, with subsequent thermal and chemical evolution
resulting in the minerals seen today. Such an explanation is consistent with
recent dynamical modeling of planetesimal formation and delivery, and suggests
that much more outer solar system material was delivered to the main asteroid
belt than would be thought based on the number of D-class asteroids found

Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are inherently immune against backdoor attacks
since the weights are designed to be marginal distributions to quantify the
uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on
effective learning and targeted utilization of reverse distribution. This paper
makes three important contributions. (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first backdoor attack that can effectively break the robustness of BNNs.
(2) We produce reverse distributions to cancel the original distributions when
the trigger is activated. (3) We propose an efficient solution for merging
probability distributions in BNNs. Experimental results on diverse benchmark

Specifically, a line of quantum repeater nodes is used to build a linear
cluster state among all nodes, which is then used to anonymously establish a
secret key between any three of them. The nodes need only share maximally
entangled pairs with their neighbours, therefore avoiding the necessity of a
central server sharing entangled states. This repeater setup makes our protocol
an excellent candidate for implementation in future quantum networks. We
explicitly prove that our protocol protects the identities of the participants

variable star V533 Her. We detect a periodicity consistent with the binary
orbital period and estimate a revised value of 3.53709(2) hr. We also detect a
strong signal near a period of 3.8 h that we associate with positive
superhumps. The superhump frequency varies over the TESS observations with the
fractional difference between the superhump and orbital periods, $\epsilon$,
ranging between $0.055\le \epsilon \le 0.080$. The superhump amplitude is
correlated with its frequency such that the amplitude increases as $\epsilon$
decreases. Positive superhumps result from an instability that generates an
eccentric accretion disk and $\epsilon$ is a measure of the disk precession
rate in the binary rest frame. The observed correlation implies that as the
disk precession rate slows, the disk eccentricity increases.

by difficulty, which is often cumbersome to perform. In this work, we propose a
novel curriculum learning approach termed Learning Rate Curriculum (LeRaC),
which leverages the use of a different learning rate for each layer of a neural
network to create a data-free curriculum during the initial training epochs.
More specifically, LeRaC assigns higher learning rates to neural layers closer
to the input, gradually decreasing the learning rates as the layers are placed
farther away from the input. The learning rates increase at various paces
during the first training iterations, until they all reach the same value. From
this point on, the neural model is trained as usual. This creates a model-level
curriculum learning strategy that does not require sorting the examples by
difficulty and is compatible with any neural network, generating higher
performance levels regardless of the architecture. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on eight datasets from the computer vision (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny ImageNet), language (BoolQ, QNLI, RTE) and audio (ESC-50, CREMA-D)
domains, considering various convolutional (ResNet-18, Wide-ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121), recurrent (LSTM) and transformer (CvT, BERT, SepTr)
architectures, comparing our approach with the conventional training regime.
Moreover, we also compare with Curriculum by Smoothing (CBS), a
state-of-the-art data-free curriculum learning approach. Unlike CBS, our
performance improvements over the standard training regime are consistent
across all datasets and models. Furthermore, we significantly surpass CBS in
terms of training time (there is no additional cost over the standard training
regime for LeRaC).

supermassive black-hole (SMBH) growth, the properties of the host galaxies, and
their cosmic evolution. We investigate the effects of different kinetic
feedback prescriptions on the observable properties of AGN and their host
galaxies at $z>6$ in a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations. We find that
kinetic feedback decreases the column density of the interstellar medium (ISM)
in the host galaxy by up to a factor of $\approx10$, especially when the SMBHs
reach high accretion rates ($\approx10-30\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$). In
particular, kinetic feedback is required to extend the ISM size to $>1$ kpc and
match the observed sizes of the gas reservoirs in $z>6$ AGN host galaxies.
Moreover, it produces unobscured lines of sight along which the AGN can be
detected in the rest-frame UV band with magnitudes consistent with observed
values of $z>6$ AGN. The assumed geometry of the outflow plays an important
role in shaping the observed properties of high-redshift AGN. We find that a
biconical geometry is favored over a spherical one to reproduce the observed
properties, but it overestimates the number of multiple AGN systems detectable
in X-ray observations. This result suggests that simplistic BH seeding recipes
widely employed in cosmological simulations produce too many X-ray detectable
multiple AGN at $z=6-7$, thus soliciting the adoption of more physically
motivated seeding prescriptions.

deep-learning-based algorithms to learn the statistical properties of an

will not be needed anymore to obtain future ensemble forecasts, and the
statistical properties of the ensemble can be derived from a single

three-dimensional model and also experiment with a shared latent space

compare the polar circumbinary disc accretion flow with the previously studied
coplanar case. In the coplanar case, the circumbinary disc becomes eccentric
and the accretion alternates from being dominant onto one binary member to the
other. For the polar disc case involving a highly eccentric binary, we find
that the circumbinary disc retains its initially low eccentricity and that the

looking at eventual properties of matrices and recurrences that underlie the
system. A basic problem that lies at the core of many questions in this setting
is the following: given a set of pairs of rational weights and matrices {(w_1 ,
A_1 ), . . . , (w_m , A_m )}, we ask if the weighted sum of powers of these
matrices is eventually non-negative P (resp. n positive), i.e., does there
exist an integer N s.t for all n greater than N , (w_1 A_1^n + ... + w_m A_m^n)
is atmost 0 (resp. greater than 0). The restricted setting when m = w_1 = 1,
results in so-called eventually non-negative (or eventually positive) matrices,
which enjoy nice spectral properties and have been well-studied in control
theory. More applications arise in varied contexts, ranging from program
verification to partially observable and multi-modal systems.
  Our goal is to investigate this problem and its link to linear recurrence
sequences. Our first result is that for m at least 2, the problem is as hard as
the ultimate positivity of linear recurrences, a long standing open question
(known to be coNP-hard). Our second result is a reduction in the other
direction showing that for any m at least 1, the problem reduces to ultimate
positivity of linear recurrences. This shows precise upper bounds for several
subclasses of matrices by exploiting known results on linear recurrence
sequences. Our third main result is a novel reduction technique for a large
class of problems (including those mentioned above) over rational
diagonalizable matrices to the corresponding problem over simple real-algebraic
matrices. This yields effective decision procedures for diagonalizable

the classic linear discriminant analysis for higher-order data classification
generally referred to as multilinear discriminant analysis (MDA). Most of the
existing approaches are based on the Tucker decomposition and $\textit{n}$-mode
tensor-matrix products. The current paper presents a new approach to
tensor-based multilinear discriminant analysis referred to as High-Order
Multilinear Discriminant Analysis (HOMLDA). This approach is based upon the
tensor decomposition where an order-$\textit{n}$ tensor can be written as a
product of order-$\textit{n}$ tensors and has a natural extension to
traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Furthermore, the resulting
framework, HOMLDA, might produce a within-class scatter tensor that is close to
singular. Thus, computing the inverse inaccurately may distort the discriminant
analysis. To address this problem, an improved method referred to as Robust
High-Order Multilinear Discriminant Analysis (RHOMLDA) is introduced.
Experimental results on multiple data sets illustrate that our proposed

-1.8 \pm 0.1$) in peak $EM$ down to our completeness limit of 4200 pc
cm$^{-6}$. The electron densities of the filamentary structure range from $10 <
n_e~{\rm[cm^{-3}]} < 400$ with a median value of 35 cm$^{-3}$, remarkably
similar to [N II] surveys of ionized gas. Cyg OB2 may ionize at most two-thirds
of the total ionized gas and the ionized gas in filaments. More than half of
the filamentary structures are likely photoevaporating surfaces flowing into a
surrounding diffuse (~5 cm$^{-3}$) medium. However, this is likely not the case
for all ionized gas ridges. A characteristic width in the distribution of
ionized gas points to the stellar winds of Cyg OB2 creating a fraction of the
ionized filaments through swept-up ionized gas or dissipated turbulence.

predictive models are often used in decision making. In many cases, these are
mechanistic first principles models which aim to accurately describe the
process. In practice, the parameters of these models need to be tuned to the
process conditions at hand. If the conditions change, which is common in
practice, the model becomes inaccurate and needs to be re-tuned. In this paper,
we propose a hybrid modeling machine learning framework that allows tuning
first principles models to process conditions using two different types of
Bayesian Neural Networks. Our approach not only estimates the expected values
of the first principles model parameters but also quantifies the uncertainty of
these estimates. Such an approach of hybrid machine learning modeling is not
yet well described in the literature, so we believe this paper will provide an
additional angle at which hybrid machine learning modeling of physical systems
can be considered. As an example, we choose a multiphase pipe flow process for
which we constructed a three-phase steady state model based on the drift-flux
approach which can be used for modeling of pipe and well flow behavior in oil
and gas production systems with or without the neural network tuning. In the
simulation results, we show how uncertainty estimates of the resulting hybrid

Lojasiewicz inequality to prove convergence results in various spaces with

and concentration-dispersion dynamics. Lotka-Volterra equations describe the
population dynamics of a group of species. Under the assumption that the
interaction between species is symmetric, we present two different methods to
derive the convergence result. One, the entropy trapping method, is to adapt
the idea of Akin and Hofbauer (Math. Biosci. 61 (1982) 51-62) of using
monotonicity of the energy to bound the entropy, which provides the proximal
distance of the solution from the desired equilibrium. Another method, inspired
by Jabin and Liu's observation in (Nonlinearity 30 (2017) 4220) is to change
variables to resolve the singular nature of gradient structure. We apply this
idea to show the convergence result in generalized Lokta-Volterra systems, such
as regularized Lotka-Volterra systems and infinite dimensional Lotka-Volterra
equations with mutation. Concentration-dispersion dynamics is a new type of
equation that is inspired by fixed point formulations for solitary wave shapes.
As a continuous time analogue of Petviashvili iteration, we aim to dynamically
calculate the nontrivial solitary wave profile. Using the gradient structure we
deduce the existence of nontrivial solitary and periodic wave profiles.
Unfortunately, the convergence result remains open. Instead, we regularize the
concentration dispersion equations by adding a nonlinear diffusive term, and
prove the convergence of the solutions by using the Lojasiewicz convergence
framework.

promising solution to support 5G and B5G wireless networks in dynamic scenarios
and applications. However, mobility introduces many challenges as well as
opportunities to mmWave applications. To address these problems, we conduct a
survey of the opportunities and technologies to support mmWave communications
in mobile scenarios. Firstly, we summarize the mobile scenarios where mmWave
communications are exploited, including indoor wireless local area network
(WLAN) or wireless personal area network (WPAN), cellular access,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X), high speed train (HST), unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV), and the new space-air-ground-sea communication scenarios. Then, to
address users' mobility impact on the system performance in different
application scenarios, we introduce several representative mobility models in
mmWave systems, including human mobility, vehicular mobility, high speed train
mobility and ship mobility. Next we survey the key challenges and existing
solutions to mmWave applications, such as channel modeling, channel estimation,
anti-blockage, and capacity improvement. Lastly, we discuss the open issues
concerning mobility-aware mmWave communications that deserve further
investigation. In particular, we highlight future heterogeneous mobile
networks, dynamic resource management, artificial intelligence (AI) for
mobility and integration of geographical information, deployment of large
intelligent surface and reconfigurable antenna technology, and finally, the
evolution to Terahertz (THz) communications.

approach to compositional data analysis (CoDA). This application regards
relative count data, which are, e.g., obtained from sequencing experiments.
First we review in some detail a variety of necessary concepts ranging from
basic count distributions and their information-geometric description over the
link between Bayesian statistics and shrinkage to the use of power
transformations in CoDA. We then show that powering, i.e., the equivalent to
scalar multiplication on the simplex, can be understood as a shrinkage problem
on the tangent space of the simplex. In information-geometric terms,
traditional shrinkage corresponds to an optimization along a mixture (or m-)
geodesic, while powering (or, as we call it, exponential shrinkage) can be
optimized along an exponential (or e-) geodesic. While the m-geodesic
corresponds to the posterior mean of the multinomial counts using a conjugate
prior, the e-geodesic corresponds to an alternative parametrization of the
posterior where prior and data contributions are weighted by geometric rather
than arithmetic means. To optimize the exponential shrinkage parameter, we use
mean-squared error as a cost function on the tangent space. This is just the
expected squared Aitchison distance from the true parameter. We derive an
analytic solution for its minimum based on the delta method and test it via
simulations. We also discuss exponential shrinkage as an alternative to zero
imputation for dimension reduction and data normalization.

function with $G$ a group, it only makes sense to constrain the DNN to be
$G$-invariant as well. However, there can be many different ways to do this,
thus raising the problem of ``$G$-invariant neural architecture design'': What
is the optimal $G$-invariant architecture for a given problem? Before we can
consider the optimization problem itself, we must understand the search space,
the architectures in it, and how they relate to one another. In this paper, we
take a first step towards this goal; we prove a theorem that gives a
classification of all $G$-invariant single-hidden-layer or ``shallow'' neural
network ($G$-SNN) architectures with ReLU activation for any finite orthogonal
group $G$, and we prove a second theorem that characterizes the inclusion maps
or ``network morphisms'' between the architectures that can be leveraged during
neural architecture search (NAS). The proof is based on a correspondence of
every $G$-SNN to a signed permutation representation of $G$ acting on the
hidden neurons; the classification is equivalently given in terms of the first
cohomology classes of $G$, thus admitting a topological interpretation. The
$G$-SNN architectures corresponding to nontrivial cohomology classes have, to
our knowledge, never been explicitly identified in the literature previously.
Using a code implementation, we enumerate the $G$-SNN architectures for some
example groups $G$ and visualize their structure. Finally, we prove that
architectures corresponding to inequivalent cohomology classes coincide in
function space only when their weight matrices are zero, and we discuss the
implications of this for NAS.

known but understudied challenge in requirements engineering, especially in
organizations that adopt continuous software engineering (CSE) practices.
During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many CSE organizations complied with
working remotely due to the imposed health restrictions; some continued to work
remotely while implementing business processes to facilitate team communication
and productivity. In remote CSE organizations, managing NFRs becomes more
challenging due to the limitations to team communication coupled with the
incentive to deliver products quickly. While previous research has identified
the factors that lead to a lack of shared understanding of NFRs in CSE, we
still have a significant gap in understanding how CSE organizations,
particularly in remote work, build a shared understanding of NFRs in their
software development. We conduct a three-month ethnography-informed case study
of a remote CSE organization. Through thematic analysis of our qualitative data
from interviews and observations, we identify a number of practices in
developing a shared understanding of NFRs. The collaborative workspace the
organization uses for remote interaction is Gather, which simulates physical
workspaces, and which our findings suggest allows for informal communications
instrumental for building shared understanding. As actionable insights, we
discuss our findings in light of proactive practices that represent
opportunities for software organizations to invest in building a shared

variations in the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of FRB 20180916B. Over the nine
month period 2021 April$-$2021 December we observe an apparent secular increase
in $\rm{RM}$ of $\sim 50 \; \rm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ (a fractional change of over
$40\%$) that is accompanied by a possible drift of the emitting band to lower
frequencies. This interval displays very little variation in the dispersion
measure ($\Delta \rm{DM}\lesssim 0.8\; \rm{pc\, cm^{-3}}$) which indicates that
the observed RM evolution is likely produced from coherent changes in the
Faraday-active medium's magnetic field. Burst-to-burst RM variations appear
unrelated to the activity cycle phase. The degree of linear polarization of our
burst sample ($\gtrsim 80\%$) is consistent with the negligible depolarization
expected for this source in the 400-800 MHz bandpass of CHIME. FRB 20180916B
joins other repeating FRBs in displaying substantial RM variations between
bursts. This is consistent with the notion that repeater progenitors may be
associated with young stellar populations by their preferential occupation of
dynamic magnetized environments commonly found in supernova remnants, pulsar
wind nebulae or near high mass stellar companions.

magnetic fields is usually characterized in terms of the diffusion parallel and
perpendicular to a large-scale (or mean) magnetic field. The nonlinear guiding
center theory (NLGC) has been a prominent perpendicular diffusion theory. A
recent version of this theory, based on random ballistic spreading of magnetic
field lines and a backtracking correction (RBD/BC), has shown good agreement
with test particle simulations for a two-component magnetic turbulence model.
The aim of the present study is to test the generality of the improved theory
by applying it to the noisy reduced magnetohydrodynamic (NRMHD) turbulence
model, determining perpendicular diffusion coefficients that are compared with
those from the field line random walk (FLRW) and unified nonlinear (UNLT)
theories and our test particle simulations. The synthetic NRMHD turbulence
model creates special conditions for energetic particle transport, with no
magnetic fluctuations at higher parallel wavenumbers so there is no resonant
parallel scattering if the particle Larmor radius $R_{\rm L}$ is even slightly
smaller than the minimum resonant scale. This leads to non-monotonic variation
in the parallel mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$ with $R_{\rm L}$. Among the
theories considered, only RBD/BC matches simulations within a factor of two
over the range of parameters considered. This accuracy is obtained even though
the theory depends on $\lambda_\parallel$ and has no explicit dependence on
$R_{\rm L}$. In addition, the UNLT theory often provides accurate results and
even the FLRW limit provides a very simple and reasonable approximation in many
cases.

further extend the unified flat representation of multiple input documents by

Furthermore, ridge features are also vividly present in the chemical properties

asymmetrical. Moreover, we find that diagonal ridge structures may affect the

conventional data augmentation strategies such as synonym substitution, though

traditional accounting method of treating all GPUs as being equal is not
reflecting compute output anymore. Moreover, for applications that require
significant CPU-based compute to complement the GPU-based compute, it is
becoming harder and harder to make full use of the newer GPUs, requiring
sharing of those GPUs between multiple applications in order to maximize the

be expressed in GPU core hours, much like it is normally done for the CPUs.
While GPU core compute throughput does change between GPU generations, the
variability is similar to what we expect to see among CPU cores. To validate
our position, we present an extensive set of run time measurements of two
IceCube photon propagation workflows on 14 GPU models, using both on-prem and

high-resolution subsurface models. However, one of the main conventional
full-waveform optimization problems challenges is cycle-skipping, usually
leading us to an inaccurate local minimum model. A highly investigated track to
alleviate this challenge involves designing a more global measure of misfit
between the observed and modelled data beyond the sample-to-sample comparison.
However, most of these approaches admit relatively smooth inversion results.
Here, we introduce a novel misfit function based on the Fourier-based metric.
This metric has been successfully applied in molecular physics for solving the
Boltzmann equation, and we adapt it to full-waveform inversion. This misfit
function exploits the power spectrum information between the modelled and
observed data to provide low-wavenumber velocity model updates early, and more
high resolution updates as we approach the solution. Thus, it also can be
reformulated as a weighted $\ell_{2}$-norm in a quadratic case, which can be
seen as a simple extension for conventional full-waveform inversion. Thus,
despite its robustness to cycle skipping, it is capable of delivering
high-resolution models synonymous to conventional FWI. Considering its
frequency domain utilization, we refer to this inversion method as
$\omega$-FWI. Through the synthetic Marmousi model example, this method
successfully recovers an accurate velocity model, starting from a linearly
increasing model even for the case of noisy observed data and the lack of low
frequencies below 3 Hz and 5Hz, in which the conventional $\ell_{2}$-norm
full-waveform inversion suffers from cycle skipping.

data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale
of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data.
Although this problem has been recently recognized, practitioners have limited
resources to respond to it, and so must continue using models that they know
are likely misleading. Existing methods either (a) require that the difference
between causal and measurement timescales is known; or (b) can handle only very
small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; or
(c) apply to only pairs of variables, though with fewer assumptions about prior
knowledge; or (d) return impractically too many solutions. This paper addresses
all four challenges. We combine constraint programming with both theoretical
insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible
causal interactions. The resulting system provides a practical approach that
scales to significantly larger sets (>100) of random variables, does not
require precise knowledge of the timescale difference, supports edge
misidentification and parametric connection strengths, and can provide the
optimum choice among many possible solutions. The cumulative impact of these

of possible entity configurations at each moment in time, with possibly very
different congestion properties. We define different measures of what we call
the congestion potential of such spaces, in terms of the (dynamic) intersection
graph of the uncertainty regions associated with entities, to describe the
congestion that might actually occur.
  Previous work [SoCG'13, EuroCG'14, SICOMP'16, SODA'19], in the same

using location queries of some bounded frequency. It was shown that it is
possible to design a query scheme that is $O(1)$-competitive, in terms of
worst-case congestion potential, with other, even clairvoyant query schemes

query frequency.
  In this paper we address the dual problem: how to guarantee a fixed bound on
congestion potential while minimizing the query frequency, measured in terms of
total number of queries or the minimum spacing between queries (granularity),

functional data sequentially observed on a general d-dimensional space, where
we allow the functional curves to be either sparsely or densely sampled. Data
of this form naturally arise in a wide range of applications such as biology,
neuroscience, climatology, and finance. To achieve such a task, we propose a
kernel-based algorithm named functional seeded binary segmentation (FSBS). FSBS
is computationally efficient, can handle discretely observed functional data,
and is theoretically sound for heavy-tailed and temporally-dependent
observations. Moreover, FSBS works for a general d-dimensional domain, which is
the first in the literature of change-point estimation for functional data. We
show the consistency of FSBS for multiple change-point estimations and further
provide a sharp localisation error rate, which reveals an interesting phase
transition phenomenon depending on the number of functional curves observed and
the sampling frequency for each curve. Extensive numerical experiments
illustrate the effectiveness of FSBS and its advantage over existing methods in
the literature under various settings. A real data application is further
conducted, where FSBS localises change-points of sea surface temperature
patterns in the south Pacific attributed to El Nino.

different optical elements, which increases its cost and complexity.
Metasurfaces hold great promise to providing new functionality for miniaturized

the metasurface's ability to respond to the polarization of light, which adds a
new degree of freedom to the optical design. Here, we show that polarization
control enables a form-birefringent metalens to correct for both spherical and
off-axis aberrations using a single element only, which is not possible with
bulk optics. The metalens encodes two phase profiles onto the same surface,
thus allowing switching from high resolution to wide field of view operation.
Such ability to obtain both high resolution and wide field of view in a single

which may find many applications, e.g., in microscopy and endoscopy.

by identifying the factors underlying those defects. Traditionally, engineers
search and organize structural condition-related information based on visual
inspections. Even following the same qualitative inspection standards,
experienced engineers tend to find the critical defects and predict the
underlying reasons more reliably than less experienced ones. Unique bridge and
site conditions, quality of available data, and personal skills and knowledge
collectively influence such a subjective nature of data-driven bridge
diagnosis. Unfortunately, the lack of detailed data about how experienced
engineers observe bridge defects and identify failure modes makes it hard to
comprehend what engineers' behaviors form the best practice of producing
reliable bridge inspection. Besides, even experienced engineers could sometimes
fail to notice critical defects, thereby producing inconsistent, conflicting
condition assessments. Therefore, a detailed cognitive behavior analysis of
bridge inspectors is critical for enabling a proactive inspector coaching
system that uses inspectors' behavior histories to complement personal
limitations. This paper presents a computational framework for revealing
engineers' observation and cognitive-behavioral processes to identify bridge
defects and produce diagnosis conclusions. The authors designed a bridge
inspection game consisting of FEM simulation data and inspection reports to
capture and analyze experienced and inexperienced engineers' diagnosis
behaviors. Mining these behavioral logs have revealed reusable behavioral
process patterns that map critical bridge defects and diagnosis conclusions.
The results indicate that the proposed method can proactively share inspection
experiences and improve inspection processes' explainability and reliability.

different current injection geometries, which lead to the transformation from
I-shaped skyrmion strings to Y-, X-, and O-shaped ones. Besides, different
branches of a bifurcated skyrmion string may merge into an isolated skyrmion

theory, to calculate the second derivative, or the Hessian matrix, of the free
energy surface of a biomolecule in aqueous solution, which consists of the
intramolecular interaction among atoms in the biomolecule and the solvation
free energy. The method is applied to calculate the wave-number spectrum of an
alanine dipeptide in water for which the optical heterodyne-detected
Raman-induced spectroscopy (RIKES) spectrum is available to compare with. The
theoretical analysis reproduced the main features of the experimental spectrum
with respect to the peak positions of the four bands around ~90 cm-1, ~240
cm-1, ~370 cm-1, and 400 cm-1, observed in the experimental spectrum, in spite
that the physics involved in the two spectrum was not exactly the same: the
experimental spectrum includes the contributions from the dipeptide and the
water molecules interacting with the solute, while the theoretical one is just
concerned with the solute molecule, influenced by solvation. Two major
discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental spectra, one in the band
intensity around ~100 cm-1, and the other in the peak positions around ~370
cm-1, are discussed in terms of the fluctuation mode of water molecules
interacting with the dipeptide, which is not taken explicitly into account in

classification performance of machine learning models is normalization, such as
z-score. However, normalization is not used in most EMG-based motion prediction
studies, because of the need for calibration and fluctuation of reference value
for calibration (cannot re-use). Therefore, in this study, we proposed a
normalization method that combines sliding-window analysis and z-score
normalization, that can be implemented in real-time processing without need for
calibration. The effectiveness of this normalization method was confirmed by
conducting a single-joint movement experiment of the elbow and predicting its
rest, flexion, and extension movements from the EMG signal. The proposed
normalization method achieved a mean accuracy of 64.6%, an improvement of 15.0%
compared to the non-normalization case (mean of 49.8%). Furthermore, to improve
practical applications, recent research has focused on reducing the user data
required for model learning and improving classification performance in models
learned from other people's data. Therefore, we investigated the classification
performance of the model learned from other's data. Results showed a mean
accuracy of 56.5% when the proposed method was applied, an improvement of 11.1%
compared to the non-normalization case (mean of 44.1%). These two results
showed the effectiveness of the simple and easy-to-implement method, and that

equation is Varadhan's discrete nonlinear semigroup and is also a monotone
scheme that approximates the limiting first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations
(HJE). The discrete Hamiltonian is an m-accretive operator, which generates a
nonlinear semigroup on countable grids and justifies the well-posedness of the
chemical master equation (CME) and the backward equation with 'no reaction'
boundary conditions. The convergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity
solution of HJE is proved by constructing barriers to overcome the polynomial
growth coefficients in the Hamiltonian. This implies the convergence of
Varadhan's discrete nonlinear semigroup to the continuous Lax-Oleinik semigroup
and leads to the large deviation principle for the chemical reaction process at

affects peripheral synovial joints, like fingers, wrist and feet. Radiology
plays a critical role in the diagnosis and monitoring of RA. Limited by the
current spatial resolution of radiographic imaging, joint space narrowing (JSN)
progression of RA with the same reason above can be less than one pixel per
year with universal spatial resolution. Insensitive monitoring of JSN can
hinder the radiologist/rheumatologist from making a proper and timely clinical
judgment. In this paper, we propose a novel and sensitive method that we call
partial image phase-only correlation which aims to automatically quantify JSN
progression in the early stages of RA. The majority of the current literature
utilizes the mean error, root-mean-square deviation and standard deviation to
report the accuracy at pixel level. Our work measures JSN progression between a
baseline and its follow-up finger joint images by using the phase spectrum in
the frequency domain. Using this study, the mean error can be reduced to
0.0130mm when applied to phantom radiographs with ground truth, and 0.0519mm
standard deviation for clinical radiography. With its sub-pixel accuracy far
beyond manual measurement, we are optimistic that our work is promising for
automatically quantifying JSN progression.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a promising distributed
learning paradigm to support intelligent applications at the wireless edge,
where a global model is trained iteratively through the collaboration of the
edge devices without sharing their data. However, due to the relatively large
communication cost between the devices and parameter server (PS), direct
computing based on the information from the devices may not be resource
efficient. This paper studies the joint communication and learning design for
the over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based two-tier wireless FL scheme, where
the lead devices first collect the local gradients from their nearby
subordinate devices, and then send the merged results to the PS for the second
round of aggregation. We establish a convergence result for the proposed scheme
and derive the upper bound on the optimality gap between the expected and
optimal global loss values. Next, based on the device distance and data
importance, we propose a hierarchical clustering method to build the two-tier
structure. Then, with only the instantaneous channel state information (CSI),
we formulate the optimality gap minimization problem and solve it by using an
efficient alternating minimization method. Numerical results show that the
proposed scheme outperforms the baseline ones.

Supervised approaches have pushed performance improvement on style-oriented

that streaming engines constitute complex distributed systems consisting of

synchronization techniques such as the network time protocol (NTP) are limited
to millisecond accuracy, and hence cannot be used.
  We propose a profiling technique that relates the time-stamp counters (TSCs)
of nodes to measure the duration of events in a streaming framework. The
precision of the TSC relation determines the accuracy of the measured duration.
The TSC relation is conducted in quiescent periods of the network to achieve
accuracy in the tens of microseconds. We propose a throughput-controlled data

replacing these exact spatial derivatives with high-order accurate numerical
discretizations computed using meshless radial basis function-finite
differences (RBF-FD) and applied via sparse-matrix vector multiplication. The
use of RBF-FD allows for DT-PINNs to be trained even on point cloud samples
placed on irregular domain geometries. Additionally, though traditional PINNs
(vanilla-PINNs) are typically stored and trained in 32-bit floating-point
(fp32) on the GPU, we show that for DT-PINNs, using fp64 on the GPU leads to
significantly faster training times than fp32 vanilla-PINNs with comparable
accuracy. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of DT-PINNs via a series
of experiments. First, we explore the effect of network depth on both numerical
and automatic differentiation of a neural network with random weights and show
that RBF-FD approximations of third-order accuracy and above are more efficient
while being sufficiently accurate. We then compare the DT-PINNs to
vanilla-PINNs on both linear and nonlinear Poisson equations and show that
DT-PINNs achieve similar losses with 2-4x faster training times on a consumer
GPU. Finally, we also demonstrate that similar results can be obtained for the
PINN solution to the heat equation (a space-time problem) by discretizing the
spatial derivatives using RBF-FD and using automatic differentiation for the
temporal derivative. Our results show that fp64 DT-PINNs offer a superior

directed graphs (digraph) based on the classic Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD), named SVD-GCN. The new graph neural network is built upon the graph
SVD-framelet to better decompose graph signals on the SVD ``frequency'' bands.
Further the new framelet SVD-GCN is also scaled up for larger scale graphs via
using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. Through empirical experiments
conducted on several node classification datasets, we have found that SVD-GCN
has remarkable improvements in a variety of graph node learning tasks and it
outperforms GCN and many other state-of-the-art graph neural networks for
digraphs. Moreover, we empirically demonstate that the SVD-GCN has great
denoising capability and robustness to high level graph data attacks. The
theoretical and experimental results prove that the SVD-GCN is effective on a
variant of graph datasets, meanwhile maintaining stable and even better
performance than the state-of-the-arts.

  Planning",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motion planning methods like navigation functions and harmonic potential
fields provide (almost) global convergence and are suitable for obstacle
avoidance in dynamically changing environments due to their reactive nature. A
common assumption in the control design is that the robot operates in a
disjoint star world, i.e. all obstacles are strictly starshaped and mutually
disjoint. However, in real-life scenarios obstacles may intersect due to
expanded obstacle regions corresponding to robot radius or safety margins. To
broaden the applicability of aforementioned reactive motion planning methods,
we propose a method to reshape a workspace of intersecting obstacles into a
disjoint star world. The algorithm is based on two novel concepts presented
here, namely admissible kernel and starshaped hull with specified kernel, which
are closely related to the notion of starshaped hull. The utilization of the
proposed method is illustrated with examples of a robot operating in a 2D
workspace using a harmonic potential field approach in combination with the
developed algorithm.

The present study aims at providing a deeper insight into the power and
limitation of an unsupervised classification algorithm (called Fisher-EM) on
spectra of galaxies. This algorithm uses a Gaussian mixture in a discriminative
latent subspace. To this end, we investigate the capacity of this algorithm to
segregate the physical parameters used to generate mock spectra and the
influence of the noise on the classification. Methods. With the code CIGALE and
different values for nine input parameters characterising the stellar
population, we have simulated a sample of 11 475 optical spectra of galaxies
containing 496 monochromatic fluxes. The statistical model and the optimum
number of clusters is given in Fisher-EM by the integrated completed likelihood
(ICL) criterion. We repeated the analyses several times to assess the
robustness of the results. Results. Two distinct classifications can be
distinguished in the case of the noiseless spectra. The one above 13 clusters
disappears when noise is added, while the classification with 12 clusters is
very robust against noise down to a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 3. At SNR=1,
the optimum is 5 clusters, but the classification is still compatible with the
previous one. The distribution of the parameters used for the simulation shows
an excellent discrimination between classes. A higher dispersion both in the
spectra within each class and in the parameter distribution, leads us to
conclude that despite a much higher ICL, the classification with more than 13
clusters in the noiseless case is not physically relevant. Conclusions. This
study yields two conclusions valid at least for the Fisher-EM algorithm.
Firstly, the unsupervised classification of spectra of galaxies is both
reliable and robust to noise. Secondly, such analyses are able to extract the
useful physical information contained in the spectra and to build highly
meaningful classifications. In an epoch of data-driven astrophysics, it is
important to trust unsupervised machine learning approaches that do not require
training samples which are unavoidably biased.

learning from a non-i.i.d data stream continually. Due to the single-pass
training setting, online continual learning is very challenging, but it is
closer to the real-world scenarios where quick adaptation to new data is
appealing. In this paper, we focus on online class-incremental learning setting
in which new classes emerge over time. Almost all existing methods are
replay-based with a softmax classifier. However, the inherent logits bias
problem in the softmax classifier is a main cause of catastrophic forgetting
while existing solutions are not applicable for online settings. To bypass this
problem, we abandon the softmax classifier and propose a novel generative
framework based on the feature space. In our framework, a generative classifier
which utilizes replay memory is used for inference, and the training objective
is a pair-based metric learning loss which is proven theoretically to optimize
the feature space in a generative way. In order to improve the ability to learn
new data, we further propose a hybrid of generative and discriminative loss to
train the model. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including newly
introduced task-free datasets, show that our method beats a series of
state-of-the-art replay-based methods with discriminative classifiers, and
reduces catastrophic forgetting consistently with a remarkable margin.

line intensity mapping (LIM) also offers a unique window into the astrophysics
of galaxy evolution. Adding to the astrophysical explorations of LIM technique
that have traditionally focused on small, non-linear scales, we present a novel
method to study the global star formation law using forthcoming data from
large-scale baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) intensity mapping. Using the
amplitude of the percent-level but scale-dependent bias induced by baryon
fraction fluctuations on BAO scales, we show that combining auto- and
cross-correlation power spectra of two (or more) LIM signals allows to probe
the star formation law power index $\mathcal{N}$. We examine the prospect for
mapping H$\alpha$ and [OIII] lines across all scales, especially where imprints
of the baryon fraction deviation exist, with space missions like SPHEREx. We
show that although SPHEREx may only marginally probe $\mathcal{N}$ by accessing
a modest number of large-scale modes in its 200 deg$^2$ deep survey, future
infrared all-sky surveys reaching a comparable depth with an improved spectral
resolution ($R \gtrsim 400$) are likely to constrain $\mathcal{N}$ to a
precision of 10$-$30%, sufficient for distinguishing models with varying
feedback assumptions, out to $z\sim4$ using BAO intensity mapping. Leveraging

and future transits predicted. We report photometric observations of four
transits of K2-139 b with ESA's CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS),
conducted with the goal of measuring the orbital obliquity via spot-crossing
events. We jointly fit these CHEOPS data alongside the three
previously-published transits from the K2 mission, considerably increasing the
precision of the ephemeris of K2-139 b. The transit times for this system can
now be predicted for the next decade with a $1 \sigma$ precision less than 10
minutes, compared to over one hour previously, allowing the efficient
scheduling of observations with Ariel. We detect no significant deviation from
a linear ephemeris, allowing us to exclude the presence of a massive outer
planet orbiting with a period less than 150 d, or a brown dwarf with a period
less than one year. We also determine the scaled semi-major axis, the impact
parameter, and the stellar limb-darkening with improved precision. This is
driven by the shorter cadence of the CHEOPS observations compared to that of
K2, and validates the sub-exposure technique used for analysing long-cadence
photometry. Finally, we note that the stellar spot configuration has changed
from the epoch of the K2 observations; unlike the K2 transits, we detect no
evidence of spot-crossing events in the CHEOPS data.

We then introduce $Sigma$, a new Subtitle Segmentation Score derived from an

searches for patterns through clustering to identify possible 'blobs' in the

Our unsupervised clustering is based on geometrical and spectral constraints

trade-off between achieving a desired broad-angle response and reducing the
thickness of the device. It originates from the Fourier transform duality
between space and angle. One can write down the transmission matrix describing
the desired angle-dependent response, convert it to the spatial basis where its
degree of nonlocality can be quantified through a lateral spreading, and
determine the minimal device thickness based on such a required lateral

predicts the minimal thickness as a function of the FOV, lens diameter, and
numerical aperture. The bound is tight, as some inverse-designed multi-layer
metasurfaces can approach the minimal thickness we found. This work offers
guidance for the design of nonlocal metasurfaces, proposes a new framework for
establishing bounds, and reveals the relation between angular diversity and

as a test for general autonomous driving by pushing perception, planning, and
control algorithms to their limits. While traditional control methods such as
MPC are capable of generating an optimal control sequence at the edge of the
vehicles physical controllability, these methods are sensitive to the accuracy
of the modeling parameters. This paper presents TC-Driver, a RL approach for
robust control in autonomous racing. In particular, the TC-Driver agent is
conditioned by a trajectory generated by any arbitrary traditional high-level
planner. The proposed TC-Driver addresses the tire parameter modeling
inaccuracies by exploiting the heuristic nature of RL while leveraging the
reliability of traditional planning methods in a hierarchical control
structure. We train the agent under varying tire conditions, allowing it to
generalize to different model parameters, aiming to increase the racing
capabilities of the system in practice. The proposed RL method outperforms a
non-learning-based MPC with a 2.7 lower crash ratio in a model mismatch
setting, underlining robustness to parameter discrepancies. In addition, the
average RL inference duration is 0.25 ms compared to the average MPC solving
time of 11.5 ms, yielding a nearly 40-fold speedup, allowing for complex
control deployment in computationally constrained devices. Lastly, we show that
the frequently utilized end-to-end RL architecture, as a control policy
directly learned from sensory input, is not well suited to model mismatch
robustness nor track generalization. Our realistic simulations show that
TC-Driver achieves a 6.7 and 3-fold lower crash ratio under model mismatch and
track generalization settings, while simultaneously achieving lower lap times
than an end-to-end approach, demonstrating the viability of TC-driver to robust
autonomous racing.

the most challenging part of monocular 3D object detection (M3OD). Many
existing methods rely on preconceived assumptions to bridge the missing spatial
information in monocular images, and predict a sole depth value for every
object of interest. However, these assumptions do not always hold in practical
applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a depth solving system that
fully explores the visual clues from the subtasks in M3OD and generates
multiple estimations for the depth of each target. Since the depth estimations
rely on different assumptions in essence, they present diverse distributions.
Even if some assumptions collapse, the estimations established on the remaining
assumptions are still reliable. In addition, we develop a depth selection and
combination strategy. This strategy is able to remove abnormal estimations
caused by collapsed assumptions, and adaptively combine the remaining
estimations into a single one. In this way, our depth solving system becomes
more precise and robust. Exploiting the clues from multiple subtasks of M3OD
and without introducing any extra information, our method surpasses the current
best method by more than 20% relatively on the Moderate level of test split in
the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, while still maintaining real-time

which length is constant (the rigid constraint). The energy of the rigid
dumbbell consists only on the kinetic energy. Also, only the deformations which
do not violate the rigid constraint are allowed. Thus we need the dynamic
equations which is consistent with the rigid constraint to apply the virtual

dynamic equations into the forms which are consistent with the rigid

the obtained dynamic equations. We derive the stress tensor for the rigid

sea-ice extent are submitted to singular spectral analysis (SSA). The
components are analyzed with Laplace's formulation of the Liouville-Euler
system. As already shown in a previous work, the trends observed in the time
series are quasi linear, decreasing for NHSI and increasing for SHSI. The
amplitude of annual variations in the Antarctic is double that in the Arctic,
they are in phase opposition, modulated. The semi-annual components are in
quadrature. The first 3 components of both NHSI and SHSI at 1, 1/2 and 1/3 yr
account for more than 95% of the signal variance. We complement previous
analyses of variations in pole position (PM = m1, m2) and length of day (lod).
Whereas SSA of lod is dominated by the same first 3 components as sea-ice, SSA
of PM contains only the 1 yr and the Chandler components. The 1 yr component of
NHSI is in phase with that of lod and in phase opposition with m1. The reverse
holds for the 1 yr component of SHSI. We note that the semi-annual component
appears in lod not in m1. The annual and semi-annual components of NHSI and
SHSI are much larger than the trends observed since 1978, that leads us to test
whether a first order geophysical or astronomical forcing should not be
preferred to the mechanisms generally suggested as a forcing factor of the
trends. The lack of modulation of the largest forced component suggests an
alternate mechanism. In Laplace's paradigm, the torques exerted by the Moon,
Sun and planets play the leading role as the source of forcing of many
geophysical phenomena. These forces lead to changes in the inclination of the
Earth's rotation axis, setting Earth masses in motion and resulting in thermal
dissipation. It is variations in inclination of the rotation axis that lead to
the large annual components of melting and re-freezing of sea-ice.

have been various proposals for software application domain classification over
the past years. However, these approaches lack a well-defined taxonomy that is
hierarchical, grounded in a knowledge base, and free of irrelevant terms. This
work proposes GitRanking, a framework for creating a classification ranked into
discrete levels based on how general or specific their meaning is. We collected
121K topics from GitHub and considered $60\%$ of the most frequent ones for the
ranking. GitRanking 1) uses active sampling to ensure a minimal number of
required annotations; and 2) links each topic to Wikidata, reducing ambiguities
and improving the reusability of the taxonomy. Our results show that
developers, when annotating their projects, avoid using terms with a high
degree of specificity. This makes the finding and discovery of their projects
more challenging for other users. Furthermore, we show that GitRanking can
effectively rank terms according to their general or specific meaning. This
ranking would be an essential asset for developers to build upon, allowing them
to complement their annotations with more precise topics. Finally, we show that
GitRanking is a dynamically extensible method: it can currently accept further
terms to be ranked with a minimum number of annotations ($\sim$ 15). This paper
is the first collective attempt to build a ground-up taxonomy of software

remains to be determined whether neutrino-neutrino coherent scattering can give
rise to nontrivial quantum entanglement among neutrinos, and whether this can
affect the flavor evolution in a meaningful way. To gain further insight into
this question, here we study a simple system of two interacting neutrino beams,
and obtain the exact phase-space explored by this system using the Husimi
quasi-probability distribution. We observe that the entanglement induced by the
coupling leads to strong delocalization in phase-space with largely
non-Gaussian quantum fluctuations. The link between the neutrino entanglement
and quantum fluctuations is illustrated using the one- and two-neutrino
entropy. In addition, we propose an approximate phase-space method to describe
the interacting neutrinos problem, where the exact evolution is replaced by a
set of independent mean-field evolutions with a statistical sampling of the
initial conditions. The phase-space approach provides a simple and accurate
method to describe the gross features of the neutrino entanglement problem.

that retains its pre-impact stratigraphy. We estimated the peak pressure

of this method to produce shocked grains that have experienced different
degrees of metamorphism from a single experiment is an advantage over
conventional uniaxial shock recovery experiments. The shocked samples were
investigated by polarizing microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. We found
that more than half of calcite grains exhibit undulatory extinction when peak
pressure exceeds 3 GPa. This shock pressure is one order of magnitude higher
than the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) of marble, but it is close to the HEL of
a calcite crystal, suggesting that the undulatory extinction records

science have brought unprecedented amount of data to assist transportation
engineers and researchers in making better decisions. However, traffic data in
reality often has corrupted or incomplete values due to detector and
communication malfunctions. Data imputation is thus required to ensure the
effectiveness of downstream data-driven applications. To this end, numerous
tensor-based methods treating the imputation problem as the low-rank tensor
completion (LRTC) have been attempted in previous works. To tackle rank
minimization, which is at the core of the LRTC, most of aforementioned methods
utilize the tensor nuclear norm (NN) as a convex surrogate for the
minimization. However, the over-relaxation issue in NN refrains it from
desirable performance in practice. In this paper, we define an innovative
nonconvex truncated Schatten p-norm for tensors (TSpN) to approximate tensor
rank and impute missing spatiotemporal traffic data under the LRTC framework.
We model traffic data into a third-order tensor structure of (time
intervals,locations (sensors),days) and introduce four complicated missing
patterns, including random missing and three fiber-like missing cases according
to the tensor mode-n fibers. Despite nonconvexity of the objective function in
our model, we derive the global optimal solutions by integrating the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with generalized
soft-thresholding (GST). In addition, we design a truncation rate decay
strategy to deal with varying missing rate scenarios. Comprehensive experiments
are finally conducted using real-world spatiotemporal datasets, which
demonstrate that the proposed LRTC-TSpN method performs well under various
missing cases, meanwhile outperforming other SOTA tensor-based imputation
models in almost all scenarios.

evaluation is time-consuming and uneconomic for all images, while existing
objective methods have limited capabilities for the newly-developed UIE
approaches based on deep learning. To fill this gap, we propose an Underwater
Image Fidelity (UIF) metric for objective evaluation of enhanced underwater
images. By exploiting the statistical features of these images, we present to
extract naturalness-related, sharpness-related, and structure-related features.
Among them, the naturalness-related and sharpness-related features evaluate
visual improvement of enhanced images; the structure-related feature indicates
structural similarity between images before and after UIE. Then, we employ
support vector regression to fuse the above three features into a final UIF
metric. In addition, we have also established a large-scale UIE database with
subjective scores, namely Underwater Image Enhancement Database (UIED), which

multi-stage information retrieval paradigm: matching, pre-ranking, ranking, and
re-ranking stages. To account for system efficiency, simple vector-product
based models are commonly deployed in the pre-ranking stage. Recent works
consider distilling the high knowledge of large ranking models to small
pre-ranking models for better effectiveness. However, two major challenges in
pre-ranking system still exist: (i) without explicitly modeling the performance
gain versus computation cost, the predefined latency constraint in the
pre-ranking stage inevitably leads to suboptimal solutions; (ii) transferring
the ranking teacher's knowledge to a pre-ranking student with a predetermined
handcrafted architecture still suffers from the loss of model performance. In
this work, a novel framework AutoFAS is proposed which jointly optimizes the
efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-ranking model: (i) AutoFAS for the
first time simultaneously selects the most valuable features and network
architectures using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique; (ii) equipped
with ranking model guided reward during NAS procedure, AutoFAS can select the
best pre-ranking architecture for a given ranking teacher without any
computation overhead. Experimental results in our real world search system show
AutoFAS consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches at a lower computing cost. Notably, our model has been adopted in
the pre-ranking module in the search system of Meituan, bringing significant

periodic sampling with period $\delta$; $0<\varepsilon, \delta \ll 1$. Thus,
state samples (measurements) are taken every $\delta$ time units, and the
instantaneous rate of change of the state depends on its current value as well
as its most recent sample. We show that the resulting stochastic process
indexed by $\varepsilon,\delta$, can be approximated, as $\varepsilon,\delta
\searrow 0$, by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with vector field
obtained by replacing the most recent sample by the current value of the state.
We next analyze the fluctuations of the stochastic process about the limiting
ODE. Our main result asserts that, for the case when $\delta \searrow 0$ at the
same rate as, or faster than, $\varepsilon \searrow 0$, the rescaled
fluctuations can be approximated in a suitable strong (pathwise) sense by a
limiting stochastic differential equation (SDE). This SDE varies depending on
the exact rates at which $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0$. The key contribution
here involves computing the effective drift term capturing the interplay
between noise and sampling in the limiting SDE. The results essentially provide
a first-order perturbation expansion, together with error estimates, for the

compressible flows discretized by the use of finite volume approaches. The
basic idea behind this work is the construction of reduced order models capable
of providing fully consistent solutions with respect to the high fidelity flow
fields. Full order solutions are often obtained through the use of segregated
solvers, employing slightly modified conservation laws so that they can be
decoupled and then solved one at a time. Classical reduction architectures, on
the contrary, rely on the Galerkin projection of a complete Navier-Stokes
system to be projected all at once, causing a mild discrepancy with the high
order solutions. In this article we rely on segregated reduced order algorithms
for the resolution of turbulent and compressible flows in the context of
physical and geometrical parameters. At the full order level turbulence is
modeled using an eddy viscosity approach. Since there are a variety of
different turbulence models for the approximation of this supplementary
viscosity, one of the aims of this work is to provide reduced order models
which are independent on this selection. This goal is reached by the
application of hybrid methods where Navier-Stokes equations are projected in a
standard way while the viscosity field is approximated by the use of
data-driven interpolation methods or by the evaluation of a properly trained
neural network. By exploiting the aforementioned expedients it is possible to
reduced the computational cost associated wit fluid flow problems characterized
by high Reynolds numbers and elevated Mach numbers.

the thermalization process in the weak coupling model with a process comprising
thermalization and decoupling. The efficiency of the proposed model is
analytically calculated and it indicates that when the contribution of the
interaction terms is neglected in the weak interaction limit, it reduces to
that of the earlier model. The sufficient condition for the efficiency of the

find some correlations and patterns that can help predict and ultimately
prevent failures. Equipment in manufacturing industry are often utilized
without a planned maintenance approach. Such practise frequently results in
unexpected downtime, owing to certain unexpected failures. In scheduled
maintenance, the condition of the manufacturing equipment is checked after
fixed time interval and if any fault occurs, the component is replaced to avoid
unexpected equipment stoppages. On the flip side, this leads to increase in
time for which machine is non-functioning and cost of carrying out the
maintenance. The emergence of Industry 4.0 and smart systems have led to
increasing emphasis on predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies that can reduce

for potential applications of quantum computers. This is particularly true for
those available in the near term, so called noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices. In this Thesis, we develop and study three quantum machine
learning applications suitable for NISQ computers, ordered in terms of
increasing complexity of data presented to them. These algorithms are
variational in nature and use parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) as the
underlying quantum machine learning model. The first application area is
quantum classification using PQCs, where the data is classical feature vectors
and their corresponding labels. Here, we study the robustness of certain data
encoding strategies in such models against noise present in a quantum computer.
The second area is generative modelling using quantum computers, where we use
quantum circuit Born machines to learn and sample from complex probability
distributions. We discuss and present a framework for quantum advantage for
such models, propose gradient-based training methods and demonstrate these both
numerically and on the Rigetti quantum computer up to 28 qubits. For our final
application, we propose a variational algorithm in the area of approximate
quantum cloning, where the data becomes quantum in nature. For the algorithm,
we derive differentiable cost functions, prove theoretical guarantees such as
faithfulness, and incorporate state of the art methods such as quantum
architecture search. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this algorithm is useful
in discovering novel implementable attacks on quantum cryptographic protocols,
focusing on quantum coin flipping and key distribution as examples.

uses partitions to scale a topic across many brokers for producers to write

though Apache Kafka provides some out of the box optimizations, it does not
strictly define how each topic shall be efficiently distributed into
partitions. The well-formulated fine-tuning that is needed in order to improve
an Apache Kafka cluster performance is still an open research problem. In this
paper, we first model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given
topic. Then, given the set of brokers, constraints and application requirements
on throughput, OS load, replication latency and unavailability, we formulate
the optimization problem of finding how many partitions are needed and show
that it is computationally intractable, being an integer program. Furthermore,
we propose two simple, yet efficient heuristics to solve the problem: the first
tries to minimize and the second to maximize the number of brokers used in the
cluster. Finally, we evaluate its performance via large-scale simulations,
considering as benchmarks some Apache Kafka cluster configuration
recommendations provided by Microsoft and Confluent. We demonstrate that,
unlike the recommendations, the proposed heuristics respect the hard

and inaccurate health information across social media. Detecting misinformation
amidst dynamically changing information landscape is challenging; identifying
relevant keywords and posts is arduous due to the large amount of human effort
required to inspect the content and sources of posts. We aim to reduce the
resource cost of this process by introducing a weakly-supervised iterative
graph-based approach to detect keywords, topics, and themes related to
misinformation, with a focus on COVID-19. Our approach can successfully detect
specific topics from general misinformation-related seed words in a few seed
texts. Our approach utilizes the BERT-based Word Graph Search (BWGS) algorithm
that builds on context-based neural network embeddings for retrieving
misinformation-related posts. We utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
topic modeling for obtaining misinformation-related themes from the texts
returned by BWGS. Furthermore, we propose the BERT-based Multi-directional Word
Graph Search (BMDWGS) algorithm that utilizes greater starting context
information for misinformation extraction. In addition to a qualitative
analysis of our approach, our quantitative analyses show that BWGS and BMDWGS
are effective in extracting misinformation-related content compared to common
baselines in low data resource settings. Extracting such content is useful for
uncovering prevalent misconceptions and concerns and for facilitating precision
public health messaging campaigns to improve health behaviors.

autonomous driving, especially for the information fusion of collective
perception that aims to further improve road safety by sharing information in a
communication network of ConnectedAutonomous Vehicles (CAV). In this scenario,
small localization errors can impose additional difficulty on fusing the
information from different CAVs. In this paper, we propose a RANSAC-based
(RANdom SAmple Consensus) method to correct the relative localization errors
between two CAVs in order to ease the information fusion among the CAVs.
Different from previous LiDAR-based localization algorithms that only take the
static environmental information into consideration, this method also leverages
the dynamic objects for localization thanks to the real-time data sharing
between CAVs. Specifically, in addition to the static objects like poles,
fences, and facades, the object centers of the detected dynamic vehicles are
also used as keypoints for the matching of two point sets. The experiments on
the synthetic dataset COMAP show that the proposed method can greatly decrease
the relative localization error between two CAVs to less than 20cmas far as
there are enough vehicles and poles are correctly detected by bothCAVs.
Besides, our proposed method is also highly efficient in runtime and can be
used in real-time scenarios of autonomous driving.

messages from the base station (BS) to multiple mobile users (MUs). The
multicast scheduling problem over multiple channels, which jointly minimizes
the energy consumption of the BS and the latency of serving asynchronized
requests from the MUs, is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision
process (MDP) with large discrete action space, multiple time-varying
constraints, and multiple time-invariant constraints, which has not been
efficiently solved in the literatures. To address this problem, this paper
proposes a novel algorithm called distribution-embedding multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (DE-MAPPO), which consists of two parts: a modified MAPPO
module and a distribution-embedding module. The former one modifies MAPPO's
offline training and online applying mechanisms to handle the large discrete
action space issue and time-varying constraints, and the latter one iteratively
adjusts the action distribution to satisfy the time-invariant constraints.
Moreover, as a benchmark, a performance upper bound of the considered MDP is
derived by solving a two-step optimization problem. Numerical experiments show
that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable performance to the derived
benchmark in typical scenarios.

and examine strongly nonlinear superlattice models (three triatomic models) to
show the evolution process of typical nonlinear band structures based on
analytical and numerical approaches. We find that the strongly nonlinear
superlattices present particular band degeneration and bifurcation, accompanied
with the vibration mode transfer in their unit cells. The evolution processes
and the physical mechanisms of the band degeneration in different models are
clarified with the consideration of the mode transfer. The observed
degeneration may occur as the shifting, bifurcating, shortening, merging or
disappearing of dispersion curves, all depending on the arrangement of the
coupled nonlinear elements. Meanwhile, the dimension of the unit cell reduces,
alongside changes in the frequency range and mechanisms (Bragg and local

The knots exhibit rich ro-vibrational spectra of H$_2$, consistent with
shock-excited excitation, from which radial velocities and relevant physical

estimating extinction ranges towards several features. [FeII] emission was only

outflows are close to the plane of the sky. Nearby knots in the same chain
often display different radial velocities, both blue-shifted and red-shifted,
which we interpret as due to ubiquitous jet precession in the driving sources
or the development of oblique shocks. One of the chains (strand A) appears as a
set of features trailing a leading bow-shock structure consistent with the
results of 3-D magneto-hydrodynamical models. Either side of the leading

size of TiFeMn on the activation process is systematically studied. The results
obtained from this investigation suggest that the activation of the TiFeMn
material at temperatures as low as 50 {\deg}C is already possible and that an
increase to 90 {\deg}C strongly reduces the incubation time for activation,
i.e. the incubation time of the 90 {\deg}C/90 {\deg}C sample is about 0.84 h
while ~ 277 h is required for the 50 {\deg}C/50 {\deg}C sample. Selecting
TiFeMn particles of larger size also leads to significant improvements in the
activation performance of the investigated material. The proposed activation
routine makes it possible to overcome the oxide layer existing on the compound
surface, which acts as a diffusion barrier for the hydrogen atoms. This
activation method induces further cracks and defects in the powder granules,
generating new surfaces for hydrogen absorption with greater frequency, and
thus leading to faster sorption kinetics in the subsequent

show that these approaches are not incompatible: biomimetic wing morphing is an
avenue both to classical supermanoeuvrability, and to new forms of
biologically-inspired supermanoeuvrability. Using a state-of-the-art flight
simulator, equipped with a multibody model of lifting surface motion and a

capability of a biomimetic morphing-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for two

can be performed, and their feasibility in practical biomimetic unmanned aerial

supermanoeuvrable UAVs, and the study of biological flight dynamics across

fields, a Kochen-Specker-type reasoning is usually formulated for just one
particle, or like in the case of Peres-Mermin square for two. A question
emerges. Is it possible to formulate a contextuality proof for situation in
which the numbers of particles are fundamentally undefined? We address this
problem for bosonic fields. We introduce a representation of the
$\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra in terms of boson number states in two modes that
allows us to assess nonclassicality of states of bosonic fields. As a figure of
merit of a nonclassical behaviour we analyze first of all contextuality, and we
show that the introduced observables are handy and efficient to reveal
violation of local realism, and to formulate entanglement indicators. We
construct a method which extends the Kochen-Specker contextuality to bosonic
quantum fields. A form of an inequality is derived using a suitable version of
the Peres-Mermin square. The entanglement indicators use a witness built with
specially defined Pauli-like observables. Finally, Bell-nonclassicality is
discussed: an inequality that involves the expectation values of pairs of the
Pauli-like operators is presented. The introduced indicators are shown to be
effective, e.g. they reveal nonclassicality in situaations involving undefined
boson numbers. This is shown via quantum optical examples of the $2\times 2$
bright squeezed vacuum state, and a recently discussed bright-GHZ state

declines, differs slightly from that of generalist predation in other
mechanistic models of rodent-mustelid interactions such as Turchin & Hanski

generalist-induced declines. This simpler model should be broadly applicable to

remains under debate, and likely has key implications for solar wind heating
and acceleration. Here, using three-dimensional expanding box simulations, we
examine the properties of switchbacks arising from the evolution of
outwards-propagating Alfv\'en waves in the expanding solar wind in detail. Our
goal is to provide testable predictions that can be used to differentiate
between properties arising from solar surface processes and those from the
in-situ evolution of Alfv\'en waves in switchback observations by PSP. We show
how the inclusion of the Parker spiral causes magnetic field deflections within
switchbacks to become asymmetric, preferentially deflecting in the plane of the
Parker spiral and rotating in one direction towards the radial component of the
mean field. The direction of the peak of the magnetic field distribution is
also shown to be different from the mean field direction due to its highly
skewed nature. Compressible properties of switchbacks are also explored, with
magnetic-field-strength and density fluctuations being either correlated or
anticorrelated depending on the value of $\beta$, agreeing with predictions
from theory. We also measure dropouts in magnetic-field strength and density
spikes at the boundaries of these synthetic switchbacks, both of which have
been observed by PSP. The agreement of these properties with observations
provide further support for the Alfv\'en wave model of switchbacks.

we examine bounce cosmology that appears with a Type-IV singularity in the
context of a ghost free Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity. Depending on the time
of occurrence of the Type-IV singularity, three different cases may arise --
when the singularity occurs before the bounce or after the bounce or at the
instant of the bounce respectively. However in all of these cases, we find that
in the case when the singularity ""globally"" affects the spacetime, the scalar
power spectrum becomes red tilted and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is too large
to be consistent with the observational data. Based on these findings, we
investigate a different bouncing scenario which also appears with a Type-IV
singularity, and the singularity affects the spacetime ""locally"" around the
time when it occurs. As a result, and unlike to the previous scenario, the
perturbation modes in the second bouncing scenario are likely to generate far
away from the bounce in the deep contracting phase. This finally results to the
simultaneous compatibility of the observable quantities with the Planck data,
and ensures the viability of the bounce model where the Type-IV singularity has
local effects on the spacetime around the time of the singularity.

have generated significant interest as possible signatures of the key
mechanisms that heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. In this context,
an important task for theories of switchback formation and evolution is to
understand their observable distinguishing features, allowing them to be
assessed in detail using spacecraft data. Here, we work towards this goal by
studying the influence of the Parker spiral on the evolution of Alfv\'enic
switchbacks in an expanding plasma. Using simple analytic arguments based on
the physics of one-dimensional spherically polarized (constant-field-magnitude)
Alfv\'en waves, we find that, by controlling the wave's obliquity, a Parker
spiral strongly impacts switchback properties. Surprisingly, the Parker spiral
can significantly enhance switchback formation, despite normalized wave
amplitudes growing more slowly in its presence. In addition, switchbacks become
strongly asymmetric: large switchbacks preferentially involve magnetic-field
rotation in the plane of the Parker spiral (tangential deflections) rather than
perpendicular (normal) rotations, and such deflections are strongly
""tangentially skewed,"" meaning switchbacks always involve field rotations in
the same direction (towards the positive-radial direction for an outwards mean
field). In a companion paper, we show that these properties also occur in
turbulent 3-D fields with switchbacks, with various caveats. These results
demonstrate that substantial care is needed in assuming that specific features
of switchbacks can be used to infer properties of the low corona; asymmetries
and nontrivial correlations can develop as switchbacks propagate due to the
interplay between expansion and spherically polarized, divergence-free magnetic
fields.

correlations between the layer-wise representations, to derive insights on the
relationship between neural representations and performance.
  Previous investigations of network similarities using correlation analysis
techniques have not been explored for End-to-End ASR models. This paper
analyses and explores the internal dynamics between layers during training with
CNN, LSTM and Transformer based approaches using Canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) and centered kernel alignment (CKA) for the experiments. It was found
that neural representations within CNN layers exhibit hierarchical correlation
dependencies as layer depth increases but this is mostly limited to cases where
neural representation correlates more closely. This behaviour is not observed
in LSTM architecture, however there is a bottom-up pattern observed across the
training process, while Transformer encoder layers exhibit irregular
coefficiency correlation as neural depth increases. Altogether, these results
provide new insights into the role that neural architectures have upon speech
recognition performance. More specifically, these techniques can be used as
indicators to build better performing speech recognition models.

with two-dimensional architectures (those with only width and depth as
hyper-parameters), e.g., standard fully connected networks. The new network
architecture is constructed recursively via a nested structure, and hence we
call a network with the new architecture nested network (NestNet). A NestNet of
height $s$ is built with each hidden neuron activated by a NestNet of height
$\le s-1$. When $s=1$, a NestNet degenerates to a standard network with a
two-dimensional architecture. It is proved by construction that height-$s$ ReLU
NestNets with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ parameters can approximate $1$-Lipschitz
continuous functions on $[0,1]^d$ with an error $\mathcal{O}(n^{-(s+1)/d})$,
while the optimal approximation error of standard ReLU networks with
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ parameters is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-2/d})$. Furthermore, such a
result is extended to generic continuous functions on $[0,1]^d$ with the
approximation error characterized by the modulus of continuity. Finally, we use
numerical experimentation to show the advantages of the super-approximation
power of ReLU NestNets.

characteristic curve (AUC) with minimum cardinality of the feature subset. In
todays world, a humungous amount of data is generated in all activities of

a need to develop parallel and scalable frameworks. In the first-of-its-kind
study, we propose and develop an iterative MapReduce-based framework for
bi-objective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) based wrappers under Apache spark
with the migration strategy. In order to accomplish this, we parallelized the
non-dominated sorting based algorithms namely non dominated sorting algorithm

the decomposition-based algorithm, namely the multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA-D), and named them P-NSGA-II-IS,

incorporating the non-dominated sorting principle while parallelizing it.
Throughout the study, AUC is computed by logistic regression (LR). We test the
effectiveness of the proposed methodology on various datasets. It is noteworthy
that the P-NSGA-II turns out to be statistically significant by being in the
top 2 positions on most datasets. We also reported the empirical attainment

Planck telescopes out to the cluster's virial radius. The analysis confirms the
original findings of a strong excess of soft X--ray radiation, which is likely
to be of thermal origin. We find quantitative agreement between the detected
soft excess and the physical characteristics of warm--hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM) filaments seen in hydrodynamical simulations. We conclude that the most
plausible explanation for the soft excess is the presence of $\sim
10$~Mpc--long filaments at $\log T(K)\simeq 6$, with a baryon overdensity $\sim
300$, converging towards the Coma cluster. This interpretation therefore
provides support for the identification of the missing low--redshift baryons

with scalar hair in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories, which
can be embedded in gauged supergravities for specific dilaton coupling
constants. These accelerating black holes are described by charged dilaton C
metrics, which have unique features but are almost unexplored before.
Thermodynamics of slowly accelerating black holes is generalized to include
scalar hair. We find that properly accounting for mixed boundary conditions for
the scalar field leads to standard consistent first law and other thermodynamic
relations. We compute the dual stress-energy tensor and the mass through
holographic renormalization, which is associated with the boundary conditions
of the scalar field. We also find that the conformal mass is the same as the
holographic mass. Along the same line, we also obtain the thermodynamics of
$U(1)^2$-charged accelerating black holes.

interests in training deep learning models over multiple nodes. However, when
it comes to training on cloud clusters, especially across remote clusters, huge
challenges are faced. In this work, we introduce a general framework, Nebula-I,
for collaboratively training deep learning models over remote heterogeneous
clusters, the connections between which are low-bandwidth wide area networks
(WANs). We took natural language processing (NLP) as an example to show how
Nebula-I works in different training phases that include: a) pre-training a
multilingual language model using two remote clusters; and b) fine-tuning a
machine translation model using knowledge distilled from pre-trained models,
which run through the most popular paradigm of recent deep learning. To balance
the accuracy and communication efficiency, in Nebula-I, parameter-efficient
training strategies, hybrid parallel computing methods and adaptive
communication acceleration techniques are jointly applied. Meanwhile, security
strategies are employed to guarantee the safety, reliability and privacy in
intra-cluster computation and inter-cluster communication. Nebula-I is
implemented with the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework, which can support
collaborative training over heterogeneous hardware, e.g. GPU and NPU.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework could substantially
maximize the training efficiency while preserving satisfactory NLP performance.
By using Nebula-I, users can run large-scale training tasks over cloud clusters
with minimum developments, and the utility of existed large pre-trained models
could be further promoted. We also introduced new state-of-the-art results on
cross-lingual natural language inference tasks, which are generated based upon
a novel learning framework and Nebula-I.

global expansion by tracking the variation in magnetic field strength with
increasing heliocentric distance of individual ICME events, finding significant
variability in magnetic field relationships for individual events in comparison
with statistical trends. With the availability of plasma data at 1 AU, the
local expansion at 1 AU can be compared with global expansion rates between 1
AU and Juno. Despite following expected trends, the local and global expansion
rates are only weakly correlated. Finally, for those events with clearly

rope axis as they propagate; we find that 64% of events displayed a decrease in

of the high-redshift UV luminosity functions for primordial galaxies out to
redshift $z\sim 10$, on redshift-dependent halo mass functions in the above DM
scenarios from numerical simulations, and on robust constraints on the
reionization history of the Universe from recent astrophysical and cosmological

characterized by two parameters, namely the escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}$ of
ionizing photons from primordial galaxies, and the limiting UV magnitude
$M_{\rm UV}^{\rm lim}$ down to which the extrapolated UV luminosity functions
are steeply increasing. Second, we perform standard abundance matching of the
UV luminosity function and the halo mass function, obtaining a relationship
between UV luminosity and halo mass whose shape depends on an astroparticle
quantity $X$ specific of each DM scenario (e.g., WDM particle mass); we exploit
such a relation to introduce in the analysis a constraint from primordial
galaxy formation, in terms of the threshold halo mass above which primordial
galaxies can efficiently form stars. Third, we implement a sequential updating
Bayesian MCMC technique to perform joint inference on the three parameters
$f_{\rm esc}$, $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm lim}$, $X$, and to compare the outcomes of

process. Thus, noise removal is necessary to draw conclusions from these data,

We discuss a methodology to learn differential equation(s) using noisy and
irregular sampled measurements. In our methodology, the main innovation can be
seen in the integration of deep neural networks with the neural ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) approach. Precisely, we aim at learning a neural
network that provides (approximately) an implicit representation of the data
and an additional neural network that models the vector fields of the dependent
variables. We combine these two networks by constraining using neural ODEs. The
proposed framework to learn a model describing the vector field is highly
effective under noisy measurements. The approach can handle scenarios where
dependent variables are not available at the same temporal grid. Moreover, a
particular structure, e.g., second-order with respect to time, can easily be
incorporated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for
learning models using data obtained from various differential equations and
present a comparison with the neural ODE method that does not make any special

performance on many fully supervised classification problems. In this paper, we

AdaBoost, AdaPU aims to optimize an empirical exponential loss, but the loss is
based on the PU data, rather than on positive-negative (PN) data. As in
AdaBoost, we learn a weighted combination of weak classifiers by learning one
weak classifier and its weight at a time. However, AdaPU requires a very
different algorithm for learning the weak classifiers and determining their
weights. This is because AdaPU learns a weak classifier and its weight using a
weighted positive-negative (PN) dataset with some negative data weights $-$ the
dataset is derived from the original PU data, and the data weights are
determined by the current weighted classifier combination, but some data
weights are negative. Our experiments showed that AdaPU outperforms neural

processes. Numerical simulations are conducted in a nonperturbative and
non-Markovian SB coupling regime using the hierarchical equations of motion
under these fields at different cycle frequencies. The work applied to the
total system and the heat exchanged with the baths are rigorously evaluated. In
addition, by regarding quasi-static work as free energy, we compute the quantum
thermodynamic variables and analyze the simulation results using thermodynamic
work diagrams for the first time. Analysis of these diagrams indicates that, in
the strong SB coupling region, the fields for the SB interactions are major
sources of work, while in other regions, the field for the subsystem is a
source of work. We find that the maximum efficiency is achieved in the
quasi-static case and is determined solely by the bath temperatures, regardless
of the SB coupling strength, which is a numerical manifestation of Carnot's
theorem.

Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to promising applications in recommendation.
Nevertheless, shallow models especially random-walk-based algorithms fail to
adequately exploit neighbor proximity in sampled subgraphs or sequences due to
their optimization paradigm. GNN-based algorithms suffer from the insufficient
utilization of high-order information and easily cause over-smoothing problems
when stacking too much layers, which may deteriorate the recommendations of
low-degree (long-tail) items, limiting the expressiveness and scalability. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework SAC, namely Spatial Autoregressive
Coding, to solve the above problems in a unified way. To adequately leverage
neighbor proximity and high-order information, we design a novel spatial
autoregressive paradigm. Specifically, we first randomly mask multi-hop
neighbors and embed the target node by integrating all other surrounding
neighbors with an explicit multi-hop attention. Then we reinforce the model to
learn a neighbor-predictive coding for the target node by contrasting the
coding and the masked neighbors' embedding, equipped with a new hard negative
sampling strategy. To learn the minimal sufficient representation for the
target-to-neighbor prediction task and remove the redundancy of neighbors, we
devise Neighbor Information Bottleneck by maximizing the mutual information
between target predictive coding and the masked neighbors' embedding, and
simultaneously constraining those between the coding and surrounding neighbors'
embedding. Experimental results on both public recommendation datasets and a
real scenario web-scale dataset Douyin-Friend-Recommendation demonstrate the
superiority of SAC compared with state-of-the-art methods.

increasing attention for its effectiveness on the target domain without manual

global features for pseudo labels generation, neglecting the local feature that
can provide for the fine-grained information. To handle this issue, we propose
a Learning Feature Fusion (LF2) framework for adaptively learning to fuse
global and local features to obtain a more comprehensive fusion feature

teacher-student training strategy. The average weighting teacher network is
designed to encode global features, while the student network updating at each
iteration is responsible for fine-grained local features. By fusing these
multi-view features, multi-level clustering is adopted to generate diverse
pseudo labels. In particular, a learnable Fusion Module (FM) for giving
prominence to fine-grained local information within the global feature is also
proposed to avoid obscure learning of multiple pseudo labels. Experiments show
that our proposed LF2 framework outperforms the state-of-the-art with 73.5% mAP

the increase and decrease in temperature is impacted with a change in
confinement radius $(r_{c})$. Two independent and generalized scaling ideas
have been applied to modulate the effect of plasma screening constant
($\lambda$) and charge of ion ($Z$) on such systems. Several new relations are
derived to interconnect the original Hamiltonian and two scaled Hamiltonians.
In exponential cosine screened Coulomb potential (ECSCP) (dense) and weakly
coupled plasma (WCP) these scaling relations have provided a linear equation
connecting the critical screening constant $(\lambda^{(c)})$ and $Z$. Their
ratio offers a state-dependent constant, beyond which, a particular state
vanishes. Shannon entropy has been employed to understand the plasma effect on
the ion. With increase in $\lambda$, the accumulation of opposite charge
surrounding the ion increases leading to a reduction in number of bound states.
However, with rise in ionic charge $Z$, this effect can be delayed. The
competing effect of plasma charge density ($n_e$) and temperature in WCP and
ECSCP is investigated. A recently proposed simple virial-like theorem has been
established for these systems. Multipole ($k=1-4$) oscillator strength (OS) and
polarizabilities for these are studied considering $1s, 2s$ states. As a bonus,
analytical closed-form expressions are derived for $f^{(k)}$ and $\alpha^{(k)}

relation labels or descriptions) to assist model learning based on Prototype
Network. However, most of them constrain the prototypes of each relation class
implicitly with relation information, generally through designing complex
network structures, like generating hybrid features, combining with contrastive
learning or attention networks. We argue that relation information can be
introduced more explicitly and effectively into the model. Thus, this paper
proposes a direct addition approach to introduce relation information.
Specifically, for each relation class, the relation representation is first
generated by concatenating two views of relations (i.e., [CLS] token embedding
and the mean value of embeddings of all tokens) and then directly added to the
original prototype for both train and prediction. Experimental results on the
benchmark dataset FewRel 1.0 show significant improvements and achieve
comparable results to the state-of-the-art, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Besides, further analyses verify that
the direct addition is a much more effective way to integrate the relation

(2002)'s identity for free-stream boundary
layers simplifies to the von Karman momentum integral equation relating the
skin-friction coefficient and the momentum thickness when the upper bound in
the integrals used to obtain the identity is taken to be asymptotically large.
If a finite upper bound is used, the terms of the identity depend spuriously on
the bound itself. Differently from channel and pipe flows, the impact of the
Reynolds stresses on the wall-shear stress cannot be quantified in the case of
free-stream boundary layers because the Reynolds stresses disappear from the
identity. The infinite number of alternative identities obtained by performing
additional integrations on the streamwise momentum equation also all simplify
to the von Karman equation. Analogous identities are found for channel flows,
where the relative influence of the physical terms on the wall-shear stress
depends on the number of successive integrations, demonstrating that the
laminar and turbulent contributions to the skin-friction coefficient is only
distinguished in the original identity discovered by Fukagata et al. (2002). In
the limit of large number of integrations, these identities degenerate to the
definition of skin-friction coefficient and a novel two-fold integration
identity is found for channel and pipe flows. In addition, we decompose the
skin-friction coefficient as the sum of the change of integral thicknesses with
the streamwise direction, following the study of Renard & Deck (2016). We
utilize an energy thickness and an inertia thickness, which is composed of a
thickness related to the mean-flow wall-normal convection and a thickness
linked to the streamwise inhomogeneity of the mean streamwise velocity. The
contributions of the different terms of the streamwise momentum equation on the
friction drag is thus quantified by these integral thicknesses.

transfer using a novel style feature representation learning method. A suitable
style representation, as a key component in image stylization tasks, is
essential to achieve satisfactory results. Existing deep neural network based
approaches achieve reasonable results with the guidance from second-order
statistics such as Gram matrix of content features. However, they do not
leverage sufficient style information, which results in artifacts such as local
distortions and style inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose to
learn style representation directly from image features instead of their
second-order statistics, by analyzing the similarities and differences between
multiple styles and considering the style distribution. Specifically, we
present Contrastive Arbitrary Style Transfer (CAST), which is a new style
representation learning and style transfer method via contrastive learning. Our
framework consists of three key components, i.e., a multi-layer style projector
for style code encoding, a domain enhancement module for effective learning of
style distribution, and a generative network for image style transfer. We
conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations comprehensively to demonstrate
that our approach achieves significantly better results compared to those
obtained via state-of-the-art methods. Code and models are available at

aiming to exploit the unique properties of photons. Reinforcement learning is
an important branch of machine learning, and photonic decision-making
principles have been demonstrated with respect to the multi-armed bandit
problems. However, reinforcement learning could involve a massive number of
states, unlike previously demonstrated bandit problems where the number of
states is only one. Q-learning is a well-known approach in reinforcement
learning that can deal with many states. The architecture of Q-learning,
however, does not fit well photonic implementations due to its separation of
update rule and the action selection. In this study, we organize a new
architecture for multi-state reinforcement learning as a parallel array of
bandit problems in order to benefit from photonic decision-makers, which we
call parallel bandit architecture for reinforcement learning or PBRL in short.
Taking a cart-pole balancing problem as an instance, we demonstrate that PBRL
adapts to the environment in fewer time steps than Q-learning. Furthermore,
PBRL yields faster adaptation when operated with a chaotic laser time series
than the case with uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers where the
autocorrelation inherent in the laser chaos provides a positive effect. We also
find that the variety of states that the system undergoes during the learning
phase exhibits completely different properties between PBRL and Q-learning. The
insights obtained through the present study are also beneficial for existing
computing platforms, not just photonic realizations, in accelerating
performances by the PBRL algorithms and correlated random sequences.

This results in a deterministic encoding of the data, as opposed to the
stochastic encoding of VAEs. The paper introduces two related families of AEFs.
The first family relies on a partition of the ambient space and is trained by
exact maximum-likelihood. The second family exploits a deterministic expansion
of the ambient space and is trained by maximizing the log-probability in this
extended space. This latter case leaves complete freedom in the choice of
encoder, decoder and prior architectures, making it a drop-in replacement for
the training of existing VAEs and VAE-style models. We show that these AEFs can
have strikingly higher performance than architecturally identical VAEs in terms
of log-likelihood and sample quality, especially for low dimensional latent
spaces. Importantly, we show that AEF samples are substantially sharper than

mimics the process of natural selection by iteratively alternating between
mutagenesis and screening in order to search for sequences that optimize a
given property of interest, such as catalytic activity and binding affinity to
a specified target. However, the space of possible proteins is too large to
search exhaustively in the laboratory, and functional proteins are scarce in
the vast sequence space. Machine learning (ML) approaches can accelerate
directed evolution by learning to map protein sequences to functions without
building a detailed model of the underlying physics, chemistry and biological
pathways. Despite the great potentials held by these ML methods, they encounter
severe challenges in identifying the most suitable sequences for a targeted
function. These failures can be attributed to the common practice of adopting a
high-dimensional feature representation for protein sequences and inefficient
search methods. To address these issues, we propose an efficient, experimental
design-oriented closed-loop optimization framework for protein directed
evolution, termed ODBO, which employs a combination of novel low-dimensional
protein encoding strategy and Bayesian optimization enhanced with search space
prescreening via outlier detection. We further design an initial sample
selection strategy to minimize the number of experimental samples for training
ML models. We conduct and report four protein directed evolution experiments

variants with properties of interest. We expect the ODBO framework to greatly
reduce the experimental cost and time cost of directed evolution, and can be
further generalized as a powerful tool for adaptive experimental design in a

Hadronic emission from magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around central black

the MAD by magnetic reconnection and stochastic turbulence acceleration. We
pick out the fifteen brightest radio galaxies in the GeV band from the Fermi

in the GeV bands by the MAD model if the accretion rate is lower than 0.1% of
the Eddington rate. For a higher accretion rate, GeV gamma-rays are absorbed by
two-photon interaction due to copious low-energy photons. If we assume another
proposed prescription of the electron heating rate by magnetic reconnection,
the MAD model fails to reproduce the GeV data for the majority of our sample.
This indicates that the electron heating rate is crucial. We also apply the MAD
model to Sgr A* and find that GeV gamma-rays observed at the Galactic center do
not come from the MAD of Sgr A*. We estimate the cosmic ray intensity from Sgr
A*, but it is too low to explain the high-energy cosmic ray intensity on Earth.

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been attracting increasing
interest recently. However, most existing work focuses on detecting static FBNs
from entire fMRI signals, such as correlation-based functional connectivity.
Sliding-window is a widely used strategy to capture the dynamics of FBNs, but
it is still limited in representing intrinsic functional interactive dynamics
at each time step. And the number of FBNs usually need to be set manually. More
over, due to the complexity of dynamic interactions in brain, traditional
linear and shallow models are insufficient in identifying complex and spatially
overlapped FBNs across each time step. In this paper, we propose a novel
Spatial and Channel-wise Attention Autoencoder (SCAAE) for discovering FBNs
dynamically. The core idea of SCAAE is to apply attention mechanism to FBNs
construction. Specifically, we designed two attention modules: 1) spatial-wise
attention (SA) module to discover FBNs in the spatial domain and 2) a
channel-wise attention (CA) module to weigh the channels for selecting the FBNs
automatically. We evaluated our approach on ADHD200 dataset and our results
indicate that the proposed SCAAE method can effectively recover the dynamic
changes of the FBNs at each fMRI time step, without using sliding windows. More
importantly, our proposed hybrid attention modules (SA and CA) do not enforce
assumptions of linearity and independence as previous methods, and thus provide
a novel approach to better understanding dynamic functional brain networks.

applications, but their characteristics are under-explored. Yet largely
imperceptible, a strong trace could have been left by PGD-like attacks in an
adversarial example. Recall that PGD-like attacks trigger the ``local
linearity'' of a network, which implies different extents of linearity for
benign or adversarial examples. Inspired by this, we construct an Adversarial
Response Characteristics (ARC) feature to reflect the model's gradient
consistency around the input to indicate the extent of linearity. Under certain
conditions, it qualitatively shows a gradually varying pattern from benign
example to adversarial example, as the latter leads to Sequel Attack Effect
(SAE). To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of ARC, we conduct
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet for attack detection and attack type
recognition in a challenging setting. The results suggest that SAE is an
effective and unique trace of PGD-like attacks reflected through the ARC
feature. The ARC feature is intuitive, light-weighted, non-intrusive, and

simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists
of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in
parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined, and
multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image
reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo

learning models have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial samples.
However, existing physical attack methods do not pay enough attention on
transferability to unseen models, thus leading to the poor performance of
black-box attack.In this paper, we put forward a novel method of generating
physically realizable adversarial camouflage to achieve transferable attack
against detection models. More specifically, we first introduce multi-scale
attention maps based on detection models to capture features of objects with
various resolutions. Meanwhile, we adopt a sequence of composite
transformations to obtain the averaged attention maps, which could curb
model-specific noise in the attention and thus further boost transferability.
Unlike the general visualization interpretation methods where model attention
should be put on the foreground object as much as possible, we carry out attack
on separable attention from the opposite perspective, i.e. suppressing
attention of the foreground and enhancing that of the background. Consequently,
transferable adversarial camouflage could be yielded efficiently with our novel
attention-based loss function. Extensive comparison experiments verify the
superiority of our method to state-of-the-art methods.

coupling. This analysis sheds new light on previous claims made in the FEP
literature (and contested in the target article) that the internal dynamics of
stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on variational free
energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if
internal states are performing inference about states external to the system. I
express general agreement with the target article's statement that the marginal
flow of internal states does not point along variational free energy gradients
evaluated at the most likely internal state (i.e., the conditional mode).
However, in this commentary I focus on the flow of particular states (internal
and blanket states) and their variational free energy gradients, and show that
for a wide but restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the average flow of
these systems point along variational free energy gradients. This licenses a
different but perhaps stronger re-description of the flow of particular states
as performing inference, which importantly holds at arbitrary points in state
space, not just at the conditional modes.

drawbacks of time-consuming and error-prone manual delineation procedures are
aimed to be alleviated by atlas-based and supervised machine learning methods
where the former methods are computationally intense and the latter methods
lack a sufficiently large number of labeled data. With this motivation, we
propose CORPS, a semi-supervised segmentation framework built upon a novel
atlas-based pseudo-labeling method and a 3D deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) for 3D brain MRI segmentation. In this work, we propose to generate
expert-level pseudo-labels for unlabeled set of images in an order based on a
local intensity-based similarity score to existing labeled set of images and
using a novel atlas-based label fusion method. Then, we propose to train a 3D
DCNN on the combination of expert and pseudo labeled images for binary
segmentation of each anatomical structure. The binary segmentation approach is
proposed to avoid the poor performance of multi-class segmentation methods on
limited and imbalanced data. This also allows to employ a lightweight and
efficient 3D DCNN in terms of the number of filters and reserve memory
resources for training the binary networks on full-scale and full-resolution 3D
MRI volumes instead of 2D/3D patches or 2D slices. Thus, the proposed framework
can encapsulate the spatial contiguity in each dimension and enhance
context-awareness. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed framework over the baseline method both qualitatively and

entanglement-assisted qubit communication protocols. Using only partial Bell
state analysers for two qubits, we demonstrate quantum correlations that cannot
be simulated with two bits of classical communication. Then, we show that there
exists an established and operationally meaningful task for which product
measurements are sufficient for the strongest possible quantum predictions
based on a maximally entangled two-qubit state. Our results reveal that there
are scenarios in which the power of entanglement in enhancing quantum
communication can be harvested in simple and scalable optical experiments.

joins the plane, the extrusion can range from an infinitesimal bump to a nearly
full sphere that just touches the plane. Free classical motion on this surface
of piecewise uniform curvature follows geodesics that are independent of

deflection magnitude of various needle bevel geometries with varying bevel
lengths. With a conventional lancet, having a 3.9 mm long bevel, the tip
deflection efficiency in air and water was 220 and 105 micrometres per Watt,

bevel length of 4 mm, which achieved a deflection efficiency of 180 and 80

importance of relationship between flexural modulus of bevel geometry in the

  Cut in QFT","34 pages, 14 Figures",,,,"physics.hist-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite quantum theory's remarkable success at predicting the (statistical)
results of experiments, many philosophers worry that it nonetheless lacks some
crucial connection between theory and experiment. Such worries are at the root
of the Quantum Measurement Problem. We can identify two kinds of worries: 1)
pragmatic: it's unclear how to model our experiments to extract theoretical
predictions, and 2) realist: there is no realist narrative for the experiment
underlying these theoretical predictions. While both worries deserve attention,
the pragmatic worries have far worse consequences if left unanswered. Moreover,
as I will argue, upon reflection, a satisfactory explanation of almost all of
quantum theory's experimental successes unavoidably involves modeling quantum
fields at some point. Thus, without a pragmatic theory-to-experiment link for
QFT, we are at risk of losing any right to claim evidential support for large
parts of quantum theory. Hence, I focus on the Pragmatic QFT Measurement
Problem.
  But, what makes modeling measurements in QFT so hard? As I will discuss,
attempts to naively transplant our non-relativistic quantum measurement theory
into QFT are deeply unphysical and unsatisfying. Thus we need a new (or at
least refined) measurement theory for QFT. However, as I will argue, aiming too
directly at a new measurement theory is an incautious way to proceed and is apt
to lead us astray. This paper proposes an alternate way forward: We ought to
first better understand how our non-relativistic quantum measurement theory is
rooted in notions of measurement chains and Heisenberg cuts. Then we ought to
generalize these notions and transplant them into QFT. Such a transplant is
carried out in this paper. My analysis suggests the need for a pragmatic
QFT-cut analogous to the need for a pragmatic Heisenberg cut in
non-relativistic contexts.

overly massive BH galaxy (OMBG), whose nuclear black hole's mass is comparable
to or even greater than the surrounding stellar mass: the black hole to stellar

values at lower redshift. We investigate how long these newborn BHs remain
outliers in the $M_{\rm bh}-M_{*}$ relation, by exploring the subsequent

  Differentiable Classifiers over Continuous Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is broad agreement in the literature that explanation methods should be
faithful to the model that they explain, but faithfulness remains a rather
vague term. We revisit faithfulness in the context of continuous data and
propose two formal definitions of faithfulness for feature attribution methods.
Qualitative faithfulness demands that scores reflect the true qualitative
effect (positive vs. negative) of the feature on the model and quanitative
faithfulness that the magnitude of scores reflect the true quantitative effect.
We discuss under which conditions these requirements can be satisfied to which
extent (local vs global). As an application of the conceptual idea, we look at
differentiable classifiers over continuous data and characterize
Gradient-scores as follows: every qualitatively faithful feature attribution
method is qualitatively equivalent to Gradient-scores. Furthermore, if an
attribution method is quantitatively faithful in the sense that changes of the
output of the classifier are proportional to the scores of features, then it is
either equivalent to gradient-scoring or it is based on an inferior
approximation of the classifier. To illustrate the practical relevance of the
theory, we experimentally demonstrate that popular attribution methods can fail
to give faithful explanations in the setting where the data is continuous and
the classifier differentiable.

mitigate machine learning (ML)-related unfairness in automated decision making
(ADM) by defining metrics that measure fairness of an ML model and by proposing
methods that ensure that trained ML models achieve low values in those
measures. However, the underlying concept of fairness, i.e., the question of
what fairness is, is rarely discussed, leaving a considerable gap between
centuries of philosophical discussion and recent adoption of the concept in the
ML community. In this work, we try to bridge this gap by formalizing a
consistent concept of fairness and by translating the philosophical
considerations into a formal framework for the training and evaluation of ML
models in ADM systems. We derive that fairness problems can already arise
without the presence of protected attributes, pointing out that fairness and
predictive performance are not irreconcilable counterparts, but rather that the
latter is necessary to achieve the former. Moreover, we argue why and how
causal considerations are necessary when assessing fairness in the presence of
protected attributes. We achieve greater linguistic clarity for the discussion
of fairML and propose general algorithms for practical applications.

initialized and scattered by the SPI, the state of a light pulse depends on the

on the fully Hamiltonian resolution of the spin-light dynamics, we show that
quantum superpositions of zero and single photon states outperform coherent

In this context, inversions based on frequency separation ratios, that are less
sensitive to surface effects, appear as a promising technique to constrain the
properties of stellar convective cores. We developed an inversion based on
frequency separation ratios with the goal of damping the surface effects of the
oscillation frequencies. Using this new inversion, we defined a new indicator
to constrain the boundary mixing properties of convective cores in solar-like
oscillators. We verified our inversion technique by conducting tests in a
controlled environment, where the stellar mass and radius are known exactly,
and conducted an extensive hare and hounds exercise. The inversion is not
affected by surface effects. With the construction of an extensive set of
models, favoured and forbidden regions can be highlighted in the parameter
space. If the ratios are well fitted, the inversion is unsurprisingly not
providing additional information. The indicator coupled with the inversion

based on various mathematical formalisms have been made, most of these efforts
run into difficulties of one sort or another. One of the first detailed
descriptions was given by Sudarshan and his collaborators who, motivated by the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics, proposed a Hilbert space formulation
of classical-quantum interactions which made use of the Koopman-von Neumann
description of classical systems. Here we use the approach of ensembles on
configurations space to give a detailed account of a classical apparatus
measuring the position of a quantum particle that is prepared in a
superposition of two localized states. We show that the probability of the
pointer of the classical apparatus is left in a state that corresponds to the
probability of the quantum particle. A subsequent observation of the pointer
leads to an update of its probability density. From this we can obtain
information about the position of the quantum particle, leading to an update of
its wave function. Since this formalism incorporates uncertainties and finite
measurement precision, it is well suited for metrological applications.
Furthermore, it resolves fundamental issues that appear in the case of a
quantum description of the apparatus.

correlation algorithm in R open source software as well as an extension
designed to quantify persistent movement velocities in sequences of three or
more images. Algorithms are applied in the novel arena of landscape ecology to
quantify population movement and to produce vector fields for easy
visualization of complex movement patterns across space. Functions to
facilitate analyses are available in the ICvectorfields software package. These
methods and functions are likely to produce novel insights in theoretical and

objects or phenomena, constantly lead to the discovery of genuinely unforeseen
knowledge in astronomy. More unpredictable outliers will be uncovered in
principle with the increment of the coverage and quality of upcoming survey
data. However, it is a severe challenge to mine rare and unexpected targets
from enormous data with human inspection due to a significant workload.
Supervised learning is also unsuitable for this purpose since designing proper
training sets for unanticipated signals is unworkable. Motivated by these
challenges, we adopt unsupervised machine learning approaches to identify
outliers in the data of galaxy images to explore the paths for detecting
astronomical outliers. For comparison, we construct three methods, which are
built upon the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE)+
KNN, and CAE + KNN + Attention Mechanism (attCAE KNN) separately. Testing sets
are created based on the Galaxy Zoo image data published online to evaluate the
performance of the above methods. Results show that attCAE KNN achieves the
best recall (78%), which is 53% higher than the classical KNN method and 22%
higher than CAE+KNN. The efficiency of attCAE KNN (10 minutes) is also superior
to KNN (4 hours) and equal to CAE+KNN(10 minutes) for accomplishing the same
task. Thus, we believe it is feasible to detect astronomical outliers in the
data of galaxy images in an unsupervised manner. Next, we will apply attCAE KNN
to available survey datasets to assess its applicability and reliability.

learning, the dependency on extensive training data and the training costs, by
reusing obtained knowledge. However, the current DTL techniques suffer from
either catastrophic forgetting dilemma (losing the previously obtained
knowledge) or overly biased pre-trained models (harder to adapt to target data)
in finetuning pre-trained models or freezing a part of the pre-trained model,
respectively. Progressive learning, a sub-category of DTL, reduces the effect
of the overly biased model in the case of freezing earlier layers by adding a
new layer to the end of a frozen pre-trained model. Even though it has been
successful in many cases, it cannot yet handle distant source and target data.
We propose a new continual/progressive learning approach for deep transfer
learning to tackle these limitations. To avoid both catastrophic forgetting and
overly biased-model problems, we expand the pre-trained model by expanding
pre-trained layers (adding new nodes to each layer) in the model instead of
only adding new layers. Hence the method is named EXPANSE. Our experimental
results confirm that we can tackle distant source and target data using this
technique. At the same time, the final model is still valid on the source data,
achieving a promising deep continual learning approach. Moreover, we offer a
new way of training deep learning models inspired by the human education
system. We termed this two-step training: learning basics first, then adding
complexities and uncertainties. The evaluation implies that the two-step
training extracts more meaningful features and a finer basin on the error
surface since it can achieve better accuracy in comparison to regular training.
EXPANSE (model expansion and two-step training) is a systematic continual
learning approach applicable to different problems and DL models.

vector fields that generate the approach to equilibrium. Moreover, the rate
GENERIC structure also extends Onsager's variational principle. The MaxEnt
(Maximum Entropy) principle in the GENERIC structure becomes the Onsager
variational principle in the rate GENERIC structure. In the absence of external

production. In the presence of external forces when the entropy does not exist,
the rate entropy still exists. While the entropy at the conclusion of the

recent work, which employed a purely numerical approach for efficient
computation of exact exchange contribution in the conventional global hybrid
functionals through a range-separated (RS) technique. We make use of the
size-dependency based ansatz i.e., RS parameter, $\gamma$, is a functional of
density, $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, of which not much is known. To be consistent with
this ansatz, a novel procedure is presented that relates the characteristic
length of a given system (where $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ exponentially decays to
zero) with $\gamma$ self-consistently via a simple mathematical constraint. In
practice, $\gamma_{\mathrm{OT}}$ is obtained through an optimization of total
energy as follows: $\gamma_{\mathrm{OT}} \equiv \underset{\gamma
}{\mathrm{opt}} \ E_{\mathrm{tot},\gamma}$. It is found that the parameter
$\gamma_{\mathrm{OT}}$, estimated as above can show better performance in
predicting properties (especially from frontier orbital energies) than
conventional respective RSH functionals, of a given system. We have examined
the nature of highest fractionally occupied orbital from exact piece-wise
linearity behavior, which reveals that this approach is sufficient to maintain
this condition. A careful statistical analysis then illustrates the viability

that the localization of the energy of the particles can lead to the generation

discretionary lane-changing vehicle groups constitute a consecutive

lane-changing vehicles after lane-change; (2) the stimulative effect exists in
a consecutive lane-change situation and its influence is heterogeneous due to
different psychological activities of drivers; and (3) the utility prediction

for the unbounded quasi-periodic potential. With the Lyapunov exponent, we find
that there exists a critical region in the parameter $\lambda-E$ plane. The
critical region consists of critical states. In comparison with localized and

is much larger. The numerical results show that the scaling exponent of inverse

The reservoir properties (porosity, permeability) are treated as random

such as the fluids saturation, front propagation speed or breakthrough time. We
explore and use to our advantage the ability of networks to interpolate complex
high dimensional functions. We observe that the additional dimensions resulting
from a stochastic treatment of the partial differential equations tend to
produce smoother solutions on quantities of interest (distributions parameters)

proper parameterization of the uncertainty space, PINN can produce solutions
that match closely both the ensemble realizations and the stochastic moments.
We demonstrate applications for both homogeneous and heterogeneous fields of

methods. This approach gives rise to trained models that are both more robust
to variations in the input space and can compete in performance with
traditional stochastic sampling methods.

differential equations of fluid mechanics that are mathematically related by
their large-distance asymptotic behaviors in semi-infinite domains. The first
problem is that of the ""Sakiadis"" boundary layer over a moving flat wall, for
which no exact analytic solution has been put forward. The second problem is
that of a static air-liquid meniscus with surface tension that intersects a
flat wall at a given contact angle and limits to a flat pool away from the
wall. For the latter problem, the exact analytic solution -- given as distance
from the wall as function of meniscus height -- has long been known (Batchelor,
1967). Here, we provide an explicit solution as meniscus height vs. distance
from the wall to elucidate structural similarities to the Sakiadis boundary
layer. Although power series solutions are readily obtainable to the governing
nonlinear ordinary differential equations, we show that -- in both problems --
the series diverge due to non-physical complex or negative real-valued
singularities. In both cases, these singularities can be moved by expanding in
exponential gauge functions motivated by their respective large distance
asymptotic behaviors to enable series convergence over their full semi-infinite
domains. For the Sakiadis problem, this not only provides a convergent Taylor
series (and conjectured exact) solution to the ODE, but also a means to
evaluate the wall shear parameter (and other properties) to within any desired
precision. Although the nature of nonlinear ODEs precludes general conclusions,
our results indicate that asymptotic behaviors can be useful when proposing
variable transformations to overcome power series divergence.

neural structures underlying their words. Words remain 'in-situ', hence they
are always content-addressable. Arbitrary and novel sentences (with novel
words) can be created with 'neural blackboards' for words and sentences. Hence,
the unlimited productivity of natural language can be achieved with a 'fixed'
small world like network structure. The article focuses on the neural
blackboard for sentences. The architecture uses only one 'connection matrix'
for binding all structural relations between words in sentences. Its ability to
represent arbitrary (English) sentences is discussed in detail, based on a
comprehensive analysis of them. The architecture simulates intra-cranial brain
activity observed during sentence processing and fMRI observations related to
sentence complexity and ambiguity. The simulations indicate that the observed
effects relate to global control over the architecture, not to the sentence
structures involved, which predicts higher activity differences related to
complexity and ambiguity with higher comprehension capacity. Other aspects
discussed are the 'intrinsic' sentence structures provided by connection paths
and their relation to scope and inflection, the use of a dependency parser for
control of binding, long-distance dependencies and gaps, question answering,
ambiguity resolution based on backward processing without explicit
backtracking, garden paths, and performance difficulties related to embeddings.

particulate emissions do indeed occur during speech, to date, there is little

in participants producing isolated speech sounds: fricative consonants, plosive

tasks, a planar beam of laser light, a high-speed camera, and image software
calculated the number of particulates detected overtime. This study compares
airborne aerosols emitted by human participants at a distance of 2.54 cm
between the laser sheet and the mouth and reveals statistically significant
increases in particulate counts over ambient dust distribution for all speech
sounds. Vowel sounds were statistically greater than consonants, suggesting
that mouth opening, as opposed to place of vocal tract constriction or manner
of sound production, might be the primary influence in the degree to which
particulates become aerosolized during speech. Results of this research will
inform boundary conditions for computation models of aerosolized particulates

network slicing, spectrum sharing, and federated learning, rely on a
centralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single
point of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is
currently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things
(IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason,
mobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of
attention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users
must perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks
require energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT
users' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low
processing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on
commodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing.
To do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be
treated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity
servers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain
function virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be
performed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe
applications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by
the BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages
of BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy
consumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show
the performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption,
transaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.
